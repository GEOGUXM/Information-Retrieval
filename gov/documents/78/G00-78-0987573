   THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY

   THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMIC INSECURITY

      Social Security works because it speaks to a universal human need. All
      people throughout human history have faced the uncertainties brought on
      by death, disability and old age. Prior to the turn of the 20th
      century, the majority of people in the United States lived and worked
      on farms and economic security was provided by the extended family.
      However, this arrangement changed as America underwent the Industrial
      Revolution. The extended family and the family farm as sources of
      economic security became less common. Then, the Great Depression
      triggered a crisis in the nation's economic life. It was against this
      backdrop that the Social Security Act emerged.

   THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT

      On June 8, 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in a message to the
      Congress, announced his intention to provide a program for Social
      Security. Subsequently, the President created by Executive Order the
      Committee on Economic Security, which was composed of Frances Perkins,
      Secretary of Labor, Chairwoman; Henry Morgenthau, Jr., Secretary of the
      Treasury; Henry A. Wallace, Secretary of Agriculture; Homer S.
      Cummings, Attorney General; and Harry L. Hopkins, Federal Emergency
      Relief Administrator. The committee was instructed to study the entire
      problem of economic insecurity and to make recommendations that would
      serve as the basis for legislative consideration by the Congress.

   In early January 1935, the Committee made its report to the President,
   and on January 17 the President introduced the report to both Houses of
   Congress for simultaneous consideration. Each House passed its own
   version, but eventually the differences were resolved and the Social
   Security Act was signed into law on August 14, 1935. In addition to
   several provisions for general welfare, the new Act created a social
   insurance program designed to pay retired workers age 65 or older a
   continuing income after retirement.

IMPLEMENTING THE ACT

   One provision of the Act established a bipartisan Social Security Board
   (SSB) composed of three members appointed by the President. The
   original members were John G. Winant, Chairman; Arthur J. Altmeyer; and
   Vincent M. Miles. The SSB was faced with the tasks of providing
   employers, employees and the public with information on how earnings
   were to be reported, what benefits were available and how they were to
   be provided. In addition, sites for field installations had to be
   chosen and personnel to staff these offices had to be selected and
   trained.

   The monumental first task was the need to register employers and
   workers by January 1, 1937, when workers would begin acquiring credits
   toward old-age insurance benefits. Since the SSB did not have the
   resources available to accomplish this, they contracted with the U.S.
   Postal Service to distribute the applications, beginning in November
   1936. The post offices collected the completed forms, typed the Social
   Security number (SSN) cards, and returned the cards to the applicants.
   The applications then were forwarded to the SSB's processing center
   located in Baltimore, Maryland, where the numbers were registered and
   various employment records established. Over 35 million SSN cards were
   issued through this procedure in 1936-37.

   Owen of Concord, New Hampshire.

FIRST PAYMENTS

   Under the 1935 law, monthly benefits were to start in 1942. From 1937
   until 1942, Social Security was to pay benefits to retirees in the form
   of a single, lump-sum refund payment. The earliest reported applicant
   for a lump-sum refund was a retired Cleveland motorman named Ernest
   Ackerman, who retired one day after the Social Security program began.
   During his one day of participation in the program, a nickel was
   withheld from Mr. Ackerman's pay for Social Security, and, upon
   retiring, he received a lump-sum payment of 17 cents. The average
   lump-sum payment during this period was $58.06. The smallest payment
   ever made was for 5 cents.

1939 AMENDMENTS

   The original Act provided only retirement benefits, and only to the
   worker. The 1939 Amendments made a fundamental change in the Social
   Security program. The Amendments added two new categories of benefits:
   payments to the spouse and minor children of a retired worker
   (so-called dependents benefits) and survivors benefits paid to the
   family in the event of the premature death of the worker. This change
   transformed Social Security from a retirement program for individuals
   into a family-based economic security program. The 1939 Amendments also
   increased benefit amounts and accelerated the start of monthly benefit
   payments from 1942 to 1940.

MONTHLY BENEFITS

   Payments of monthly benefits began in January 1940. On January 31,
   1940, the first monthly retirement check was issued to a retired legal
   secretary, Ida May Fuller, of Ludlow, Vermont, in the amount of $22.54.
   Miss Fuller died in January 1975 at the age of 100. During her 35 years
   as a beneficiary, she received over $22,000 in benefits.

1950 AMENDMENTS

   From 1940 until 1950 virtually no changes were made in the Social
   Security program. Because the program was still in its infancy, Social
   Security's retirement benefits were very low. In fact, until 1951, the
   average welfare benefit received under the old-age assistance
   provisions of the Act was higher than the average retirement benefit
   received under Social Security. Only about 50% of America's workers
   were covered under the program at that time. In 1950 major amendments
   were enacted. These amendments raised benefits for the first time and
   placed the program on the road to the virtually universal coverage it
   has today.

THE STORY OF COLAS

   Most people are aware that there are annual increases in Social
   Security benefits to offset the effects of inflation on fixed incomes.
   These increases, known as Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs), are such
   an accepted feature of the program that it is difficult to imagine
   Social Security without them. But in fact, when Ida May Fuller received
   her first $22.54 benefit payment in January of 1940, this was the
   amount she could expect to receive for life. It was not until the 1950
   Amendments that Congress legislated the first COLA-- a 77 percent
   increase.

   From that point on, benefits were increased only when Congress enacted
   special legislation.

   In 1972, the law was changed to provide, beginning in 1975, for
   automatic annual COLAs based on the annual increase in consumer prices.
   No longer do beneficiaries have to await a special act of Congress to
   receive a benefit increase and no longer does inflation drain value
   from Social Security benefits.

   The Social Security Amendments of 1954 initiated a disability insurance
   program that provided the public with additional coverage against
   economic insecurity. At first, there was a disability "freeze" of
   workers' Social Security records during years when they were unable to
   work. While this measure offered no cash benefits, it did prevent such
   periods of disability from reducing or wiping out retirement and
   survivor benefits. On August 1, 1956, the Social Security Act was
   amended to provide benefits to disabled workers aged 50-65 and disabled
   adult children. Over the next 2 years, Congress broadened the scope of
   the program, permitting disabled workers under age 50 and their
   dependents to qualify for benefits, and eventually disabled workers at
   any age could qualify.

MEDICARE & OTHER CHANGES

   The decade of the 1960s brought additional changes to the Social
   Security program. Among the most significant was a provision in the
   Amendments of 1961 lowering the age at which men are first eligible for
   retirement benefits to 62 (women previously were given this option in
   1956).

   The most significant change involved the passage of Medicare. Under
   Medicare, health coverage was extended to Social Security beneficiaries
   aged 65 or older (and eventually to those receiving disability benefits
   as well). Nearly 20 million beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare in the
   first 3 years of the program. SSA would continue to have responsibility
   for all aspects of the Medicare program until a 1977 reorganization
   created the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). HCFA assumed
   administrative responsibility for Medicare at that time.

SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME

   In the original 1935 Social Security Act, programs were introduced for
   needy aged and blind individuals and, in 1950, needy disabled
   individuals were added. These three programs were known as the "adult
   categories" and were administered by State and local governments with
   partial Federal funding. Over the years, the State programs became more
   complex and inconsistent, with as many as 1,350 administrative agencies
   involved and payments varying more than 300% from State to State. In
   1969, President Nixon identified a need to reform these and related
   welfare programs to "bring reason, order, and purpose into a tangle of
   overlapping programs." In 1971, Secretary of Health, Education and
   Welfare, Elliot Richardson, proposed that the Social Security
   Administration (SSA) assume responsibility for the adult categories. In
   the Social Security Amendments of 1972, Congress federalized the adult
   categories by creating the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program
   and assigned responsibility for it to the SSA.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES SINCE 1980

   The Social Security Amendments of 1980 made many changes in the
   disability program. Most of these changes focused on various work
   incentive provisions for both Social Security and SSI disability
   benefits. The 1980 Amendments also required SSA to conduct periodic
   reviews of current disability beneficiaries to certify their continuing
   eligibility. This was to become a massive workload and one that was
   controversial. By 1983, the reviews had been halted, and in 1984,
   Congress passed the Disability Benefits Reform Act modifying several
   aspects of the disability program, including how disability reviews are
   conducted.

   In the early 1980s the Social Security program faced a serious
   financing crisis. President Ronald Reagan appointed a blue-ribbon
   panel, known as the Greenspan Commission, to study the financing issues
   and make recommendations for legislative changes. The final bill,
   signed into law in 1983, made numerous changes in the Social Security
   and Medicare programs, including the taxation of Social Security
   benefits; the first coverage of federal employees; raising the
   retirement age starting in 2000; and increasing the reserves in the
   Social Security Trust Funds.

   Under 1994 legislation, the periodic Social Security Advisory Councils
   were abolished and a permanent seven-member bipartisan Social Security
   Advisory Board was formed to provide independent advice and counsel on
   Social Security.

   In 1996, legislation changed the rules for qualifying for disability
   benefits. New applicants for Social Security or SSI disability benefits
   could no longer be eligible for benefits if drug addiction or
   alcoholism was a material factor in their disability.

   "Welfare reform" legislation, signed by President Clinton in August
   1996, terminated SSI eligibility for most non-citizens (this provision
   was scaled-back in 1997 legislation). Also the eligibility rules for
   awarding SSI disability benefits to children were tightened.

   On December 17, 1999, President Clinton signed the "Ticket to Work and
   Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999." This law provides disability
   beneficiaries with a voucher they may use to purchase vocational
   rehabilitation services, employment services, and other support
   services from an employment network of their choice. In addition to
   allowing beneficiaries to purchase vocational services, the law
   provides incentive payments to providers for successful rehabilitations
   in which the beneficiary returns to work. The new provisions also
   provide a number of safeguards to the beneficiaries to protect their
   benefits and health. Taken together, the Ticket to Work initiative
   seeks to shift the emphasis in the disability program away from mere
   maintenance of benefits more toward rehabilitating the disabled and
   assisting them in returning to productive work.

   On April 7, 2000, President Clinton signed into law H.R. 5, "The Senior
   Citizens' Freedom to Work Act of 2000," eliminating the Retirement
   Earnings Test (RET) for beneficiaries at or above Normal Retire- ment
   Age (NRA). (The RET still applies to beneficiaries below NRA.) This
   allowed approximately 900,000 people who were collecting benefits but
   also working to not have their benefits reduced because of work.

   PRESIDENTIAL QUOTES

   Each American President has strongly supported the Social Security
   program.

   FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
   "We can never insure one-hundred percent of the population against
   one-hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life. But we
   have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to
   the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and
   against poverty-ridden old age. This law, too, represents a cornerstone
   in a structure which is being built, but is by no means complete.... It
   is...a law that will take care of human needs and at the same time
   provide for the United States an economic structure of vastly greater
   soundness." -- August 14, 1935

   HARRY S. TRUMAN
   "Social Security...is not a dole or a device for giving everybody
   something for nothing. True Social Security must consist of rights
   which are earned rights -- guaranteed by the law of the land." --
   August 13, 1945

   DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
   We will...endeavor to administer the disability [program] efficiently
   and effectively, [and]...to help rehabilitate the disabled so that they
   may return to useful employment.... I am hopeful that this new
   law...will advance the economic security of the American people."--
   August 1, 1956

   JOHN F. KENNEDY
   "The Social Security program plays an important part in providing for
   families, children, and older persons in times of stress. But it cannot
   remain static. Changes in our population, in our working habits, and in
   our standard of living require constant revision." -- June 30, 1961

   LYNDON B. JOHNSON
   "One of the most urgent orders of business at this time is the
   enactment of hospital insurance for the aged through Social Security to
   help older people meet the high costs of illness without jeopardizing
   their economic independence." -- February 9, 1964

   RICHARD M. NIXON
   "I have today signed [legislation which]...constitutes a major
   breakthrough for older Americans, for it says at last that
   inflation-proof Social Security benefits are theirs as a matter of
   right...." -- July 1, 1972

   GERALD R. FORD
   "We must begin by insuring that the Social Security system is beyond
   challenge. [It is] a vital obligation each generation has to those who
   have worked hard and contributed to it all their lives." -- February 9,
   1976

   JIMMY E. CARTER
   "The Social Security program...represents our commitment as a society
   to the belief that workers should not live in dread that a disability,
   death, or old age could leave them or their families destitute." --
   December 20, 1977

   RONALD W. REAGAN
   "[This law] assures the elderly that America will always keep the
   promises made in troubled times a half century ago.... [The Social
   Security Amendments of 1983 are] a monument to the spirit of compassion
   and commitment that unites us as a people." -- April 20, 1983

   GEORGE H.W. BUSH
   "To every American out there on Social Security, to every American
   supporting that system today, and to everyone counting on it when they
   retire, we made a promise to you, and we are going to keep it." --
   January 31, 1990

   WILLIAM J. CLINTON
   "Social Security...reflects some of our deepest values -- the duties we
   owe to our parents, the duties we owe to each other when we're
   differently situated in life, the duties we owe to our children and our
   grandchildren. Indeed, it reflects our determination to move forward
   across generations and across the income divides in our country, as one
   America." -- February 9, 1998

   THE FUTURE OF SOCIAL SECURITY

   During the 1990s, Social Security faced long-term challenges. The 2000
   Trustees Report stated Social Security could pay full benefits until
   2037, but the standard 75-year test of actuarial balance was not met.

   A major impetus to the public debate on Social Security reform came in
   January 1998 when President Clinton announced in his State of the Union
   Address that we should "save Social Security first." The President also
   announced a series of forums around the country during the course of
   the year to engage the citizenry in an informed public debate,
   culminating in the first-ever White House Conference on Social Security
   in December 1998. Numerous proposals were introduced, suggesting strong
   interest in dealing with the long-term challenges facing the program.

THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL SECURITY TODAY

   Social Security has grown to become an essential facet of modern life.
   One in six Americans receives a Social Security benefit, and about 98
   percent of all workers are in jobs covered by Social Security. Social
   Security benefits comprise about 5% of the nation's total economic
   output. From 1940, when slightly more than 222,000 people received
   monthly Social Security benefits, until today, when almost 45 million
   people receive such benefits, Social Security has grown steadily. And
   Social Security benefits provide income security not just to the
   elderly. Nearly 1 in 3 beneficiaries are not retirees.

   The SSI program, meanwhile, provides needed income support to over 6
   million recipients, 31% of whom are aged individuals; 56% disabled
   adults; and 13% disabled children.

   SSA'S ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY

   The organization with administrative responsibility for the Social
   Security program is the Social Security Administration. This table
   summarizes the major organizational changes to SSA over the years:

   The Social Security Board is Created
   The Social Security Administration (SSA) began life as the Social
   Security Board (SSB). The SSB was created at the moment President
   Roosevelt inked his signature on the Social Security Act (August 14,
   1935). The SSB was an entirely new entity, with no staff, no facilities
   and no budget. The initial personnel were donated from existing
   agencies, and a temporary budget was obtained from the Federal
   Emergency Relief Administration. The Board itself consisted of three
   executives appointed by the President and such staff as they needed to
   hire.

   The Federal Security Agency Absorbs the Board

   On 7/1/39 the Social Security Board lost its independent agency status
   when the new sub-cabinet level Federal Security Agency was created. The
   FSA encompassed the SSB, the Public Health Service, the Office of
   Education, the Civilian Conservation Corps, and the U.S. Employment
   Service.

   SSA is Created

   On 7/16/46 the SSB was renamed the Social Security Administration under
   the President's Reorganization Plan of 1946. Arthur Altmeyer, who had
   been chairman of the Board of the SSB, became SSA's first Commissioner.

   HEW Replaces the Federal Security Agency
   On 4/11/53 President Eisenhower abolished the FSA and created a new
   Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW). SSA was made part of
   this new cabinet agency.

   HEW Replaced by HHS
   On 5/4/80 the Department of Health and Human Services replaced HEW. SSA
   was a major part of HHS until it returned to its original status as an
   independent agency.

   SSA Becomes an Independent Agency
   Throughout the years, arguments had been made that SSA should be
   returned to independent agency status. This debate was given impetus in
   1981 when the National Commission on Social Security recommended that
   SSA once again become an independent Social Security Board. The 1983
   National Commission on Social Security Reform (a.k.a., the Greenspan
   Commission) again raised this issue and recommended a special study be
   commissioned of the matter. This special study was completed in 1984
   and it outlined several options for making SSA an independent agency.
   This led to numerous legislative proposals in the ensuing years and in
   1994 the legislation passed both houses of Congress unanimously.
   President Clinton signed the bill on August 15, 1994 (59 years and one
   day after FDR signed the original Act). (The change took effect on
   March 31, 1995.)

   SOCIAL SECURITY BOARD MEMBERS

   From 1935 until 1946, the Social Security program was the
   responsibility of a three-person executive board known as the Social
   Security Board. Although one member was designated as the Chairman, all
   three members had equal status and each had one vote in Board
   decisions. During this 11-year period, six different individuals were
   members of the Social Security Board.
