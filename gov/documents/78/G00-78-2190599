                     The Crater Lake Data Clearinghouse
                        http://craterlake.wr.usgs.gov

      The Crater Lake Data Clearinghouse is designed to ensure that all
        interested users -- scientists, engineers, resource managers,
     developers, and the public -- have quick and easy access to a wide
   range of data and GIS products. The primary goal of this clearinghouse
       is to facilitate the coordination of research, monitoring, and
    environmental management activities in Crater Lake, and to ensure the
     widest possible access to data and information resulting from such
   activities. Some of the data resides on the USGS server at the Western
      Mapping Center, Menlo Park, California. The bulk of the data and
       information, located in databases maintained by the partnering
    agencies, is accessible from this clearinghouse via hypertext links.

    "Since the discovery of gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills in 1848,
      the SF Bay and Delta region has undergone rapid, large-scale, and
    permanent changes. To help understand the extent and impact of these
   changes, the USGS has maintained a broad program of multi-disciplinary
    research studies in the San Francisco Bay estuary and its watershed."
