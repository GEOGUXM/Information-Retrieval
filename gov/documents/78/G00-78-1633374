                    Mission of the Water Resources Division

   The U.S. Geological Survey has the principal responsibility within the
   Federal Government to provide the hydrologic information and
   understanding needed by others to achieve the best use and management
   of the Nation's water resources. To accomplish this mission, the Water
   Resources Division, in cooperation with State, local, and other Federal
   agencies,
     * Systematically collects and analyzes data to evaluate the quantity,
       quality, and use of the Nation's water resources and provides
       results of these investigations to the public.
     * Conducts water-resources appraisals describing the occurrence,
       availability, and physical, chemical, and biological
       characteristics of surface and ground water.
     * Conducts basic and problem-oriented hydrologic and related research
       that aids in alleviating water resources problems and provides an
       understanding of hydrologic systems sufficient to predict their
       response to natural or human-caused stress.
     * Coordinates the activities of Federal agencies in the acquisition
       of water resources data for streams, lakes, reservoirs, estuaries,
       and ground water.
     * Provides scientific and technical assistance in hydrologic fields
       to other Federal, State, and local agencies, to licensees of the
       Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and to international agencies
       on behalf of the Department of State.
     * Administers the State Water Resources Research Institutes Program
       and the National Water Resources Research Grants Program.
