                Oklahoma Geological Survey 24 Hour magnetograms

  These are recorded ner Leonard, Oklahoma. Each magnetogram begins at
  00:00:00.00 UTC/GMT and ends at 23:59:59.75. The time axis is labeled in
  GMT/UTC hours. magmZ (green trace) is the vertical magnetic intensity. magmD
  (red trace) is the declination which is the horizontal component in a
  direction of magnetic east-west (5 degrees south of east near Leonard), and
  magmH is the Horizontal component in the magnetic north-south direction, which
  is 5 degrees east of geographic North in the Leonard area.

   The vertical axis is in nanoTesla or gamma relative to an arbitrary
   baseline. The baselines are approximately 0 nT (nanoTesla) for D, 22275
   nT for H, and 48175 nT for Z. The three "lanes" are nearly but not
   exactly equal in height. The SAC software scales each lane to reach
   from the highest value to the lowest value for the given day. Because
   the mean value is removed and the height rescaled for each component
   for each day, the traces will not line up on printouts for different
   days.

   The magnetic field is sensed by a three component Narod S100 ring-core
   magnetometer. The output voltages are sampled 2000 times per second by
   a Guralp 16 bit DM16-R8 digitizer. The samples are filtered and
   decimated by factors of 10, 10, and 5. This produces four samples per
   second. The four samples per second are transmitted to a PC running
   Guralp SCREAM data acquisition software. SCREAM produces 24 hour files
   for each component. The files are plotted with Lawrence Livermore
   National Labs Seismic Analysis Code. After plotting on a Sun SPARC 20,
   the magnetograms are converted to gif image files by ImageMagick
   software.

   The digitizer time-tags the samples with signals from Global
   Positioning System satellites.
