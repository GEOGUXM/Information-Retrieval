       [buildingE.jpg] Section 8017  of the Public Resources Code mandates
       that the Department maintain a mapping information service in
       Sacramento.  That service is located in Room 150 of the Resources
       Building, 1416 Ninth Street, Sacramento.
       This section maintains aerial photography of Department projects
       and special events such as floods.  In addition, photography taken
       at the requests of other agencies or in cooperation with them is
       maintained at this location.  Parks and Recreation, Fish and Game,
       State Lands, Forestry and other agencies have contracted for work
       from this section.
       Over 650,000 aerial photos, 5,000 topographical maps, and USGS
       quadrangles are available for viewing.   This section develops,
       establishes and maintains standards for photogrammetry products
       produced for and by the Department.
       Please be patient!  We have only begun the long and arduous task of
       pulling it all together to make it all available on the World Wide
       Web.  Our in-house listing of aerial photography is currently
       rather simple in format.  If you take a careful look, though,
       you'll see that the amount of photography available is huge, and
       will get bigger.
       We also plan to have a search engine in place for our database to
       make finding photos of specific areas easier.  This will take time
       and some mammoth storage space (possibly as much as terabyte).  In
       the mean time, try using the menu commands "Edit/Find (on/in this
       page)..." in your web browser.
       If you have a need for aerial photography and have found something
       in the listing that interests you, please call (916) 653-2698 for
       further information on how to obtain copies.
