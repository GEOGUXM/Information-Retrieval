Standards Subgroup

   The primary objective of the Standards Subgroup is as follows:
    1. Identify and prioritize the issues that result from NASA's
       anticipated move to rely more on commercial, voluntary, or
       international standards in software engineering, and make
       recommendations on how to resolve issues.
