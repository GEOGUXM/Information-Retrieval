   Waterfowl Reservation Lists

   Important: Even if your information appears on a reservation list, you
   must present your reservation postcard at the check station before the
   specified check-in time. These lists are generated from information
   submitted by hunters on their reservation applications. The Department
   of Fish and Game is not responsible for inaccurate information
   submitted by hunters.

   Reservation lists contain the hunting license number, date of birth and
   city of residence of reservation holders. You can check to see if you
   were drawn for a reservation by searching the lists for your hunting
   license number.  You may search for your hunting license number using
   either a manual search or Adobe Acrobat search.  Print this screen and
   follow the instructions below.

   Manual Search:
       1. Select a hunt date from the calendar below.  Please be patient
          while the file is being downloaded.  This may take a few minutes.
       2. Find the hunt area that you applied for. The report is arranged
          alphabetically by hunt area name. The hunt area is located at the
          top of each page and is in BOLD.
       3. Once you find the hunt area, search the reservation listing for
          your hunting license number. The list is ordered by hunting license
          number. Note: The "H" is not included in your hunting license
          number.
       4. If your hunting license number is not found, then you were not
          drawn for a reservation.
       5. If your hunting license number is on this list, verify that your
          date of birth and city match those listed in the file. If your
          hunting license number, date of birth and city of residence match
          those listed then you should receive a reservation postcard in the
          mail.

      Adobe Acrobat Search
   :

    1. Select a hunt date from the calendar below.  Please be patient
       while the file is being downloaded.  This may take a few minutes.
    2. Click on the binoculars icon on the toolbar of the Adobe Acrobat
       Reader.
    3. Enter your hunting license number in the "find" screen. Do not
       enter the "H" or dash portion of your hunting license number. Enter
       only numerals.
    4. If your hunting license number is not found, then you were not
       drawn for a reservation.
    5. If your hunting license number is on this list, verify that your
       date of birth and city match those listed in the file. If your
       hunting license number, date of birth and city of residence match
       those listed then you should receive a reservation postcard in the
       mail.
