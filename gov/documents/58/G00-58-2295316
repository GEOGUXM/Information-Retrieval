                  The Data Analysis and Collection Programs
           DAMIS (Drug and Alcohol Management Information System):
     * Background: The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991
       mandated that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) publish
       regulations, issued in February 1994, which require transit systems
       and their contractors to establish prohibited drug use and alcohol
       misuse prevention programs. The rules require that the test results
       of these programs be reported to the FTA annually on March 15.
       These results must be submitted on FTA Drug and Alcohol Testing MIS
       Data Collection Forms, originally published in the Federal Register
       (49 CFR Parts 653 and 654) and attached at the end of this guidance
       letter or via CD/diskette reporting software. Data provided on the
       2000 MIS Data Collection Forms must cover the entire calendar year
       (i.e., January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2000).

                SAMIS (Safety Management Information System):
     * About SAMIS Data Reporting: In its ninth year of publication, the
       Safety Management Information Statistics (SAMIS) Annual Report
       continues to provide uniformly collected comprehensive safety and
       security data.  These data are collected from all recipients or
       beneficiaries of Urbanized Area Formula funds through the National
       Transit Database (NTD) Reporting System.
       Purchased Transportation consists of public transit agencies or
       private carriers who provide public mass transportation services
       under contract to recipients of Urbanized Area Formula funds.
       Purchased Transportation reported data are only for those services
       provided under contract.  A list of all reporters is included in
       the body of this report.
       Transit safety data are collected in four basic categories:
       Collisions, Derailments / Buses going off road, Personal
       Casualties, and Fires.  Each of these categories is further
       delineated in order to obtain detailed information on the exact
       nature of the incident.  All transit agencies subject to NTD
       reporting are required to report safety data.
       Transit security data are modeled after the Federal Bureau of
       Investigations Uniform Crime Reporting System, using standardized
       offense definitions.  Two types of security data are collected:
       reports of Part I (crime index) offenses, and arrests for Part II
       (most other) offenses.  Transit agencies serving urbanized areas
       (UZAs) with populations of 200,000 or more are required to report
       security data.
