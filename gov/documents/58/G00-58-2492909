                         FOREIGN ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

                                  June 2001

   This listing is for U.S. citizens traveling on tourism/business and
   does not apply to persons planning to emigrate to foreign countries.
   Persons traveling on official business for the U.S. Government should
   obtain visa information from the agency sponsoring their travel. For
   purposes of this publication, a visa is an endorsement or stamp placed
   by officials of a foreign country on a U.S. passport that allows the
   bearer to visit that foreign country. Note: Wherever you see the words
   "photo(s) required" in this publication, it generally means that you
   will need to submit passport-size (2"x2") photographs.

   IMPORTANT: THIS LISTING IS PREPARED FROM INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM
   FOREIGN EMBASSIES PRIOR TO APRIL 2001. THIS INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO
   CHANGE. CHECK ENTRY REQUIREMENTS WITH THE CONSULAR OFFICIALS OF THE
   COUNTRIES TO BE VISITED WELL IN ADVANCE.

   PASSPORTS: U.S. citizens who travel to a country where a valid passport
   is not required will need documentary evidence of their U.S.
   citizenship and identity. Proof of U.S. citizenship includes an expired
   U.S. passport, a certified (original) birth certificate, Certificate of
   Naturalization, Certificate of Citizenship, or Report of Birth Abroad
   of a Citizen of the United States. To prove identity, a valid driver's
   license or government identification card are acceptable provided they
   identify you by physical description or photograph. However, for travel
   overseas and to facilitate reentry into the U.S., a valid U.S. passport
   is the best documentation available and unquestionably proves your U.S.
   citizenship.

   Before you send your passport through the mail to apply for a visa,
   sign it in ink, and write in pencil your current address and daytime
   telephone number in the space provided. This will help the U.S. Postal
   Service return it to you should it become separated from the envelope
   during processing.

   Some countries require that your U.S. passport be valid at least six
   months or longer beyond the dates of your trip. If your passport
   expires before the required validity, you will have to apply for a new
   one. Please check with the embassy or nearest consulate of the country
   that you plan to visit for their requirements.

   Some Middle Eastern or African countries will not issue visas or allow
   entry if your passport indicates travel to Israel. Consult the National
   Passport Information Center (1-900-225-5674 or TDD: 1-900-225-7778 (fee
   of $0.35 per minute), or 1-888-362-8668 or TDD: 1-888-498-3648 (flat
   fee of $4.95 for people using a major credit card)) for guidance if
   this applies to you.

   VISAS: If a visa is required, obtain it from the appropriate foreign
   consular representative before proceeding abroad. Allow sufficient time
   for processing your visa application, especially if you are applying by
   mail. Most foreign consular representatives are located in principal
   cities, and in many instances, a traveler may be required to obtain
   visas from the consular office in the area of his/her residence. IT IS
   THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE TRAVELER TO OBTAIN VISAS, WHERE REQUIRED,
   FROM THE APPROPRIATE EMBASSY OR NEAREST CONSULATE OF THE COUNTRY YOU
   ARE PLANNING TO VISIT. As soon as you receive your visa, check it to
   make sure no mistakes were made. Processing and visa fees vary, and
   most fees may not be refundable, consult the embassy or consulate of
   the country you plan to visit for specific details.

   IMMUNIZATIONS: Under the International Health Regulations adopted by
   the World Health Organization, a country may require International
   Certificates of Vaccination against yellow fever, especially if you are
   traveling from an area of the world that is infected with yellow fever.
   Check with health care providers or your records to ensure other
   immunizations (e.g. tetanus and polio) are up-to-date. Prophylactic
   medication for malaria and certain other preventive measures are
   advisable for travel to some countries. No immunizations are required
   to return to the United States. Detailed health information is included
   in Health Information for International Travel, available from the U.S.
   Government Printing Office (address on page 20) for $20 or may be
   obtained from your local health department or physician or by
   contacting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, telephone
   1-877-FYI-TRIP (1-877-394-8747), toll-free autofax: 1-888-CDC-FAXX
   (1-888-232-3299), or Internet: http://www.cdc.gov.

   AIDS/HIV TESTING: An increasing number of countries have established
   regulations regarding AIDS testing, particularly for long-term
   visitors. Although many are listed here, check with the embassy or
   consulate of the country that you plan to visit to verify if this is a
   requirement for entry.

   ADDITIONAL FEES: All international flights are subject to U.S.
   Immigration and U.S. Customs fees paid in advance as part of your
   ticket. In addition, many countries have departure fees that are
   sometimes collected at the time of ticket purchase or upon exiting the
   foreign country.
