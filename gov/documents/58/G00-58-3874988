                                 Metaphysics

   Philosophies traditionally start with a metaphysics: a theory of the
   essence of things, of the fundamental principles that organize the
   universe. Metaphysics is supposed to answer the question "What is the
   nature of reality?" (see Metaphysics, introduction). But we cannot
   answer this question without first understanding what is the meaning of
   metaphysics, if any, and in what respect metaphysics differs from
   science, which tries to answer similar questions but through more
   concrete methods. Metaphysics is traditionally subdivided in ontology,
   the theory of being in itself, and cosmology, the theory describing the
   origin and structure of the universe.

   In a traditional systems philosophy "organization" might be seen as the
   fundamental principle of being, rather than God, matter, or the laws of
   nature. However it still begs the question where this organization
   comes from. In our evolutionary-systemic philosophy, on the other hand,
   the essence is the process through which this organization is created.
   Therefore, our ontology starts from elementary actions, rather than
   from static objects, particles, energy or ideas. These actions are the
   primitive elements, the building blocks of our vision of reality, and
   therefore remain undefined. Actions are in not general not
   deterministic but involve an element of freedom. A sequence of actions
   constitutes a process. Our ontology is thus related to the process
   metaphysics of Whitehead and Teilhard de Chardin. Its historical origin
   can be traced back even further to the development from Kant to
   Schopenhauer.

   Relatively stable "systems" are constructed by such processes through
   the mechanism of variation and selection. This leads to the spontaneous
   emergence of more complex organizations during evolution: from
   space-time and elementary particles, to atoms, molecules, crystals,
   DNA, cells, plants, animals, humans, and human society and culture (see
   the history of evolution). This developmental sequence provides us with
   a basis for our cosmology. Because of this self-organization of the
   universe, there is no need to posit a personal God, distinct from the
   universe, as an explanation for the observed complexity.

   Events of emergence are the "quanta" of evolution. They lead to the
   creation of new systems with new identities, obeying different laws and
   possessing different properties. In such systems, the behaviour of the
   whole depends on the behaviour of the parts (a "reductionistic" view),
   but the behaviour of the parts is at the same time constrained or
   directed by the behaviour of the whole (a "holistic" view). (see
   downward causation)

   A fundamental type of emergence is the "meta-system transition" , which
   results in a higher level of control while increasing the overall
   freedom and adaptivity of the system. Examples of metasystem
   transitions are the emergence of multicellular organisms, the emergence
   of the capacity of organisms to learn, and the emergence of human
   intelligence.
