                                     Question

                                name         Ben I.
                               status       student
                                  age          15

       Question -   How do biologists determine the amino acid sequence of a
                                 protein molecule?

     It is NOT simple...but a whole lot easier than it was for the first group
    who figured out the 51 amino acids that make up insulin. To day one of the
    first steps is figuring how many chains are in the protein.  We do this by
    finding out how many end (called C and N termini) are in a single protein.
      Then we have to digest any disulfide bonds that cross-link the protein
   chain...Ten we separate the protein chains in a gel filtration.  Then before
    we find the actual sequence we like to know the total # of different amino
     acids in each chain.  This is done by a machine which separates the amino
   acids based on their ionic charges. Once all this is done there are a number
    of ways to figure out the sequence...An "old fashion way is the protein is
   chopped up (cleaved ) by certain enzymes and then the fragments are analyzed
          for overlapping similarities.  Mass spectrometry is also used.

   Ben, there are two ways to go about this. In the "old days," one would purify
      as much of the protein as possible, and then subject it to a series of
   chemical reactions. The reaction would break off the "last" amino acid in the
    chain, and then scientists would use a machine to determine which of the 20
   possible amino acids it was. Then the cycle would start again: break off the
   new "last" amino acid on the chain, identify it, etc. The process was largely
      automated, but is still technically challenging to do. You need a good
       preparation of pure protein, and even then, you might only be able to
   identify about the last dozen amino acids in the chain, since you take losses
                          at every step of the procedure.

      Nowadays, the sequence is often not obtained directly from the protein.
   Rather, the PREDICTED amino acid sequence is determined by sequencing the DNA
   that encodes the protein. This is actually the easier way, using DNA cloning
    technology. The gene is cloned, and the order of the bases (the "rungs" of
     the DNA ladder) is determined by a series of reactions that is (sort of)
    similar in concept to the way proteins are sequenced. When you have the DNA
   sequence, you look for the information that encodes the protein; it's sort of
    like reading the Morse code and printing out the coded words. Bear in mind
    that this information allows you to _predict_ the sequence of the protein,
      but on rare occasions the actual protein sequence may differ (technical
                                   disclaimer).

   Incidentally, a nice gentleman named Fred Sanger was instrumental in working
   out the first method to sequence the actual protein. For this he was awarded
   the Nobel Prize. Many years later, he was instrumental in working out the way
    we presently sequence DNA; for this, he was awarded his second Nobel Prize!
