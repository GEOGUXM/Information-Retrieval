   Graff (DX-2) 0.65 Estane® 5703 is a polymeric elastomer that is used as
   part of the binder in the high-explosive 0.55 (HE) formulation PBX
   9501. How this polymer chemically degrades as it ages, and 0.45 how
   that is then reflected in its mechanical 0.35 properties and the
   properties of PBX 9501 are absorbance important issues for the surety
   of the stockpile. 0.25 Other Estane® materials (and closely related
   formulations) are used in a wide variety of 0.15 commercial

   different thermal and mechanical perturbations, is part of a larger
   program that Microphase Separation Spectral Changes is developing a
   physically-based model of the 0.02 material, including its aging
