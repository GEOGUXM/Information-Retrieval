     * Evaluate Omniviz Cluster Visualization Tool
     * New Array Analysis and Display Tool
     * Finch Suite of Sequence Analysis and Storage Applications Available
     * User's Question Answered

   The ABCC recently added or upgraded several pieces of software that
   should be of use to the local scientific community.

  Genomica Discovery Manager Program

   We have upgraded the genomica discovery manager program. Discovery
   Manager is an application that is designed to house all of the data
   from genetics laboratories. The program can be used to collect
   information from pedigrees and haplotype information, conduct linkage
   analysis, correlate physical mapping results and finally collect
   sequencing and blast results all under one application. The program has
   already been of use to several users. An instructional tutorial session
   will be scheduled for early in 2001, so please contact Bob Stephens if
   you are interested. In the interim period, you can have a look at the
   manual to see if the program will be of any use in aiding your
   research.

  Evaluate Omniviz Cluster Visualization Tool

   We have obtained an evaluation copy of the omniviz cluster
   visualization tool. Omniviz allows users to perform visualization of
   complex clustered data such as that obtained from gene expression
   experiments like those produced from microarray analysis. We currently
   have two copies of the program installed for users to try and two
   copies of the tutorial instruction manual. Please contact Bob Stephens
   for more information.

  New Array Analysis and Display Tool

   We have also been working with Dr. Peter Lemkin of the Laboratory of
   Experimental and Computational Biology, DBS, NCI-Frederick. Dr. Lemkin
   has also made an array analysis and display tool that is very robust,
   can be run either as an applet or an application and has many features
   being added almost daily. We have been trying to get the many sources
   of microarray data (e.g., Affymetrix, Incyte and NCI) to all work
   seamlessly with Dr. Lemkin's program and have currently added the
   capability to work with the Incyte Gem data.

   The Microarray Explorer can be seen at
   http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/MAExplorer. We hope to eventually be able
   to use this tool to compare data from experiments performed with these
   different technologies directly.

  Finch Suite of Sequence Analysis and Storage Applications Available

   The ABCC recently acquired the finch suite of sequence analysis and
   storage applications. These tools allow for the storage and retrieval
   of raw and processed sequence information. The platform can also be
   used to submit sequencing requests to the Molecular Technology
   Laboratory in either 96well or individual analysis. The request
   information as well as any of the derived sequence information can then
   be viewed or retrieved via the web.

  Question Sent in by a User
  How often does the motif ACTG occur in a base sequence?

     ******>>> ASSUMING A=25%, T=25%, C=25%, G=25%
     ******>>> AND BASES RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED

   LET:

     P(p) = probability of pattern, ie. P(ACTG) = probability of ACTG

     P(a) = probability of A at a sequence position
     P(t) = probability of T at a sequence position
     P(c) = probability of C at a sequence position
     P(g) = probability of G at a sequence position

     * => multiplication
     ** => exponentiation

     P(p) = P(ACTG) = P(a) * P(c) * P(t) * P(g)

     P(p) = 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.003906250

  How often should we expect to see ACTG?

     1 / P(p)

     1 / 0.003906250 = 256

     ACTG should occur on average once every 256 bases

     Now let GC content be 66.3%,
     then AT = 33.7%, and assume G=33.15%, C=33.15%, A=16.85%, T=16.85%

     P(p) = P(ACTG) = P(a) * P(c) * P(t) * P(g)

     P(ACTG) = 0.1685 * 0.3315 * 0.1685 * 0.3315 = 0.003120088

     1 / 0.003120088 = 320.5 bases Once every ~321 bases.

  How often would you expect the pattern gctggtgg to occur in DNA sequences with
  a GC content of 66.3%?

     P(a) = 0.1685
     P(t) = 0.1685
     P(c) = 0.3315
     P(g) = 0.3315

     Pattern gctggtgg contains 5 g's, 2 t's, and 1 c

     P(p) = (0.3315 ** 5) * (0.1685 ** 2) * (0.3315) = 0.000037679

     1 / P(p) = 26539.9 ~ every 26.5 kb

     Consider AYG, or RGC

     P(AYG) = P(a) * (P(c)+P(t)) * P(g)

     P(RGC) = (P(a)+P(g)) * P(g) * P(c)

  What about GNT?

     P(GNT) = P(g) * (P(a)+P(g)+P(c)+P(t)) * P(t)

     or

     P(GNT) = P(g) * 1 * P(t) = P(g) * P(t)

  NOTE:

   All this is assuming that the bases are randomly distributed in the
   sequence, and this is not the case for "real" sequences. Some patterns
   occur more frequently and some less than would be indicated from a
   simple analysis such as this.

   As an example consider Genbank accession L19268, Homo sapiens myotonic
   dystrophy associated protein kinase mRNA, complete cds 2726 bp. Using
   the Wisconsin Package GCG program Composition
   (which gives mono, di, and trinucleotide counts for a sequence), we
   get:

   for mononucleotide base counts, A: 459 C: 865 G: 902 T: 500
   and for these 2 trinucleotides, ATA: 3 CTG: 99

   Using the above method we would expect to see approximately 14
   occurrences of ATA, and approximately 53 occurrences of CTG in a
   sequence of 2726 base pairs. ATA occurs much less often and CTG much
   more often than expected with the above calculation.

   If we use the Wisconsin Package program Shuffle
   to randomize the order of the bases in L19268, and then run
   Composition, we will see values close to 14 for ATA and 53 for CTG,
   more in line with the above method.
