           5.3    COMMERCE IMAGE . The purpose of this chapter is to
   describe National Weather Service (NWS) policy and management
   responsibilities for the authorization of radio frequency (RF) use and
   to ensure adherence to requirements dictated by the reference
   Department of Commerce (DOC)/National Telecommunications and
   Information Administration (NTIA) Manual of Regulations and Procedures
   for Federal Radio Frequency Management (NTIA Manual). Radio frequency
   authorization requests, the procedures and formats that are needed to
   convert them into RF authorizations (RFA), and the organizational
   functions that are necessary to process them are described.

   2.     Background. All nations share the electromagnetic spectrum.
   International cooperation in electromagnetic spectrum use is necessary
   to minimize interference and to ensure the most effective use of that
   spectrum. The United Nations recognizes the International
   Telecommunications Union (ITU) as being responsible for maintaining
   cooperation to improve all telecommunications. The ITU allocates the
   international RF spectrum, registers frequency assignments, coordinates
   the resolution of interference, and allots call signs. The
   Plenipotentiary Conference is the supreme agency of the ITU. It
   formulates general policies, establishes budgetary guidelines, elects
   members, and concludes agreements between the ITU and other
   international communications organizations. The agency has three
   subordinate groups:

       The World Administrative Radio Conference
       The International Frequency Registration Board
       The International Radio Consultative Committee

   The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, governs RF spectrum use in
   the United States and its possessions. The Act established two spectrum
   management agencies--the NTIA and the Federal Communications Commission
   (FCC). The NTIA regulates the spectrum use of federally operated radio
   stations. The FCC regulates the spectrum use of radio stations that are
   not operated by the Federal Government.

   The Communications Act of 1934 gave control of Government radio
   stations to the President. Executive Order 12046 established the NTIA
   in 1978 to act as the President's agent in telecommunications matters.
   The NTIA is now under the DOC.

   The Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC), established by
   Presidential Order in 1922, is the policy-making agency of the NTIA.
   Most often, frequency managers deal with this committee. The IRAC
   consists of representatives from the following:

     Department of Agriculture
     Department of the Air Force
     Department of the Army
     Department of Commerce
     Department of Energy
     Department of Health and Human Services
     Department of the Interior
     Department of Justice
     Department of the Navy
     Department of State
     Department of the Treasury
     Department of Veterans Affairs
     Federal Aviation Administration
     Federal Emergency Management Agency
     General Services Administration
     National Aeronautics and Space Administration
     National Science Foundation
     United States Coast Guard
     United States Information Agency
     United States Postal Service

   The IRAC's daily functions are carried out by four subcommittees: the
   Frequency Assignment Subcommittee (FAS), Spectrum Planning
   Subcommittee, Technical Subcommittee, and International Notification
   Group.

   The Communications Act of 1934 also created the FCC as an independent
   Government agency directly accountable to Congress. The FCC regulates
   non-Federal government telecommunications. The FCC also maintains a
   liaison at all IRAC meetings and works with its subcommittees even
   though the FCC is not an IRAC member. The liaison is the cross-over
   point for spectrum management actions requiring FCC coordination. The
   FCC is also the focal point in the United States for the distribution
   of call signs with direct coordination from the ITU to nongovernment
   users and to Federal Government agencies (see the list of IRAC members
   above).

   The NWS, as a part of the DOC, may use only specific parts of the radio
   frequency spectrum after being authorized to do so by the DOC
   representative to the IRAC, who in turn must obtain authorization from
   the IRAC. The NWS must formally apply for RFAs for each use in any
   other part of the spectrum. It has authority to issue some call signs
   from blocks allotted to it by the FCC.

   The interdepartmental Hydrologic Radio Frequency Coordination Group
   (HRFCG), under the standing chair of the NWS Office of Hydrology,
   advises the IRAC and the FCC on applications by Federal and non-Federal
   users for proposed use of U.S. Government hydrologic frequencies. Any
   radio frequency assignment request for these frequencies must be
   reviewed and approved by the HRFCG prior to the requester forwarding,
   via NWS Headquarters (WSH), the final application package to the DOC
   for frequency assignment.

   3.     Description. The RFA request is transmitted from the using
   organization in an informational format that must be formally provided
   through the DOC to the NTIA. It requests authorization (licensing) for
   the NWS to operate a radio frequency transmitter. For the purposes of
   this chapter, any device that emits a radio wave (voice/data, radar,
   radiosonde, satellite-associated Earth station, telemetry, etc.) is a
   transmitter and must be considered for licensing. Among the information
   required by the NTIA are the radio-associated parameters such as
   transmitter location, frequency, and power and antenna location, type,
   gain, orientation, height above ground, and height above sea level. The
   precise information and format required are detailed in Chapter 9 of
   the NTIA Manual. The information required in the RFA request enables
   the DOC FAS representative to enter the RFA request data into a data
   base of the Government Master File, which can be accessed by members of
   the FAS so that they can coordinate and review the request. The NTIA
   and all agencies within the Federal Government then concur or do not
   concur with the request. Assuming concurrence, the NTIA will issue an
   RFA to the DOC, who will in turn issue an RFA to the NWS. If there is
   not concurrence, the NWS must coordinate with the non-concurring agency
   to resolve any conflicts prior to the NTIA issuing an RFA to the NWS.

   For clarity, the following definitions have been reprinted from
   paragraph 6.2, "Frequency Nomenclature," of the NTIA Manual. These
   terms are used to describe the distribution of frequencies of bands of
   frequencies.

     Allocations (of portions of the spectrum) are made to radio
     services, for example, the fixed service, the aeronautical mobile
     service, and the space research service.

     Allotments (of frequencies under specified transmission conditions)
     are made to areas or countries and, within the U.S. Government, to
     specific uses.

     Assignments are instruments of Authorization of discrete frequencies
     to specific radio stations. (Authority to transmit and the specific
     conditions under which that transmission may take place.)

   Additionally, the FCC issues licenses to individual citizens and
   corporations. The Federal Government receives RFAs.

   4.     Procedures. Upon determining the planned need for a radio
   transmission device, and well in advance of the date the authorization
   will be needed, the appropriate NWS project personnel should coordinate
   the radio requirement with the WSH Radio Frequency Manager or the
   regional headquarters radio frequency focal point and produce the
   information required for an RFA request in the specified format. The
   information and format requirements may be determined by referring to
   Chapter 9 of the NTIA manual or, if necessary, by contacting the
   regional headquarters radio frequency focal point or the WSH Radio
   Frequency Manager.

   The WSH project leaders and regional headquarters radio frequency focal
   points should submit RFA requests directly to the WSH Dissemination
   Systems Section. The WSH Radio Frequency Manager will provide
   assistance, as requested, in the preparation of RFA requests.

   All RFA requests will be examined for accuracy, proper justification,
   and necessary coordination before being processed through the DOC to
   the IRAC FAS for approval by the NTIA.

   The requestor will be provided an RFA (assuming approval) within 3
   months. The RFA will be provided to the NWS project leader and the
   associated regional headquarters radio frequency focal point for
   distribution and disposition. In special cases, the requestor can be
   notified verbally of approval/disapproval within 2 months after
   submission of the request.

   5.     Organizational Functions. The Telecommunications and
   Dissemination Branch of the Systems Integration Division, Office of
   Systems Operations, has responsibility for the overall management of
   NWS telecommunications programs. The Dissemination Systems Section of
   the Telecommunications and Dissemination Branch is tasked with the
   coordination and management of the radio frequency management program.
   The primary functional components within the NWS are the national and
   regional project leaders, the regional headquarters radio frequency
   focal points, and the WSH Radio Frequency Manager.

   5.1     Project Leaders. The national and regional project leaders are
   responsible for gathering all required radio parameter data and
   providing it to the national and regional headquarters radio frequency
   focal point. The data required, summarized in the simplified forms
   provided in the Appendix of this chapter, must be provided in
   accordance-with Chapter 9 of the NTIA Manual. While the simplified
   forms should assist the project leaders, it must be noted that the
   project leaders are responsible for all the information contained in
   the forms and for ensuring that the information is complete and
   complies with the NTTA Manual

   5.2     Regional Headquarters Radio Frequency Focal Point. The regional
   headquarters radio frequency focal point will coordinate with the
   regional project leaders, the radio frequency focal point in the
   adjacent region(s)/country as appropriate, and the WSH Radio Frequency
   Manager and will submit the necessary information in the prescribed
   format to the WSH Radio Frequency Manager.

   5.3     WSH Radio Frequency Manager. The WSH Radio Frequency Manager
   will ensure the accuracy of the information provided, check for
   compliance with requirements, and initiate the processing of the radio
   frequency request through the DOC/FAS/IRAC/NTIA. After the processing
   is complete, the WSH Radio Frequency Manager will inform appropriate
   personnel and subsequently provide them with an RFA as described
   earlier in this chapter.

                                  Appendix

                       RFA for NWS Radio Transmissions

   This appendix explains each data element code and provides 13
   simplified listings for individual programs for project leaders and
   regional headquarters radio frequency focal points to use when
   submitting RFA requests. The listings cover information required for
   the following types of radio stations:

     Automated Surface Observing System
     NOAA Data Buoy System
     GOES Satellite Data Collection Platform Stations
     Hydrologic Radio Stations
     NOAA Weather Radio
     NOAA Weather Radio Link
     Radar Link
     Radiosonde Down Link
     Radiosonde Up Link
     Wind Profiler
     WSR-57S Radar
     WSR-74C Radar
     WSR-88 D Rada r

   Asterisks identify those data fields that must be completed as
   described in Chapter 9 of the NTIA Manual. Those without asterisks are
   filled out with the obligatory or most common usage. All fields should
   be checked for accuracy by the requestor.

   The data element descriptions are provided for general explanatory
   purposes only. Any questions regarding the exact nature of the specific
   information or coding required in the abbreviated forms should be
   resolved by consulting Chapter 9 of the NTIA Manual.

   Requests for RFAs should cite the numerical limits of the specific
   frequencies (in Hertz) that are being requested. Letters or numbers
   shall not be used to designate specific bands of frequencies, e.g.,
   S-band, X-band, or Ku-band. Such designations create confusion because
   the band limits vary from one designator system or user group to
   another.

   The RFA request forms now in use within the NWS must contain the
   required information, but neither the form field names nor the field
   entries need to be changed at this time. In the future, when RFAs can
   be submitted electronically, submissions in the format described in
   this Appendix will be required.
