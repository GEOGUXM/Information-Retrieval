Services

   Your time is valuable. At the City of Houston we understand that. That
   is why we have worked to provide you with online services that give you
   the option of interacting with us from the comfort and convenience of
   your home or office.

   With a few keystrokes you can do everything from pay a ticket or a
   water bill, begin the process to obtain City licenses and permits, find
   information on Houston employment, check the library for a book or
   request more information from our 311 service.

   We are improving our services every day, both online and offline. We
   are using a combination of technology and first-hand experience
   continuously to find ways to serve you better. If you cannot find what
   you need here, contact the Citizens' Assistance Office for assistance.
