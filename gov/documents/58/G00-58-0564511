   Welcome to the USGS streamflow statistics web site!

      This site provides streamflow statistics and basin characteristics for
      most streams in Massachusetts. This information can be obtained through
      an interface (Java applet) that displays maps and allows you to select
      locations of interest to you. You can obtain streamflow statistics and
      basin characteristics from a database for more than 700 locations in
      the State where the USGS has collected streamflow data. You can also
      obtain this information for other locations by use of an automated
      procedure that measures characteristics of the land surface area
      (basin) that drains to the stream and inserts those characteristics
      into equations that estimate the streamflow statistics.

      The general public is invited to explore this scientific tool that was
      developed to provide information about the availability of water at a
      point on any stream in Massachusetts. This program, however, is an
      advanced internet application and requires some degree of understanding
      about the process that is being automated. Therefore, it is necessary
      to step through a tutorial that provides information about hardware and
      software requirements of the program and provides basic instructions
      and information necessary to use the application.  It is suggested that
      you print these materials to have as reference documents when you use
      the application.

      An on-line "demo"  is available to to familiarize yourself with this
      application. Click here if you would like to view it now.

      If you wish to use the application now, then click Let's Go!. You will
      be taken through a tutorial of 7 introductory screens that provide
      necessary information before you can start the applet.  Once you have
      completed the tutorial, bookmark the final application web page for
      future use!

      If you wish to read the documentation, you may select these following
      choices:
        * Water Resources Investigations Report
        * Fact Sheet

      This site was made possible through the cooperative efforts of the U.S.
      Geological Survey, MassGIS, the Massachusetts Department of
      Environmental Management, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
      Protection .  Web page construction and application development was
      done through a contract with Syncline, Inc.^1
