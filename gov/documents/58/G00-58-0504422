   ADCP
          (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler)
          [onebyone.gif] An instrument which generates a 3-dimensional
          current profile by analyzing the doppler-shift of
          fixed-frequency acoustic echos. See Jeffrey Gartner's Home Page
          for a diagram and explanation.
          [onebyone.gif] The instrument measures the Doppler-shifted,
          fixed-frequency echos backscattered from scatterers (plankton
          and sediment) in the water and converts the echos to
          north/south, east/west, and vertical velocity components.
          Velocity profiles are determined by range gating echos so that
          velocities are determined at pre-set intervals along the
          acoustic path (called bins). Velocity measurements with bin size
          as small as 5cm are possible with the Broad Band version of the
          ADCP operating in certain high resolution modes.

   Bathymetry
          [onebyone.gif] The underwater equivalent of topography.
          Bathymetry describes the spatial variations of water depth (ie
          locations and depths of undewater hills, plains, valleys etc).

   Datum
          [onebyone.gif] For marine applications, a base elevation used as
          a reference from which to reckon heights or depths. It is called
          a tidal datum when defined in terms of a certain phase of the
          tide. Tidal datums are local datums and should not be extended
          into areas which have differing hydrographic features without
          substantiating measurements. In order that they may be recovered
          when needed, such datums are referenced to fixed points known as
          bench marks.
          [onebyone.gif] A chart datum is the datum to which soundings on
          a chart are referred. It is usually taken to correspond to a
          low-water elevation (ie Mean Lower-Low Water).

          The datum used on this site is:

          + MLLW -- Mean Lower Low Water
            There are two low tides in each tidal cycle (so usually two
            low tides in each day). These two low tides are not quite the
            same height because one tide is generated by the gravitational
            interaction with the sun (which is small), and the other is
            generated by the gravitational interaction with the moon
            (which is not so small). Since the two low tides (or water
            levels) are different levels of low, one is naturally the
            higher low water (higher low tide) and the other is the lower
            low water (lower low tide). So Mean Lower Low Water is the
            average of the lower low water height of each tidal day (ie
            average of the lowest low tide from each day). The averages
            are taken over a period called the National Tidal Datum Epoch
            (a 19-year epoch).

          terms related to tides and currents consult the NOAA publication

   Knot
          [onebyone.gif] A speed of 1 nautical mile per hour (abbreviated
          kt). A speed of 1 nautical mph (1 knot) is equal to 1.15 mph or
          1.85 kph. This is commonly used in navigation and meteorology.

   Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW)
          [onebyone.gif] See Datum:MLLW above.

   Now-cast
          [onebyone.gif] Using computer modeling and simulations to
          extrapolate a complete, current set of data from a limited set
          of real-time data. The SF PORTS project combines real-time data
          from 5 current sensors in the bay with the TRIM model developed
          by Cheng and Casulli to produce a complete map of the current
          vector field in the SF Bay. The San Francisco Bay Area Wind Page
          is another shining example of nowcasting.

   PORTS
          [onebyone.gif] "The Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System is a
          program of the National Ocean Service that supports safe and
          cost-efficient navigation by providing ship masters and pilots
          with accurate real-time information required to avoid groundings
          and collisions." (taken from NOS PORTS page). A more detailed
          explanation is available at this site.

   TRIM
          Tidal, Residual, and Intertidal Mudflat Model.

     [onebyone.gif] "Trim also means simple and elegant, a goal that we
     are striving for."

          [onebyone.gif] The simulation code, or the "engine", was the
          contribultion of Vincenzo Casulli and his research team at the
          University of Trento, Italy. The hydrodynamic model solves the
          nonlinear, depth averaged shallow-water equations using a
          semi-implicit finite-difference scheme in conjunction with an
          Eulerian- Lagrangian mass-conservative treatment of the
          convective terms (See Casulli [1] for details).
          [onebyone.gif] Further enhancement of the model includes the
          treatment of Tidal, Residual, and Intertidal Mudflats. Thus the
          numerical model system is known as TRIM2D. The present version
          of the code has been improved by Casulli and Cattani using a
          Crank-Nicolson type of time integration which gives better
          numerical accuracy and computational efficiency [3].
          [onebyone.gif] TRIM2D has been applied to San Francisco Bay and
          it has been calibrated and validated against an extensive field
          data set by Cheng, Casulli and Gartner, ([2]).
