   Welcome to PIN Application

   The PIN Application is for students or parents who would like to
   receive a PIN and who aren't currently on file with a U.S. Department

   sure what your PIN is, you can use the PIN Application Form to receive
   your PIN electronically or to update your PIN mailing address. If your
   PIN has been Lost or Compromised, you may contact Customer Service at
   1-800-4-FED-AID (800-433-3243) / TTY: 800-730-8913 or 319-337-5665 or
   change your PIN using the option Change PIN.

   The PIN Application Process:
   Step 1: Enter personal information
   Step 2: Submit Your PIN Application information
   Step 3: Receive confirmation that we have received your application
