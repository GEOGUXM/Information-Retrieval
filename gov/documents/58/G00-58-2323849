Glazing Materials Research

   Chromogenics: Dynamic glazing materials, especially electrochromic
   electrodes are an active area of research for us. We also manage the
   DOE Electrochromics Initiative and support the industry participants in
   their efforts to produce electrochromic window products.

   Low-Emittance and Solar Control: Static spectral filters have achieved
   tremendous commercial success. There is still room for improvement in
   performance and other characteristics.

   Deposition Processes: The process of making coatings is important in
   itself for producing optimum properties as well as minimizing
   production costs and energy consumption. Plasma processes are a
   specialty.

   Characterization: The best materials characterization facilities in the
   world are available to guide the development of new materials. These
   facilites are not only used for our in-house research but they are also
   available to solve the problems of glazing manufacturers. Optical
   analysis is a specialty  for obvious reasons. We have a fully equiped
   optical laboratory for characterization of glazing materials. This
   facility is used not only for materials research, but also to support
   the NFRC product rating program and related standards activities. Our
   optical data library is the foundation of the NFRC product rating
   system. We have a separate site for information and planning of the
   Optical Properties Subcommittee of NFRC

   New Developments   We keep track of the latest research and development
   activities on glazing and windows throughout the world. International
   Energy Agency (IEA) tasks are one of our primary sources of
   information. Active tasks include IEA Task 27 Performance of Solar
   Facade Components and IEA Task 31 Daylighting Buildings in the 21st
   Century. Task 18 Advanced Glazing Materials and Task 21 Daylighting in
   Buildings are complete but there is still useful information in the
   archives.
