   The FEMCI Text is a composite created using a font called Colonna MT
   and the picture below. The picture is of the Great Lakes with Lake
   Michigan in the center. It was taken in June of 1991 aboard the Space
   Shuttle mission STS-40. If you would like more detailed information
   about the image, please click on it and you will be taken to the Earth
   From Space image site at http://earth.jsc.nasa.gov/.
   The Great Lakes, North America

   The Earth From Space has hundreds of images available to view and
   download. You can pick the location of the Earth you want to see and
   probably spend hours looking at what is offered.
