   Quantum Physics Division

   Eric Cornell and Carl E. Wieman share^* the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics


   About the Quantum Physics Division
   The Division, part of NIST's Physics Laboratory, participates in JILA,
   a cooperative enterprise between NIST and the University of Colorado
   (CU). The Division conducts long-term, cutting edge research in quantum
   physics and related areas in support of the Nation's science and
   technology.

                              Research Areas
    The Quantum Physics Division works on fundamental, highly accurate,
   measurements and theoretical analyses, using quantum physics, quantum
     optics, chemical physics, gravitational physics, and geophysical
                measurements. In particular, the Division:
   - develops the laser as a refined measurement tool;
   - determines fundamental constants and tests of the fundamental
                             postulates of physics;
   - exploits Bose-Einstein condensation for metrology and low temperature
                                    physics;
   - devises new ways to direct and control atoms and molecules;
   - characterizes chemical processes and their interactions with
                                 nanostructures

         NIST Physicist Wins Nobel Prize!
   Eric Cornell of NIST and Carl Wieman of the University of Colorado are
   winners of the 2001 Nobel Prize in physics along with Wolfgang Ketterle
      of MIT. They are recognized "for the achievement of Bose-Einstein
   condensation in dilute gases of alkali atoms, and for early fundamental
               studies of the properties of the condensates."
                      Rotating Bose-Einstein condensate
   Bose-Einstein condensates can be made to rotate about a central "vortex
     core" in which the condensate atoms are absent. In the top strip of
    pictures, the core is non-destructively observed to precess about the
   center of the condensate. The bottom strip illustrates a similar effect
      for condensates that have been released from their magnetic trap.
