                Research at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center

   The NASA/ASEE SFFP allows awardees to do research at Goddard Space
   Flight Center in Greenbelt-MD, at the Wallops Flight Facility on
   Wallops Island-VA, or at the Goddard Institute for Space Science in New
   York-NY. The most important part of the Summer Faculty Fellowship
   Program is the link formed between faculty and NASA scientists and
   engineers. The most important selection factor for awardees are the
   recommendations we get from GSFC, WFF and GISS technical and scientific
   staff. We strongly encourage applicants to use the links below and
   explore the full range of Goddard science and engineering.
   __________________________________________________________________

     * Earth Sciences - Conducts scientific studies in the Earth sciences
       leading to a better understanding of processes affecting global
       change and the distribution of natural resources through research,
       development and application of space technologies.

     * Space Sciences - Plans, organizes, directs, and evaluates a broad
       spectrum of scientific research both theoretical and experimental
       in the study of space phenomena. Provides scientific counsel to
       other directorates that are working on space science projects.

     * Systems Technology and Advanced Concepts - Provides end-to-end and
       life cycle systems engineering; supports advanced mission
       conceptualization and early development; leads the agency
       technology planning and commercialization activities; and infuses
       advanced technologies into all programs and projects.

     * Applied Engineering and Technology - Provides discipline expertise
       for science conceptualization, end-to-end mission development and
       space communications support. Develops advanced technology to meet
       current and future science needs.

     * Management Operations - Provides business and institutional support
       and services necessary for the successful accomplishment of the
       CenterÂ’s Earth science, space science, and technology management
       activities.

     * Office of Flight Assurance - Responsible for safety, reliability
       and quality assurance programs to ensure flight mission success.
       This includes the control of electronic parts, materials and
       processes. The directorate also is responsible for independent
       design reviews of technical and flight safety aspects of spacecraft
       and instruments.

     * Flight Projects - Plans, organizes, and directs the management of
       the Center's major flight projects, new start studies,
       international projects, and the small and medium class expendable
       launch vehicles.

     * Suborbital Projects and Operations - Responsible for the overall
       management, operation and support of NASA's sounding rocket and
       balloon programs and the conduct of aeronautical research. This
       function is located at the Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island,
       Virginia.
