Welcome to the U.S. Blue Pages

   If you want to connect to the services and initiatives your federal
   government or have a question that a federal agency can answer, you can
   look to us as your first source of information. Either on-line at
   www.usbluepages.gov or in many local phone books, the U.S. Blue Pages
   are your easy-to-use, federally funded directory linking you to a host
   of government agencies and federal services.

   The U.S. Blue Pages are organized functionally, so you can find the
   information you need fast. For example, if you're looking for tax
   forms, you can find the help you need under "T" for taxes or "I" for
   the Internal Revenue Service. You can also find agencies' internet
   addresses, toll-free numbers and special service numbers.

   And the information is FREE! Using the directories costs you nothing --
   no per-call costs, no information fees. More efficient listings save
   you time and money hunting for resources or calling the wrong number.

   Your U.S. Blue Pages are here to connect you to your federal government
   services or agencies. Get more information or send a question to our
   virtual help desk.
