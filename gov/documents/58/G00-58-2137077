Who we are

   The Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) was created independent of
   state administrative agencies and is responsible for impartial
   administration of administrative hearings. RCW 34.12.010. Since its
   inception in 1982, the agency has provided independent, professional,
   and timely due process hearings for a wide variety of state and local
   agencies. .

   OAH currently has 70 Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) in nine field
   offices (Everett, Olympia, Seattle, Spokane, Vancouver, and Yakima). It
   handles approximately 48,000 administrative cases per year. Last year
   OAH conducted hearings for a total of 25 state agencies and eight local
   governments. The greatest volume of cases are unemployment insurance
   cases for the Employment Security Department (25,000+ cases per year)
   and public assistance benefits and child support cases for the
   Department of Social and Health Services (20,000+ cases per year).

   In addition, OAH receives many cases from the Superintendent of Public
   Instruction (e.g., special education cases), Liquor Control Board
   (e.g., liquor licensing cases), Department of Licensing (e.g., business
   and professional licensing cases), and Department of Labor and
   Industries (e.g., contractor's licensing cases), and from numerous
   local governments and a variety of other state agencies. In FY 2000,
   OAH received cases from 24 state agencies and 6 local governments.

   Hearings range from one hour unemployment insurance cases, with largely
   pro se claimants and employers to multi-week special education hearings
   with multiple parties and multiple attorneys. Despite the heavy
   caseload and controversial nature of many cases, OAH continues to
   provide fair hearings to citizens challenging governmental actions.

   Washington was among the leading states in adopting a "central panel"
   system, creating OAH as an independent agency to conduct administrative
   hearings for other state agencies. This eliminates the troublesome
   appearance and awkwardness of having the same agency conduct a hearing
   to review its own decision.

   OAH has one program and one mission: to conduct fair and independent
   hearings followed by sound and timely decisions. The agency has
   deliberately adopted a short mission statement and dual goals of
   quality and timeliness in order to focus on what it does and does well.

   Among the services that OAH provides are:
     * Impartial and independent ALJs with expertise in both
       administrative and substantive law
     * Accessible and economical hearings by telephone or in person
     * Respectful, professional, and fair treatment of the parties
     * Hearings which are scheduled promptly and conducted efficiently
     * A fully developed hearing record
     * Researched and reasoned written decisions which are timely and
       understandable
