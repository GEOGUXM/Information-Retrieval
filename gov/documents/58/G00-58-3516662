                            Health Alert Network


   The threat of bioterrorism in the United States has increased in recent
   years.  New and persistent health threats that exceed the abilities of
   our existing, fragmented local and state public health infrastructures
   are becoming more common.  Our society has become very mobile, which
   means that a disease originating in one state may be transferred to
   many other states in a single day.  Without the needed information
   system in place, clusters of disease cases can go undiagnosed for weeks
   while contagion spreads silently.  A bioterrorism event, like other
   health threats, will be detected first at the local level.  Health
   facilities throughout Alaska and the lower 48 states must have the
   capacity to detect and respond to these threats.  The essential
   capabilities that need to be in place for an effective Public Health
   response to a health threat are:
     * ongoing surveillance activities to quickly identify potential
       health threats
     * laboratory capability to perform testing to determine the threat
       agent
     * the ability to conduct disease investigations

   The Health Alert Network is a nationwide system for:
     * Communications and information access
     * Workforce development
     * Organizational development

   ...designed to support the public health response to bioterrorism and
   other health threats.  Follow the links below to find out more
   information about Alaska's Health Alert Network.
