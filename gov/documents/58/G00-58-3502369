                    ANIMAL BRAINS AS THE MODEL FOR HUMANS


     The Brookhaven-led studies of GVG, or gamma vinyl-GABA, involved
     research on the brains of both primates and rodents as stand-ins for
     the human brain, using ten different biochemical and behavioral
     techniques.

     The team's first publication in 1992 demonstrated that GVG inhibited
     brain dopamine in rodents, as well as the biochemical effects of
     cocaine in the region of the brain that is thought to play the most
     important role in addiction. These studies served as the impetus to
     pursue GVG further in primates, and to look at its role in
     cocaine-related behavior.

     The primate studies reported for cocaine and nicotine used a
     sophisticated medical imaging technique called PET, for positron
     emission tomography. PET scans are made using a large donut-shaped
     "camera," which records faint signals from short-lived radioactive
     isotopes injected into the body. PET is used in hospitals and
     scientific institutions throughout the world for research and
     diagnosis. BNL researchers have used PET scans for decades to study
     the brain, and have made many discoveries pertaining to addiction,
     aging, mental illness and normal brain function.

     For the nicotine and cocaine studies in Synapse, the researchers
     looked at the brain scans of primates before and after they had
     taken nicotine or cocaine. The primates that had been given a dose
     of GVG before their nicotine or cocaine dose showed normal levels of
     dopamine in the brain, compared with those that had not gotten GVG.
     The primates are part of a resident group housed at BNL in
     facilities accredited by the Association for the Assessment and
     Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).

     Other methods used to evaluate GVG's effects involved rodents. For
     example, researchers at St. John's University and Boston University
     gave rats nicotine or cocaine repeatedly in order to examine their
     behavior when they received GVG. They also looked at the rats'
     tendency to return to a place where they had gotten nicotine or
     cocaine previously.

     Called conditioned place preference, or CPP, this behavior is also
     important in human nicotine and cocaine addiction. Recovering
     addicts often fall back into addiction if they are exposed to
     stimuli that they associate with their former use of the drug; for
     example, drug paraphernalia or an alley or house where they
     routinely bought or used drugs.

     BIOCHEMICAL STUDIES

     1. Direct measurement of brain dopamine levels (Microdialysis)

     2. Medical imaging of brain dopamine receptor activity (Positron
     emission tomography)

     3. Metabolism and drug-delivery studies (Positron emission
     tomography) cocaine study only

     4. Effect of cocaine-GVG combination on heart function (synergistic
     drug-drug interaction) cocaine study only

     BEHAVIORAL STUDIES

     5. Bar-pressing for cocaine, same number of presses each time
     (Fixed-ratio cocaine self-administration) cocaine study only

     6. Bar-pressing for cocaine, increasing number of presses each time
     (Progressive-ratio cocaine self-administration) cocaine study only

     7. Bar-pressing for repeated good feeling (Brain stimulation reward
     threshold) cocaine study only

     8. Blocking a learned response (Conditioned place preference
     expression) cocaine study only

     9. Blocking the learning of a response (Conditioned place preference
     acquisition)

     10. Measurement of ability to move (Locomotor tests)

     All studies were sanctioned by BNL's Institutional Animal Care and
     Use Committee, and by corresponding committees at the collaborating
     institutions.
