   TOPAZ is a software system for automated analysis of landscape
   topography from digital elevation models. The primary objective of
   TOPAZ is the rapid and systematic identification and quantification of
   topograhic features in support of investigations related to
   land-surface processes, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, assessment
   of land resources, and management of watersheds and ecosystems. Typical
   examples of topographic features that are evaluated by TOPAZ include
   terrain slope and aspect, drainage patterns and divides, channel
   network, watershed segmentation, subcatchment identification, geometric
   and topologic properties of channel links, drainage distances,
   representative subcatchment properties, and channel network analysis.
