   BIKE RACKS

MetroCenter More Bike Friendly

   At the request of MTC, the city of Oakland has just installed five
   U-shaped bike racks on the sidewalk in front of the Joseph P. Bort
   MetroCenter, MTC's headquarters and the venue for most of MTC's
   meetings. Located at 101 Eighth Street in Oakland, the MetroCenter is
   adjacent to the Lake Merritt BART station.

   Each bike rack can accommodate two bicycles; riders must bring their
   own locks. Oakland has successfully installed over 1,000 bike racks in
   business districts throughout the city.

   For more information, contact MTC planner Trent Lethco,
   tlethco@mtc.ca.gov.
