   Nuclear Materials

   Regulated Materials

        * Special nuclear material - consists of uranium-233 or uranium-235,
          enriched uranium, or plutonium
        * Source material - natural uranium or thorium, or depleted uranium
          that is not suitable for use as reactor fuel
        * Byproduct material - generally, nuclear material (other than
          special nuclear material) that is produced or made radioactive in a
          nuclear reactor. Also the tailings and waste produced by extraction
          or concentration of uranium or thorium from an ore processed
          primarily for its source material content.

      NRC does not regulate all nuclear material. See Who Regulates
      Radioactive Materials and Radiation Exposure for details.

   Regulated Activities

      For general information, see the How We Regulate page. For details, see
      the following:
        * Medical, industrial, and academic uses of nuclear material
        * Fuel cycle facilities
        * Source material facilities
        * Materials transportation
        * Materials decommissioning

   Responsibilities

      The Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards has overall
      responsibility for NRC's materials program and NRC's Regional Offices
      (Region I - Northeast, Region II - Southeast, Region III - Midwest, and
      Region IV - West/Southwest) implement these programs in the states for
      which they are responsible. Materials regulation is also supported by a
      Nuclear Materials Research program and by independent advice from the
      Advisory Committee on Medical Uses of Isotopes.

      Of the over 20,000 medical, industrial, and academic uses of nuclear
      materials licenses in place in the United States. About a quarter are
      administered by NRC; the rest are administered by the 32 Agreement
      states.  All other nuclear materials licenses are administered by the
      NRC.
