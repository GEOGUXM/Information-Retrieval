                      Most Recent Update: 24 June 2001.
                              Technical notes:
         (1) This is the first release of the 1966 - 2000 analysis.
    (2) The BBS database has undergone extensive revisions in 1998-2000,
   and many of the changes will be reflected in the results. Please let us
                   know about any problems you encounter!
      (3) Some 1966 - 1996 analyses (e.g., distribution maps) have been
   retained here, but most of the trend results from earlier analyses have
                           been moved to archives.
    (4) Some species are grouped for analysis. These are indicated on the
                              selection lists.
      (5) Earlier versions of the web site have been archived, and are
                            accessible via links.
    (6) A credibility index has been added to trend results. This symbol
   flags imprecise, small sample size, or otherwise questionable results.
   (7) Most recent update: 24 June 2001. Analysis was rerun is reponse to
   referee questions and comments. Sample sizes were slightly reduced, as
           nonrandom routes were eliminated in the final analysis.

Survey Results

   Species Groups: Analysis of Change for Species Groups
   Summary information on population change by region and time period
   Interactive Species Trend and Indices Program
   This program allows you to display trends for 3 time intervals, by
   species. Indices are provided as links from the species names
   Interactive Regional Trend and Indices Program
   This program allows you to display trends for 3 time intervals, by
   region. Indices are provided as links from the region names
   Link to additional summaries of 1966 - 1999 data
   Link to additional summaries of the 1999 data, including additional
   time periods, and summaries excluding recent years.
   Abundance Maps-Spatial Patterns of Bird Abundance
   These are relative abundance maps, estimated over the interval
   1982-1996.
   Trend Maps-Spatial Patterns of Bird Population Change
   These are maps of population change, based on the 1966-1996 interval.
   Alaska relative abundance maps
   These maps, based on BBS data in Alaska, are very rough. We will update
   them occasionally.

Interactive Checklists

   Relative abundance maps
   This program allows you to estimate mean abundance from BBS data for
   any species, at any location in the survey area. (This now includes
   Alaska!)

Analytical Tools

   Interactive Route Data Summary
   This program provides access to all information, for any species, on
   any BBS route.
   Interactive Route-regression Trend Analysis
   This program allows you to estimate population change for any species
   and time interval (1966 - 2000), in any region covered by the BBS
   Program Comdyn
   This program is for estimation of species richness from BBS data using
   capture-recapture based estimation procedures.
