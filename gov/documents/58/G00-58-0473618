                                 Background

     The Salton Sea Authority is a joint powers agency chartered by the
   State of California by a Joint Powers Agreement on June 2, 1993 for the
         purpose of ensuring the beneficial uses of the Salton Sea.

    The Authority is comprised of the following cooperating agencies: The
     Coachella Valley Water District, The Imperial Irrigation District,
   Riverside County, and Imperial County. A number of federal, state, and
          tribal agencies are ex-officio members of the Authority.

      The Authority was formed to work with California state agencies,
    federal agencies, and the Republic of Mexico to develop programs that
     would continue beneficial use of the Salton Sea.  In the agreement,
        "beneficial use" includes the primary purpose of the Sea as a
   depository for agricultural drainage, storm water and wastewater flows;
   for protection of endangered species, fisheries and waterfowl; and for
                           recreational purposes.

   A Technical Advisory Committee, composed of an individual from each of
   the four member agencies, provides technical and administrative advice
     and support to both the Board of Directors and the Authority staff.
     The Salton Sea Authority has made a concerted effort to collect all
    known suggestions for remediation of the Salton Sea and has subjected
      these proposals to formal review against specified criteria. The
    Authority also is taking concrete steps in preparing for the detailed
                     planning of a remediation project.
