   This "raw" graph represents the weighted average values of standard
   deviation, of the layer mean virtual temperatures (500 - 700 mb),
   derived from approximately 100,000 Radiosonde/Retrieval collocations
   per year. Each point on the graph represents a global average standard
   deviation of 1100 Clear and Cloud Cleared (N^*) collocations or 800
   Cloudy collocations, for the selected layer each week. The data plotted
   on the graph are for all NOAA satellites for which TOVS was providing
   the operational soundings:

     Morning (NOAA-10 1/87-9/91 and NOAA-12 9/91-present)

     Afternoon (NOAA-11 1/89-3/95 and NOAA-14 6/95-present)

   This graph displays a seasonal trend (even though the statistics are
   global) because the distribution of the Radiosonde stations is
   primarily in the northern hemisphere. Even though a seasonal trend is
   observed for both Clear (and N^*) and Cloudy soundings the seasonal
   variation of the standard deviation has decreases 0.3 degress K and 0.6
   degrees K respectively.
