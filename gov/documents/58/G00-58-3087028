     The ridges, meadows, and deep canyons of Henry W. Coe State Park are
     located in the Diablo Range south of San Jose and east of the fertile
     Santa Clara Valley.  Elevations in the 80,000-acre park range from 710
     feet where the North Fork of Pacheco Creek leaves the southeastern part
     of the park to 3,560 feet on the slopes of Mt. Stakes in the
     northeastern area of the park.

     Gently rounded ridge tops alternate with deep, steep-sided canyons and
     beautiful flowing streams.  Grasslands and oak savanna straddle the
     ridges and cover the gentle slopes.  Shaded hillsides and canyons are
     covered with forests and woodlands.

     The ridges have spectacular views of the surrounding countryside, and
     from some vantage points, on clear days, you can see the peaks and
     domes of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

     When you come to the park, don't forget to bring a camera.
     The opportunities for excellent nature photography are limitless.
