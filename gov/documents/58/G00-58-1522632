   The Mathematical Research Branch offers recent doctoral recipients the
   opportunity to carry out interdiscplinary research in theoretical
   biology in close collaboration with experimentalists. Current foci
   include computational neuroscience on both the systems and cellular
   level, calcium handling and oscillations in pituitary gonadotrophs and
   pancreatic beta-cells, and renal physiology. NIH postdoctoral
   fellowships support two or three years of intensive research without
   teaching or grant writing obligations. Backgrounds in mathematics,
   physics, computer science, engineering, chemistry, and other
   quantitative sciences are appropriate. The principle requirement is a
   demonstrated talent and interest in applying mathematics to solve
   important problems in biology.

   NIH is an equal opportunity employer. Women and minorities are
   encouraged to apply. Both U. S. and non-U. S. citizens are eligible.
   Applicants should have received a Ph. D. degree within the last five
   years.
