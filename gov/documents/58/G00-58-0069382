                         WRF WORKING GROUP HOME PAGE

     There are currently five development teams for the WRF system
     (Numerics and Software, Data Assimilation, Analysis and Validation,
     Community Involvement, and Operational Implementation), each of
     which coordinates efforts from the working groups in a general area
     of the WRF development process (the columns of the following table).

     An email alias has been set up for the WRF Team Leaders. To contact
     the WRF Team Leaders, send email to tlead@wrf-model.org.

     There are currently fifteen working groups for the WRF system, each
     of which concentrates on a particular aspect of the WRF development
     process (as is briefly listed below). Each of the working groups
     maintains a web page , which is accessed by selecting one of the
     working group names in the following table.
