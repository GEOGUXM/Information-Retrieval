   The FEB has two full time staff positions which are funded by the
   Department of the Navy. The executive director serves as the principal
   staff assistant to the FEB chairman and provides him with a full range
   of staff services. The FEB assistant serves as a personal assistant to
   the executive director and plays an important role in carrying out the
   day to day administration of the office.

   Security Administration

   The officers of the FEB serve for a one-year term and are elected by
   the FEB membership. Their term of office coincides with the fiscal
   year. An effort is made to alternate the chair between military and
   civilian personnel. Under normal conditions, the vice chair will be
   nominated to be the chair-elect.
