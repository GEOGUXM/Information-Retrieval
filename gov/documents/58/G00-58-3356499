Luminosities and
Energies Table

   *
   * Gabriele Garzoglio has complied a table of average instantaneous and
   integrated luminsoties, center of mass energy and energy spread for the
   beam for all physics run numbers. Missing data (0.0) is due to missing
   ACNET information.

   The Overall Table has 9 columns as described below. It is available a
   only numerical version of the same Overall Table (useful for paw).
   Here is also a link to the old table (Sep/Oct 1997) and to his only
   numerical version .
     Stack Number
     Resonance name (same as start of gold file directory names)
     Start date for taking data at point
     Run Number
     Nominal Energy as reported by online calculation [MeV]
     Offline Integrated Luminosity [nb^-1]
     Offline Average Instantaneous Luminosity [10^31 cm^-2 s^-1]
     Offline Average Center of Mass Energy [MeV]
     Offline Average Sigma of Energy Distribution [MeV]
