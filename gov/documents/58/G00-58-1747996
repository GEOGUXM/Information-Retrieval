Census Data


   The files presented here are based on footer image. U.S. Census Bureau
   Tiger files. The eight counties that surround Lake Tahoe are divided
   into a numerous footer image. Census tracts that include from 2,500 to
   8,000 people. They were taken for the footer image. SEDAC web site for
   Census Data download called footer image. DDCarto. They were imported
   into ARC/INFO, combined to cover the Lake Tahoe area, projected into
   UTM zone 10 NAD27 and converted to Shape and SDTS file formats.

   The original boundary files are available from the U.S. Census Bureau
   at footer image. http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/tr.html.

   The following Census data have been mosaicked together from the 18
   7.5-minute quadrangles that cover the Lake Tahoe Basin. The mosaicked
   files are more convenient for looking at areas throughout the basin or
   areas on the edge of two quadrangles.

   Census data are in UTM NAD27 zone 10 projection. Raw (original) data
   are in the following projections: data east of 120 degrees longitude
   are in UTM zone 11 and data west of 120 degrees longitude are in UTM
   zone 10. It is not possible to combine different projections in
   Geographic Information System (GIS), therefore, all data have been
   reprojected into one standard projection, UTM NAD27 zone 10 projection,
   for the Lake Tahoe Basin.
