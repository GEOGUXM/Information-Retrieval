   Description of research projects:

   The goal of our laboratory is to develop effective and economical
   methods for successful monitoring and/or control of key insect pests of
   tree fruit that will ultimately result in a reduction of or a
   replacement for conventional insecticides in orchard ecosystems. Our
   studies focus mainly on behavioral and chemical ecology of these pests.
   Currently we are involved in two major projects.

   One project focuses on plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar (Herbst)
   (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a key pest of apple in the eastern United
   States and Canada and a destructive pest of plum and peach in the
   southern United States. Currently, there is no effective method to
   monitor movements of plum curculio from overwintering sites to border
   rows of orchards where plum curculios enter and begin to damage fruit
   each spring. Some of our studies currently being conducted in 2001 are
   listed below.
     * Impact of natural sources of host fruit odor on plum curculio
       perception of synthetic fruit volatiles and pheromone
     * Effectiveness of currently available monitoring traps and lures for
       monitoring plum curculio movement and activity
     * Potential improvements to current monitoring traps
     * Reproductive potential and olfactory capabilities of the summer
       generation of the so-called "southern strain" plum curculio

   Our second project is in collaboration with Dr. Chris Bergh, Asst.
   Professor of Entomology at VPI&SU . This project focuses on the dogwood
   borer, Synthedon scitula Harris, an indirect pest of apple with an
   increasingly important economic impact due to widespread planting of
   apple trees on size-controlling rootstocks; these plantings promote the
   formation of adventititous root initials (burrknots) near the graft
   union. We will be conducting both laboratory and field experiments to
   determine if these burrknot tissues may be providing olfactory cues
   used by female dogwood borers to locate suitable oviposition sites
   and/or stimulate egg laying.
