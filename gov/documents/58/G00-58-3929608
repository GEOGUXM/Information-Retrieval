                       Life Sciences Division Overview

   The mission of the Life Sciences (LS) Division at Los Alamos National
   Laboratory (LANL) is to serve the nations needs in health, energy, and
   national security by addressing a broad range of biological problems at
   the molecular, cellular, physiological, and whole-organism levels. The
   division develops and uses the most advanced biological technologies
   and, whenever appropriate, exploits unique resources in the physical,
   chemical, and theoretical sciences found throughout Los Alamos National
   Laboratory.

   The Life Sciences Division and the Center for Human Genome Studies
   (CHGS) share a unifying theme based on our understanding of biological
   organization: sequence  structure  function. We are involved in and
   committed to the development of the tools and technologies necessary to
   bring understanding to this paradigm. Examples of how we are developing
   an understanding of sequence, structure, and function are found
   throughout this report and include programs in sequencing, clone
   selection, biological informatics, innovative cytometry, structure of
   DNA damage and repair proteins, cellular repair, and gene function in
   transgenic mice. These projects are establishing the fundamental basis
   for understanding living systems in the 21st century.

   The environment in which this work is conducted is somewhat unique.
   Complementary to our strategic plan, which calls for maintaining a
   strong, innovative core effort in cell and molecular biology, genomics,
   and structural biology, we rely heavily on multidisciplinary teams both
   within the Division and from across the Laboratory to solve critical
   problems in the biosciences. The creation of teams coupled with
   interdisciplinary participation with core expertise creates a highly
   productive environment in which to investigate interesting and
   substantive problems in the biosciences.

   As one of the eight core technical competencies at the Laboratory we
   actively support the Laboratory missions of environmental stewardship
   and nonproliferation and counter proliferation of weapons of mass
   destruction. Other elements of the Laboratory missions to which we
   contribute support defense, civilian, and industrial needs.
   Organizational values include individual initiative, responsiveness to
   our sponsors, creation of a diverse and creative workforce, and the
   maintenance of a safe working environment.

   Life Sciences Division consists of six technical groups (separate
   descriptions follow) and two support organizations under the leadership
   of L. Scott Cram, Acting Division Director. The six technical
   organizations and respective group leaders are: Genomics, Larry Deaven;
   Cell & Molecular Biology, Bruce Lehnert; Cytometry, Babetta Marrone;
   DNA Damage & Repair, David Chen; Environmental Molecular Biology, Paul
   Jackson; and Structural Biology, Thomas Terwilliger. These six
   organizations are responsible for approximately 85 projects. Support of
   the Divisions projects is largely from the Department of Energys
   (DOE) Office of Biological and Environmental Research (OBER).

   Significant portions are also derived from the National Institutes of
   Health (NIH), the DOEs Office of Nonproliferation and National
   Security (NN), and the Department of Defense (DoD). Laboratory Directed
   Research and Development (LDRD) funds are also used to support new
   initiatives. Projects funded by all these sources are included in this
   report because they are integrated into the Divisions strategic plan
   and serve to strengthen and complement the core OHER effort.

   Julie Wilson is Facility Manager for the research facilities supporting
   both LS Division and the Center for Human Genome Studies. The Facility
   Manager provides the architectural framework for facilities operation
   and environment, safety, and health (ES&H) oversight. Gary Strniste is
   Chief of Staff and Fawn Gore leads the Business Unit that provides
   administrative support for all Division personnel.
