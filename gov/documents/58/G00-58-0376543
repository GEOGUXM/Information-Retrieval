     Chandra takes in bright lights, big city of Milky Way

     NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has made a stunning, high-energy
     panorama of the central regions of our Milky Way galaxy. The
     findings are an important step toward understanding the most active
     area of the Milky Way as well as other galaxies throughout the
     universe.

     Like a sprawling megalopolis, the new Chandra images show hundreds
     of white dwarf stars, neutron stars and black holes bathed in an
     incandescent fog of multimillion-degree gas around a supermassive
     black hole.

     "The center of the galaxy is where the action is," said Q. Daniel
     Wang of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. "With these
     images, we get a new perspective of the interplay between stars, gas
     and dust, as well as the magnetic fields and gravity in the region.
     We can see how such forces affect the immediate vicinity and may
     influence other aspects of the galaxy."

     Wang presented the montage of 30 separate Chandra images today at
     the American Astronomical Society meeting in Washington, and in a
     paper published in the Jan. 10, 2002, issue of the journal Nature.
     The images, made with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS)
     July 16-21, 2001, covered a 400- by 900-light-year swath of the
     center of the galaxy.

     One immediate result was that the team could separate out the
     individual X-ray sources from the diffuse glow produced by hot gas.
     "We can now see that the sources are responsible for most of the
     X-rays from highly ionized iron previously attributed to the diffuse
     glow," said Eric Gotthelf, of Columbia University in New York, a
     co-author. "So we must now revise our notion of the hot gas, which
     appears to be about 10 times cooler than previously thought. It's
     only a relatively mild 10 million degrees!"

     The diffuse X-ray emission seems to be related to the turmoil and
     density of matter in the inner Milky Way. Stars are forming there at
     a much more rapid rate than in the galactic "suburbs." Many of the
     most massive stars in the galaxy are located in the galactic center
     and are furiously boiling off their outer layers in searing stellar
     winds. Supernova explosions are far more common in the region and
     send shock waves booming through the inner galaxy.

     And then there is the three-million-solar-mass black hole at the
     epicenter. Although Chandra recently observed a small flare from the
     vicinity of the central supermassive black hole, the power output
     near the black hole remains relatively low.

     However, an unexplained fluorescence of iron atoms, observed by the
     team to be associated with molecular clouds a few hundred
     light-years away, may indicate that the supermassive black hole was
     hundreds of times brighter in the past. Alternatively, the
     fluorescence could be due to high-energy particles called cosmic
     rays produced by supernovae or bygone eruptions from the
     supermassive black hole.

     "The galactic center is dominated by very high pressures due to the
     hot gas component and the strong magnetic fields," said Cordelia
     Lang, also of the University of Massachusetts, and a co-author.
     "It's a nice place to visit with a telescope but I wouldn't want to
     live there.

     "The Chandra map shows that the high-pressure and high-temperature
     gas is apparently escaping from the center into the halo of the
     galaxy. "A galaxy is a sort of ecosystem, and the activity in the
     center can seriously affect the evolution of the galaxy as a whole,"
     said Wang. "Astronomically, the center of the Milky Way is really in
     our backyard, and, therefore, provides an excellent laboratory to
     learn about the cores of other galaxies."

     The ACIS instrument was developed for NASA by Pennsylvania State
     University, University Park, and Massachusetts Institute of
     Technology, Cambridge. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in
     Huntsville, Ala., manages the Chandra program, and TRW, Inc.,
     Redondo Beach, Calif., is the prime contractor. The Smithsonian's
     Chandra X-ray Center controls science and flight operations from
     Cambridge, Mass.
