                                      Benefits Home

      Implementation of the Commercial Vehicle Information Systems and
   Networks (CVISN) program will result in enhanced safety for drivers and
   trucks and improved operating efficiencies for government agencies and
   motor carriers. In turn both the public and private sector participants
   will realize savings in time, resources and the cost of doing business.
                            The benefits include:

                                   Safety
     * Reduced congestion at weigh stations will mean shorter lines of
       trucks backed up.
     * Law enforcement will be able to concentrate its efforts on
       high-risk and uninspected carriers and operators.
     * Fewer trucks pulling in and out of weigh stations reduces accident
       risk for commercial and passenger vehicles.

                                 Simplicity
     * Simplified, automated screening and targeting of high-risk
       operators improves enforcement efficiency.
     * Standardized data exchange makes for a simpler, more efficient
       workday for motor carriers, drivers, and regulators alike.
     * Low risk carriers, vehicles and drivers face fewer and simpler
       roadside inspections.
     * Applications can be easily filed from the motor carrier's
       administrative offices.
     * Motor carriers can get better information quicker from regulatory
       and enforcement agencies.

                                   Savings
     * Electronic screening will eliminate the need truckers to stop for
       unnecessary weight and safety inspection.
     * Automated reporting and record keeping technology will reduce
       costly paperwork for government and motor carriers
     * Motor carriers no longer have to go in person to file applications
       at each of the agencies that regulate the company's business.
     * Government agencies will be able to process license and certificate
       applications more quickly and accurately.
     * Electronic screening will reduce the number of stops and starts
       commercial vehicles must make, thus reducing fuel consumption and
       time idling in lines at weigh stations
     * As vehicles keep moving, the flow of goods from manufacturer to
       distributor to consumer is streamlined and on time deliveries will
       improve.
     * The new technologies are cheaper to install and use than
       constructing new weigh stations. They also improve the efficiency
       of existing facilities.
     * Existing highway infrastructure and facilities can be used more
       effectively.
     * In an era of shrinking budgets, electronic screening technologies
       allow government agencies to shift personnel and resources from
       processing paperwork to other tasks.
     * States will be able to more effectively collect taxes and other
       revenues.
