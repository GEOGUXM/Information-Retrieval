              Have Your Savings Bonds Stopped Earning Interest?

   It's important to periodically check your bonds to make sure that
   they're still earning interest. This is especially true for Series E
   bonds and savings notes since (unlike the H and HH series) you don't
   receive regular interest payments from Treasury. The table below will
   help you determine if your bonds have stopped earning interest.

   The following savings bonds no longer earn interest:


                  SERIES                     ISSUE DATE
                    E               May 1941 through January 1962
                                                  and
                                 December 1965 through January 1972
                    H              June 1952 through January 1972
                    HH            January 1980 through January 1982
              Savings Notes         May 1967 through October 1970
          A, B, C, D, F, G, J, K             All issues

   If your bonds have stopped earning interest, you should cash them in or
   exchange them.

   In general, savings bonds earn interest for different lengths of time
   depending on the series of the bond and, in some cases, when the bond
   was issued. Use the table below to determine how long your bonds will
   earn interest.
