   Electric Power Regulation

           The Commission approves rates for wholesale electric sales of
          electricity and transmission in interstate commerce for private
           utilities, power marketers, power pools, power exchanges and
         independent system operators. The Commission acts under the legal
       authority of the Federal Power Act (FPA) of 1935, the Public Utility
      Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), and the Energy Policy Act (EPAct). The
      Commission oversees the issuance of certain stock and debt securities,
      assumption of obligations and liabilities, and mergers. The Commission
         reviews the holding of officer and director positions between top
       officials in utilities and certain other firms they do business with.
          Finally, the Commission reviews rates set by the federal power
      marketing administrations, such as the Bonneville Power Administration,
          confers exempt wholesale generator status under the EPAct, and
           certifies qualifying small power production and cogeneration
                                    facilities.
