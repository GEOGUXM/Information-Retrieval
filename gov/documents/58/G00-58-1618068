   Western 2000

   Western Area Power Administration markets and delivers reliable,
   cost-based hydroelectric power and related services within a 15-state
   region of the central and western U.S. We're one of four power
   marketing administrations within the U.S. Department of Energy whose
   role is to market and transmit electricity from multi-use water
   projects. Our transmission system carries electricity from 55
   hydropower plants operated by the Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Army
   Corps of Engineers and the International Boundary and Water Commission.
   Together, these plants have a capacity of 10,600 megawatts.

   Western and its energy-producing partners are separately managed and
   financed. In addition, each water project maintains a separate
   financial system and records.

   Western's administrator and staff focus on sound business practices and
   cost containment.

   For more information about Western and our activities, see our Fact
   sheets and Media Center.
