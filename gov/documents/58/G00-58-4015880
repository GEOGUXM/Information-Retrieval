      Behind the curtain

      By Jay Levine

      Behind the daunting appearance, thick clouds of smoke, flashing lights
      and thunderous voice of the Wizard of Oz was a person hidden by a
      curtain in a control room who coordinated the effects.

      And one of the people behind the "curtain" of the flight research
      control room is Mae Yook Wong, a member of Dryden's Test Information
      Engineers (TIE) Group within the Western Aeronautical Test Range
      (WATR).

      She's not the big bellowing voice of Oz, but she coordinates behind the
      scenes so when a project like the Autonomous Formation Flight (AFF)
      comes into the control room for a research mission, the stage is set
      for a success.

      Long before flight day, Wong attended the earliest meetings on the AFF
      Research Program.

      "I look to understand where the program is heading and what's important
      to have for a successful research project," she explained.

      Researchers from many research disciplines often have special
      requirements for the control room, explained Wong. She gathers these
      requirements for control room displays, real-time data and post flight
      data processing.

      "We need to know what they want on the displays - what they need to
      see. For example, the AFF Project required a safety parameter to
      monitor the distance from the tail of the lead aircraft to the nose of
      the trailing aircraft. If the parameter falls below the safety range,
      then the information on the display will turn red," Wong said.

      The displays also monitor the progress in accomplishing a test point
      and how long the aircraft is in the test point. For example, created
      displays show the position of the trail aircraft flying in the vortex
      of the lead aircraft relative to the expected test position. The vortex
      is a stream of air that comes off the wingtip in a swirling motion.

      The pilot toggles a trigger for the duration of the test point.
      Researchers in the control room can tell on the display how long the
      pilot has been in a test point and get estimated fuel flow averages at
      the end of the test point for the trailing aircraft. The control room
      researchers also can see stick movements and control surface
      deflections of the trail aircraft.

      In another example of special control room requirements, the Propulsion
      and Performance Branch provided FORTRAN code for a model that shows the
      thrust of the trailing aircraft in real time, or as it is happening,
      during a research flight. Ron Ray, senior research engineer in the
      Propulsion and Performance Branch, said the tools used to create the
      program were first used during X-29 testing and show researchers if a
      test point was effective.

      One method to create displays is through a system called the Parameter
      Display System (PDS). The system allows for the creation of a
      time-history that plots how information changes during a period of time
      and allows data to be displayed as numeric values. Another method to
      create displays is by programming and creating a display called the
      Project Application Graphic Executable (PAGE).
