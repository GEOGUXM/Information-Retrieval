                                  Hualalai
                       Hawai`i's Third Active Volcano

   Hualalai is the third youngest and third-most historically active
   volcano on the Island of Hawai`i. Six different vents erupted lava
   between the late 1700s and 1801, two of which generated lava flows that
   poured into the sea on the west coast of the island. The Keahole
   Airport, located only 11 km north of Kailua-Kona, is built atop the
   larger flow.

   Though Hualalai is not nearly as active as Mauna Loa or Kilauea, our
   recent geologic mapping of the volcano shows that 80 percent of
   Hualalai's surface has been covered by lava flows in the past 5,000
   years. In the past few decades, when most of the resorts, homes, and
   commercial buildings were built on the flanks of Hualalai, earthquake
   activity beneath the volcano has been low. In 1929, however, an intense
   swarm of earthquakes lasting more than a month was most likely caused
   by magma rising to near the surface. For these reasons, Hualalai is
   considered a potentially dangerous volcano that is likely to erupt
   again in the next 100 years.
