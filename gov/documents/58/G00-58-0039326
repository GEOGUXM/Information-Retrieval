      This page is devoted to notable hurricanes and tropical storms of 2000.
          NCDC archives the climatic data, satellite images, and radar data
          related to these storms. A good deal of the surface data collected
          by National Weather Service offices and other airports, as well as
          cooperative stations, is available via the NCDC Get/View Data page.
          NCDC also has images and movies of these events-- Historical
          Significant Imagery, along with special reports and summaries that
          put these and other global climate events in historical
          perspective-- Worldwide Weather Events--2000. Finally, NCDC reports
          on the global climate and places monthly temperatures,
          precipitation and extremes in historical perspective-- The Climate
          of 2000.

    Hurricane Logbook - Interesting Facts and Climatology- August 2000
       Alberto, as of 11AM EDT on the August 17th, maintained at least
       tropical storm strength longer than any other Atlantic August
       tropical cyclone since 1900 except for Hurricane Felix in 1995.
       Alberto maintain storm status until August 23rd at 1500Z. and
       surpassed Felix for August longevity. Alberto became the first
       Tropical Storm in the Atlantic basin on August 4th, 2000 at 11AM
       AST. Alberto was upgraded to a Hurricane again for the third time
       on the 18th.
       The record for longevity belongs to Hurricane/Typhoon John which
       lasted 31 days as it traveled both the Northeast and Northwest
       Pacific basins during August and September 1994. (It formed in the
       Northeast Pacific, reached hurricane force there, moved across the
       dateline and was renamed Typhoon John, and then finally recurved
       back across the dateline and renamed Hurricane John again.)
       Hurricane Ginger was a tropical cyclone for 28 days in the North
       Atlantic Ocean back in 1971. For more fascinating information on
       the subject see NOAA/AOML Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
       Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Tropical Cyclones.
       Tropical Storm Beryl made landfall 150 miles south of Brownsville,
       Texas on the 14th. Moisture from Beryl moved northward along the
       south Texas coast and brought 0.79 inches of rain to the Corpus
       Christi on the 15th. The previous record was 0.76 inches set bach
       in 1937. Cloud cover and rainfall on the outskirts of Beryl was the
       cause for cool high temperatures on Tuesday. The high temperature
       in Brownsville on Tuesday the 15th was 84 F. This establishes a new
       record for the coolest maximum temperature for the date, the old
       record was 85F. set back in 1881.
       Hurricane/Tropical Storm Debby weakened as it moved across the
       Carribbean for the latest update see, NOAA/NHC Tropical Prediction
       Center. As of 11AM EDT on the 24th, Debby was downgraded to a
       trough or open wave and then dissipated.
       Super Typhoon Billis crossed Taiwan and dissipated in southeast
       China on Thursday. Bilis devastated Taiwan on Tuesday (22) and
       Wednesday (23), claiming 11 lives, injuring at least 80 others,
       trapping 18 in mudslides and leaving 10 people missing. There were
       no storm-related causalities reported in China but Bilis caused
       mudslides and widespread flooding in both countries, and a mudslide
       damaged sections of a railway in southern China. The complete media
       report is available here.

       Elsewhere, around the globe, flooding is causing widespread
       problems in Southeast Asia, especially in Cambodia , Thailand and
       parts of Vietnam. The flooding is the worst in decades along the
       Mekong River in Vietnam. In China, media reports indicate that over
       50 people have died in 2 southern Chinese provinces as a result of
       typhoon Maria. The typhoon hit between the coastal cities of
       Huizhou and Shanwei on September 1st, 2000. Tropical storm Kaimi
       and Typhoon Wukong also brought deadly rains to parts of southeast
       Asia.
       According to media reports as of the 12th, at least three people
       were killed by flooding and landslides in the industrial city of
       Nagoya and surrounding areas in central Japan on Tuesday as Typhoon
       Saomai triggered the region's heaviest rains in at least a century.
       Central Japan had received a record 600 millimeters (24 inches) of
       rain by Tuesday (12th) afternoon. The deluge caused four deaths,
       flooded roads, triggered mudslides and damaged houses. According to
       a Japanese Meteorological Agency official, "the storm was expected
       to dump rain for another two days, so people should remain on
       alert". See the updated CNN Media Report.
       According to media reports, more than 45,000 residents of Ningbo, a
       port city in southeastern China, and outlying Zhoushan Island
       evacuated their homes as Typhoon Saomai delivered heavy rains and
       winds gusting to 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour. Officials
       reported that more than 700 houses collapsed in the region, and
       that 10 fishing boats collided in the heavy winds off Zhoushan
       Island. This region in China had heavy rains in August due to
       tropical systems. The outer feeder bands of the storm lashed China.
       Typhoon Saomai was moving slowly northeast toward the Korean
       Peninsula on the 15th. This area of Asia also had torrential
       flooding rains in August.
       Tropical Storm/Hurricane Gordon brought heavy rains and isolated
       tornadoes to Florida on Sunday (17th). The storm dumped over 8
       inches of rain in Seabring, FL in the central part of the state.
       The storm weakened steadily on Sunday (17th) then became
       extratropical on the Monday (18th) but brought locally heavy rains
       across parts of Georgia and the eastern Carolina's into southeast
       Virginia to start the workweek.

Hurricane Logbook - Interesting Facts and Climatology- October 2000
       Hurricane Keith Hurricane Keith pounded much of Central America
       early Monday (Oct 2nd) with heavy rain and high winds that had
       coastal residents praying for relief. At 5 a.m. EDT, Keith's center
       was located about 45 miles (70 km) east of Belize City and about 70
       miles (110 km) south-southeast of Chetumal, Mexico, a city of about
       250,000, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami,
       Florida. The storm has moved little for the past 24 hours. With its
       slow motion, Keith was expected to dump rainfall of as much as 20
       inches on some parts of Central America, forecasters said. In
       addition, storm surge flooding recent reports indicate that strong
       northerly winds have emptied the Bay of Chetumal northeast of
       Belize City, people have been walking across the bay. This is an
       extremely dangerous situation because the bay water can rapidly
       return and flood the entire bay and surrounding marshy area in
       short notice.
