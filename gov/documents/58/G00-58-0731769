   The speclab web site has shown sustained growth since its beginning in
   1995.

   There were almost a million hits in 1999 and already over one million
   in 2000! Will we reach 1.5 million?

   Examination of those hits showed predominant interest in our papers and
   the spectral library. Interest is from all over the world. Thank you
   for your continued interest.

   We hope to add many more papers, new spectral libraries, and complete
   imaging spectroscopy analysis products online in 2000.
