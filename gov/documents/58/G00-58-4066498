              Update and Redirect Sample with Browser Detection

   This sample contains a Version Management control hidden at the bottom
   of the page. The form names below do not link directly to their related
   HTML files; instead, clicking the hyperlink calls a JavaScript function
   named Redirect, which is defined in the page.
   Redirect accepts the name of an HTML file in the current directory as a
   parameter, then sets the Version Management control's FormURL property
   and calls the AnalyzeUpdateAndRedirect method. Your form object
   versions will be checked and updated as necessary before proceeding to
   the requested form.

   Memorandum A single page memorandum that automatically places the
   current system date on the form. This form also contains a large
   multiple-line field for data entry.
   Leave Request A leave request form used to request a leave of absence.
   This form illustrates field formatting, basic field calculations, radio
   buttons and drop-down list boxes.
   Purchase Order A requisition form that uses formatting for dates and
   currency fields, calculations to determine the totals and taxes, radio
   buttons, and drop-down list boxes.
