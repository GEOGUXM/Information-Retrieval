SW Technique

   The shortwave algorithm was developed at NASA LaRC by W. F. Staylor. It
   is a parameterized/physical model which utilizes ISCCP-C1 data (Rossow
   et al., 1988) as its primary input data. The current model is a
   modified version of an earlier model by Darnell et al. (1988). A recent
   application of the method is given in Darnell et al. (1992).

   The shortwave algorithm was developed at NASA LaRC by W. F. Staylor.
   Instantaneous downward SW flux (SWDWN) at the surface (insolation) can

   estimated using the model presented in Darnell et al. (1988). Downward
   SW flux at the surface is the product of insolation at the TOA,
   clear-sky atmospheric transmittance and cloud transmittance. Daily
   insolation requires time integration of the instantaneous values from
   sunrise to sunset. Insolation at the TOA is a product of the cosine of
   the solar zenith angle and the distance-corrected solar flux, which is
   calculated daily using 1365 W/m**2 as the solar flux and 1 Astronomical
   Units as the Earth-Sun distance.

   Atmospheric transmittance is a function of surface pressure, surface
   albedo, aerosols, and the effective clear-sky atmospheric optical
   depth. The first three terms account for the atmospheric backscatter of
   surface reflected rays. The effective clear-sky atmospheric optical
   depth is a vertical attenuation factor for solar energy and it is the
   sum of all absorption and scattering processes. These processes include
   absorption and scattering due to gases and aerosols. The broadband
   absorption due to water vapor and ozone, and Rayleigh attentuation are
   estimated using the method of Lacis and Hansen (1974). The broadband
   absorption due to oxygen and carbon dioxide are approximated using the
   method of Yamamoto (1962). Aerosol attenuation is based on World
   Climate Program aerosol models (World Climate Research Program, 1983).
   It should be noted that the Rayleigh and aerosol attenuation terms are
   concerned only with backscattering and/or absorption, but not with
   forward scattering of flux which reaches the surface.

   Cloud transmittance is based on a threshold technique which relates
   boundary values of TOA reflectances for overcast and clear-sky
   conditions and actual measured conditions (from ISCCP). Overcast
   reflectances are estimated from a model by Staylor (1985) using the
   cosines of viewing zenith angle and solar zenith angle, and overcast
   coefficients. These coefficients are determined monthly for each ISCCP
   satellite using data for non-snow covered, totally overcast regions
   having mean cloud optical depths within the top 5 percent of all
   observations. Clear-sky reflectances are determined by one of several
   methods depending on the snow cover and surface type. Over oceans, the
   cosines of viewing zenith angle and solar zenith angle, along with
   clear-sky coefficients are used. These coefficients are determined for
   totally-clear oceans for each satellite every month. For snow-free land
   regions or land regions in which the snow cover does not fluctuate by
   more than 10 percent during the month, daily TOA clear-sky reflectance
   values are computed from the clear-sky pixels. The monthly minimum
   value is used for the entire month. If the snow cover changes by more
   than 10 percent during the month (determined for 5-day intervals), then
   the above procedure is applied to the 5-day periods. Measured
   instantaneous reflectances are the pixel-weighted average of the clear
   and cloudy reflectances. If no value exists for a day (occurs most
   frequently in polar regions), a fill value is provided by one of two
   methods. If a value exists for a longitudinally adjacent region for
   that day, it is used. If it does not exist, then the previous day's
   value is used. This procedure is expanded spatially, then temporally
   until a non-fill value is found.

   Daily surface albedo for all-sky conditions is a function of the daily
   overcast albedo, the daily clear-sky albedo and cloud transmittance.
   Data from Budyko (see Payne 1972) and Ter-Markariantz (see Kondratyev
   1973) were used to estimate clear-sky surface albedos over oceans.
   Estimates of daily overcast albedos over oceans are based on the fact
   that under overcast conditions the effective zenith angle of the
   diffuse rays is about 53 degrees for all zenith angles (cosine = 0.6)
   and therefore is a constant value of 0.065. Monthly average clear-sky
   ERBE TOA albedos were used to estimate surface albedos over
   snow/ice-free land. This approach avoided the need for spectral
   conversions from narrowband to broadband and from radiances to albedos
   (Staylor and Wilber 1990). The ERBE data cover the period March 1985
   through December 1988 and were used as such for those months. The ERBE
   derived surface albedos were found to vary less than 1 percent
   interannually. Therefore, a multi-year monthly average ERBE clear-sky
   TOA albedo was used to derive surface albedo for the corresponding
   months outside the ERBE period.

   SW cloud forcing is the difference between the total-sky net SW flux
   and the clear-sky net SW flux.

LW Technique

   The LW radiative fluxes (both LWDWN and LWNET) are computed using a
   fast parameterization which is based on detailed radiative transfer
   computations (Gupta 1989; Gupta et al. 1992). The inputs for the
   computation are taken from the ISCCP-C1 datasets. LWDWN is computed as

                           LWDWN = LWCS + F2 * AC,

   where LWCS is the clear-sky LWDWN, F2 is the cloud forcing factor, and
   AC is the fractional cloud cover. LWNET is computed as

                       LWNET = LWDWN - SIGMA * TS**4,

   where SIGMA is the Stefan-Boltzman constant (5.67E-08 W/(m**2 K**4)),
   and TS is the surface temperature.

   Details of the development and application of the parameterizations of
   LWCS and F2 in terms of the meteorological parameters are given in
   Gupta (1989) and Gupta et al. (1992). A very brief description of the
   parameterizations is presented here.

   The clear-sky LWDWN (LWCS) is computed as

          LWCS = ( A0 + A1 * V + A2 * V**2 + A3 * V**3 ) * TE**3.7,

   where V = ln W, and W is the total water vapor burden of the
   atmosphere. TE is an effective emitting temperature of the lower
   troposphere, and is computed as

                         TE = KS*TS + K1*T1 + K2*T2,

   where TS is the surface temperature, T1 is the mean temperature of the
   first layer in the ISCCP-C1 data (surface to 800mb), and T2 is the same
   for the second layer (800mb to 680mb). KS, K1, and K2 are weighting
   factors with values of 0.60, 0.35, and 0.05 respectively. The
   regression coefficients A0, A1, A2, and A3 have the following values:

                               A0 = 1.791E-07,
                               A1 = 2.093E-08,
                              A2 = -2.748E-09,
                               A3 = 1.184E-09.

   The cloud forcing factor (F2) is computed as

          F2 = TCB**4 / ( B0 + B1 * WC + B2 * WC**2 + B3 * WC**3 ),

   where TCB is the cloud-base temperature, WC is the water vapor burden
   below the cloud base, and B0, B1, B2, and B3 are regression
   coefficients with the following values:

                               B0 = 4.990E+07,
                               B1 = 2.688E+06,
                              B2 = -6.147E+03,
                               B3 = 8.163E+02.

   All fluxes represented here are in W/m**2, temperatures in K, and water
   vapor burdens in kg/m**2. Cloud-base pressure is obtained by combining
   cloud-top pressure (available from ISCCP-C1 data) with climatological
   estimates of cloud thickness which depend upon cloud height and
   latitude. TCB and WC are computed from the available ISCCP-C1 data
   using the procedure described in Gupta (1989). The above equation for
   F2 is used as such when pressure difference between the surface and
   cloud base is greater than 200 mb. When pressure difference is less
   than or equal to 200 mb, a modified form of this equation as described
   in Gupta et al. (1992) is used.

   LW cloud forcing is the difference between the total-sky net LW flux
   and the clear-sky net LW flux.

Total Flux

   Total net flux and total cloud forcing are the sum of LW and SW
   components. For further information, the user is referred to Darnell et
   al. (1992).

Validation

   Model results have been validated extensively (Darnell et al., 1986,
   1988, 1992; Gupta 1989; Gupta et al., 1992; Whitlock et al., 1995).
   Recent validation have included ground measurements obtained from the
   Swiss Federal Institute of Technology's Global Energy Balance Archive
   (GEBA) and NOAA's Climate Montitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory
   (CMDL). Monthly average SW and LW radiative fluxes were compared.
   Results showed that generally flux errors are within 10 W/m**2. Larger
   errors were found where there are larger uncertainties in the input
   data such as over snow/ice covered surfaces and where the site data did
   not represent the entire grid box. Larger errors in downward SW flux
   were also found over African and South American locations where
   aerosols from biomass burning are not accounted for in the SW model
   (Konzelman et al., 1995).

Error Analysis

   Errors in the fluxes come from the radiation modeling and from the
   meteorological data. Modelling errors are systematic and are generally
   small. Errors from meteorological data are both random and systematic.
   For a detailed analysis of errors the reader is referred to Gupta et
   al. (1993). While larger sources of errors are identified and
   quanitfied, smaller sources, e.g. the occurrence of fog, are difficult
   to quantify. These definitely contribute some to the bias in the
   fluxes.
