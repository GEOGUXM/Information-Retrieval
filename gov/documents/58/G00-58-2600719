     At work in the MTL. Commercial products (process materials) that come
     under direct contact with War Reserve (WR) components or WR product
     during pit production operations must be tested for use and
     compatibility before they can be used. Such testing helps prevent
     adverse interactions and protects the integrity of the WR components or
     WR product.At the Materials Testing Laboratory (MTL), we develop test
     protocols and test process materials using chemical or physical
     analyses and according to WRMCB requirements. These tests check for a
     given material's compatibility with WR components or WR product.
     Specifically, the MTL will:
       * collect lot samples,
       * perform compatibility evaluations on process materials,
       * assemble results into report format, and
       * communicate by formal documentation the results of the
         compatibility evaluations to the Material Test Coordinator (MTC).
