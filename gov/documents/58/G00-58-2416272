        WASHINGTON - Saying it was past time we did something to jump start
        our foundering economy and help Americans that are hurting,
        Congressman David Dreier (R-San Dimas), Chairman of the House Rules
        Committee, voted last night for legislation aimed at helping the
        unemployed and bringing our economy out of recession. The Worker
        Assistance and Economic Recovery Act of 2001, H.R. 3529, was
        approved in the House with bipartisan support, 224-193.

        Economic growth and job creation are the keys to getting our economy
        moving again, Dreier said. Even before September 11th, we knew our
        economy was in trouble. Weve needed to act for some time, and with
        the support of the Presidents leadership, we have today. The plan
        approved today represents a compromise that will meet two critical
        needs - providing displaced workers and their families the
        assistance they need and stimulating the economy in a way that will
        create jobs and encourage investment.

        The Worker Assistance and Economic Recovery Act provides $112
        billion over ten years in tax relief to workers, investors,
        businesses, and the families of the victims of the September 11th
        attacks. It also extends tax rebates to Americans not eligible in
        the previous round. The bill provides 13 weeks of additional
        unemployment assistance to people unemployed since March 15, 2001
        (the start of the recession) and to those who exhaust their regular
        benefits, and includes over $8 billion in health care services.

        Dreier noted that the bill also included growth incentives for
        businesses like accelerated depreciation. This package also
        recognizes the important role that our nation's high tech industries
        have played in our economic growth over the past decade,he said. The
        incentives put into place through this landmark legislation will
        help restore that kind of growth.
