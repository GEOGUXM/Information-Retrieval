       Biomedical and human performance aspects of aviation are studied
       and analyzed by researchers in two major program areas:

       + Toxicology and Accident Research - evaluates medical findings
         gleaned from aircraft accidents to improve the safe operation
         of aircraft.
       + Protection and Survival - Develops injury reducing materials
         and structures, also evaluates survival equipment and
         procedures to protect aircraft occupants.
