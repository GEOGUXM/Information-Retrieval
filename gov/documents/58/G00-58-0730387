     [monitor180.gif] Individual jobs on the Biowulf/Lobos3 system, or the
      load on the entire system, can be monitored with a variety of matrix
           monitors like the one on left. There are also monitors for node
    availability for all nodes or specific nodes (e.g. the 'bigmem' nodes)
                                        and for memory usage on the nodes.

          The image on left is static. The real monitors are automatically
                                                 updated every 30 seconds.

                      These monitors are available to the NIH campus only.
