       Welcome to the genetic disorders web resources page!  This page is
   an attempt to summarize some of the resources available on the World
   Wide Web to research diseases and disorders that are related to our
   DNA.  This site is still being built.  If you have any good web sites,
   or know of diseases not yet posted, please click here for guidelines on
   how to make submissions.

   Submissions - Guidelines on how to contribute to this page

   Alphabetical List - An alphabetical list of the diseases and disorders
   indexed in this site.

   Mendelian Disorders- Inherited abnormalities, divided into Autosomal
   Dominant, Autosomal Recessive, and Sex Linked.

   Chromosomal Defects- Birth defects caused by chromosomal breakage or
   irregular chromosomal number.

   Oncogenic- Cancer-causing defects.

   Mutations-Congenital Defects or non-cancerous diseases caused by
   non-inherited mutation.

   Mitochondrial Disorders - These disorders are caused by mitochondrial
   DNA abnormalities.

   Symptoms- Disorders by symptom, for example Dwarfism

   General Indexes- Good general indices containing medical, scientific
   and personal support information on all genetic diseases from the World
   Wide Web

   Student Activity- This web page, written by professor Carol Sibley of
   University of Washington, is a student activity on how to do web
   searches for genetic diseases.

   DNA Images  - This page contains several useful images of DNA in bitmap
   form

     This web site was developed by Rick Styner and Dr. Sara Stratton, in
     association with Dr. Edward Moler of the Department of Radiation
     Biology, Life Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National
     Laboratory.  This project was part of the Integrated Science
     Partnership Program, funded by the California Post Secondary
     Education Commission
     (Eisenhower Funds).

     Berkeley Lab is operated by the University of California as part of
     the U.S. Department of Energy's national lab system.
