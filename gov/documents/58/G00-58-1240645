   2001 FIRST Robotics Competition

   What is FIRST?

        The FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and
        Technology) Robotics Competition is a highly regarded national
        engineering contest, which immerses high school students in the
        exciting world of engineering.

        Teaming up with engineers from NASA, businesses and universities,
        students get a hands-on, inside look at the engineering profession.
        In six intense weeks, students and engineers work together to
        brainstorm, design, construct and test their "champion robot." The
        teams then compete in a spirited, no-holds-barred tournament
        complete with referees, cheerleaders and time clocks. The result is
        a fun, exciting and stimulating environment in which all
        participants discover the important connection between classroom
        lessons and real-world applications

        The Jet Propulsion Laboratory will work with schools in the Southern
        California region in support of the 2001 FIRST Robotics Competition,
        including hosting a Southern California Regional Competition with
        USC at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, March 15-17, 2001. Those
        outside of Southern California interested in the program should
        contact:
