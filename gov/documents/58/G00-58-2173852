                       Gordon Group Research Interests
     __________________________________________________________________

   The research performed by the ISU quantum chemistry group comprises a
   broad spectrum of developments and applications in ab initio electronic
   structure theory. The main theme of this research is the accurate
   elucidation of complex structures and mechanisms in organic and
   organometallic chemistry, in both the gas phase and in solution. Of
   particular interest to us are:
     * processes in organosilicon chemistry, especially the ways in which
       this chemistry differs from than of the analogous carbon compounds;
     * the molecular structure, bonding, and reaction mechanisms of
       titanium and zirconium chemistry, in order to deduce the
       fundamental differences between the chemistries of Group IVA and
       Group IVB;
     * the roles of transition metals in homogeneous and heterogeneous
       catalysis;
     * the fundamental nature of chemical vapor deposition processes for
       both main group and transition metal compounds ;
     * the fundamental nature of bonding and reactivity of compounds that
       appear to be "hypervalent";
     * the design of new high energy species and of new materials;
     * the manner in which solvents affect molecular structure, bonding
       and reactivity.
     * the design of new materials for extreme environments.
       In order to investigate such a diverse chemical array of chemical
       phenomena, we are engaged in the development of several electronic
       structure tools and in the implementation of these tools into an
       electronic structure computer program. Among the important new
       methods currently under development are:

     * a new method for treating the effects of solvation that includes
       explicit solvent molecules in a tractable manner;
     * new methods for interfacing electronic structure calculations with
       dynamics;
     * improved methods for obtaining accurate wave functions and
       properties for large molecules and for molecules containing heavy
       elements;
     * efficient and effective methods for predicting spin-orbit coupling
       and related non-adiabatic phenomena;
     * new, improved methods for analyzing and interpreting the results of
       complex electronic structure calculations.
     * development of new methods for treating chemistry at surfaces.
     * development of gridless density functional theory

   To facilitate calculations such as those described above, our group
   develops, maintains and distributes (free of charge) the popular
   electronic structure suite of programs called GAMESS (General Atomic
   and Molecular Electronic Structure System). Because GAMESS is
   distributed freely, the development of the code benefits from
   contributions from many collaborators located around the world, in
   academia, government laboratories and industry. Among the many features
   of GAMESS, the most exciting are its enhanced performance due to a
   fully parallel implementation and the advantage it takes of modern
   graphics methods.
