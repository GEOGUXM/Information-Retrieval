   Background

   I am a Physical Chemist with background in x-ray crystallography and
   biomolecular function modeling techniques.

   Research

   I do research aspects of biophysics and molecular modeling relevant to
   structural biochemistry, x-ray crystallography and molecular modeling
   within the context of biomolecular function modeling studies.
