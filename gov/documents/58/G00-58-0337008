   State Intellectual Property
    _____________________________________________________________________

   What is Intellectual Property?

   Intellectual property is any intangible asset that consists of human
   knowledge and ideas. In other words, something of value that cannot be
   physically touched, such as a copyright, trademark, or patent.

   The State possesses all types of intellectual property, such as
   trademarks (e.g. department logos), copyrights (e.g. all publications
   issued by the state, tourism maps, etc.), and patents (e.g. products,
   software, services or systems developed with state funding). Currently,
   no clear comprehensive law addresses the ownership rights of all
   intellectual property created or owned by the State of California, so
   the States intellectual property is governed by many different
   statutes and case law decisions.

   There is also no inventory or archive of all state-owned intellectual
   property, and there is no coordinated state policy clarifying whether
   and how agencies and departments may license the use of State
   intellectual property.

   Attempts to address ownership, licensing, royalties, or permission of
   use, and the enforcement against entities using state intellectual
   property without the States permission is done on a case-by-case basis
   by individual agencies, departments, and boards, often utilizing
   outside counsel.

   The Problem

   Since California law is silent about whether State intellectual
   property is in the public domain, that means that federal law must be
   followed. And under federal law, since the State has not waived any of
   its intellectual property rights, then no state intellectual property
   is in the public domain. So currently, it would be in violation of the
   law to utilize any State produced document, statute, publication, etc.,
   without explicit permission. This may not be what the Legislature
   intends.

   In addition, many copyright, patent and trademark benefits are not
   being utilized efficiently by the state. Private companies are
   capitalizing off state-owned products and information without knowledge
   they are violating or infringing State-owned copyright, trademark, or
   patent rights.

   Because there is no comprehensive policy, different state agencies and
   departments are handling the same type of intellectual property in
   different ways.

   The Solution: SB 875 (Escutia)

   Senate Bill 875 (Escutia), which was introduced at the request of
   Lieutenant Governor Cruz M. Bustamante, directs state agencies to adopt
   policies and procedures that identify, protect, and manage state-owned
   intellectual property.

   Provisions within this legislation require the State Auditor to perform
   an audit of the intellectual property which is "owned, managed, or
   controlled by the state and its agencies, departments, boards, and
   commissions." A preliminary report on the status of the inventory would
   be due by January 5, 2002, with the final audit completed by July 31,
   2002.

   This audit, which is consistent with the practice of private industry
   in assessing intellectual property needs, would be conducted concurrent
   with a survey on the existing intellectual property management
   practices of California and other states. This survey would be
   conducted by a special advisory committee named by the director of the
   Department of General Services, and would include policy
   recommendations for the Governor and the Legislature on how state
   agencies should manage and protect intellectual property under their
   control.

   The Lieutenant Governor believes that the State of California has a
   fiduciary duty to its taxpayers to manage its intellectual property as
   effectively and comprehensively manages its real property. In October
   1999, he co-hosted a symposium on the subject of the States
   intellectual property. It brought up many interesting issues about
   management of State IP. Several of these issues were addressed through
   amendments to SB 875.
