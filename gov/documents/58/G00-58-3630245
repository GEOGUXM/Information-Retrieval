                                Miss Hampton
     Glide through the warm waters of the Chesapeake Bay, visit the $32
   million dollar Virginia Air and Space Center, or take a ride on a 1920
    carousel located on the downtown waterfront. Or how about a pleasant,
       Sunday outdoor concert, or children's theater, or an exhibit on
      waterfowl paintings. And, for jazz, pop and rhythm and blues, the
   Hampton Jazz Festival features some of the finest acts in the business.
