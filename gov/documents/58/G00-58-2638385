                 The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale is a 1-5 rating based on the
                 hurricane's present intensity. This is used to give an estimate of
                 the potential property damage and flooding expected along the coast
                 from a hurricane landfall. Wind speed is the determining factor in
                 the scale, as storm surge values are highly dependent on the slope
                 of the continental shelf in the landfall region. Note that all winds
                 are using the U.S. 1-minute average.

               Category One Hurricane:
                      Winds 74-95 mph (64-82 kt or 119-153 km/hr). Storm surge
                      generally 4-5 ft above normal. No real damage to building
                      structures. Damage primarily to unanchored mobile homes,
                      shrubbery, and trees. Some damage to poorly constructed signs.
                      Also, some coastal road flooding and minor pier damage.
                      Hurricanes Allison of 1995 and Danny of 1997 were Category One
                      hurricanes at peak intensity.

               Category Two Hurricane:
                      Winds 96-110 mph (83-95 kt or 154-177 km/hr). Storm surge
                      generally 6-8 feet above normal. Some roofing material, door,
                      and window damage of buildings. Considerable damage to shrubbery
                      and trees with some trees blown down. Considerable damage to
                      mobile homes, poorly constructed signs, and piers. Coastal and
                      low-lying escape routes flood 2-4 hours before arrival of the
                      hurricane center. Small craft in unprotected anchorages break
                      moorings. Hurricane Bonnie of 1998 was a Category Two hurricane
                      when it hit the North Carolina coast, while Hurricane Georges of
                      1998 was a Category Two Hurricane when it hit the Florida Keys
                      and the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

               Category Three Hurricane:
                      Winds 111-130 mph (96-113 kt or 178-209 km/hr). Storm surge
                      generally 9-12 ft above normal. Some structural damage to small
                      residences and utility buildings with a minor amount of
                      curtainwall failures. Damage to shrubbery and trees with foliage
                      blown off trees and large tress blown down. Mobile homes and
                      poorly constructed signs are destroyed. Low-lying escape routes
                      are cut by rising water 3-5 hours before arrival of the
                      hurricane center. Flooding near the coast destroys smaller
                      structures with larger structures damaged by battering of
                      floating debris. Terrain continuously lower than 5 ft above mean
                      sea level may be flooded inland 8 miles (13 km) or more.
                      Evacuation of low-lying residences with several blocks of the
                      shoreline may be required. Hurricanes Roxanne of 1995 and Fran
                      of 1996 were Category Three hurricanes at landfall on the
                      Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico and in North Carolina, respectively.

               Category Four Hurricane:
                      Winds 131-155 mph (114-135 kt or 210-249 km/hr). Storm surge
                      generally 13-18 ft above normal. More extensive curtainwall
                      failures with some complete roof structure failures on small
                      residences. Shrubs, trees, and all signs are blown down.
                      Complete destruction of mobile homes. Extensive damage to doors
                      and windows. Low-lying escape routes may be cut by rising water
                      3-5 hours before arrival of the hurricane center. Major damage
                      to lower floors of structures near the shore. Terrain lower than
                      10 ft above sea level may be flooded requiring massive
                      evacuation of residential areas as far inland as 6 miles (10
                      km). Hurricane Luis of 1995 was a Category Four hurricane while
                      moving over the Leeward Islands. Hurricanes Felix and Opal of
                      1995 also reached Catgeory Four status at peak intensity.

               Category Five Hurricane:
                      Winds greater than 155 mph (135 kt or 249 km/hr). Storm surge
                      generally greater than 18 ft above normal. Complete roof failure
                      on many residences and industrial buildings. Some complete
                      building failures with small utility buildings blown over or
                      away. All shrubs, trees, and signs blown down. Complete
                      destructon of mobile homes. Severe and extensive window and door
                      damage. Low-lying escape routes are cut by rising water 3-5
                      hours before arrival of the hurricane center. Major damage to
                      lower floors of all structures located less than 15 ft above sea
                      level and within 500 yards of the shoreline. Massive evacuation
                      of residential areas on low ground within 5-10 miles (8-16 km)
                      of the shoreline may be required. Hurricane Mitch of 1998 was a
                      Category Five hurricane at peak intensity over the western
                      Caribbean. Hurricane Gilbert of 1988 was a Category Five
                      hurricane at peak intensity and is the strongest Atlantic
                      tropical cyclone of record.
