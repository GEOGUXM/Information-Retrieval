       Electron Microscopy Center (EMC) conducts materials research using
    advanced microstructural characterization methods and through the use
     of the microscope Intermediate Voltage Electron Microscope (IVEM).
   Research by EMC personnel includes microscopy based studies in high Tc
        superconducting materials, irradiation effects in metals and
   semiconductors, phase transformations, and processing related structure
                 and chemistry of interfaces in thin films.
