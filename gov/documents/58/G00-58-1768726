                             Al Qaeda Training Manual

      The attached manual was located by the Manchester (England)
      Metropolitan Police during a search of an Al Qaeda member's home. The
      manual was found in a computer file described as "the military series"
      related to the "Declaration of Jihad." The manual was translated into
      English and was introduced earlier this year at the embassy bombing
      trial in New York. The Department is only providing the following
      selected text from the manual because it does not want to aid in
      educating terrorists or encourage further acts of terrorism.
