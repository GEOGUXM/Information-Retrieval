                         Sacramento River GIS System

      This system has been developed by the California Department of Water
      Resources as a planning tool to help resolve management questions as
      they arise at specific river locations.  The Sacramento River GIS is
      viewable using ArcView software.  Information currently available
      includes historical river channels since 1896, geology, soils,
      projected erosion areas, property ownership, areas within the Federal
      Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 100-year flood line, and current and
      historical riparian habitat.  To schedule an appointment to view or
      discuss the Sacramento River GIS contact:
