   General Information about the Appointments Division
   The Governor's Appointment Responsibility
   The authority to make governmental appointments is one of the powers
   given to the Governor of Texas by the state's constitution. During a
   four-year term, a Governor will make about 3,000 appointments. The
   Governor may appoint individuals to manage the Executive Branch of
   government as well as certain other open positions. Most appointments
   are one of the following:
   1) State officials and members of state boards, commissions and
   councils that carry out the laws and direct the policies of state
   government activities;
   2) Members of task forces that advise the Governor or executive
   agencies on specific issues and policies; and

   3) State elected and judicial offices when vacancies occur by
   resignation or death of the office holder.

   In the case of a vacancy in the United States Senate, the Governor has
   the power to call a special election and to appoint someone if Congress
   is in session to serve until that election.

   To apply with the Governor Perry Administration, please read about the
   Appointment Process prior to completing the Appointment Application. At
   the Available Appointments link you may view current appointment
   opportunities by category.
