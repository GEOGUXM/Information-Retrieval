     __________________________________________________________________

        As your independently elected Comptroller, I serve as the County's
   Chief Accounting and Reporting Officer, Chief Fiscal Officer and Chief
   Auditing Officer.

        As the Chief Accounting and Reporting Officer, the Comptroller is
   responsible for overseeing all accounting operations of the County,
   Erie County Medical Center/Home and Erie Community College. The
   County's last audited financial statements were for fiscal year 2000.

        In addition, I am proud to announce that, for the thirteenth
   consecutive year, Erie County has received the prestigious Certificate
   of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting from the
   Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and
   Canada.

        As the Chief Fiscal Officer, the Comptroller is responsible for
   investing all County funds. In 2000, this Office earned in excess of
   $18 million in interest earnings. This is a major source of revenue for
   the County and results in a reduction to the property tax levy. The
   Comptroller annually sells bonds and notes to finance capital projects.
   In 2000 $ 39.8 million in bonds were sold. Also, agreements were made
   with the New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation to draw a
   maximum of $ 3.3 million against Bond Anticipation Notes issued for
   various sewer projects. To meet the cash flow needs of the County, the
   Comptroller issues Revenue Anticipation Notes.

        In October of 2000, the Comptroller was instrumental in selling
   the County's share of future revenues from the National Tobacco
   Settlement. The County realized $211.7 million through this historic
   transaction and negated any risk associated with a decreasing payment
   stream from the tobacco companies resulting from reduced consumption,
   additional lawsuits, or bankruptcy of a tobacco manufacturer. The
   proceeds derived from this sale will allow various initiatives to be
   undertaken that should benefit area residents and the local economy for
   years to come.

        The Comptroller's Division of Audit and Control is responsible for
   the audit of all county departments and contract agencies. For the 12
   month period ending June 2001, this Office released 13 audits.

        If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.
