                           Tuition and Loan Relief
                          Due to Terrorist Attacks
     __________________________________________________________________

   On October 12, 2001, Governor Bob Holden, in a press release, discussed
   tuition and loan relief for student soldiers attending Missouri
   institutions. Students should contact the financial aid office at their
   school for information about institutional charges and re-enrollment.
   Financial aid professionals, please visit our detailed, up-to-date
   information.

   Loan Relief
   The U.S. Department of Education has issued guidance to the financial
   aid community about loan relief for student loan borrowers due to the
   September 11 terrorist attacks. Provisions apply to borrowers who:
     * are members of the National Guard and Ready Reserves who are called
       to active duty for more than 30 days,
     * are active members of the Armed Forces who may be reassigned to
       other duty stations for more than 30 days,
     * reside or work in any one of the five federally designated disaster
       areas of New York City (the Bronx, Queens, Staten Island,
       Manhattan, and Brooklyn), and
     * others who were impacted by the terrorist attacks.

   MOSTARS will offer Advantage Missouri Program borrowers affected by the
   terrorist attacts the same relief that the U.S. Department of Education
   has authorized for federal student loan borrowers.

   Borrowers should contact their loan holders for more information. If a
   borrower is uncertain about who holds their loan, they should visit the
   Mapping Your Future Loan Locator.
     * Borrowers with loans in an in-school, grace period, or in-school
       deferment status will have that loan status extended for up to
       three years during their active duty service.
     * Borrowers with defaulted student loans will not be required to make
       payment during their active duty service through September 14, 2002
       (unless the U.S. Department of Education extends this period).
     * Borrowers with loans in repayment status may be granted a deferment
       during their active duty service for up to one year (unless
       supporting documentation and a written agreement are provided or
       the U.S. Department of Education extends the one-year limit).

   Borrowers will continue to be responsible for interest that accrues on
   their student loans while on active duty (though they can choose to
   have the interest added to their loans to be paid later), as follows:
     * Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans in a repayment, forbearance, or
       default status
     * Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans in an in-school, grace,
       deferment, forbearance, repayment, or default status
     * Federal Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) in
       repayment, deferment, forbearance, or defaulted status

   Loan Relief for Borrowers who Reside or Work in the Designated Disaster
   Area
   Loan holders must grant forbearance to borrowers who reside or work in
   the Designated Disaster Area. The forbearance is effective from
   September 11, 2001 through January 31, 2002.

   Affected borrowers who have not received notification of forbearance
   under this provision should contact their loan holder.
