                                  CDCVS FAQ

   Q1:  How do I get write permission to a particular module?
   A1:  Ask someone who currently has write permission to give you write
   permission?

   Q2:  How do I determine who has write permission?
   A2:  "cvs co check_access.d/<module>", then inspect
   check_access.d/<module>/allowed.
               The users listed in the allowed file have permission to
   give you write permission.
               If there is a line like "#include <group>" in the allowed
   file, you will need to
               "cvs co check_access.d/groups/<group>".   Then inspect the
   files "allowed" and/or
               "members" in check_access.d/groups/<group>.

   Q3:  How do I give someone write permission to a particular module?
   A3:  Three steps (assuming you have write permission to the module):
                      1) "cvs co check_access.d/<module>"
                      2) edit check_access.d/<module>/allowed
                      3) "cvs commit check_access.d/<module>/allowed"

   Q4: How do I give a group of users permission to write to a module?
   A4:  Place the line "#include <group>" where <group> is the name  of
   the group alias constructed for this purpose.

   Q5: How do I add someone to a group alias?
   A5:  Three steps (assuming you have write permission to the group
   alias):
                      1) "cvs co check_access.d/groups/<group>"
                      2) edit check_access.d/groups/<group>/allowed or
                                   check_access.d/groups/<group>/members
                      3) "cvs commit check_access.d/groups/<group>
               If the user is placed in allowed, they have permission to
   add other users to the group alias.
               Users in the members file do not have this permission.

   Q6: How do I request CVS access from a kerberized machine in the FNAL
   realm?
   A6:  Request CVS access from the Fermilab Helpdesk, providing them with
   your kerberos principal name.

   Q7:  How do I request CVS access from another machine using ssh?
   A7:  Request CVS access from the Fermilab Helpdesk, providing them with
   your ssh-key.

   Q8:  How do I request CVS access from a Windows NT machine?
   A8:  Request pserver access from the Fermilab Helpdesk.

   Q9:  I was able to commit to the cvs repository before, but now it
   doesn't work.  What's wrong?
   A9:  Check the contents of the file CVS/Root in the directory in which
   you are working .  It should contain
               something like "cvsuser@cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/cd".  If it
   doesn't, this module was probably checked out
               of a repository you don't have write permission to.  This
   can be fixed by downloading this fixcvsroot
               script and running it in the directory containing the
   broken module.

   Q10:  How do I check out a module with read-write access?
   A10:  Use cvsuser@cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/cd for your CVSROOT.  The
   simplest way to do this is on the
                   command line:
                        cvs -d cvsuser@cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/cd checkout
   foobar
                   To check out the module "foobar". CVS will remember the
   "-d cvsuser@cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/cd"
                    business for the checked out module. You shouldn't
   have to type it again to do updates, commits, etc.

   Q11:  Why do I get this message?
                       User `' is not permitted to modify module `foobar'
                       cvsh is unable to determine your username. If you
   are using public
                       key access, please make sure you have ssh-agent
   running.
                       cvs server: Pre-commit check failed
                       cvs [server aborted]: correct above errors first!
   A11:  You need to have ssh-agent running. See instructions on using cvs
   with ssh.

   Q12:  I followed the instructions from A11, but I still get the message
   from Q11!
   A12:  The authentication mechanism FNAL uses requires you to forward
   your agent. Agent forwarding is
                   probably turned off in your system ssh_config file.
   Grep /etc/ssh_config (or maybe /etc/ssh/ssh_config)
                   for ForwardAgent to find out.   To workaround this
   problem, you need to create a script:
                          #!/bin/sh
                           ssh -A $*
                   Set the environment variable CVS_RSH to point to the
   script. You should now be in business.

   Q13:  How do I import a module into the cvs repository?
   A13:  Sit inside the top directory of the module, then issue the
   command:
                     cvs import  <modulename>  <vendor_tag>  <release_tag>
                 Where modulename = is the module name (obviously)
                                    vendor_tag = possibly a vendor tag
   (v4_1) or some other string (Fermilab, <username>, etc.)
                                   release_tag = something to denote this
   initial import, possibly "initial".
                   Note that vendor_tag and release_tag are only used
   later to check out a copy of the initially imported
                   module, even after many changes have been checked in.
   For this reason, the exact value of these
                   fields is often not important.  However, they must not
   be the same and must start with a letter.
