   The results of the CORE experiments are not in general as good as
   scheduled. Two quantitative measures of this are (1) the estimates of
   observed SEFD that can be compared with scheduled SEFDs and (2) the
   formal uncertainties (sigmas) of parameters estimated from actual
   experiment data compared with uncertainties based on scheduled
   observations. These uncertainties are computed using the geodetic
   analysis program SOLVE. The estimated parameters are either earth
   orientation parameters or station positions.

   (1) SEFDs

   The results of the comparison of observed versus scheduled SEFDs
   appears on the web page for each session (snr summary file). In the
   station table for X- and S-band, the ‘Fact’ column gives the factor, F,
   such that

   observed SNR = F1*F2*scheduled SNR.

   Since SNR ~ 1/Ö [SEFD[1]*SEFD[2]],

   observed SEFD[1] = scheduled SEFD[1]/[F1*F2]

   For example, if a receiver ran warm, typically the station factor would
   be ~0.65 so that the observed SEFD ~ 1500 Jy/[0.65*0.65] = 3550 Jy

   (2) Solve Analysis

   The formal uncertainties of estimated parameters depend on
     * Observed SEFDs
     * clocklike errors, e.g., unstable maser behavior, or bad phasecal
     * troposphere noise
     * missing stations (the effect of this can be seen in both the
       simulated and the observed sigmas)

   The figures linked in the table below show the observed formal EOP
   sigmas compared with the simulated sigmas based on scheduled
   observations. The observed sigmas have generally met the 1998 goal, but
   have been greater than the simulated sigmas.

   The simulations indicate that the CORE-A experiments give the smallest
   EOP uncertainties. CORE-A was planned to have the same stations in each
   session, although some substitutions have occurred due to station
   problems. The three CORE-B networks each have a set of core stations,
   but 1-3 additional stations have been added. Since these additional
   stations are not the same for each session, these networks are not as
   stable as CORE-A. The reason that CORE-A should do better is that it
   has a much greater north-south extent since it includes Hartrao and
   Hobart. The disadvantage of this network is that those two southern
   sites are not as well connected to the rest of the network because they
   can only observe significantly with 1 or 2 sites. One of the CORE-Bs
   (CORE-B209, 98JUN17) actually had the best sigmas of any of the CORE
   experiments. This was an 8-station network with a southern hemisphere
   station DSS45 well-connected with Kashima and Kokee.

   When observed data is analyzed, we estimate the relative clock delay
   between the reference station and each other station in the network. To
   account for baseline dependent clocklike errors, we generally estimate
   baseline clock parameters for the baselines between the non-reference
   stations. These parameters are supposed to account for nonclosure of
   the group delays around a triangle of sites (that is, the sum of the
   group delays should equal zero). Possible baseline-dependent effects
   are (1) feed cross polarization leakage, (2) complicated source
   structure, and (3) mismatch in passbands between stations that causes
   phase misalignments (due to a missing channel, feed response, or
   different VC/BBC filter delays). The EOP sigmas for the CORE-A network
   are especially sensitive to estimating the baseline clock parameters to
   Hobart. When they are estimated in the simulation , the EOP sigmas are
   about 2 m s, 60 m as, and 50 m as for UT1, X-Wobble, and Y-Wobble. This
   accounts for a large portion of the difference between observed and
   simulated sigmas for CORE-A.
