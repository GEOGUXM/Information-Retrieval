                          Write Your Representative


   WELCOME! This service is provided to assist you in finding and
   contacting Members of the United States House of Representatives.
   Please note that the contact information accessible through this
   service is provided by each Member office.

   To identify and write your Representative:
    1. Select your State
    2. Enter the first 5 digits of your ZIP Code
    3. Click on the Submit Button

   In some cases, after submitting this information, you will receive a
   message asking for the additional 4 digits of the extended ZIP code. If
   you don't know your extended ZIP Code, you can use the ZIP+4 Lookup
   service provided by the United States Postal Service National Customer
   Support Center. If, after entering the state and Zip Code, you are sent
   to a page with only a mailing address and/or phone number it means that
   your Representative does not use the Write Your Representative Service
   for E-Mail. Some Representatives choose to use methods other than
   E-Mail for communicating with their constituents. Alternate contact
   information is given.

   Enter your:
   State [Choose One__________]
