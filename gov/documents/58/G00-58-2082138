Prescription for Health

   One of my priorities is to encourage everyone to adopt a healthy
   lifestyle.  I created a prescription pad with my top recommendations
   for healthy living and try my best to give this to as many people as
   possible.

   The prescription pad below is interactive.  You can choose one or more
   recommendations and select "submit" to view links offering supporting
   information.  You can also select "print" below for your own copy of
   this prescription to post as a reminder.
