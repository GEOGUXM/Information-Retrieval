                Overview of the State Planning Grants Program

                     2002 Grant Application Information

   The State Planning Grants Program provides one-year grants to States to
   develop plans for providing access to affordable health insurance
   coverage to all their citizens. States are designing approaches that
   provide health insurance benefits similar in scope to the Federal
   Employees Health Benefit Plan, Medicaid, coverage offered to State
   employees or other similar quality benchmarks.

   At the conclusion of the grant, each State will submit a report to the
   Secretary of Health and Human Services that identifies the
   characteristics of the uninsured within its State and proposals for
   providing them with affordable health insurance coverage. Together,
   these reports will provide additional data about the characteristics of
   the uninsured generally and potential models for other States seeking
   to provide comprehensive coverage.
