   All that we do in space science is part of a quest to understand our
   cosmic origins and destiny, and how these are linked by the cycles of
   evolution.

   NASA's Goals for Solar System Exploration [dot-blue.gif]
   [whitedot.gif]
   Goals Graphic
     * Understand the nature and history of our Solar System, and what
       makes Earth similar to and different from its planetary neighbors;
     * Understand the origin and evolution of life on Earth;
     * Understand the external forces, including comet and asteroid
       impacts, that affect life and the habitability of Earth;
     * Identify locales and resources for future human habitation within
       the solar system;
     * Understand how life may originate and persist beyond Earth; and
     * Make the solar system a part of the human experience in the same
       way that Earth is, and hence lay the groundwork for human expansion
       into the solar system in the coming century.

   Solar System Exploration Strategy [dot-blue.gif]
   [whitedot.gif]

   NASA's Space Science Enterprise Strategic Plan tells about the science
   goals and objectives that will lead toward answers to the fundamental
   questions: How did the universe begin and evolve? How did we get here?
   Where are we going? Are we alone? It lays out a near-term program of
   activities to pursue these goals. It tells how NASA's Office of Space
   Science will invent and demonstrate the new technolgoies neded to
   pursue this ambitious vision, and how it will contribute to human space
   flight. And, it explains the plan to share the excitement and
   understanding from these discoveries with teachers, schoolchildren, and
   the general public.

   The Exploration of the Solar System Roadmap summarizes the scientific
   objectives and programmatic recommendations for the Exploration of the
   Solar System. This draft was provided as input to the NASA Office of
   Space Science planning workshop, held November 2-4, 1999, in Galveston,
   Texas. The resulting Space Science Strategic Plan was published in the
   summer of 2000. An enhanced website will be available at this location
   in the near future.

   The NASA Strategic Plan includes both near-term priorities - flying the
   Space Shutle safely and building the International Space Station - and
   longer-term investments in America's future - developing more
   affordable, reliable means of access to space and conducting
   cutting-edge scientific and tecnological research.

   The Solar System Exploration Subcommittee (SSES) is chartered to
   provide advice and recommendations to the SScAC on all aspects of solar
   system exploration. This consists of a balanced program of major,
   moderate and small missions, combined with essential ground based
   activities and Earth-orbiting payloads. Scientific goals include
   exploration of the solar system, understanding its origin and the
   evolution of planets, comets, and asteroids, and understanding the
   environment for life. The program will utilize several complementary
   approaches: a strong research program, mission operations and data
   analysis programs, a systematic exploration of the solar system and
   flight missions, and from the ground the identification and development
   of new technical capabilities for planetary science and exploration,
   the expansion of an instrument development program for flight missions,
   strategic planning, initiation and studies for advanced mission
   concepts.

   The National Academy of Sciences Space Studies Board (SSB) provides
   external and independent scientific and programmatic guidance to NASA
   and other government agencies in the basic subdisciplines of space
   research. The SSB oversees a constellation of standing committees and
   ad hoc task groups, which produce long-range strategic research plans
   and prioritization of goals, as well as progress assessments.

   The SSB, its committees, and ad hoc task groups document their work
   through peer-reviewed reports and letters. In addition, the Board may
   comment, based on its publicly established opinions, in testimony to
   Congress.

   The SSB is part of the Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics,
   and Applications (CPSMA) of the National Research Council, the
   principal operating agency of the National Academies.

   The National Academy of Sciences Committee on Lunar and Planetary
   Exploration (COMPLEX) advises the Space Studies Board on the entire
   range of planetary system studies that can be conducted from space as
   well as on ground-based activities in support of space-based efforts.
   The disciplinary scope of its task includes geoscience, atmospheres,
   exobiology, particles and fields, and planetary astronomy. The
   committee assists the Board in carrying out studies, monitoring the
   implementation of strategies, and providing evaluations of programs and
   strategic priorities for NASA and other government agencies.
