   The NOAA Ship TOWNSEND CROMWELL conducts fishery and living marine
   resource research in support of the National Marine Fisheries Service
   (NMFS), Honolulu Laboratory in Honolulu, Hawaii. The ship normally
   operates in the Pacific in and around the Hawaiian Island Archipelago.
   The ship collects fish and crustacean specimens using bottom trawls,
   longlines, and fish traps. Fish larvae, eggs and plankton are also
   collected using plankton nets and surface and midwater larval nets. The
   vessel is operated by the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations.

   The CROMWELL maintains a web site titled Student Connection. The web
   site utilizes the Internet and Inmarsat (satellite communications), to
   provide twice weekly communication between students and the research
   ship. Through this web site, students can follow the vessel's daily
   operations through regularly posted pictures and write-ups.

   The CROMWELL was named after Townsend Cromwell.
