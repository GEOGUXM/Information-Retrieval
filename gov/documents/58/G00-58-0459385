  Mineral Resources Program

                              Program Information

   The USGS Mineral Resources Program is the only Federal research effort
   focused on mineral issues that integrates environmental, resource, and
   economic factors. The program has undergone considerable change
   recently. Some of these changes were highlighted and resulted from a
   1996 review of the Mineral Resources Program's National Plan by the
   National Research Council. These changes include increased program
   emphasis on partnering, database accessibility for decisionmaking,
   mineral environmental studies, assessments of industrial minerals,
   applied deposit research, and geochemical backgrounds and baselines.
   Other changes stemmed from the 1996 transfer of the minerals
   information functions from the former U.S. Bureau of Mines which added
   extensive capabilities and responsibilities in collecting, assessing,
   and analyzing the production, consumption, and materials flow of over
   100 commodities from 190 countries.

   These changes have resulted in new comprehensive capabilities and
   activities that cover almost all aspects of the mineral cycle from
   deposit discovery to mineral recycling. The Mineral Resources Program
   addresses three major types of mineral issues facing the Nation today:
   * Sustainability and Societal Need
       * Economy and Public Policy
       * Environment and Public Health
       * Technology and Information Dissemination

   Partners.- All projects in the program are leveraged by working with
   partners in other Federal, State, and local agencies, universities, and
   industry. Over half of the studies conducted have an environmental
   component and over half of the projects are providing direct scientific
   support to land management and regulatory agencies. Collaboration with
   other Federal and State agencies focuses on meeting information needs
   concerning the lands they administer, including a wide range of topics
   from land management plans to characterizing Superfund sites. Through
   university cooperative agreements, the program partners with academia
   and industry to conduct basic research on ore forming processes and
   geochemical surficial processes that aid in understanding the
   environmental consequences of deposit weathering, extraction, and use.
   Through an extensive network of over 18,000 industry and State
   collaborators, the program synthesizes and disseminates high quality
   national and international production data that are useful to
   policymakers, land managers, industry, environmental community,
   regulators, economists, and educators.
