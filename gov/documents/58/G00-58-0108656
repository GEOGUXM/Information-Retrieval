     The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service is a unique agency of
     the U.S. Government, created by Congress in 1947 to help prevent,
     manage and resolve conflict.  Today, this mission is accomplished by a
     cadre of nearly 200 full-time federal mediators, who operate as third
     party neutrals from more than 70 field offices strategically located
     throughout the country.

     The primary focus of FMCS work is mediating contract negotiation
     disputes between employers and the unions that represent their
     employees.  FMCS helps employers and unions achieve the related goals
     of profits and jobs, and thereby contributes to the strength of the
     economy.

     FMCS offers a wide range of custom-designed services and training
     workshops.  FMCS helps employers and unions improve workplace
     relationships and more effectively work together on issues of mutual
     interest.

     The fastest growing aspects of FMCS work include consulting, systems
     design, education/training, facilitation and convening, mediating EEO
     and other workplace disputes, regulatory negotiations, non-workplace
     mediation, environmental disputes and international cases.
