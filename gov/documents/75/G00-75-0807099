   These Employee profiles and charts have been compiled in order to
   provide demographic information about employees at the Los Alamos
   National Laboratory. They comprise various observations of the Lab's
   population (e.g. age, series, pay status, ethnicity, gender, etc.) and
   are representative of a large percentage of the ad hoc requests HR
   Information Systems responds to daily. Some of the reports may be more
   useful than others. If you have any comments or questions, please let
   us know. Call Jim Van Hecke (5-1863) or John Pantano (7-0270).

   These tables and charts will be updated as soon after the first of each
   month as possible.
