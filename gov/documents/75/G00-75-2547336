   Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General
   Program and Management Improvement Recommendations The Orange Book June
   Gibbs Brown Inspector General 2000 OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL The
   mission of the Office of Inspector General (OIG), as mandated by Public
   Law 95-452, as amended, is to protect the integrity of the Department
   of Health and Human Services' (HHS) programs as well as the health and
   welfare of beneficiaries served by those programs. This statutory
   mission is carried out through a nationwide network of audits,
   investigations, and inspections conducted by the following operating
   components. Office of Audit Services The OIG's Office of Audit Services
   (OAS) provides all auditing services for HHS, either by conducting
   audits with its own audit resources or by overseeing audit work done by
   others. Audits examine the performance of HHS programs and/or its
   grantees and contractors in carrying out their respective
   responsibilities, and are intended to provide independent assessments
   of HHS programs and operations in order to reduce waste, abuse, and
   mismanagement and to promote economy and efficiency throughout the
   Department. Office of Evaluation and Inspections The OIG's Office of
   Evaluation and Inspections (OEI) conducts short-term management and
   program evaluations (called inspections) that focus on issues of
   concern to the Department, the Congress, and the public. The findings
   and recommendations contained in the inspection reports generate rapid,
   accurate, and up-to-date information on the efficiency, vulnerability,
   and effectiveness of departmental programs. Office of Investigations
   The OIG's Office of Investigations (OI) conducts criminal, civil, and
   administrative investigations of allegations of wrongdoing in HHS
   programs or to HHS beneficiaries and of unjust enrichment by providers.
   The investigative efforts of OI lead to criminal convictions,
   administrative sanctions, or civil money penalties. The OI also
   oversees State Medicaid fraud control units which investigate and
   prosecute fraud and patient abuse in the Medicaid program. Office of
   Counsel to the Inspector General The Office of Counsel to the Inspector
   General (OCIG) provides general legal services to OIG, rendering advice
   and opinions on HHS programs and operations, and providing all legal
   support in OIG's internal operations. The OCIG imposes program
   exclusions and civil monetary penalties on health care providers and
   litigates those actions within the Department. The OCIG also represents
   OIG in the global settlement of cases arising under the Civil False
   Claims Act, develops and monitors corporate integrity agreements,
   develops model compliance plans, renders advisory opinions on OIG
   sanctions to the health care community, and issues fraud alerts and
   other industry guidance. INTRODUCTION THE ORANGE BOOK The Orange Book
   is a compendium of significant unimplemented, nonmonetary
   recommendations for improving departmental operations. The Office of
   Inspector General (OIG) believes that implementation of these
   recommendations will benefit the Department of Health and Human
   Services (HHS) and its customers through increased operational
   effectiveness and assurance that governmental resources are controlled
   by reliable financial management and accounting systems. Generally,
   these recommendations can be implemented by administrative action,
   while some call for a change in legislation. Although these
   recommendations generally have a nonmonetary impact when implemented,
   the Department may achieve some programmatic savings. The OIG
   recommendations for proposed legislation are not removed until the law
   has been enacted-not just proposed. For administrative issues,
   recommendations are not removed until the action has been substantially
   completed. The Orange Book supplements other OIG reports. The Inspector
   General Act requires that OIGs' semiannual reports to the Congress
   include "...an identification of each significant recommendation
   described in previous semiannual reports on which corrective action has
   not been completed." In compliance with the Act, significant
   recommendations are highlighted in the semiannual reports. Because of
   the abbreviated nature of these reports and the potentially significant
   impact of OIG recommendations, we prepare the Orange Book to elaborate
   further on our most significant nonmonetary issues. Through the Orange
   Book, HHS officials, Office of Management and Budget officials, and the
   Congress have in one document significant program and management
   improvement recommendations. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES The Department
   promotes the health and welfare of Americans and provides essential
   human services to persons of every age group. It touches every aspect
   of life for each American citizen. Over 80 percent of the HHS budget
   provides income support and medical care coverage for the elderly,
   disabled, and the poor. The balance of the budget provides research
   into the causes of disease, promotes preventive health measures,
   supports the provision of health and social - services, and combats
   alcoholism and drug abuse. The Department operates within four
   agencies: Health Care Financing, Public Health, Children and Families,
   and Older Americans, as well as general departmental management. An
   overview of these agencies and related OIG findings and recommendations
   are highlighted in separate sections of this Orange Book. Table of

   Financing Overview The Health Care Financing agency encompasses the
   Medicare and Medicaid programs, and the State Children's Health
   Insurance Program (SCHIP). The Medicare program provides health care
   coverage for individuals through Part A and Part B insurances. s
   Medicare Part A provide hospital insurance protection for covered
   services to persons age 65 or older and to certain disabled persons. B
   Medicare Part (supplementary medical insurance) provides insurance
   protection against most of the costs of health care to persons age 65
   and older and certain disabled persons who elect this coverage. The
   services covered are medically necessary physician services, outpatient
   hospital services, outpatient physical therapy, speech pathology
   services, and certain other medical and health services. The Medicaid
   program provides grants to States for medical care for more than 42
   million low-income people. s Federal matching rate were determined on
   the basis of a formula that measures relative per capita income in each
   State. Eligibility for the Medicaid program is, in general, based on a
   person's eligibility for cash assistance programs. The SCHIP expands
   health coverage to uninsured children whose families earn too much to
   qualify for Medicaid but too little to afford private coverage. is a
   partnership between the Federal The program and State Governments in
   which States may choose to expand their Medicaid programs, design new
   SCHIPs or create a combination of both. Related OIG Activities The
   Office of Inspector General (OIG) activities that pertain to the health
   insurance programs administered by the Health Care Financing
   Administration (HCFA) help ensure cost-effective health care, improve
   quality of care, address access to care issues, and reduce the
   potential for fraud, waste, and abuse. Through audits, evaluations, and
   inspections, OIG recommends changes in legislation, regulations, and
   systems to improve health care delivery systems and reduce unnecessary
   expenses. The OIG's reviews assess the adequacy of internal controls,
   identify innovative cost containment techniques, probe for improper
   cost shifting, seek to identify mechanisms to contain increasing
   Medicare/Medicaid costs, and identify efficiencies in program
   administration. The Orange Book 2000 Page 2 of 103 Health Care
   Financing Develop Prepayment Edit to Verify Medical Necessity of
   Ambulance Claims Report Number: OEI-09-95-00412 Final Report: 11/98
   Finding We found that two-thirds of ambulance services that did not
   result in hospital or nursing home admissions or emergency room care on
   the same date of services were medically unnecessary. We estimate that
   Medicare allows approximately $104 million each year for these
   medically unnecessary ambulance services. Current Law/Policy The HCFA
   regulations state that ambulance services are covered only if other
   forms of transportation would endanger the beneficiary's health. The
   Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) mandates that HCFA work with the
   industry to establish a negotiated fee schedule for ambulance payments
   effective January 1, 2000. Recommendation o o Legislative
   Administrative o o Material Weakness The HCFA should develop a
   prepayment edit to verify the medical necessity of ambulance claims
   that are not associated with hospital or nursing home admissions or
   emergency room care. This proposal would provide a solution for one
   group of ambulance services until HCFA and the industry can better
   address issues of medical necessity, including clear and consistent
   definitions. Status Management Response In comments on our draft
   report, HCFA concurred with the need for medical review of these types
   of ambulance claims. The HCFA intends to issue a vulnerability report
   to all Medicare carriers so that where medical review workloads allow,
   each contractor could develop edits to assure appropriate ambulance
   payments. The Orange Book 2000 The Orange Book 2000 Ambulance Page 3 of

   Report: 4/98 OAS-17-98-00098 2/99 OAS-17-00-00500 2/00 Finding The HCFA
   regional offices have oversight responsibility for Medicare
   contractors, which submit periodic financial reports used in preparing
   HCFA's financial statements. Our audit of HCFA's FY 1999 financial
   statements identified continuing problems with the internal control
   procedures used by the regional offices to evaluate Medicare
   contractors' compliance with contracts, laws, and regulations. While we
   noted continued improvement in many regional office oversight
   procedures, certain procedures were not adequate or were not performed
   consistently in all regions to ensure that financial data provided by
   contractors were reliable, accurate, and complete. Current Law/Policy
   Guidance for the oversight effort is found in the Contractors
   Performance Evaluation (CPE) review process. Recommendation o o
   Legislative Administrative o o Material Weakness The HCFA should (1)
   expand current assessment and onsite review procedures to provide the
   appropriate coverage of contractor operations; (2) enhance controls to
   ensure the appropriate tracking of contractor responses to CPE reports
   and the appropriate level of supervisory review related to CPEs; (3)
   provide additional guidance and training to communicate expectations
   and the procedures to be performed by regional offices to ensure that
   HCFA 750/751 and HCFA 1522 reports are submitted timely and are
   properly reconciled to accounting records; (4) develop a review
   protocol to directly evaluate the reliability of contractors'
   self-assessments of their internal controls; (5) ensure that Provider
   Overpayment Recovery and Physician Supplier Overpayment Recovery data
   are accurate, valid, and complete for all Medicare contractors; and (6)
   ensure that all regional offices use and document risk assessments in
   allocating resources to reviews. Status Management Response The HCFA
   has developed a corrective action plan and has attempted to improve
   many of the Medicare oversight procedures performed by the regional
   offices. The Orange Book 2000 The Orange Book 2000 Contractor

   Evaluation of Fraud Unit Performance Report Number: OEI-03-97-00350
   Final Report: 11/98 Finding Fiscal intermediary fraud units differed
   substantially in the number of complaints and cases handled. Some units
   produced few, if any, significant results. Despite HCFA's expectation
   that fraud units proactively identify fraud, half of the fraud units
   did not open any cases proactively. More than one-third of fraud units
   did not identify program vulnerabilities. Current Law/Policy Fiscal
   intermediaries and carriers are companies under contract with HCFA to
   administer a major part of the Medicare program. As of 1993, HCFA
   requires that fiscal intermediaries and carriers have distinct units to
   detect and deter fraud and abuse. From 1993 through 1997, funding was
   based mainly on the contractors' claim volume. However, in Fiscal Year
   1998, HCFA changed the funding methodology to take into account the
   contractors' workload, risk, and performance. All fraud units must meet
   requirements outlined in the Medicare Intermediary Manual: identify
   program vulnerabilities; proactively identify fraud within their
   service area and take appropriate action; determine factual basis of
   complaints of fraud made by beneficiaries, providers, HCFA, Office of
   Inspector General and other sources; and initiate action to deny or
   suspend payments where there is reliable evidence of fraud.
   Recommendation o o Legislative Administrative o o Material Weakness The
   HCFA should: (1) Improve the contractor performance evaluation system
   so that it not only encourages continuous improvement, but also holds
   contractors accountable for meeting specific objectives. (2) Require
   that all contractor performance evaluations list HCFA's national and
   regional objectives and address whether or not the fraud unit is
   meeting those objectives. (3) Establish a standard set of data that can
   be used to measure fraud units' performance in meeting established
   objectives and require that all contractor performance evaluation
   reports contain this data. (4) Establish clear definitions of key words
   and terms, disseminate these definitions and require that program
   integrity staff and fraud unit staff use the same definitions. In a
   future update of the Medicare Intermediary Manual, HCFA should revise
   sections so that these word are consistently used to mean the same
   thing. (5) Provide opportunities for fraud units to exchange ideas,
   compare methods, and highlight best practices relating to fraud and
   abuse detection. Status Management Response The HCFA concurred with our
   recommendations. The HCFA has a number of initiatives underway related
   to (1) national contractor fraud unit training; (2) Medicare fraud
   information specialists; (3) contractor fraud unit teleconferences; (4)
   strengthening consistency for contractor performance evaluation; (5)
   program integrity oversight; and (6) redesigned fraud investigation
   data base. The Orange Book 2000 The Orange Book 2000 Contractor

   a National Medicaid Credit Balance Reporting Mechanism Report Number:
   OAS-05-93-00107 Final Report: 5/95 OAS-04-92-01023 3/93 Finding
   Previous OIG reports indicated that significant amounts of outstanding
   Medicaid credit balances exist nationwide. Currently, many State
   agencies' efforts are inadequate to ensure that, nationwide, the
   majority of Medicaid credit balances are being identified by providers
   and overpayments recovered in a timely manner. Current Law/Policy The
   HCFA does not require State agencies to routinely monitor providers'
   efforts to identify and refund Medicaid credit balances in patient
   accounts. Recommendation o o Legislative Administrative o o Material
   Weakness The HCFA should establish a national Medicaid credit balance
   reporting mechanism similar to the Medicare Part A credit balance
   reporting procedures. Also, HCFA should require its regional offices to
   actively monitor the reporting mechanism established. Status Management
   Response The HCFA agreed to recover estimated outstanding credit
   balances and to perform an evaluation of State agencies' oversight
   activities. Initially, HCFA also agreed with the recommendation to
   establish a national Medicaid credit balance reporting mechanism
   similar to HCFA's Medicare Part A credit balance reporting mechanism.
   Upon reexamination, HCFA decided not to do so, citing the uncertain but
   minimal savings potential and the Administration's commitment to
   enhancing States' flexibility and, specifically, to avoiding the
   imposition of unfunded mandates. The Orange Book 2000 The Orange Book

   Financing Strengthen Review and Accountability of Hospital Quality
   Report Number: OEI-01-97-00050 Final Report: 7/99 Finding The current
   system of hospital oversight has both significant strengths and major
   deficiencies. The HCFA does little to hold either the Joint Commission
   on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations or State agencies
   accountable for their performance in overseeing hospitals. Current
   Law/Policy The 1965 Medicare Act required that hospitals meet certain
   minimum health and safety requirements to participate in the program,
   these requirements are called the conditions of participation. In
   addition to these requirements, Congress also provided that hospitals
   accredited by the Joint Commission were deemed to be in compliance with
   the conditions of participation. About 80 percent of the 6,200
   hospitals that participate in Medicare are accredited by the Joint
   Commission. Hospitals that are not accredited by the Joint Commission
   are surveyed on average every 3.3 years, however, these surveys are a
   low priority for State agencies and the elapsed time between surveys is
   growing. Recommendation o o Legislative Administrative o o Material
   Weakness The HCFA should hold the Joint Commission and State agencies
   more fully accountable to HCFA for their performance in reviewing
   hospitals by (1) Reassessing their approaches for obtaining information
   on Joint Commission and State agency performance. (2) Negotiate with
   the Joint Commission for changes such as (a) conduct more unannounced
   surveys; (b) more random selection of records as part of the survey
   process; (c) provide surveyors with more contextual information about
   the hospitals they survey; and (d) conduct more rigorous assessments of
   hospitals' internal quality improvement efforts. The HCFA should
   periodically assess the justification for the Joint Commission's deemed
   status authority. The HCFA should also determine the appropriate cycle
   for conducting certification surveys of nonaccredited hospitals. Status
   Management Response The HCFA concurred with our report and included a
   detailed hospital quality oversight plan which incorporated many of our
   recommendations and presented a performance measurement strategy which
   will enable public reporting of comparative information on clinical
   performance among Medicare participating hospitals. The quality
   assurance plan initiative was carved out of the hospital regulations
   and revised and should be finalized in the new term. The Orange Book

   Facilities for Quality of Services Report Number: OEI-01-99-00050 Final
   Report: 6/99 Finding The HCFA needs to improve its quality oversight of
   end-stage-renal disease (ESRD) facilities through greater
   accountability of the facilities themselves and through greater
   accountability of the ESRD Networks and State agencies who contract
   with HCFA to provide oversight. Current Law/Policy Section 1881(c) of
   the Social Security Act established ESRD Networks to assure the
   "effective and efficient administration of the [ESRD] benefits." State
   agencies assess compliance of ESRD facilities with Medicare Conditions
   for Participation, listed at 42 C.F.R. § 405, subpart U. Recommendation
   o o Legislative Administrative o o Material Weakness We recommend that
   HCFA hold ESRD facilities more accountable through the following
   actions: revising the conditions of participation, using
   facility-specific performance measures, strengthening the complaint
   system, instituting minimum cycle times for surveys, requiring
   Network/State agency joint initial surveys, and facilitating publicly
   accountable means for identifying serious medical injuries. We
   recommend that HCFA improve Network and State agency accountability by
   developing performance- based evaluations of Networks, improving
   assessment of surveys, and increasing public disclosure of both. Status
   Management Response The HCFA generally concurs with our
   recommendations. The HCFA plans to publish revised conditions for
   coverage in the summer 2001, to request increased ESRD Network funding
   to support facility-specific performance measurements, and to request
   sufficient funding to increase the frequency of certification surveys
   to every 3 years. The Orange Book 2000 The Orange Book 2000 HCFA

   Improve Comparative Information on Medicare+Choice HMO Extra Benefits
   Report Number: OEI-02-99-00030 Final Report: 2/00 Finding Three out of
   four recent HMO enrollees report that lower costs were one of the
   reasons they decided to join their health plan; half of them say it was
   the most important reason. Once enrolled in an HMO, Medicare
   beneficiaries value prescription drugs, regular physicals, and vision
   benefits the most. However, we also found that while most enrollees
   compare plans and extra benefits when joining an HMO, enrollees'
   understanding of their extra benefits is uneven. Further, while
   generally easy to understand, sample HMO marketing materials vary
   greatly. Current Law/Policy The Medicare managed care environment has
   recently undergone significant change. The 1997 Balanced Budget Act
   established Medicare+Choice provisions which set forth a number of
   different "coordinated care" options for beneficiaries to choose from.
   These new options mean that beneficiaries now need to make informed
   choices between the traditional fee-for-service health care program and
   a number of different types of managed care organizations. Many
   Medicare+Choice HMOs provide enrollees coverage that exceeds the
   required Medicare benefits for beneficiaries in the fee-for-service
   program. Recommendation o o Legislative Administrative o o Material
   Weakness We recommend that HCFA develop mechanisms to assure
   comparability of Medicare+Choice HMO plan costs and benefits. Status
   Management Response The HCFA plans to implement the Plan Benefit
   Package as part of the 2001 Medicare managed care contract. The PBP
   will standardize the method whereby HCFA collects information from
   plans. Additionally, the PBP will be used to generate the standardized
   Summary of Benefits. The HCFA will provide the information in the
   standardized Summary of Benefits on the Medicare.gov web site. The HCFA
   is also requiring that remaining beneficiary notification (as opposed
   to advertising) materials (e.g. Evidence of Coverage, enrollment
   application forms, appeals-related materials) be standardized. The

   Orthotic Devices Report Number: OEI-02-99-00120 Final Report: 3/00
   Finding In a previous OIG inspection, we found that inappropriate
   Medicare reimbursement for orthotics continues at significant levels.
   Thirty percent of beneficiaries have one or more miscoded orthotic
   devices. We also found that qualifications of orthotic suppliers vary,
   with non-certified suppliers being most likely to provide inappropriate
   devices. Current Law/Policy Medicare pays for orthotic devices which
   are defined by regulation as leg, arm, back, and neck braces and
   artificial legs, arms, and eyes, including replacements if required
   because of a change in the beneficiary's physical condition. Orthotic
   devices, which are mainly covered under Medicare Part B, must be
   reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness
   or injury or to improve a malformed body member. Recommendation o o
   Legislative Administrative o o Material Weakness We recommend that HCFA
   take action to improve Medicare billing for orthotic devices. Options
   we suggest include (1) requiring suppliers to maintain a description of
   how custom fabricated and molded devices are made, (2) developing
   product classification lists for all major groups of orthotic devices,
   (3) educating the supplier community, and (4) working with the durable
   medical equipment regional carriers to strengthen the billing process
   for orthotics. In addition, we recommend that HCFA require standards
   for suppliers of custom molded and custom fabricated orthotic devices.
   Status Management Response The HCFA generally concurred with the
   recommendations. The HCFA stated that it is currently working on a
   proposed rule that would establish training requirements for fitting
   and molding fabricated devices and intends to get standards for custom
   orthotics. Given the specialized training and skills necessary for
   fitting and creating custom molded and fabricated devices, we continue
   to believe in the importance of additional standards for suppliers
   providing custom devices. With regard to the second recommendation,
   HCFA has worked with the statistical analysis durable medical equipment
   regional carriers to create a product classification list for L0430
   "Thoracic Lumbar-Sacral-Othosis." The Orange Book 2000 The Orange Book

   Number: OEI-03-96-00090 Final Report: 8/99 Finding We found that nearly
   one-quarter of oxygen Certificates of Medical Necessity (CMN) were
   inaccurate or incomplete. We also determined that 13 percent of
   beneficiaries reported never using their portable oxygen systems. In
   addition, 22 percent of sampled suppliers who billed Medicare for
   portable oxygen systems in 1996 did not provide any refills for them in
   1997. Current Law/Policy The Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carrier
   Supplier Manuals require suppliers to keep on file complete and
   accurate CMNs. Section 4552 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires
   development of specific service standards for home oxygen suppliers.
   Recommendation o o Legislative Administrative o o Material Weakness The
   HCFA should delay payment for oxygen equipment claims until complete
   CMNs are submitted and conduct periodic checks to ensure that original
   CMNs signed by physicians and kept on file by suppliers confirm the
   electronic versions submitted to Medicare carriers. We recommend that
   oxygen equipment be targeted for focused medical review. Finally, the
   HCFA should establish service standards for home oxygen equipment
   suppliers, as required by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and continue
   to alert physicians to the importance of their role in determining
   medical need for and utilization of home oxygen equipment. Status
   Management Response The HCFA concurs with the recommendations. The HCFA
   will make it clear to suppliers that file copy CMNs signed by
   physicians should contain all the information suppliers submit
   electronically. The HCFA will consider medical review, possibly
   focusing on portable oxygen systems. The HCFA is planning to issue
   service standards for home oxygen suppliers, and plans to continue
   physician education efforts. The Orange Book 2000 The Orange Book 2000

   Improve Review and Tracking of Managed Care Marketing Materials Report
   Number: OEI-03-98-00270 Final Report: 2/00 OEI-03-98-00271 2/00 Finding
   The goals of Medicare's National Marketing Guide for managed care --
   which were to expedite the marketing material review process, reduce
   re-submissions of material, ensure uniform review across the nation,
   and most importantly, provide beneficiaries with accurate and
   consumer-friendly marketing materials to help them make informed
   health-care choices -- were not completely met. Few marketing
   materials, which had been approved by reviewers in HCFA, were in full
   compliance with the National Marketing Guide. Also, nearly half the
   materials were not consumer-friendly. Current Law/Policy The HCFA has
   authority to establish how managed care health plans with Medicare
   contracts provide information to beneficiaries. The health plans are
   required to submit marketing materials to HCFA regional offices for
   review and approval before distribution. The Medicare Managed Care
   National Marketing Guide was issued in November 1997. It serves as an
   operational tool for managed care plans and HCFA regional offices, and
   outlines what information is required or prohibited in marketing
   materials. Recommendation o o Legislative Administrative o o Material
   Weakness We recommend that HCFA update the National Marketing Guide to
   include clarifications of requirements; ensure that model materials are
   accurate and easy to read; mandate use of standard member materials;
   develop standard review instruments; establish a quality control
   system; track marketing- material reviews consistently and uniformly;
   conduct meetings with non-complying health plans; and provide training
   for HCFA reviewers and managed care plans. Status Management Response
   The HCFA is updating the National Marketing Guide, and adding
   checklists and model letters. As of contract year 2000, health plans
   contracting with HCFA must use a standardized Summary of Benefits. The
   agency is planning to use the Plan Benefit Package as a standardized
   way to collect descriptions of benefits from health plans and to review
   marketing materials. The HCFA has also established a quality control
   system in a pilot study and will require that all HCFA regional offices
   track receipt and approval of all marketing materials. The Orange Book

   103 Health Care Financing Prevent Payments for Services After Date of
   Death Report Number: OEI-03-99-00200 Final Report: 3/00 Finding
   Medicare paid $20.6 million in 1997 for services that started after a
   beneficiary's date of death. In many cases (totaling $12.6 million)
   Medicare had not yet received the date of death information at the time
   the claim was processed. In other cases (totaling $8 million), the date
   of death was posted in the Medicare system at the time Medicare paid
   for the service. We found that Medicare does not have uniform post-
   payment procedures to identify and recover payments for deceased
   beneficiaries. Current Law/Policy The HCFA's Common Working File (CWF),
   which is queried by contractors before payment is made, receives
   updated beneficiary information, including the date of death, from
   HCFA's Enrollment Database on a daily basis. The data contained in the
   Enrollment Database is received daily from the Social Security
   Administration and approximately three times a week from the Railroad
   Retirement Board. Recommendation o o Legislative Administrative o o
   Material Weakness The HCFA should require Medicare contractors to
   conduct annual post-payment reviews to identify and recover payments
   for services after the date of death. In addition, HCFA should revise
   its CWF system edit to ensure that durable medical equipment payments
   are not made for deceased beneficiaries. Finally, HCFA should
   periodically reconcile date of death information between the Enrollment
   Database and the CWF system. Status Management Response The HCFA
   concurred with the recommendations. The HCFA's analysis of the problem
   has been shared with all HCFA regional offices and Medicare
   contractors. During the FY 1999 benefit integrity conferences, all
   Medicare contractors were asked to perform similar analysis through
   their "proactive data analysis" efforts. Also, as an initial step to
   further study the problem, HCFA has funded pilot "deceased beneficiary"
   projects under Operation Restore Trust for a subset of the Medicare
   contractors. As appropriate, fraud referrals will be made to the OIG.
   To date, $4,913,505 in improper payments have been identified for
   recoupment, with $1,123,723 being recovered thus far. In addition, HCFA
   had initially planned to issue contractor instructions through its
   budget performance requirements for Fiscal Year 2001, requiring all
   Medicare contractors to perform these reviews. However, instructions
   will now be issued via a new program memorandum. The HCFA has also
   established the requirements for the system change necessary to revise
   CWF edits to prevent payment of durable medical equipment services
   billed after the beneficiary's date of death. The edits will be
   implemented in the January 2001 systems release. The Orange Book 2000

   Health Care Financing Improve HCFA Management of Provider-Based
   Reimbursement to Hospitals Report Number: OEI-04-97-00090 Final Report:
   8/00 Finding The HCFA regional offices use different processes and
   standards, and require varying levels of documentation for approving
   provider-based status for hospital owned entities. In addition, HCFA
   data systems are inadequate for furnishing any information regarding
   provider-based status. Hospitals often assume provider-based status for
   their off-site entities and bill Medicare without HCFA approval.
   Current Law/Policy Under Medicare, hospitals can account for medical
   entities they own as either free-standing or as part of the hospital,
   referred to as "provider-based." In order to claim provider-based
   status, hospital owned entities must request HCFA approval and meet
   criteria designed to ensure that the entity is actually part of the
   hospital. Recommendation o o Legislative Administrative o o Material
   Weakness Because of concerns about the management and increased costs
   associated with the provider-based provision, as well as an absence of
   any significant benefit to Medicare or its beneficiaries, we recommend
   that HCFA eliminate the provider-based status as an accounting option
   for all types of hospital owned entities. If HCFA chooses not to
   eliminate the use of the provider-based option, it should (1) impose
   penalties when hospitals bill Medicare for unqualified medical entities
   they own; (2) revise and clarify its program policy and procedures for
   requesting, approving, tracking, and evaluating provider-based status;
   (3) develop reliable data systems for program management; and (4)
   require that all hospitals claiming provider-based status reapply for
   that status. Status Management Response The HCFA did not concur with
   our recommendation to eliminate the provider-based program. Instead,
   HCFA has initiated various efforts to improve management of the program
   including: revising Form HCFA-855A to collect information about all
   hospital practice locations that will be billed as provider- based,
   revising regulations and procedures, implementing a new data management
   system which will furnish an indicator for any provider-based
   determination received by an enrolled or enrolling hospital, and
   provide training for staff responsible for administration and control.
   The HCFA plans to assess existing entities that currently claim
   provider-based status on a case-by-case basis. We continue to believe
   it is appropriate and well worth the additional administrative costs to
   require that all hospitals reapply for provider-based status for their
   off-site entities. The Orange Book 2000 The Orange Book 2000 HCFA

   Consolidate Medicare Administrative Appeals Report Number:
   OEI-04-97-00160 Final Report: 9/99 Finding The number of appeals being
   heard by administrative law judges (ALJ) is increasing. The non-
   adversarial process, designed for beneficiaries, is now dominated by
   providers. Except for a small cadre of ALJs who specialize in Part B
   cases, judges spend most of their time on Social Security appeals,
   leading to minimal training and experience in Medicare rules. Current
   Law/Policy The Social Security Administration manages ALJs, who hear
   both Medicare and Social Security appeals. Recommendation Legislative
   Administrative o o Material Weakness The HCFA should improve structural
   weaknesses in the appeals process by separating the beneficiary and
   provider appeal procedures, establishing an adversarial provider appeal
   process, improving contractor and ALJ training, developing regulations
   to guide Medicare appeals, and establishing a case precedent system for
   Departmental Appeals Board Rulings. The Department should consider
   consolidation of Medicare appeals either within HHS or through
   negotiation with Social Security for a dedicated Medicare ALJ corps.
   Status Management Response The HCFA concurred with our recommendations.
   The HCFA plans to issue regulations for Parts A and B appeal processes,
   including regulations allowing contractors to be represented at
   hearings. The HCFA will evaluate the possibility of a precedent system.
   Finally, HCFA supports the creation of a dedicated Medicare corps of
   ALJs, and would support housing that activity within HCFA. The Orange

   OEI-04-97-00330 Final Report: 2/00 Finding Overall, the durable medical
   equipment regional carriers (DMERCs) generally meet HCFA's objectives.
   However, one area of uncertainty is the effectiveness of their fraud
   units. Current Law/Policy On October 1, 1993, HCFA began using four
   DMERCs to process durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics,
   and supplies claims for Medicare payment. The change to the four DMERCs
   was an effort by HCFA to improve ineffective and costly claims
   processing under the 34 carrier system. Recommendation o o Legislative
   Administrative o o Material Weakness We recommend that HCFA require the
   DMERCs to maintain needed data in their automated fraud information
   systems. This data should include complete and accurate documentation
   on the sources of opened cases and detailed financial information on
   fraud cases in overpayment status. Status Management Response The HCFA
   concurred with our recommendation and is currently developing a Program
   Integrity Management Reporting System which will require Medicare
   contractors to report data on fraud and abuse overpayment status. The
   new system is scheduled for implementation spring 2001. The Orange Book

   103 Health Care Financing Improve Medicaid Mental Health Programs
   Report Number: OEI-04-97-00340 Final Report: 1/00 Finding Managed care
   allowed States to offer more specialized and creative out-patient
   services. States indicated that overall use of mental health services
   increased. Costs were reduced, although some concern was expressed that
   lower average length of stays and increased readmission rates may
   indicate that persons with serious mental illnesses are being released
   from in-patient care too quickly. Although costs were reduced, no State
   had working outcome measures in place; therefore, the overall effect on
   the health of persons with serious mental illness was not quantified.
   Savings were not always used to improve mental health services. Savings
   were sometimes used to expand services to non-Medicaid eligible persons
   and to help fund managed care administration, in some cases, even when
   some of the States did not have the appropriate Medicaid waiver to use
   operational savings in this manner. Current Law/Policy States are
   increasingly converting their Medicaid programs from traditional
   fee-for-service models to managed care models. Nearly every State has
   implemented, or is planning to implement, mandatory managed care for
   Medicaid beneficiaries who require mental health services.
   Recommendation o o Legislative Administrative o o Material Weakness The
   HCFA should work with SAMHSA to develop and implement outcome
   measurement systems that can be used as a condition of waiver approval.
   The HCFA should encourage States to establish independent, third-party
   mental health systems for conducting beneficiary satisfaction surveys
   to promote more open and honest feedback from consumers. Lastly, before
   allowing the States to use savings that have resulted from managed care
   operations, HCFA should ensure that States obtain the required 1115
   waiver to expand services to non-Medicaid populations. Status
   Management Response The HCFA indicated that HHS, along with other
   Federal and State agencies and private sector researchers, is working
   to develop valid, reliable, and cost-effective outcome measurements. As
   soon as criteria is available, HCFA will work with States to ensure
   that appropriate measurements for mental health services are utilized.
   The HCFA indicated that the managed care regulations required by the
   Balanced Budget Act of 1997, once published, will strengthen the
   requirements for a grievance process and keep in place the statutory
   requirements for a State's fair hearing process. The HCFA agreed that
   States should be encouraged to improve their systems for measuring and
   promoting beneficiary satisfaction but failed to document specific
   action toward this end. The HCFA disagreed with the final
   recommendation indicating that the "recommendation was based on an
   incorrect understanding of the statute;" therefore, HCFA specified no
   action. The SAMHSA generally was not in agreement with the study
   methodology and, therefore, did not view the findings as very
   conclusive. The Orange Book 2000 The Orange Book 2000 HCFA

   Improve Access to and Coordination of Children's Mental Health Services
   Report Number: OEI-04-97-00344 Final Report: 1/00 Finding Providing
   mental health services to children with serious emotional disturbances
   can present unique challenges not typically found when delivering
   services to adults. These challenges are generally systemic in nature
   and have existed for years under traditional fee-for-service care.
   Access to children's care is limited in three ways: (1) reduction of
   in-patient care for children was greater than for adults, (2)
   children's out-patient services lag behind those for adults, and (3)
   first year managed care contracts include limited provisions for
   children. Responsibility for care was fragmented with multiple agencies
   having responsibility. Concern was expressed about possible cost
   shifting. Lastly, States did attempt to improve coordination and access
   by negotiating interagency agreements. Reportedly, this resulted in
   improved coordination, but access to care by children is still limited.
   Current Law/Policy States are increasingly converting their Medicaid
   programs from traditional fee-for-service models to managed care
   models. Nearly every State has implemented, or is planning to implement
   mandatory managed care for Medicaid beneficiaries who require mental
   health services. These mandatory managed care contracts typically
   include services for both adults and children. Recommendation o o
   Legislative Administrative o o Material Weakness The HCFA should
   specify services for children's mental health care in managed care
   contracts. This action would help ensure children receive the
   specialized care they require. The HCFA should also develop interagency
   agreements to promote coordination of children's mental health
   services. This action could result in reduced cost shifting concerns
   between agencies and better coordinated services. Status Management
   Response The HCFA will emphasize to States the importance of managed
   care contracts defining clearly what mental health services must be
   provided to enrolled children. The HCFA has prepared draft Interim
   Review Criteria for Children with Special Needs and States who
   mandatorily enroll children in capitated plans will respond to these
   criteria as part of their waiver. In regards to the second
   recommendation, HCFA plans to highlight the importance of effective
   State-level coordination of all services to special needs populations
   in their imminent Report to Congress on the special needs of vulnerable
   populations enrolled in Medicaid managed care. The Orange Book 2000 The

   Health Care Financing Identify and Monitor Hospital Ownership of
   Physician Practices Report Number: OEI-05-98-00110 Final Report: 9/99
   Finding While hospitals are purchasing physician practices in
   significant numbers, HCFA is frequently unaware of hospital ownership
   of physician practices. Its lack of knowledge presents a fiscal
   vulnerability to the Medicare program and beneficiaries. The HCFA
   efforts to address the problem may not go far enough. Current
   Law/Policy The HCFA policy is that a hospital may choose to treat a
   hospital owned physician practice as either provider-based or
   free-standing. This decision will affect the amount of payment received
   by the hospital for physician services rendered in the practice. The
   decision to treat an acquired physician practice as provider-based
   increases costs to both the Medicare program and beneficiaries.
   Recommendation Legislative Administrative o o Material Weakness The
   HCFA should change its policy and eliminate the provider-based
   designation for hospital owned physician practices and instead treat
   all purchased practices as free-standing entities. In addition, HCFA
   should require hospitals to report all purchases of physician practices
   and declare how costs associated with these entities are handled on the
   cost report. Finally, we recommend that HCFA seek legislation to be
   able to sanction hospitals for failure to report the ownership of
   physician practices. Status Management Response The HCFA did not concur
   with our recommendation to eliminate the provider-based designation for
   hospital owned physician practices, but did concur with our other
   recommendations. The provider-based rules recently published by HCFA
   require that HCFA determine that an entity meets the criteria for
   establishing provider-based status. The Orange Book 2000 The Orange

   Financing Improve Enrollment in the Children's Health Insurance Program
   Report Number: OEI-05-98-00310 Final Report: 5/99 Finding Many States
   are experimenting with a variety of application and enrollment
   practices and processes in the State Children's Health Insurance
   Program (SCHIP) such as, application brevity, joint applications,
   multi- program applications, and written materials in other languages.
   People involved in the SCHIP application process stated that fear of
   being detected makes illegal aliens reluctant to complete an
   application, even for their children who meet citizenship requirements;
   Medicaid, SCHIP and other public benefit programs differ in their rules
   regarding verification of alien status, child support enforcement, and
   verification of income. Current Law/Policy The Balanced Budget Act of
   1997 created Title XXI of the Social Security Act, the State Children's
   Health Insurance Program. Title XXI provides $39 billion over 10 years
   to develop health insurance programs for low-income children. States
   have the option to expand their existing Medicaid program, design a new
   children's health insurance program or develop a program that combines
   these strategies. Studies have shown that applications and enrollment
   procedures may be a barrier to families applying for Medicaid. Reducing
   the length and complexity of Medicaid and SCHIP applications may
   improve the uptake rate for eligible children. Researchers, advocacy
   groups, and HCFA are encouraging States to streamline Title XXI
   applications and the application process. Recommendation o o
   Legislative Administrative o o Material Weakness We recommend that HCFA
   work with States to improve the readability of SCHIP applications. We
   also recommend that HCFA continue to encourage States to simplify their
   applications and enrollment processes for SCHIP and Medicaid. We
   encourage HCFA to continue helping States investigate contracting with
   enrollment brokers, and eliminate some verification requirements.
   Status Management Response The HCFA concurred with our recommendations.
   They highlighted their ongoing efforts in providing technical
   assistance to States on simplifying enrollment procedures. The HCFA is
   continuing to improve their outreach efforts by collaborating with HRSA
   and instituting a series of Technical Advisory Panels. The HCFA also
   worked with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to develop and
   release a policy guidance on the "public charge" issue. The Orange Book

   Care Report Number: OEI-06-90-00160 Final Report: 2/92 Finding
   Significant problems prevent newly eligible women from receiving
   Medicaid-covered prenatal care: (1) client outreach is inadequate and
   (2) women are not completing the cumbersome application process.
   Current Law/Policy States are mandated to set income eligibility at 133
   percent of the Federal Poverty Level; guarantee continuous eligibility
   until 60 days post partum; extend the presumptive eligibility period up
   to 60 days for States choosing this option; use special
   pregnancy-related application forms; use application sites other than
   where Aid to Families with Dependent Children applications are
   processed; and eliminate paternity establishment as a precondition to
   receive Medicaid-covered prenatal care. Recommendation o o Legislative
   Administrative o o Material Weakness The HCFA should: (1) develop a
   comprehensive outreach strategy, and (2) simplify and streamline the
   application process. Status Management Response The HCFA concurred and
   agreed to continue to work with PHS, ACF, and State Medicaid Directors.
   Due to the new Welfare Reform and States opting to enroll Medicaid
   recipients into managed care programs, outreach strategies have
   increased. Many States have developed strategies targeted to provide
   continuous eligibility to pregnant women. States are also simplifying
   and streamlining application forms to alleviate administrative burdens
   and expedite the process. The Orange Book 2000 The Orange Book 2000

   (Continued 2) Report Number: OEI-06-90-00160 Final Report: 2/92 Finding
   In evaluating Medicaid expansions for prenatal care, the OIG found
   that: (1) States have difficulty recruiting prenatal care providers.
   There is a shortage of obstetricians to deliver adequate care. (2)
   States need more timely information and training from HCFA. (3) The
   HCFA and most States cannot measure the progress and impact of
   expansions due to lack of centralized data. Current Law/Policy States
   are mandated to set income eligibility at 133 percent of the Federal
   Poverty Level; guarantee continuous eligibility until 60 days post
   partum; extend the presumptive eligibility period up to 60 days for
   States choosing this option; use special pregnancy-related application
   forms; use application sites other than where Aid to Families with
   Dependent Children applications are processed; and eliminate paternity
   establishment as a precondition to receive Medicaid-covered prenatal
   care. Congressional concern about the health status of pregnant women
   has led to significant Federal and State Medicaid eligibility
   expansions. Recommendation o o Legislative Administrative o o Material
   Weakness The HCFA should: (1) develop incentives to increase provider
   participation; (2) clarify policy and monitor implementation of
   Medicaid expansions for prenatal care; and (3) develop data collection
   systems and evaluation processes to measure progress of the eligibility
   expansions and future program effects. Status Management Response The
   Balanced Budget Act of 1997 repealed Section 1926 of prior law, which
   contained requirements that States assure adequate Medicaid payment
   levels for obstetrical and pediatric services. The HCFA works closely
   with State Medicaid Directors, informs States of legislative options
   and mandates and conducts local site visits on an ongoing basis. The
   Medicaid Maternal and Child Health Technical Assistance Group discusses
   areas where technical assistance is needed and plans for action to
   resolve those difficulties on a regular basis. The Orange Book 2000 The

   Health Care Financing Identify Primary Health Insurance: Medicare
   Secondary Payer Auxiliary File Report Number: OEI-07-98-00180 Final
   Report: 6/00 Finding Only 0.43 percent of the beneficiaries in our
   sample who had primary health insurance coverage were not identified by
   Medicare. Based on improper payments made to these individuals, we
   estimated that the Medicare program inappropriately paid $56 million in
   1997. These estimates only pertained to the 20 million Medicare
   beneficiaries in HCFA's Medicare secondary payer data system. Current
   Law/Policy Medicare provides health insurance coverage for eligible
   beneficiaries, but is not always the primary insurer. For example,
   Medicare is secondary for certain working-aged individuals and their
   spouses who have health insurance through their employer and certain
   working beneficiaries who qualify for Medicare based on disability and
   end-stage-renal disease. In addition, Medicare can be secondary to
   coverage under an automobile, no-fault, liability insurance, or
   workers' compensation plan. Recommendation o o Legislative
   Administrative o o Material Weakness The HCFA should emphasize to
   providers the importance of reporting timely employment and health
   insurance information. In addition, HCFA should take steps to increase
   response rates for the initial enrollment questionnaire (IEQ). Status
   Management Response The HCFA indicated that work has been initiated
   with the Coordination of Benefits contractor, which will emphasize to
   providers the requirement to obtain employment and health insurance
   information during each beneficiary visit. The HCFA agreed with the
   intent of the recommendation to increase the response rate for the IEQ
   but did not agree to any of the options outlined in the report. The

   Physician Identification Number Data Report Number: OEI-07-98-00410
   Final Report: 9/99 Finding While HCFA has implemented a number of
   enhancements which have improved unique physician identification number
   (UPIN) and provider identification number (PIN) data, some problems
   remain. Twenty-three percent of active UPINs and 39 percent of PINs
   have had no claims activity in the last year. Coding instructions
   create inconsistent entry of State license numbers, professional school
   codes, physician specialty, and board certification. A small subset of
   providers have more than 10 PINs associated with a single UPIN.
   Finally, some data fields are inconsistent between UPIN and PIN records
   for the same physician. Current Law/Policy The HCFA instructs carriers
   to deactivate the PIN after 12 consecutive months with no Medicare
   claims. The UPINs are deactivated when all associated PINs have been
   inactive for 12 months. State license numbers should be right justified
   and preceded with zeros. Recommendation o o Legislative o o
   Administrative o o Material Weakness The HCFA should ensure that
   carriers deactivate PINs and UPINs according to policy by including
   this activity in the Carrier Performance Evaluation review. State
   license numbers should be entered exactly as shown on State records,
   including characters, numbers, and spaces. The numbers should be left
   justified to enhance consistency. Individuals with large numbers of
   associated PINs should be a high review priority. The HCFA should
   reconcile identical data fields between UPIN and all associated PINs
   before implementing the national provider identification initiative.
   Status Management Response The HCFA concurs with the report
   recommendations. Specifically, the HCFA agrees that Carrier Performance
   Evaluation should include deactivation of UPINs and PINs according to
   policy. The HCFA plans to release additional instructions for coding
   and data entry. The HCFA is implementing the Reassignment, Threshold
   Project, Physician Enrollment Chain and Ownership System, and address
   validation on the UPIN files, all of which address providers with
   multiple PINs. The HCFA plans to release additional instructions to
   carriers to deactivate the PINs within 6 consecutive months with no
   Medicare claims. The Orange Book 2000 The Orange Book 2000 HCFA

   Improve Physician's Role in Home Health Care Report Number:
   OEI-02-94-00170 Final Report: 6/95 Finding Agencies and physicians
   identify some obstacles and issues related to the physician role.
   Obstacles mentioned by respondents include: (1) sixty-five percent of
   agencies and 51 percent of physician respondents find the process of
   reviewing and signing plans of care burdensome; (2) physicians find it
   difficult to find important information on the plan of care; and (3)
   some agencies feel physician awareness and education in home health is
   inadequate and that they lack an understanding of the home health
   benefit. Current Law/Policy Medicare home health agency regulations
   require physicians to sign a plan of care specifying all services the
   patient is to receive. This certification must be updated every 60
   days, but the doctor is not required to see the patient. Recommendation
   o o Legislative Administrative o o Material Weakness The HCFA should
   continue its efforts to change the plan of care to ensure it conveys
   critical information to caregivers and relieves unnecessary burden from
   physicians. The HCFA should strengthen its efforts to educate both
   agencies and physicians about its policies regarding the physician's
   role in home health care. Status Management Response The HCFA has
   proposed revised conditions of participation for care planning and
   coordination of services. Specifically, the revisions would decrease
   the burden of home health agencies and would allow agency staff to
   develop care plans in coordination with the physician. The NPRM was
   published on March 10, 1997. Public comments were received and
   revisions to the regulation are in progress. The final rule is targeted
   for publication by the end of Calendar Year 2000. The HCFA also plans
   to issue new billing instructions for carriers to install new edits and
   conduct provider education. The Orange Book 2000 The Orange Book 2000

   Strengthen Education of Contractual Relationships Between Hospices and
   Nursing Homes Report Number: OEI-05-95-00251 Final Report: 11/97
   Finding We found that some hospice contracts with nursing homes contain
   provisions that raise questions about inappropriate patient referrals
   between hospices and nursing homes. Current Law/Policy Hospice care is
   a treatment approach which recognizes that the impeding death of an
   individual warrants a change focus from a curative to palliative care.
   The Medicare hospice benefit program began in 1983 and was expended in
   1986 to cover individuals residing in nursing facilities. To qualify, a
   patient must be certified as terminally ill with a life expectancy of 6
   months or less if the illness runs its normal course. Recommendation o
   o Legislative Administrative o o Material Weakness We recommend that
   HCFA work with the hospice associations to educate the hospice and
   nursing home communities to help them avoid potentially fraudulent and
   abusive activities that might influence decisions on patient benefit
   choices and care. Status Management Response The HCFA concurred with
   our recommendation. The HCFA staff, their contractors, and the regional
   home health intermediaries (RHHIs), are working together with the
   national and local hospice associations to educate them regarding
   potentially fraudulent and abusive activities. The RHHIs have been
   instructed to conduct educational seminars for providers, physicians,
   and/or consumers. The HCFA will also continue to encourage the RHHIs to
   re-emphasize the potential fraudulent and abusive activities in their
   continuing educational efforts. The HCFA is currently working on a
   notice of proposed rulemaking for the hospice conditions of
   participation. The Orange Book 2000 The Orange Book 2000 Hospices Page

   Investigation and Resolution of Patient Dumping Complaints Report
   Number: OAS-06-93-00087 Final Report: 4/95 Finding We assessed HCFA's
   effectiveness in investigating and resolving complaints involving
   potential violations of the Examination and Treatment for Emergency
   Medical Conditions and Women in Labor Act. We found that HCFA regional
   offices were not always consistent in (1) conducting timely
   investigations of patient dumping complaints, (2) sending
   acknowledgements to complainants, (3) ensuring that provisions of the
   Act were addressed in substantiating violations, or (4) ensuring that
   violations were referred to the OIG for consideration of civil monetary
   penalties. Current Law/Policy Section 1867 of the Social Security Act,
   "Examination and Treatment for Emergency Medical Conditions and Women
   in Labor," prohibits patient dumping. Recommendation o o Legislative
   Administrative o o Material Weakness We recommend that HCFA amend its
   guidelines to the regional offices, conduct training on the
   requirements concerning patient dumping, ensure that all regional
   offices follow established procedures, and improve its process for
   referring cases to the OIG. Status Management Response The HCFA
   concurred with our findings and recommendations. The Orange Book 2000

   OEI-03-98-00560 12/98 Finding The diagnosis related group (DRG) system
   is vulnerable to abuse by providers who wish to increase reimbursement
   inappropriately through upcoding, particularly within certain DRGs. We
   identified a small number of hospitals that have atypically high
   billings for DRGs 416, 296, and 475, but found that HCFA performs no
   such routine, ongoing analysis of hospital billing data to detect
   possible problems in DRG coding. Current Law/Policy Under Medicare's
   prospective payment system reimbursement formula for inpatient
   services, the payment a hospital receives is based upon an individual
   hospital's payment rate and the weight of the DRG to which a case is
   assigned. Since 1995, HCFA has used two specialized contractors called
   Clinical Data Abstraction Centers to validate the DRGs on an annual
   national sample of over 20,000 claims billed to Medicare. This
   validation provides HCFA with an overall assessment of DRG coding.
   Recommendation o o Legislative Administrative o o Material Weakness The
   HCFA should perform routine monitoring and analysis of hospital billing
   data and clinical data to proactively identify aberrant patterns of
   upcoding. This analysis should include identification of hospitals with
   atypically high billings for DRGs. Status Management Response The HCFA
   concurred with our recommendation. The HCFA stated that peer review
   organization (PRO) contracts will conduct a Payment Error Prevention
   Program for inpatient hospital care. Under this approach, HCFA will
   conduct an independent ongoing surveillance of inpatient payment error
   rates, both nationally and on a State-by-State basis. The HCFA will
   also conduct analyses of discharge patterns and provide the results to
   the PROs. The PROs will conduct additional analyses of discharge
   patterns and take steps to reduce or eliminate erroneous billing. By
   Calendar Year 2000 end, HCFA anticipates having initial State-by-State
   surveillance data. The Orange Book 2000 The Orange Book 2000 Hospitals

   Quality Review of Psychiatric Hospitals Report Number: OEI-01-99-00160
   Final Report: 5/00 Finding The current system of external review has
   some strengths that help protect patients but, it also has major
   deficiencies. We found that some psychiatric hospitals are rarely
   subjected to either a contracted or State agency review and that HCFA's
   contracted surveyors are held minimally accountable for their
   performance in overseeing psychiatric hospitals. Current Law/Policy
   Medicare requires psychiatric hospitals to meet two special conditions
   of participation - staff requirements and medical records - that apply
   only to psychiatric hospitals. The HCFA relies upon contracted
   psychiatric nurses and psychiatrists to assess compliance with these
   two special conditions. Additionally, like general hospitals,
   psychiatric hospitals are also subject to all Medicare conditions of
   participation (CoP) including the new "patients rights" CoP and can be
   deemed to meet them through either accreditation, usually by the Joint
   Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), or
   certification by State agencies. Recommendation o o Legislative
   Administrative o o Material Weakness The HCFA should deploy its
   contracted surveyors more strategically, to take better advantage of
   their expertise and hold them more accountable. The HCFA should also
   establish a minimum cycle for contracted psychiatric surveys; negotiate
   with JCAHO to achieve a more patient-centered approach and a more
   rigorous assessment of discharge planning; and consider applying
   special Medicare CoP to both psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric
   units at acute care hospitals. Status Management Response The HCFA is
   conducting observational performance reviews of its contracted
   surveyors and is in the process of designing a performance based
   evaluation system for them which they intend to put in place during FY
   2001. As a result of new funding, HCFA anticipates reducing the
   interval between surveys to 3 years. The HCFA will continue to pursue
   additional funding for this function. The HCFA is currently negotiating
   with JCAHO to strengthen their standards and survey process in
   evaluating psychiatric services and assessing discharge planning. The
   HCFA intends to develop interpretive guidance for reviewers of
   psychiatric units in acute care hospitals to more rigorously implement
   existing requirements for exclusion from the prospective payment system
   that are found at 42 CFR 412.27. These requirements generally parallel
   the two special conditions of participation required for psychiatric
   hospitals. The HCFA also plans to use the contracted surveyors to
   supplement State agency reviewers. The Orange Book 2000 The Orange Book

   OAS-17-97-00097 4/98 OAS-17-98-00098 2/99 OAS-17-00-00500 2/00 Finding
   Our audit of HCFA's FY 1999 financial statements found that significant
   financial management issues still affect HCFA's ability to accumulate
   and analyze Medicare accounts receivable, which had a $4.2 billion
   balance. During FY 1999, HCFA improved its accountability for accounts
   receivable; however, balances were not routinely analyzed or monitored
   other than on a very aggregate basis, so emerging trends could go
   undetected, and activities having a material impact could not be
   readily identified. Also, the reasonableness of the allowance for
   doubtful accounts was not ascertained, and contractor controls still
   need improvement. Current Law/Policy Guidance applicable to Medicare is
   in the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 and OMB Bulletin 98-08.
   Recommendation o o Legislative Administrative Material Weakness We
   recommend that HCFA (1) maintain internal controls to ensure that
   reported accounts receivable amounts and transactions are valid and
   documented; (2) establish an integrated financial management system for
   use by Medicare contractors and HCFA
