Tools to query the I.M.A.G.E. database

     * We are proud to offer our general purpose query tool, called "IQ"
       (short for I.M.A.G.E. Query)
     * Find out which plates belong to which libraries using the cDNA
       Plate and Collection Query
     * Find out which ESTs cluster together using IMAGEne
     * Find clones with reported problems, or submit reports about clones,
       using the I.M.A.G.E. Problem Clone Database
     * Get commonly requested data about libraries using our cDNA Library
       navigator. Just choose your species here: [Human_____________] Go

  Current Stats

     * View Arrayed Clones by Library (updated daily)
     * View Arrayed Clones by Tissue (updated daily)
