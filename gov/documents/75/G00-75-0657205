   Plant Materials Program
   Louisiana's Plant Materials Program is divided into two
   initiativesÂ–coastal wetland restoration and upland conservation. The
   initiatives focus on developing new information and increasing
   landowner conservation efforts on the land using tested and proven
   conservation plants. Visit these important sites:

   Plant Materials Center

   Brown Marsh Crisis

   Publications


   "Vermilion" smooth cordgrass; Spartina alterniflora Loisel.

   Acceleration of plant materials work is helping to advance the release
   of coastal wetland species so that commercial producers, landowners,
   and conservationists may benefit from the new releases.
