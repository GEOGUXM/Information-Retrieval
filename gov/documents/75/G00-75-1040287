                   For Immediate Release November 1, 1999

   NATIONAL AMERICAN INDIAN HERITAGE MONTH, 1999 - - - - - - -

   BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

   A PROCLAMATION

   Ours is a nation inextricably linked to the histories of the many
   peoples who first inhabited this great land. Everywhere around us are
   reminders of the legacy of America's first inhabitants. Their history
   speaks to us through the names of our cities, lakes, and rivers; the
   food on our tables; the magnificent ruins of ancient communities; and,
   most important, the lives of the people who retain the cultural,
   spiritual, linguistic, and kinship bonds that have existed for
   millennia. As we reflect on the heritage of American Indians, Alaska
   Natives, and Native Hawaiians, we also reaffirm our commitment to
   fostering a prosperous future for native youth and children. At the
   foundation of these efforts is our work to provide a quality education
   to all Native American children. In particular, we have sought
   significantly increased funding to support Bureau of Indian Affairs
   school construction and 1,000 new teachers for American Indian youth.
   My 1998 Executive order on American Indian and Alaska Native Education
   sets goals to improve high school completion rates and improve
   performance in reading and mathematics. And we are working to get
   computers into every classroom and to expand the use of educational
   technology. We are also seeking ways to empower Native American
   communities and help them prosper. My Administration is expanding
   consultation and collaborative decision-making with tribal governments
   to promote self-determination. We also support tribal government
   economic development initiatives, particularly those that increase or
   enhance the infrastructure necessary for long-term economic growth. My
   New Markets Initiative seeks to leverage public and private investment
   to boost economic development in areas that have not shared in our
   recent national prosperity. In July, I visited the Pine Ridge
   Reservation of the Oglala Sioux, as part of my New Markets Tour, to
   explore opportunities for economic development in Indian Country. Among
   the most serious barriers to economic growth facing tribal communities
   is a lack of housing, physical infrastructure, and essential services.
   My Administration is working with tribal leaders to build and renovate
   affordable housing on tribal lands, bring quality drinking water to
   economically distressed Indian communities, and improve public safety.
   We are moving to assist tribal governments in developing the physical
   infrastructure needed for economic development, including roads,
   fiber-optic cabling, and electric power lines. In working together to
   shape a brighter future for Indian Country, we must not lose sight of
   the rich history of Native Americans. Just weeks ago, the Smithsonian
   Institution broke ground on the National Mall for the National Museum
   of the American Indian. This wonderful facility will preserve and
   celebrate the art, history, and culture of America's indigenous
   peoples. It is also fitting that the first U.S. dollar coin of the new
   millennium will bear the likeness of Sacajawea and her infant son -- an
   image that captures the importance of our shared history. NOW,
   THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of
   America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution
   and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 1999 as
   National American Indian Heritage Month. I urge all Americans, as well
   as their elected representatives at the Federal, State, local, and
   tribal levels, to observe this month with appropriate programs,
   ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my
   hand this first day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen
   hundred and ninety-nine, and of the Independence of the United States
   of America the two hundred and twenty-fourth. WILLIAM J. CLINTON # # #

   Nov. 5, 1999

   During November, American Indian Heritage month, it is my pleasure as
   American Indian Special Emphasis Program manager to send out to you
   what I call Notes From Native America. For those who may be new to
   this, they are short articles, historical information, and other items
   of interest having to do with Indian issues. Sometimes I may refer you
   to a website for further reading if you like. While I will not say
   these all will necessarily be through Native eyes, my hope is that you
   may begin to get a picture of our world and the things that affect us,
   our ways of life and the future of our children.

   First, a short update. Last year, I attended a Dept. of the Interior
   summit on the Tribal College Initiative, attended by federal and tribal
   representatives, dealing with methods of approaching the Executive
   Order on Tribal Colleges and Universities. I was able to return to
   Denver and work with our area Federal Executive Board group, the
   American Indian Program Council, ( www.aipc.osmre.gov) in developing a
   training seminar for Federal Employees on the Executive Order. I am
   happy to say that OSM/WRCC sent nine people to the training on Sept.
   21. There were over 140 people from diverse agencies from many
   different parts of the country, as there have been no other trainings
   on this topic.

   ****************************************

   On July 7, Bill Clinton became the first U.S. President to visit an
   Indian reservation since Franklin Roosevelt. There the President
   emphasized the importance of education in improving economic conditions
   in Indian Country, including of course, tribal colleges.

   On July 9, he announced the members he had chosen as his board of
   advisors on Tribal Colleges and Universities. Four of the members are
   part of our coal producing tribal partners, the Crow and the Navajo
   Nations.

   Ms. Janine Pease-Pretty on Top, of Crow Agency, Montana, is the
   President of Little Big Horn College. She was named Indian Educator of
   the Year by the National Indians Education Association in 1990 and
   received a MacArthur Foundation "genius" grant in 1994. Dr.
   Pease-Pretty on Top received an Ed. D. degree from Montana State
   University in 1994 and is the first Crow woman to earn a doctorate.

   Dr. Tommy Lewis, Jr., of Tsaille, Arizona, is the President of Dine
   College, the largest and oldest of the 31 Tribal Colleges in the United
   States. Prior to serving as president of Dine College, he was on the
   faculty for the Center for Excellence in Education at Northern Arizona
   University. He received B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from Northern
   Arizona University.

   Ms. Faith Ruth Roessel, is a member of the Navajo Nation. She served as
   Special Assistant to Secretary Babbitt from1995-1997, and previously
   was Deputy Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs. She serves on
   several national boards, including the Child Welfare League of America,
   Americans for Indian Opportunity, and is a former board member of the
   American Bar Association's Commission on Opportunities for Minorities
   in the Profession, during which time she also chaired the Multicultural
   Women Attorneys Network. Ms. Roessel received a B.A. degree from Fort
   Lewis College and a J.D. degree from the University of New Mexico Law
   School.

   Ms. Debora Norris, of Sells, Arizona, is one of the first two Native
   American women to serve in the Arizona House of Representatives and is
   its youngest member, currently age 27. In the Arizona legislature, she
   is a member of the Commerce, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs
   committees. Ms. Norris, a Navajo, lives on the second largest Indian
   reservation in the United States. She received a B.A. degree in history
   from Stanford University in 1993.
