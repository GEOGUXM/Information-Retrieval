   Examination

   Where can I obtain the application and information to take the CPA
   Exam?

   Examination Services (CPAES) assigns applicants to sites on a first
   come, first served basis.  All proctored candidates will be assigned to
   the Spokane site on a space-available basis.  If you dont know where
   you are scheduled to sit for the exam, contact CPAES at 1-800-CPA-EXAM

   Washington and want to take the CPA exam as a Washington State
   candidate, you will need to physically come to Washington to sit for
   the exam.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Experience

   Because of the change in the Board's experience requirements, our
   organization is establishing a process for certificateholders and
   others to meet the experience requirements to obtain a CPA license.
   Must our files contain specific documentation supporting achievement of
   each competency, what type of documentation is required to support work
   done in prior years, and what type of documentation would be
   acceptable?

   The supporting information and documentation does not need to support
   whether a specific competency was achieved.  However, the candidate's
   experience must have been in specific skill areas (accounting, issuing
   reports on financial statements, tax, tax advisory, management
   advisory, financial advisory, consulting skills) that support the
   attainment of the seven competencies.

   The Board does not wish the experience verification process to create
   unnecessary or onerous documentation requirements for those licensed
   CPAs verifying a candidate's experience.
   When licensed CPAs are considering individuals who obtained their
   experience over many years, the Board recommends that the verifying
   CPA:
     * Recommendation #1 - Supporting information could include such
       information as: employment records, confirmations of work
       experience from former employers, supervisory, or peer employees;
       performance appraisals, discussion notes from meetings with the
       verifying CPA, interview documents, work plans, Continuing
       Professional Education (CPE) records, or any other documents that
       could be used to support the validity of the representations made
       on the Experience Affidavit. The burden of proof of the validity of
       the Experience Affidavit is on the candidate.
     * Recommendation #2 - Briefly note or define the work experience the
       verifying CPA considered when making the decision to state that the
       candidate obtained experience that supported the attainment of the
       competencies
     * Recommendation #3 - Briefly note or define the process the
       verifying CPA undertook to consider the candidate's past work
       experience (for example:  discussions/inquiries of candidate's work
       supervisor(s) or peers; interviews with the candidate; actual
       knowledge of the candidate's work; confirmation of the candidate's
       employment, etc).  The Board does not foresee verifying CPAs and/or
       candidates having specific or detailed work documents exhibiting
       the performance of assignments supporting each specific competency
       or ability.  Rather, the Board anticipates the verifying CPA will
       develop an understanding of the candidate's experience through
       knowledge of the candidate's work, conversations/interviews with
       the candidate, conversations with the candidate's current and past
       supervisors and peers, or other methods as the verifying CPA may
       determine appropriate.
     * Recommendation #4 - Have frequent in-person meetings with the
       candidate during the assessment period which may be a different
       time period than the experience period.

   I am a licensed CPA.  I have been asked to verify a candidate's
   experience.  Am I required to do this?

   As in the past, the decision to verify a candidate's experience is a
   personal and business decision to be made by the licensed CPA.

   Is the verifying CPA required to verify that the candidate attained the
   competencies?

   No.  The verifying CPA verifies that the candidate has had experience
   supporting the attainment of the competencies by completing Section 1
   of the Experience Affidavit.  The verifying CPA does not verify that
   the candidate has attained the competencies.

   Can I have more than one licensed CPA verify my experience?

   Yes, each CPA verifying your experience must complete Section 1 of the
   form.

   Must the licensed CPA who verifies my experience be my current or past
   work supervisor?

   No.

   Must the licensed CPA who verifies my experience work for the same
   organization I work for?

   No.

   Must the licensed CPA who verifies my experience currently be employed
   in public practice?

   No.

   Must the licensed CPA who verifies my experience currently be employed?

   No.

   Can the 2,000 required hours of experience include volunteer work
   and/or work that I was not paid for?

   Yes.

   What kind of hours qualify for the experience requirement?

   The candidate's experience must be for a minimum of 12 months,
   consisting of at least 2,000 hours, through the use of accounting,
   issuing reports on financial statements, management advisory, financial
   advisory, tax, tax advisory or consulting skills. The 2,000 hours are
   work hours; i.e., the hours are not limited to billable hours. Nor are
   the 2,000 hours limited to hours for which the candidate received a
   wage or salary. These hours can include volunteer work and overtime
   hours.

   Must the verifying CPA hold a Washington State CPA License?

   No.  However, in order to sign the Experience Affidavit the verifying
   CPA must:
     * Currently hold a valid CPA license in one of the 54 US
       jurisdictions, and
     * Have held a CPA license for a 5-year period; however those five
       years do not have to be continuous.

   Can a Chartered Accountant verify my experience?

   No, in order to sign the Experience Affidavit the verifying CPA must:
     * Currently hold a valid CPA license in one of the 54 US
       jurisdictions, and
     * Have held a CPA license for a 5 year period; however those five
       years do not have to be continuous

   Our firm has multiple CPA managers.  Who should sign the Experience
   Affidavit?

   Any licensed CPA may verify a candidate's experience provided the
   verifying CPA:
     * Currently holds a valid CPA license in one of the 54 US
       jurisdictions, and
     * Held a CPA license for a 5 year period; however those five years do
       not have to be continuous

   Do I have to work at one organization for the entire 2,000 hour period?

   No.  Candidates may use experience from one or several organizations.

   Can I pay a licensed CPA to verify that I had experience supporting the
   attainment of the competencies?

   Yes.

   I am a certificateholder and, provided I apply for a license by
   June 30, 2004, I can use experience obtained throughout my lifetime.
   The individual verifying my experience is a licensed CPA that I have
   been associated with for the last month.  We are reviewing my work
   experience which includes experience that I obtained between 2 and 15
   years ago from working at a variety of organizations.  Can the CPA
   verify my experience even though we have been associated for only one
   month?

   Yes.  The assessment period may be shorter than the experience period
   and the assessment period may occur at a different time than the
   experience period.

   I am a certificateholder and, provided I apply for a license by
   June 30, 2004, I can use experience obtained throughout my lifetime.
   My supervisor is a licensed CPA that I have been associated with over
   the last 20 years and she has agreed to work with me to verify my
   experience.  My supervisor and I are reviewing my work experience that
   includes experience I obtained 20 years ago while working at Company
   B.
   My supervisor did not work at Company B; however, she was very familiar
   with my work through a business relationship between Company B and her
   firm.  Can the CPA verify my experience even though she has not been my
   supervisor for the entire period?

   Yes.  The assessment period may be shorter than the experience period
   and the assessment period may occur at a different time than the
   experience period.

   Can my experience in a private company be accepted for a license?

   Yes.  See the Board's
   Policy 2001-2 for complete information on how to obtain your experience
   in industry, academia, or government.

   Can my experience from a firm outside of the United States be
   used to satisfy the experience requirements?

   Yes.  See the Board's
   Policy 2001-2 for complete information on how to obtain your experience
   in a firm outside of the United States.

   I completed about 600 hours of work in public practice and  I just got
   a job with a government audit organization where I plan to complete my
   experience.  How do I document my experience?

   You must establish a relationship with a licensed CPA willing to verify
   your experience.  The licensed CPA does not have to be your work
   supervisor; nor does the licensed CPA have to work for the same
   organization that you currently work for or previously worked for.  The
   licensed CPA must verify (by completing Section 1 of the Experience
   Affidavit) that you obtained experience that supported your attainment
   of the competencies.  You must complete Section 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) of
   an
   Experience Affidavit confirming that you had experience in the required
   skill areas supporting your attainment of the identified
   competencies/abilities.  Both your public accounting work experience
   and your experience with the governmental audit organization can be
   utilized towards the 2,000 hour requirement.

   I have held a Washington CPA license since 1979.  I am the chief
   financial officer for Company X and I have interviewed an individual
   for the position of accounting manager.  The accounting manager will be
   supervised by me directly and will be responsible for all aspects of
   the entity's accounting functions, including accounts receivable and
   payable, payroll, general ledger, financial statement preparation,
   banking, and finance and insurance functions. Would this position
   qualify for the 2000 hour experience requirement for the CPA license?
   Is there a process to get Board pre-approval of this position as
   qualifying for experience meeting the Board's requirements?

   The Board does not approve specific positions as providing experience
   qualifying for licensure.  However, the Experience Affidavit is set up
   in a manner that will assist you, as the verifying CPA, and the
   candidate in your decision as to whether or not the position has the
   potential for providing the type of experience the candidate needs in
   order to meet the Board's experience requirement. If you elect to work
   with an individual and verify their experience, you will need to verify
   that the individual obtained experience that would have supported their
   attainment of the seven competencies. As the individual's direct
   supervisor it would appear you would be in an excellent position to
   make that determination.  As you work with the individual you may
   identify areas where additional experience (that cannot be obtained in
   the accounting manager position) may be necessary. Ideally, you should
   support the individual in locating supplementary experience to ensure
   the candidate has work experience supporting the candidate's attainment
   of all seven competencies.

   Is the verifying CPA required to provide a written explanation of the
   candidate's knowledge, competency, and/or experience?

   No.  The verifying CPA must complete Section 1 of the Experience
   Affidavit verifying that the candidate has had experience supporting
   the candidate's attainment of the competencies.

   How can a candidate in a non CPA firm attain Competency 1:
   Understanding the Profession's Code of Conduct?

   The Board believes all candidates must demonstrate the understanding of
   this core principle found both in state law and in the professions code
   of conduct.  The Board also feels this principle, so key to the
   profession and its clients, is communicated and displayed in a broad
   spectrum of organizations, entities, and practices.  Additionally, the
   verifying CPA may aid the candidate in locating opportunities in other
   organizations which provide additional experience supporting the
   attainment of this competency.

   How can a candidate employed in a mature company attain Ability 3.1:
   Understanding of entity's internal controls is obtained and considered
   in determining the scope of the work program or services to be
   performed?

   The Board suggests the verifying CPA and the candidate review
   professional standards to obtain guidance in this area.  Included
   within the Experience Affidavit instructions is a matrix tying the
   seven core competencies to professional standards. This matrix will
   provide guidance on which standards support the candidate's required
   work experience..

   Ability 5.1 - Assess control risk for various accounts, assertions, or
   programs, etc. is difficult to understand.  What is the Board
   specifically looking for?

   The Board anticipates candidates will work with a variety of reporting
   standards which could include generally accepted auditing standards,
   standards for attestation engagements, SEC reporting standards, other
   federal reporting standards, other professional standards, internal
   reporting standards, etc.  The Board intends verifying CPAs and
   candidates include a broad scope of standards and projects when
   considering this and other abilities.

   Can knowledge obtained from continuing professional education (CPE) be
   considered when evaluating attainment of the competencies/abilities?

   Yes; however, that knowledge must be combined with experience in
   specific skill areas (accounting, issuing reports on financial
   statements, tax, tax advisory, management advisory, financial advisory,
   and consulting skills).  For example, a candidate attending a CPE
   course in ethics applicable to the practice of public accounting while
   working as a tax advisory, would support attaining Competency #1 -
   Understanding the Profession's Code of Conduct.

   As a verifying CPA can I require the candidate to complete Section
   2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) prior to signing Section 1?

   Yes.  The Board recommends verifying CPAs discuss the candidate's
   responses to 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) with the candidate.

   I do audits, reviews and compilations; however I do not sign the
   reports.  Does my experience qualify in the skill area "Issuing Reports
   on Financial Statements"?

   Yes.

   The skill areas defined by state law (and included in the Board's
   Experience Affidavit) are: "accounting, issuing reports on financial
   statements, tax, tax advisory, management advisory, financial advisory,
   and consulting skills."  What types of experience does the Board
   consider to be included in these skill areas?

   The skill areas are considered with a broad perspective (rather than a
   limited interpretation).  However, the candidate must identify the
   skill area s/he utilized to attain each specific ability within the
   seven competencies.
     __________________________________________________________________

   License Requirements

   What are the requirements for applying for a license?

   Briefly, you must meet the following requirements:
     * Education: A degree, 150 semester hours, and a concentration in
       accounting;
     * Examination: Pass all parts of the CPA exam;
     * Experience: One year of qualifying experience;
     * Ethics Exam: A score of 90% or better on the "Professional Ethics
       for CPAs" exam;
     * Good character: Lack of a history of dishonest or felonious acts;
       and
     * Submission of a complete form including payment of the fee.

   How long does it normally take for the Board to issue an initial
   license after the candidate has submitted the application and fee?

   Normally, it takes one to three weeks (this depends on the volume of
   incoming mail) to process fully complete applications.  However, if the
   application is incomplete the processing time period will be
   significantly longer because Board staff will need to contact you to
   obtain the missing information or documents.  If additional information
   is needed, Board staff will send you a letter stating what the Board
   has on file and what is still needed to complete the application.

   Applications for licensure may be audited by the Board's Qualifications
   Committee and, as a result, these applications may take up to six weeks
   to process.

   When your fully completed application is approved, Board staff will
   mail an approval letter and a wall license to you and post your name
   and license number on the Licensee Search of the Board's web site.

   Is residency required to become licensed in Washington State?

   No, there are no residency requirements in order to become licensed in
   Washington State.
     __________________________________________________________________

   International Applicants

   Will the Board accept my education from a school(s) which is outside
   the United States?

   Education which was obtained from a school outside the United States
   must be submitted to an approved Foreign Degree Evaluation service for
   evaluation. (see International EducationEvaluation of Credentials.)

   What can I do if I disagree with the evaluation from a Board approved
   evaluator?

   The Board relies on the expertise of the approved evaluation services
   for all evaluations of foreign education. If you disagree with the
   results of an evaluation, you will need to contact the evaluation
   service directly to consider your complaint. The Board will not
   intervene in any disagreements and if a disagreement exists, will rely
   on the final evaluation from the approved evaluation service.

   How can I become a member of the AICPA?

   To apply for membership with the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA),
   contact the AICPA at:

   AICPA

   Transfer of CPA Exam Grades

   Can I transfer my CPA exam grades to Washington if I originally sat for
   the CPA exam in another state for only two sections at a time rather
   than sitting for all unpassed parts?

   If you sat for the CPA exam in another state for the first time in May
   1996 or earlier, your exam grades can be transferred to Washington
   State as long as the grades are valid in the state where you took the
   exam. If you first sat for the exam in November 1996 or later, you must
   meet Washington State conditioning requirements.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Reciprocity

   Can my experience in private industry (or government) which qualified
   me for a license in my original state of licensure be accepted in
   Washington?

   Yes.  See the Board's Policy 2001-2 for complete information on how to
   obtain your experience in private industry, academia, or government.
   Also see RCW 18.04.180.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Continuing Professional Education (CPE)

   Can I use the AICPAs self-study course "Professional Ethics" for CPE?

   No. The course is a requirement for initial licensure. The CPE
   requirement starts with the issue date of your original license and CPE
   completed before that date will not qualify. (The course can be used
   for CPE credit for a reciprocity applicant who received an original
   certificate/license in another state prior to taking the course.)

   Im planning to take a course from a provider who is listed as a NASBA
   Sponsor. Will it be acceptable?

   Yes. NASBA sponsors are acceptable for the recommended CPE hours
   offered.

   My company is installing a new computer system and I will receive
   training on the new system. Will the training qualify for CPE credit?
   How many CPE credits will I earn?

   Yes. Any formal program can qualify. See  WAC 4-25-831 for information
   on determining CPE credit hours.

   My employer is offering/requiring training. Can I use those classes for
   CPE? How do I determine the CPE credit?

   Yes, if it is a formal program deemed to increase your professional
   competency and you have documentation of course information and credit
   earned verified by signature of someone who can verify your
   attendance.  See  WAC 4-25-831.

   Will the Washington Ethics CPE be required for certificate-holders?

   Yes, every three years certificateholders must obtain a four-hour
   course in ethics applicable to the practice of public accounting.  As
   of July 1, 2001 certificate-holders are no longer required to obtain
   120 hours of CPE every three years.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Renewal

   If I let my license lapse, do I have to retake the CPA Exam?

   No. License records for Washington CPAs are permanent. However,
   reinstatement generally requires current CPE and fees. See How To Apply
   for Reinstatement of a License and Reinstatement Form.

   How do I determine when I need to renew my license and certificate?

   If you are a certificateholder check the notification card you received
   from the Board at your last renewal.  This card states the date your
   certificate expires.  You may also check your status using the Board's
   "Licensee Search."  If your certificate expires this year, you need to
   submit a renewal form prior to June 30.

   If you are a licensee, check your license.  The license states the
   expiration date.  You may also check your status using the Board's
   "Licensee Search." If your license expires this year, you need to
   submit a renewal form prior to June 30.

   If you cannot locate the above information, contact the Board office at
   (360) 753-2586.

   I am a licensed CPA and I am changing my employment from public
   accounting to private industry.  If I drop my CPA license, how can I
   get it back?

   Provided you discontinue the use of the CPA title you can submit
   notification to the Board that you have retired.  To return to your
   previous status as a licensee you must submit a complete renewal form,
   confirm that you met the CPE requirements for renewal, and pay the
   appropriate fee.  If you allow your license to lapse (rather than
   notify the Board that you have retired) you must submit a License
   Reinstatement.

   What do I do if I dont have enough CPE for renewal?

   The Board may in limited cases provide an extension to complete the CPE
   requirements.  Extensions may be granted for reasons of individual
   hardship including health, military service, or other reasonable cause.
   You must complete the Waiver Request Form to make your request.

   Firm Licensing

   My name is Jane A. Doe and I am a licensed CPA in Washington state. I
   plan to establish a firm which will provide only accounting and tax
   services to the public. We will not offer or perform attest services. I
   plan to use the firm name "Jane A. Doe & Company." Am I required to
   license my firm with the Board of Accountancy?

   No. Only firms offering or performing attest services to the public, or
   firms using CPA in the firm name, are required to be licensed by the
   Board.

   If I do not license my firm, can I include my name on my business cards
   and on the firm letterhead with the title CPA?

   Yes, provided: (1) you do not include the CPA title as part of the firm
   name, and (2) you do not provide attest services. Attest services
   include compilations, reviews, and audits.

   If I include the following statement after my firm name: "A Certified
   Public Accounting Firm" or "A Professional Service Corporation -
   Certified Public Accountants," do I need to license my firm with the
   Board?

   Yes. The Board considers statements indicating that the firm is a CPA
   firm to be analogous to using "CPA" in the firm name and such firms
   must be licensed with the Board.

   Using the Title

   No.  See Legally Using the CPA Title.

   I allowed my CPA certificate (or license) to lapse. Can I put "Member,
   Washington Society of CPAs" on my resume?

   You may put the words "Member, Washington Society of CPAs" on your
   resume provided the information is factual and is not provided in a
   misleading manner.  For example, you may not put the words "Member,
   Washington Society of CPAs" by your name in the manner of a title.
   Also, you may not use the words "Member, Washington Society of CPAs" on
   your business card.  However, you may place the information within the
   resume as a statement of a fact.

   I allowed my CPA certificate (or license) to lapse.  Can I put "retired
   CPA" on my resume?

   You may put the words "CPA - Retired" on your resume provided the
   information is not provided in a misleading manner.  For example, you
   may not put the words "CPA - Retired" by you name in the manner of a
   title.  Also, you may not use the words "CPA - Retired" on your
   business card.  However, you may place the information within the

   I have passed two parts of the CPA exam and I have 2,000 hours of

   2,000 hours of experience for a CPA license" on my resume and in my
   cover letter?

   Yes.

   I am a Washington State certificateholder.  I do not hold a CPA
   license.  May I prepare and/or sign a tax return using the CPA title?

   No.  Only licensed CPAs or CPAs practicing in Washington under a valid
   grant of practice privileges may use the title CPA when offering to
   perform, or performing, public accounting services.  The practice of

   accounting, auditing and other attest services.  The Board has provided
   guidance on what other services are included in the practice of public
   accounting.  See Practice of Public Accounting.

   Solicitation

   WAC 4-25-660(2) states: "If you use the CPA title to perform or solicit
   services via the Internet, you must include a statement on the Internet
   site that you hold a valid Washington state CPA certificate. This
   statement must be clearly visible and prominently displayed."  What
   triggers the requirement to post the statement?

   If you use the CPA title in connection with offering or providing
   services you must post the statement.

   Does the requirement whereby I must state I am a Washington State CPA
   on my Internet site extend to electronic correspondence? In other
   words, am I required to make the same statement on all my e-mail
   correspondence?

   No. The Boards rule applies to Internet web sites only.

   The Board's rule WAC 4-25-660 requires CPAs to post notice of holding a
   Washington State CPA certificate on their web site.  Will the Board
   accept a blanket statement applicable to all CPAs in the firm?  For
   example, X-Firm has 16 CPA owners/staff.  Rather than list the 16 CPAs
   and state individually that each CPA holds a valid Washington State CPA
   certificate, may X-Firm post a blanket statement on its web site?

   Yes.  X-Firm may post a blanket statement such as:  "All owners and
   staff CPAs of X-Firm hold a valid Washington State CPA certificate and
   license."

   Complaints

   I have a complaint against a Washington CPA, who should I contact?

   Contact the Board at (360) 664-9194 or complaints@cpaboard.wa.gov. See
   Complaint Process.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Compensation

   I am licensed to practice public accounting. May I accept a commission
   on the sale of securities?

   See WAC 4-25-626 and Board Policy--Compensation Arrangements.

   Can I receive stock or other non-cash compensation or services provided
   to non-attest clients?

   Yes.

   Many firms indemnify clients against the adverse impact of the CPA's
   work.  For example, a CPA firm might say that they will complete your
   tax return for a fee, and if there is a problem with the tax return,
   they will pay any interest or penalty.  Is this a contingent fee?

   No, because the fee is not dependent upon the finding or result of such
   service.  Additionally, WAC 4-25-626 states a fee is not regarded as
   contingent:  "if determined based on the results of judicial
   proceedings or the findings of governmental agencies."

   If a CPA prepares a tax return for a client (the CPA's work) and will
   not release the tax return to the client until a past due bill is paid,
   is this in violation of Board rules?

   No, the tax return is the CPA's work product and therefore it is not a
   violation of WAC 4-25-640 or RCW 18.04.390.  However, upon the client's
   request, the CPA must return any client records.
