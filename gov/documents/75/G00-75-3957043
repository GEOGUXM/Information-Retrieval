   The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, the Circuit Rules of the
   Seventh Circuit, the Seventh Circuit Operating Procedures and the
   Criminal Justice Act Plan in this edition of the Practitioner's
   Handbook for Appeals are current to December 1, 2001. Up to date rules
   are always available on the Seventh Circuit Home Page,
   http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov.

   We attempt to keep the Practitioner's Handbook and the attached Rules
   as current and accurate as possible and will periodically publish
   updated editions. We would appreciate being advised of any errors or
   inconsistencies in the handbook or the rules and we welcome suggestions
   for improvement. Any such suggestions should be sent, in writing or by
   telephone, to Andrew J. Kohn, Chief Deputy Clerk, United States Court
   of Appeals for the 7^th Circuit, 219 S, Dearborn Street, Chicago, IL

                                   Preface

   This Practitioner's Handbook was inspired by a similar publication
   entitled "Appeals to the Second Circuit" prepared by the Committee on
   Federal Courts of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York
   (Rev. Ed. 1970), and the "Practitioner's Handbook" for the Sixth
   Circuit, prepared by the Committee on Federal Courts of the Cincinnati
   Chapter of the Federal Bar Association (1971). Both of the above
   committees, and also the Record Press, Inc., 95 Morton Street, New
   York, New York 10014, owner of the copyright on the Second Circuit
   publication, have been good enough to consent to the incorporation of
   substantial portions of their work in the Handbook for the Seventh
   Circuit.

   The Second and Sixth Circuits' handbooks have, however, been
   substantially revised for use in the Seventh Circuit. The
   Practitioner's Handbook was first prepared in 1973. David J. Shipman,
   Robert L. Stern, Owen Rall, and Edward A. Haight of the Seventh Circuit
   Bar Association and Thomas F. Strubbe, Circuit Judge Walter J.
   Cummings, Justice John Paul Stevens, then a Circuit Judge, then Chief
   Judge Luther M. Swygert, and Robert C. Williams, then President of the
   Seventh Circuit Bar Association, provided the leadership to develop the
   Handbook.

   In 1980, then Chief Judge Thomas E. Fairchild promoted a revised
   edition prepared by Circuit Executive Collins T. Fitzpatrick and then
   Clerk Thomas F. Strubbe in consultation with then Circuit Judge Philip
   W. Tone and some of the original authors. Following revisions to the
   Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and the Circuit Rules, then Chief
   Judge William J. Bauer authorized a revised edition in February of
   1992. Following further rule revisions, then Chief Judge Richard A.
   Posner directed the preparation of revised editions in 1994, 1996 and
   1999.

   This 2002 printing has been further revised and updated by Chief Deputy
   Clerk Andrew J. Kohn and Counsel to the Circuit Executive Donald J.
   Wall under the direction of Chief Judge Joel M. Flaum.

                              Introductory Note

   In recent years the number of appeals docketed in the Seventh Circuit
   has greatly increased and the number of filings that take place in each
   appeal have also proliferated. The judges must read the appellant's
   brief, the appellee's brief, the reply brief, if any, and the pertinent
   portions of the appendix or record on appeal in each of the six appeals
   that are orally argued daily. Further, the average appeal has several
   motions on its docket both prior to and subsequent to oral argument.
   Responses are filed to many of these motions.

   All of these documents must be read, consuming a vast amount of
   judicial time. For this reason verbiage is looked upon with great
   disfavor by the Seventh Circuit. Briefs should be kept as short as
   possible. Motions and all other papers filed should be succinct. Every
   failure to honor this request reduces the amount of judge time that
   will be available for work that must be done.

   NOTE: All references to rules are to the Federal Rules of Appellate
   Procedure (Fed. R. App. P.) unless otherwise stated. Local rules of the
   Seventh Circuit will be referred to as Circuit Rules and cited as Cir.
   R. < >. References to these rules are as of December 2001. Counsel are
   encouraged to check the court's web site www.ca7.uscourts.gov for the
   most up to date rules and for any changes or new rules.

   I. Outline of Procedural Steps and Time Limits on Appeals from District
                            Courts and Tax Court

   After an appealable judgment or order has been entered in the district
   court, the following steps are necessary to insure that the appeal will
   be considered on its merits.

   A. Timely Perfection Of Appeal.

   1. Notice of appeal for an appeal as of right is filed, along with the
   $5.00 district court filing fee and the $100.00 appellate docket fee
   (collected on behalf of the court of appeals), with the clerk of the
   district court, or tax court. The fees must be paid upon filing the
   notice of appeal unless the appellant is granted leave to appeal in
   forma pauperis. Fed. R. App. P. 3. Time limits, per Fed. R. App. P. 4,
   are as follows:

   Thirty days from entry of judgment in civil cases.

   Sixty days from entry of judgment in civil cases if the United States
   or an officer or agency of the United States is a party.

   Fourteen days from the date on which the first notice of appeal was
   filed in civil cases for any other party desiring to appeal. Fed R.
   App. P. 4(a)(3).

   Ten days from entry of judgment for appeal by defendants in criminal
   cases.

   Thirty days from entry of judgment for appeal by the United States in
   criminal cases, when authorized by statute.

   The time for appeal runs from the denial of any timely motion under
   Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b), 52(b), 59, or 60(b), if the motion is filed no
   later than 10 days after entry of judgment, and any notice of appeal
   filed prior to disposition of the motion is ineffective until entry of
   the order disposing of the motion. A party wishing to challenge an
   alteration or amendment of the judgment must file a new notice of
   appeal or amend the previously filed notice. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4).

   An extension of up to 30 days may be granted by district court upon
   showing of excusable neglect in civil cases. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5).

   2. Petition for leave to appeal from an interlocutory order. Fed. R.
   App. P. 5.

   Ten days after entry of an interlocutory order with statement
   prescribed by 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b), or of amended order containing such
   statement. Filed with clerk of court of appeals.


   B. Bond For Costs On Appeal.

   1. Civil cases. Fed. R. App. P. 7.

   Costs bonds are no longer automatically required; however, district
   court may require appellant to file bond in form and amount it finds
   necessary to ensure payment of costs.

   2. Interlocutory and certain bankruptcy appeals. Fed. R. App. P. 5(d).

   If required by Fed. R. App. P. 7, within 10 days after entry of order
   granting permission to appeal by court of appeals.

   C. Supersedeas Bond. Fed. R. App. P. 8(b).

   May be presented for approval to the district court at or after the
   time of filing the notice of appeal or of procuring order allowing
   appeal. Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(d).

   D. Transcript Of Proceedings. Fed. R. App. P. 10(b); Cir. R. 10.

   1. Criminal Cases.

   Appointed counsel in a criminal case must request a transcript at the
   time guilt is determined and must renew that request at sentencing if
   the district judge has not yet ordered the transcript prepared.
   Retained counsel must order and pay for the transcript within 10 days
   of filing the notice of appeal. Cir. R. 10(c), (d).

   2. Civil Cases.

   Ten days after filing notice of appeal, appellant must order all
   necessary parts of the transcript from the court reporter. Fed. R. App.
   P. 10(b)(1).

   If the entire transcript is not to be included, appellant must file and
   serve on appellee a description of the parts of the transcript to be
   ordered and a statement of issues within 10 days after filing of notice
   of appeal. Fed. R. App. P. 10(b)(3).

   If appellee deems other parts necessary, he must file a statement of
   parts to be included within 10 days after receipt of appellant's
   statement. Fed. R. App. P. 10(b)(3)(B).

   E. Docketing The Appeal. Fed. R. App. P. 12(a); Cir. R. 12(a).

   The appeal will be docketed as soon as the copy of the notice of appeal
   and the docket entries and appeal information sheet are received by the
   clerk of the court of appeals.

   F. Forwarding The Record To The Court Of Appeals. Fed. R. App. P.11(b);
   Cir. R. 10(a); Cir. R. 11(a).

   Within 14 days of the notice of appeal, the clerk of the district court
   is to prepare the entire record, other than exhibits and procedural
   filings specified in Cir. R. 11(a) (unless an otherwise excludable item
   is ordered by the court of appeals or specially designated by the
   parties). Later filed transcripts are to be subsequently transmitted to
   the court of appeals. Records from the Eastern Division of the Northern
   District of Illinois shall be transmitted to the court of appeals when
   prepared. Records from all other districts in the circuit are
   temporarily retained by the district court clerk's office until
   requested by the clerk of the court of appeals. Counsel wishing to view
   these records may do so in the district court.

   G. Docketing Conferences. Cir. R. 33.

   Occasionally, after the appeal has been docketed in the court of
   appeals, the court may hold a docketing conference to set a schedule
   for filing any unprepared transcripts and briefs, examine jurisdiction,
   simplify and define issues, and consolidate appeals and establish joint
   briefing schedules. Counsel may request a docketing conference. These
   conferences are generally conducted by senior court staff, usually
   Counsel to the Circuit Executive. Note that docketing conferences are
   different from "settlement conferences" which may be held by the
   court's settlement conference attorney pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 33.

   H. Settlement Conference Program. Fed. R. App. P. 33.

   After the appeal has been docketed in the court of appeals, the court
   may direct counsel, and sometimes the litigants, to meet with one of
   the court's settlement conference attorneys to discuss the possibility
   of resolving the appeal by agreement. See Section XVII(E) of this
   Handbook.

   I. Counsel of Record. Cir. R. 3(d).

   An attorney for a party or who first files a document with the clerk of
   this court will be entered on the docket as counsel of record, and the
   court will send papers only to counsel of record for each party.
   Counsel of record may not withdraw without consent of the court unless
   another attorney simultaneously substitutes as counsel of record.

   J. Representation and Disclosure Statements. Fed. R. App. P. 12(b),
   Fed. R. App. P 26.1 and Cir. R. 26.1

   The attorney who filed the notice of appeal must file a statement as to
   all parties that the attorney represents within 10 days of filing the
   notice. Fed. R. App. P. 12(b). Every attorney for a non-governmental
   party or amicus curiae must file a disclosure statement containing the
   information required by Cir. R. 26.1and, if a corporate party, identify
   all its parent corporations and list any publicly held company that
   owns 10% or more of the party's stock as required by Fed. R. App. P.
   26.1. Attorneys must provide answers to all questions required by the
   rules. Lawyers should file their disclosure statements as soon as
   possible, but, these statements must be filed with the parties first
   motion, response or other request for relief and also included
   separately in the party's brief.

   K. Briefing Schedule. Fed. R. App. P. 31(a); Cir. R. 31(a).

   Unless a different schedule is set by order of the court, appellant's
   brief is due 40 days after docketing of appeal (regardless of
   completeness of the record); appellee's brief 30 days after appellant's
   brief is filed; and reply brief 14 days after appellee's brief.

   L. Statement Concerning Oral Argument. Fed. R. App. P. 34(a).

   A party may include, as part of a principal brief, a short statement
   explaining why oral argument is (or is not) appropriate under the
   criteria of Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).

   M. Oral Argument. Cir. R. 34(a).

   Time allowed for oral argument is determined by the court. Counsel must
   notify clerk at least two days in advance of argument date of the
   person presenting oral argument.

   N. Petition For Rehearing. Fed. R. App. P. 40; Cir. R. 40.

   Fourteen days after entry of judgment unless time is shortened or
   extended by order. Forty five days after entry of judgment in civil
   cases in which the United States, an officer or agency thereof, is a
   party. There is not a "mailbox rule" for petitions for rehearing. All
   petitions must be received by the clerk by the due date.

   O. Mandate. Fed. R. App. P. 41; Cir. R. 41.

   Issued by the clerk automatically 21 days after entry of judgment or
   seven days after the denial of a petition for rehearing unless time is
   shortened or extended by order. Issued immediately after voluntary
   dismissal or certain procedural dismissals.

   P. Petition For Writ Of Certiorari.

   Ninety days from entry of judgment in all cases unless Supreme Court
   allows additional time not exceeding 60 days. 28 U.S.C. ยง 2101(c); Sup.
   Ct. R. 13.1 and 13.2.


                        II. Organization of the Court

   The Seventh Circuit encompasses the states of Illinois, Indiana, and
   Wisconsin. The court of appeals sits in Chicago, Illinois. The court at
   present is authorized eleven active judgeships. Senior circuit judges
   participate in the work of the court. The office of the clerk is
   located in Room 2722 of the United States Courthouse, 219 South
   Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60604. The Main Courtroom is
   located in Room 2721. Sometimes arguments will be scheduled in the
   Ceremonial Courtroom, Room 2525. All of the judges have chambers in the
   same building. The clerk's office is open for filing and other services
   from 9:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. every weekday except for federal holidays.
   Fed. R. App. P. 45. In an emergency, filings during non-business hours
   can be made by making prior arrangements with the clerk's office. The
   court also applies a "transom rule" whereby documents presented for
   filing at 9:00 A.M. when the doors open are filed as of the previous
   business day. In addition to their record-keeping duties, the clerk's
   staff provides procedural assistance to counsel or parties.

   By statute the administrative head of the court is the chief judge. A
   judge attains that position by seniority of service on the court. When
   he reaches the age of 70, he may continue as an active member of the
   court, but not as chief judge. 28 U.S.C. ยง 45(a).

   The chief judge presides over any panel on which he sits. If the chief
   judge does not sit, the most senior Seventh Circuit active judge on the
   panel normally presides. The presiding judge assigns the writing of
   opinions at the conference immediately following the day's oral
   arguments.

   To facilitate the disposition of cases, statutory provision is made for
   the assignment of additional judges. The chief judge may request the
   Chief Justice of the United States to appoint a "visiting" judge from
   another circuit, 28 U.S.C. ยง 291(a), or, more frequently, he may
   himself designate senior judges, 28 U.S.C. ยง 294(c), or district court
   judges from the districts within the circuit, 28 U.S.C. ยง 292(a), to
   serve on panels of the Seventh Circuit.

   Upon reaching retirement age, a judge can elect to become a senior
   judge. 28 U.S.C. ยง 371(b). If he or she continues to perform
   substantial duties, as most do, he or she may retain chambers and is
   entitled to secretarial and law clerk services.

   In addition to a full caseload of hearings and opinion writing, the
   chief judge is responsible for the administration of the court of
   appeals and the district courts and bankruptcy courts in the seven
   districts of the circuit. He is a member of the Judicial Conference of
   the United States, 28 U.S.C. ยง 331, and is head of the Judicial Council
   for the circuit. The council consists of the active circuit judges on
   the court and ten district court judges and is empowered to "make all
   necessary orders for the effective and expeditious administration of
   the business of the courts within its circuit." 28 U.S.C. ยง 332(d). The
   judicial council has overall responsibility for the operation of the
   court of appeals, the district courts, and the bankruptcy courts within
   the Seventh Circuit. The circuit executive works for the council and
   also is the administrator of the court of appeals. The circuit
   executive is assisted in his administrative tasks by the clerk, circuit
   librarian, senior settlement conference attorney, and senior staff
   attorney.


                 III. Panel Composition and Case Assignment

   The court, unless an en banc hearing has been ordered (Fed. R. App. P.
   35), sits in panels of three judges. 28 U.S.C. ยง 46(c). In the Seventh
   Circuit the court regularly hears cases from early in September until
   the middle of June. This 10 month period comprises the September Term
   of the court. It is divided into the September, January and April
   Sessions. On rare occasions emergency matters and death penalty appeals
   are heard while the court is in recess and the court now sits a few
   days during the summer. The court ordinarily convenes at 9:30 A.M., and
   after entertaining any motions for admission of attorneys to practice
   before the court, hears oral argument in the cases scheduled for the
   day, usually six cases in the morning.

   Assignments of judges to panels are made at least a month before the
   oral argument on a random basis. In death penalty appeals, panels are
   randomly assigned when the appeal is docketed. Cir. R. 22(a)(2). Each
   judge is assigned to sit approximately the same number of times per
   term with each of his or her colleagues. The clerk distributes the
   briefs and appendices to the judges substantially before the scheduled
   date of oral argument. The judges read the briefs prior to oral
   argument.

   The calendar of cases to be orally argued in a given week is prepared
   and circulated to the judges, and the judges advise the chief judge of
   any disqualifications. The disclosure statements filed pursuant to
   Circuit Rule 26.1 and Fed. R. App. P. 26.1 are intended to make this
   process more accurate and, therefore, more helpful. The judges are then
   randomly assigned to sit in various panels. This separation of the
   processes of randomly assigning panels and scheduling cases avoids even
   the remote possibility of the deliberate assignment of an appeal to a
   particular panel. The identity of the three judges on any panel is not
   made public until the day the cases are argued. An exception to this
   procedure occurs when a previously argued case is on the docket for a
   subsequent hearing. In this situation the original panel may be
   reconstituted to hear the second appeal.

   Each judge reads the briefs and relevant portions of the appendix or
   record prior to oral argument. At the time a case is being argued, no
   member of the panel knows which judge will have the responsibility of
   writing the opinion or order deciding the case.

   The large and ever-growing number of appeals to be decided requires
   each judge to carry a heavy workload into the summer recess. Each judge
   devotes most of his or her summer to writing decisions. It is the goal
   of each judge to complete opinions and orders assigned to him or her
   during the previous year before the convening of the September Term.

   Motions and emergency matters are received and reviewed by staff
   attorneys designated as motions attorneys and are presented to the
   judge assigned as the "motions judge." Certain types of motions
   requiring action by three judges are assigned to panels which usually
   act without oral argument. This responsibility is rotated among the
   active judges on a weekly basis.

                 IV. Admission to Practice Before the Court

   The lead attorneys for all parties represented by counsel, as well as
   counsel presenting oral argument, must be admitted to practice in this
   court no more than 30 days after the docketing of the matters in which
   they are involved. Cir. R. 46(a). To qualify for admission to practice,
   an attorney must be a member of the bar in good standing of either the
   highest court of a state or of any court in the federal system. Fed. R.
   App. P. 46(a). There is no length of admission requirement. Attorneys
   representing any federal, state or local governmental unit are
   permitted to argue pro hac vice without being formally admitted. Cir.
   R. 46(c). The admission fee for the Seventh Circuit is currently
   $15.00. Attorneys representing the federal government or any agency
   thereof and court-appointed attorneys representing indigent parties do
   not have to pay the admission fee. Cir. R. 46(b).

   Upon oral motion of an already-admitted attorney, new applicants may be
   admitted to practice immediately prior to the commencement of oral
   arguments, usually at 9:30 A.M. on any morning when the court is in
   session. In lieu of appearing personally, the applicant may send a
   written application and sponsor's affidavit on a form provided by the
   clerk upon request. Such in absentia applications are generally acted
   on about once a week by the designated motions judge.

   If the applicant desires to be admitted to practice in open court, both
   the applicant and the sponsor must appear personally. The short
   application form should be filed in the clerk's office prior to 9:30
   A.M. As the first order of business, the presiding judge will call all
   motions for admission. The sponsor should briefly outline the
   applicant's background, and must vouch for the applicant's personal
   integrity and professional ethics. The applicant then takes the
   prescribed oath as administered by the clerk in the courtroom. Later he
   must sign the "Roll of Attorneys" in the clerk's office. Funds derived
   from the admission fees are deposited in the Lawyers' Fund which is
   used for court purposes described in Circuit Rule 46(b). Attorneys
   admitted to the Seventh Circuit are entitled to use the William J.
   Campbell Library of the United States Courts.


                          V. Appellate Jurisdiction

   A. In General

   The Seventh Circuit is ever mindful of the limits on its adjudicatory
   power and vigilant of jurisdictional faults throughout the appellate
   process. The Wellness Community-National v. Wellness House, 70 F.3d 46,
   50-51 (7th Cir. 1995); see also Yang v. I.N.S., 109 F.3d 1185, 1192
   (7th Cir. 1997) (a court always has jurisdiction to determine whether
   it has jurisdiction). Litigants can expect the court on its own to
   review both its own jurisdiction and that of the district court at any
   point in the appellate proceedings, Baer v. First Options of Chicago,
   Inc., 72 F.3d 1294, 1298 (7th Cir. 1995); Kelly v. United States, 29
   F.3d 1107, 1113 (7th Cir. 1994), although a deficiency in appellate
   jurisdiction takes precedence and prevents a determination of the
   extent of the district court's jurisdiction. Massey Ferguson Division
   of Varity Corp. v. Gurley, 51 F.3d 102, 104 (7th Cir. 1995).

   Similarly, every litigant has an obligation to bring both appellate and
   district court jurisdictional problems to the court's attention. See
   Espinueva v. Garrett, 895 F.2d 1164, 1166 (7th Cir. 1990); Cir. R.
   3(c), 28(a) and (b). The parties may not consent to appellate
   jurisdiction. United States v. Smith, 992 F.2d 98, 99 (7th Cir. 1993);
   see also United States v. Tittjung, 235 F.3d 330, 335 (7th Cir. 2000).
   Attempts to engineer a final judgment by voluntarily dismissing viable
   claims without prejudice (so that the claims may be revived on
   conclusion of an appeal) likewise are insufficient to vest the court
   with jurisdiction. See West v. Macht, 197 F.3d 1185 (7th Cir. 1999);
   Union Oil Co. v. John Bown, E & C, Inc., 121 F.3d 305 (7th Cir. 1997);
   see also ITOFCA, Inc. v. MegaTrans Logistics, Inc., 235 F.3d 360 (7th
   Cir. 2000) (no jurisdiction where form of dismissal of claim without
   prejudice permitted claim's refiling at any time). Cf. Furnance v. Bd.
   of Trustees of Southern Illinois Univ., 218 F.3d 666, 669-70 (7th Cir.
   2000) (dismissal of complaint without prejudice may constitute adequate
   finality for appeal if amendment cannot save action); South Austin
   Coalition Community Council v. SBC Communications, Inc., 191 F.3d 842,
   844 (7th Cir. 1999) (dismissal of suit without prejudice to permit
   litigation of merits on some other court or at some other time is a
   final appealable decision). However, a party may eliminate the bar to
   appellate jurisdiction in such circumstances if the party agrees to
   treat the dismissal of its claims as having been with prejudice. JTC
   Petroleum Co. v. Piasa Motor Fuels, Inc, 190 F.3d 775, 776-77 (7th Cir.
   1999); see also ITOFCA, Inc. v. MegaTrans Logistics, Inc., 235 F.3d at
   365.

   Parties should keep in mind that Cir. R. 50 calls for the district
   judge to state reasons when the court enters dispositive orders and any
   orders that may be appealed. The rule urges the parties to flag the
   absence of reasons as quickly as possible so that the court may remand
   the case promptly to make repairs, rather than go through full briefing
   and argument in the dark. See United States v. Mobley, 193 F.3d 492,
   494-95 (7th Cir. 1999).

   The court may not as a rule choose to pass on jurisdictional issues and
   decide the case on the merits. Steel Co. v. Citizens For A Better
   Environment, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 1012-16 (1998).

   (I) District Courts.

   The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
   extends to all criminal appeals and virtually all civil appeals from
   the seven district courts within the circuit. They are: the Northern,
   Southern and Central Districts of Illinois; the Northern and Southern
   Districts of Indiana; and the Eastern and Western Districts of
   Wisconsin.

   (II) Magistrate Judge Decisions.

   The Seventh Circuit's jurisdiction over appeals from district court
   decisions includes appeals from a magistrate judge's final decision in
   civil cases pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(c)(3). Fed. R. App. P. 3(a)(3).
   Unanimous consent of all parties is required. Mark I, Inc. v. Gruber,
   38 F.3d 369, 370 (7th Cir. 1994). Cf. Brook, Weiner, Sered, Kreger &
   Weinberg v. Coreq, Inc., 53 F.3d 851 (7th Cir. 1995) (consents of
   original parties are binding on parties that were substituted as legal
   representatives of deceased party or as legal successor of original
   party). Parties added to a case after the original parties have
   consented must also agree to submission of the case to the magistrate
   judge; if they do not, the case must be returned to a district judge.
   Williams v. General Electric Capital Auto Lease, Inc., 159 F.3d 266,
   268-69 (7th Cir.1998). The required consents can be provided after
   judgment is entered, King v. Ionization Intern., Inc., 825 F.2d 1180,
   1195 (7th Cir. 1987) (the statute does not require a specific form or
   time of consent), or even after oral argument on appeal. See Drake v.
   Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co., 134 F.3d 878, 883 (7th Cir.
   1998).

   (III) Tax Court; Administrative Agency Decisions.

   In addition, the court has jurisdiction to review decisions of the
   United States Tax Court (see 26 U.S.C. ยง 7482(a), (b)) and of various
   federal administrative tribunals. The court's jurisdiction in such
   cases depends, however, on the provisions of the various statutes
   relating to judicial review of agency determinations; the relevant
   statutory authority should be examined in each instance. See, e.g.,
   CH2M Hill Central, Inc. v. Herman, 131 F3d 1244 (7th Cir. 1997).

   (IV) Federal Circuit; Supreme Court; State Court Decisions.

   Appeals in Tucker Act cases involving less than $10,000 and appeals in
   patent cases, among others, go to the Court of Appeals for the Federal
   Circuit. See generally 28 U.S.C. ยง 1295. Also, there are a few classes
   of cases appealable directly from the district court to the Supreme
   Court of the United States. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1253, 2284
   (decisions of three-judge panels). The court does not under any
   circumstances have jurisdiction to hear appeals from decisions of state
   courts. See Reilly v. Waukesha County, 993 F.2d 1284, 1287 (7th Cir.
   1993).

   (V) Screening Procedure.

   Every federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy
   itself of its own jurisdiction. Steel Co. v. Citizens For A Better
   Environment, 118 S.Ct. at 1012-13. In an effort to uncover
   jurisdictional defects very early in the appellate process, the Seventh
   Circuit reviews each new appeal shortly after it is docketed to
   determine whether potential appellate jurisdictional problems exist.
   Generally, only the "short record" is reviewed: the notice of appeal,
   the Cir. R. 3(c) docketing statement (if attached), the judgment(s) or
   order(s) appealed, and the district court docket sheet.

   If an initial review indicates that there may be a problem, the court
   (through a motions panel) attempts to resolve the problem, if possible,
   before the appeal is allowed to proceed. See generally Barrow v. Falck,
   977 F.2d 1100, 1102-03 (7th Cir. 1992). Of course, a merits panel is
   free to re-examine jurisdictional issues that a motions panel decided,
   uninhibited by the law of the case doctrine or by Circuit Rule 40(e).
   United States v. Lilly, 206 F.3d 756, 760 (7th Cir. 2000); Bogard v.
   Wright, 159 F.3d 1060, 1062 (7th Cir. 1998); American Fed'n of Grain
   Millers, Local 24 v. Cargill, Inc., 15 F.3d 726, 727 (7th Cir. 1994).
   Cf Butera v. Apfel, 173 F.3d 1049, 1053 (7th Cir. 1999) (merits panel
   not obligated to revisit jurisdictional issue resolved by a motions
   panel at an earlier date).

   In some cases, the district court may take corrective action under
   Fed.R.App.P. 10(e) or Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(a), to clarify a jurisdictional
   issue that the court discovers in the screening process. Rice v.
   Sunrise Express, Inc., 209 F.3d 1008, 1014 fn. 9 (7th Cir. 2000) ; see
   also Boyko v Anderson, 185 F.3d 672, 674 (7th Cir. 1999) (limited
   remands appropriate to perfect appellate jurisdiction to enable appeal
   to go forward.) A proper nunc pro tunc order that memorializes past
   action may eliminate jurisdictional concerns. Id. at 1014-15.

   B. Standing To Appeal

   Article III of the Constitution requires that federal courts only
   decide disputes that present "actual, ongoing cases or controversies."
   Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 110 S. Ct. 1249, 1253 (1990). This
   constitutional requirement must persist throughout all stages of the
   appellate proceedings. Id. And like any other question implicating
   Article III jurisdiction, the court of appeals is obligated to consider
   the issue of standing, whether or not the parties have raised it. Brown
   v. Disciplinary Committee of the Edgerton Volunteer Fire Dept., 97 F.3d
   969, 972 (7th Cir. 1996).

   An appeal that no longer presents a live controversy is moot and will
   be dismissed. Henco, Inc. v. Brown, 904 F.2d 11, 13 (7th Cir. 1990).
   See also Selcke v. New England Ins. Co., 2 F.3d 790, 792 (7th Cir.
   1993) (burden of proof on party asserting appellate jurisdiction if
   challenged). "The...test for mootness on appeal is...whether it is
   still possible to 'fashion some form of meaningful relief' to the
   appellant in the event he prevails on the merits." Flynn v. Sandahl, 58
   F.3d 283, 287 (7th Cir. 1995), quoting Church of Scientology v. United
   States, 113 S.Ct. 447, 450 (1992) (emphasis in original). See also In
   re Turner, 156 F.3d 713, 716 (7th Cir.1998). As a final item in cases
   that are moot, the court of appeals typically will need to address the
   issue of vacatur -- whether to vacate a district court order when it
   becomes moot on appeal. Orion Sales, Inc. v. Emerson Radio Corp., 148
   F.3d 840, 843 (7th Cir. 1998).

   The person who brings an appeal must have standing to do so. Moy v.
   Cowen, 958 F.2d 168, 170 (7th Cir. 1992). It is a well-settled rule
   that "only parties to a lawsuit, or those that properly become parties,
   may appeal an adverse judgment." Marino v.Ortiz, 484 U.S. 301,304
   (1988). In most cases, this means parties of record at the time the
   judgment was entered, including those who have become parties by
   intervention, substitution or third-party practice. In re VMS Ltd.
   Partnership Sec. Litig., 976 F.2d 362, 366 (7th Cir. 1992). See also
   Felzen v. Andreas, 134 F.3d 873 (7th Cir. 1998); but see Wiggins v.
   Martin, 150 F.3d 671, 673 (7th Cir. 1998) (intervenor in trial court
   may nevertheless lack standing on appeal).

   Judgments, not statements in opinions, are the basis for appellate
   review. An appeal does not present a real case or controversy where the
   appellant complains not about a judgment but about statements or
   findings in the court's opinion. Chathas v. Local 134 IBEW, 233 F.3d
   508, 512 (7th Cir. 2000); Warner/Elektra/Atlantic Corp. v. County of
   DuPage, 991 F.2d 1280, 1282-83 (7th Cir. 1993); Pollution Control
   Industries of America, Inc. v. Van Gundy, 979 F.2d 1271, 1273 (7th Cir.
   1992); Abbs v. Sullivan, 963 F.2d 918, 924-25 (7th Cir. 1992).

   A party who has received all the relief sought in the trial court is
   not aggrieved and cannot bring an appeal. Abbs v. Sullivan, 963 F.2d
   918, 924 (7th Cir. 1992). Cf. INB Banking Co. v. Iron Peddlers, Inc.,
   993 F.2d 1291, 1292 (7th Cir. 1993) (a party who consents to judgment
   while explicitly reserving the right to appeal preserves that right);
   Council 31, Am. Fed. of State, County & Mun. Employees v. Ward, 978
   F.2d 373, 380 (7th Cir. 1992) (conditional cross-appeals and
   unconditional appeals treated differently). Put another way, "[o]nly a
   person injured by the terms of the judgment is entitled to appeal."
   Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Co. V. Reinke, 43 F.3d 1152, 1154 (7th Cir.
   1995). See also Nationwide Insurance v. Board of Trustees of the
   University of Illinois, 116 F.3d 1154, 1155 (7th Cir. 1997) (victim of
   insured's alleged wrongdoing -- a defendant in insurer's declaratory
   judgment action -- suffered no cognizable injury from ruling that
   insurer had no duty to defend (the only ruling appealed);
   defendant-victim's appeal dismissed). Similarly, a party cannot appeal
   a judgment in its favor merely because it wants some other unsuccessful
   party to prevail against someone else on some aspect of the case.
   Mueller v. Reich, 54 F.3d 438, 441 (7th Cir. 1995), vacated on
   unrelated grounds under the name Wisconsin v. Mueller, 117 S.Ct. 1077
   (1997).

   A winning party cannot appeal (or cross-appeal) because the district
   court rejected one (or more) of its arguments on the way to deciding in
   its favor. A prevailing party is entitled to advance in support of its
   judgment all arguments if presented to the district court. An appeal
   (or cross-appeal) is necessary and proper only when a party wants the
   appellate court to alter the judgment (the bottom line, not the grounds
   or reasoning) of the district court. See Jones Motor Co., Inc. v.
   Holtkamp, Liese, Beckemeier & Childress, P.C., 197 F.3d 1190, 1191 (7th
   Cir. 1999); Stone Container Corp. v. Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &
   Ins. Co., 165 F.3d 1157, 1159 (7th Cir. 1999); Rose Acre Farms, Inc. v.
   Madigan, 956 F.2d 670, 672 (7th Cir., 1992).

   As a final matter, be mindful that the court has jurisdiction to
   determine whether the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue or the district
   court otherwise lacked jurisdiction to act. See, e.g., United States v.
   One 1987 Mercedes Benz Roadster 560 SEC, 2 F.3d 241, 242 n.1 (7th Cir.
   1993); Tisza v. Communications Workers of America, 953 F.2d 298, 300
   (7th Cir. 1992).

   C. Appealability

   (I) Criminal Cases.

   Ordinarily, a defendant in a criminal case may not take an appeal until
   a sentence has been entered. Flanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259,
   263 (1984); Pollard v. United States, 352 U.S. 354, 358 (1957); United
   States v. Kaufmann, 951 F.2d 793 (7th Cir. 1992); Fed. R. Crim. P.
   32(b)(1). A pretrial detention order, however, is appealable, 18 U.S.C.
   ยง 3145(c), but because these cases must be decided quickly, 18 U.S.C. ยง
   3145(c), the appellant should file an appropriate motion within the
   appeal rather than having the case proceed to full briefing. United
   States v. Daniels, 772 F.2d 382, 383-84 (7th Cir. 1985); United States
   v. Bilanzich, 771 F.2d 292, 300 (7th Cir. 1985); Cir. R. 9(a). The
   government is statutorily authorized to appeal certain interlocutory
   orders, see 18 U.S.C. ยง 3731, and is permitted to appeal some
   sentences. See 18 U.S.C. ยง 3742(b). See also United States v. Byerley,
   46 F.3d 694, 698 (7th Cir. 1995) (the United States has no right of
   appeal in a criminal case absent explicit statutory authority).

   In addition, a limited exception to the final judgment rule has been
   recognized in criminal cases for interlocutory orders within the scope
   of the collateral order doctrine. United States v. J.J.K., 76 F.3d 870
   (7th Cir. 1996) (collateral order doctrine is to be interpreted
   particularly narrowly in criminal cases). See Abney v. United States,
   431 U.S. 651 (1977) (pretrial order denying motion to dismiss an
   indictment on double jeopardy grounds immediately appealable under
   collateral order doctrine); but see United States v. Ganos, 961 F.2d
   1284 (7th Cir. 1992) (a double jeopardy claim that is frivolous or not
   colorable defeats jurisdiction). See also United States v. Davis, 1
   F.3d 606, 607-08 (7th Cir. 1993) (order denying motion in limine to bar
   disclosure of information based on attorney-client privilege); United
   States v. Corbitt, 879 F.2d 224, 227 n.1 (7th Cir. 1989) (order
   releasing presentence report to media); United States v. Dorfman, 690
   F.2d 1230, 1231-32 (7th Cir. 1982) (pretrial order authorizing
   publication of wiretap transcripts). Orders denying or granting a
   motion to disqualify counsel are not within this exception. See
   Flanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259 (1984); United States v. White,
   743 F.2d 488 (7th Cir. 1984); In re Schmidt, 775 F.2d 822 (7th Cir.
   1985) (order disqualifying counsel for grand jury witness); but see In
   Re Grand Jury Subpoena of Rochon, 873 F.2d 170, 173 (7th Cir. 1989)
   (order disqualifying government counsel).

   (II) Civil Cases.

   (1) Final Judgment Rule. Generally an appeal may not be taken in a
   civil case until a final judgment disposing of all claims against all
   parties has been entered on the district court's civil docket pursuant
   to Fed. R. Civ. P. 58. See Alonzi v. Budget Construction Co., 55 F.3d
   331, 333 (7th Cir. 1995); Cleaver v. Elias, 852 F.2d 266 (7th Cir.
   1988). The parties, however, can waive the separate document
   requirement of Rule 58 if the only obstacle to appellate review is the
   district court's failure to enter judgment on a separate document,
   Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, 435 U.S. 381, 386 (1978), and if the
   district court makes clear that the case is over. Smith-Bey v. Hospital
   Administrator, 841 F.2d 751, 755-56 (7th Cir. 1988); Foremost Sales
   Promotions, Inc. v. Director, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms,
   812 F.2d 1044, 1046 (7th Cir. 1987). Cf. West Lafayette Cor. v. Taft
   Contracting Co., Inc., 178 F.3d 840, 842-43 (7th Cir. 1999) (agreement
   to release claim good reason to enter judgment but not a substitute for
   action by the district court); Spitz v. Tepfer, 171 F.3d 443, 447-48
   (7th Cir. 1999) (district court's technical error in failing to address
   an issue, if issue abandoned and court plainly intended to rule on all
   issues in case, no impediment to appellate jurisdiction). It remains
   essential, however, to know who won what. Buck v. U.S. Digital
   Communications, Inc., 141 F.3d 710, 711 (7th Cir. 1998). Cf. Health
   Cost Controls of Illinois v. Washington, 187 F.3d 703, 707-08 (7th Cir.
   1999) (failure of district court to specify amount of damages not bar
   to jurisdiction if parties agree to amount of damages during course of
   appeal.)

   An appeal will not be dismissed if the judgment fails to resolve purely
   ministerial matters, involving no discretion. See Richardson v.
   Gramley, 998 F.2d 463, 465 (7th Cir. 1993). Cf. Buchanan v. United
   States, 82 F.3d 706 (7th Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (judgment in a suit
   for monetary relief not appealable if it fails to specify either the
   amount due plaintiff or a formula by which that amount of money could
   be computed in mechanical fashion). Still, the parties should insure
   that the district court has issued a separate judgment. See Armstrong
   v. Ahitow, 36 F.3d 574 (7th Cir. 1994); Chambers v. American Trans Air,
   Inc., 990 F.2d 317, 318 (7th Cir. 1993); Tobey v. Extel/JWP, Inc., 985
   F.2d 330, 331 (7th Cir. 1993). Indeed, the court on a number of
   occasions has stressed the importance of a clear, definite and specific
   judgment and reminded counsel of their duty to take steps to see to the
   entry of a proper judgment. Continental Casualty Co. v. Anderson
   Excavating & Wrecking Co., 189 F.3d 512, 515-16 (7th Cir. 1999); Health
   Cost Controls of Illinois v. Washington, 187 F.3d 703, 708 (7th Cir.
   1999).

   No special wording is required to comply with Rule 58. The judgment
   merely must be self-contained and set forth the relief to which the
   parties are entitled in resolving all claims of all parties. Massey
   Ferguson Division of Varity Corp. v. Gurley, 51 F.3d 102, 104-05 (7th
   Cir. 1995); Paganis v. Blonstein, 3 F.3d 1067, 1071-72 (7th Cir. 1993).
   In fact, a completed minute order form commonly used in the district
   court for Northern District of Illinois may constitute a Rule 58
   judgement although it is preferred that the clerks of the district
   court use Form AO 450 to comply with Rule 58. Hope v. United States, 43
   F.3d 1140, 1142 (7th Cir. 1994). A judgment that simply announces the
   prevailing party without "award[ing] the relief to which the prevailing
   party is entitled," see, e.g., American Inter-Fidelity Exchange v.
   American Re-Insurance Co., 17 F.3d 1018, 1020 (7th Cir. 1994), or
   merely repeats that a motion was granted, see, e.g., Camp v. Gregory,
   67 F.3d 1286, 1290 (7th Cir. 1995); Massey Ferguson Division of Varity
   Corp. v. Gurley, 51 F.3d at 104, is defective. Unless some other
   document clearly reveals the terms on which the litigation has been
   resolved or the parties otherwise agree on the terms of the resolution
   of the case to remove any ambiguity in the district court's judgment,
   it is not appealable. See, e.g., Health Cost Controls of Illinois v.
   Washington, 187 F.3d 703, 708 (7th Cir. 1999); Buck v. U.S. Digital
   Communications, 141 F.3d 710 (7th Cir. 1998); Buchanan v. United
   States, 82 F.3d 706 (7th Cir. 1996) (per curiam); Burgess v. Ryan, 996
   F.2d 180 (7th Cir. 1993). Litigants and their attorneys should bring
   such matters promptly to the district judge's attention so that the
   district judge can take appropriate action to correct any deficiencies
   in the judgment. Failure to act will cause unnecessary additional work
   for the court on appeal in untangling jurisdictional snarls.

   Although it is possible to appeal in advance of a proper Rule 58
   judgment, it is never necessary to do so. United States v. Indrelunas,
   411 U.S. 216 (1973). Indeed, "[a] party safely may defer the appeal
   until Judgment Day if that is how long it takes to enter the document."
   In re Kilgus, 811 F.2d 1112, 1117 (7th Cir. 1987); see also Champ v.
   Siegel Trading Company, Inc., 55 F.3d 269, 273-74 (7th Cir. 1995);
   Brill v. McDonald's Corp., 28 F.3d 633 (7th Cir. 1994); Eckstein v.
   Balcor Film Investors, 8 F.3d 1121 (7th Cir. 1993). As such, it is
   incorrect to assume that the maximum number of opportunities to appeal
   is one. Otis v. City of Chicago, 29 F.3d 1159, 1166-67 (7th Cir. 1994)
   (en banc).

   It is worth pointing out that the court mechanically applies the final
   judgment rule embodied in Rule 58 to protect the opportunity to appeal,
   and will dismiss an appeal as premature rather than untimely even
   though it is clear that the district court intended its order to end
   the case. Armstrong v. Ahitow, 36 F.3d 574 (7th Cir. 1994) (per
   curiam).

   After a final judgment has been entered, a party has a right to appeal
   any earlier interlocutory order entered during the proceedings in the
   district court (provided that it has not been mooted by subsequent
   proceedings) as well as the final decision itself. See Glass v. Dachel,
   2 F.3d 733, 738 (7th Cir. 1993) (reference in the notice of appeal to
   the final order presents the whole case to us on appeal); see also
   Hendrich v. Pegram, 154 F.3d 362, 368 (7th Cir. 1998); Matter of
   Grabill Corp., 983 F.2d 773, 775 (7th Cir. 1993); House v. Belford, 956
   F.2d 711, 716 (7th Cir. 1992). Cf. Ackerman v. Northwestern Mutual Life
   Ins. Co., 172 F.3d 467, 468-69 (7th Cir. 1999) (notice of appeal cannot
   bring up for review an order entered after the notice's filing).

   Post-judgment proceedings are treated for purposes of appeal as a
   separate lawsuit, and orders in those proceedings are appealable if
   final. Trustees of Funds of IBEW Local 701 v. Pyramid Electric, 223
   F.3d 459, 463-64 (7th Cir. 2000).

   (2) Attorneys' Fees. Where a district court has entered a final
   judgment on the merits of a case, the entry of a subsequent order
   granting or denying an award of attorneys' fees for the case at hand is
   a separate proceeding having no effect on the finality of the merits
   judgment, and a separate notice of appeal is required, Budinich v.
   Becton Dickinson & Co., 486 U.S. 196 (1988); Dunn v. Truck World, Inc.,
   929 F.2d 311 (7th Cir. 1991), unless the district court, acting under
   Fed. R. Civ. P. 58, enters an order extending the time to appeal. See
   Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)4. An order determining that a party is entitled to
   fees but leaving the amount of the award undetermined may be appealable
   if it can be consolidated with an appeal on the merits. Kokomo Tube Co.
   v. Dayton Equipment Services Co., 123 F.3d 616, 621-22 (7th Cir. 1997);
   BASF Corp.v. Old World Trading Co., Inc., 41 F.3d 1081, 1099 (7th Cir.
   1994); Vandenplas v. Muskego, 797 F.2d 425, 428 n.1 (7th Cir. 1986);
   Bittner v. Sadoff & Rudoy Industries, 728 F.2d 820, 826-27 (7th Cir.
   1984). Otherwise, it will be dismissed as premature. See Hershinow v.
   Bonamarte, 735 F.2d 264, 266-67 (7th Cir. 1984). Interim awards may be
   appealed under the collateral order doctrine when the payor may have
   difficulty getting the money back. People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of
   Educ. Dist. No. 205, 921 F.2d 132 (7th Cir. 1991); Palmer v. City of
   Chicago, 806 F.2d 1316, 1318-20 (7th Cir. 1986).

   An award of attorney fees, like the merits decision, must be set forth
   in a separate document as provided in Rule 58 although the appellant
   may waive entry of a separate judgment if the district intended the fee
   order to be final. Miller v. Artistic Cleaners, 153 F.3d 781, 783-84
   (7th Cir. 1998). A notice of appeal from an order awarding or denying
   fees does not bring up the judgment on the merits for appellate review.
   Exchange Nat'l Bank v. Daniels, 763 F.2d 286, 289-94 (7th Cir. 1985).

   (3) Bankruptcy. Bankruptcy cases present unique issues concerning
   finality. A considerably more flexible approach to finality applies in
   a bankruptcy appeal taken under 28 U.S.C. ยง 158(d) than in an ordinary
   civil appeal under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291. In re Gould, 977 F.2d 1038,
   1040-41 (7th Cir. 1992); In re James Wilson Assoc., 965 F.2d 160, 166
   (7th Cir. 1992). Generally, an order finally resolving a separable
   controversy (for example, between one creditor and the debtor) is
   appealable even though the bankruptcy proceeding is not over. See In re
   Rimstat, Ltd., 212 F.3d 1039, 1044 (7th Cir. 2000); In re Official
   Committee of Unsecured Creditors of White Farm Equipment Co., 943 F.2d
   752 (7th Cir. 1991). But the decisions of both the district and
   bankruptcy courts must be final. In re Devlieg, Inc., 56 F.3d 32, 33
   (7th Cir. 1995) (per curiam); In re Klein, 940 F.2d 1075, 1077 (7th
   Cir. 1991); In re Behrens, 900 F.2d 97, 99 (7th Cir. 1990). A district
   court order remanding a case to the bankruptcy court is not final if
   further significant proceedings are contemplated. In re Stoecker, 5
   F.3d 1022, 1027 (7th Cir. 1993); In re Lytton's, 832 F.2d 395, 400 (7th
   Cir. 1987); In re Fox, 762 F.2d 54, 55 (7th Cir. 1985); see also In re
   Excello Press, Inc., 967 F.2d 1109, 1111 (7th Cir. 1992). Interlocutory
   orders of district courts sitting as appellate courts in bankruptcy are
   appealable if they meet the standards of 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292. Connecticut
   National Bank v. Germain, 112 S. Ct. 1146 (1992). The case law should
   be carefully reviewed to determine appealability. The court of appeals
   does not have jurisdiction to consider direct appeals from the
   bankruptcy court. In re Andy Frain Services, Inc., 798 F.2d 1113, 1124
   (7th Cir. 1986).

   (4) Administrative Agencies. The authority of courts of appeals to
   review the administrative order derives from statute. Alabama Tissue
   Center of the Univ. of Alabama Health Serv. Foundation, P.C. v.
   Sullivan, 975 F.2d 373, 376 (7th Cir. 1992); see, e.g., 28 U.S.C. ยง
   2342. An agency order remanding a case within the agency (for example,
   to an ALJ) for further consideration, or a district court order
   remanding a case to an agency, generally is not appealable unless the
   task on remand will be ministerial or (equivalently) involve just
   mechanical computations. Crowder v. Sullivan, 897 F.2d 252 (7th Cir.
   1990). If, however, a district court order will not be effectively
   reviewable by a petition to review the agency's final decision, it is
   appealable immediately. Id; Daviess County Hospital v. Bowen, 811 F.2d
   338, 341-42 (7th Cir. 1987).

   (III) Interlocutory Appeals.

   Where no final judgment has been entered, an appeal may be taken only
   if the order sought to be appealed falls within one of the statutory or
   judicial exceptions to the final judgment rule. Even when there is a
   right of interlocutory appeal, a party can wait till the case is over
   and then appeal, bringing before the court all non moot interlocutory
   rulings adverse to the party. Pearson v. Ramos, 237 F.3d 881, 883 (7th
   Cir. 2001). But see discussion below regarding entry of partial
   judgment under Rule 54(b).

   (1) Rule 54(b). Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
   allows (but does not require) a district judge to certify for immediate
   appeal an order that disposes of one or more but fewer than all of the
   claims or parties in a multiple claim or multiple party case. The
   district judge must expressly direct the entry of judgment and make an
   express determination that there is no just reason to delay the entry
   of judgment. The express findings required by the rule are
   indispensable to appealability. Willhelm v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., 927
   F.2d 971, 973 (7th Cir. 1991); Foremost Sales Promotions, Inc. v.
   Director, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 812 F.2d 1044 1046
   (7th Cir. 1987); Glidden v. Chromalloy American Corp., 808 F.2d 621,
   623 (7th Cir. 1986); see also <
