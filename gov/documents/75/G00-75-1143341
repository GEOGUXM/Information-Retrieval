   1.  Provide public education services with child, adult, and senior
   safety and injury prevention education through partnerships with allied
   agencies, educators, and Department members.  the Division also offers
   industrial safety training to the business community within the
   District.

   2.  Foster community relationships with community entities and the
   public by communicating the mission, goals, and performance of the
   Organization at community workshops, neighborhood meetings, outreach
   programs, and other public gatherings.

   3.  Act as the official information officer of the District by
   disseminating emergent and non-emergent information to the membership,
   the media, and the public.

   4.  Act as the recruitment arm of the District by seeking to
   continually improve the quality, representation, and capacity of the
