   CARDI is a research group at the Geophysics Institute, (Universidad
   Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; UNAM), that specializes in geologic
   applications of remote sensing techniques. http://132.248.6.242/

   The Center for Space Research Remote Sensing group is working toward
   the development of advanced image processing algorithms which can be
   applied to airborne and satellite imagery to better understand changes
   affecting the planet. http://www.csr.utexas.edu/rs/

   COOL's research focus is on New Jersey coastal waters, primarily within
   an area we call LEO-15. Since 1996 we have been acquiring data from
   above and below the ocean.

   The National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) - EPSCoR's
   Tropical Atmospheric Sciences Center (TASC), is aimed at understanding
   land and sea interactions with atmospheric compounds in tropical areas
   and climates. http://web.uprr.pr/epscor/nasa-epscor/

   Florida Environmental Research Institute is a center for computational
   ecology and remote sensing technologies. We are a non-profit research
   institute, incorporated in May 1998.  Our main research goal is to
   develop ecological forecast models for the coastal ocean in an effort
   to monitor and predict human and natural impacts on oceanographic
   systems.

   Remote Sensing Research provides educational institutions, government
   agencies, and non-profit corporations with remote sensing technology
   and services. For More Information Contact: Fred Nichols

   The dominant theme of the Sevilleta LTER program is to examine
   long-term changes in ecosystem attributes (e.g. population dynamics of
   plants and animals, nutrient cycling, hydrology, productivity, species
   diversity) as a result of both natural and human disturbances (e.g.
   global warming, acid rain, grazing, wildfires, droughts, and "El
   Niño"). Through these long-term studies, scientists will improve their
   understanding of the natural dynamics of ecosystems in the
   heterogeneous landscape of central New Mexico.

   The Special Program in Remote Sensing (PMPR), placed at the Universidad
   de Concepción (UdeC), is a research team whose main aims are project
   developing and supporting researchers, research teams, academic units
   and industry in areas of Remote Sensing, both satellital airborne and
   local "in situ" spectrometry, geographical information systems (GIS),
   specialized signal and image processing, advanced modeling and
   instrumentation. http://www.pmpr.udec.cl/index_ingles.html

   The Remote Sensing and Natural Resources Division of the Department of
   Geography, University of Zurich, is conducting active research and
   teaching in a wide range of topics in airborne and spaceborne remote
   sensing, including basic research, developments for operational
   processing and applications, and on natural resources such as land,
   biomass, water as well as natural hazards.
