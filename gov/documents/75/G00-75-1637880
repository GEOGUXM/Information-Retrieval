Section 508 Website Redesign

   The enhancements provided through this database driven website will
   provide increased functionality, usability and increased performance.
   Amongst our improved features include the search feature. We have
   incorporated an Advanced Search which includes the ability to search
   for a product using "any" or "all" of the keywords provided. You can
   now search only for products that have 508 templates, search by product
   group, and/or search by company name. The Search results will highlight
   the keyword term in a light blue, and will also include a small icon to
   distinguish products that include a 508 template. Most of the processes
   used within the secured Vendor Area of Buy Accessible have been scaled
   down to make the application more "User Friendly". For example,
   changing a user/product/division status can now be done in just one
   step, instead of four steps, by simply selecting a link next to the
   product's name. Deleting a user/product/division now requires only two
   steps instead of four, as found on the old site design. We've also
   included printer friendly options and convenient font and size layout
   controls for the site, as well as additional 508 related content.

   As always, we welcome your comments and suggestions as we continue to
   work towards future phases of development.
