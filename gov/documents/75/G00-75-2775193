   Noninvasive Medical Diagnostics and Treatment Research at the JPL's NDEAA

   [fmpul.jpg] This Website describes the JPL's NDEAA noninvasive medical
   diagnostics and treatment activity. This activity is conducted in
   cooperation with:
     * Dr. Michael Kabo and Jeffery Wang (M.D.), UCLA Medical Center
     * Dr. Jack Kovach, City of Hope
     * Hanspeter Loertscher,and Pete Grandia QMI, Costa Mesa, CA
     * Prof. Ajit Mal, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)
     * Robert Siegel (M.D.), Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC), Los
       Angeles, CA
     * Stacey Walker, University of Texas, Dallas

   Under the direction of Dr. Bar-Cohen, research is underway to
   investigate the various operative characteristics of high intensity
   ultrasound. To confine the wave, focused transducers are used, where
   high and low frequencies are modulated to take advantage of the
   focusing capability of high frequencies with the power that can be
   induced by low frequncies*. An experimental setup that was developed to
   harness the enabling capabilities of ultrasound was constructed and
   modified to allow data acquisition with the assistance of Stacey
   Walker. Cavitation, heating, steaming, and atomization were the
   phenomena that have been investigated.
   * Frequency Modulated High Power Ultrasound (FMPUL), Patent No.

  Demonstrations of high power focused ultrasonic mechanisms

   A demonstration was made during the JPL 2000 Invention Challenge,
   December 8, 2000. The demonstration was entitled "Plumbing-free water
   fountain using high-power focused ultrasonic waves."
