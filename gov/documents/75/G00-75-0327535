   Molecular Structure of Cancer-Related Proteins Identified

   Research published in the December 20, 2001, issue of Nature describes the
   molecular structure of two cancer-related proteins binding to one another.


   molecular structure of two cancer-related proteins binding

      January 7, 2002Scientists have identified the biochemical and
      signaling properties of two cancer-related proteins using a process
      called X-ray crystallography. The technique yielded the first-ever
      detailed pictures of the proteins interacting with each other,
      indicating which areas are most essential for the development of
      cancer.

      The X-ray crystallography of the proteins was conducted at the National
      Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at the Department of Energy's
      Brookhaven National Laboratory and at the Cornell University High
      Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). The light sources generate powerful
      X-rays, key to capturing the first detailed images of the proteins.

      The characterization of the structure may eventually be used to design
      novel drugs that interfere with the normal function of these proteins
      and prevent cancer growth. The work is the result of a scientific
      collaboration led by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.


                structure of the Eph-receptor/ephrin-ligand
     The crystal structure of the Eph-receptor/ephrin-ligand complex is
      displayed as a "ribbon" image. In the body, Eph B2 from one cell
    interacts with ephrin B2 from another cell to form a receptor-ligand
   complex, which serves as a communication link between the cells. A long
    loop from ephrin B2 (red/gold) anchored to Eph B2 seems to stabilize
     the complex. This loop may be the starting point for the design of
                    novel therapeutic agents for cancer.

      Tyrosine kinases are key enzymes responsible for communication between
      receptors on the cell's surface and pathways within the cell.
      Researchers determined the structure of an Eph receptor tyrosine kinase
      bound to its corresponding ligand molecule called ephrin. Interactions
      between Eph receptors and their specific ephrins lead to an array of
      cellular processes, including those that regulate cell proliferation,
      survival, adhesion, and movement. They are especially important in
      angiogenesisthe development of new blood vessels essential for the
      progression of cancer.

      According to the authors, the structural detail of the complex provides
      a framework for the development of potential drugs that could block Eph
      signaling. "Given the importance of Eph receptor kinases and ephrins in
      cardiovascular function, nerve regeneration, and cancer, the results
      could be the first step towards the future development of novel
      therapeutic strategies," said Dimitar Nikolov, PhD, head of the
      Structural Biology and Neuroscience Laboratory at Memorial
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and senior author of the study.

      The research team cloned the Eph and ephrin mouse genes, expressed the
      corresponding proteins in bacteria, and then purified them into
      miniscule crystals that diffract when bombarded with high energy
      X-rays. Researchers recorded the diffraction spots on a sophisticated
      camera and used a powerful computer to analyze the way in which the
      atoms scattered the X-rays. The resulting data were used to produce a
      three-dimensional picture of the proteins.

      "The sample is continuously rotated to get a series of diffraction
      patterns. Mathematical analysis of these patterns provided details that
      help explain the development of cancer," said Brookhaven
      crystallographer and study co-author Kanagalaghatta Rajashankar.

      The image clearly shows a channel in a specific surface area of the
      receptor. The channel has a high affinity towards the ligand, which
      contains a loop that penetrates deep into the channel causing slight
      structural changes and initiating processes that determine the fate of
      the cells, including the formation of blood vessels.

      "Our results may be used to discover and develop small molecules
      resembling the natural ligand, competing with the binding process and
      ultimately preventing the growth of cancer," said Juha-Pekka Himanen,
      PhD, research associate at Memorial Sloan-Kettering and lead author of
      the paper.

      Scientists from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at
      Dallas, and the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia also contributed
      to the research.
