   Seaflux from Space is an information system designed to devise,
   display, and disseminate spacebased ocean-atmosphere fluxes of
   momentum, heat and water.

   In the first phase (November 1999), Seaflux provides, at
   near-real-time, twice-daily maps of ocean surface winds over global
   oceans, derived from the observations by the scatterometer SeaWinds on
   space mission QuikSCAT, of the National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration (NASA). From these maps, emerging marine weather systems
   can be monitored. Regional pictures of tropical cyclones using a
   combination of wind from Quikscat and rain from the Tropical Rain
   Measuring Mission (TRMM) will also be displayed to illustrate the
   interplay between the dynamic and hydrologic parameters. Starting
   February 2000, uniformly gridded near-real-time data products can be
   extracted from the ftp sites. Improved scientific products will be
   available in delayed mode for online access after the improvement on
   SeaWinds Geophysical Model Function becomes more stable.

   [seaflux_s.gif] This information center was built with the supports of
   the NASA Physical Oceanography Program, the NOAA/NASA Enhanced Data
   Sets for Climate Changes Program, and the NASA Earth Observing System
   Interdisciplinary Science Program. The QuikSCAT Project at JPL and the
   TRMM Project at GSFC kindly provide the SeaWinds and TRMM data in
   near-real-time.

   W. Timothy Liu and Wenqing Tang are the co-investigators.
