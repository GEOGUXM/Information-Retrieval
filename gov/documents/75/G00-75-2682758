       at NIH or other government position.

   Why did you receive the invitation?
     * Based on general expertise, work from another employer, or
       government work which was finished and released to the public more

       information, or done yesterday.
     * This is OK to do in a public forum, (e.g., a widely attended event
       where the press is not excluded) rather than in a restricted,
       nonpublic environment. Sharing information with a diverse audience
       ensures that no one entity receives an unfair advantage.

       job, or else it must be 12 months old and previously released to
       the public in some official manner (e.g., an official abstract,
       article, or speech). Contact your IC EC for exceptions for teaching
       related to current job.

       check with your IC EC.

   Resources:
     * May use Government time and equipment to prepare for the activity.
     * Your secretary can assist in preparation for the activity (e.g.,
       slides, copying materials).

       the activity. (There is an exception for some scientific

       him/her personally, work is done on his/her own time, and no
       Government resources (time or equipment) are used.
