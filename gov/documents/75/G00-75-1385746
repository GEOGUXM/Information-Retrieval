Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Programs

   The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is a set-aside
   program (2.5% of an agency's extramural budget) for domestic small
   business concerns to engage in Research/Research and Development
   (R/R&D) that has the potential for commercialization. The SBIR program
   was established under the Small Business Innovation Development Act of
   1982 (P.L. 97-219), reauthorized until September 30, 2000 by the Small
   Business Research and Development Enhancement Act (P.L. 102-564), and
   reauthorized again until September 30, 2008 by the Small Business
   Reauthorization Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-554).

   Federal agencies with extramural research and development budgets over
   $100 million are required to administer SBIR programs using an annual
   set-aside of 2.5% for small companies to conduct innovative research or
   research and development (R/R&D) that has potential for
   commercialization and public benefit. Currently, ten Federal agencies
   participate in the SBIR program: the Departments of Health and Human
   Services (DHHS), Agriculture (USDA), Commerce (DOC), Defense (DOD),
   Education (DoED), Energy (DOE), and Transportation (DOT); the
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Aeronautics and
   Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF).
   To date, over $10 billion has been awarded by the SBIR program to
   various small businesses.

   The STTR program was established by the Small Business Technology
   Transfer Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-564, Title II), reauthorized until
   the year 2001 by the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 (P.L.
   105-135), and reauthorized again until September 30, 2009, by the Small
   Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act of 2001 (P.L.
   107-50).

   Federal agencies with extramural R&D budgets over $1 billion are
   required to administer STTR programs using an annual set-aside of
   0.15%. The set-aside will increase to 0.3 percent in FY 2004.
   Currently, five Federal agencies participate in the STTR program: DOD,
   DOE, DHHS (NIH), NASA and NSF. In fiscal year (FY) 2001 (October 1,
   2000-September 30, 2001), the NIH made SBIR grant and contract awards
   totaling $411 million and STTR grant awards totaling $24 million.
   Objectives. The SBIR Program includes the following objectives: using
   small businesses to stimulate technological innovation, strengthening
   the role of small business in meeting Federal R/R&D needs, increasing
   private sector commercialization of innovations developed through
   Federal SBIR R&D, increasing small business participation in Federal
   R/R&D, and fostering and encouraging participation by socially and
   economically disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned
   business concerns in the SBIR program. The STTR and SBIR programs are
   similar in that both programs seek to increase the participation of
   small businesses in Federal R&D and to increase private sector
   commercialization of technology developed through Federal R&D. The
   unique feature of the STTR program is the requirement for the small
   business concern applicant organization to formally collaborate with a
   research institution in Phase I and Phase II.

   Differences between SBIR and STTR. The SBIR and STTR programs differ in
   two major ways. First, under SBIR Program, the Principal Investigator
   must have his/her primary employment with the small business concern at
   the time of award and for the duration of the project period, however,
   under the STTR Program, primary employment is not stipulated. Second,
   the STTR Program requires research partners at universities and other
   non-profit research institutions to have a formal collaborative
   relationship with the small business concern. At least 40 percent of
   the STTR research project is to be conducted by the small business
   concern and at least 30 percent of the work is to be conducted by the
   single, "partnering" research institution.

   Structure of the SBIR and STTR Programs. The SBIR/STTR Programs are
   structured in three phases.

   Phase I. The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit
   and feasibility of the proposed R/R&D efforts and to determine the
   quality of performance of the small business awardee organization prior
   to providing further Federal support in Phase II. Support under Phase I
   is normally provided for six months/$100,000 for SBIR and one
   year/$100,000 for STTR. However, applicants may propose longer periods
   of time and greater amounts of funds necessary for completion of the
   project.

   Phase II. The objective of Phase II is to continue the R/R&D efforts
   initiated in Phase I. Only Phase I awardees are eligible for a Phase II
   award. Support under Phase II is normally provided for two
   years/$750,000 for SBIR and two years/$500,000 for STTR. However,
   applicants may propose longer periods of time and greater amounts of
   funds necessary for completion of the project.

   Applicants are very strongly encouraged to contact Institute/Center
   Program Staff before submitting an application in which the budget
   and/or project period deviates from the SBIR or STTR statutory
   guidelines. While the Phase I and Phase II award levels are guidelines
   that allow for applicants to propose a budget and project period
   appropriate for completion of the research project, deviations from the
   guidelines should be discussed with appropriate NIH staff listed in the
   Awarding Component/Agency Contact Information Table prior to submission
   of the application.

   Phase III. The objective of Phase III, where appropriate, is for the
   small business concern to pursue with non-SBIR/STTR funds the
   commercialization objectives resulting from the Phase I/II R/R&D
   activities. In some Federal agencies, Phase III may involve follow-on
   non-SBIR/STTR funded R&D or production contracts for products,
   processes or services intended for use by the U.S. Government.

   In what areas is NIH interested? The National Institutes of Health
   (NIH) welcomes SBIR and STTR applications from small businesses in any
   biomedical or behavioral research area that falls within our mission,
   which is to improve human health. Areas of interest are described in
   the solicitations below. Applicants are encouraged to subscribe to the
   NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts and to visit the websites of our
   Institutes and Centers to learn of emerging interests and areas of high
   priority.
