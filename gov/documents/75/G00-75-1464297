   ORAL ARGUMENT SCHEDULED FOR FEBRUARY 26 & 27, 2001 No. 00-5212
   (Consolidated with No. 00-5213) IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
   FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT ______________________________
   UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. MICROSOFT CORPORATION,
   Defendant-Appellant. _______________________________ ON APPEAL FROM THE
   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA No. 98-1232
   (TPJ) Hon. Thomas Penfield Jackson, United States District Judge
   ______________________________ MOTION OF LAURA BENNETT PETERSON, AMICUS
   CURIAE, FOR LEAVE TO FILE ACCOMPANYING BRIEF OUT OF TIME
   ______________________________ I, amicus curiae Laura Bennett Peterson,
   hereby respectfully move for leave to file the accompanying
   Court-authorized brief on January 22, 2001. As the accompanying
   Declaration attests, this filing after the January 12 deadline is
   occasioned by a condition yielding significantly impaired vision.
   Because this condition, which my ophthalmologist's technical associate
   ascribes to severe eye strain, could not effectively be treated or
   remedied, but must resolve itself over time on its own, I was
   regrettably incapacitated, despite sustained effort to the best of my
   ability, from completing my brief until this time. This condition,
   which has associated physical symptoms, arose prior to the January 12
   deadline, was at its worst from January 12 through January 15, and
   continues to cause discomfort and significant incapacity (including
   blurred vision and difficulty in reading and writing) to this day.
   Since I work on my own, it has not been possible to have anyone else
   complete and submit my brief while I have been incapacitated. I have
   consulted with counsel for the parties about this Motion, which none of
   them oppose. Microsoft Corporation, through its counsel Bradley P.
   Smith, indicated to me in a telephone discussion on January 17 that it
   has no objection to my filing out of time. The United States, through
   its counsel Catherine G. O'Sullivan, noted in a telephone conversation
   with me on January 18 that this Court's Order of October 11, 2000
   (issued prior to the November 3, 2000 Order granting amici's motions
   for leave to participate, but referenced in that prior Order) "may not
   contemplate," in her words, motions for the extensions of deadlines;
   nonetheless, the United States does not object to my Motion herein to
   file my amicus brief out of time. The States, through their counsel
   Richard L. Schwartz, with whom I spoke by telephone on January 18,
   concur with the U.S. Department of Justice's position and also do not
   object to this Motion to file out of time. Appellees' position remains
   consistent, then, I believe, with that expressed in their Joint
   Responses to Motions Regarding Amicus Participation, filed October 30,
   2000: "We support the Court's permitting any amicus filings that it
   would find helpful." As the government Appellees noted in their own
   January 18, 2001 Motion for Enlargement of Time to File CD-ROM, they
   too are governed by the above-referenced Orders dated October 11, 2000
   and November 3, 2000, including the deadlines therein. This Court 2
   demonstrated its understanding of the extenuating circumstances that
   underlay their Motion for Enlargement of Time in its Order granting
   their Motion on January 19. My brief, prompted by my interest and
   concern over decades in antitrust law and economics, will, I believe,
   assist the Court by providing a perspective, not developed in the other
   participants' briefs, on the critical concept of an "applications
   barrier to entry," as well as on remedies. My brief, unlike the briefs
   filed prior to January 12, also considers the implications of the
   district court's bifurcation of findings and conclusions, along with
   the implications of the mixed questions of law and fact that this case
   presents. Because of my condition, I have not even read, let alone
   based any part of my brief on, any brief filed on January 12. The
   acceptance of my brief at this time would not set back the schedule for
   filing any other brief or prejudice any of the other participants.
   Microsoft Corporation, which alone has the right to file another
   substantive brief, would not be harmed were this Motion to be granted,
   since I support its request for relief and it will have a week to
   consider my position before it files its Reply Brief on January 29. I
   recognize and regret the burden on the Court of considering this
   Motion. At the same time, for the reasons presented above, I
   respectfully request that the Court grant my Motion for Leave to File
   the Accompanying Brief Out of Time. Respectfully submitted,
