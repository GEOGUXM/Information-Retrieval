                      [xlogo.gif] X Terminals at Fermilab

   [default.bar.gif]

   The Computing Division no longer recommends buying X terminals. PC's
   have been determined to be more cost effective. However, the last
   recommended product lines, Network Computing Devices NCD, and Tektronix
   TekXPress , are still supported. Hewlett Packard Envizex and DEC
   VXT2000 terminals have also been reviewed but not placed on the
   recommended list.
