      Enrolling in Easysaver is child's play!

      Signing up is as easy as 1, 2, 3:
       1. Either fill out the EasySaver enrollment form online using your
          computer, then print it out and sign it -- or --print the form
          first and fill it out by hand. Both options require Adobe Acrobat,
          available for free download and installation
       2. Attach to the form a voided check from your checking account or a
          deposit slip from your savings account. We need this to start
          electronic debits.
       3. Sign and mail the form. For accounts that have more than one owner,
          have all owners sign the form.

        * Allow four weeks for the first debit to occur, and two weeks for
          delivery of the savings bonds following each scheduled debit. Keep
          a copy of your order for your records. Keep the order confirmation
          we will send you. If you misplace it, see customer service
          information, below.

      Other ways to sign up for EasySaver:
        * We can send the form to you through the mail.
        * Call 1-877-811 SAVE (Toll-Free) and mention key code 07 to order an
          enrollment form over the phone.
