                   Coordinated Data Analysis Web (CDAWeb)

          Public data from current and past space physics missions
     __________________________________________________________________

   The full CDAWeb data service with multiple database views directly
   supports graphics, digital listings and simultaneous multi-mission,
   multi-instrument selection and comparison of science data among a wide
   range of current space missions, including ACE, Cluster, Equator-S,
   FAST, Geotail, IMAGE, IMP-8, ISTP (Polar and Wind), Interball (Tail and
   Aurora), SAMPEX, SOHO and Ulysses. CDAWeb also supports data from
   geosynchronous satellites including GOES 6/7/8/9/10 and LANL
   1989/1990/1991/1994/1997; from ground-based facilities including
   CANOPUS, DARN, the Finnish Meteorological Institute and SESAME; from
   older space missions including Dynamics Explorer (DE-1, DE-2), Hawkeye,
   and ISIS; and for key data dedicated to use by specific science teams,
   including the Cluster Prime Parameters.

   Please select one or more data sources, OR one or more instrument
   types, OR a combination of data sources and instrument types from those
   data sources, and then click "Submit".
