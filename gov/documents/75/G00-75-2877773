       1. What is a DAAC?
          DAAC is an acronym for "Distributed Active Archive Center", and
          PO.DAAC is the acronym for Physical Oceanography DAAC. As
          components of the EOS Data Information System (EOSDIS), DAACs are
          institutions that generate EOS standard products and carry out
          NASA's responsibilities for data archive, distribution, and
          management. Many of these sites also carry products that pre-date
          EOS.
       2. How much does PO.DAAC data cost?
          All PO.DAAC holdings are free of charge to scientists, educators
          and the community at large. However, anything freely obtained from
          PO.DAAC may not be redistributed for profit.
       3. How do I cite PO.DAAC Data in my publication?
          When PO.DAAC data are used in a publication, we request that the
          following acknowledgement be given: "These data were obtained from
          the NASA Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center at
          the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology".
          We also request a reprint of any papers or reports published using
          data from the JPL PO.DAAC. These reprints will be used in our
          reference archives as well as in the determination of future
          PO.DAAC products.
       4. How long does it take to get PO.DAAC data?
          If you ordered an off-the-shelf item such as a CD-ROM and your
          mailing address is in the United States, your data should arrive
          within one week. If you ordered data on tape or if your mailing
          address is outside of the U.S., your data should arrive within a
          few weeks.
       5. How do I find out when new data is available?
          Bulletins on the availability of most new data at the JPL PO.DAAC
          are sent to the PO.DAAC Mailing List.
       6. What PO.DAAC products are distributed on CD-ROM?
          Several products are available via CD-ROM. Please refer to the
          PO.DAAC Data Catalog and Order Form for more information.
       7. Are PO.DAAC holdings available via FTP?
          Many of the PO.DAAC data products are available via anonymous FTP
          to podaac.jpl.nasa.gov in the pub/ directory. Instructions on using
          anonymous FTP are also available on-line.
       8. Some of the data files on the PO.DAAC FTP site are not compressed.
          How can I compress them before transfer?
          The PO.DAAC FTP Site uses the Washington University FTP server.
          This server supports a number of features including TAR and
          Compressed data transfers. For more information, please refer to
          the PO.DAAC FTP Site Utilities section of the FTP web page.
       9. What is HDF?
          HDF, Hierarchical Data Format, is a library and platform
          independent data format for the storage and exchange of scientific
          data. HDF is developed and supported by the National Center for
          Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), and is freely available. The
          HDF library and further information on HDF is available at the NCSA
          HDF Home Page (http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/).
          HDF software mirror sites also exist at:
             + NASA Goddard Space Flight Center:
               Host Name: daac.gsfc.nasa.gov
               Location: software/hdf
               Homepage: http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/
               REFERENCE_DOCS/HDF/gdaac_hdf.html
             + DLR German Remote Sensing Data Center:
               Host Name: ftp.dfd.dlr.de
               Location: software/hdf
             + ATMOS User Center at the German Remote Sensing Data Center:
               Web Page: http://auc.dfd.dlr.de/HDF
      10. How do I get images of TOPEX/Poseidon data?
          TOPEX/Poseidon images are available on the PO.DAAC TOPEX/Poseidon
          home page (http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/topex/)
          Selected hard copy images are available from the TOPEX project
          office at JPL;susan.digby@jpl.nasa.gov (ph 818 354-0151).
      11. Does the PO.DAAC still distribute the West Coast Time series data?
          The West Coast Time Series is no longer available at the PO.DAAC.
          The data is now distributed by the investigator, Mark Abott
          (mabbott@oce.orst.edu).
      12. Does the PO.DAAC have educational materials?
          The PO.DAAC provides has a listing of educational resources which
          are available at other institutions. We also distribute a limited
          number of educational data products. Please refer to our Education
          page for more information.
      13. Is there a comprehensive listing of data held by the DAACs, NOAA
          and other archives?
          The Global Change Master Directory (http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/) is
          an extensive directory of descriptive and locational information
          about data sets relevant to global change research. The GCMD
          currently holds descriptions of datasets from over 470 government
          agencies, research institutions, archives and universities
          worldwide.
      14. Where can I get other JPL- related information?
          Information about other JPL missions is available on the JPL web
          site (http://www.jpl.nasa.gov).
      15. What is the IMS?
          The Version 0 Information Management System (V0 IMS) provides
          "one-stop-shopping" access to the data holdings at all the EOSDIS
          DAACs and participating data centers from other U.S. and
          international agencies. The V0 IMS permits users to access EOSDIS
          archives, browse data holdings, select data products or their
          subsets (for products where the capability is available), and place
          data orders.
