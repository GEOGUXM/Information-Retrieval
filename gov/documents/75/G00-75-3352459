   FIRE D. Meade Presented at Los Alamos National Laboratory Los Alamos,
   NM April 3, 2001 FIRE Lighting the Way to Fusion Fusion is an
   Outstanding Physics Challenge and is Connected to Other Outstanding
   Challenges Ten Outstanding Physics Challenges December 1999 DMM *
   Quantum gravity presents the ultimate challenge to theorists *
   Explaining high-Tc superconductors * Unstable nuclei reveal the need
   for a complete theory of the nucleus * Realizing the potential of
   fusion energy * Climate prediction is heavy weather * Turbulence nears
   a final answer * Glass physics: still not transparent * Solar magnetic
   field poses problems * Complexity, catastrophe and physics DMM *
   Consciousness: the physicists view Outline and Main Points Rational,
   Mission, Requirements and Readiness for Burning Plasma Experiment * a
   compelling case must be made that has broad support * UFA Wkp, NSO-PAC
   and FESAC will help define mission and requirements FIRE Scientific
   Basis and Performance Projections * evolving in response to community
   input * Q ~ 10 for 1.5 skin times is goal (requires 7.7 MA @ 10T if
   ITER98H(y,2)) * add advanced tokamak (RS) capability FIRE Engineering
   Basis * Baseline wedged BeCu design meets new goals * Looking for
   improvements - e.g., bucked and wedged TF Plans Magnetic Fusion Science
   Issues - Strongly Coupled in a Fusion (Burning) Plasma Transport Macro
   Stability Burning Plasma Wave Particle Edge Improved Capability (more
   advanced) Fusion Conditions { ( , , ), edge, P /PH} External- heating
   Self-heating (control) (Self organization) Burning Plasma Physics is
   Widely Accepted as the Primary Objective for a Next Step in Fusion
   Science * Grunder Panel (98) and Madison Forum endorsed Burning Plasmas
   as next step. * NRC Interim Report (99) identified "integrated physics
   of a self-heated plasma" as one of the critical unresolved fusion
   science issues. * The Snowmass Fusion Summer Study (99) endorsed the
   burning plasma physics objective, and that the tokamak was technically
   ready for high-gain experiment. A burning plasma experiment should also
   have advanced tokamak capability. * SEAB (99) noted that "There is
   general agreement that the next large machine should, at least, be one
   that allows the scientific exploration of burning plasmas" and if Japan
   and Europe do not proceed with ITER "the U. S. should pursue a less
   ambitious machine that will allow the exploration of the relevant
   science at lower cost." ..... "In any event the preliminary planning
   for such as machine should proceed now so as to allow the prompt
   pursuit of this option." * NRC/FuSAC (00) - "The US scientific
   community needs to take the lead in articulating the goals of an
   achievable, cost-effective scientific burning plasma experiment, and to
   develop flexible strategies to achieve it, including international
   collaboration." NSO/FIRE Community Discussions A Proactive NSO/FIRE
   Outreach Program has been undertaken to solicit comments and
   suggestions from the community on the next step in magnetic fusion. *

   accessible and up to date. Over 18,000 visitors from around the world
   have logged on to the FIRE web site since the site was initiated in
   July, 1999. UFA Workshop on Burning Plasma Science First Workshop - 90
   participants- December 11-13, 2000 University of Texas * Extension of
   Madison Forum, Snowmass discussions on burning plasmas. * Focused on
   Sciences Issues for/by burning plasmas * Five Science Issue Breakout
   groups were established: 1. Energetic Alpha Particles Issues for a
   Burning Plasma 2. Confinement, Transport and Self-heating in Burning
   Plasma 3. Macrostability in a Burning Plasma 4. Boundary Plasma Science
   5. Relationship of Burning Plasma Science to Other Fields * Strong
   nonlinear coupling that will occur in a strongly burning plasma was an
   overall theme. Action Item - need to develop a more compelling case. *
   Some sentiment that a BP might be boring, that is, extrapolation too
   small from existing parameters. Others, expressed concern that strongly
   burning plasmas in an AT configuration with high bootstrap would be
   uncontrollable. Several areas identified where tokamak BP would shed
   light on understanding science issues for other configurations. Next

   General Atomics, San Diego, CA. January 17-18, 2001 at MIT, Cambridge,
   MA July 11-12, 2001 at Univ. Wisc, Madison, WI * Charge for First and
   Second meetings Scientific value of a Burning Plasma experiment
   Scientific readiness to proceed with such an experiment Is the FIRE
   mission scientifically appropriate? Is the initial FIRE design point
   optimal? * Extensive PAC Reports provide detailed recommendations for
   the FIRE activity to address. NSO-PAC reports are on FIRE
   (http://fire.pppl.gov), will discuss in more detail under FY 2001-03
   Plans. Common Themes Emerging from NSO-PAC, UFA Workshop and Community
   Discussions Scientific Basis an experiment with flexibility, affordable
   first step with capability for later upgrades . able to access fusion
   dominated (P /Pheat 50%) increased Ip 6.44 MA to 7.7 MA reduced aspect
   ratio to 3.6 plasma sustained at least 1 -2 skin times increased size R
   = 2.0m to 2.14m address issues central to fusion science developing AT
   scenario for FIRE Technical Basis and Status LN Cu coil tokamak can
   satisfy the scientific requirements. What is the optimum config.?
   Baseline Wedged (BeCu) design meets requirem`ts, will start peer review
   critical systems. Beginning design of a Bucked and Wedged (Cu)
   Configuration. Internal hardware and PFCs are a common challenge for
   tokamaks and other MF configs. Community Involvement Must develop a
   more exciting and compelling case for a next step magnetic fusion
   exp`t. Presently an outreach emphasis, must transition to greater
   community involvement. UFA workshops, Science Initiatives for NSO, etc
   are opportunities for progress. Vision and Mission for a Major Next

   Current Quench Recent Innovations have Markedly Improved the Technical
   Basis for a Compact High Field Tokamak Burning Plasma Exp't. Tokamak
   experiments (1989-1999) have developed enhanced confinement modes that
   scale (e.g.,ITER-98H) 1.3 times higher than the 1989 CIT design
   assumption. Alcator C-Mod - the prototype for Compact High Field
   tokamaks has shown: * Confinement in excess of 1.4 times the 1989
   design guidelines for CIT and ~1.15 times the recent ITER-98H design
   guidelines. * Successful ICRF heating at high density in shaped
   diverted plasmas. * Successful detached divertor operation at high
   power density. D-T experiments on TFTR and JET have shown: * Tritium
   can be handled safely in a laboratory fusion experiment!!! * D-T
   plasmas behaved roughly as predicted with slight improvements in
   confinement in plasmas with weak alpha-heating. Engineering Innovations

   2015 Year * Even with ITER, the MFE program will be unable to address
   the alpha-dominated burning plasma issues for 15 years. * Compact
   High-Field Tokamak Burning Plasma Experiment(s) would be a natural
   extension of the ongoing "advanced" tokamak program and could begin
   alpha- dominated experiments by ~ 10 years. * More than one high gain
   burning plasma facility is needed in the world program. * The
   information "exists now" to make a technical assessment, and decision
   on MFE burning plasma experiments for the next decade. Timetable for a

   * Exploration, understanding and optimization of fusion-dominated
   (high-gain) burning plasmas are critical issues for all approaches to
   fusion. * The tokamak is a cost-effective vehicle to investigate
   fusion-dominated plasma physics and its coupling to advanced toroidal
   physics for MFE. The tokamak is technically ready for a next step to
   explore fusion plasma physics. * The FIRE compact high field tokamak
   can address the important fusion- dominated plasma issues, many of the
   long pulse advanced tokamak issues and begin the coupling of
   fusion-dominated plasmas with advanced toroidal physics in a $1B class
   facility. * The FIRE design point has been chosen to be a "stepping
   stone" between the physics accessible with present experiments and the
   physics required for the ARIES vision of magnetic fusion energy. * A
   plan is being developed for an Advanced Tokamak Next Step that will
   address physics, engineering and cost issues in FY 2000-2 with the goal
   of being ready to begin a Conceptual Design in 2003. Laboratories are
   Needed to Explore, Explain and Expand the Frontiers of Science CHANDRA
