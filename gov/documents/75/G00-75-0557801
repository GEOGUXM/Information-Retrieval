   Thackeray's Globules in IC 2944

   HUBBLE CAPTURES OPAQUE GLOBULES IN SPACE

   Strangely glowing, floating dark clouds are silhouetted against nearby
   bright stars in a busy star-forming region viewed by NASA's Hubble
   Space Telescope.

   The image showing dense, opaque dust clouds -- known as globules -- in
   the star-forming region IC 2944 is available online at:

   It was taken by Hubble's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2, designed
   and built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.

   Little is known about the origin and nature of these globules in IC
   2944, which were first found by astronomer A.D. Thackeray in 1950.
   Globules are generally associated with large hydrogen-emitting
   star-formation regions, which give off the glowing light of hydrogen
   gas.

   The largest globule in this image consists of two separate clouds that
   gently overlap along our line of sight. Each cloud is nearly 1.4
   light-years along its longest dimension. Collectively, they contain
   enough material to equal more than 15 times the mass of our Sun. The
   surrounding hydrogen-rich region, IC 2944, is filled with gas and dust
   illuminated and heated by a loose cluster of stars that are much hotter
   and more massive than our Sun. IC 2944 is relatively close by, only
   5,900 light-years away in the constellation Centaurus.

   Using the remarkable resolution of Hubble, astronomers can for the
   first time study the intricate structure of these globules. They appear
   to be heavily fractured, as if major forces were tearing them apart.
   When radio astronomers observed the faint hiss of molecules within the
   globules, they realized that the globules are actually in constant,
   churning motion, moving supersonically among each other. This may be
   caused by powerful ultraviolet radiation from the luminous, massive
   stars, which heat up hydrogen gas in the region. The gas expands and
   streams against the globules, leading to their destruction. Despite
   their serene appearance, the globules may actually be likened to clumps
   of butter put into a red-hot pan.

   The globules are most likely dense clumps of gas and dust that existed
   before the hot, massive stars were born. But once the stars began to
   irradiate and destroy their surroundings, the clumps became visible
   when their less dense surroundings were eroded away. This exposed them
   to the full brunt of the ultraviolet radiation and the expanding
   hydrogen-rich region. The new images catch a glimpse of the process of
   destruction.

   The hydrogen-emission image that clearly shows the outline of the dark
   globules was taken with Hubble's camera in February 1999 by Bo
   Reipurth, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, and collaborators. Additional
   broadband images that helped to establish the true color of the stars
   in the field were taken by the Hubble Heritage Team in February 2001.
   The composite result is a four-color image.

   The Space Telescope Science Institute is operated by the Association of
   Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., for NASA under contract
   with the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. The Hubble Space
   Telescope is a project of international cooperation between the
   European Space Agency and NASA. The California Institute of Technology
   in Pasadena manages JPL for NASA.
