    A. COHERENT, RAYLEIGH, OR ELASTIC SCATTERING

   Scattering from single electrons (Thomson scattering) has a total cross
   section

   [[Sec3102.gif] ]                           (1)

   where [[Sec3104.gif] ] is the classical radius of the electron,
   [[Sec3106.gif] ] [ [Sec3108.gif] ] meter. The angular distribution for
   unpolarized incident radiation is proportional to [[Sec3110.gif] ],
   where q is the scattering angle. For polarized incident radiation, the
   cross section vanishes at 90° in the plane of polarization.

   Scattering from atoms involves the cooperative effect of all the
   electrons, and the cross section becomes

   [[Sec3112.gif] ]             (2)

   where [[Sec3114.gif] ] is the (complex) atomic scattering factor,
   tabulated in Section 2.7 of this booklet. Up to about 2 keV, the
   scattering factor is approximately independent of scattering angle,
   with a real part that represents the effective number of electrons that
   participate in the scattering. At higher energies, the scattering
   factor falls off rapidly with scattering angle. For details see Ref. 1.

    B. COMPTON SCATTERING

   In relativistic quantum mechanics, the scattering of x-rays by a free
   electron is given by the Klein-Nishina formula. If we assume
   unpolarized x-rays and unaligned electrons, this formula can be
   approximated as follows for x-ray energies below 100 keV:

   where [[Sec3118.gif] ], the photon energy measured in units of the
   electron rest energy. The total cross section is approximately

   [[Sec3120.gif] ]                                   (4)

   Note that for very low energies [[Sec3122.gif] ], we recover the
   Thomson cross section. The real difference comes when we deal with
   atoms. In that case, if the scattering leaves the atom in the ground
   state, we deal with coherent scattering (see above), whereas if the
   electron is ejected from the atoms, the scattering is (incoherent)
   Compton scattering. At high energies, the total Compton cross section
   approaches [[Sec3124.gif] ]. At low energies and small scattering
   angles, however, binding effects are very important, the Compton cross
   section is significantly reduced, and coherent scattering dominates
   (see Figs. 3-1 and 3-2). For details see Refs. 1 and 2.

   The scattered x-ray suffers an energy loss, which (ignoring binding
   effects) is given by

   [[Sec3126.gif] ]                                             (5)

   or, in terms of the wavelength shift,

   [[Sec3128.gif] ]                                                (6)

   where [[Sec3130.gif] ].  The kinetic energy of the recoil electron is
   just the energy lost by the photon in this approximation:
