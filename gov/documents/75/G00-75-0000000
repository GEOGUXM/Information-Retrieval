   Congressional office closings delay mail delivery

              Please excuse any delay in responding to your letters. While
     congressional offices are now open, the recent closures significantly
          delayed our ability to respond to constituent mail that had been
   delivered before the closure, and no new mail has been delivered to our
                    office since the closure. We appreciate your patience.
