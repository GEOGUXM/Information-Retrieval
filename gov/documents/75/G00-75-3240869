               Governor's Office for Innovation in Government

                               At your service

   Governor Gray Davis created the Office for Innovation in Government to
   improve customer service in state practices and processes with direct
   and significant impact on Californians.

   Under the direction of Steve Nissen, Special Assistant to the Governor,
   the Innovation in Government staff includes some of the state's most
   distinguished employees who bring a vast amount of expertise from their
   respective agencies and departments. The Innovation in Government team
   also includes office support personnel, executive fellows, and student
   interns.

   Innovation in Government staff serves as a resource to state
   departments implementing their own service improvement initiatives. At
   any given time, Innovation in Government staff may assist state
   departments by serving as:
     * Integrator - bringing together different departments to implement
       effective inter-agency partnerships.
     * Sounding board - a friendly voice to provide helpful feedback about
       an improvement project, obstacle or opportunity.
     * Resource broker - not a bank, but a place to go to get ideas about
       how to fund an innovative approach to improving products or
       services.
     * Consultant - a repository of knowledge and expertise in the areas
       of quality improvement, customer service, strategic planning,
       communications, project management, organizational effectiveness
       and performance measurement.
     * Facilitator for improvement efforts - Several Innovation in
       Government staff members are expert meeting facilitators and can
       provide sound advice on how to get a project off the ground or out
       of a rut.

   The Innovation in Government office prides itself in helping initiate
   new innovation efforts and adding value to existing ones. The office
   also wants to help publicize real-world success stories where
   departments are slashing red tape, improving customer satisfaction and
   saving taxpayer dollars.

   Not only will publicizing these best practices help build confidence in
   the taxpayers that that their hard-earned dollars are being spent
   wisely, it encourages other state employees to learn about the latest
   innovative techniques and to identify improvement opportunities in
   their own areas.

   In the past the Innovation in Government staff have partnered with the
   Department of Motor Vehicles to pilot the enormously popular on-line
   vehicle registration system, and to craft a "DMV of the Future"
   initiative that looks at government services from the customer's point
   of view.

   For more information on how the Innovation in Government office can
   help your department, contact Russell Snyder at info@innovation.ca.gov,
   or at (916) 445-1176.
