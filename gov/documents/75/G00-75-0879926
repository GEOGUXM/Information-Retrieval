       understand and assess the extent of alcohol, drug abuse, and mental
       health disorders and the nature and impact of related treament
       systems. Based at the University of Michigan's Inter-university
       Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR).
     * The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
       (SAMHSA).
       SAMHSA's mission is to assure that quality substance abuse and
       mental health services are available to the people who need them
       and to ensure that prevention and treatment knowledge is used more
       effectively in the general health care system.
     * Substance Abuse Resource Center.
       The Substance Abuse Resource Center offers a wealth of data and
       reports on the abuse of alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs and efforts
       to prevent harm from their use from Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
       National Program Offices, grantees and other sources. It also
       features the latest edition of a groundbreaking new study,
       "Substance Abuse: The Nation's Number One Health Problem--Key
       Indicators for Policy." This thought-provoking report tracks
       smoking, drinking, and illicit drug use over several decades.
     * The UCLA Drug Abuse Research Center (DARC)
       The Drug Abuse Research Center (DARC) is a diverse research
       organization that investigates psychosocial and epidemiological
       issues pertaining to drug use and conducts evaluations of
       interventions for drug dependence. The group's portfolio of studies
       has provided findings that have improved the understanding of the
       complex nature of drug use and dependence; DARC findings have been
       useful in developing more effective strategies for dealing with
       drug-related problems through prevention, treatment, and criminal
       justice approaches.
     * U.S. Department of Labor - Workplace Substance Abuse
       The U.S. Department of Labor is charged with preparing the American
       workforce for new and better jobs, and ensuring the adequacy of
       America's workplaces. It is responsible for the administration and
       enforcement of over 180 federal statutes. These legislative
       mandates and the regulations produced to implement them cover a
       wide variety of workplace activities for nearly 10 million
       employers and well over 100 million workers, including protecting
       workers' wages, health and safety, employment and pension rights;
       promoting equal employment opportunity; administering job training,
       unemployment insurance and workers' compensation programs;
       strengthening free collective bargaining and collecting, analyzing
       and publishing labor and economic statistics.
     * VA Medical Center, PET Imaging
       The state-of-the-art Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Center at
       the Minneapolis VA Medical Center (VAMC) became operational in
       November, 1991. This facility, which houses a 40 MeV Scanditronics
       cyclotron, a Siemens ECAT tomograph with retractable septa and an
       extensive Sun computer network, is maintained and operated by the
       PET Imaging Service, which includes both VAMC and University of
       Minnesota staff.
     * Web of Addictions
       The Web of Addictions is dedicated to providing accurate
       information about alcohol and other drug addictions. We developed
       the Web of Addictions for several reasons. We are concerned about
       the pro drug use messages in some Web sites and in some use groups.
       We are concerned about the appalling extent of misinformation about
       abused drugs on the internet, particularly on some usenet news
       groups. Finally, we wanted to provide a resource for teachers,
       students and others who needed factual information about abused
       drugs.
     * Youth Info Home Page
       YouthInfo, a new information resource developed by the U.S.
       Department of Health and Human Services to provide you with the
       latest information about America's adolescents.
