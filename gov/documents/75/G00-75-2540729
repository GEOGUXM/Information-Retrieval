                             COMPLIANCE DIRECTIVE FOR
                       BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS STANDARD UPDATED
       Includes revisions mandated by the Needlestick Safety and Prevention
                                        Act

      WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Occupational Safety and Health Administration
      today issued a new compliance directive for enforcing the bloodborne
      pathogens standard that was revised in January.The standard became
      effective on April 18.

      The compliance directive guides OSHA's safety and health inspection
      officers in enforcing the standard that covers occupational exposure to
      blood and other potentially infectious materials, and ensures
      consistent inspection procedures are followed. It updates an earlier
      directive issued in 1999 and incorporates changes mandated by the
      Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act passed in November 2000.

      The directive implements changes made to the standard that focus on the
      requirement that employers select safer needle devices as they become
      available and involve employees in identifying and choosing those
      devices. The standard now also requires most employers to maintain a
      log of injuries from contaminated sharps.

      The directive highlights the major new requirements of the standard
      including: (1) evaluation and implementation of safer needle devices as
      part of the re-evaluation of appropriate engineering controls during an
      employer's annual exposure control plan; (2) documentation of the
      involvement of non-managerial, frontline employees in choosing safer
      devices; and (3) establishment and maintenance of a sharps injury log
      for recording injuries from contaminated sharps.

      Compliance officers are reminded that no one safer medical device is
      appropriate for all situations; employers must consider and implement
      devices that are appropriate, commercially available and effective. The
      directive also includes detailed instructions on inspections of
      multi-employer worksites, including employment agencies, personnel
      services, home health services, physicians and healthcare professionals
      in independent practices, and independent contractors.

      Also included in the directive are engineering control evaluation
      forms, a web site resource list, a model exposure control plan which
      incorporates the most current guidelines from the Centers for Disease
      Control regarding management of occupational exposure to the hepatitis
      B and C viruses, and the HIV virus.

      The directive can be accessed from the OSHA website at
