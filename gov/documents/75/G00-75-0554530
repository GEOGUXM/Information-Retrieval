   Collage - Why Study Ice Cores?
   Ice cores contain an abundance of climate information --more so than
   any other natural recorder of climate such as tree rings or sediment
   layers. Although their record is short (in geologic terms), it can be
   highly detailed. An ice core from the right site can contain an
   uninterrupted, detailed climate record extending back hundreds of
   thousands of years. This record can include temperature, precipitation
   , chemistry and gas composition of the lower atmosphere, volcanic
   eruptions, solar variability, sea-surface productivity and a variety of
   other climate indicators. It is the simultaneity of these properties
   recorded in the ice that makes ice cores such a powerful tool in
   paleoclimate research.
