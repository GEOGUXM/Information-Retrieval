   Incident Management
   IEEE Incident Management Standards Working Group (IMWG) Meeting
   October 23-24, 2001
   Chantilly, VA (suburban Washington, DC)

   The IEEE IMWG will meet on October 23-24 with the goal of bringing two
   new standards in the 1512 (Incident Management) family of standards to
   ballot readiness.

   Last year, the Incident Management Base Standard "IEEE Standard for
   Common Incident Management Message Sets for Use by Emergency Management
   Centers" (IEEE 1512-2000) was formally approved by IEEE. That standard
   contains 18 messages divided in 3 sets - Status Message Set, Incident
   Management Message Set, and Center Message Set. Since then work has
   proceeded on 4 new standards:
   1512.1 - Traffic Management message sets used in traffic incident
   management.
   1512.2 - Public Safety message sets used in traffic incident
   management.
   1512.3 - Hazardous Materials message sets used in traffic incident
   management.
   1512.a - Emergency Management Data Dictionary for data elements in all
   volumes of 1512.

   The Traffic Management (1512.1) and Hazardous Materials (1512.3) are
   nearing completion and are expected to be balloted this year. Working
   is continuing on the Public Safety (1512.2) and Emergency Management
   Data Dictionary with completion expected in 2002. The Incident
   Management Working Group is made up of transportation and public safety
   professionals from law enforcement, fire and rescue, hazardous
   materials and emergency medical disciplines.

   services and transportation. The first meeting of the panel will be
