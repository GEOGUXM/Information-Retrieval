        (ICM) and the Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR) have
        partnered to create a streamlined solution for integrating ADWRs
        Imaged Records Database for data distribution via the web through a
        searchable user-friendly browser interface.  Users can search and
        download relevant data within PowerWeb such as Wells 55 data. As
        PowerWeb develops, additional data and topics will be added.

   PowerWeb Disclaimer

     The data from the Wells55 Registry currently available from PowerWeb
     is for informational purposes only.  Well information is collected
     and reported by the respective owner of each well and is not field
     verified.  Users are encouraged to contact the Arizona Department of
     Water Resources if you need well data for a professional purpose.
     The ADWR Imaged Records Database for online access to water-related
     information is under development. It is in an early stage; in
     subsequent stages, the system will be capable of providing more
     varied and complete information than is available at this time. Our
     staff has access to more information and will be happy to assist
     you. Contact: ADWR Records 602 417-2405.
