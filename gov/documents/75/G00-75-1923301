                          Fossil Energy Initiative

                                Map Animation

   This activity provides information to the U.S. DOE Office of Fossil
   Energy that can be used to help develop a portfolio of program
   (sub)elements for the Advanced Research Program.

   The Advanced Research and Technology Development Program serves as a
   bridge between basic and applied research to support the development
   and deployment of innovative technologies, capable of improving the
   efficient and environmentally responsible supply and utilization of
   fossil energy resources. Based on these principles, the panelists
   agreed to the following goal.

Our Goal

     To identify breakthrough and leapfrog technologies or novel and
     breakthrough applications of existing technologies; Integrate
     advanced research into Fossil Energy's mission; Provide a linkage
     for Fossil Energy to advanced research programs in industry,
     government, and universities, both domestically and internationally.

   Setting the Context...
   the Vital Issues Process VIP Icon

   This is a structured set of dialogs among the principal stakeholders
   associated with the topical area of interest.

   Advanced Computational Capabilities...
   the 'Silicon' Computer                [chip_icon.gif]

   Where available, this is a suite of computer modeling tools that can be
   used to provide valuable analytical results germane to the topic.

   Access to World-Class Experts...
   the 'Protein' Computer          [chat_icon.gif]

   The Protein Computer component of the Decision Support System will
   provide a distributed collaborative environment for decision makers,
   analysts, consultants, and interested stakeholders to share
   information, exchange data, and analyze the model results real time.
   Opportunities will include videoconferencing, simultaneous viewing of
   "silicon" computer model results, white board teleconferencing of data
   and ideas, file transfer, as well as chat rooms.
