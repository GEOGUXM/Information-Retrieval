   Federal Computer Security Program Managers' Forum Header image

   Welcome to the Federal Computer Security Program Managers' Forum
   ("Forum") website. The Forum is an informal group sponsored by the
   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to promote the
   sharing of computer security information among federal agencies. The
   Forum hosts the Federal Agency Security Practices web site, maintains
   an extensive e-mail list, and holds bi-monthly meetings to discusses
   current issues and developments of interest to those responsible for
   protecting sensitive (unclassified) federal systems [except "Warner
   Amendment" systems, as defined in 44 USC 3502 (2)]. Marianne Swanson of
   NIST serves as the Chairperson. The Forum is assisted by a Steering
   Committee, which helps plan meetings by identifying topics and speakers
   of interest to the members. NIST serves as the secretariat of the
   Forum, providing necessary administrative and logistical support.

OBJECTIVES of the Forum are:

     * to provide an ongoing opportunity for managers of federal computer
       security programs to exchange computer security materials and
       information of use to other programs in a timely manner, build upon
       the experiences of other programs, and reduce possible duplication
       of effort;
     * to provide an organizational mechanism for NIST to exchange
       information directly with federal agency computer security program
       managers in fulfillment of its leadership mandate under the
       Computer Security Act of 1987;
     * to establish and maintain relationships with other individuals or
       organizations that are actively addressing computer security issues
       within the federal government; and
     * to establish and maintain a strong proactive stance identifying and
       resolving strategic and tactical computer security issues involved
       in the development and application of new and emerging information
       technologies.

   FORUM MEMBERSHIP

   New members are always welcomed! Participation in Forum meetings is
   open to federal government employees who participate in the management
   of their organization's computer security program. To join the Forum,
   please provide your name, title, federal agency, mailing address,
   telephone, fax and e-mail to Elaine Frye at NIST (fax 301-926-2733 or
