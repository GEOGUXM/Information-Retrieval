                      Tropical Cyclone Products from DMSP

   Hurricane images are from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program
   (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS). DMSP operates day/night and
   dusk/dawn satellites. Daytime images are taken with sunlight striking
   perpendicular to the storm while dusk/dawn images have sunlight
   glancing across the top of the storm. Images from F12 and F14 are
   daytime images; those from the F13 satellite are dawn/dusk. Each
   hurricane is shown in two separate images showing views in the OLS
   visible near-infrared band and the OLS thermal-infrared band. The
   spatial resolution of the imagery used is 2.7 km. The thermal infrared
   images show the temperatures of the cloud tops, and ocean and land
   surfaces, while the visible-near infrared images show reflected
   sunlight during the day and reflected moonlight or man-made lights
   during the night.

   The Most Intense Tropical Storms of 1998 Poster is 36X24, black and
   white. The 14 most intense tropical storms from the 1996 calendar year
   are shown with thermal infrared imagery from the DMSP Operational
   Linescan System. Although 1998 produced fewer tropical storms than the
   average, the storms were particularly intense. The destructive power of
   these storms was evident in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch. Thousands
   of lives and homes were destroyed by flooding, landslides and wind. The
   roster of most intense tropical storms includes 4 typhoons, 5 cyclones,
   and 5 hurricanes. Each image is accompanied by the vital statistics of
   the storm, including maximum wind speed, date and time of the image,
   latitude and longitude of the eye, and duration of the storm. Order via
   the NNDC Online Store.

   The Most Intense Tropical Storms of 1997 Poster is 36X24, black and
   white. The 14 most intense tropical storms from the 1996 calendar year
   are shown with thermal infrared imagery from the DMSP Operational
   Linescan System. This poster includes images and information for 10
   typhoons, 2 cyclones, and 2 hurricanes. Hurricanes Linda and Guillermo
   were the only western-hemisphere storms to surpass 128 knots average
   wind speed. Super Typhoon Paka lasted a rarely seen duration of twenty
   days. Cyclone Pancho-Helinda travelled nearly the entire width of the
   Indian Ocean. Each image is accompanied by the vital statistics of the
   storm, including maximum wind speed, date and time of the image,
   latitude and longitude of the eye, and duration of the storm. Order via

   most intense tropical storms from the 1996 calendar year are shown with
   thermal infrared imagery from the DMSP Operational Linescan System.
   Each image is accompanied by the vital statistics of the storm,
   including maximum wind speed, date and time of the image, latitude and
   longitude of the eye, and duration of the storm. The roster of most
   intense tropical storms includes 7 typhoons, 5 cyclones, and 2

   The 1995 Atlantic Hurricanes Poster is 24X36, black and white. The 11
   hurricanes from 1995's active season in the Atlantic are shown using
   thermal infrared imagery from the DMSP Operational Linescan System.
   Each image is accompanied by the vital statistics of the storm,
   including maximum wind speed, date and time of the image, latitude and
   longitude of the eye, estimated damage is US dollars, and duration of
   the storm. Order vis the NNDC Online Store.
