    Ultrasound application: finding tumors with improved Doppler imaging

   The white light velocimetry technique demonstrated here in optics can
   be applied to ultrasound. Furthermore, velocimetry can easily be
   combined simultaneously with rangefinding. The use of the same wide
   bandwidth illumination for rangefinding and velocimetry has not been
   done before and promises improved spatial resolution while
   simultaneously sensitively discriminating targets by velocity. This
   could improve the clarity of medical Doppler ultrsound images,
   particular when trying to indentify fine blood vessels associated with
   tumors.

   In conventional ultrasound, wide bandwidth illumination is not used to
   perform Doppler measurement-- long coherence length monochromatic
   illumination is used instead. This means that although the presence of
   moving blood can be detected, the position of the blood vessels having
   that particular velocity cannot be determined with fine spatial
   resolution.

   In our new WLV technique, the illumination is passed through a
   preparatory interferometer which imprints an echo. This creates partial
   coherence at a particular delay value. After reflecting from a target,
   the signal is passed through a detecting interferometer having the same
   delay as the preparatory interferometer. Changes in target velocity
   cause fringe shifts in the time integrated signal outputted from the
   detecting interferometer. Hence, the velocity can be measured even when
   the illumination has a bandwidth many times exceeding the Doppler
   shift. Cross-correlation provides range information. Hence both range
   and velocity can be measured to high quasi-high precision. (Because
   essentially a pair of pulses are used, the uncertainty principle is not
   violated because a new large range ambiguity is created.)

   The fundamental basis for this technique has recently been demonstrated
   in ultrasound at LLNL by Dave Chambers, in a 1999 LDRD funded
   feasibility study. They used a wideband ultrasound test facility
   existing in B343.
