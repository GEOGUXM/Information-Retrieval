   Administration In 1999, 2,472 motorcyclists were killed and an
   additional 50,000 were injured in traffic crashes in the United States
   - 8 percent more than the 2,294 motorcyclist fatalities and 2 percent
   more than the 49,000 motorcyclist injuries reported in 1998. More than
   100,000 motorcyclists have died in traffic crashes since the enactment
   of the Highway Safety and National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act

   3.5 times the fatality rate for passenger car occupants. The injury
   rate for passenger car occupants per registered vehicle was 1.4 times
   the injury rate for motorcyclists. In 1999, motorcyclists accounted for
   6 percent of total traffic fatalities, 7 percent of all occupant
   fatalities, and 2 percent of all occupants injured. More than one-half
   (1,319) of all motorcycles involved in fatal crashes in 1999 collided
   with another motor vehicle in transport. In two-vehicle crashes, 76
   percent of the motorcycles involved were impacted in the front. Only 3
   percent were struck in the rear. Motorcycles are more likely to be
   involved in a fatal collision with a fixed object than are other
   vehicles. In 1999, 27 percent of the motorcycles involved in fatal
   crashes collided with a fixed object, compared to 17 percent for
   passenger cars, 11 percent for light trucks, and 3 percent for large
   trucks. Motorcycles are also more likely to be involved in an injury
   collision with a fixed object than are other vehicles. In 1999, 14
   percent of the reported injury crashes involving motorcycles were fixed
   object crashes, compared to 8 percent for passenger cars, 7 percent for
   light trucks, and 3 percent for large trucks. In 1999, there were 1,122
   two-vehicle fatal crashes involving a motorcycle and another vehicle.
   In 38 percent (425) of these crashes the other vehicle was turning left
   while the motorcycle was going straight, passing, or overtaking the
   vehicle. Both vehicles were going straight in 262 crashes (23 percent).

   fatalities in 1999 resulted from crashes in seven states: 236 in
   California, 182 in Texas, 177 in Florida, 120 in Ohio, 111 in
   Pennsylvania, 107 in New York, and 106 in North Carolina. In 1999, 41
   percent of all motorcyclists involved in fatal crashes were speeding,
   approximately twice the rate for drivers of passenger cars or light
   trucks. The percentage of alcohol involvement was more than 50 percent
   higher for motorcyclists than for drivers of passenger vehicles.
   Licensing Nearly one out of six motorcycle operators (15 percent)
   involved in fatal crashes in 1999 were operating the vehicle with an
   invalid license at the time of the collision, while only 11 percent of
   drivers of passenger vehicles in fatal crashes did not have a valid
   license. Motorcycle operators involved in fatal traffic crashes were
   more than 1.5 times as likely as passenger vehicle drivers to have a
   previous license "Nearly one out of six suspension or revocation (20

   Alcohol Motorcycle operators involved in fatal crashes in 1999 had
   higher intoxication rates, with blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) of
   0.10 grams per deciliter (g/dl) or greater, than any other type of
   motor vehicle driver. Intoxication rates for vehicle operators involved
   in fatal crashes were 28 percent for motorcycles, 20 percent for light
   trucks, 17 percent for passenger cars, and 1 percent for large trucks.
   In 1999, 28 percent of all fatally injured motorcycle operators were
   intoxicated (BAC 0.10 g/dl or greater). An additional 10 percent had
   lower alcohol levels (BAC 0.01 to 0.09 g/dl). The intoxication rate was
   highest for fatally injured operators between 35 and 39 years old (45
   percent), followed by ages 40 to 44 (39 percent) and ages 30 to 34 (39
   percent). "Almost half of the motorcycle Almost half (42 percent) of
   the 1,045 motorcycle operators who died in operators who died
   single-vehicle crashes in 1999 were intoxicated. Three-fifths (61
   percent) in single-vehicle of those killed in single-vehicle crashes on
   weekend nights were intoxicated. crashes in 1999 were intoxicated."
   Motorcycle operators killed in traffic crashes at night were nearly 4
   times as likely to be intoxicated as those killed during the day (43
   percent and 12 percent, respectively). The reported helmet use rate for
   intoxicated motorcycle operators killed in traffic crashes was 42
   percent, compared with 62 percent for those who were sober. Figure 2.

   Safety Facts 1999 - Motorcycles 5 Helmets NHTSA estimates that helmets
   saved the lives of 551 motorcyclists in 1999. If all motorcyclists had
   worn helmets, an additional 326 lives could have been saved. Helmets
   are estimated to be 29 percent effective in preventing fatal injuries
   to motorcyclists. Helmets cannot protect the rider from most types of
   bodily injuries. However, a recent NHTSA study showed that motorcycle
   helmets are 67 percent effective in preventing brain injuries. (Source:
   1996 Crash Outcome Data Evaluation System (CODES): Report to Congress
   on Benefits of Safety Belts and Motorcycle Helmets.) According to
   NHTSA's National Occupant Protection Use Survey, a nationally
   representative observational survey of motorcycle helmet, safety belt,
   and child safety seat use, helmet use was 67 percent in 1998. According
   to previous NHTSA surveys, helmet use was reported to be "Helmets are
   essentially 100 percent at sites with helmet use laws governing all
   estimated to be motorcycle riders, as compared to 34 to 54 percent at
   sites with no helmet 29 percent effective use laws or laws limited to
   minors. in preventing Reported helmet use rates for fatally injured
   motorcyclists in 1999 were fatal injuries 55 percent for operators and
   47 percent for passengers, compared with to motorcyclists." 54 percent
   and 45 percent, respectively, in 1998. All motorcycle helmets sold in
   the United States are required to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety
   Standard 218, the performance standard which establishes the minimum
   level of protection helmets must afford each user. In 1999, 21 states,
   the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico required helmet use by all
   motorcycle operators and passengers. In another 26 states, only persons
   under a specific age, usually 18, were required to wear helmets. Three
   states had no laws requiring helmet use. NHTSA estimates that $13.2
   billion was saved from 1984 through 1999 because of the use of
   motorcycle helmets. An additional $11.1 billion would have been saved
   if all motorcyclists had worn helmets. For more information:
