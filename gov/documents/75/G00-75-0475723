                              Program Overview

   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-33) established the
   Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program (RHFP). The BBA '97
   established designation of a  Critical Access Hospital (CAH) This law
   also made a grant available to the State to designate CAH's. See
   the Technical Assistance and Service Center (TASC) web site for more
   information about available assistance and criteria for eligibility.

   A new report from the Lewin Group, "Impact of the Balanced Budget Act
   of 1997 and the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 on Rural
   Hospitals" is available on the web at:
   http://ruralhealth.hrsa.gov/pubs.htm
   It is made up of a PowerPoint presentation and tables.

   Besides designation of Critical Access Hospitals, the RHFP addresses
   four major goals, which are listed below. The Rural Hospital
   Flexibility Project Steering Committee provides direction to meet the
   goals.
    1. Creation and improvement of a Rural State Health Plan,
    2. Development and implementation of Rural Health Networks to ensure
       continuum of patient care,
    3. Improvement and integration of Emergency Medical Services, and
    4. Ability to address Quality of Care issues.
