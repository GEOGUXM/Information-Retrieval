   30 Doradus is lit up like a Christmas tree. Shining in light across the
   electromagnetic spectrum, 30 Doradus glows because of all the energetic
   processes that go on there. A distinctive region visible in a Milky Way
   satellite galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), 30 Doradus is
   a hotbed of star formation, supernova explosions, and ionized plasma.
   The above image is a composite of three pictures taken in three
   different wavelength bands of light. Red represents X-ray emission
   created by gas as hot as 1 million degrees Kelvin. Green represents
   emission from ionized hydrogen gas, and blue represents ultraviolet
   radiation primarily emitted by hot stars. At the conclusion of this
   symphony of star formation and light in a few million years,
   astronomers expect that a new globular cluster will have formed.
