                The Profitability of Energy Efficiency Upgrades

  Application of these 10 energy efficiency measures in a typical home yields
  nearly $600 in annual bill savings, and an impressive 16% overall return on
  investment. More...

   This diagram provides a representative view of the high profitability
   of energy efficiency upgrades. Note that the home evaluated here is
   located in an average U.S. climate and has a heat pump, electric water
   heater, clothes washer, clothes dryer, and dishwasher.

   The example cost-effectively surpasses the 30% savings target for
   existing homes under PATH (The Partnership for Advancing Technology in
   Housing). In fact, all of these measures yield a higher return on
   investment than an ordinary bank account, and most are as or even more
   profitable than the stock market has been in recent years! The
   efficiency savings shown above include the effect of income taxes. This
   makes the savings even more attractive, because you can keep all the
   money you save on your energy bills, but have to pay hefty taxes on
   most ordinary investment income.

   Energy Efficiency Upgrade Purchase Price^1 Annual Bill Savings^2 Simple
   Payback (yrs) Rate of Return
   Fluorescent Lamps & Fixtures $200 $80 2.5 41%
   Duct sealing $250 $95 2.6 41%
   ENERGY STAR Clothes washer $194 $66 2.9 37%
   ENERGY STAR Programmable Thermostat $107 $29 3.7 30%
   Water Heater Tank Wrap (R-12) $85 $23 3.7 28%
   ENERGY STAR Refrigerator $97 $23 4.2 27%
   ENERGY STAR Heat Pump $692 $126 5.5 19%
   ENERGY STAR Dishwasher $29 $5 5.5 18%
   Air sealing to 0.5 air changes per hour $522 $38 13.7 9%
   Increase wall and attic insulation $1,784 $111 16.1 8%
   Total $3,960 $597 6.6 16%
   Total bill savings as % of baseline bill ^3 36%

   NOTES:
   Assumes typical house with air-source heat pump, electric water
   heating, clotheswasher, clothes dryer, dishwasher. Purchase prices and
   annual bill savings for efficiency measures are in nominal 1997
   dollars. The rate of return assumes 3% annual inflation in residential
   electricity prices. After-tax rates of return assume a 28% marginal
   income tax rate.
   ^1Purchase price of clotheswasher, dishwasher, thermostat, and heat
   pump measures is incremental to the price of existing "NAECA" appliance
   standards. All other prices reflect the full cost of the measure,
   including installation. ^2 Bill savings assume average electricity cost
   of 8.8Â¢ per kilowatt-hour. Bill savings of equipment measures are
   relative to a NAECA standard unit. ^3 Heating and cooling consumption
   values are from LBNL energy modeling using DOE-2; other enduse
   consumptions are from the U.S. Department of Energy's Residential
   Energy Consumption Survey (RECS).
