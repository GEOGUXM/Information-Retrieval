   Fuels

   Compressed Natural Gas Fuel for Vehicles Argonne develops, tests, and
   transfers technology to the nation's transportation system that
   improves energy efficiency, reduces dependence on foreign oil, advances
   the use of alternative fuels, enhances market acceptance for future
   transportation technologies, and increases the participation of small
   businesses and universities. We have experimental laboratories on site
   as well as access to off-site testing facilities.

   Argonne operates state-of-the-art experimental facilities and maintains
   a highly qualified interdisciplinary staff of mechanical and electrical
   engineers, computer modelers, test technicians, and support staff.

Research Areas

     [bullet.gif] Argonne Puts AFVs to the Test: With 60 vehicles,
     Argonne's Center for Transportation Research is the nation's largest
     alternative-fuel fleet demonstration center and the only one with
     all models of OEM-produced vehicles.
     * Alternative Motor Fuels Act (AMFA) Program
     * On-Site Fueling at Argonne
     * Fleet Statistics

     [bullet.gif] CNG Refueling Infrastructure. Argonne is focusing on
     reducing the initial and operating costs of CNG refueling
     facilities, including our own on-site station.

     [bullet.gif] Design Competitions for Students Advanced Vehicle
     Technology Competitions. The vehicle competition program is a unique
     coalition of government and industry, aimed at eliminating technical
     and institutional barriers to acceptance and production of advanced
     vehicle propulsion systems and alternative fuels.
