                      Meteorological Network Operations

   Installation of 15-m meteorological tower at Big Southern Butte. FRD
   and its predecessors have observed and recorded meteorological
   conditions at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental
   Laboratory (INEEL) since 1948. In 1990, the INEEL Meteorological
   Measuring Network began a major transition to the current 31-station
   configuration. The network is based on modern computer and
   communication technology. The technology includes new hardware and
   application software, 15-m meteorological towers and instruments, radio
   telemetry, and a 915-MHz radar wind profiler and radio acoustic
   sounding system (RASS). The network provides the high quality data and
   information necessary to meet a wide range of regulatory requirements.
   The data are used, for example, to:
     * Calculate radiation doses from INEEL operations for the Annual Site
       Environmental Report;
     * Calculate radiation doses required by the National Emission
       Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS);
     * Determine liquid precipitation or water content exceeding several
       critical values that are necessary for maintaining compliance with
       the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Program;
     * Calculate historical doses for Environmental Assessments and
       Environmental Impact Statements.

   The network, plus larger scale synoptic data, allows the Division to
   issue twice-daily site forecasts and advisories (as needed) for special
   and routine INEEL operations.
