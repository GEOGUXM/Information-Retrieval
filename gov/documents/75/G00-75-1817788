   Cutover to VPN

   As of July 30, 2001 at 11:40 AM, the cutover of the ECT dial-in systems
   was completed. The functionalities of these dial-in systems is
   described as follows:

   Dial-in System #1 "TS5"

   TS5 is the production dial-up system which provides analog modem
   connectivity from the Focal local dial-up access numbers as well as the
   MCI Nationwide 800 service and the Ameritech International Access
   number.
     * Ameritech International (1-xxx-xxx-2050)
     * Focal Local Dialup (xxx-xxx-7755)
     * MCI 1-800 service (1-800-xxx-xxxx)

   Anyone with a valid ECT remote access account can use these numbers.
   After MS dialup networking authentication, (or other dialup
   authentication via PAP) users are connected to the green network and
   the Internet. If the user has no other way to get through the firewall,
   they may use the Cisco VPN client (only the MS version available to
   date). The DOE warning banner will be received when running the Cisco
   client.

   Please see www.ect.anl.gov/networking/vpn.htm for more information on
   installing and configuring the Cisco VPN client software. This software
   is not only used for analog modem dial-up, but it can also be used by
   remote users who connect to the Laboratory via the internet.

   Updated white papers for Windows 95/98 and a new paper for Windows 2000
   configuration of dial-up networking are available to help with setup.

   Dial-in System #2 "TS6"

   A second dial-in system (TS6) is installed to accommodate Unix, Solaris
   and Mac users because a Cisco VPN client (that supports these systems)
   is not yet available. These users will need to contact Mike Monczynski
   III at mikemjr@anl.gov or Ext. 2-4181 to obtain an access number. This
   access number is a temporary access number until the Cisco VPN client
   software becomes available. Again, if you have another method of access
   through the firewall, then you may use the dial-up numbers offered by
   "TS5".

   There will be two access numbers associated with Dial-in System #2
   (TS6)
     * Ameritech international, long distance or local access (New)
     * Focal Local Dial-up (New/Coming)

   The functionalities of these two access numbers is decribed below:

   Ameritech Access Number

   Regular telephone company charges will accumulate on your phone bill
   for calls placed to the Ameritech access number. Calls can be placed to
   this Ameritech number either locally, as long distance, or
   internationally (depending on where you are calling from). Charges
   apply based upon distance, time of day, and duration of the call. Do
   not assume that your call will be charged as a "local" call. Use this
   access number as required, but extinguish calls as soon as possible.

   Focal Local Access (Coming)

   In a week or two, Unix, Solaris and Mac users will need to change their
   access phone number (from the Ameritech number) a second time if they
   wish to have a local access number. Mike Monczynski III will announce
   when the Focal dial-up numbers are available. After the Focal numbers
   are in place, they will provide the local dial-in capability similar to
   that of the Focal Local service on TS5.
   Thank you for your patience during these system changes.
