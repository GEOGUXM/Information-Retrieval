                     SEER Summary Staging Manual - 2000

   This version of the SEER Summary Staging Manual - 2000 posted June 18,
   2001 is the final version which will be printed. It reflects mainly
   formatting changes from the previous document that was posted in March
   2001. There is an errata sheet posted below which lists the changes
   made between the two versions. The June 18, 2001 version should be used
   for all cases diagnosed January 1, 2001 and later, and should be used
   for all future training sessions involving the implementation of SEER
   Summary Stage - 2000.
   NAACCR has guidelines concerning the SEER Summary Staging Manual -
   2000.
   The printed version of the Summary Staging Manual - 2000 will be
   available after July 1, 2001. It will be distributed to hospitals
   shortly thereafter through state and SEER central registries
   participating in the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) or
   the SEER Program. Online ordering along with the other SEER hardcopy
   publications will become available after the above mentioned mechanisms
   take place.
