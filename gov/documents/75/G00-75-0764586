Mission

   Southwestern Power Administrationâ€™s mission is to market and reliably
   deliver Federal hydroelectric power with preference to public bodies
   and cooperatives. This will be accomplished by maximizing the use of
   Federal assets to repay the Federal investment while balancing power
   needs with the diverse interests of other water resource users, and
   implementing public policy.

Vision

   Southwestern has an open and trusting partnership with its customers in
   meeting their business expectations for operation of the Federal
   hydropower system and with the American public in meeting its financial
   obligations while providing good stewardship of regional water
   resources.  The Southwestern work force is cost-conscious, team-based
   and empowered to meet customer expectations.
