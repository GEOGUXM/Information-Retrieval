      The Allen County Cadet Squadron was chartered October, 1973 as #12186 in
      Fort Wayne, IN. It grew out of the former
      Smith Field cadet squadron, which in turn developed in 1965 from the
      former Fort Wayne Composite Squadron. The
      first commander was Robert Kennedy, followed by Richard Beckman, Fred
      Latchaw, Sam Conte, Gary Bard and
      currently Richard Farlee.

   According to available squadron records, plaques and trophies, the
   following is a short history of the squadron. We do not,
   however, have complete records. The following is what is accountable:

   1973 to 1979-Winners of the Indiana Wing Cadet Competition at least 3
   times.
                        -Participated in GLR Region Cadet Competition
   twice.

   to the USAF Academy, also our first!
   1979-Squadron ranks decimated by poor quarters and uncertainty of
   having them for the future. Active membership sinks
             to 4 seniors and 4 cadets.
   1980-Squadron is forced out of Northern Skyways hangar quarters, but
   warmly received by the 122TFW, Indiana Air
             National Guard. Squadron immediately rebuilds under the
   leadership of LTC Latchaw.

             working logistics. Field trips are initiated to "fill out"
   classroom study. Cadets are motivated to test on a regular schedule
             as the Contes' organize a formal testing requirement and
   program.
