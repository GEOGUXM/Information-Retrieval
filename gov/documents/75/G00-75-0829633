   General Information

      Hands-On Universe ® (HOU) is an educational program that enables
      students to investigate the Universe while applying tools and concepts
      from science, math, and technology. Using the Internet, HOU
      participants around the world request observations from an automated
      telescope, download images from a large image archive, and analyze them
      with the aid of user-friendly image processing software. The Lawrence
      Hall of Science at University of California, Berkeley, is the
      educational center for the HOU project.
