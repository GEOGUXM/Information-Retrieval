                             Summit Information

   The Technical Education / Workforce Development Summits are designed in
   response to Mayor John Street's goal to propel Philadelphia into the
   ranks of top 10 cities in the country with a reputatation of being able
   to satisfy current and future workforce needs in an economy driven by
   technology.

   The goals of the TPAC Winter Summit, "eWorkforce: Are We Ready?" are
   to:
     * address issues related to the dynamic changes in industry and
       technical workforce requirements;
     * identify what needs to be done to ensure a first class workforce to
       attract and retain businesses and promote growth in the city and
       region;
     * provide an overview of the progress and achievements of local
       technical development initiatives designed to prepare and retain
       skilled workers, and
     * develop response strategies to meet identified needs.

      A Summary of Proceedings from the TPAC Spring Summit 2001 will be
      available at the Winter Summit, along with the first draft of the
   Technical Education Resource Guide developed from information provided
     at that Summit. The Resource Guide will be updated periodically to
   provide a resource for those seeking to improve their technical skills.
    If you wish to have your technical education offerings incorporated,
                   please complete the appropriate forms.
