   MEMORANDUM FOR HUMAN RESOURCES DIRECTORS (CPM 2001-15)

   FROM:

           DONALD J. WINSTEAD
           ACTING ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR
                 FOR WORKFORCE COMPENSATION AND PERFORMANCE

   SUBJECT:

           January 2002 Pay Adjustments

   On December 28, 2001, the President signed an Executive order to
   implement the January 2002 pay adjustments.  (See Text or PDF version
   of Attachment 1)  Section 646 of the Treasury and General Government
   Appropriations Act, 2002 (Public Law 107-67, November 12, 2001),
   authorized a 4.6 percent overall average pay increase for General
   Schedule employees.  This memorandum reviews relevant portions of the
   Executive order and provides general information on the 2002 pay
   adjustments for the General Schedule and certain other pay systems and
   schedules.

2002 Salary Tables and Effective Date

   We have posted the 2002 salary tables discussed in this memorandum on
   the Office of Personnel Management’s Web site at
   http://www.opm.gov/oca/payrates/index.htm.  The 2002 increased rates of
   pay will become effective on the first day of the first applicable pay
   period beginning on or after January 1, 2002.

   The General Schedule and Other Statutory Pay Systems

   The Executive order provides for an across-the-board increase of 3.6
   percent in the rates of basic pay for the statutory pay systems––the
   General Schedule (GS), the Foreign Service Schedule, and certain
   schedules for the Veterans Health Administration of the Department of
   Veterans Affairs.

   The Senior Executive Service and the Executive Schedule

   The Executive order reflects a decision by the President to increase
   the rates of basic pay for members of the Senior Executive Service
   (SES) by 3.6 percent (rounded to the nearest $100) at levels ES-1
   through ES-3 and by 3.4 percent (rounded to the nearest $100) at levels
   ES-4 through ES-6.  The maximum rate of basic pay for SES members is
   limited by law to the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule,
   which will increase to $130,000.  By law (5 U.S.C. 5318), the rates for
   levels I through V of the Executive Schedule (EX-I through EX-V) will
   increase by 3.4 percent (rounded to the nearest $100).

Administrative Law Judges

   Under 5 U.S.C. 5372, the President may adjust the rates of basic pay
   for administrative law judges (ALJs) at the time of a pay increase for
   the statutory pay systems.  The Executive order reflects a decision by
   the President to increase the rates of basic pay for ALJs at levels
   AL-2 and AL-3 by approximately 5.4 percent (rounded to the nearest
   $100).  The rate of basic pay for AL-1 will increase by approximately
   3.4 percent, since that rate is capped at the rate of basic pay for
   level IV of the Executive Schedule.

Administrative Appeals Judges

   Public Law 106-554, December 21, 2000, amended 5 U.S.C. 5372b to
   authorize the heads of Executive agencies to fix the rates of basic pay
   for administrative appeals judge (AAJ) positions at a rate not less
   than the minimum rate of basic pay for level AL-3 ($86,500 in 2002) and
   not more than the maximum rate of basic pay for level AL-3 ($119,700 in
   2002) of the ALJ pay system established under 5 U.S.C. 5372.  On
   December 11, 2001, OPM issued interim regulations (66 FR 63906), to
   link the structure of the AAJ pay system directly to the structure for
   level AL-3 of the ALJ pay system.

   OPM’s regulations establish six rates of basic pay for the AAJ pay
   system—AA-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  These rates correspond to the rates of
   basic pay for AL-3/A, B, C, D, E, and F of the ALJ pay system under 5
   U.S.C. 5372, as shown in the following table:


   AAJ Pay Level

                                ALJ Pay Level

                          Rate of Basic Pay in 2002

                                    AA-1

                                   AL-3/A

                                    $86,500

                                    AA-2

                                   AL-3/B

                                    $93,100

                                    AA-3

                                   AL-3/C

                                    $99,800

                                    AA-4

                                   AL-3/D

                                  $106,500

                                    AA-5

                                   AL-3/E

                                  $113,100

                                    AA-6

                                   AL-3/F

                                  $119,700


   Other Positions Linked to Executive Schedule Pay Levels

   Pay rates for certain other employees are linked to the Executive
   Schedule.  The rates of basic pay for Board of Contract Appeals (BCA)
   members are calculated as a percentage of the rate for level IV of the
   Executive Schedule.  (See 5 U.S.C. 5372a.)   Therefore, BCA rates of
   basic pay will increase by approximately 3.4 percent.

   The maximum rate of basic pay for senior-level (SL) and scientific or
   professional (ST) positions will increase by approximately 3.4 percent
   (to $130,000).  The minimum rate of basic pay for SL/ST positions is
   equal to 120 percent of the minimum rate of basic pay for GS-15 and
   thus will increase by 3.6 percent (to $99,096) based on the 3.6 percent
   across-the-board GS basic pay adjustment.  Subject to these minimum and
   maximum rates, pay adjustments for SL/ST employees are determined by
   the employing agency.  (See 5 U.S.C. 5376.

   Locality Payments

   The President’s Executive order establishes the amounts of the 2002
   locality payments for GS employees.  On December 6, 2001, the
   President’s Pay Agent (the Secretary of Labor, the Director of the
   Office of Management and Budget, and the Director of the Office of
   Personnel Management) extended the 2002 locality payments to the same
   Governmentwide and single-agency categories that were authorized to
   receive the 2001 locality payments.  (See the President’s Pay Agent
   memorandum to agency heads.)  The Governmentwide categories include the
   SES, employees in SL/ST positions, ALJs, AAJs, BCA members, the Foreign
   Service, and the Senior Foreign Service.  The maximum locality rate of
   pay for these employees is the rate for level III of the Executive
   Schedule ($138,200 in 2002).  (By law, Executive Schedule officials are
   not authorized to receive locality pay.)

   The locality pay areas for 2002 are unchanged from 2001.  There are 32
   locality pay areas, including the “Rest of U.S.” locality pay area.  We
   have posted the definitions of the 2002 locality pay areas on OPM’s Web
   site at http://www.opm.gov/oca/payrates/index.htm.  With this
   memorandum, we are providing a list of the 2002 locality pay
   percentages for the 32 locality pay areas, as well as the net
   percentage increase in each area (reflecting the combined effect of the
   3.6 percent across-the-board increase and the applicable increase in
   the locality pay percentage rate).  (See Attachment 2.)  Also provided
   is a chart showing an example of how the 2002 locality rate and net
   increase is computed for an employee in the “Rest of U.S.” locality pay
   area.  (See Text or PDF version of Attachment 3.)

   2001 Annual Review of Special Salary Rates

   In a separate memorandum (CPM 2001-16), OPM announced the results of
   the 2001 annual review of existing special salary rates.  Most
   employees covered by an existing special rate schedule will receive a
   3.6 percent pay increase.

   IGA Continued Rates

   Certain employees in the former interim geographic adjustment (IGA)
   areas are entitled to a “continued rate” under 5 CFR part 531, subpart
   G.  These continued rates were established in January 1994, when our
   regulations were revised to discontinue the practice of paying IGAs on
   top of nationwide or worldwide special rates.  At the time of the
   January 2002 general pay increase, an IGA continued rate will be
   increased by the dollar amount of the increase in the employee’s
   underlying GS rate.  (See 5 CFR 531.703.)  Since a continued rate is a
   form of saved pay, it is not affected by other pay actions, such as
   within-grade increases or promotions.

   Law Enforcement Officers

   We have prepared separate locality or geographic salary tables for law
   enforcement officers (LEOs) in each locality pay area.  These tables
   incorporate the statutory worldwide law enforcement special rates for
   grades GS-3 through GS-10 (Special Rate Table No. 491), which are used
   as the basis for computing any locality or other geographic payment.
   While LEOs are entitled to the same locality pay percentages that apply
   to other GS employees, special LEO geographic pay adjustments of 16
   percent continue to apply to LEOs in two metropolitan areas:  New York
   and Boston.  (Note: The locality pay percentage for Los Angeles in 2002
   (16.05 percent) is higher than the special LEO geographic pay
   adjustment of 16 percent.  Therefore, LEOs in the Los Angeles locality
   pay area will receive the higher locality pay percentage (16.05
   percent).  The LEO special geographic adjustment in Los Angeles will
   terminate on the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning
   on or after January 1, 2002.)

   LEOs covered by the SES or SL/ST pay systems generally are entitled to
   the locality rates of pay shown in salary tables 2002-ES (LOC) or
   2002-SL/ST (LOC), respectively.  However, since LEOs covered by these
   pay systems in New York and Boston also are entitled to special pay
   adjustments for LEOs, these rates of pay are provided in salary tables
   2002-ES (LEO) and 2002-SL/ST (LEO).

   Certain law enforcement officers are entitled to a “continued rate”
   under 5 CFR 531.307 (established in January 1994 when our regulations
   were revised to discontinue the practice of paying LEO geographic
   adjustments on top of nationwide or worldwide special rates).  As with
   IGA continued rates, at the time of the January 2002 across-the-board
   pay increase, an LEO continued rate will be increased by the dollar
   amount of the increase in the law enforcement officer’s underlying GS
   rate.  (See 5 CFR 531.307(b).)

   Order for Processing Pay Actions

   The general pay adjustments that take effect on the first day of the
   first pay period beginning in January 2002 must be processed before any
   individual pay action (e.g., a within-grade increase or promotion) that
   takes effect on the same date.  General pay adjustments include
   across-the-board increases under 5 U.S.C. 5303, increases in locality
   payments or other geographic adjustments, special rate increases,
   increases in retained rates, and increases in continued rates under 5
   CFR 531.703 or 531.307.  If multiple individual pay actions become
   effective on the date of the January 2002 pay adjustment, those actions
   must be processed in the order that satisfies the simultaneous action
   rule in 5 CFR 531.203(f).

   Pay Administration

   To assist agencies in administering pay as a result of the 2002 pay
   adjustments for GS employees, we are providing examples of pay
   computations in a variety of situations.  (See Attachment 4.)

   Salary Tables for 2002

   The Government Printing Office will publish the “Salary Tables for
   2002” book in early 2002.  The salary table book will provide the 2002
   salary tables, locality pay tables (including hourly rate tables), and
   detailed information on administering locality rates of pay,
   calculating rates of pay, maximum limitations on pay, and deductions
   for benefits.

   The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 15, Circular E,
   Employer’s Tax Guide (revised January 2002), will show the 2002 wage
   bracket income tax withholding tables for both single and married
   persons who are paid on a biweekly basis.  IRS will mail Publication 15
   to employers, and this publication also should be available at IRS
   offices in December 2001.  (Call 1-800-829-3676 to order copies.)  IRS
   publications may be downloaded from the IRS Internet Web site at
   http://www.irs.gov/forms_pubs/index.html.
