   Opposite Side of Callisto from Valhalla Impact

   The heavily cratered portion of the surface of Jupiters moon Callisto,
   seen in this image recorded by NASA's Galileo spacecraft, resembles
   most of Callisto that's been seen in high resolution. This adds
   evidence to a theory that Callisto may hold an underground ocean.

   The area in the image is the opposite point, or antipode, of Callisto's
   Valhalla impact basin. The antipode of any point on a sphere is the
   opposite point on a line through the center of the sphere. Antipodes of
   major impact sites on some other worlds similar in size to Callisto,
   such as Mercury and Earth's moon, show a grooved and hilly terrain
   attributed to seismic shocks focusing on those points from the distant
   impacts. The antipode of Mecury's Caloris impact site [link to
   PIA-02445] is one example. When Galileo flew near Callisto on May 25,
   2001, scientists sought an image to check the Valhalla antipode for
   similar signs of disruption.

   Computer modeling has suggested that if Callisto had a water layer in
   its interior, that layer would have dispersed the seismic shock waves
   from the ancient Valhalla impact. The absence of grooved and hilly
   terrain at the Valhalla antipode is consistent with that possibility.
   Magnetic-field measurements have previously suggested that Callisto has
   a layer of liquid water deep below its surface.

   This image, taken from a distance of 32,000 kilometers (about 20,000
   miles) shows details at the Valhalla antipode down to a size of about
   330 meters (about 1,250 feet) across. Callisto is the outermost of
   Jupiter's four large moons. Its surface of ice and rock is the most
   heavily cratered of any moon in the solar system.

   The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute
   of Technology in Pasadena, manages the Galileo mission for NASA's
   Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C. Additional information about
   the spacecraft and its discoveries is available on the Galileo home
