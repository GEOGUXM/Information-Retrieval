   "Two mighty agencies in collision. Two antagonist and gigantic forces
   in contact, and producing effects on a scale inconceivably grand!"

   "The atmosphere in all directions was filled with ashes, spray,
   gases... while the burning lava, as it fell into the water, was
   shivered into millions of minute particles, and, being thrown back into
   the air, fell in showers of sand on all the surrounding country. The
   coast was extended into the sea... and a pretty sand-beach and a new
   cape was formed."

                                        T. Coan, minister in Hawai`i, 1841

Explosions and collapsing land endanger people

   Such vivid descriptions and scenes of lava entering the sea along
   Kilauea's shoreline draw millions of people to Hawai`i who are hoping
   to witness for themselves growth of new land and experience the
   remarkable interaction of lava and water. Beautiful and stunning, the
   explosive interaction can be dangerous to visitors who venture too
   close to a lava entry point. Also, the new land created by lava
   entering the sea is unstable. Large areas regularly collapse into the
   sea, usually triggering a series of stronger explosions and sending a
   wave of scalding seawater onshore. Such explosions have hurled hot
   rocks and lava fragments more than 100 m (330 ft) inland!

   Unfortunately, the entry of lava into the ocean is difficult to observe
   from a distance because it's often obscured by an energetic and acidic
   steam plume or by an abrupt cliff above the entry point. This often
   invites visitors to jeopardize their safety by walking right up to and
   over the point where lava enters the ocean. Activity that may appear
   stable and non threatening can actually change without warning, leaving
   no time for escape.

    Lava entering the ocean is often hidden beneath a steam plume, which
    may draw unwary visitors too close to the entry point for safety.

   Why are lava entries so dangerous?

   New land created by lava entering the sea looks like a stable platform
   that extends a few tens to hundreds of meters into the ocean. We refer
   to this new land as a lava delta. But what can't be seen is the loose
   pile of unconsolidated lava fragments underneath that supports the new
   land. This pile of material can easily slide away when the growing
   delta advances over a steep submarine slope. Areas the size of several
   football fields can collapse into the ocean with little or no warning.

   People standing on a growing lava delta during a collapse event can be
   swept into the sea, splashed with scalding water, and hit by flying
   rock debris. Visitors to an active lava delta at Kilauea Volcano are
   advised not to venture onto the new land. Entry points can only be
   viewed safely from behind the former sea cliff and shoreline.

Hazardous activity near active lava deltas

     * Collapse of new land into the sea
     * Explosions at lava entry points
     * Waves send scalding water onto new land
