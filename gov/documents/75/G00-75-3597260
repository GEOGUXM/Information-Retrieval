                                        [vhm_f0102.jpg] From understanding complex medical conditions to
   finding the right person to answer your question, it takes real effort
   to stay on top of your health. But here at VISN 10, we offer several
   resources to help make the task easier:

   Patient Education Resource Centers: Each of our medical centers has a
   Patient Education Resource Center where you can research health topics.
   To learn more about the services available and tips for working with
   your doctor, read "Educate Yourself!" .

   Veterans' Health: Of course, this newsletter is another tool we use to
   keep you up to date on health happenings. For example, diabetes may now
   be service-connected for veterans exposed to Agent Orange or other
   herbicides. See the article on this subject to find out if you qualify.

   VA staff: While your primary care provider is a main source of
   information and support, don't forget about others who may be able to
   help you. For example, pharmacists can answer questions about
   prescription and over-the-counter medications as well as herbal
   supplements. To learn more about alternative therapies for arthritis,
   as well as traditional treatments, click here.

   As always, if you ever have any question, just ask. We are here to
   help.

   Acting Network Director


   Correction:

   In the Benefit Plan that was published with the last issue of Veterans'
   Health, there was an error regarding nursing home services. VA will
   provide nursing home services for eligible veterans who are in need of
   nursing home care and are 70 percent or above service-connected or are
   in need of nursing home care for a service-connected disability (some
   copayments may apply.) We apologize for any confusion this may have
   caused.

   What do you think when someone is in the Veterans' Administration
   hospital? You may have the same preconceived notion I had, and it was
   not a pretty picture. I would like to set the picture straight.

   My dad is a WWII veteran. Because he has many health problems, which
   are now complicated by serious memory loss and the cost of treatment, a
   friend suggested the Cincinnati VA. As his health and memory continued
   to deteriorate, I began to accompany Dad and Mom to his appointments at
   the hospital. I realized very quickly that my dad was receiving
   excellent attention from a professional and caring staff. As his needs
   worsened, Dad was admitted to the VA hospital. The staff has been
   working with my dad now for about two weeks, providing one-on-one care
   for hours at a time. Although Dad is not going to get better, he is
   feeling better.

   Thanks to everyone at the Cincinnati VA--and especially those presently
   taking care of my dad on Seventh South--for making a very difficult
   time for our family a little easier. If your mental picture of our VA
   was like mine, I hope this helps re-draw it.
