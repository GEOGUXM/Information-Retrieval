   L&Is initiative to reduce injuries and level the playing field among
   residential framers



   Residential wood framing is one of the most dangerous occupations in
   construction.  And while a majority of employers attempt to provide a
   safe work environment, and pay their fair share of workers'
   compensation premiums, others try to avoid their legal responsibilities
   at the expense of the state and law-abiding contractors.  To correct
   the inequity, Labor and Industries has launched a program to bring all
   residential wood framers in compliance with the laws on workplace
   safety and workers' compensation insurance.  The goal is to reduce
   injuries to framers and bring premiums, now among the highest in the
   industry, in line with other trades.
