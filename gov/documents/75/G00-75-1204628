   One of the most important changes currently being made by NASA is the
   identification and implementation of defined roles and responsibilities
   for each Field Installation. As part of our ongoing activities to
   reduce overlap and streamline administrative and program functions
   across the Agency, NASA's Senior Management has established areas of
   excellence and specific missions for each NASA Center and Headquarters.

   Each "Center of Excellence," as shown on the right, represents a
   focused Agencywide capability in a recognized area of technical
   competence in which a Center is in a position of preeminence within the
   Agency, if not worldwide.
