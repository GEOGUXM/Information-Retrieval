   The Magnet Science and Technology (MS&T) Division of the NHMFL is a
   national resource with broad responsibility to develop the technology
   for cutting edge magnet systems. This includes building advanced magnet
   systems for the NHMFL site, working with industry to develop the
   technology to improve high field magnet manufacturing capabilities, and
   pushing the state of the art beyond what is currently available in high
   field magnet systems through materials and magnet research. To this
   purpose, MS&T has established leading capabilities in many aspects of
   magnet system engineering.These include several core projects:
     * DC Bitter resistive magnets (currently to 33 T)
     * Hybrid magnets (Bitter + superconducting) to 45 T
     * Capacitively driven pulsed magnets in excess of 70 T
     * NMR spectrometer magnets to 21 T (900 MHz)

   To support the major projects and advance magnet technology, MS&T has
   ongoing R&D programs in several related technologies. These include:
     * High temperature superconductors for magnets
     * High strength, high conductivity materials
     * Cryogenics
     * Current leads based on high temperature superconductors
     * Coated conductor development

   In addition, MS&T cooperates with industry and other laboratories on a
   variety of magnet technology projects. These projects, called work for
   others, cover the range of analysis, design, materials, component
   development and testing, coil fabrication, cryogenics, system
   integration and testing.

   The activities of MS&T are supported by magnet development facilities
   established and maintained within the NHMFL. These include a variety of
   coil fabrication areas, test and analysis laboratories, and material
   development facilities.

   For those interested in educational opportunities in Magnet Science and
   Technology, a number of options are available through our affiliated
   universities. MS&T supports a variety of graduate student research
   projects and participates in numerous student exchanges.

   This Web site is under development. Current MS&T personnel and
   publication information is available now and new information about
   projects, programs, facilities, and educational opportunities is coming
   soon. For further information or assistance, contact MS&T at
   850-644-0566.
