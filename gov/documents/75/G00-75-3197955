   on a monthly basis. The S and I Funds were implemented in May 2001, so
   the twelve-month returns reflect the performance of the S and I Funds
   for May 2001 and the related Barclay's funds in which they are invested
   for the previous 11 months.  Percentages in ( ) are negative.

   and accrued investment management fees.
