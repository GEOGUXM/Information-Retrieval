      [bluearrow.gif]   If I don't use an attorney how do I file process?

       Pro Se (which means you are filing for yourself).

      [bluearrow.gif]   How do I file pro se?

      1.    Go to the clerk' office. Pick up blank summons or warrant.

      2.    Ask if they provide information forms. If none are available ask
      for guidance in filling in the process.

      3.    Be sure all the information on the defendant is correct. Furnish
      home and work addresses.

      4.    When your summons or warrant is filled out present it to the
      clerk with the appropriate fee so that it can be issued.

      5.    Once your process is issued it will be forwarded to the sheriff's
      civil process section for service.

      [bluearrow.gif]   Note:

      If you are comfortable filing process for yourself and feel confident
      that you can present your case in court then you certainly can. If you
      require legal assistance we suggest that you seek counsel to represent
      you.

      The clerk of the court, nor the sheriff, can answer legal questions or
      give legal advice.
