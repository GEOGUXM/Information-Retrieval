     Important Note: Now that the CAT projects have developed their own
   Internet expertise and familiarity with available resources, RSPAC will
   no longer be adding to or updating these resource lists. We will leave
      the existing material intact at this location. If you are having
   problems locating something specific, please contact us and we will do
                           our best to assist you.
