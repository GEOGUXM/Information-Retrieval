     More Than $7.6 Million in Disaster Aid Delivered in Mississippi

                   For Complete Coverage of this Disaster

    Jackson, M.S., January 24, 2002 -- With the February 5th application
    deadline for federal and state disaster assistance approaching, total
    aid delivered to residents and businesses in the 17 disaster-stricken
        Mississippi counties reached $7,676,773, today. So far, 1,855
   applications have been received from individuals, families and business
   owners who sustained disaster losses resulting from the severe storms,
    tornadoes and flooding that occurred between November 24 and December
                                  17, 2001.

       The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) has approved
   Individual and Family Grant checks to 450 families totaling $1,288,999,
   while $1,267,374 in disaster housing assistance checks was sent to 936
   families. The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has approved 96
   low interest disaster recovery loans for a total of $5,120,400, so far.

    Gracia Szczech, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's official in
   charge of the recovery effort, said, "If you suffered damage resulting
    from the recent severe weather and have not registered for assistance
    yet, time is running out. There are less than two weeks left to apply
                for assistance. The deadline is February 5."

    The FEMA toll-free registration number is 1-800-621-3362. The number
        for the hearing or speech impaired to call is 1-800-462-7585.

   Leon Shaifer, Mississippi's coordinating officer for disaster recovery,
   added, "With less than two weeks left to apply for disaster assistance,
   we urge everyone who sustained damage during the recent severe weather
   to make that one toll-free phone call. That's all that is necessary to
   register for disaster assistance. You make one call to FEMA and provide
    some basic information. Typically, it takes about 15 to 20 minutes."

   Applications received so far by county are: Bolivar, 152; Coahoma, 52;
      DeSoto, 144; Grenada, 6; Hinds, 5; Humphreys, 206; Lafayette, 16;
