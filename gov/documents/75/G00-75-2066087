                  Goals of the Supersymmetry/Higgs Workshop

     * Organize and improve our understanding of all possible variants of
       weak scale supersymmetry which may manifest themselves in collider
       experiments at Tevatron Run II. This includes identifying the most
       useful parametrizations of the minimal and near-minimal scenarios.
     * Improve our ability to perform realistic simulations of all the
       interesting SUSY variants, as well as the relevant standard model
       backgrounds. This includes improved calculations of SUSY production
       mechanisms at the Tevatron, and upgrades of the existing event
       generators.
     * Identify and organize the multichannel experimental signatures of
       each SUSY variant, explore novel signatures, devise improved
       strategies for combining information from multiple channels, and
       stimulate creative ideas for extending the reach of the Run II
       experiments.
     * Improve our ability to translate the observation/nonobservation of
       SUSY signals in multiple channels into meaningful constraints on,
       and tests of, the theoretical assumptions underlying weak scale
       SUSY scenarios.
     * Explore the theoretical upper bounds on the mass of the lightest
       Higgs in weak scale supersymmetry, given a variety of both strong
       and weak theoretical assumptions. Improve our understanding of
       multichannel Higgs searches at the Tevatron, and refine the reach
       estimates for integrated luminosities in the range 2-30 fb-1.
