Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

   November 7, 2001

   Dear Neighbor:

   As you know, security is being heightened across the nation. At the
   Laboratory we have taken steps to improve our security, as a result of
   the events of September 11, to increase the protection of federal
   facilities and the people who work at them. Most of these have been
   designed to have as little effect as possible on adjoining streets or
   neighborhoods.

   Recently, Laboratory security was increased by the addition of random
   flights along our perimeter by helicopters and airplanes from county
   and regional law enforcement agencies. These flights are part of the
   state's upgrade in security for local, county, state and federal
   facilities.

   You will see these helicopters and airplanes flying around our
   perimeter at about 500 feet above the ground. The aircraft markings
   should show the agency providing the security over-flight. The flights
   may take place at various times during the day and night.

   There shouldn't be any problems with the additional noise, but I wanted
   to make sure you were informed of the flights. Please let me know if
   you have any questions about the flights or any other environmental
   issues relating to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Please call
   424-4026 or e-mail heffner1@llnl.gov .

   Sincerely,

   H.F. Heffner, Manager
