             The crew will continue the task of building and enhancing the
             International Space Station by delivering the U.S. laboratory
             module. The Shuttle will spend six days docked to the station
             while the laboratory is attached and three spacewalks are
             conducted to complete its assembly. The STS-98 mission will
             occur while the first station crew is aboard the new spacecraft.

   Launch:

             February 7, 2001, 6:13 p.m. EST KSC Launch window was 4 minutes,
             48 seconds.
             On Wednesday, February 7, 2001, Loading of the external tank was
             scheduled to begin at 9:16 a.m. but began early at 8:45 a.m. and
             was in stable replenish mode by 12:30 p.m. Forecasters initially
             indicated a 10 percent chance of KSC weather violating launch
             commit criteria on Wednesday but upgraded that to a 100 percent
             chance of favorable weather. The only issues worked during the
             countdown were concerns over weather at the TAL sites in Spain
             and Morocco. At 2:30 p.m, the crew left the O&C building and
             proceeded to Pad 39-A. By shortly after 4:00pm, the crew hatch
             was closed and locked for flight. At 5:49 p.m. the launch team
             discussed concerns about an irregular voltage measurement on one
             of Atlantis's MDM's but decided it was a sensor issue. Launch
             occured 2 minutes after the planned liftoff time.

             On Tuesday, February 6, 2001, the KSC launch team proceed on
             schedule with STS-98 launch preparations. Monday night, workers
             loaded cryogenic reactants into Space Shuttle Atlantis' onboard
             storage tanks and Shuttle pyrotechnic tests concluded that
             afternoon. At the launch pad, the orbiter's midbody umbilical
             unit was demated and the sound suppression system water tank was
             filled. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 2/06/2001)

             On Sunday, February 5, 2001 the flight crew arrived at KSC at
             1:43 p.m EST and the countdown clock began at 10 p.m EST (03:00
             GMT) at the T-minus 43 hour mark. Sunday morning, workers
             replaced one of the three space suits aboard Atlantis.

             On Friday, 1/26/2001, Space Shuttle Atlantis rolled out of the
             Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at 6:48 a.m. and arrived at
             Launch Pad 39A at 12:44 p.m. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             1/26/2001)

             On Thursday, 1/25/2001, Shuttle managers today announced Feb. 7
             as the target launch date for Space Shuttle Atlantis on mission
             STS-98. The previous launch date was 2/6/2001 at 6:37 p.m. The
             new date accommodates scheduled launch activities on the Eastern
             Range and better supports a desire to rendezvous with the
             orbiting International Space Station on flight day 3. (Reference
             KSC Shuttle Status 1/25/2001)

             On Monday, 1/22/2001, Over the weekend, technicians successfully
             completed continuity "wiggle" tests on the systems tunnel cables
             located in both STS-98 solid rocket boosters. Workers began
             collecting X-ray images of the cables Sunday and concluded that
             effort at 2:30 a.m. today. Analysis of the X-ray images
             confirmed that the cables have no physical damage. (Reference
             KSC Shuttle Status 1/22/2001)
             On Monday, 1/15/2001, After additional testing and analysis of
             Solid Rocket Booster cables throughout the Shuttle fleet,
             Shuttle Program officials decided late today to return Atlantis
             to the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center.to
             conduct further inspections. Because of the uncertainty
             involving the integrity of the SRB cables, Shuttle Program
             Manager Ron Dittemore ordered Atlantis to be rolled back to the
             Vehicle Assembly Building later this week for more inspections.
             The rollback is scheduled to take place Friday.

             The rollback was ordered prior to the planned start of the
             countdown early Tuesday for Atlantis' scheduled launch January
             19 to deliver the U.S. Laboratory Destiny to the International
             Space Station. The launch will be delayed until no earlier than
             February 6. Atlantis' five astronauts were informed of the
             rollback decision prior to their departure from Ellington Field
             in Houston for KSC. They will come out of quarantine to resume
             training for their mission.

             As a result of the rollback decision, Destiny will be removed
             from Atlantis' payload bay Thursday and will remain in the
             payload change out room at Launch Pad 39-A. Pending the results
             of the cable inspections, which will begin this weekend,
             Atlantis could return to the launch pad around January 25 to
             resume pre-launch preparations. Atlantis' launch delay will have
             some impact on the scheduled March 1 launch of Discovery on the
             STS-102 / 5A.1 mission to the International Space Station.
             Shuttle program officials will be assessing the potential launch
             impact over the next few weeks.

             (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 1/15/2001)

             On Tuesday, 1/2/2001, the Space Shuttle Atlantis began its move
             to Launch Pad 39A at about 8:30 a.m., but an hour later stopped
             on the crawler path so engineers could troubleshoot a failed
             computer processor on th crawler transporter. Troubleshooting
             efforts were unsuccessful, so managers decided to roll Atlantis
             back into VAB high bay 3 using a secondary computer processor.
             Managers plan to use KSC ' crawler transporter No. 2 tomorrow
             instead of the trouble crawler transporter No. 1. First motion
             to the launch pad is now expected between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.
             Wednesday. Managers are assessing the impact of this unexpected
             delay on the remainder of the processing schedule. (Reference
             KSC Shuttle Status 1/02/2001)

             Prior to the holidays, Shuttle managers completed an extensive
             evaluation of the STS-98 solid rocket booster ordnance cables
             and determined that they are ready for flight. After thorough
             inspection, X-ray analysis and functional testing, engineers
             identified minor damage to an outer layer of woven metal
             shielding on a cable associated with the left-hand booster's
             lower attachment strut. The damaged area was repaired and
             retested. Subsequent analysis confirmed the cable's flight
             readiness. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 1/02/2001)

             Landing opportunities on February 18 and February 19, 2001 were
             waived off due to weather concerns. The two KSC Landing
             opportunities for February 20, 2001 were also waived off. The
             shuttle landed on the 1st landing opportunity for Edwards Air
             Force Base in California.

             There were two landing opportunities at the Kennedy Space
             Center.on Tuesday, February 20 with the first opportunity
             calling for the firing of Atlantis' braking rockets on orbit 200
             at 10:20 a.m. Central time, resulting in a landing at the Cape
             at 11:27 a.m. Central time. The second opportunity would have
             begun with the deorbit burn maneuver on orbit 201 at 11:56 a.m.
             Central time and a landing at the Kennedy Space Center at 1:02
             p.m. Central time. Both were waived off due to weather concerns.

             Two landing opportunities also are available on the next two
             orbits at Edwards. The first of the Edwards' opportunities would
             call for the deorbit burn at 1:27 p.m. Central time and a
             landing at 2:33 p.m. Central time. The final opportunity of the
             day on Tuesday for Edwards would involve a deorbit burn at 3:04
             p.m. Central time and a landing at 4:09 p.m. Central time. The
             weather at Edwards is also expected to be better, with a chance
             of broken cloud decks and lighter winds than were observed
             today. Landing support will also be called up for the White
             Sands Space Harbor at Northrup Strip in New Mexico, which has
             three landing opportunities available, although all efforts will
             be made to try to bring Atlantis home in either Florida or
             California.
