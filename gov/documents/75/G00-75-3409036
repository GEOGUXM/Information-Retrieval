      The Office of Tourism Industries (TI) has just released its first
      quarter data on arrivals to the United States for the first quarter of
      Year 2001 and is pleased to announce a trade surplus of $3.1 billion,
      receiving $22.3 billion in travel expenditures. The first quarter of
      Year 2001 held steady compared to the same quarter last year with total
      international visitor arrivals at almost 9.5 million. More
      specifically, travelers coming to the U.S. on business visas were up
      for almost every region and several countries. This increase helped
      offset the decline in pleasure travelers who are most affected by
      downturns in the global economy. The increase in business travel also
      contributed to the trade surplus as business travelers spend on average
      more per trip than leisure travelers.

      Overseas travel also remained steady with 5.5 million visitors arriving
      in the first quarter of 2001 with expenditures of $18.5 million.
      Western European arrivals declined 5 percent this quarter, totaling
      almost 2.2 million visitors. Most of the decline was in pleasure travel
      (7 percent) while business visas were up 2 percent. Spending by Western
      European visitors totaled $6.8 billion for the first quarter 2001, down
      6 percent from first quarter last year. Arrivals from the Pacific
      region grew faster (4 percent) this quarter as compared to the same
      quarter last year. South American arrivals were also up slightly, 3
      percent, compared to the same period last year. Both pleasure and
      business travel from Asia and South America were up for this quarter.
      Positive increases in other regions such as Central America (up 5
      percent), Africa (up 4 percent), and the Middle East (up 7 percent)
      also helped the overall stability of the overseas markets.

      With this announcement, TI has released its most in-depth analysis for
      the first quarter of 2001
      http://tinet.ita.doc.gov/tinews/archive/2001_q1.html. TI has also, for
      the first time, combined with DRI-WEFA, an economic consulting firm, to
      offer insights on the economic situation for numerous inbound markets
      in the U.S. We hope the combined information increases the usefulness
      of this analysis for the industry. Arrivals by month for all world
      regions and 19 countries maybe viewed by accessing:
      http://tinet.ita.doc.gov/view/m-2001-I-001/index.html or by subscribing
