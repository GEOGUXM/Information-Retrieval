  Plans for FY97

    Tsunami Project

     * Maintain Tsunami Project network of observational stations.
     * Deploy real-time tsunami deep ocean measurement system in Gulf of
       Alaska.
     * Establish near-real-time system for the collection and archiving of
       Hawaii coastal sea level data.
     * Develop June 10, 1996, field observations database.
     * Implement and test tsunami numerical models for Pacific Disaster
       Center.
     * Convene meeting of Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Federal/State Working
       Group.

    VENTS Program

     * Expand continuous plume monitoring program from north Cleft to
       south Cleft and Axial Volcano on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.
     * Continue on ridge-crest processes and monitoring to determine flow
       changes affecting plume detachment from its source, effects of rift
       walls of circulation and plume dispersion and maintain moorings at
       N/S Cleft and Axial.
     * Build and deploy an array of new instruments to measure seafloor
       spreading, as part of RIDGE Observatory.
     * Analyze and publish results from CoAxial and Gorda Ridge
       expeditions.
     * Continue to develop and use high-performance numerical models to
       look at the effects of hydrothermal discharge on the benthic ocean.
     * Construct and ballast additional RAFOS floats for future volcanic
       event responses.
     * Begin interpretation of FY 96 hydrothermal gas chemistry results in
       collaboration with U.S. and Japanese colleagues.
     * Continue to broaden understanding of the interplay of chemical and
       geological processes with the volcanic and microbiology
       environments.
     * Maintain SOSUS and autonomous hydrophone arrays/analysis.
     * Begin development of real-time data link to autonomous hydrophones.
     * Organize and lead expedition on NOAA Ship Ron Brown to map
       deformation of the Gorda Plate.
