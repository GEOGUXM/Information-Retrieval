   SeaMARC 1A sidescan sonar mosaic, cores and depositional interpretation
   of the Mississippi Fan: ArcView GIS Data Release

   updated 2001-02-22       pages include: Data Sets icon Maps icon
   Publications icon
   An online CDROM contains a SeaMARC 1A sidescan sonar mosaic, cores, and
   a depositional interpretation of the Mississippi Fan, with an ArcView
   GIS Data Release. This study focused on a depositional lobe identified
   in previous GLORIA imagery. A channel and breached levee were studied
   to understand the processes by which sedimentation is redirected to a
   different part of the fan. The channel that originated at the breach in
   the levee of the main channel was traced to the distal edge of the
   Mississippi Fan where deposits associated with the end of this channel
   system were mapped.

   Mapping Turbidite System Pathways on the Lousiana Continental Slope
   with GLORIA and Multibeam Bathymetry

   updated 2000-12-12       pages include: Maps icon Educational Materials
   icon Publications icon
   GLORIA (long-range) sidescan sonar images and multibeam bathymetry show
   turbidite system pathways on the Louisiana Continental Slope, the
   filling of salt withdrawal basins by coarse-grained sediment, and the
   subsequent deformation of these pathways by movement of the underlying
   salt. Two turbidite systems were mapped; one was traced from the
   seaward edge of a Pleistocene-aged delta to the rise, while a second
   was traced across part of the upper slope before it disappeared. Each
   system crossed areas where salt was shallow and places where it was
   deeply buried. Where the pathways cross shallow salt, they are narrow
   (less than 2 km wide), and in places have the appearance of a braided
   stream. Where the salt was deeply buried under salt-withdrawal basins,
   the pathways broadened to fill the basins creating high-backscatter
   areas (coarse-grained deposits?) as large as 18 km in diameter.

   This (online) CD-ROM contains copies of the 250 m resolution GLORIA
   sidescan sonar mosaic for the Gulf of Mexico and its geologic
   interpretation. The imagery and interpretation have been archived here
   to preserve this legacy data set. The data are intended to be GIS-ready
   in as much as the data do not require any additional cleanup,
   formatting, renaming of fields or other "data work" to use the data in
   the GIS of choice.

   nearly one-third of the state population lives within the 14 parishes
   of the Pontchartrain Basin.
