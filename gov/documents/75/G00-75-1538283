   Legal Disclaimers

   If you have trouble understanding the following information, please
   contact the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission
   at (415) 352-3600, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8 am 5
   pm PST. A staff member will assist you. If you cannot call, then write
   or visit the Commission's office at 50 California Street, Suite 2600
   San Francisco, California 94111. We are located at the corner of Davis
   and California streets, one block north of Market and two blocks west
   of the ferry building in the City of San Francisco.

   JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES: It is important to understand that the
   Commission's jurisdiction does not appear on any map. There are no
   official maps showing the Commission's jurisdiction, including the maps
   contained in the San Francisco Bay Plan, or other Commission documents.

   The Commission's jurisdiction is legally delineated by California
   statute and is determined and implemented only by the Commission's
   review of applications, projects, and violations, on a case-by-case
   basis. Therefore, you must contact the Commission in order to determine
   if a project falls within its jurisdiction.

   The Commission also has different kinds of jurisdiction, depending on
   the project, the project sponsors or applicant, and the location of the
   project.

   DEVELOPMENT/PERMIT ISSUES: Please contact the Commission's staff at the
   above address and phone number if you are considering a project
   involving any kind of fill, extraction of materials, development,
   redevelopment, repair, dredging, or change in use in any area subject
   to tidal action in or around San Francisco Bay, South San Francisco
   Bay, San Pablo Bay, Suisun Marsh, and the Carquinez Strait, including
   all tidal sloughs, wetlands, creeks and rivers, marshlands, salt ponds,
   managed wetlands, the shoreline band, and the Priority Use Areas
   described in the Bay Plan.

   Do not rely on any of the information found at this website as a basis
   for action if you are considering a project that may fall under the
   Commission's jurisdiction. Instead, contact the Commission's Staff at
   (415) 352-3600.

   Do not wait until you have begun work to contact the Commission.
   Activities in these areas may require a permit from the Commission, in
   accordance with State law. Violations of State law may result in civil
   and criminal liability.
