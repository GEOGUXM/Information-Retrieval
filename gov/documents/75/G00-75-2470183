     EOS Aura's Instruments, HIRDLS, MLS, OMI, and TES, contain advanced
     technologies that have been developed for use on environmental
     satellites. Each instrument provides unique and complementary
     capabilities that will enable daily global observations of Earth's
     atmospheric ozone layer, air quality, and key climate parameters.
     The table below summarizes the atmospheric parameters measured by
     HIRDLS, MLS, OMI, and TES. The altitude range where these parameters
     are measured are shown as the vertical scale. In several cases the
     measurements overlap which provides independent perspectives and cross
     calibration of the measurements.
