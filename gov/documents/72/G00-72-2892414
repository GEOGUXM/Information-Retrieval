                  HAZARDOUS WEATHER/EMERGENCY ADVISORY PLAN


   1. PURPOSE: This plan establishes guidance for the dismissal, or delays
   in reporting for duty, of Federal employees in the San Antonio area and
   surrounding communities during emergency situations.

   2. SCOPE: This plan applies to all Federal agencies and installations
   in the San Antonio area. NOTIFICATION OF AN EMERGENCY SITUATION
   GENERATED UNDER THIS PLAN IS ADVISORY ONLY. THE FINAL DECISION AS TO
   DISMISSAL OF EMPLOYEES RESTS WITH EACH AGENCY/INSTALLATION HEAD.
   CONSEQUENTLY, EACH AGENCY AND INSTALLATION MUST ESTABLISH ITS OWN
   POLICY AND PROCEDURE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN AND ACTIONS TO BE
   TAKEN UPON NOTIFICATION OF INCLEMENT WEATHER OR AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.

     POLICY
     : All employees are to presume, unless otherwise notified, that
     their office or activity will be open each regular workday
     regardless of inclement weather or other emergency conditions which
     may develop.  Normally, they are expected to be prepared to cope
     with difficult driving conditions and moderate disruptions of public
     transportation facilities.

     EMERGENCY SITUATIONS
     : Emergency situations covered under this plan are defined as those
     of sufficient magnitude to cause serious and hazardous conditions
     that would be dangerous to the health and safety of Federal
     employees. Such situations are confined to those which involve
     Federal agencies and installations as a whole. Emergency situations
     fall into two principal categories, as follows:

   A. Hazardous Weather Conditions. A situation where there is a
   probability of severe weather of sufficient magnitude which could cause
   serious and hazardous conditions that would be dangerous to the health
   and safety of Federal employees.

   B. Other Emergencies. Situations which involve or may involve
   unforeseen events having an adverse impact on Federal government
   operations or presenting a dangerous environment. These situations
   include, but are not limited to, energy shortages, civil disorders,
   riots, fire, transportation strikes, etc. These situations may vary in
   intensity and with the geographic area affected, but generally are of
   sufficient magnitude as to jeopardize the health and safety of Federal
   employees.

   5. PROCEDURES: An FEB "Hotline" will be operational in the FEB Office.
   The phone number will be provided ONLY to the heads of each Federal
   agency and installation. It should be kept confidential and only given
   to those persons within each agency and installation who would have the
   authority, in the absence of the agency or installation head, to
   release employees.

   6. RESPONSIBILITIES:

   A. Hazardous Weather Conditions. The FEB Staff will confer with the
   City of San Antonios [Crisis Management Office et.al.] to determine if
   a hazardous weather condition exists. The FEB Staff will gather
   additional information, as necessary, and advise the FEB Chair of the
   situation. The FEB Chair, based on the advice of the FEB Staff, will
   make a determination as to whether further action is necessary.

   B. Other Emergencies. Any agency official, when, in his/her judgment, a
   situation exists which involves his/her organization alone, but which
   might subsequently involve Federal agencies and installations as a
   whole, will notify the FEB Staff of the situation. The FEB Staff will
   gather additional information, as necessary, and advise the FEB Chair
   of the situation.

   7.   TRIGGERING THE PLAN:

   A. The FEB Executive Director, upon determination that an emergency
   situation exists which warrants consideration of early dismissal, or
   delays in reporting for duty, will confer via phone with the FEB Chair
   and the Emergency Management Officials at Fort Sam Houston and Randolph
   AFB.  PURPOSE IS TO GIVE GUIDANCE TO ALL SAN ANTONIO FEDERAL AGENCIES
   ON THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY VARIOUS LARGE FEDERAL INSTALLATIONS IN THE
   AREA. ACTIONS TAKEN BY THESE UNITS ARE ONLY A GUIDE IN HELPING OTHER
   FEDERAL AGENCIES IN THEIR DECISION PROCESS.

   Following the calls:

   (1) The FEB Chair will inform the FEB Executive Director as to the
   decision reached. If the decision warrants advising early dismissal
   action, or delays in reporting for duty, the FEB Executive Director
   will immediately record the information on the FEB "Hotline," using the
   message in Paragraph 7.B.

   (2) All Federal agency and installation heads can then call the FEBs
   confidential "Hotline" and be guided by the actions taken by other
   federal agencies.
   B. Message will be as follows:  "THIS IS THE FEB HOTLINE. THE FOLLOWING
   ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN DUE TO [state conditions causing activation;
   date]. THIS INFORMATION IS FOR GUIDANCE IN YOUR DECISION-MAKING
   PROCESS. THIS MESSAGE WILL BE UPDATED AS MORE INFORMATION IS RECEIVED."

   C. RADIO and TV STATIONS: The FEB will NOT notify the media of
   recommendations to close. It is the RESPONSIBILITY of each agency and
   installation head to establish his/her own prearranged procedure for
   notifying employees (and the general public, if appropriate) of office
   and installation closures. This procedure may, of course, include media
   announcements by an agency.

   8. UNIFORM AGENCY APPLICATIONS:

   A. Emergency Operations. Agencies and installations participating in
   this plan should designate those persons whose activities must continue
   regardless of emergency situations as "Emergency Employees."

   B. Leave. Agencies and installations participating in this plan should
   follow the guidelines for leave treatment set forth in OPM Memorandum
   for Directors of Personnel (CPM 94-11), subject: "Washington DC Area
   Emergency Dismissal or Closure Procedures." A copy is available on the
   OPM Mainstreet Computer Bulletin Board on (202) 606-4800 (Interagency
   Advisory Group Forum).
