                 Lidar Analysis for Unmanned Ground Vehicles

   The purpose of this work is to evaluate the possible uses of overhead
   Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) systems in the detection of
   obstacles present in the path of an autonomous vehicle.

   A LIDAR system is formed by a laser and sensor mounted on an aircraft,
   a Global Positioning System (GPS), that measures the position of the
   aircraft with respect to a predefined frame of reference, and an
   Inertial Navigation System (INS) unit that determines the orientation
   of the aircraft. Once in the air, the laser is fired, sweeping the
   ground, while the sensor estimates the distance to the ground based on
   the reflections of the laser pulses. This information, together with
   the location and pose of the aircraft at the moment when the pulse was
   generated, is sufficient to estimate the elevation of the terrain
   below.

   The following two sets of images show the results of scanning an area
   with a Lidar system and some of the results of processing these data.
   The first set shows the top and a side views of an area scanned by the
   aircraft while the second set shows the terrain after some of its
   features have been classified. This classification can be used in the
   determination of obstacle-free paths for an unmanned ground vehicle
   (UGV) or any other rover.
