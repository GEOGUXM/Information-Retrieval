   The Office of Legislative and Public Affairs (LPA) serves as the
   Financial Management Services (FMS) liaison with Congress, the public,
   and the news media. With respect to legislative affairs, LPA devises
   and implements the strategy for promoting and enacting FMS legislative
   agenda. The office also prepares testimony and program materials for
   use by FMS executives at Congressional hearings and staff briefings,
   monitors Congressional activity on legislation affecting the FMS
   mission and its operations, and coordinates the preparation of
   responses to Congressional inquiries and reports to Congress.

   The public affairs function of the office includes providing
   information to the public on FMS programs and initiatives by means of
   fact sheets and public awareness campaigns, responding to and
   coordinating the replies to media inquiries, and facilitating the
   responses to requests from the public for documents through the Freedom
   of Information Act and the Privacy Act.
