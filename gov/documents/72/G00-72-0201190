                       Responsibilities and Activities

   The National Mediation Board (NMB), established by the 1934 amendments
   to the Railway Labor Act of 1926, is an independent agency that
   performs a central role in facilitating harmonious labor-management
   relations within two of the nation's key transportation modes--the
   railroads and airlines. Pursuant to the Railway Labor Act, NMB programs
   provide an integrated dispute resolution process to effectively meet
   the statutory objective of minimizing work stoppages in the airline and
   railroad industries. The NMB's integrated processes specifically are
   designed to promote three statutory goals:
     * The prompt and orderly resolution of disputes arising out of the
       negotiation of new or revised collective bargaining agreements;
     * The effectuation of employee rights of self-organization where a
       representation dispute exists; and
     * The prompt and orderly resolution of disputes over the
       interpretation or application of existing agreements.

   Mediation

   The purpose of mediation under the Railway Labor Act is to foster the
   prompt and orderly resolution of collective bargaining disputes in the
   railroad and airline industries. These disputes, referred to as "major"
   disputes, involve the establishment or revision of rates of pay, rules,
   or working conditions. The parties should attempt to resolve collective
   bargaining disputes through direct negotiations. Failing that, either
   party may request the Board's services or the Board may involve itself
   on its own initiative. In its mediatory role, the Board may employ a
   variety of methods, including traditional mediation, interest-based
   problem solving, or facilitation. The Board views the objective of
   mediation as assistance to the parties in achieving agreement and sees
   the role of the mediator as an active participant in the process as a
   key to that assistance.

   NMB expertise in mediation and its discretion to determine when
   mediation has been exhausted, however, ensures that bargaining disputes
   rarely escalate into disruptions of passenger service and the
   transportation of commerce. Historically, some 97 percent of all NMB
   mediation cases have been successfully resolved without interruptions
   to public service. Since 1980, only slightly more than 1 percent of
   cases have involved a disruption of service.

   Presidential Emergency Boards

   In rare situations, when a disruption of essential transportation
   services, which meets the standards specified by the RLA, the NMB may
   recommend that the President create a Presidential Emergency Board. A
   Presidential Emergency Board temporarily prevents a work stoppage or a
   lock out for up to sixty days and provides recommendations for
   resolving the dispute.

   Representation

   Under the Railway Labor Act, the NMB is responsible for effectuating
   employee rights of self-organization where a representation dispute
   exists. The NMB representation process ensures that potentially
   disruptive disputes over who represents employees for collective
   bargaining purposes are resolved peacefully. Peaceful resolution of
   representation disputes is crucial to the airline and railroad
   industries because of the central role they play in the U.S.
   transportation system. The NMB's effective determination of collective
   bargaining representation enhances the stability of collective
   bargaining in the railroad and airline industries

   The primary representation dispute responsibilities of the NMB are as
   follows:
     * Conduct initial investigation of representation applications
     * Determine and certify collective bargaining representatives of
       employees
     * Ensure that the process occurs without interference, influence or
       coercion

   Arbitration

   Under the Railway Labor Act, employee grievances arising under the
   terms of collective bargaining agreements (minor disputes) are subject
   to compulsory arbitration. Effective arbitration processes are
   therefore necessary to resolve such disputes.

   Alternative Dispute Resolution and Dispute Prevention Activities

   The NMB's alternative dispute resolution and dispute prevention
   activities consist of training and education including interest-based
   bargaining and facilitation, pre-dispute mediation, and grievance
   mediation among other services. The overall goal is to help the parties
   bring about a positive change in the collective bargaining culture in
   the railroad and airline industries and achieve a more timely
   resolution of disputes. To help achieve a positive change in bargaining
   culture at a time of increasingly complex negotiations, the NMB
   initiated a training and facilitation process to assist the parties in
   undertaking innovative negotiation and dispute resolution approaches.
   In addition to training offered by the Board to the parties, the Board
   has undertaken a continuing education program for its professional
   staff to ensure that all staff receive practitioner-oriented classroom
   and on-the-job training in communications and conflict management,
   consensual decision making, group problem solving, interest-based and
   traditional bargaining, and grievance mediation.
