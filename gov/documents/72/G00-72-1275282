Dynamic Properties of Materials

   The description of the dynamic response of solids to high-velocity,
   large deformation loadings requires a mathematical description for the
   material behavior. The conditions encountered involve strains between
   0% and 200%, strain rates from .01/s to 10,000,000/s, and temperatures
   from 300K to the melting point. Nonlinear, finite deformation,
   anisotropic material response, possibly including strain-rate
   dependence, thermal softening/hardening, and failure, must be
   accurately modeled.

   Material model development is a subject of ongoing research at T-3.
   Accurate material models provide a capability for analyzing engineering
   structures and reducing the number, and hence the cost, of validation
   experiments needing in the design of engineering structures. Viable
   computational models must be compatible with the incremental, continuum
   formulations inherent to large deformation, numerical descriptions.
   Furthermore, material models that are numerically robust and
   computationally efficient are desirable for large-scale computational
   simulations.
