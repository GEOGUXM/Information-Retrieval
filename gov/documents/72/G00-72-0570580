                   ATSDR SEEKS NOMINATIONS FOR NEW MEMBERS
          TO THE OAK RIDGE RESERVATION HEALTH EFFECTS SUBCOMMITTEE
     __________________________________________________________________

   WHAT:
   Nominations for new members to participate on the Oak Ridge Reservation
   Health Effects Subcommittee are sought by the Agency for Toxic
   Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention (CDC). Both ATSDR and CDC are public health
   agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

   Individuals may nominate themselves or others. Past and current
   committee membership includes physicians, technical experts, and other
   community members with a wide range of backgrounds.

   One of the positions to be filled is specifically designated for a
   former or current Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) worker affected by an
   illness believed to have been caused by exposure to releases from the
   ORR.

   The other positions are designated for general membership.

   Those serving on the ORR Health Effects Subcommittee are special
   government employees and are paid for their time spent in official
   meetings.

   Members of the subcommittee meet on a regular basis, usually in Oak
   Ridge. The meetings are held approximately every six weeks, although
   meetings may be held more or less often, as needed. At the meetings,
   which are open to the public, staff members from ATSDR, CDC and invited
   health experts explain the scientific and technical aspects of public
   health decisions affecting the ORR site.

   Individuals nominated should hold views representative of the community
   and:
     * be at least 18 years of age
     * be current residents of the area or have lived near the Oak Ridge
       Reservation in the past
     * have knowledge of the Oak Ridge Reservation, the contaminants of
       concern, or worker health concerns

   WHERE: Nomination packets for the positions are available from ATSDRâ€™s
   Oak Ridge Field Office, 197 S. Tulane Ave., Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
   Nomination information and packets also are available on line by
   accessing the ATSDR homepage at www.atsdr.cdc.gov.
