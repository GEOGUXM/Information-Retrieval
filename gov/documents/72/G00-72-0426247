                    Extending A Gift of Love and Empathy

   The recent tragedies in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. has
   had a profound effect on all Americans.

   Civil Air Patrol members were especially touched by the attack on our
   benefactor, the US military headquarters in the Pentagon. In keeping
   with the philanthropic spirit that dwells within each CAP member, the
   Civil Air Patrol EAGLE Fund has been created. You are invited to
   participate. The EAGLE Fund has been created to provide both
   short-term and long-term disaster relief to the victims and the
   survivors of the terrorist attack upon the Pentagon on September 11.
   The Civil Air Patrol EAGLE Fund specifically provides the support of
   long-term educational, health and rehabilitation, grief counseling, and
   general support needs of the individuals and families in the
   metropolitan Washington region.
   Donations are tax-exempt to the extent allowed by law and 100 percent
   of all contributions will go to supporting those most affected by this
   national tragedy. A special post office box and account has been
   established to receive and process each gift.
   Participants in the Civil Air Patrol EAGLE Fund will be provided a gift
   receipt for tax records and will be appropriately recognized in The
   Civil Air Patrol News. The EAGLE Fund was created by order of the Civil
   Air Patrol National Commander, Brigadier General Richard L. Bowling and
   will remain in place through 31 December 2001.  Join Gen Bowling and
   thousands of fellow CAP volunteer members by providing your gift today
   and reaching out to the victims and survivors in our Nation's capitol.
