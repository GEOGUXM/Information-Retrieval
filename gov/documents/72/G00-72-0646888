   [don.libes.jpg] I'm a computer scientist at NIST where I do CS research
   to support manufacturing technology. I work in the Manufacturing
   Systems Integration Division. We take software and data from various
   vendors, and add glue - mostly in the form of custom software that
   implements draft standards - to show that it can (and sometimes cannot)
   work together. What I've been working on the last couple of years:
     * STEP - A family of ISO standards and draft standards for product
       management. I've been writing lots of tools, most of which are for
       manipulating EXPRESS models. My publication list shows most of
       these.
     * Collaboration Tools - Have a look at the NIST Identifier
       Collaboration Service. It's a free tool that may reduce your costs
       due to rapidly developing but unmanaged namespaces. [This is
       presently getting the bulk of my time.]
     * Expect - A tool for automating interactive applications such as
       telnet, ftp, passwd and hundreds of others. Get Expect to do the
       work for you where you are typing the same keystrokes everytime you
       do some task. I believe you'll find the use of Expect quite easy.

   Some papers I'm writing (or just contemplating writing) are:
     * NIST Identifier Collaboration Service
       Status: I haven't started writing this but I really should.
     * CGI Scripts in Tcl - A Tutorial
       Status: I'm thinking about the best way to do this.
     * Agents ... - various papers.

  Software

     * NICS - A service to allow collaborative management of identifiers.
     * Expect - A tool for automating interactive applications such as
       telnet, ftp, passwd and hundreds of others.
     * cgi.tcl - A comprehensive library for creating Tcl-based CGI
       scripts. cgi.tcl supports tables, cookies, file upload, Expect, Tcl
       applets, Java, etc, etc.
     * tkbiff - yet another program to alert you to incoming mail. tkbiff
       allows arbitrary commands (play audio clip, metamail, etc) to be
       executed upon mail reception. If you like programs like xbiff++ but
       wish they were more flexible or more portable, then you'll like
       tkbiff.
     * md5pure - Computes md5 message digests using only core Tcl
       commands. Surprisingly fast. (Surprised me anyway.)
     * Stopwatch - A little stopwatch - just right for helping you get the
       timing down while practicing a talk. Provided both as an applet and
       a standalone Tk script.
     * tcl-debug - A Tcl debugger. Provides traditional debugging
       capabilities to any Tcl script. Built-in to Expect but it works
       with any Tcl extension including Tk. Can be dynamically loaded.
     * I wrote a large number of tools for manipulating EXPRESS models
       including a compiler (with Steve Clark), a server, and a
       development environment (with Steve and Josh Lubell). For more
       information, see the EXPRESS documents below or the SC4 page.
     * Implementing Software Timers (reprint provided courtesy of Rich
       Stevens) simulates multiple timers given an environment that only
       provides a single timer.
     * As I get time, I'll document more of the things I've written...
