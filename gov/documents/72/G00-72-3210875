                       The Work Number for Everyone Ò

   What Is It?

   The Work Number for Everyone Ò is a new automated employment/salary
   verification service that most of the DOT operating administrations are
   using.

   When Would I Use It?

   When you apply for an apartment lease, car loan, mortgage or other type
   of credit, your lender will contact DOT to verify that you work here,
   and to verify your salary. The Work Number Ò is an automated service
   that verifiers can access 24 hours a day, seven days a week, thereby
   avoiding delays in your loan processing.

   How Do Verifiers Access This Information?

   With The Work Number Ò , no one can access your salary information
   without your permission. If you want your salary information released,
   you must provide your verifier with:

     * The DOT Company Code: 10302
     * Your social security number
     * A six digit Authorization Code (only for salary verifications)

   Verifiers will dial 1-900-555-WORK for verification.

   How Do I Get the Authorization Code to Give to a Verifier:

   Dial 1-800-EMP-AUTH (1-800-367-2884). When the system prompts you,
   enter:

     * The DOT Company Code: 10302
     * Your social security number
     * Your Personal PIN: your six digit service computation date (SCD).
       For example, if your SCD is January 1, 1980, enter 010180 when the
       system asks for a PIN. If you dont know your SCD, you may obtain
       the date from your most recent Statement of Earnings and Leave, DOT
       F2740.1.

                     Do not give your PIN to a verifier!

   The system will voice the Authorization Code to you. Be sure to record
   this number.

   How Many Authorization Codes Can I Obtain?

   You may have three Authorization Codes active at one time. An
   Authorization Code is valid for only one verification.
