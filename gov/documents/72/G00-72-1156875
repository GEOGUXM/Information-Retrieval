   ARS Strategic Plan 1997 - 2002 Working Document
   Forward

   I am pleased to present the working version of the Agricultural
   Research Service's Strategic Plan 19972002. This document is a
   supplement to the official version of the ARS Strategic Plan, which was
   submitted to Congress in October 1997 as part of the USDA Strategic
   Plan. Understandable limits on length precluded ARS from including most
   of the explanatory information that is helpful in applying this
   strategic framework to the agency's research activities. The complete
   USDA plan is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.usda.gov/:
   Open "About USDA" and click on "Strategic Plan," then scroll down the
   table to "Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area." The ARS
   Strategic Plan immediately follows the mission area plan.

   The working version of the ARS Strategic Plan 19972002 is also
   available on the ARS web site. ARS will also make the annual
   performance plans and the annual performance reports, which record
   progress towards meeting the goals and objectives of the strategic
   plan, available on the ARS web site. The FY 1999 and 2000 annual
   performance plans and FY 1998 annual performance report are already
   available at the above web address.

   ARS has developed and used a series of strategic and implementation
   plans over the last 15 to 20 years to guide its research program. The
   Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 asks Federal
   agencies to strengthen their strategic planning efforts by focusing on
   the longer term outcomes of their work. GPRA also reinforced ARS'
   strong commitment to customer service. The means ARS used to secure
   meaningful input from our customers, stakeholders, and partners are
   described in the background material included in this working version
   of the plan.

   ARS has a long and distinguished history of service to American
   agriculture. As our world becomes more interdependent, the benefits of
   ARS research will directly affect producers and consumers in all
   corners of the globe. This new strategic plan will help us guide our
   scientific activities and the accompanying transfer of our research
   products to end users, action and regulatory agencies, the private
   sector, and all other customers.

   With the continued support of the American people, the Congress, USDA,
   and our dedicated workforce committed to scientific excellence and
   public service, we will meet the challenges and opportunities presented
   in the strategic plan.

   I would like to thank the members of the ARS Strategic Planning Team
   (SPT) who worked over 2Â½ years to draft, revise, and finalize this
   plan. The members were James H. Bradley, Dale A. Bucks, Ruth Coy, James
   Elgin (retired), David A. Farrell, Roger J. Gerrits (retired), Wesley
   L. Harris (retired), Stephen Heller, Roger Lawson (retired), Ray
   Leaman, John W. Radin, Michael D. Ruff, Keith Russell, Lewis Smith, and
   Ruxton Villet. The SPT activities were coordinated by David A. Rust,
   and Nancy Gatdula provided all of the secretarial and support services
   required. This important planning process could not have been
   successfully completed without the conscientious efforts of the entire
   team.
