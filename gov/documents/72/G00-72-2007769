Message From the USGS Associate Director for Biology

     Welcome to the Biological Resources Discipline (BRD).

     The BRD mission is to work with others to provide the scientific
     understanding and technologies needed to support the sound
     management and conservation of our Nation's biological resources. A
     fundamental part of our mission is embodied in our deep commitment
     to make data and information on the Nation's biological resources
     more accessible to more people.

      I'm delighted that you've decided to take a closer look at all we
     offer.

     USGS Associate Director for Biology, Biological Resources Discipline
     (BRD)


BRD History

     Chronology

     1885 - Ornithological Office established in the Entomology Division,
     U.S. Department of Agriculture.
     1886 - Mission extended to mammals. Division of Ornithology and
     Mammalogy created.
     1896 - Name changed to the Division of Biological Survey.
     1905 - Division elevated to the Bureau of Biological Survey (BBS).
     1939 - BBS becomes part of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the
     Department of the Interior.
     1993 - Formation of the National Biological Service (NBS).
     1996 - NBS becomes part of USGS as the BRD

     In October 1996, the Biological Resources Discipline or BRD was
     established within the U.S. Geological Survey. BRD brought an
     important living resources dimension to the USGS earth sciences
     orientation, thus making it possible for the bureau to bring
     physical plus biological science to natural resource management
     problems.

     BRD works cooperatively with Federal and State agencies to share
     information necessary to develop a comprehensive picture of the
     Nation's biological resources. In fact, we are eager to recognize
     the valuable contributions of States, other Federal agencies, and
     outside organizations. Ours is a strong commitment to the use of
     partnerships to achieve objectives.

     The majority of BRD programs and resources remain directed towards
     the needs and responsibilities of Interior resource management
     bureaus, such as studies supporting development of annual waterfowl
     regulations, research leading to better land protection strategies
     for national parks, and investigations seeking optimal water control
     practices for enhancement of fisheries.

     But an equally important BRD objective has been the establishment
     and ongoing development of a National Biological Information
     Infrastructure (NBII), a network of distributed databases and
     information sources on biological resources. Today, NBII information
     is being used by Federal and State agencies, researchers,
     universities and museums, planning and environmental consultants,
     private companies, landowners, and the public.
