     __________________________________________________________________

   All files will be in Adobe PDF format, 2 slides/page.
   Note: because many of the slides in these presentations are complex the
   PDF files will not have all the detail or quality of the originals.
   Occassional some images are corrupted during conversion to PDF and some
   fine detail of figures is sometimes lost. If you see an image that
   looks like noise.. or a blank page then it was not possible to convert
   that slide to a PDF format (sorry).
