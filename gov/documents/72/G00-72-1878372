             Service the Hubble Space Telescope. The STS-82 mission is the
             second in a series of planned servicing missions to the orbiting
             Hubble Space Telescope (HST). HST was placed in orbit on April
             24, 1990 by the Space Shuttle Discovery on STS-31. The first
             servicing mission was done by Space Shuttle Endeavour on STS-61.
             Work performed on the telescope will significantly upgrade the
             scientific capabilities of the HST and keep the telescope
             functioning smoothly until the next scheduled servicing missions
             in 1999 and 2002.

             Starting on the third day of the mission, the seven-member crew
             will conduct at least four spacewalks (also called
             Extravehicular Activities or EVAs) to remove two older
             instruments and install two new astronomy instruments, as well
             as other servicing tasks. The two older instruments being
             replaced are the Goddard High Resolution Spectrometer and the
             Faint Object Spectrograph. Replacing these instruments are the
             Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near
             Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS). HST's
             current complement of science instruments includes two cameras,
             two spectrographs, and fine guidance sensors.

             In addition to installing the new instruments, astronauts will
             replace other existing hardware with upgrades and spares. Hubble
             will get a refurbished Fine Guidance Sensor, an optical device
             that is used on HST to provide pointing information for the
             spacecraft and is used as a scientific instrument for
             astrometric science. The Solid State Recorder (SSR) will replace
             one of HST's current reel-to-reel tape recorders. The SSR
             provides much more flexibility than a reel-to-reel recorder and
             can store ten times more data. One of Hubble's four Reaction
             Wheel Assemblies (RWA) will be replaced with a refurbished
             spare. The RWA is part of Hubble's Pointing Control Subsystem.
             The RWAs use spin momentum to move the telescope into position.
             The wheels also maintain the spacecraft in a stable position.
             The wheel axes are oriented so that the telescope can provide
             science with only three wheels operating, if required.

   Launch:

             Launch February 11, 1997 3:55:17 am. Window was 65 minutes. The
             exact window was announced a few hours before launch and
             adjusted at the T-9 minute mark based on the final computation
             of the location of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). In Firing
             Room 3, of the Launch Control Center (LCC), a final poll of the
             launch team and the Mission Management Team was conducted and
             the countdown clock picked up at the T-9 minute mark at 3:47am
             EST. The Orbiter Access Arm (OAA) was retracted at T-7 minute 21
             seconds (3:50am EST) and a go was given for APU prestart at
             3:50am EST. The APU's were started at the T-5 minute mark and
             the flight crew reported 3 good APU's. Discovery's aero surfaces
             were sequenced and the three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME's)
             were moved into launch position. Launch occured exactly on
             schedule. Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB's) were seperated at 2
             minutes 2 seconds with Discovery at an altitude 35nm and a
             distance of 40 miles from launch site.

             The launch countdown was conducted with minimal problems.
             Loading of the cryogenic reactants into the external tank began
             at 8:30 p.m. EST on February 10, 1997. Tanking was delayed about
             1 1/2 hours in order to send a contingency team into the Mobile
             Launcher Platform (MLP) at the pad to assess the integrity of
             the gaseous nitrogen purge system. This was done as part of the
             troubleshooting effort to understand why unusually high
             concentrations of oxygen were appearing in the orbiter's payload
             bay. Once the team cleared the pad, tanking commenced. The high
             readings of oxygen in the orbiter's midbody and payload bay had
             stabilized but engineers continued to monitor them as the
             countdown proceeded. Tanking started about 1.5 hours late and
             engineers determined the excess oxygen in the payload bay was
             due to trapped gas in the honeycomb structures of the payload
             bay. An earlier concern with fuel cell No. 3 was cleared and the
             fuel cell was operating properly. An additional check of the
             fuel cell's pH level was taken at about T-3 hours before launch
             as a final confirmation.
             The seven members of the STS-82 crew were awakened at 7:30
             tonight and departed the Operations and Checkout Building for
             the pad at about 12:31am. Milestones for launch day (Reference
             KSC Press Release 20-97) start the day with close-out
             preparations in the white room and the checking of cockpit
             switch configurations. Then at about 1:01 a.m. EST, the Flight
             crew begins entry into the orbiter and the atronauts perform
             air-to-ground voice checks with Launch Control and Mission
             Control. At about 2:26 a.m., Discovery's crew hatch should close
             and the Eastern Range begins final network open loop command
             checks. Then the hatch is sealed and cabin leak checks
             performed. Then white room is closed-out and the Close-out crew
             moves to fallback area.

             At L-1 day, Air Force weather forecasters indicated a 30 percent
             probability of weather prohibiting launch on Tuesday. By launch
             day that estimate was changed to 20 percent. A disturbance
             developing over the South Central U.S. is expected to possibly
             increase cloudiness through Monday. At launch time, the only
             concerns are for low and mid level clouds. At launch time, the
             temperature at the pad is expected to be about 56 degrees;
             relative humidity about 86 percent; clouds scattered at 2,500
             feet and 14,000 feet and broken at 25,000 feet; pad winds from
             the northwest at 12-18 knots.

             On Sunday, Febuary 9, 1997, Pad 39A was cleared early in the
             morning to load the onboard cryogenic tanks with liquid hydrogen
             and liquid oxygen reactants. Reactant loading was completed and
             off-load of several hundred pounds of the cryogenics not
             required for this mission continued through most of the day. The
             reactants provide electricity for the orbiter and crew while in
             space and drinking water as a by-product for the 10-day mission.
             At about 10 a.m. on 2/10/97, checks of the fuel cells were done
             to evaluate the pH content of the water by-product. Also,
             engineers evaluated higher than allowable oxygen readings in the
             orbiter's midbody following cryogenic loading today. (Reference
             KSC Shuttle Status 2/09/1997)

             On Thursday, February 6, 1997, during aft close-out operations,
             cycle tests on two aft engine compartment vent doors revealed an
             intermittent failure of the doors to operate properly.
             Troubleshooting of this problem concluded that the power drive
             unit (PDU) for the vent doors had a bad circuit. Managers this
             afternoon decided to replace the PDU. The additional work will
             delay aft close-outs but should not impact launch on Tuesday.
             The aft doors are now scheduled to be installed Saturday night.
             The countdown remains on schedule to begin at 4 a.m. on February
             8, 1997. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 2/07/1997)

             The seven STS-82 crew members arrived at KSC on Friday, Feb. 7,
             at 7:30am. The launch countdown will begin at the T-43 hour mark
             at 4 a.m. EST Saturday, Feb. 8. Launch is currently targeted for
             3:56 a.m. EST on Tuesday, Feb. 11, at the opening of a 65-minute
             launch window. (Reference KSC Press Release 20-97)

             On 2/4/97, cryogenic servicing of the Near Infrared Camera and
             Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) continued and the payload
             end-to-end test began. Aft engine compartment close-outs
             continued and the aft doors scheduled to be installed on
             Saturday (2/8/97). The crew is scheduled to arrive at KSC Friday
             morning (2/7/97) and the countdown is set to begin Saturday.
             (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 2/04/1997)

             On 1/31/97, during the Flight Readiness Review (FRR) in the
             mission briefing room of the Operations and Checkout Building
             (O&C) at KSC, the mission management team selected February 11,
             1997 as the official launch date for STS-82. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 1/31/1997)

             On 1/29/97, payloads were installed into the orbiter's payload
             bay and space suits used for the mission were installed into the
             orbiters airlock. This weekend, workers will remove and replace
             the Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) nozzle plugs from the SRBs at the
             pad. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 1/29/1997)
             On 1/17/97, Discovery began its journey from the VAB to the
             launch pad shortly after 7 a.m. Rollout was stopped at
             approximately 8:25 a.m. after engineers heard a "load band" and
             noticed that a crack had developed on deck plating of MLP-1. The
             24-foot long "Y"-shaped crack is on the surface of the MLP and
             runs from near the left hand SRB flame hole toward the near
             corner of the MLP. Structural engineers have determined the
             integrity of the MLP has not been compromised and Discovery's
             trip to the launch pad resumed shortly after noon EST.
             (Reference KSC Press Release 13-97)

             On 12/18/96, work on the airlock hatch actuators continued. The
             Ku-band deployable assembly (DA) will be removed and replaced
             with the DA from Columbia. A retest of the antenna is scheduled
             for 12/19/96 and the payload bay doors will be closed for the
             holidays on 12/20/96. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 11/18/1996)

             The left hand orbital maneuvering system pod was installed on
             11/16/96 and interface verification testing will begin 11/21/96.
             Fuel cell No. 1 will be removed and replaced on Friday. Stacking
             of the solid Vehicle Assembly Building. (Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 11/20/1996)

             On 11/4/96, the orbiter docking system was stowed for flight and
             the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) #2 wiring work was completed.
