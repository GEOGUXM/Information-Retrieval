   Division Office Members
   The EES Division mission is to contribute to the solution of complex
   problems of national importance in the areas of energy resources,
   environmental quality, and national security. Our approach to solving
   these problems is to apply strengths in observation, modeling and
   experimentation, all anchored to a solid foundation of excellent,
   cutting edge science. We contribute through research and development in
   geological, geophysical, environmental and biological sciences. We also
   contribute to our national science and technology base through
   education, scientific research, and industrial competitiveness.
