     NASA Marshalls friction stir welding technology successfully
     commercialized by two companies

     Two companies have successfully commercialized a specialized welding
     tool developed at NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
     Ala.

     Commercialization of auto-adjustable pin tool technology 혰 used in
     the friction stir welding process 혰 marks another success for NASAs
     technology transfer program. The program seeks to stimulate broad
     use of NASA-developed technologies by American private enterprise.

     Friction stir welding uses the high rotational speed of a tool and
     the resulting frictional heat created from contact to crush, stir
     together, and forge a bond between two metal alloys. The technique
     is more reliable and maintains higher material properties than
     conventional welding methods. However, friction stir welding has had
     a major drawback 혰 reliance on a single-piece pin tool. The pin is
     slowly plunged into the joint between two materials to be welded and
     rotated at high speed. At the end of the weld, the single-piece pin
     tool is retracted and leaves a keyhole, something which is
     unacceptable when welding cylindrical objects such as drums, pipes
     and storage tanks. Another drawback is the requirement for
     different-length pin tools when welding materials of varying
     thickness.

     To overcome these drawbacks, a Marshall Center welding engineer
     helped design an automatic retractable pin tool that uses a
     computer-controlled motor to automatically retract the pin into the
     shoulder of the tool at the end of the weld 혰 preventing keyholes.
     This design allows the pin angle and length to be adjusted for
     changes in material thickness and results in a smooth hole closure
     at the end of the weld.

     MTS Systems Corp., a leading supplier of mechanical testing and
     simulation equipment based in Eden Prairie, Minn., recently
     introduced an advanced friction stir welding process system
     employing Marshalls retractable pin tool technology. Use of the tool
     by MTS has resulted in applications that are cost-competitive,
     efficient and versatile for automotive, shipbuilding and other
     industries. This Marshall technology also has helped the company
     gain market share in the growing friction stir welding niche and
     develop additional business relationships.

     Another company, MCE Technologies, Inc., (MCETEC) of Seattle, has
     developed a cutting-edge line of production stir welding equipment
     that uses Marshalls retractable pin tool technology to provide
     flawless welds in high performance aluminum alloys, including those
     previously thought unweldable. The companys use of the retractable
     pin tool has contributed to production advantages including minimal
     material distortion, lack of contamination and greater joint
     strength for friction stir welding applications in aerospace and
     other industries. Additionally, working with the Marshall Center has
     helped MCETEC remain a stable employer by improving its product
     offering to the friction stir welding market.

     Applications for friction stir welding include aircraft, aerospace,
     marine shipbuilding and decks for car ferries, trucking, railroading
     and assembling large tank structures such as fuel tanks and
     radioactive waste containers.

     Benefits of friction stir welding, using the Marshall Centers
     retractable pin tool technology, include:
     * Diverse materials: Welds a wide range of alloys, including
       previously unweldable and composite materials.
     * Durable joints: Provides twice the fatigue resistance of fusion
       welds and no keyholes.
     * Retention of material properties: Minimizes material distortion.
     * Safe operation: Does not create hazards such as welding fumes,
       radiation, high voltage, liquid metals or arcing.
     * No keyholes: Pin is retracted automatically at end of weld.
     * Tapered-thickness weld joints: Pin maintains full penetration.
