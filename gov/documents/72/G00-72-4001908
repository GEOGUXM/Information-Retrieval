     On January 10, 2002, the Drug Enforcement Administration, together
     with the U.S. Customs Service, Internal Revenue Service and the
     Royal Canadian Mounted Police, announced the arrests of more than
     100 individuals in twelve cities in connection with a nationwide

     Pseudoephedrine is an essential precursor chemical used to
     manufacture the illegal drug, methamphetamine.

                      National Young Leaders Conference

     photo of Administrator Hutchinson "In the last 15 years, we've
     reduced cocaine usage by 75 percent. That's 4 million people fewer
     using cocaine today than 15 years ago. That's a measure of success.
     Overall drug usage has declined by one-half over the last 20 years.
     That's a significant amount of success because those 4 million
     people who are not using drugs could be your family member. Those
     are lives that are saved. Clearly, we have reached a plateau, and
     we've reached a level of frustration because it's a little more
     difficult to edge the number of drug users down further. But I
     believe we have the opportunity to make further inroads." - Asa
     Hutchinson, Administrator

                       Innovative Drug Strategy (IDEA)

   IDEA logo Asa Hutchinson, Administrator of the Drug Enforcement
   Administration announced today a coordinated anti-drug plan that
   combines law enforcement with intensive community follow-up designed to
   reduce drug demand. The program, entitled IDEA for Integrated Drug
   Enforcement Assistance, will team the DEA with state and local law
   enforcement to arrest and prosecute the most significant drug
   traffickers within designated communities, and will then form
   coalitions to reduce demand through drug prevention and treatment.

                              December 11, 2001

   photo of the OxyCodone molecule Purdue Pharma introduced OxyContin® in
   1995 as a controlled release formulation of OxyCodone, intended for use
   in the treatment of chronic moderate to severe pain when a continuous,
   potent, narcotic pain reliever is needed for an extended period.
   OxyContin® contains a large amount of active ingredient compared to
   other narcotic products. In addition to oral abuse of the intact
   tablet, crushing the tablet enables abusers to circumvent the
   controlled release mechanism and to swallow, snort, or inject the drug
   for a more rapid and intense high. OxyContin® has become the number one
   prescribed Schedule II narcotic in the United States. Increasing abuse
   of OxyContin® has led to an increase of associated criminal activity.
