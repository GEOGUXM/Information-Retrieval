   [arrow-bl-rt.gif] Escorting U.S. Citizens Into Security Areas

   NOTE: The Badge Office is no longer involved in controlling and
   approving escorting.  Escorting is now arranged directly between the
   escortee's host organization and the facility that is being visited.
   S-5 is the responsible organization for the Laboratory's escorting
   program.
   [arrow-bl-rt.gif] Uncleared Foreign Nationals
   NOTE: Except for badging, the approval and tracking of uncleared
   foreign nationals is not a Badge Office procedure. The Foreign Visits
   and Assignments Program of the Internal Security Office is responsible.
