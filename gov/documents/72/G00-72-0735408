   If you are not sure if the nature of your complaint fits within the
   examples listed above, submit your complaint anyway.

   Before you file a complaint with the California Department of
   Insurance, you should first contact the insurance company, agent or
   broker in an effort to resolve the issue(s). If you do not receive a
   satisfactory response, then complete a Request for Assistance form.
   (Occasionally the issue may be of such a nature that attempting to
   contact the insurance company, agent, or broker first may not be
   appropriate. In these situations it would be appropriate to contact the
   Department first.) When doing so, please provide as much information as
   space allows. Information in red is required. Failure to provide this
   information may delay or even prevent our ability to be of assistance.
   We consider this information necessary to our review and within the
   powers and duties expressed in the California Insurance Code, Section
   12921.3. If you are concerned about submitting information over the
   Internet, please review our privacy statement regarding information we
   obtain from you.

   Please be aware that a copy of your Request for Assistance may be
   provided to the insurance company, agent or broker unless you indicate
   that you do not want a copy of your Request for Assistance forwarded.

   Once your Request is assigned within our office, you will be given
   instructions regarding methods of submitting supporting documentation.
   Supporting documentation includes any documents (preferably copies)
   related to your problem such as the declaration page of your insurance
   policy or certificate, canceled checks, letters or correspondence. The
   more complete the information we receive, the quicker we can identify
   the issues and begin our review. You may inspect the information you
   submit at any time as long as the department's case is maintained. All
   original documents will be returned to you upon completion of our
   handling.

   If you have an attorney representing you in this matter or if there is
   a lawsuit currently on-going or pending, do not complete this Request
   for Assistance. Once the matter is concluded, we would welcome any
   information regarding violations of law by the insurer that you are
   willing to provide.

   The time it takes to handle a request for assistance can vary greatly,
   depending on how complex the matter is. Please be assured, your request
   will be handled as quickly as possible.
