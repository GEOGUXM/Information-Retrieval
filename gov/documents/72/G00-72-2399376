   Isotope Explorer is a Windows application to interactively access and
   display nuclear data and to search for literature references. Isotope
   Explorer can retrieve data via the Internet or it can use data stored
   locally.

   The program can display level drawings, coincidences, tables, band
   plots, nuclear charts, chart data and literature references - see
   figures on the left.

   Isotope Explorer supports a nuclear chart interface, it can display
   systematics of nuclear properties by color coding a nuclear chart, and
   it can perform complex searches and calculations with the built-in
   script language.
