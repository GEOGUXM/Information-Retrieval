   MISSIONS - Jason-1

   Artists concept of the Jason-1 spacecraft in space Jason-1 is the first
   follow-on to the highly successful TOPEX/Poseidon mission that measured
   ocean surface topography to an accuracy of 4.2 cm, enabled scientists
   to forecast the 1997-1998 El Ni√±o, and improved understanding of ocean
   circulation and its effect of global climate. The joint NASA-CNES
   program will launch a French spacecraft on an American Delta II from an
   American base. Like TOPEX/Poseidon, the payload will include both
   American and French instruments. Jason-1 altimeter data will be part of
   a suite of data provided by other JPL-managed ocean missions--the GRACE
   mission will use two satellites to accurately measure Earth's mass
   distribution, and the QuikSCAT scatterometer mission will measure
   ocean-surface winds.

   What's New

   Jason-1 Mission Status
   01/11/02

   Jason-1 and TOPEX/Poseidon in calibration phase The joint NASA/French
   Space Agency oceanography satellite Jason-1 has reached its operational
   orbit and begun six months of instrument calibrations with its sister
   spacecraft, TOPEX/Poseidon.

   Jason-1 is now approximately one minute (approximately 370 kilometers
   or 230 miles) ahead of the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite, on an identical
   ground track.

   "Jason-1 has begun observations of the same spot of the ocean surface
   as TOPEX/Poseidon under nearly identical conditions," said Dr.
   Lee-Lueng Fu, Jason 1 project scientist at JPL. "These unprecedented
   observations will allow mission scientists to calibrate and validate
   the new measurements from Jason-1 with those of TOPEX/Poseidon. The
   combined data records will enable us to study long-term changes in the
   ocean and their effects on climate."
