   Earthquake Activity in the Long Valley area

     * Map of earthquake locations in past 7 days, including list of
       events
     * Seismograms for Long Valley seismometers

   Seismic network

     Earthquakes occurring in the Long Valley area are recorded by a
     network of 18 seismic stations within the caldera and an additional 20
     stations within a distance of 50 km beyond the caldera boundary. These
     stations comprise parts of both the Northern California Seismic Network
     (NCSN) operated by the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California
     (stations names ending in M), and the Nevada seismic network operated
     by the University of Nevada, Reno (station names ending in R). The
     signals from the combined stations are shared by both networks. The
     signals telemetered to USGS headquarters in Menlo Park are processed
     along with data from the rest of the Northern California Seismic
     Network and archived on a mass storage device at the University of
     California, Berkeley - USGS data center.



   Ground Deformation in the Long Valley area

    Tiltmeters

     * Longbase tilt data, past 7 days (+NS=South down tilt; +EW=East down
       tilt)
     * Longbase tilt data, past 30 days (+NS=South down tilt; +EW=East
       down tilt)
     * Shortbase tilt data, past 7 days (detrended, +NS=North down tilt;
       +EW=East down tilt)

    Dilational strain

     * Past 7 days (Detrended, Pressure loading removed)
     * Past 30 days (Pressure loading removed)

    Geodetic - 2-color geodimeter

     * Data
     * Map of two-color benchmarks in Long Valley

    Continuous GPS

     * USGS GPS continuous data (precision is about 3 mm in horizontal and
       about 8 mm in vertical
     * USGS GPS displacement Vector data



   Other Monitroing in the Long Valley area

    Magnetometers

     * USGS Magnetometer data and map of site locations. The instruments
       measure local changes in the earth's magnetic field. Over short
       time periods they can detect changes of as small as 1/50,000th of
       the earth's magnetic field.

    Carbon dioxide gas

     * Carbon dioxide and helium discharge from Mammoth Mountain

    Hydrologic data

     * Hot springs, streams, and wells
