   Eastern Region Logo

   The Washington State Department of Transportation/Eastern Region is
   based in Spokane, Washington. We build and maintain the state-owned
   highway system over a seven county region in the northeast portion of
   the state.

   Engineering and support services are located in Spokane. Engineers
   design and manage highway construction projects and inspect the work of
   private contractors to ensure that projects are built to
   specifications.

   The Maintenance Division has four areas with offices in Spokane,
   Colfax, Davenport, and Colville. Maintenance crews are based in
   equipment sheds throughout the seven county region. Maintenance is
   responsible for the day-to-day upkeep of the system, as well as snow
   and ice control in the winter months.

   There are approximately 1,700 miles of state highways within the
   Eastern Region.

                                                                  Projects
