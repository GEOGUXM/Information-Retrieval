   WorkFirst Evaluation Database

       _______________________________________________________________

   To assess the success of the WorkFirst program in assisting clients to
   become employed and to reduce their use of welfare, the Institute
   created a database that tracks the experiences of WorkFirst clients.
   The WorkFirst evaluation database links client employment and welfare
   records across multiple WorkFirst agency information systems.  The 2001
   Legislature asked the Institute to maintain and update the WorkFirst
   evaluation database through June 2003.  The database will help
   Institute staff answer questions about the WorkFirst program and will
   support ongoing evaluation efforts.  Maintaining this research asset
   avoids the considerable startup costs associated with recreating a
   similar database in the future.

   The Institute will work closely with key legislative staff to develop a
   research agenda that anticipates areas of legislative interest.  The
   WorkFirst database allows the Institute to respond to questions on a
   wide variety of topics related to WorkFirst. Among them
     * Caseload trends
     * Client demographic characteristics, welfare use, Medicaid coverage,
       and employment outcomes
     * Client participation in WorkFirst activities such as job search
     * Use of childcare subsidies, car repairs, and other support services
     * Regional, local, and administrative area analysis

   The database will be maintained and updated through June 2003.
