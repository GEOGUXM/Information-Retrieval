   Michael Thompson

   Interests/Expertise(non-technical language):I grew up in an urban
          setting, but had strong interests in soil and water conservation
          and in the history of the Earth. I work with other soil
          scientists and graduate students to understand how water,
          colloids, and pollutants behave in the soil. Our research is
          aimed at understanding how soils can be managed to prevent the
          movement of pollutants such as radionuclides and hazardous
          metals through the soil.

          Interests/Expertise (technical language): Current focus is in
          soil mineralogy, especially investigations of the formation and
          transport of colloidal organomineral complexes, their impact on
          soil morphology, and their behavior in ecosystems.

   techniques for analysis of environmental samples using argon- and
   air-plasma ICP-AES, with laser ablation and solution nebulization
   sample introduction techniques.
