   Around the world, K-12 students are making scientific observations and
   reporting their data to the GLOBE Data Archive for use in research. For
   a school to participate in GLOBE, at least one teacher must be trained
   in the GLOBE science measurement protocols and education activites by
   attending a GLOBE Teacher Workshop. If you are in the United States,
   you can request more information about GLOBE Teacher Training Workshops
   using these pages. If you are outside the United States, contact your
   GLOBE Country Coordinator about training opportunities in your country.
