                     Corporate Outreach & Collaborations

              Partnerships in Support of Science & Engineering

   The NHMFL is extensively engaged with private industry, federal
   agencies and institutions, and international organizations to advance
   magnet technologies that enhance high field research. NHMFL scientists
   and engineers regularly collaborate with partner organizations, and the
   laboratory is seeing an increasing interest in magnet technologies for
   new and diverse applications.

   For example, the NHMFL is working closely with the U.S. Navy, FSU, the
   FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, and numerous private sector partners
   to develop advanced power systems that will support the Navy's
   all-electric ship program. This R&D effort for the next-generation of
   ship propulsion is expected to have broad applications in aerospace,
   commercial industry, and electric utilities. The interim director of
   the Center for Advanced Power Systems is Jim Ferner, 850-644-9630,
   ferner@magnet.fsu.edu.

   For further information about collaborating with the NHMFL, contact
   Janet Patten, Director of Government and Public Relations,
   850-644-9651, patten@magnet.fsu.edu.

   The summary below highlights some the laboratory's diverse outreach
   activities from 1995-1999.

Private Sector Activities

   The NHMFL engaged in two major R&D activities with the 45 Tesla (T)
   Hybrid magnet and the 900 MHz wide bore NMR magnet. These major
   projects have engaged the private sector from the design stages and
   with considerable impact on American industry. In the case of the
   hybrid magnet, over twenty different companies have been involved with
   this state-of-the-art magnet system. In particular, the NHMFL worked
   closely with Intermagetics General Corporation (IGC) to jointly develop
   the impregnation procedures for the Nb3Sn coils. The collaboration with
   IGC also resulted in the unique and new manufacturing capabilities in
   the United States with Gibson Tube to produce world-record lengths of
   high quality superconducting cable-in-conduit con-ductors. Everson
   Electric worked with the NHMFL to develop the insulation and
   impregnation technology for the 33 double pancakes used in coil C of
   the Hybrid.

   Many of the components of the 60 T Long-Pulse (LP) magnet were
   fabricated in the private sector, a strategy that established
   additional technical capability within the private sector. OMG Americas
   produced high strength, high conductivity copper conductor in
   previously unachieved combinations of cross-section and length. Everson
   Electric co-developed with the NHMFL the methods for fabricating the
   large, high strength 60 T LP magnet coil set. This approach continues
   with the on-going 100 T non-destructive magnet project, for which the
   NHMFL has again successfully engaged both OMG Americas and IGC to
   produce conductor in even better combinations of strength,
   conductivity, cross-section, and length.

   The fact that no NMR spectrometer over 300 MHz has been manufactured
   commercially in the United States motivated the NHMFL to engage
   American industry in the development of the 900 MHz wide-bore NMR
   magnet. IGC rose to the challenge and partnered with the laboratory
   with the monetary commitment of $1 million to the project. While
   several foreign commercial concerns are currently pursuing 900 MHz,
   none are developing wide-bore spectrometers. The NHMFL is hopeful that
   IGC will utilize the technology transfer gained in this project to
   commercialize ultra-high field NMR instruments.

   The NHMFL Pulsed Field Facility at Los Alamos entered into a CRADA in
   1996 with Dow Chemical Co. to study polymer and liquid crystal
   processing in high magnetic fields. A special furnace was constructed
   for polymer processing at temperatures up to 200 degree Centigrade in a
   20 T superconducting magnet system. Today, processing in high magnetic
   fields has gained more prominence in the commercial sector.

   The NHMFL teamed with DuPont Superconductivity and Carpco and received
   one of six Department of Energy Superconductivity Partnership
   Initiative grants to develop a high temperature superconducting
   magnetic ore separation system. The goal of this three-year project is
   to build a working prototype ore separator system using a
   conductively-cooled high temperature superconducting magnet which will
   be assembled and tested at the NHMFL.

   An increasing number of companies utilize the unique materials testing
   and characterization facilities at the NHMFL. For example, General
   Atomics Inc. conducts tests to help determine low temperature physical
   property data on large support struts for the company's Superconducting
   Mine Countermeasure Systems. This collaborative work is providing
   designers with the data necessary to develop a superconducting magnet
   system for the U.S. Naval Surface Warfare Center.

   General Atomics Inc., the Superconductivity Technology Center and the
   NHMFL in Los Alamos teamed for a DOE-funded project to design, build
   and successfully test a High-Temperature Superconducting Fault Current
   Limiter for Southern California Edison. This project received
   recognition in 1999 as the highest-rated success among all DOE Applied
   High-Tc Superconductivity projects.

Inter-Institutional Activities

   The NHMFL is collaborating with practically all of the Department of
   Energy national laboratories on a variety of projects that principally
   utilize the rich engineering resources of the laboratory's Magnet
   Science & Technology group. With Argonne National Laboratory, the NHMFL
   is performing magnet design studies to add magnet configurations to the
   Advanced Photon Source. Similar design studies are examining the
   feasibility of building and operating a muon-muon collider at the Fermi
   National Accelerator Laboratory. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
   uses the NHMFL's Large Magnet Component Test Lab to measure the current
   transport characteristics of Rutherford-style superconducting cables
   for dipole magnet development. The NHMFL is developing a split-pair
   pulsed magnet for the Los Alamos Neutron Science Division (LANSCE) that
   is being funded by DOE. For Brookhaven National Laboratory, the NHMFL
   is designing magnets for a muon and electron number violation
   experiment. Collaborating with the Radiographic Physics Department at
   Sandia National Laboratories, the NHMFL is developing a pulsed high
   magnetic field system for the advanced hydrodynamic radiography program
   to generate an intensive electron beam. In addition, interactions with
   Sandia are laying the groundwork for the development of nanocantilevers
   for the users community.

   The NHMFL's mission places it at the forefront of materials research.
   Recently, the NHMFL has provided the U.S. Army Research Laboratory at
   Aberdeen Proving Ground with samples of an ultra high-strength,
   high-conductivity conductor commercially produced with NHMFL
   sponsorship. The NHMFL and the U.S. Army are characterizing this new
   material and sharing test results.

   The NHMFL recognizes the extraordinary support that has been provided
   by the State of Florida and wants to reciprocate in the most
   appropriate means possible. The need to encourage and expand industrial
   and economic growth in North Florida and Tallahassee is a priority with
   state and local elected officials. Senior management at the NHMFL
   actively participates in organized coalitions to promote the potential
   of the region and area. The NHMFL was one of the co-founders of the
   Gulf Coast Alliance for Technology Transfer that provides an excellent
   vehicle and network to exchange technologies among nine federal and
   defense laboratories and five universities in northwestern Florida and
   southern Alabama. The alliance provides specialized support to take
   shelf technologies to commercialization. A new position is being sought
   with Florida State University to hire a Corporate Liaison Officer at a
   senior level for the NHMFL. This individual will be totally dedicated
   to pursuing the numerous corporate development affiliations that are
   generated by the unique facility and human resources that exist at the
   laboratory.

International Activities

   The expertise generated in the design and fabrication of high field
   research magnets have extended far beyond Florida and Los Alamos to
   Europe, Asia, and Australia. The NHMFL pulsed field magnets have become
   an increasingly popular commodity among other pulsed field laboratories
   around the globe and our reliable pulsed magnets are being fabricated
   for the following organizations: Technische Universitat in Austria;
   University of Braunschweig, Dresden Research Centre, and
   Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe University in Germany; University of New South
   Wales in Australia; Ruppin Institute of Higher Education in Israel; and
   Service National des Champs Magnetiques Pulses in France. In addition,
   the NHMFL has readily provided specialized technical information
   related to high field magnet technology and high-strength materials to
   the magnet laboratories at the University of Amsterdam and the
   Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

   Researchers involved with the NHMFL's Pulsed Field Magnets at Los
   Alamos and Tallahassee have maintained a long-standing relationship
   with the Bochvar Institute in Moscow, Russia. As a result, high quality
   Cu-Nb micro-composite wires with outstanding characteristics (strength,
   conductivity, and resistive ratio) were developed and are now available
   for the construction of high field coils. Another activity concerns the
   development of stainless-steel-clad copper conductors in long lengths
   and large cross sections. Both types of conductors are of great
   importance to the 100 T development project (outsert and inner coils)
   and other high field user magnet systems with long decay times.

   Likewise, the 30- to 33-T class resistive magnets designed and
   engineered by the NHMFL are being procured by the National Research
   Institute for Metals (NRIM) in Tsukuba, Japan. The Japanese laboratory
   purchased a 30 T magnet that was delivered in 1997. A later contractual
   agreement with NRIM has provided replacement coils for the 30 T magnet.
   Collaborations with the Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory have
   generated cost savings measures in resistive magnets for both
   laboratories. Construction of two nearly identical magnets for 20 MW,
   20 T, 20 cm bore systems have brought high field and wide bore
   capabilities not available elsewhere.

   Similar discussions with Grenoble are underway to design and fabricate
   two split-coil magnets for each facility. A Memorandum of Understanding
   was signed with the Nijmegen High Field Magnet Laboratory in 1999 to
   pursue joint production of resistive magnet coils for the major upgrade
   of this facility.

   The breadth and scope of all these important collaborations are yet
   another indication as to the importance of maintaining U.S. leadership
   in advancing magnet technology in pursuit of the highest magnetic field
   research.
