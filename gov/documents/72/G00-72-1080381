  Note: The CMB RoPE project was terminated in February 2001 after several
unsuccessful attempts to eliminate systematic interference.  The student team
   who had been working on RoPE is now designing a 5 GHz receiver for the
  Galactic Emission Mapping Project.  This web site may be updated with GEM
information in the future.  At the moment, there is only an archival copy of
                           the old CMB RoPE site.

   CMB RoPE (Cosmic Microwave Background ROtating Polarization Experiment)
   is an experiment to measure the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave
   Background.

Introduction

        Leading cosmological models predict that anisotropies will be
   present in the CMB polarization as well as its temperature. Recent
   confirmations of intensity anisotropies virtually guarantee that
   variations in the polarization level are also present in the background
   radiation, carrying with it more information about the state of the
   early universe. Detecting the polarization, however, has proved an
   experimental challenge. Experiments so far have only succeeded in
   setting upper limits on the level of polarization. Recent experiments
   have reached the upper limit level of ~ 20 microKelvin, an order of
   magnitude higher than most favorable theoretical predictions.

        Although detecting signals at the level of a few microKelvin is a
   daunting task, there is a much to be gained from determining the
   polarization content of the CMB. Knowing the polarization distribution
   gives us a way of independently confirming previous intensity
   anisotropy measurements by correlating the peaks and valleys of both
   distributions. In addition, determining the polarization level will
   allow discrimination among various cosmological models that predict
   differing levels of polarized radiation from the CMB.  Our experiment
   does not really address these issues; we just want to see that
   polarization exists.

        We are constructing a polarimeter to look for CMB polarization at
   an angular scale of 2 degrees.
