   Background: The Administrative Review Board ("ARB") was established by
   Secretary's Order 2-96 (Apr. 17, 1996), and began operations on May 3,
   1996. The ARB replaced the Office of Administrative Appeals, the Wage
   Appeals Board and the Board of Service Contract Appeals, and is
   designated to issues final agency decisions under a number of laws
   where such decisions were previously issued by the Secretary of Labor.
   See Secretary's Order 2-96 (Authority and Responsibilities of the
   Administrative Review Board), 61 Fed. Reg. 19978 (1996), and Final Rule
   Establishing Adminstrative Review Board, 61 Fed. Reg. 19982 (1996).
