               Chao Launches Partnership To Protect WTC Site Workers

   WASHINGTON -- U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao today announced a
   new partnership with the City of New York, contractors and other
   organizations to protect the safety and health of thousands of workers
   at the World Trade Center disaster site.

   "Those who work at Ground Zero are selflessly exposing themselves to
   serious hazards every day," Chao said. "This is a remarkable
   partnership to ensure the safety of these heroes as much as possible,
   because we can't let the terrorists claim another American life." [See

   The WTC Emergency Project Partnership Agreement formalizes a commitment
   to safety and health among contractors, employees, employee
   representatives, and governmental agencies participating in the
   emergency response efforts in lower Manhattan. The agreement was signed
   by Chao and others today in a ceremony during the Construction Industry
   Partnership's Safety Conference at the Sheraton Manhattan Hotel. [WTC

   In addition to OSHA, participants in the partnership are: the New York
   City Department of Design and Construction and the Fire Department of
   New York (co-Incident Commanders); Building and Construction Trades
   Council of Greater New York; Building Trades Employers' Association;
   Contractors Association of Greater New York; General Contractors
   Association; and the four prime contractors at the WTC site: AMEC
   Construction Management, Inc.; Bovis Lend Lease LMB, Inc.; Tully
   Construction Co., Inc.; and Turner/Plaza Construction Joint Venture.

   The partnership agreement outlines a cooperative effort to ensure a
   safe work environment. New safety and health initiatives have already
   begun, including a new site orientation training program and
   establishment of a safety committee that includes representatives from
   labor and management organizations as well as OSHA and other
   participating agencies. The orientation program familiarizes workers
   with potential hazards and personal protective equipment requirements.

   John Henshaw, OSHA Administrator, praised the partnership for its
   commitment to worker safety and health. "The World Trade Center site is
   potentially the most dangerous workplace in the United States," he
   said. "Our challenge is to ensure the September 11 tragedy claims no
   more victims in terms of fatalities or serious injuries or illnesses.
   That challenge demands a cooperative, highly coordinated effort. This
   partnership provides the framework for that effort."
