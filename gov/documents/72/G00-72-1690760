   Public Housing consists of 636 housing units in seven separate
   facilities, located on six sites. These HUD units, consisting of
   elderly/disabled and family housing units, are owned and operated by
   The Topeka Housing Authority. Each site has its own distinct appearance
   and setting.

   All potential residents of these seven Public Housing sites are
   screened for their criminal background and rental history before they
   are admitted. There is also a "One Strike" policy in place that is
   designed to quickly remove residents who get arrested as a result of
   criminal activity. Resident Councils are active at each of these sites,
   with three having active Safety and Security Committees. As a result,
   crime in each of our Public Housing sites has decreased over the last
   several years. While our two largest family sites have a history of
   being dangerous and crime-filled places, they are, in reality, among
   the safest and most crime-free areas of the City.

   All of our sites are located close to public transportation. Ranges and
   refrigerators are provided at each of the units of Public Housing.
   Laundry facilities are available in four of the seven sites. Rent rates
   for Public Housing are on a sliding scale and is targeted to not exceed
   30 per cent of a person's income.
