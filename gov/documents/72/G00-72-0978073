                   THE NORTH AMERICAN BIRD BANDING PROGRAM

   Bird banding is a universal and indispensable technique for studying
   the movement, survival and behavior of birds. The North American Bird
   Banding Program is jointly administered by the United States Department
   of the Interior and the Canadian Wildlife Service . Their respective
   banding offices have similar functions and policies and use the same
   bands, reporting forms and data formats. Joint coordination of the
   program dates back to 1923.

   Bird banding is one of the most useful tools in the modern study of
   wild birds. Wild birds are captured and marked with a uniquely numbered
   band or ring placed on the leg. The bander records where and when each
   bird is banded, how old it is, what sex it is, and any other
   information and sends those data to the Bird Banding Laboratory.
   Information from bands subsequently found and reported to the Bird
   Banding Laboratory provides data on the distribution and movements of
   species, their relative numbers, annual production, life-span and
   causes of death. Such information increases our knowledge and
   understanding of birds and their habits and assists us in their
   management and conservation.

   The Bird Banding Laboratory issues permits that allow people and
   organizations to band birds. The Bird Banding Laboratory also issues
   bands to banders in the United States and maintains the data collected
   by banders. Some researchers request special authorizations to use
   markers that allow an individual bird to be identified at a distance or
   tracked using radio transmitters. The Bird Banding Laboratory does not
   actually band birds. Instead, the Bird Banding Laboratory issues the
   permits, provides the bands, and coordinates the marking projects in
   the United States.

   The Bird Banding Program supports the work of federal and state
   conservation agencies, the academic community, professional and amateur
   ornithologists, nongovernmental organizations, and businesses. These
   banders are involved in promulgating hunting regulations, monitoring
   bird populations, restoring endangered species, studying effects of
   environmental contaminants, studying bird behavior and ecology, and
   addressing issues of human health, safety and economy that involve
   birds.

   The Bird Banding Laboratory is currently undergoing a massive
   re-engineering. Click here to learn more about the re-engineering.
