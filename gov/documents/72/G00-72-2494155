   Focus on Safety-Integrated Safety Management (ISM) in CMS

   Chemistry and Materials Science (CMS) is committeed to meeting our
   programmatic goals and customer needs, yet doing so only if it can be
   done safely.  Our committment to safety is embedded in all aspects of
   our work planning and execution, from managing our multi-programmatic
   research facilities, to individual research projects.  Our committment
   to safety extends through all work performed both on- and off-site and
   especially to our visitors, students, and guests.

   To achieve our commitment to safety, we manage all of our research and
   work under the auspices of our Integrated Safety Management System
   (ISMS).  Integrated Safety Management (ISM) is a mangement system used
   by all contractors of the U.S. Departement of Energy (DOE).  It is
   built on Five Core Functions and Seven Guiding Principles and is
   underlain by our own Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)
   Fundamental Guiding Principle. The management system ensures that all
   research and work activities receive a thorough evaluation from our
   environment, safety, and health (ES&H) experts and that ES&H is
   fundamentally ingegrated with the budgeting, planning, and execution of
   the research or work activity.

   If you work with our CMS personnel, you may want to become familiar
   with the basic concepts of our ISMS and our work planning and execution
   process.  For more information, visit the following sites:

       Worker Responsibilities, and Integrated Safety Managment"
