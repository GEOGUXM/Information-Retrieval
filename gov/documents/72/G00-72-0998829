                       Fall TarantulaFest and Barbecue
                         Saturday, October 5rd, 2002
                           10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.


   A male tarantula on his autumn rounds   Come to the fifth annual Coe
   Park TarantulaFest and rub elbows (so to speak) with some of our fuzzy,
   friendly eight-legged guests of honor.  The event is held at the
   headquarters campground, which has breathtaking views across the ridges
   and canyons of the backcountry.

   The day will be filled with games, contests, entertainment, and
   enlightenment.  And don't worry if you're arachnophobic.  Several
   tarantulas will be invited to the event, but they're going to stay in
   peripheral areas where people can come to visit them.

   If you buy a meal ticket in advance, you can sit down and enjoy great
   home-cooked food at our all-you-can-eat barbecue.

     Go on a leisurely nature walk with a volunteer naturalist and search
     for tarantulas on the move

     TarantulaFest photographers
