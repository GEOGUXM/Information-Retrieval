                    The Great and Little Miami River Basins

   In 1991, the U.S. Geological Survey began the National Water-Quality
   Assessment (NAWQA) Program. The long-term goals of the NAWQA Program
   are to describe the status and trends in the water-quality of a large,
   representative part of the Nation's surface- and ground-water resources
   and to provide a sound scientific understanding of the primary natural
   and human factors affecting the quality of these resources.

   The Great and Little Miami River Basins is one of more than 50 major
   river and aquifer systems-termed "study units" chosen by the NAWQA
   Program to represent the diverse geography, water resources, and land
   and water uses in the Nation. The Great and Little Miami River Basins
   (MIAM) study unit is one of the NAWQA studies that began in 1997.
   Initial collection of water-quality and ecological data began in
   September 1998.
