Processing Overview

   Data are processed by both the Goddard Distributed Active Archive
   Center (Goddard DAAC) and the MODIS Adaptive Processing Sytem (MODAPS).
   Processing occurs in stages, producing different levels of processed
   data.

   Upon receipt of the instrument data (Level 0), the Goddard DAAC
   produces radiance counts (Level 1A) and calibrated, geolocated radiance
   data (Level 1B). This processing includes computation of the
   geolocation information, atmospheric profiles, and cloud mask.

   The Level 1B calibrated, geolocated radiance data is then sent to
   MODAPS where the local granule (Level 2) and global (Level 3) data
   products are generated. The Level 2 and 3 products are then sent back
   to the Goddard DAAC, where all Level 1 (A & B), atmospheric data, and
   ocean data are archived.

   To obtain data products, contact the Goddard DAAC.
