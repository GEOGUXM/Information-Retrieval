     The Energetics and Dynamics of the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere:
     TIMED/CEDAR Collaborative Studies Program

     Letters announcing the final selection of awards for the Energetics and
     Dynamics of the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere: TIMED/CEDAR
     Collaborative Studies Program were mailed to Principal Investigators on
     June 6, 2000.

     These awards were made on the basis of proposals submitted in response
     to NASA Research Announcement (NRA)-99-OSS-01. Proposals describing 37
     investigations were reviewed in the competition for funding for this
     program. Eleven of these were rated Excellent or Excellent/Very Good in
     a peer review of their scientific merit, 15 were rated Very Good or
     Very Good/Good, and the remainder were rated Good or less. The funding
     available for the support of this program allowed the selection of 14
     of these proposals for funding.

     The scientific merit of the proposals was evaluated by expert mail-in
     reviewers and a panel of knowledgeable scientists. The assignment of
     ratings was based on requirements set out in the NRA and followed
     carefully the definitions of Excellent, Very Good, Good, and Poor which
     were provided to proposers. As is the general case, in order for a
     proposal to be have been rated Very Good or Excellent it had to have
     (1) presented a clear scientific question to be answered, (2) outlined
     an appropriate and feasible method of approaching this question and (3)
     provided confidence that if the proposed effort were carried out, then
     definitive progress in understanding the phenomenon in question would
     likely result. The selection was based on a combination of scientific
     and programmatic grounds, and was strongly influenced by the degree to
     which the proposals met the NRA requirement to demonstrate that they
     demonstrate the importance of their proposed efforts to the science
     goals of both the TIMED and CEDAR programs. A list of the selected
     investigations follows; a file containing the abstracts of these
     investigations can be found at

     1. New Solicitation for NASA Sun-Earth Connection Proposals

     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     ------------------------------

     From: George Withbroe gwithbro@hq.nasa.gov

     A solicitation for proposals to a new NASA program element, the Living
     With a Star (LWS) program, was issued May 10, 2000, as an amendment to
     the NASA Research Announcement for Research Opportunities in Space
     Science - 2000 (ROSS-2000) (NRA 00-OSS-01). The goal of the LWS program
     is to develop the scientific understanding necessary to effectively
     address those elements of the connected Sun-Earth system that affect
     life and society. The NRA amendment solicits proposals to exploit data
     from past and present space missions for scientific analysis, theory,
     and modeling efforts that lead to operational answers concerning
     specific areas relevant to societal needs. Community members who are
     considering proposing to either LWS or the standard Sun-Earth
     Connections programs advertised in the initial version of ROSS-2000
     should take into account the differences between the two programs,
     which is primarily in their goals rather than the types of activities
     that will be supported: the standard research program has as its main
     goal increasing our basic understanding of the Sun-Earth connected
     system while the LWS program is specifically focused on the development
     of the scientific understanding necessary to effectively address those
     particular aspects of the system that directly affect life and society.

     Descriptions of both programs are available on the World Wide Web at
     http://spacescience.nasa.gov/nra/00-oss-01/, with the standard program
     being described in the main body of the NRA and the LWS description
     appearing in the section "Amendments." Note that proposals for the LWS
     program are due September 7, 2000.

     Graduate Student Research Program (GSRP) 2000 Selection Announced

     Letters announcing the results of the 2000 Graduate Student Research
     Program competition were mailed on March 30, 2000. Thirteen of this
     year's GSRP proposals were referred to the Sun-Earth Connection (SEC)
     for review. Three of these proposals were selected for funding, two to
     be supported by the GSRP program itself, one to be supported from SEC
     program funds.

     Competition for GSRP slots is always strong; this year the entire
     Office of Space Science was allotted 23 awards to be selected from
     among 156 proposals. The high degree of competition means that selected
     proposals have to meet strict requirements: when there are so few
     awards to be made we select the students who appear to have the best
     chance of completing a distinguished thesis within the three year
     period supported by the fellowship.

     - It has been our experience, for instance, that students who have not
     yet finished their undergraduate studies have seldom had sufficient
     experience in the field for them to be prepared to conceptualize and
     carry out a well thought out thesis in such a relatively short time.

     - Proposals based on data which has not yet been obtained are at a
     disadvantage in this process because of the unavoidable uncertainty in
     whether or not it will be possible to carry out the proposed project.

     Another thing to note is that GSRP proposals that received a Superior
     rating met the general criteria that we have established for excellent
     proposals: that is, they presented

     (1) a clear description of a specific IMPORTANT scientific question to
     be pursued,

     (2) a cogent description of how the investigation was to be carried out

     (3) discussion of how the proposed effort would contribute to the
     resolution of the target problem, and

     (4) demonstration of the relevance of the proposed effort to the NASA
     program.

     Congratulations to the new SEC Graduate Student Researchers: James
     Crumley of the University of Minnesota; Lars Dyrud of Boston
     University; and Douglas Rowland of the University of Minnesota. Matthew
     Hill of the University of Maryland and Wayne Keith of Rice University
     received Honorable Mentions in this competition.

     FY 2000 Geospace Science SR&T Program

     The Geospace Science Supporting Research and Technology (SR&T) program
     is a new SR&T cluster that combines the previously separate
     Ionospheric, Thermospheric, and Mesospheric (ITM) Physics SR&T program,
     Magnetospheric Physics SR&T program, and Suborbital Program in
     Magnetospheric, Ionospheric, Thermospheric, and Mesospheric Physics. At
     the time that the call for proposals for new FY 2000 funding (Research
     Opportunities in Space Science  1999 (ROSS-99) NASA Research
     Announcement (NRA)) was issued, these were separate programs but they
     have since been consolidated and are now being managed as a single
     integrated program.

     A total of one hundred and seventy-seven investigation proposals were
     submitted to the various components of the Geospace Science SR&T
     program in response to ROSS-99. Under ordinary circumstances,
     approximately $5.5M of the total Geospace Science budget of $11.9M
     would have been available for the support of new programs in Fiscal
     Year (FY) 2000. However, because of liens imposed on the Office of
     Space Science (OSS) budget by various Congressional actions, the entire
     OSS SR&T budget suffered a 5.8% budget cut. It was an OSS policy
     decision that this cut should be uniformly applied, across both ongoing
     and new awards. In budgeting for this selection, all requests for new
     FY 2000 funding were thus cut by 5.8%. Taking this cut and other budget
     liens into account, the FY 2000 funding available to support new starts
     was $4.8M. The total FY 2000 funds requested by the submitted proposals
     was $18.9M and the program was, thus, as a whole, oversubscribed by a
     factor of about 4.

     The scientific merit of the proposals submitted to each of the three
     component programs was evaluated by expert mail-in reviewers and a
     panel of knowledgeable scientists. Proposal ratings was based on
     requirements set out in the NRA and followed carefully the NASA
     definitions of Excellent, Very Good, Good, and Poor, which were
     provided to proposers. Specifically, in order for a proposal to be have
     been rated Very Good or Excellent it had to have (1) presented a clear
     scientific question to be answered, (2) outlined an appropriate and
     feasible method of approaching this question and (3) provided
     confidence that if the proposed effort were carried out, then
     definitive progress in understanding the phenomenon in question would
     likely result. A proposal was classified as Excellent if and only if,
     having met these necessary but not sufficient conditions, it also
     targeted a compelling question whose timely solution was important to
     advancement of the field.

     In the review of their scientific merit, 47 of the submitted proposals
     were rated Excellent or Excellent/Very Good, another 65 rated Very Good
     or Very Good/Good, and the remainder rated Good or Poor. The
     competitive range for this selection was defined so as to include all
     of the Excellent, Excellent/Very Good, and Very Good proposals (a total
     of 66 proposals). The funding available for the support of new programs
     allowed the selection of 50 of these proposals for funding. The
     selection was based on a combination of scientific and programmatic
     grounds. A file cataloging all of the investigations that are being
     funded by the Geospace Science SR&T program in FY 2000, including the
     new selections, can be found at
     http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/oss/codesr/results.html.

     The next opportunity to propose for Geospace Science SR&T funding is in
     response to the Research Opportunities in Space Science - 2000
     (ROSS-00) NRA, which was released February 9, 2000.. This NRA is
     available at http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/oss/research/open.htm.

     NASA Selects Instruments for STEREO Mission

     NASAs Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission will
     use two identically equipped spacecraft to provide revolutionary 3-D
     imaging of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Investigations for STEREO
     will include:

     Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI)
     for the remote sensing package. SECCHI will have four instruments: an
     Extreme Ultraviolet Imager, two white-light coronagraphs and a
     Heliospheric Imager. These instruments will study the 3-D evolution of
     CMEs from birth at the Suns surface through the corona and
     interplanetary medium to its eventual impact at Earth. Dr. Russell
     Howard, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C., will lead the
     investigation.

     STEREO/WAVES (SWAVES) is an interplanetary radio burst tracker that
     will trace the generation and evolution of traveling radio disturbances
     from the Sun to the orbit of Earth. Dr. Jean Louis H. Bougeret, Centre
     National de la Recherche Scientifique, Observatory of Paris, and lead
     co-investigator Dr. Michael Kaiser of Goddard, will lead the
     investigation.

     In situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients (IMPACT)
     investigation will sample the 3-D distribution and provide plasma
     characteristics of solar energetic particles and the local vector
     magnetic field. Dr. Janet G. Luhmann, University of California,
     Berkeley, will lead this investigation.

     PLAsma and SupraThermal Ion and Composition (PLASTIC) experiment will
     provide plasma characteristics of protons, alpha particles and heavy
     ions. This experiment will provide key diagnostic measurements of the
     form of mass and charge state composition of heavy ions and
     characterize the CME plasma from ambient coronal plasma. Dr. Antoinette
     Galvin, University of New Hampshire, will lead this investigation.

     Spacecraft development is scheduled to begin in 2001, with launch
     scheduled for 2004.

     1st Gossamer Spacecraft Initiative Workshop

     Held October 12-13 1999. The Gossamer Spacecraft Initiative is a new
     NASA program to begin long-range development of enabling technologies
     for very large, ultra-lightweight structures and apertures. Gossamer
     spacecraft technology will allow NASA to undertake bold new missions of
     discovery such as searching for the signs of life on planets orbiting
     nearby stars, and sailing through space on beams of light even beyond
     our solar system. Concepts for gossamer spacecraft include giant
     telescopes and antennas, solar sails, and highly-integrated membrane
     spacecraft.
