   From this page, you can search all files at the site that are coded in
   the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). You may search the "Entire NRC
   Website," or a specific collection listed on the drop-down menu. In
   addition, you will find a search tool on each collection page at our
   Electronic Reading Room.

   Use the following steps to search our site:
    1. Enter the word or phrase ("search query") you are seeking.
    2. Select the collection of documents from the drop-down menu.
    3. Press the Search button and Select a document from the list
       matching your search query.

   Note: To search the comprehensive collection of public documents that
   reside in the agency's document retrieval system (ADAMS), see our ADAMS
   page.

Search Principles

   The search engine will search the site for files containing your search
   query using the following general principles:
     * The search engine ignores whether letters are upper or lower case.
     * The search engine searches the full-text of all documents in a
       collection unless you specifically limit your search as described
       in Help With Searching.
     * If your search query includes more than one word, the search engine
       will find all documents that contain all of the words in your
       search query in order.
     * Each word in the query will be stemmed, as applicable.
     * The search engine sorts matching files by relevancy, so documents
       at the top of the list will contain more and better matches than
       those lower in the list.

Special Characters

   If you wish to exercize greater control over the results of your
   search, you may use special characters such as--
   Character                               Purpose
   ( ) or " " Use parentheses or quotation marks to enclose a word or
              phrase that you want to find exactly as entered
       *      Use an asterisk to represent any number of unknown characters. For
              example, steam* will match any word beginning with the characters
              steam.
       ?      Use a question mark to represent a single unknown character. For
              example, steam? will match any 6-letter word beginning with the
              characters s t e a m.
      and     Use and between words if you want to find documents that contain
              both words but not one or the other by itself
