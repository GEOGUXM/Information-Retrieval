   Two programs develop Productivity and Costs data for elements of the
   U.S. economy. The major sector Productivity and Costs program produces
   quarterly and annual output per hour and unit labor costs for the U.S.
   business, nonfarm business, and manufacturing sectors. These are the
   productivity statistics most often cited by the national media.

   The Industry Productivity program publishes annual measures for output
   per hour and unit labor costs for over 500 3- and 4-digit Standard
   Industrial Classification (SIC) industries in the U.S., featuring
   complete coverage in manufacturing and in retail trade, as well as some
   coverage in other sectors. BLS maintains and makes available, upon
   request, unpublished labor productivity measures for over 200
   additional industries.
