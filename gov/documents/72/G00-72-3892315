   Administration In 1999, 475,000 large trucks (gross vehicle weight
   rating greater than 10,000 pounds) were involved in traffic crashes in
   the United States; 4,898 were involved in fatal crashes. A total of
   5,362 people died (13 percent of all the traffic fatalities reported in
   1999) and an additional 142,000 were injured in those crashes. Large
   trucks accounted for 3 percent of all registered vehicles, 7 percent of
   total vehicle miles traveled, 9 percent of all vehicles involved in
   fatal crashes, and 4 percent of all vehicles involved in injury and
   property-damage-only crashes in 1998 (1999 registered vehicle and
   vehicle miles traveled data not available). One out of eight traffic
   fatalities in 1999 resulted from a collision involving a large truck.

   the fatalities that resulted from crashes involving large trucks, 78
   percent were occupants of another vehicle, 8 percent were nonoccupants,
   and 14 percent were occupants of a large truck. Of the injuries that
   resulted from crashes involving large trucks, 74 percent were occupants
   of another vehicle, 3 percent were nonoccupants, and 23 percent were
   occupants of a large truck. Table 2. Fatalities and Injuries in Crashes

   more likely to be involved in a fatal multiple-vehicle crash - as
   opposed to a fatal single-vehicle crash - than were passenger vehicles
   (84 percent of all large trucks involved in fatal crashes, compared
   with 62 percent of all passenger vehicles). In 29 percent of the
   two-vehicle fatal crashes involving a large truck and another type of
   vehicle, both vehicles were impacted in the front. The truck was struck
   in the rear more than twice as often as the other vehicle (17 percent
   and 7 percent, respectively). Table 3. Principal Impact Points in

   Facts 1999 - Large Trucks 3 In almost half (48 percent) of the
   two-vehicle fatal crashes involving a large truck and another type of
   vehicle, both vehicles were proceeding straight at the time of the
   crash. In 10 percent of the crashes, the other vehicle was turning. In
   9 percent, either the truck or the other vehicle was negotiating a
   curve. In 7 percent, either the truck or the other vehicle was stopped
   or parked in a traffic lane (5 percent and 2 percent, respectively).
   Most of the fatal crashes involving large trucks occurred in rural
   areas (68 percent), during the daytime (67 percent), and on weekdays
   (79 percent). During the week, 74 percent of the crashes occurred
   during the daytime (6:00 AM to 5:59 PM). On weekends, 62 percent
   occurred at night (6:00 PM to 5:59 AM). The percentage of large truck
   drivers involved in fatal crashes who were intoxicated - with blood
   alcohol concentrations (BAC) of 0.10 grams per deciliter (g/dl) or
   greater - was 1 percent in 1999. Intoxication rates for drivers of
   other types of vehicles involved in fatal crashes in 1999 were 17
   percent for passenger cars, 20 percent for light trucks, and 28 percent
   for motorcycles. "The intoxication rate for drivers of large trucks
   involved in fatal Figure 1. Estimated Proportions of Drivers in Fatal

   Facts 1999 - Large Trucks 4 Drivers of large trucks were less likely to
   have a previous license suspension or revocation than were passenger
   car drivers (9 percent and 13 percent, respectively). Almost 30 percent
   of all large truck drivers involved in fatal crashes in 1999 had at
   least one prior speeding conviction, compared to just under 20 percent
   of the passenger car drivers involved in fatal crashes. Figure 2.
