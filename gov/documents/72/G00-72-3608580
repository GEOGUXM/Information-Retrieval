   Spanish name: Abejas

   Description: Bees comprise a highly diverse group of hymenopterous
   insects in the Sonoran Desert region. Superficially, bees resemble some
   wasps, especially the parasitic "cuckoo" bees, except that they are
   usually more robust, hairier and posess specialized structures for
   carrying pollen back to their nests. The ants, bees and wasps form a
   natural group referred to by taxonomists as the aculeate "stinging"
   hymenoptera because of the aculeus or stinger. Only females sting since
   the aculeus evolved from the ovipositor or egg-laying tube. The figure
   below depicts a small portion of the biodiversity of bees living within
   the Sonoran Desert. Sonoran bees range in size from the world's
   smallest bee (Perdita minima, at less than 2 mm) to carpenter bees (the
   genus Xylocopa), gentle giants which may have body lengths of almost 40
   mm and weigh over a gram. Our native bees burrow into the ground or
   create nests inside hollow/pithy dried stems or abandoned tunnels left
   by wood-boring beetles. With the exception of parasitic forms,
   parasitic on other bees, all bees are herbivorous feeding upon pollen,
   nectar and oils offered as floral rewards by flowering plants. Most
   bees have solitary lifestyles in which females act alone to construct
   and provision nests, to forms like the familiar black and yellow
   bumblebees, highly social forms with a colony headed by a queen and
   comprised of her sterile daughters and a few males. The familar honey
   bee (Apis mellifera) is an exotic organism introduced into the United
   States about 350 years ago by the English colonists.

   Distribution: There are at least 45 genera in 7 - 8 families, and
   perhaps as many as 1,000 species of bees distributed within the Sonoran
   desert bioregion. Our deserts are especially rich in native ground and
   twig-nesting bees. Unlike most organisms, bees are most speciose and
   abundant in deserts and savannahs, not in lowland rainforests. Perhaps
   this is the case since the vast majority are soil nesters whose nest
   provisions and larvae could be at risk by nesting in water-logged
   soils. The region around Tucson, AZ is thought to host more kinds of
   bees than anywhere else in the world, except perhaps some deserts in
   Israel. In the United States, there are about 5,000 species of bees. On
   a global scale, there are approximately 25,000 named species, but
   perhaps as many as 40,000 different species.

   Ecology: Bees comprise a highly successful monophyletic group derived
   from wasps and live in almost all terrestrial habitats within our
   region. Except for the parasitic "cuckoo" bees, all female bees make
   their living by foraging at some distance from the nest in search of
   protein-rich pollen and sugary nectar from flowering plants. By moving
   pollen around from flower to flower and plant to plant, bees perform
   vital and often unappreciated roles as the most important group of
   pollinating animals on earth. Most plants do not self-pollinate or
   benefit from the cross pollination with unrelated individuals that
   comes about through the foraging activities of bees. The bees are not
   out to "help" flowers by pollinating, but collect pollen and nectar to
   feed themselves and their larvae. Pollination is the transfer of pollen
   grains from anthers to a receptive female stigma. Bees are the animal
   vectors that efficiently move the pollen within and between individuals
   of the same species.

   The vital roles that bees play in Sonoran Desert ecoysystems can be
   understood by thinking about what life would be like without them. Of
   the 660 flowering plant species growing in the Tucson Mountains near
   the Desert Museum, likely 80% of these species have flowers adapted for
   and pollinated by bees. Similarly, at least 30% of our agricultural
   crops require the movement of pollen between flowers mediated by bees.
   Not only are we dependent upon these "forgotten pollinators" for most
   of what we eat, but other products as well. The fibers of cotton and
   flax woven into textiles are the result of pollination by bees along
   with some beverages (like apple and cranberry juice) and medicines made
   from fruits and seeds.

   Bees are "keystone mutualists" since without the pollination services
   they provide, many dominant plants within desert communities would not
   produce seed-laden fruits from which the next generation of plants
   would grow. Without the diverse assemblage of native bees living in our
   deserts, most of these plant and animal communities would collapse into
   a simpler assemblage of wind-pollinated species, with few or no fleshy
   berries and other fruits to sustain birds, mammals, lizards and other
   wildlife. Bees perform other vital ecological roles in addition to
   pollination. Most bees are ground-nesters so their tunneling activity
   aerates the soil and allows water from infrequent rains to quickly
   penetrate and reach plant roots. In addition to this bioturbation,
   their nitrogen-rich feces serve to fertilize the soil. The bees
   themselves, often provide nutritious food for other animals including
   lizards, mammals, birds, other insects, spiders and other arachnids.

   In their daily searches for pollen and nectar from flowering desert
   annual wildflowers or perennials, bees harvest great quantities of
   these floral rewards as food for themselves and their larvae. The
   pollen contains the plant gametes but are a rich food source of amino
   acids, proteins, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, sterols and
   carbohydrates for bees. Pollen is the nitrogen-rich food that bees must
   have to grow, maintain their bodies and to produce young. Nectar, is
   the watery solution of sucros, glucose, fructose, and amino acids which
   provides the energy boost that bees need to fly, you can think of it as
   their flight fuel or soda pop. Some desert bees (e.g. the anthophorid
   genus Centris) has specialized scrapers on its legs which allow females
   to harvest oils from glands on the undersides of flowers within the
   families Krameriaceae and Malpighiaceae. These energy-rich floral oils
   are used to help construct their underground cells and mixed with
   pollen to feed their growing larvae. Other bees collect small pebbles,
   plant trichomes or harvest floral resins, saps and gums which they use
   as building materials in their nest and cell construction. Many bees
   also seek out sources of water or mud, such as the Mason bees in the
   genus Osmia, from which to fashion their adobe-like nests. Circular
   pieces from leaf margins, are removed by leafcutter bees--especially
   the genus Megachile-- and fashioned into the walls of their nest cells.

   Many bees can be considered specialists since they visit the flowers of
   only one kind or a few related wildflowers. These bees are only active
   for a few weeks or months out of the year and their annual emergence is
   perfectly timed to conincide with the bloom of their wildflower host
   plants. One type of specialist bee is the genus Protandrena which only
   visits the purple blossoms of silverleaf nightshade (Solanum
   eleagnifolium) to sonically extract the pollen from its enlarged
   anthers in what is known as buzz pollination. Other bees, are
   generalists and collect pollen and nectar from a wide variety of
   unrelated plants. Examples of desert generalist bees are the familiar
   Sonoran bumblebee (Bombus sonorus) or our giant carpenter bees
   (Xylocopa spp.) which visit many different plants including legumes and
   sunflowers.

   Life History: The vast majority of desert bees dig nests in the ground
   with their cells just a few inches deep or 6 feet or more down into
   sandy soils. Many species line their burrows or cells with waxy
   secretions produced by glands within their abdomens which waterproof
   the cells, maintain humidity and keep spoilage organisms like fungi
   from destroying the food and developing larvae. Most bees are solitary,
   i.e. each female selects a site for her nest, excavates the tunnels,
   forms and provisions the rounded "cells" and lays an egg within each
   one. This behavior is called "mass provisioning" since the mother bee
   collects and prepares all the pollen and nectar food the developing bee
   larva will need to pass through usually five instars from the egg to
   larva then pupa and finally a complete metamorphosis into the newly
   emerged adult. After laying her egg in each cell, the solitary female
   has no further contact with her progeny. Although solitary, many of our
   Sonoran desert bees routinely nest in very large aggregated nest sites
   of gregarious females. An example of this behavior is seen in our
   common "cactus bee" (Diadasia rinconis) which pollinates prickly pear,
   cholla and saguaro cacti. Its nest aggregations during the spring
   cactus bloom may number in the hundreds of thousands over an area the
   size of two or three tennis courts.

   Other native desert bees don't go to the bother of excavating their own
   nests. Instead, they actively search out the abandoed exit holes and
   tunnels of wood-boring beetles (usally buprestids and cerambycids) in
   dead limbs or standing dead trees. These bees are known by their common
   names of leafcutter (the genera Chalicodoma and Megachile) and mason
   bees (the genus Osmia). Once a beetle burrow is located, these females
   bring back cut pieces of leaves, resins and pebbles or mud balls with
   with to fashion their cells and the thick protective capping plugs.

   Most of our Sonoran desert bees have one generation per year
   (univoltine) and this usually occurs with the spring or summer
   wildflower blooms. Some species, however, have two or even three
   generations per year. A typical life history involves adult males and
   females mating soon upon emergence from their natal cells, nest
   contstruction and provisioning by the females with the larvae
   developing rapidly underground. Usually, the larvae hold over in a
   resting diapause condition at the prepupal or pharate adult stage until
   the following spring or summer when the complete the metamorphosis and
   emerge as adults.

   Social Behavior: A relatively small number of our desert bees are truly
   social. Bee sociality indicates that these species have departed along
   their evolutionary path from their solitary ancestors. In the case of
   some sweat bees (the family Halictidae), a "queen" which looks like
   other females in the colony except that she contains highly developed
   ovaries. She may or may not secrete "pheromones" which elicit feeding
   and grooming behavior in her daughters. The queen does all the
   egg-laying within the colony. For sweat bees, the colonies are usually
   small, consisting of a few dozen or at most a few hundred individuals.

   Highly social bees in our region include the introduced honey bee and
   the native large black and yellow bumblebees in the genus Bombus. These
   colonies are annual in nature, founded by an overwintered and already
   inseminated queen who searches out a suitable mouse nest or other
   underground cavity in which to nest. The queen is larger than her
   daughters and performs all the egg-laying after she has produced a
   first small brood of workers. Males and queens are produced late in the
   season and colony cycle. They mate, the males die and the inseminated
   queens spend the fall and winter "hibernating" below ground until the
   next spring.

   Farther south in Sonora, Mexico (e.g. near Alamos) are extremely social
   bees living in colonies with many thousands of individuals. These are
   nests of the so-called "stingless bees", the genera Melipona and
   Trigona. These queens are physogastric with abdomens swollen full of
   eggs. They are not able to fly once they begin egg-laying and never
   leave the colony again. Thus, these social bees represent a greater
   caste differentiation between queens and workers. They store up several
   liters of honey in waxen storage pots that look like clusters of
   grapes. Within Sonoran, indigenous peoples sometimes find these nests
   within hollow trees then transport the hives back to their villages
   where they tend the stingless bees and routinely harvest their honey
   and beeswax.

   Conservation: Some of our native desert bees are endangered by the
   habitat-framenting activities of humans as we build homes, shopping
   malls and cultivate agricultural lands that were formely desert
   wildlands. Since many bees nest shallowly, their nests are disturbed or
   destroyed by these activities. Garden and agricultural pesticides take
   a further toll on these flower-visiting insects when used improperly or
   at the wrong time of day. Never apply pesticides to blooming plants so
   that you can avoid killing off your essential pollinators. After many
   of our desert legume trees die, they have not outlived their usefulness
   in nature. Dead mesquite (Prosopis) and palo verde (Cercidium) trees,
   or dead limbs, provide ideal habitats for wood-boring beetle larvae.
   Once abandoned, these holes and tunnels become the next neighborhood
   for a rich variety of desert bees.

   You can become a bee rancher by doing a few simple things in your
   backyard or garden and help restore native bee populations to our urban
   desert landscapes. Help your children design and build "bee condos",
   small nesting sites for native bees made from drilled wooden blocks or
   paper/plastic soda straws inserted into a tin can or paper milk carton.
   With some scrap lumber, drill holes (1/8 to 5/16 inch diameter (7 - 8
   mm) and 3 to 6 inches deep) into some scrap lumber. Don't drill all the
   way through the block and don't drill holes too close to the edges.
   Nail or hang these nesting blocks up on a tree or under the eaves of
   your house or garden shed in the early spring. Nesting femal leafcutter
   and mason bees (like the Orchard Mason Bee) will find your "bee condos"
   and take up residence. These new tenants willl provide you not only
   with many hours of fascinating entertainment, but you can reap the
   delicious bounty of apples, apricots, peaches and other fruits trees
   and vegetables. Give bees a chance!
