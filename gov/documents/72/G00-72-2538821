                   JPL's Image Processing Laboratory History

  Image Processing Laboratory 1966-1984

   The image processing laboratory (IPL) at NASA's Jet Propulsion
   Laboratory began in 1966 to retrieve and process video images from
   spacecraft. Software called VICAR (Video Image Communication And
   Retrieval) was developed to process the images on an IBM 360 computer.
   VICAR was written by Howard Frieden, Bob Nathan, Stan Bressler, John
   Campbell, Tom King and Ed Efron. This was a batch oriented system with
   data input from magnetic tape, command input from punched cards and
   output to magnetic tape. Images were displayed on a video film
   converter which was built by LINC.

   In the mid-1970s, time sharing was introduced into the IPL when IBM TSO
   was released. In the late-1970s, PDP-11 peripheral processors were
   added to manage image displays. The VICAR algorithms continued to be
   developed and improved.

   This phase of the IPL supported the following flight projects:
     * Ranger
     * Surveyor
     * Mariner 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10
     * Viking
     * Voyager(Jupiter and Saturn)

   In 1979, IPL merged with MTIS and continued to support real-time and
   systematic production for Voyager.

  Multimission Image Processing Laboratory 1984-1995

   In 1984, the Multimission Image Processing Laboratory (MIPL) was
   formed. New hardware was acquired in the form of Digital Equipment
   Corporation VAX 11/780s. VICAR programs were ported to run under the
   Transportable Applications Executive (TAE). The new facility provided
   for batch or interactive processing. The hardware consisted of multiple
   VAX computers clustered with a common disk system, line and page
   oriented video terminals (VT100), image display hardware (by Gould,
   Adage and Ramtek), film recorders and hardcopy printers, disk (magnetic
   and optical) and tape (reel and cassette) archives, and network
   connections to the "outside world".

   This phase has supported the following flight projects:
     * SIR-C
     * Voyager (Uranus and Neptune)
     * Magellan
     * Galileo cruise

   On September 28, 1995, the Multimission Image Processing Laboratory was
   decommissioned.

  Multimission Image Processing System - 1995 and beyond

   The new Multimission Image Processing Subsystem is a distributed system
   with Digital Alpha and Sun servers and multiple Sun, SGI and HP
   workstations. The VICAR image processing subsystem has been ported to
   all of the platforms and maintains its TAE command line interface as
   well as a new GUI based interface. Film recorders and hardcopy devices
   are available to all the workstations on the network. The files will be
   centrally stored on a storage server consisting of high speed magnetic
   disk and archives on CD-ROM and magnetic tape cassettes. MIPS supports
   the following missions:
     * Galileo
     * Cassini
     * Mars Pathfinder
     * Mars 98
     * Voyager

   and supports the following projects:
     * Solar System Visualization
     * Kidsat
     * NEAT
