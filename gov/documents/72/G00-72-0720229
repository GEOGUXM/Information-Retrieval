   Department of Energy Solicits Recommendations for Microbial Sequencing
   Targets

   The DoE is seeking nominations of microbes and microbial communities as
   candidates for draft genomic sequencing in support of the DoE's
   Microbial Genome and the Genomes to Life Programs. Candidate microbes
   and microbial communities should be relevant to DOE mission needs,
   e.g., microbes involved in environmental processes, waste remediation,
   carbon management, energy production, and/or biodefense. The genomes of
   selected microbes/communities will be draft sequenced (6-8 X coverage)
   by the Doe's Joint Genome Institute. (Nomination deadline: March 28,
   2002).
