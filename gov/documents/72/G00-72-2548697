   Daily, real-time runs of the Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) are
   being produced at NSSL on an SGI Power Challenge workstation. The model
   domain and resolution are very similar to those of our Eta model Output
   .

   As with our local Eta model runs, initial and boundary conditions are
   obtained from interpolation of the routinely available 80km/38layer Eta
   Model fields obtained from EMC/NCEP.

   This version of MM5 and NSSL's Realtime runs of the 32km Eta all use
   the same version of the Kain-Fritsch convective parameterization. Once
   these MM5 runs are stabilized, we will begin to compile verification
   statisitics to compare the performance of these very similarly
   configured version of the Eta and MM5 models.

   We share this busy workstation with daily runs of the MM5 including
   short range ensembles. Check out those pages also.
