                          THE CLAY MINERALS SOCIETY

                            SOURCE CLAYS PROJECT

   By the early 1970's the need for sources of homogeneous clay samples
   had become apparent to researchers. Natural deposits are so variable
   that data generated by different investigators working at the same
   outcrop often cannot be compared with confidence. Thus the Clay
   Minerals Society set up the Source Clays Project.

   The Society's Source Clay Repository offers two series of materials,
   the Source Clays and the Special Clays.

   The Source Clays are derived from large, reasonably homogenized stocks.
   Thus, over the years, data on these reference materials can be
   compared. The samples have been carefully selected from the source
   deposits by professionals to minimize in situ variations. Because any
   beneficiation technique can bring about changes in properties,
   pre-treatment usually involves only low-temperature, steam-fired tray
   drying, and imp or Raymond mill pulverization. Each original sample
   consisted of one metric ton.

   The Special Clays are rare but of great theoretical interest. No
   attempt has been made to homogenize or beneficiate them.

   Data on the CMS Source Clays are available in the October (2001) issue
   of
   Clays and Clay Minerals, Volume 49, Number 5, pages 371-453.

   Full information on most details of CMS Source Clays is now kept at the
   repository at the University of Missouri:

   http://web.missouri.edu/~geoscjy/SourceClay.

   A list of the available Source Clays can be found at:

   http://web.missouri.edu/~geoscjy/SourceClay/sourceclays.html.

   A list of the available Special Clays can be found at:

   A bibliography of literature pertaining to the source clays may be
   obtained from the Repository Web site:

  The following Source Clays are completely depleted.

    WE WOULD APPRECIATE KNOWING NEW SOURCES OR SUPPLIERS OF THE FOLLOWING
    MATERIALS:

     * CorWa-1 Corrensite, Packwood, Washington (Ohanapecosh Form.)
       Altered Eocene tuff, containing 25-50% corrensite; quartz and
       plagioclase impurities separable by wet sedimentation. Need new
       supplier.
     * NG-1 Nontronite, Hohen Hagen, Germany, Nontronite-cemented sand
       (15-20% nontronite), easily separated by wet sedimentation (Char.
       by Schneiderhoehn, Tschermaks Min. u. Pet. Mitt., 10, 385-399,
       1965). Need new supplier.
     * SepNev-1 Sepiolite, Two Crows, Nevada (pub. ref Clays and Clay
       Minerals, v. 26, p. 58-64, 1978). Need new supplier.
     * VTx-1 Vermiculite, Llano, Texas, USA, a mixture of magnesite,
       phlogopite, and vermiculite. The vermiculite can be separated by
       hand picking. Plans made to replace.

   The clays offered by the Source Clays Project change frequently because
   of new acquisitions and depletion of old supplies. The Source Clays
   Project is always grateful for new acquisitions, particularly of clays
   which have become depleted. If you are able to provide access to a new
   source of source or special clays, please contact the curator
