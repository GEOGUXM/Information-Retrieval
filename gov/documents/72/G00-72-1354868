   Accessibility
   The STAT-USA/Internet is designed to be accessible to people with
   disabilities through their use of assistive technology. Some of our
   documents were created in legacy versions of Adobe Acrobat (PDF files)
   and therefore cannot be read by assistive technology. Many documents
   received from other federal agencies, contain data tables that may
   produce inconsistent results when read by assistive technology.
   STAT-USA is working with its data suppliers to encourage the creation
   of this data in accessible formats.

   If you would like to receive an alternative version of any of our
   documents, please email us at statmail@mail.doc.gov or call STAT-USA's
   Customer Service Hotline at 1-800-STAT-USA (1-800-782-8872) or
   202-482-1986.
