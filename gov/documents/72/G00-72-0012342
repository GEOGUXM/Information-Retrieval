  Computer-Enhanced Science Education: The Whole Frog Project

   Computers can't teach everything in anatomy, but they can teach some
   things better, either by themselves or through synergy with
   conventional methods. Try out this award-winning virtual frog- as a
   case in point.
   Jump right into the Interactive Frog Dissection Kit. [Interact.gif]

     * Read an introductory lecture on the Whole Frog project that
       explains its pedagogical and technological basis, or a summary
       paper that emphasizes its Web aspects.

  Distributed, Collaboratory Experiment Environments

   The fusion of computers and electronic communications has the potential
   to dramatically enhance the output and productivity of U. S.
   researchers. A major step toward realizing that potential can come from
   combining the interests of the scientific community at large with those
   of the computer science and engineering community to create integrated,
   tool-oriented computing and communication systems to support scientific
   collaboration. Such systems can be called "collaboratories."
   From "National Collaboratories - Applying Information Technology for
   Scientific Research," Committee on a National Collaboratory, National
   Research Council. National Academy Press, Washington, D. C., 1993.
   The DCEE program has made several significant contributions to making
   this vision a reality. The draft final report of the DCEE program (now
   replaced by the DOE2000 program) is available at the DCEE hompage.

   The ALS, Spectro-microscopy Facility Collaboratory that we are most
   directly involved with is described at Beamline 7 Spectromicroscopy
   Collaboratory at the Advanced Light Source.

   The DCEE program helped to identify aspects of the collaboratory
   environment that needed further research and development. The DOE 2000
   program is funding research into these areas. The DOE 2000 projects
   that we are directly involved in are Electronic Notebooks,
   Collaboratory Software Bus and Distributed Security Architectures.

  Imaging Processing and Manipulation Systems

   Turning ideas like these into applications takes a good bit of
   programming, a situation that is not simplified by the need to
   accommodate many subtly different kinds of equipment. Accordingly, one
   of our ongoing efforts is the development of "middleware" that replaces
   numerous low-level operations with a few high-level function calls.
   These tools include:
     * Auto-Configuration System (ACS).
     * Complex Conversion System & Extended C Libraries (CCS-ECL).

   Page.

  High-Speed Networking Research

   It's practically a law of computing that users' and developers' dreams
   expand to fill the available bandwidth. Imaging, telepresence, and
   distributed computing applications are among the most demanding of all.
   Accordingly, we and some of our collaborators are deeply involved in
   state-of-the-art efforts to implement faster networks and use them
   efficiently. Some of these projects are:
     * The Distributed-Parallel Storage System (DPSS) / MAGIC Gigabit
       Testbed. [Interact.gif]
     * Bay Area Gigabit Testbed (BAGNet) home page

  Image and Document Management

   Today's powerful computers and high-speed networks enable people to
   create and transfer a daunting amount of data. Fortunately, these
   machines can also be used to manage, organize, and facilitate access to
   all this information. Among the possible approaches are image
   databases. You can try out a read-only version of LBNL's Image Library,
   see several examples of on-line papers that use images from the ImgLib

  Our vision...
       Powerful and versatile computing and information systems are
       becoming more widely available every day. Increasingly, their value
       will come from their connectivity and from users' ability to find
       and share resources over the networks. High performance has a
       synergistic effect when teamed with this connectivity. The ability
       to use high-speed networks to transparently provide distributed
       computing and collaboration depends on technology advances in
       several areas of software and hardware. Throughout the
       industrialized world, massive efforts are underway in government
       laboratories, universities, and corporations to help this field
       progress and reap its rewards.
       Our contributions center around experiments that are driven by
       imaging applications; strategic collaborations made possible or
       made better by networking; and high-speed distributed computing.
       The fields that benefit range from health care to the quest to
       develop fusion energy.

Research Collaboration Program

   This program of collaboration between LBNL and CNPq, Brazil was
   established via a Memorandum of Understanding signed February 20th 1996
   between Dr. Stewart Loken, ICSD, and Dr. Eduardo Costa, CNPq. Since its
   inception, LBNL received in 1996 a visiting scholar, Prof. Carla M. Dal
   Sasso Freitas, who joined our Electronic Notebook research efforts.
   Currently, we have two calls for collaboration issued by universities
   in Brazil (Video-on-Demand, and Parallel Indexing and Retrieval
   Methods), and one call issued by LBNL, Collaboratories.
