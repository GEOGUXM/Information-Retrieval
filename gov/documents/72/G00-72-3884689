   INDOOR AIR QUALITY TIPS & INFO.

   Did you know...

   Relative humidity is the term given to the ability of air to hold water
   vapor (gas). If a unit of air contains half of the water vapor it can
   hold, it is said to have 50 % relative humidity. If it contains all the
   water vapor it can hold, it is at 100 % relative humidity. In most
   cases, at 100 % relative humidity the water vapor turns to liquid
   creating condensation. The ability of air to hold water decreases as
   the temperature is lowered, hence outside air has less humidity in the
   winter than it does in the summer. Low humidity is below 30 % relative
   humidity.

   Do you know why we don't humidify office buildings?

   Excess moisture can cause the growth of biological organisms, including
   dust mites and fungi. Dust mites are microscopic animals that cause
   allergic reactions. The fungi can produce allergic reactions or may be
   toxic. The negatives of humidification are worse than the trade off for
   comfort. Adding moisture to the air only makes it a better environment
   for fungi, bacteria, and dust mites.

   Do you know how to combat low humidity indoors in the winter time?

   Increasing relative humidity to improve comfort is not recommended.
   However, there are steps that an individual can take to improve
   comfort. These include:
     * Drink plenty of water (increase daily intake by at least 2 cups,
       10-12 cups per day).
     * Avoid alcoholic beverages, they dehydrate.
     * Take breaks outside.
     * Avoid wearing perfumes (many are alcohol based and dry out the
       skin).
     * Remember to blink more often since this lubricates the eyes.
     * After checking with your physician, try saline solutions for nose
       and eyes to alleviate discomfort and lotions for the skin to help
       with dryness.
     * If you are a contact wearer, have your glasses with you and remove
       the contacts when eyes become irritated.
     * Another remedy that does not have any scientific basis, but
       reportedly works, is to breathe through a warm, wet towel or wash
       cloth several times a day.
