          Swecker wants to send gas tax increase to a vote of the people;
                    limit future increases to rate of inflation



   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
   January 21, 2002

                                                   FOR INTERVIEWS CONTACT:
                                           Sen. Dan Swecker (360) 786-7638

      OLYMPIA…Legislation introduced today in Olympia by Sen. Dan Swecker
      (R-Rochester) would allow the citizens of Washington to decide whether
      or not to raise the gas tax.

      "I’ve heard over and over from my district and from others across the
      state," said Swecker. "And the resounding message that I’m hearing from
      the people is, ‘Let us vote on a gas tax increase.’"

      Swecker’s bill, SB 6563, increases the gas tax by three cents in each
      of the next three years. Once that new level is reached, the
      Legislature could only raise the gas tax by the rate of inflation.
      Raising the gas tax more than inflation would require another vote of
      the people.

      "The transportation crisis in our state is reaching critical mass,"
      said Swecker. "The ‘buying power’ of the gas tax has decreased
      substantially as inflation has risen over the years. A gas tax increase
      now would be sort of a ‘catch-up’ to inflation.

      "Once we catch up, we need to sustain the buying power of the gas tax
      so we’re not in this mess again five or ten years down the road,"
      continued Swecker. "But we also need to protect the taxpayers from
      unreasonable increases. My bill accomplishes this, but ultimately
      allows the voters to decide for themselves."
