   Social Security Online

                    Web Page and Document Accessibility Policy

      We are committed to making all of our Internet documents accessible to
      everyone. To ensure that we meet or exceed the requirements of Section
      508 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, we continually review our
      site and modify pages to remove accessibility problems for people with
      disabilities.

      Many documents on our web pages are in ASCII or HTML format, accessible
      to people who use screen reading software and to those with other
      vision or mobility impairments. Generally, we use Hypertext Markup
      Language (HTML) to create pages and documents that are accessible to
      that segment of our customer base. In creating HTML documents, we
      follow Section 508 standards; for example, we include alternate text to
      describe graphics.

      Currently, our website also contains documents in Adobe Acrobat PDF
      (Portable Document Format) files; and right now, many people who use
      screen reading devices can't read them. To solve that problem, Adobe
      Systems, Inc. is developing several products designed to make PDF
      documents more accessible to screen reading software. Adobe's
      accessibility web pages (http://access.adobe.com/) describe their
      efforts. While those products are in development, we will provide text
      or HTML versions of our PDF documents.

      We also provide some Social Security publications in alternative
      formats for people who are blind or visually impaired.

   If You Need More Information

      If you use a screen reader, have vision problems, or navigate using
      only the keyboard or an assistive device, visit our alternative views
      and navigation tips pages for additional information.

   Links to Third Party Sites

      Some Social Security Online pages contain links to third party sites
      not operated by SSA. Those sites are not within our control and may not
      follow the same privacy, security, or accessibility standards as ours.
      We are not responsible for the content or availability of those sites,
      their partners, or advertisers.
