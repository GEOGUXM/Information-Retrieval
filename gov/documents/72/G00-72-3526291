Stream Flow and Ground Water

   churning water Streamflow and ground water carry nutrients, sediment,
   and contaminants into the Bay. The variability of streamflow due to
   seasonal and yearly changes in rainfall effects salinity, dissolved
   oxygen, and water clarity in the Bay. All of these factors affect the
   living resources in the Bay. The USGS measures stream flow throughout
   the Bay watershed and computes the amount entering the Bay each month.
   The ground water levels, which contributes to streamflow, are also
   measured.

   Visit the monthly water conditions page for a synopsis of the stream
   flow and ground water levels in the Bay watershed.
