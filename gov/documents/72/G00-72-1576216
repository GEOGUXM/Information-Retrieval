   The FOIA is a federal law that provides for public access to Federal
   government records in two ways. First, the FOIA requires that agencies
   automatically make public certain types of records. Second, it sets up
   a way for the public to request copies of records that are not
   routinely placed on the FTC's public record. The general philosophy of
   the FOIA is that all records of Federal government agencies should be
   available to the public, unless release of the information would cause
   specific harm. The FOIA describes nine categories of records that
   agencies need not disclose because of the potential harm that
   disclosure would cause. These categories are generally referred to as
   "exemptions" because the records they describe are exempt from the
   FOIA's general rule requiring disclosure. Section IV in the Handbook
   provides a brief explanation of each of the exemptions and an
   explanation of why certain types of information are withheld from
   disclosure.

   The purpose of the FOIA is to give the public access to existing
   government records. It does not require an agency to create records,
   conduct investigations, or develop information to answer questions. The
   FTC's policy is to provide anyone who requests information with as much
   material as we can find that is responsive to the request. If you ask
   questions, we will look for existing documents that answer those
   questions. For example, the FOIA does not require us to respond to a
   request that asks if it would be wise to purchase a particular product
   or invest in a particular business venture. To answer that type of
   request, we will look for records that relate to the product or its
   manufacturer, or the business venture, and we will also look for
   general educational materials prepared by the agency that may help you
   to understand your rights and responsibilities under the law. We will
   release those records that are not covered by one of the FOIA
   exemptions. Thus, while we cannot give you specific advice, the
   information we may be able to provide may assist you in reaching your
   own conclusions.
