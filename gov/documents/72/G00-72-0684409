      Diplomatic Actions
      With U.S. leadership and with international support, Afghans have put
      aside long-standing ethnic and political differences to form a new
      interim government, naming a president and 29 ministers with portfolio.
      The new government will also include women, who have been oppressed by
      the Taliban regime.
      On December 11, more than 120 nations around the world answered
      President Bush's call to reject terrorism and commemorate the victims
      of the September 11 attacks by holding remembrance ceremonies.
      The United States and several other allies have reopened embassies in
      Kabul.

   Solidarity Among Nations The world stands united in this effort.
   The War on Terrorism is not about any religion, country, or race.
   Our coalition partners represent nations and peoples of all cultures,
   religions and ethnic groups.
   Dozens of countries contributed to this operation in significant ways.
   We support the Afghan people against al Qaeda, which is a foreign
   presence on their land

   Russian President Vladimir Putin: "The series of barbaric terrorist
   acts, directed against innocent people, has evoked our anger and
   indignation...There is no doubt that such inhuman actions cannot be
   left unpunished. The whole international community must rally in the
   fight against terrorism."
