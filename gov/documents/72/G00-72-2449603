[world.gif] The Environmental Issues

   [bluebar.gif]

   The major environmental themes of the Aeronomy Laboratory's research
   are the chemical "well-being" of the global atmosphere (both
   troposphere and stratosphere) and climate. Several societal issues are
   embraced in this scope:

     * Stratospheric ozone depletion (Antarctic, Arctic, and global)
          + WMO/UNEP Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 1998
               o Full text of the Executive Summary
               o "Common Questions About Ozone"
               o List of International Authors, Contributors, and
                 Reviewers of the Assessment
     * Tropospheric ozone production in rural areas
     * Global tropospheric ozone production
     * Greenhouse warming
     * Effects of aircraft on the atmosphere
     * The El Ni√±o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
     * Tropical Precipitation Studies
