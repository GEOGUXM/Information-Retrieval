     NAIL is the working prototype for a future online catalog of
     holdings in Washington, DC, the regional records services
     facilities, and the Presidential libraries. Until a full catalog is
     developed, NAIL will continue to serve as the NARA's on-line
     information system.

     NAIL contains information about a wide variety of NARA's holdings
     across the country. Although NAIL contains more than 3,000 microfilm
     publications descriptions, 607,000 archival holdings descriptions,
     and 124,000 digital copies, it represents only a limited portion of
     NARA's vast holdings. To ensure you find all information in which
     you are interested, consult our home page or contact our reference
     staff.

     Please note: not all images on the NARA web site are described in
     NAIL. You may also want to visit the Digital Classroom, the Online
     Exhibit Hall, and the individual Presidential Libraries' Web sites.

     Please send comments and suggestions on the prototype to
     nail.mailbox@arch2.nara.gov

     NAIL is updated every weekend.
