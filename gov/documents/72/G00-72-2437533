   Background

   While the Philippines has come through the Asian Financial Crisis and a
   severe drought with limited adverse effects, and is now growing again,
   deeply ingrained obstacles to sustainable growth remain. The
   persistence and severity of these obstacles is highlighted by the fact
   that economic growth in the Philippines has lagged well behind most of
   its Asian neighbors over the past 30 years. This applies not only to
   the "Asian Tigers" but also to less advanced economies of the region.

   The Philippines has lagged economically while its democratic systems
   have demonstrated vibrancy and resilience. USAID intends to pursue a
   more focused strategy in promoting competition and transparency,
   combating corruption and cronyism, using systematic approaches to
   enhance donor coordination and collaboration, encouraging
   environmentally sustainable development, and employing market-based
   mechanisms to promote family planning and reforms in health services
   delivery.
