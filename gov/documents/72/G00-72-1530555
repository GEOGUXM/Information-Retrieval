   Bill Durham contacted Site Ops and requested that the visible RSR data
   logger be power cycled to correct a 30mV offset that had developed.
   Powered the data logger off at 1621 GMT.  Waited 10 minutes and powered
   back up at 1631 GMT.  Notified the mentor that the power cycle was
   complete and he logged on to the system to see if the problem was
   corrected.  At that time he found that the logger did not appear to
   reset and it was determined that the logger had to be cycled using the
   battery switch on the board and not the main power supply switch.
   Powered off the battery switch at 1647 GMT and powered back on at 1657
   GMT.  Mentor then reinitialized the logger remotely and advised that
   the problem had been corrected.

   Bill Durham advised that the humidity sensor read 104% during recent
   rain and requested that an adjustment be made. Turned the dry
   adjustment screw 1/2 turn CCW as requested. RTS at 1615 GMT.

   Received a new phone switch to be installed. R/R Command Communications
   (model ASAP 102) *phone switch with ComShare 450 phone switch. *Old -
   1000102970600383 *New - 2000450970500066. Bill Durham checked and
   verified communications are now restored. RTS at 2100 GMT.

   CAM

   Bill Durham requested that the phone switch be bypassed so that the
   phone line connects directly to the UVRSR modem. This is only to
   confirm that the switch is faulty. Connected the phone line directly to
   the modem and Bill was then able to successfully log in and restart the
   UVRSR. Returned the phone line setup to its original configuration.
   Measured the phone line voltage as 46.9 VDC to make sure a new Com
   South switch would work. RTS at 1530 GMT. Bill will send a new switch
   to be installed.

   The mentor wanted the instrument modem power cycled. Power cycled the
   modem at 1510. The mentor said this did not solve the problem and
   wanted the instrument switch power cycled. Power cycled the switch at
   1615 GMT.

   8/7/00

   MR

   The replacement cable came in today and needs to be installed. Called
   Bill Durham and notified him. Installed the cable and called Bill back.
   He said the problem seems to still be there and he was going to call
   Yankee about it in the morning. Bill called me back at 2110 GMT and
   wanted me to power cycle the instrument just to make sure the data
   logger was not hung up. Power cycled the instrument at 2115 GMT. Will
   await further instruction from the mentor.

   8/3/00

   MR

   Bill Durham sent a request that we do some testing for him over the
   phone. Called Bill at 1540 GMT. He had me remove the plug for the
   downwelling visible instrument and wait a few minutes to observe the
   data. He then had me unplug the sensor and allow it to sit for a few
   minutes. While doing the work, I noticed that the sensor cable was
   trying to pull from the connector. I notified him of this and he said
   he would send a new cable out and hoped this would solve the problem he
   was having with it. Plugged all the sensors and plugs back in and RTS
   at 1610 GMT.

   MR

   Changed out the *UVB sensor head. Called and had data downloaded before
   change out. Called and had system started back up at 2022 GMT. Shading
   checked O.K. *Old - 00389 *New - 00299

   Mentor request powering off the West side logger board for 15 minutes.
   At 2010 GMT the logger board was powered off. At 2026 GMT powered the
   logger board on. Status ok at this time. RTS at 2035 GMT.

   12/22/99

   MR

   Changed the *data logger board. Replaced the old **MFR head. Called
   George Janson and had him reinitialize the board and adjust the shadow
   band. He reported that all the channels had returned. Old Board Sn#
   B444. Removed head Sn# 00388.

   12/20/99

   CAM

   Mentor indicated that one channel of the UVRSR is not reading and
   shipped a new sensor to the site. Powered the UVRSR off at 1825 GMT.
   R/R *UVRSR sensor. Restored power at 1833 GMT. George Janson made
   adjustments to the shadow band stepper motor software to center the
   shadow on the diffuser. T/S found that the channel was still reporting
   zero when monitored remotely. Used a DVM to measure the signal being
   ouput by the sensor and found the sensor to be working properly.
   Measured the signal at several test points on the data logger and found
   the data logger is bad. Mentor will ship a replacement logger. Left the
   new sensor in place at this time. Suspect the original sensor is good
   and will confirm when replacement logger is received. *Old - 00389 *New
   - 00388

   Technicians found during daily rounds on 12/13 that there was moisture
   inside the UVB-1 dome. Notified instrument mentor who advised he would
   send a replacement Pyranometer. Received a replacement UVB-1 on 12/14.
   R/R *UVB-1 Pyranometer. Removed old sensor at 2050 GMT. Installed new
   sensor, leveled, and RTS at 2055 GMT. RTS status O.K. Old sensor will
   be returned to mentor. *Old - 930810 (Sens 1.97 (W/m2)/V Cal 7/17/97)
   *New - 920903 (Sens 1.97 (W/m2)/V Cal 6/11/98)

   The mentor wants us to change out the logger board and the radiometer
   on the UVB1. Called George Janson at 1915 and he emptied the logger of
   data. R/R the *data logger and **UVB1 radiometer. Called George back
   and he started the instrument and looked at the readings and said the
   readings looked good. RTS at 2000. *Old - B98F *New - 93916 **Old -

   The instrument mentor called and said communications with the UVB had
   been lost over the previous weekend. Troubleshooting efforts revealed
   that the UVB modem had no LED's lit. Power cycled the modem at 1545
   GMT. The LED's came back on. The mentor was able to communicate with
   the instrument after the power cycle and was able to download a data
   file from the logger. RTS at 1545 GMT.

   Removed the failed Comshare450 *telephone switch and replaced with new
   ASAP102 switch at 1800 GMT. Verified proper output from the power
   transformer at 15.2 VAC. Reconnected the line in and MFRSR and UVRSR
   phone lines. George Janson was then able to collect data from each
   instrument going through the telephone switch. The surge suppresser
   also checked good. RTS at 1815 GMT. Will ship the failed switch back to
   George.

   4/6/99

   CAM

   George Janson requested assistance to manually collect data from the
   UVRSR. The phone switch has not been working for several days now and
   UVRSR data is at risk of being lost. Connected the phone line directly
   to the UVRSR modem at 2115 GMT to allow mentor to collect data.
   Received a replacement switch today and will install tomorrow.

   The UVMFR shadow band is hitting the side of the radiometer housing.
   Called Bill Durham and notified him. He suspected the motor control
   chip on the board and said there are 2 chips which one of them is a
   spare. He Had me power the unit down at 1600 and swap the main control
   chip with the spare one. Powered up the unit at 1615 and had Mr. Durham
   reinitialize the unit. This did not repair the problem. Power down the
   unit at 1619. Mr. Durham also wanted to check for corrosion in the
   motor plug socket. Removed the socket and found it was full of water.
   Cleaned and dried out the socket and plug with compressed air. Replaced
   the socket and called Mr. Durham and notified him of the problem. He
   Reinitialized the unit and it then properly worked. RTS the unit at
   1700.

   The USDA UV-B instrument array was successfully installed at the SGP
   CART.  The instruments were installed on the vacant Southern most
   mounting pole of the SIRS E13 instruments.  An analog phone line was
   installed an connected to the CF telephone distribution panel, and
   successful communications tests were performed with the USDA network
   control in Boulder, CO.
