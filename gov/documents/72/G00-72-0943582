General Comments

   These light curves are provided for educational purposes to illustrate
   how different comets vary in brightness. They are not intended to
   represent a final scientific analysis that might be published in a
   journal.

   You are welcome to use these light curves, providing proper credit is
   given. Unless otherwise noted, these light curves have been prepared by
   Charles S. Morris. These plots are all .gif files.

   The plots given here represent the total integrated brightness of the
   coma (or head) of the comet as a function of time or distance to the
   Sun. In general, two or three plots are given for each comet. These
   include the observed magnitude of the comet plotted as a function of
   time (days from perihelion passage); the heliocentric magnitude of the
   comet, which is the observed magnitude corrected for the changing
   Earth-comet distance, plotted as a function of time; and the
   heliocentric magnitude plotted as a function of the log of the comet's
   distance from the Sun. If the brightness data follows a power-law, the
   data in this last type of plot will follow a straight line. Two
   parameters can be derived from the third plot: an "absolute" magnitude,
   the heliocentric brightness at 1 AU from the Sun, and n, the power-law
   exponent. The slope of the data will be 2.5 x n. The absolute magnitude
   is by no means absolute either during a given apparition or between
   apparitions. However, it is a means to statistically intercompare
   different comets.

Light Curves by Year

   Unless otherwise noted, all the observations are by the undersigned. I
   am working on analyzing all my observations (dating back to 1970). When
   each year is complete, I will post the light curves for that year on a
   separate page. (Note that a given comet's light curve will be posted
   under the year that it reaches perihelion.) Not all comets are observed
   for a sufficient period of time and/or have enough observations for the
   creation of a light curve. Currently, analyses have been performed for
   the years listed below.
