                           The Northeast Regional
                    Stock Assessment Workshop (SAW/SARC)

   The Northeast Regional Stock Assessment Workshop or SAW is a formal
   scientific Image of a fishing boat and net peer-review process for
   evaluating and presenting stock assessment results to managers. The SAW
   protocol is used to prepare and review assessments for fish stocks in
   the offshore US waters of the northwest Atlantic. Assessments are
   prepared by SAW working groups (federally led assessments) or ASMFC
   technical assessment committees (state led assessments) and reviewed by
   a panel of stock assessment experts called the Stock Assessment Review
   Committee or SARC.
   The panel prepares two reports: a detailed Consensus Summary of
   Assessments and a management summary called the Advisory Report. The
   Advisory Report is presented to managers at public meetings called
   Public Review Workshops. Subsequent to these workshops the Consensus
   Summary and Public Review Workshop reports are finalized and published
   as NEFSC Reference Documents.

   Beginning with the 31st SAW cycle (October 2000), Advisory Reports
   (draft versions) and Public Review Workshop reports (final version of
   Advisory Report) will be available on the NEFSC website. Beginning with
   the 33rd SAW cycle (October 2001) the Consensus Summary Reports will
   also be made available.
