   Fusion Theory
   Alan Glasser, T-15
   Principal Investigator
   Group T-15 does theory needed for the computer simulation for a number
   of situations where plasma physics and the equations of electrodynamics
   dominate. A major direction of T-15 is a response to the national
   Fusion Energy Program and processes in Tokamaks and other fusion
   devices. Contributes to nuclear science, plasma and beams as well as
   other novel applications of plasma theory ranging from space plasmas to
   novel concepts for fusion power generators are also studied in this
   group. Present studies are focused on tokomak disruptions which is a
   major plasma/materials issue facing the program. Work is also being
   done on a small, novel fusion concept based on a Penning trap.
