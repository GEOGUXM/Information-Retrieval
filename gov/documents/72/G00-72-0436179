     Every year since 1972, the Governor's Office of Planning and Research
     (OPR) has published basic information on California local planning
     agencies, including an annual survey that identifies recent planning
     activities, accomplishments, and trends. Since the 1980s, the annual
     publication that has included both the survey results and a directory
     of local planning agencies has been known as the California Planners'
     Book of Lists.

     Now this local planning information is available on-line with new
     search capabilities and up-to-the- minute updates. Through this site,
     it is possible to view the names and addresses of key planning
     officials, the current status of local general plans, and other
     information regarding a particular jurisdiction. Information is updated
     by each local jurisdiction as often as there is a change.
