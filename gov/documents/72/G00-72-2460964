   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

   Where do engineers work in the Public Health Service (PHS) Commissioned
   Corps?

   The 430+ engineer officers in the PHS Commissioned Corps work
   throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and in
   other Federal agencies/programs.  The majority of engineer officers are
   assigned to the following:
     * Indian Health Service (IHS) (58%);
     * Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (14%);
     * Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (10%); and
     * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (10%).

    What are the entry requirements?

   You must:
     * be a U.S. citizen;
     * be under 44 years of age (age may be offset by prior active-duty
       Uniformed Service time);
     * have served less than 8 years of active duty if you are/were a
       member of another Uniformed Service (click here to access the
       Former/Current Uniformed Service members section);
     * meet medical requirements; and
     * pass an initial suitability investigation.

   In addition, you must have earned a bachelor's degree or a bachelor's
   degree, plus a master's degree in engineering from an engineering
   program approved by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and
   Technology (degrees in an engineering-related curriculum, e.g.,
   engineering technology, are not acceptable).

   How much will I earn?

   Compensation varies depending on factors such as grade/rank, years of
   training and experience (T & E) in your profession, base pay entry date
   (BPED), geographic location of your duty station, and dependency
   status.  The minimum starting pay grade/rank for an engineer officer in
   the PHS Commissioned Corps is O-2 (LTJG).  Engineer graduates receive 4
   years of T & E credit for schooling leading to the bachelor's degree;
   however, a maximum of 5 years of T & E credit is given for the
   bachelor's degree earned from a university with a bona fide cooperative
   or five-year academic program.  Additional T & E credit is earned for
   time spent after receipt of the qualifying degree in degree-related
   activities.  This could be:
     * paid or volunteer work
     * college or university teaching
     * research
     * allied and relevant graduate studies and/or research.

   officer's starting rank is calculated, click   the section on the
   Training and Experience Date.

   Am I eligible for any bonuses and/or special pay?

   Yes, engineers are eligible for both contractual special pay bonuses
   and monthly special pays.  Special pays for engineer officers include
   Non-Physician Board Certified Pay (NPBCP) and Engineering and
   Scientific Career Continuation Pay (ESCCP).

   NPBCP
   is a monthly special pay for officers who possess specialty board
   certification in Professional Ergonomics and a post baccalaureate
   degree in an appropriate clinical discipline (MPH degrees are not NPBCP
   qualifying degrees).  The creditable service entry date (CSED) reflects
   the officer's years of active duty as an engineer officer in any of the
   Uniformed Services.  Rates range from $2,000 to $5,000 annually based
   on years of CSED.  In order to receive NPBCP, you must provide
   documentation of the certification.

   An Engineering and Scientific Career Continuation Pay (ESCCP)
   contractual bonus of $3,000 is available for all qualified engineers
   who are assigned to positions designated as critical shortage positions
   (currently isolated hardship duty sites) and who execute a contract to
   serve for at least one year.  The contractual agreement must be signed
   within 60 days of the officer's transfer to the qualified position.

   All contractual bonuses are prepaid lump sum payments.  ESCCP is paid
   in annual installments, and all special pays are taxable income.

   What professional groups are available in the Commissioned Corps?

   You are encouraged to find out more about the Engineer Professional
   Advisory Committee (EPAC).  The EPAC is a committee comprised of
   professionals at all grade levels who represent a cross section of the
   interests, concerns, and responsibilities of engineers in PHS and
   non-PHS organizations.  EPAC provides advice and consultation to the
   Chief Engineer Officer, who in turn reports to the Surgeon General on
   matters relating to the professional activities and personnel issues
   affecting PHS Commissioned Corps and Civil service engineers.  As a
   communications link and information source for the distinct PHS
   engineer disciplines, EPAC also: provides advice and assistance on
   engineer staffing issues, particularly recruitment; acts as a primary
   resource for engineer career development; and communicates and
   encourages the use of awards/recognition systems.  If interested in
   joining, contact the EPAC chairperson, CAPT Kevin Chadwick at
   kevin.chadwick@mail.ihs.gov or (602) 364-5058.

   The
   Society of American Military Engineers is another organization that you
   may be interested in joining.

   You are also encouraged to join the
   Commissioned Officer Association (COA), the only professional
   association specifically representing the PHS Commissioned Corps.  In
   addition to being a "voice on Capitol Hill", COA offers its members a
   range of services, including a strong professional network, financial
   services, and annual scientific meeting.  The annual meeting, usually
   held in late spring, is an excellent opportunity to meet colleagues
   from other agencies/programs, and to exchange scientific and career
   information.  For membership information, please call (301) 731-9080 or
   visit COA's web site at www.coausphs.org.
