                                                         The United States
   faces a heightened prospect that regional aggressors, third-rate
   armies, terrorist cells, and even religious
   cults will wield disproportionate power by using -- or even threatening
   to use -- nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons against our troops
   in the field and our people at home. --
   Former Secretary of Defense, William S. Cohen

   [cobb2.jpg] Los Alamos National Laboratory's Threat Reduction
   Directorate was organized in early 1998 to lead the Laboratory's
   response to new and developing threats posed by nuclear, biological and
   chemical weapons of mass destruction.

   The TR Directorate draws upon Los Alamos' broad range of expertise to
   advance and apply cutting-edge science and technology to reduce threats
   to our national security. It's a challenging mission, but I believe our
   people, working in partnership with others across the country, have the
   talent and dedication to make significant contributions to this
   important national effort.

   I invite you to learn about the Threat Reduction Directorate through
   this Web page and its links.
