   Public Disclosure Commission Meetings
      Commissioners meet, usually in Olympia, on the fourth Tuesday of each
      month, except during November and December, when meetings are scheduled
      for the third Tuesday. (Occasionally, meetings are re-scheduled to
      ensure a quorum.) The public is invited and encouraged to attend these
      meetings. Time is always reserved for public comment.
      The next Commission Meeting will be held on Tuesday, February 26, 2002,
      beginning at 9:00 a.m. The meeting will be held in the Conference Room
      in Suite 206, Evergreen Plaza Building, 711 Capitol Way, Olympia.
