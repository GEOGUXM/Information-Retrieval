   Welcome to the ARM bibliography database. This search-and-retrieval
   tool provides easy access to information about journal articles,
   technical reports, and conference proceedings published by ARM
   Scientists and infrastructure staff members. We also list journal
   articles in which the authors acknowledge using ARM data or facilities
   in their research.
   To begin your retrieval, click on the "Search and Display" button. To
   submit a paper, send the appropriate bibliographical information to the
   ARM Program Office. If you have questions, please drop us a line.
