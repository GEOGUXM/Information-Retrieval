                     Volcanic Hazards

                  Island of Hawai`i Lava-flow Hazard Zones

   Maps showing volcanic hazard zones on the island of Hawai`i were first
   prepared in 1974 by Donal Mullineaux and Donald Peterson of the U.S.
   Geological Survey and were revised in 1987. The current map (simplified
   version appears below) divides the island into zones that are ranked
   from 1 through 9 (table of hazard-zone descriptions) based on the
   probability of coverage by lava flows. Other direct hazards from
   eruptions, such as tephra fallout and ground cracking and settling, are
   not specifically considered on this map; however, these hazards also
   tend to be greatest in the areas of highest hazard from lava flows.

             Map of lava flow hazard zones for Island of Hawai`i

   Hazard zones from lava flows are based chiefly on the location and
   frequency of both historic and prehistoric eruptions. Historic
   eruptions" include those for which there are written records, beginning
   in the early 1800's, and those that are known from the oral traditions
   of the Hawaiians. Our knowledge of prehistoric eruptions is based on
   geologic mapping and dating of the old flows of each volcano. The
   hazard zones also take into account the larger topographic features of
   the volcanoes that will affect the distribution of lava flows. Finally,
   any hazard assessment is based on the assumption that future eruptions
   will be similar to those in the past.

   More detailed information about lava flow hazard zones can be found in
   Volcanic and Seismic Hazards on the Island of Hawai`i and the map
