   The Technical Standards Activities Program manages U.S. representation
   and participation in the International Organization of Legal Metrology
   (OIML), a treaty organization, on behalf of the U.S. State Department.
   OIML promotes global trade through harmonization of performance
   requirements for measuring instruments that are subject to laws or
   regulations. These instruments are used to promote equity in commerce,
   assure public and worker health and safety, and monitor environmental
   pollutants.

       Responsibility)
