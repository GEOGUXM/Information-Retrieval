                    Federal Loans, Grants and Assistance

   There are many advertisers and publishers who encourage the public to
   believe that it is impossible to obtain information on Federal grants
   and loans through the Federal Government itself. This is not true. It
   can be difficult, the search may be frustrating: there is help.

   The best overall source is the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance,
   available for use at most - but not all - Government Depository
   Libraries, on-line through the General Services Administration, or for
   sale by the Government Printing OfficeÂ’s bookstores. The Catalog lists
   most "assistance" programs of the Government, some of which do not
   offer financial assistance. When using either version of the Catalog,
   make sure that you note both the beneficiary and the applicant. In some
   cases, applicants must be State or local governments. This means that
   individuals have to determine whether their State has applied for the
   program and which State office to contact. You can usually find this
   information from the Headquarters or Regional contacts listed for the
   program.

   While the Catalog lists many programs, it is not all inclusive. Some
   agencies may have new programs or entertain unsolicited proposals. If
   you have been unable to find a contact within an agency, please call
   our National Contact Center toll-free 1-800-688-9889 (TDD/TTY users,
   call: 1-800-326-2996).
