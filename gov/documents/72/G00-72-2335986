   The Hamilton County GIS Department must balance the right of free
   access to public records guaranteed by the State Constitution and
   related laws with the privacy rights of County citizens.  One way we do
   that is to never use any information you may provide as a marketing
   tool.  Our use of cookies, for example, is limited to the current
   session as a way of uniquely identifying each customer so we can keep
   track of their order during their visit.  The cookie identifier is not
   maintained; you will get a different identifier every time you visit
   the site.  Our customer list will not be sold or revealed to others
   except to follow a court order for its release.  No customer data of
   any type is collected except if an order is placed; the information
   gathered is only that necessary to identify the purchaser and to
   deliver the ordered items.
