HCD Loans and Grants (Updated 23 October '01)

   HCD administers more than twenty programs that award loans and grants
   to hundreds of local public agencies, private nonprofit and for-profit
   housing developers, and service providers every year. This money
   supports the construction, acquisition, rehabilitation and preservation
   of affordable rental and ownership housing, child care facilities,
   homeless shelters and transitional housing, public facilities and
   infrastructure, and the development of jobs for low income workers.

   Below is a Funds Available Calendar that lists current Notices of
   Funding Availability (NOFAs) for HCD's loan and grant programs,
   including due dates for applications, award dates, and other related
   information for customers. Click on the program names to see more
   detailed program descriptions, including links to other program-related
   publications, including our Loan and Grant Program Directory, follow
   the Calendar NOFAs and application packages, contact information, and
   other program documents.

   For information about non-HCD funding sources, visit our Clearinghouse
   for Affordable Housing and Community Development Finance, which lists
   over 200 State, federal and private sources of assistance by type and
   geographical availability. We hope to offer a link to a listing of city
   and county funding programs soon.
