                     Executive Orders and Proclamations

                   Definition / Background / Update / Tip


   Definition Executive Orders are working documents directed toward
   executive agencies, authorized by the President's constitutional or
   statutory powers.

   Proclamations are official decrees, issued by the President's office,
   by law, or in response to congressional joint resolutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Background Executive Orders are issued for one of the following
   reasons: (1) to implement the President's constitutional and statutory
   responsibilities, (2) to manage the operations of the executive branch
   of the government, or (3) to manage government agencies or officials.

   Presidential proclamations are of two types: (1) ceremonial,
   designating periods of special observance, or (2) substantive, usually
   dealing with trade. Most proclamations address the general public, and
   may or may not have a legal effect.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Update Presidential documents are usually published annually in Title 3
   of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). New and/or updated Executive
   Orders and proclamations that were signed into law during the previous
   year are issued in the first quarter of each calendar year.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Tip EnviroText contains Executive Orders and Presidential proclamations
   codified since 1945, and published in Title 3 of the CFR. The
   information within EnviroText is current, and is updated as new
   compilations are made available from the Office of the Federal
   Register.

   All of this information is organized by Executive Order. In other
   words, each Executive Order is a single record. A single "hit" will
   pull an entire Executive Order for you to review or search again.

   Searches in the Executive Orders and Proclamations database can be
   defined by one or more of the following: (1) subject, (2) CFR or U.S.
   Code citation, (3) Executive Order number, or (4) agency affected. It
   is important to remember that the filtering process for this database
   is not as specific as for others (see example below for elaboration).

   For example, if you performed the search air radiation, you would
   retrieve entries that contained "air", "radiation", both words, or part
   of one or both words. In this case, the search will also retrieve
   entries that contain the word "radiating" because part of the search
   word is present (i.e., radiat..). As illustrated in this example, it is
   not necessary to include words such as AND, OR or NOT because they will
   be deleted by the filtering process of the search engine. Additionally,
   quotations may be used if you are interested in retrieving a specific
   phrase (i.e. "Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program").
