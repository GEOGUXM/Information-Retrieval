   Meteorological data available over a voice phone

   Background

   Meteorological system

   Meteorological data are continuously collected and disseminated at
   LLNL. The primary reason for collecting this data is to demonstrate
   compliance with federal laws and to assist with emergency response.
   Maintenance of the meteorological sensors and the equipment at the
   tower, the daily quality assurance, and dissemination of data are
   performed by Environmental Protection Division (EPD), Terrestrial and
   Atmospheric Monitoring and Modeling group (TAMM). The meteorologist
   responsible for this system is Frank Gouveia. The parameters included
   in our system are wind speed and direction, air temperature, relative
   humidity, rainfall, solar radiation, and pressure.

   An important part of the meteorological system is a web page; developed
   by Gary Laguna. The site is http://www-metdat.llnl.gov/ and is
   available to onsite and offsite web browsers. We have found this site
   to be very popular and useful to a variety of programs at LLNL
   including the Fire Department, environmental sample technicians, and
   construction contractors, among many others. The offsite users include
   the local winegrowers, small businesses, and the Livermore Chamber of
   Commerce.

   The universal and legitimate need for meteorological data has spawned a
   number of unmaintained and misused meteorological systems throughout
   LLNL. Although these systems may provide the required data, they
   usually don't meet accepted or appropriate standards for siting,
   response, calibration, or representativeness.

   The LLNL meteorological system consists of high-quality sensors that
   are properly sited to be away from local influences such as buildings,
   meet or exceed EPA standards for response, are routinely calibrated and
   independently audited, and are uniquely representative of ambient
   conditions at LLNL.

   Octel system

   LLNLÂ’s Telecommunications Systems Department owns, operates and
   supports an Octel Messaging Server and an associated adjunct unit that
   together provide Interactive Voice Response (IVR) capabilities. Voice
   Mail Project Manager, Patty Habel, oversees the systems, and the System
   Administrator, Dawn Freeman, performs the daily operations. Application
   development is currently outsourced to Lucent, Octel Messaging Division
   (OMD). System hardware is supported via a yearly maintenance contract.

   The Octel IVR system has the capability to take the information
   gathered by the LLNL meteorological system and convert it to voice
   recordings accessible from any touch-tone phone, by any and all onsite
   and offsite users. Additionally, this secondary access point could make
   obsolete the inappropriate meteorological systems throughout LLNL, by
   expanding the access to the LLNL meteorological system.

   Proposal

   In November 1998, people from several LLNL groups (EPD, HC,
   Telecommunications, Site 300) met to brainstorm the problem of
   dissemination of meteorological information at LLNL and potential
   technical solutions. We discussed many ideas pertaining to making
   real-time meteorological information available over a voice phone. It
   is clear that the web-based information is limited because it is only
   available to those with access to a network-connected computer. During
   this meeting several situations were identified that illustrated the
   need for meteorological data disseminated over a voice phone.

   Data transfer

   Every 15 minutes, a small file of selected meteorological data would be
   transferred via FTP (File Transfer Protocol) from EPD's to OCTEL's
   computer. Checks will be made of the data to insure quality and
   timeliness. Data from redundant sensors may replace data that are
   unavailable due to scheduled maintenance or sensor malfunction.
   Meteorological data from Sandia may also be available for an added
   level of redundancy.

   Voice product

   The proposed Interactive Voice Response application will convert the
   available data to a voice message accessible from any touch-tone phone.
   The latest meteorological data is transferred via ASCII text to the IVR
   application that simply converts the text and fills in the blanks of a
   prerecorded message. The result is an understandable voice message that
   is available to someone dialing a particular LLNL phone number. Dawn
   Freeman's voice will be used in this message, as this will maintain
   lab-wide consistency.

   Outcalling

   Another idea that is easy to implement and is currently in use for
   other OCTEL applications is Outcalling. If the weather data meets some
   preset criteria, then a radio page, a prerecorded call, or an email is
   sent to individuals or groups. An example of this function would be to
   warn the Maintenance Mechanics of an extended period of freezing
   temperatures so they can take action to minimize damage from frozen
   pipes. With Outcalling used in this way, personnel responsible for
   weather-sensitive equipment are relieved from reviewing the web page or
   other meteorological sensors.

   Long-term Support

   TAMM is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the present
   meteorological system. The LLNL Weather Pages and associated databases
   are both a part of TAMM's meteorological data quality program and will
   remain so for the foreseeable future.

   LLNL's Telecommunications group maintains the phone system as part of
   the established Lab overhead. Individual mailboxes associated with the
   application have an associated recurring cost $5 per month, and phone
   lines, of which most likely there would be only one, a monthly
   recurring cost of $17.00/each. These small costs may be directed to
   TAMM or the account of the most active user of the proposed
   application.

   Summary

   An ad hoc group identified several situations where it would be
   beneficial to make LLNL meteorological data available over a voice
   phone, not the least of which, being the value of the redundancy
   created by having the information available via a separate medium.
   Initial costs would be that of application development and
   implementation by Lucent, OMD. With limited information available
   regarding the intricacies of the application, the best rough estimate
   that Octel could provide was that the most basic of applications runs
   approximately $15,000 for development and implementation.

   Next steps

   We will now contact the responsible groups to request support for the
   development of a system, and get clarification of needs to ensure that
   the system will meet their specifications. Once conceptual approval is
   received OMD will create a high level proposal including cost of
   development and implementation.
