     * GEO-Data Explorer (GEODE)
       The USGS Energy Resources Program has developed the GEO-Data
       Explorer (GEODE), an interactive program that makes available, over
       the Internet, various map coverages and datasets that can be used
       for decision making on energy and related land-management issues.
       This system can integrate various databases from USGS scientific
       investigations with state-of-the-art digital and Internet
       capabilities to provide scientific decision support. The system is
       designed to consist of comprehensive National geospatial coverage
       and Internet accessibility for rapid analysis of emerging issues.
       The GEODE (formerly named DE2) includes capabilities for
       user-driven GIS (geographic information system) mapping and
       user-defined queries of coverages and active databases that are
       linked from many sources.
     * Energy Resources Program Bibliography
       This database contains publications of the USGS Energy Resources
       Program from 1994 through 1997 on coal, oil, and natural gas
       resources by program staff. Database is not georeferenced although
       many records can be searched to a locality but no convention has
       been used such as Quadrangle name or County name.
     * NCRDS (National Coal Resources Data System)
       An integrated system of databases that can be extracted and used in
       commercial software to produce maps, resource calculations, and
       coal quality location maps. All information is available in GIS
       format. NCRDS correlates and standardizes coal data from Federal
       and State agencies, universities, the private sector, and foreign
       countries.
     * COALQUAL (Coal Quality) Database
       Comprised of the USGS OFR94-205 CD-ROM, 1994. This database is both
       available as a searchable database on the internet and as a CD-ROM
       which contains searchable. Major-, minor-, and trace-element coal
       analyses by USGS laboratories. Standard USBM analyses are included
       for many samples. All sample localities are georeferenced by
       Lat/Long. Available via Internet and as CD-ROM.
     * US COAL RESOURCES Database
       Contains published coal-resource estimates for coal bearing states
       listed by state, county, coal field, geologic age, formation, rank,
       coal thickness, overburden thickness, and reliability of resource
       estimates. Georeferencing is by County.
     * COAL PRODUCTION Database
       Historical Production Data for the Major Coal-Producing Regions of
       the Conterminous United States. Data is georeferenced by counties.
       Data Compiled as USGS Open-File Report 97-447.
     * 1995 NATIONAL OIL AND GAS ASSESSMENT Database
       (Contact: David Ferderer, dferdere@usgs.gov)
       Comprehensive data and results from assessment of National oil and
       gas resources completed in 1995. This database includes digital
       maps of the Nation and each oil and gas province showing play
       boundaries and results of historical drilling activity in each
       play, as well as play summaries and resource estimates.
     * NATIONAL ENERGY RESEARCH SEISMIC LIBRARY
       Archive of public domain, multichannel seismic reflection data and
       related information. Preserved and available on CD-ROMs.
     * NATIONAL PETROLEUM RESERVE IN ALASKA Database
       (Contact: Nick Zihlman, zihlman@usgs.gov)
       Repository of all geological and geophysical data used to assess
       oil and gas potential of the NPRA. Includes over 8,000 magnetic
       tapes of digital seismic, well log, gravity, and magnetic data,
       hundreds of printed well logs, and many geologic and geochemical
       reports.
     * GAS GEOCHEMISTRY Database of Former USBM
       Digital database containing compositional results of thousands of
       natural gas analyses performed over several decades by the U.S.
       Bureau of Mines.
     * NATIONAL OIL-SHALE Database
       (Contact: John Dyni, jdyni@usgs.gov)
       Digital database containing assay and chemical analyses of
       thousands of oil-shale samples.
