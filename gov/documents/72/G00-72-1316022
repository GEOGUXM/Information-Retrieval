Current and Recent Conditions Around Los Alamos
     __________________________________________________________________

   Tables and plots of current and recent conditions around Los Alamos are
   based on data acquired from the Laboratory's meteorological network.
   These products were originally developed for quality assurrance and
   emergency response applications.

   Eventually, real-time quality control algorithms may be implemented,
   but until that is complete, you will occasionally encounter some bad
   data in these products. However, data loss is typically less than 5%.
   Instruments are maintained to a high standard.

   Meteorological Variables
   See the Meteorological Monitoring Plan for definitions of the variables
   used in these products. Derived quantities not discussed in the
   Monitoring Plan can be found here.

   Brief Tabular Summary in English and SI Units
   These two tables are designed to give you a snapshot of current
   conditions at the five meteorological towers. Since the TA-41 tower is
   in Los Alamos canyon, conditions there will usually be quite different
   than conditions at the other towers.
   In these tables, the wind variables are measured at 11 meters above the
   ground and the atmospheric state variables (temperature, humidity, and
   pressure) are measured at 1.2 meters above the ground.

   Detailed Tabular Summary, Short or Long Form
   These tables show all measured variables and derived quantities. The
   short form covers the last 15 minutes; the long form allows you to
   scroll back 12 hours. These tables are the only products that allow you
   to see how wind and temperature change with height.

   Current Wind Vector Field
   The wind vector field was recently updated to show the Pajarito
   Mountain tower and the Los Alamos Canyon tower. The mountain station
   shows the ambient wind conditions and can be useful in predicting
   changes in the winds on the plateau. The canyon station gives an
   example of winds in one of the local canyons having a 'V' shape with a
   depth-to-width ratio of 0.3.

   As before, the wind vector field is computed using wind measurements at
   the 11-m level at the four towers on the Pajarito Plateau using a 1/r^2
   weighting scheme, where r is the distance from a vector's grid point to
   a particular tower. The towers at Pajarito Mountain and Los Alamos
   Canyon are not used in computing the wind field. Additionally, only
   wind direction is depicted in the arrows drawn for the Pajarito
   Mountain and Los Alamos Canyon towers. The reason for excluding these
   two towers from the computed wind field is the large differences that
   often occur between these two sites and sites on the plateau. Also note
   that the wind direction and speed "circles" for Pajarto Mountain and
   for Los Alamos Canyon are not in their correct locations on the map--
   the true location of the Pajarito Mountain station is off of the map to
   the west, and the location of the Los Alamos Canyon station is at the
   TA-41 triangle (shown on map) northeast of TA-6.

   Measured wind speeds at each of the plateau towers can be seen near the
   end of the red arrows. Speeds at the interpolated locations (black
   arrows) can be estimated by comparing their length to one of the
   measured locations on the plateau. The interpolated wind speeds and
   directions should be used with caution, and it should be reiterated
   that these are only estimations.

   Experiments show that, on the average, the mean absolute error in
   estimating wind direction at locations a few kilometers from a tower is
   30 degrees, and the mean absolute error in wind speed is 0.8 m/s. These
   errors increase for light winds and decreases for strong winds.

   Time Series for the last 12 hours
   This plot shows how conditions have changed over the last 12 hours. The
   wind variables are measured at the 11 meter level, and the state
   variables are measured at 1.2 meters. Note that 25 millibars have been
   subtracted from the pressure signal at the TA-54 station; this allows
   us to plot both stations on the same axes with good resolution.
   Astronomical sunrise and sunset are indicated by the vertical dashed
   lines.

   Time Series for Yesterday
   In the 24 hour plot summary, the occurrence of the maximum 1 minute
   wind gust is marked with an 'X,' and the maximum instantaneous wind
   gust is noted with a triangle. Maxima and minima of the state variables
   are indicated with triangles and diamonds, respectively.

   Summary for Last Month
   The monthly summary is the same as the one you see published in the
   newspaper. It is based on data from the official weather station at
   TA-6. We try to update the summary by the 10th of the new month.

   Recent Summaries
   These products allow you to review past conditions. For information on
   conditions that occurred during the previous year or earlier, go to
   local climatological information.

   Pajarito Mountain
   The Pajarito Mountain link shows current conditions on top of Pajarito
   Mountain (near the top of the Aspen Ski lift in the Los Alamos Ski
   Area). For details on this station, see the Pajarito Mountain station
   notes.

   Fuel Moisture
   The fuel moisture link provides the current 10-hr fuel moisture
   (measured) and 1-hr fuel moisture (estimated), as well as a time-series
   plot of the previous 96 hours of these two quantities. The fuel
   moisture measurement, taken near the TA-6 meteorological station,
   provides insight into the local fire danger. For details, see the fuel
   moisture notes.
