                              Real-Time Water Data

   ! Real-time hydrologic data are considered provisional data. Please be
   aware of the limitations this imposes. We recommend reading U.S.
   Geological Survey Circular 1123: Stream-Gaging Program of the U.S.
   Geological Survey.

   Interactive real-time map, text station list available below
   Select A Retrieval Option for Station Data:
   (*) State list || ( ) State map || ( ) 10 nearest stations
   The colored dots on the map depict streamflow conditions as a
   percentile, which is computed from the period of record for the current
   day of the year. Only stations with at least 30 years of record are
   colored.

   The gray circles indicate other stations that were not ranked either
   because they have fewer than 30 years of record or because they report
   parameters other than streamflow (e.g. stage only).

   Using the map you can select the ~10 nearest stations to the point you
   click, a list of all the stations in a state, or an interactive map of
   a state. You also may use the list below to obtain data by state. The
   state lists may have some stations -- especially lakes or
   newly-installed stations -- that are not on the maps.

   You can view a [new] tab-delimited list of all stations on the map. You
   also can see a larger map of the ranked stations, more explanations,
   and an animation, or visit our Drought Watch site!

Status Notes

   Local sites may have additional notes.

   When a site goes down...
   Streamflow data are collected by backup systems when a district server
   fails. In an emergency like a flood, we can read the backup data and
   report river stage and streamflow to authorities. We did exactly that
   when Hurricane Fran knocked out our North Carolina office. This is a
   fairly labor-intensive process, however, so we can't do it on a regular
   basis. We are working to provide automatic redundancy but are not yet
   there. We thank you for your patience.
