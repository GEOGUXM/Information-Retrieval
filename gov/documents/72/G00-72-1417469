         The Office of Strategic Planning and Economic Analysis was established
           to provide economic, technology assessment, and strategic planning
          expertise for NIST-wide policy analysis and planning activities. SPEA
             conducts cross-cutting strategic planning, economic impact, and
          economic role/policy studies that benefit several operating units or
          NIST as a whole; provides methodological assistance to OUs conducting
          their own economic analysis; and represents NIST in external economic
          policy exercises where topics are NIST-wide in scope. SPEA is located
          under the NIST Program Office, and is managed by Dr. Gregory Tassey.
              For additional information on particular documents or related
              activities, please contact: Paul Doremus in the SPEA office.

Recent Impact Assessments

   The studies cited below are recent economic impact assessments of
   projects undertaken by NIST Measurement and Standards Laboratories.
   NIST has been conducting economic impact studies on a regular basis
   since 1992, as a means to 1) provide management with information on the
   nature and magnitude of NIST research projects; 2) inform the policy
   and budget communities of the economic returns to society from NIST
   projects; and 3) fulfill GPRA requirements for performance evaluation
   data. NIST also uses these studies to evaluate completed and ongoing
   research and related projects, as well as to support strategic planning
   processes.

   In general, economic impact measures such as the benefit-cost ratio
   (BCR) and social rate of return (SRR) provide rigorous, useful and
   informative outcome data. However, they do not provide a comprehensive
   measure of all economic consequences associated with NIST research and
   services. Moreover, BCR and SRR outcomes cannot be compared across
   different impact assessments. For a number of fundamental reasons, each
   study is unique to the project, technologies, and industrial effects it
   seeks to illuminate:
     * Infratechnologies and services provided by NIST typically affect a
       broad array of industries, and often influence many layers of
       activity within a given industry (from R&D through production and
       marketing). Variation across industries, combined with the diverse
       and often diffuse effects of infratechnologies, create empirical
       challenges unique to each impact assessment.
     * In most cases, it is virtually impossible to measure all of the
       downstream effects of NIST research and services. Most of NIST's
       impact analyses have focused on firms and/or industries in the
       supply chain that benefits most directly from NIST output. Even at
       that level, unique data-gathering challenges arise from differences
       in the number of firms, the distribution of firm size, and the
       relationships between supplier and user firms.
     * Data collection and methodological choices also are affected by
       variations in the character of NIST infratechnologies as well as by
       differences in how those technologies are delivered over time.

   Collectively, the entire set of economic impact studies conducted to
   date demonstrates that the rates of return on NIST infratechnologies
   consistently match or exceed rates of return to private investment in
   technology. In addition, these studies and other economic analyses
   suggest that public investment in infratechnologies complements private
   investment in proprietary technologies, which in turn generates higher
   rates of economic growth.
