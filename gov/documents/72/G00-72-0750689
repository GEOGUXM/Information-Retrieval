     Hydraulics & Hydrology Research

     The hydraulics and hydrology research program at the TFHRC has four
     coordinated elements:
     * First, most of our research has been done through universities,
       private research firms and other government agencies. The FHWA
       contract research program on bridge scour was a high priority
       research area during the 1990's.

     * Second, we provide liaison for National Cooperative Highway
       Research Program (NCHRP) projects related to hydraulics and
       hydrology. There are approximately eight such NCHRP projects
       currently active.

     * Third, we provide technical support and advice when needed for
       major State planning and research studies.

     * Finally, our most visible part is the TFHRC hydraulics laboratory
       where we conduct fundamental research, provide technical support of
       engineering circulars published by our CBU partners, and provide
       technical engineering service to FHWA division offices and State
       DOT's.

     The laboratory is operated by a contractor funded mostly by an FHWA
     administrative contract, but the contract is structured to
     facilitate utilizing funds from other government offices and State
     DOT's for service.  We maintain a research summary which gives an
     up- to-date status of the overall hydraulics and hydrology research
     program and lists the publications that have been developed over the
     years. (see H&H Research Summary)
