   Products
   Spacecraft Flight Software (FSW)
   Spacecraft FSW manages and controls all spacecraft activities typically
   including ground communication, ground command processing, onboard
   execution of the science schedule, spacecraft maneuvers and pointing
   control, orbit determination and control, telemetry generation and
   mission health and safety.

   Science Instrument FSW
   Science Instrument FSW is embedded software developed for the
   instrument flight data system--typically to manage the instrument
   configuration, science observation characteristics, data management and
   instrument health and safety.

   Flight Component FSW (power, GN&C, SSR)
   In addition to spacecraft and instrument FSW, the Code 582 also
   develops specialized software for flight components and subsystems.
   Examples include control software for spacecraft power subsystems, and
   wide-band solid-state data recorders.

   FSW Simulators
   Quality simulators are essential tools for the verification validation
   and on-orbit troubleshooting of flight software. Simulators span a
   large range of implementations, from software-only simulators to very
   high fidelity full-function systems incorporating flight equivalent
   hardware and precise simulation of an on-orbit spacecraft environment
   and hardware dynamics.

   FSW Support Tools
   Specialized FSW tools are developed to maximize productivity and
   quality during FSW implementation, test, and data analysis.
   Furthermore, this tools help maintain on-orbit operation interfaces.

   FSW Branch Technology Initiatives
   FSW Branch Technology Initiatives include activities, typically funded
   separate from flight project activities, which are specifically
   intended to increase the functionality of FSW, improve the FSW
   development process, demonstrate a new FSW concept or demonstrate an
   end-to-end mission operations concept in conjunction with other
   organizations.
