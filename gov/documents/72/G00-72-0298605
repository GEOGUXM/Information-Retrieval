Science Support for Wetland Restoration in the Napa-Sonoma Salt Ponds, San
Francisco Bay Estuary

   [Black-necked stilts]
     * The San Francisco Bay estuary has experienced tremendous human
       population growth during the past 150 years and a subsequent loss
       of natural habitats and degradation of water quality.
     * More than 91% of the tidal wetlands has been lost to reclamation
       for farmland, salt evaporation ponds, and residential or industrial
       propert.
     * Many native species dependent on tidal wetlands are now endangered
       or candidate species for listing.

   The goal of this research project was to examine the ecological and
   hydrological function of the Napa-Sonoma salt ponds and their
   importance for waterbirds, including integrated studies on primary
   productivity, macroinvertebrates, plants, and fishes. This progress
   report presents the preliminary research results from the first year of
   the fieldwork.

Linkage of Bioaccumulation and Biological Effects to Changes in Pollutant
Loads in South San Francisco Bay

   [Percent of reproductively active clams]

   This poster answers the questions:
    1. What are the long-term (1977-1997) trends of metals in the
       sediments and clams near the outfall of the Palo Alto Regional
       Water Quality Control Plant (PARWQP)?
    2. Can point-source inputs be distinguished from non-point-source
       contributions?
    3. Does metal exposure affect the reproductive capability in South Bay
       clams?

The History and Effects of Exotic Species in San Francisco Bay

   [Mya arenaria]

   Mya arenaria, pictured left
   Learn about:
     * what an exotic species is,
     * how they got to San Francisco Bay in the first place,
     * what damage they've done,
     * what they're doing now, and
     * what the future holds...

Primary Production in San Francisco Bay

   [Map showing primary production]

   Primary Production is the synthesis of new plant matter by microscopic
   plants (algae) through the process of photosynthesis. Learn how USGS
   scientists measure algae in the Bay and how its total mass can be
   compared to that of Humphrey, the humpback whale

Managing Coastal Resources of the U.S.

   [Managing coastal resources]

   Based on over 20 years study of San Francisco Bay, USGS scientists
   highlight their findings concerning nutrient enrichment and toxic and
   biological contamination. There are important practical lessons for
   policymakers.

   "Steps of improved wastewater treatment have gradually reduced the
   inputs of toxic metals to San Francisco Bay. USGS monitoring has shown
   that these investments to remove contaminants have resulted in
   improvements in some indicators of biological health, such as metal
   concentrations in clams living near a wastewater discharge."
