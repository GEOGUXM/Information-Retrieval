   Post-Judgment Interest Rates

       In December 2000, Congress enacted the Omnibus Appropriation Act
   (PL 106-554) that contained, among its various provisions, amendments
   to the federal statutes dealing with the interest rate on federal
   judgments. 28 U.S.C. ยง1961, 18 U.S.C. ยง3612, and 40 U.S.C. ยง258(e)(1)
   tie interest rates on judgments to Treasurys 52-week T-bill interest
   rate. Expecting that Treasury would discontinue auctions of the 52 week
   T-bills in the future, Congress passed legislation to establish a new
   interest rate index that was readily available. Treasury will, in fact,
   discontinue the auction of 52-week T-bills at the end of this month.
   The revised sections took effect on all judgments entered on and after
   December 21, 2000. (Prior judgments will use the old auction rates.)
   Only the rate that is applied to judgments has changed. All other
   computational procedures remain the same. Interest rates are now
   changed weekly.
       Current rates can be found at
   http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/H15/Current  The applicable rate
   is listed under US Government Securities - Treasury Constant Maturities
   - 1-year. The specific rate is found under the column headed week
   ending MM/DD, where MM/DD is the month and week ending date, e.g., Jan
   26 or Feb 2. Use the rate for the calendar week preceding the date of
   the Judgment.  If there is a need for rates that were in effect for
   periods before receipt of this notice, they can be found at
   http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/H15/data/wf/tcm1y.txt  If you
   have any questions regarding the changes to the rate, or have problems
   identifying which rate is applicable, please contact Mike Eisert, in
   the Administrative Office of the Courts Accounting and Financial
   Systems Division, at (202) 502-2207
