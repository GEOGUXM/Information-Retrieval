                  Click here to access your Training History

   Before you enter our training site for the first time, we would like to
   provide you with the following guidance:

   ·        You should have a minimum 56K internet connection and you must
   use Internet Explorer 4.x or Netscape Communicator 4.x or above.

   ·        The graphics content may cause the screens to load slowly at
   times.  We are working on these issues and welcome your comments and
   suggestions.

   ·        The first screen will give you an option of the class you wish
   to select.  As of this date, the only class available is the Raffles
   class.

   ·        The second screen will give you the option of logging on or
   entering the training as a guest.  ONLY THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN
   NOTIFIED THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEND TRAINING FOR LICENSING
   PURPOSES ARE REQUIRED TO LOG IN.  PLEASE DO NOT LOG IN IF YOU ARE JUST
   VISITING THE SITE AND DO NOT NEED TO HAVE A TRAINING RECORD CREATED.

   Those logging on will be required to supply at least an organization
   number or gambling license number.

   If you do not have that number, you may still log on and we will
   attempt to locate the appropriate training record in which to place
   your information.

   If your name and/or organization has an apostrophe (') in it, please
   omit it when entering the information.  As an example O'Sullivan would
   be entered as OSullivan.

   ·        If you do not complete the training in one sitting, the site
   allows you to return within 30 days to finish.  Otherwise, you will be
   required to log in again and start the course over.  If you return to
   the training within 30 days, you should click the drop down arrow next
   to "Returning User?" and select your name.  After you select your name,
   just click on LOGIN.  You do not have to enter any other information.

Troubleshooting Tips

   If you find that the training content does not fit onto the screen
   size, you may need to make the following fixes to your display settings
   on your computer.

   Text on headings is cut off:  Your screen size must be 800x600.

   Text on headings runs into text below and/or text is cut off:  Change
   your font settings to small.


                                 Go to training
