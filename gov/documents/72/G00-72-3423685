      LEONIDS: RARE EARTH ENCOUNTER WITH COMET DUST TRAILS

      In 1999, we saw the first meteor storm of the space age. Even now, the
      societal and physical effects of meteor storms remain unclear. Will a
      particularly intense meteor storm cause satellites to malfunction some
      time in the future? What chemical reactions will occur as the meteors
      incinerate? Might cometary debris have influenced the development of
      life on Earth?

      The current episode of Leonid storms is a unique chance to study these
      issues. The figures below show how the showers have manifested itself
      in the past years and how our understanding has gradually improved with
      new observations.

      The graphs in the middle are a map of where the dust is located,
      according to calculations by David Asher of Armaugh Observatory. Each
      colorfull elipse is the point where a trail of dust, from one of comet
      55P/Tempel-Tuttle's returns to the Sun, crosses the Earth's orbital
      plane. The blue trails are the onces closest to Earth's orbit. Those
      are detected as Leonid showers. The year of origin of each trail is
      marked. The path of Earth is shown as an orange line.

      The observed Leonid shower rates in the years 1998, 1999 and 2000
      during Leonid MAC missions and from data gathered by the International
      Meteor Organisation are shown on the right. The rates are in unit of
      "Zenith Hourly Rate", the count of meteors seen by a visual observer
      when the sky conditions are ideal and the shower radiant is in the
      zenith. The horizontal axis shows the time in hours since November 18
      at 0h UT of a given year. The graphs for 2001 and 2002 are predicted
      rates by one of several dust models, in particular that of Esko
      Lyytinen and Tom Van Flandern (which is sort of in the middle of
      predicted levels of activity). Note that the encounter with each blue
      trail resulted in a peak of Leonid shower activity.

      Each encounter is unique and provides important information about the
      exact location of the dust trails and the dust properties of different
      ages. From precise measurements, Leonid MAC PI Dr. Peter Jenniskens
      derived such properties as the meteoroids density, how much dust is
      ejected by the comet in each return, and how fast the spin axis of the
      comet nucleus wobbles around. More information here.
