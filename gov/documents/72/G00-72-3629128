   MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT JOHN N. ERLENBORN

   Welcome to the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) site on the World Wide
   Web. This site represents one of the many ways in which LSC has applied
   technology to improve the provision of civil legal assistance to those
   in need. LSC funds 216 legal aid programs around the nation to help
   poor Americans gain equal access to the judicial system. As the need
   for assistance grows while budgets remain stagnant or are reduced, LSC
   is encouraging its grantees to use available technology to stretch
   resources further.
     John N. Erlenborn, President

                              John N. Erlenborn

   Our web site allows us to reach out to a larger segment of the public
   than ever before. It was developed to inform you about LSCs work and
   the services available; increase the efficiency and client services
   within grantee programs; and establish an interactive exchange among
   Corporation staff, grantees, clients, and potential clients.

   As you browse our site you will learn that legal services cases arise
   out of the everyday problems of the poor. Usually they relate to
   matters of family law, housing, employment, government benefits, or
   consumer problems. Left unresolved, these problems can cost society
   much more than the expense of legal services to address them. Therefore
   LSC, which receives 100 percent of its budget from Congress, supports a
   strong federal role in the funding of legal services so the poor will
   have somewhere to turn when in crisis.

   I hope you find our site to be useful and informative. Check in often
   for the latest in LSC newswhats happening in Washington and in the
   field. I welcome your suggestions for improving the site; just e-mail
   LSC at info@lsc.gov.
