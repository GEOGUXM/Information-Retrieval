   ARS National Program "Global change" is a shortened form of the phrase
   global environmental change. It refers to large-scale changes in
   Earth's biological, geological, hydrological, and atmospheric systems.
   Agriculture is vulnerable to these environmental changes. Successfully
   adapting to change depends upon a quantitative and predictive
   understanding of the ways that agriculture and food supplies may be
   affected by climate change, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and ozone
   levels, and increased UV-B radiation. Title XXIV of the 1990 farm bill
   directed the Secretary of Agriculture to "study the effects of global
   climate change on agriculture," including "the effects of simultaneous
   increases in temperature and carbon dioxide on crops of economic
   importance; the effects of more frequent or more severe weather events
   on such crops; the effects of potential changes in hydrologic regimes
   on current crop yields;" and other possible impacts.
