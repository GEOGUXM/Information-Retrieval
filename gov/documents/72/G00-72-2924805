   ARTICLE C.1 INTRODUCTION

   The Neural Prosthesis Program (NPP) of the National Institute of
   Neurological Disorders and Stroke supports research and development on
   systems to restore function in neurologically impaired individuals
   through functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS). Clinical research
   supported by the NPP has resulted in functional upper extremity systems
   for quadriplegic individuals. This initiative will conduct research on
   a system for people afflicted with paraplegia that would allow them to
   independently rise and remain standing so that they can do activities
   that they cannot accomplish in a wheelchair.

   Specifically, the feasibility of developing a splint-free, low-energy
   standing system through FNS will be investigated. The goal is to
   develop a system that permits an individual to rise and stand for
   periods of at least 20 minutes and then sit again unassisted. Standing
   must be maintained without requiring exhausting muscular exertion or
   significant conscious attention to maintain balance. The system must
   also leave the hands and arms free for other tasks. Recent progress in
   the development of biomechanical models of standing and walking and in
   the development of solid-state sensors including multiple axes
   accelerometers and miniature gyroscopes combined with continued
   progress in FNS makes this a promising area for research at this time.

   the NPP is available free of charge from the Neural Prosthesis Program,

   ARTICLE C.2 STATEMENT OF WORK

   Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor
   shall exert its best efforts to demonstrate the feasibility of a
   splint-free, low-energy standing system for paraplegic individuals.

   Specifically, the contractor shall:

   A. Obtain or develop a biomechanical model of the body including the
   ankle, knee, hip, and trunk that is suitable for modeling sit-stand and
   stand-sit transitions and standing.

   1. The model shall include the actions of FNS on the muscles needed for
   these activities.

   2. The model shall include simulated, body mounted sensors.

   3. The model shall simulate closed-loop control of these activities
   using the sensors and FNS.

   4. The model shall include methods for estimating energy expenditure
   during the standing activity.

   B. Using the model of A.) as a starting point, design and implement a
   system of sensors and electrically stimulated muscles to effect stable
   standing with minimal energy expenditure.

   C. Demonstrate in human paraplegic volunteers using the FNS system
   designed in B.), functional standing for periods of at least 20
   minutes.

   1. Stable standing shall be accomplished without the use of any
   orthotic bracing to the trunk, hip, knee or ankle.

   2. Standing shall permit free use of the arms in lifting and moving
   loads of at least two kilograms.

   3. The stability of the standing position shall be such that it will
   resist external destabilizing forces reasonably encountered in daily
   activity.

   4. Muscular energy expenditure, as measured by oxygen consumption above
   the basal metabolic rate, shall not exceed two times the muscular
   energy expenditure required for standing in normal individuals.

   5. Consideration shall be given to minimizing the risk of injury in the
   event of an unexpected disturbance that results in a fall.

   D. Using the model of A.) as a starting point, design and implement a
   system of sensors and electrically stimulated muscles that, combined
   with the voluntary use of upper body musculature, can effect unassisted
   sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transitions in paraplegic individuals.
