                       Journals in Print
                       The Wirtz Labor Library currently subscribes to over 200 print
   journals, largely in the areas of employment issues, economics and
   labor. The Library also maintains subscriptions to many local and
   national newsletters and updates published by a wide variety of trade
   unions.

   The Library has a rich historical collection of past issues of trade
   union publications, statistical publications, and economic journals,
   many of which are stored in the Library's closed archival collections
   due to their age and rarity. Arrangements can be made through the Wirtz
   Labor Library Reference staff to use archival materials on the DOL
   Library premises. To search these collections, go to the Library
   Catalog.
