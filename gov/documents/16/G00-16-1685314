   [greenline.gif]
   The Pine Ridge Association is an official state park cooperating
   association that was formed in 1975 to assist park staff in designing
   interpretive and educational programs and presenting the programs to
   the public.

   PRA activities include guided walks, evening programs in the Visitor
   Center, and annual events such as the Mother's Day breakfast, the Coe
   Backcountry Weekend, and the fall TarantulaFest.  The Pine Ridge
   Association publishes a newsletter (The Ponderosa), maps, interpretive
   leaflets and books, and free informational handouts.
   The California Department of Parks and Recreation and the Pine Ridge
   Association sponsor a uniformed volunteer training program.  Uniformed
   volunteers contribute thousands of hours to the park each year.  If
   you've visited Coe Park, chances are you've been assisted by a
   uniformed volunteer.

   The Pine Ridge Association welcomes your support.  The annual PRA basic
   membership dues are $10 for an individual, $15 for a family or
   household, and half price for seniors 62 and over.  With your
   membership, you'll get a subscription to the The Ponderosa, an
   opportunity to join your fellow members on special outings in the
   backcountry, and a 15 percent discount on most of the items in the PRA
   museum store.

   If you'd like to join the PRA without further ado, please fill out a
   membership form.
