   Public Works
   Trust Fund     Drinking Water
               State Revolving Fund

   Public Works Trust Fund

   Who is eligible?
   Local governments that are eligible for PWTF loans includes counties,
   cities, towns and special purpose districts.  Although private
   utilities, private enterprises, school districts, port districts, and
   tribal governments are not eligible for PWTF funding, the Board
   encourages partnerships with eligible local governments.  This could be
   in the form of an inter-local agreement with the owner of the improved
   facilities.

   What is eligible?
   Eligible projects are those that include the repair, replacement,
   rehabilitation, reconstruction, or improvement of eligible public works
   systems.  Eligible systems are: Bridge, Road, Domestic Water, Sanitary
   Sewer, Storm Sewer, and Solid Waste (includes recycling).

   When is the Construction Loan Program Cycle?
   The PWTF Construction Loan program has an annual cycle.  Applications
   are available in January, with completed applications due in April.

   Does the PWTF offer any grants?
   No.  All programs under the Public Works Board are loan programs.

   What counts/doesn't count a local match?
   Any revenues that can be used at the discretion of the local government
   can be used as local match.  State and federal grants are not
   considered local match.

   Can leftover funds be used for something else?
   No.  The loan may be used only for eligible activities that are within
   the Scope of Work, and may not be used for any other purpose.

   Are PWTF loan recipients required to follow competitive bid laws?
   Yes.  The enabling legislation for the PWTF requires that "all projects
   aided in whole or in part under the provisions of this chapter shall be
   pt out for competitive bids, except for emergency public works under
   43.155.065 for which the recipient shall comply with this requirement
   to the extent feasible or practicable.  The competitive bids called for
   shall be administered in the same manner as all other public works
   projects put out for competitive bidding by the local government entity
   aided under this chapter."  Small works rosters are considered part of
   the competitive bidding process.  Force account work is not permitted.

   Does the PWTF fund sanitary sewer side service connections?
   Yes.  Sanitary sewer systems may be extended to include the repair
   and/or replacement of sanitary sewer side service connections on
   privately owned property, if it can be demonstrated the work done on
   the private property will benefit the public system.  The applicant, at
   the time of application, must have in place an ordinance or resolution
   declaring such repair and/or replacement to be a public policy of the
   jurisdiction and setting forth the finding of public benefit.

   Does the loan count against constitutional debt limits?
   Under legislation passed in 1987, PWTF loans do not impact a
   jurisdiction's statutory debt ceiling (RCW 39.69), although the
   constitutional debt ceiling remains the same.

   How long do you have to use the funds?
   The PWTF Construction Loan program allows 48 months for construction.
   The project must be complete and closed out by the end of that period.

   When are Construction loan funds available?
   PWTF Construction loan funds are available approximately one year after
   loan application.

   Legislation which established the program requires the Public Works
   Board to evaluate applications for eligible activities and recommend a
   prioritized list of projects to the Legislature by November 1 of the
   application year.  Projects on the prioritized list become part of a
   bill to be reviewed by the Legislature.  The Legislature has the
   authority to remove projects from the list, but not to add projects.
   Once the Legislature has approved the measure, the bill is forwarded to
   the Governor for signature.

   After the Governor's signature, staff proceed immediately to initiate
   loan agreements.

   How are Construction loan funds disbursed?
   Construction loans funds are disbursed in three draws:

   15% of the loan amount may be drawn immediately upon loan execution.

   80% of the loan amount may be drawn upon the execution of a Notice To
   Proceed following the formal award of a construction contract.

   The final 5% is disbursed upon project close-out.

   How is debt service calculated and when do loan repayments begin?
   Loan payments are due annually beginning June 30th of the year
   following legislative approval of the loan.  The first payment is
   interest only on the amount drawn to date.  Subsequent payments are a
   portion of the principal (1/19th on a 20 year loan) plus interest on
   the unpaid balance of the loan.  The result is an amortization schedule
   in which annual payments decrease.

   What about GMA conformance?
   All counties, cities, and towns planning under the Growth Management
   Act (GMA) must be in conformance with the Act at the time of loan
   application.  To be considered in conformance, jurisdictions must have
   adopted their comprehensive plans and development regulations at the
   time of application or their GMA required dates, whichever is later;
   and jurisdictions must not be out of compliance (as determined by a
   Growth Management Hearings Board) at the time of application.

   Do SPD's need to conform with GMA?
   No.  Special Purpose Districts are eligible to apply, even if the
   counties, cities or towns they operate within are not in conformance
   with GMA.  To meet threshold requirements, the applicant must have a
   capital facility plan that meets the Board's standards.

   What about Pre-Construction Activities?
   Pre-construction activities can be completed under your construction
   loan.  However, the Board also offers a program designed to help local
   governments accelerate the construction of eligible public works
   improvements and provide more flexible financing options.
   Pre-Construction loan funds are available immediately after Board
   approval and execution of the loan.  Applications are usually due in
   September.  You have the option of doing all your work under one
   Construction loan, or applying for both a Pre-Construction and
   Construction loan.  If you choose to go with two loans, you can extend
   the term of your Pre-Construction loan to 20 years under certain
   circumstances.

   Drinking Water State Revolving Fund

   Who is eligible?
   Publicly and privately owned water systems.

   What are eligible projects and activities?
   Funds from DWSRF loans may be used to:
     * Address existing water system problems that may cause a drinking
       water system to exceed health standards as defined by the Safe
       Drinking Water Act;
     * Replace aging infrastructure to maintain compliance or to further
       public health protection goals of the Safe Drinking Water Act;
     * Acquire real property from a willing seller if it is integral to a
       project needing to meet or maintain compliance and further public
       health protection;
     * Planning and design costs directly related to an eligible project;

     * Reservoirs (clear wells) that are part of the treatment process and

     * Distribution reservoirs (finished water).
