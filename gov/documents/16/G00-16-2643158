   What is ITOS?

      ITOS is a real-time control and monitoring system developed and
      maintained by a small team at the Goddard Space Flight Center. It is a
      portable, highly configurable system which runs under a variety of UNIX
      operating systems, including Solaris, FreeBSD, and Linux on workstation
      or PC hardware, and best of all it's FREE!. ITOS was originally
      developed for control of spacecraft and spacecraft components during
      development, test, and on-orbit operations, but actually can be applied
      to most any control and monitoring process.

   ITOS is Available Free!

      The ITOS software is available free. However, please remember that it
      is subject to U.S. Export Restriction. You must contact the U.S.
      Department of State to obtain an export license if you wish to use or
      distribute ITOS outside of the U.S.

      While we try to support all users the best we can, we are very resource
      limited. When getting started, please try to obtain as much information
      through our online documentation as you can before e-mailing us with
      questions. However, if you can't find the information you are looking
      for, feel free to send e-mail to itos@itos.gsfc.nasa.gov . This is our
      group e-mail account and will be directed to our entire development
      team. Please do not e-mail individual team members unless directed.
