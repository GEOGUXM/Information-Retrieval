     About Advanced Life Support...

     Picture of the Red Planet When humans embark on long duration
     missions such as the establishment of permanent bases on the Lunar
     surface or travel to Mars for exploration, they will continue to
     need food, water and air. For these long duration missions it may
     not be economical or practical to resupply basic life support
     elements from Earth. The National Aeronautics and Space
     Administration (NASA) and the space community will need to develop
     systems to produce food, purify their water supply, regenerate
     oxygen and remove undesirable components of the air. A life support
     system that would perform these regenerative functions is included
     in the goals of the NASA Advanced Life Support Program. Such a
     system would be a tightly controlled and closed loop system in which
     the growth of crop plants would contribute to the life support
     functions. The natural function of plants would provide food and
     contribute to water purification, air revitalization and even the
     processing of waste materials. All systems would have to operate
     under the restrictions of minimizing volume, mass, energy, and
     labor.

     Research on human life support began in the 1950's with oxygen
     regeneration using algae. NASA's interest in such systems became
     more focused in the late 1970's in order to support long-term space
     missions. Since that time, the Advanced Life Support Program at NASA
     has examined growing plants for food and oxygen regeneration, and
     the use of physico-chemical and biological methods to process waste
     into usable resources. At the Johnson Space Center a number of tests
     have been completed in which human test subjects were included to
     determine the efficiency, reliability, and effectiveness of
     regenerable systems for long duration missions.

     Information about NASA's activities to develop and test such
     technologies is provided by following the links located in the
