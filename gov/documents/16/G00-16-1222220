             NEW WEB SITE HELPS RECRUIT STUDENTS TO FEDERAL JOBS

   ===========================================

   The Office of Personnel Management and the U.S.
   Department of Education recently unveiled a new Internet website --
   www.studentjobs.gov --

   designed specifically for high school and college
   students who are looking for temporary employment with the federal
   government.

   In April 2000, OPM and the Department of Education's
   Student Financial Assistance (SFA) office formed a partnership to
   develop Studentjobs.gov. For students looking to get into the work
   force, the site lists federal job openings and provides valuable
   insight into the hiring process, programs and benefits.

   "By offering students easy access to all the
   information they need for their federal job search, we can help them
   simplify their search and show them why the government should be their
   employer of choice," said OPM Acting Director Steven R. Cohen.

   SFA Chief Operating Officer Greg Woods said, "We're
   delighted to partner with OPM to deliver a great new product to help
   students across the country find jobs in government."

   Studentjobs.gov features include:

   * Links to student-employment pages for more than 50
   federal agencies

   * Links to articles that profile student job
   opportunities

   * A link to the federal government's worldwide
   employment information database of permanent federal jobs

   * Email notification every 24 hours for newly posted
   vacancies that meet the student's personal job-search profile

   * A resume builder and online application tool

   According to the press release, studentjobs.gov is
   compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act and includes both
   graphic and text versions. It provides a seamless, integrated search
   tool for students to get information about federal employment
   opportunities. It also offers links to other federal web sites.
