    _____________________________________________________________________

   Since achieving statehood in 1850, California has had 40 Lieutenant
   Governors and 5 Acting Lieutenant Governors. Nine of these men
   eventually became Governor either because of the death or resignation
   of the Governor, or by being elected in their own right after the
   Governor left office. The most recent Lieutenant Governor who succeeded
   to the governorship was Gray Davis, who is CaliforniaÂ’s current
   Governor.
