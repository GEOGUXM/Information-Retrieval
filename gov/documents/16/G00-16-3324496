                  Global Land Biosphere Data and Resources

     Welcome to the Global Land Biosphere Data and Information Web Site
     at the Goddard Space Flight Center's Distributed Active Archive
     Center (DAAC). Below, you will find information on what Land
     Biosphere Data are, how to get it, how to understand it, and who has
     been involved in bringing it to you. Go to the Goddard DAAC Homepage
     to find other Earth science data and information.

     The NOAA/NASA AVHRR Land Pathfinder Home Page (formerly at
     xtreme.gsfc.nasa.gov) is now held here. See Announcements & New
     Additions for a listing of the new pages.

     The AVHRR WWW Browser is now fully operational. This browser allows
     the user to view browse image representations of the entire data
     collection and then easily place an order for the original data.
