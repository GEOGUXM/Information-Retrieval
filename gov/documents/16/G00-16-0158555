   Williams Aviation Consultants, Inc. (formally G & C Aviation
   Consulting) prepared this report for the San Francisco Bay Conservation
   and Development Commission (BCDC). It, along with many other agencies,
   is working with the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) to
   prepare adequate environmental assessments for a potential runway
   reconfiguration project.

   Any proposed new runway configuration would require Bay fill. As part
   of BCDC's mandate, the filling of the Bay can only occur if no other
   alternatives are feasible to meet SFO's requirements. The regulatory
   agencies have been asked to concur in the selection of an adequate
   range of project alternatives being considered by SFO and the lead
   review agencies. The array of alternatives was presented to the public
   in the lead agencies' (Federal Aviation Administration and San
   Francisco Office of Environmental Review) "Status Summary 2" in late
   2000. Four reconfigured runway alternatives, requiring up to two square
   miles of Bay fill, were developed. A system management alternative,
   which could increase capacity at SFO without filling the Bay, was also
   proposed.

   The regulatory agencies were concerned that this "no fill" alternative
   was not to be considered in the federal environmental document (EIS)
   and that it was not adequately covered in the state document (EIR). G &
   C Aviation Consulting, Inc. was retained to review the reports
   analyzing the "no fill" alternatives in the environmental review
   process and to access the causes of aircraft delay at SFO in order to
   provide a context for their recommendations. The FAA documents reviewed
   wereSFO Runway Configuration Program EIR/EIS, Alternatives Considered
   and Eliminated From Detailed Study, Preliminary ReportandSFO Runway
   Configuration Program EIR/EIS, Demand Management Alternatives,
   Preliminary Reportboth dated November 2000.

   Williams Aviation Consultants, Inc. was subsequently tasked to evaluate
   the revised Charles River report titledThe Report on Reductions in
   Flight Operations as an Alternative to Runway Reconfiguration at San
   Francisco International Airport dated April 2001 as well as the report
   of the Technology Panel titledPotential Future Contribution of Air
   Traffic Management Technology to the Capacity of San Francisco
   International Airportdated August 2001.

   This document contains the final reports for each task as well as the
   consultant's conclusions regarding the validity of the four reports and
   recommendations for actions that would assure adequate review of the
   "No Build" option.
