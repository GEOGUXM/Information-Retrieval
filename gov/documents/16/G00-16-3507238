   The Earth is constantly bombarded with high speed particles coming not
   only from the sun, but also from outside of the solar system. Studying
   these energetic particles can help us understand the origin and
   evolution of our solar system. The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)
   spacecraft carries nine instruments that can collect and measure these
   particles 10 to 1000 times better than previous spacecraft. From ACE,
   Scientists on Earth will receive information about the solar wind such
   its velocity, temperature, and composition.

   ACE will orbit the sun very near the Earth (approximately 1/100 of the
   distance from the Earth to the sun). From here it will be able to
   determine which particles hit the Earth. This information will help
   scientists to better understand phenomena such as solar flares. Ace
   will also be able to warn us of encroaching geomagnetic storms that
   disrupt communications and are hazardous to astronauts.
