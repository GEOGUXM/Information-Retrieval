   Dual-processor 667/733MHz PowerMacs due by April Rumor

      According to reliable Apple sources, new PowerMac G4 configurations
      including dual-processor versions of the 667 and 733MHz models will
      become available in a matter of weeks -- possibly before the end of the
      month, but almost certainly by mid-April. Quad-processor versions have
      been considered, but due to the high cost of PowerPC 7450 processors at
      present, Apple does not expect to introduce four-way MP until its next
      major PowerMac revision this summer.
