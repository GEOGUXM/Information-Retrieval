                        City Signs Water Agreement
                            Tuesday, January 15

    Flagstaff Mayor Joseph Donaldson has signed a stipulation between
    the City of Flagstaff and the United States on behalf of the
    National Park Service and the Forest Service. The stipulation is the
    result of seven years of negotiations over water rights between the
    City and the Federal Government. Mayor Donaldson stated The
    Agreement recognizes Flagstaffs water rights and at the same time
    provides protection of water resources for the National Parks and
    Forest Service. It addresses concerns regarding the Walnut Creek
    Watershed and protects the Citys rights to continue groundwater
    development. The Justice Department has recognized Flagstaffs right
    to store and use water from Upper Lake Mary with conditions agreed
    to by the City. Conditions include maintaining a minimum pool of
    2,350 acre-feet of water (except for an emergency) and minimizing
    withdrawals to no more than 4 million gallons per day during runoff.
    The City of Flagstaff Utilities Department has indicted the
    restrictions will have little impact on the present operation of the
    City water system. In addition to addressing surface water, the
    Department of Justice recognizes Flagstaffs existing right to
    withdrawal of 42,600 acre-feet of groundwater annually and future
    development of an additional 20,000 acre-feet. In return, the City
    has agreed to perform a hydrological study prior to drilling new
    water wells within a two-mile zone of the Pine Grove Campground,
    Wupatki National Monument, Sunset Crater National Monument, or
    Walnut Canyon National Monument. Both parties agreed to monetary
    contributions toward studying management practices for the Walnut
    Creek Watershed. Study work may include activities such as livestock
    grazing, timber harvesting, road drainage, and recreational
    activities that impact the quantity and quality of water.
