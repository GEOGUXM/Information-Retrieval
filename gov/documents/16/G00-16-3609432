     s766.101 Data utilization.

     DOE shall use the records from the Toll Enrichment Services System
     (TESS) and other records maintained by the Oak Ridge Operations
     Office in order to determine the total SWUs purchased from DOE for
     all purposes. DOE shall use records from TESS, relevant records of
     domestic utilities, and such other information as DOE deems to be
     reliable and probative in determining the number of SWUs that were
     purchased by each domestic utility prior to October 24, 1992. A
     domestic utility shall be considered to have purchased a SWU from
     DOE if the SWU was produced by DOE but purchased by the domestic
     utility from another source. DOE shall consider a purchase to have
     occurred upon the delivery of a SWU to the domestic utility
     purchasing the SWU. A domestic utility shall not be considered to
     have purchased a SWU from DOE if the SWU was purchased by the
     domestic utility but subsequently sold to another source.

     s766.102 Calculation methodology.

     (a) Calculation of Domestic Utilities' Annual Assessment Ratio to
     the Fund. Domestic utilities shall be assessed annually for their
     share of the Fund. The amount of the assessment shall be determined
     by the ratio of SWUs produced by DOE and purchased by domestic
     utilities prior to October 24, 1992, to the total number of SWUs
     produced by DOE for all purposes (including SWUs produced for
     defense purposes). All calculations will be carried out to the fifth
     significant digit. This ratio is expressed by the following
     hypothetical example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
SWUs purchased by all            Total SWUs                Special
domestic utilities               produced--all             assessment
                                 purposes                  ratio
---------------------------------------------------------------------
12345 ................. + ...... 45678  = ................ .27026
---------------------------------------------------------------------

     (b) Calculation of the Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment for
     Domestic Utilities. The Annual Special Assessment ratio calculated
     in paragraph (a) of this section shall be multiplied by $480
     million, yielding the total amount of the Baseline Total Annual
     Special Assessment as of October 1992. In the event that this amount
     is in excess of $150 million, the Baseline Total Annual Special
     Assessment shall be capped at $150 million. All calculations will be
     carried out to the fifth significant digit. The Baseline Total
     Annual Special Assessment is determined as shown in the following
     hypothetical example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Total fund        Annual assessment     Baseline total annual special
                      ratio                        assessment
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 $480,000,000 .. x .. 0.27026  = .............. $129,724,800
---------------------------------------------------------------------

     (c) Calculation of Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment per
     Utility. The ratio of the total number of SWUs purchased by an
     individual domestic utility for commercial electricity generation,
     to the total number of SWUs purchased by all domestic utilities for
     commercial electricity generation, multiplied by the Baseline Total
     Annual Special Assessment calculated in paragraph (b) of this
     section, determines an individual utility's share of the Baseline
     Total Annual Special Assessment. All calculations will be carried
     out to the fifth significant digit. A hypothetical example of such a
     calculation follows:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Single     All utility   Utility    Baseline total    Individual utility      SW
Us        ratio         annual         utility
SWUs                                  special         special
                                    assessment        Assessment
---------------------------------------------------------------------
300 ... +  .12345 = ... .02430 x .. $129,724,800 ... $3,152,312.64
---------------------------------------------------------------------

     (d) Calculation of Inflation Adjustment. The Baseline Total Annual
     Special Assessment billed to domestic utilities shall be adjusted
     for inflation using the most recently published monthly CPI-U and
     the CPI-U for October 1992. All calculations will be carried out to
     the fifth significant digit. A hypothetical example of such a
     calculation follows:

 --------------------------------------------------------------------
  CPI-U (Mar 93)          CPI-U (Oct 92)        Adjustment multiplier
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 150 ............ + ........... 141.8  = .............. 1.05783

       _______________________________________________________________

     s766.103 Special Assessment invoices.

     (a) DOE shall issue annually a Special Assessment invoice to each
     domestic utility. This invoice will specify itemized quantities of
     enrichment services by reactor. In each Special Assessment invoice,
     DOE shall require payment, on or before 30 days from the date of
     each invoice, of that utility's prorated share of the Baseline Total
     Annual Special Assessment, as adjusted for inflation using the most
     recently published monthly CPI-U data.

     (b) DOE shall enclose with the Fiscal Year 1993 Special Assessment
     invoice a sealed, business confidential, summary SWU transaction
     statement including:

     (1) TESS information which documents, by reactor, the basis of the
     utility's assessment;

     (2) A list of domestic utilities subject to the Special Assessment;

     (3) The total number of SWUs purchased from DOE by all domestic
     utilities for all purposes prior to October 24, 1992.

     (4) The total number of SWUs purchased from DOE for all purposes
     prior to October 24, 1992, including SWUs purchased or produced for
     defense purposes; and

     (5) Such other information as may be appropriate.

     (c) With regard to any fiscal year after Fiscal Year 1993, DOE shall
     enclose a summary SWU transaction statement with Special Assessment
     invoices that will include updated information regarding adjustments
     to Special Assessments resulting from the reconciliation and appeals
     process under Section 766.104.

     (d) The date of each Annual Special Assessment invoicing will be set
     on or about October 1 with payment due 30 calendar days from the
     date of invoice starting with the Fiscal Year 1995 Special
     Assessment.

       _______________________________________________________________

     s766.104 Reconciliation, adjustments and appeals.

     (a) A domestic utility requesting an adjustment shall, within 30
     days from the date of a Special Assessment invoice, file a notice
     requesting an adjustment. Such notice shall include an explanation
     of the basis for the adjustment and any supporting documents, and
     may include a request for a meeting with DOE to discuss its invoice.
     If more time is needed to gather probative information, DOE will
     consider utility requests for up to 90 days additional time,
     providing that the initial notice requesting an adjustment was
     timely filed. The notice shall be filed at the address set forth in
     the Special Assessment invoice, and filing of this notice is
     complete only upon receipt by DOE. Domestic utilities are considered
     to have met the filing requirements upon DOE's receipt of the notice
     requesting an adjustment without regard to DOE's acceptance of
     supporting documentation. The filing of a notice for an adjustment
     shall not stay the obligation to pay.

     (b) DOE may request additional information from domestic utilities
     and may acquire data from other sources.

     (c) After reviewing a notice submitted under paragraph (a) of this
     section and other relevant information, and after making any
     necessary adjustment to its records in light of reliable and
     adequately probative records submitted in connection with the
     request for adjustment or otherwise obtained by DOE, DOE shall make
     a written determination granting or denying the requested
     adjustment. As appropriate, DOE shall modify the application of TESS
     data for any discrepancies or further transactions raised during the
     reconciliation process.

     (d) Any domestic utility that wishes to dispute a written
     determination under paragraph (c) of this section shall have the
     right to file an appeal with the Office of Hearings and Appeals,
     U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue S.W.,
     Washington, DC 20585. Except for the Fiscal Year 1993 Special
     Assessment, any appeal must be filed on or before 30 days from the
     date of the written determination and should contain information of
     the type described in 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart H. With regard to a
     written determination under paragraph (c) of this section concerning
     a Fiscal Year 1993 Special Assessment, a domestic utility must file
     an appeal on or before 30 days from the effective date of this
     paragraph or from the date of such written determination, whichever
     is later. The decision of the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall
     be the final decision of DOE. Upon completion of the reconciliation
     process, all records of SWU transactions shall be finalized and
     shall become the basis of subsequent Special Assessment invoices.
     These records shall be revised to reflect any decisions from the
     Office of Hearings and Appeals and any applicable court rulings.

     (e) Refunds of Special Assessments shall be provided in cases where
     DOE has determined, as a result of reconciliation, that an
     overpayment has been made by a domestic utility, and that the
     domestic utility has no further current obligation to DOE.

     s766.105 Payment procedures.

     DOE shall specify payment details and instructions in all Special
     Assessment invoices. Each domestic utility shall make payments to
     the Fund by wire transfer to the Department of Treasury.

     s766.106 Late payment fees.

     In the case of a late payment by a domestic utility of its Special
     Assessment, the domestic utility shall pay interest at the per annum
     rate (365-day basis) established by DOE for general application to
     monies due DOE and not received by DOE on or before a designated due
     date. Interest shall accrue beginning the date of the designated
     payment except that, whenever the due date falls on a Saturday,
     Sunday, or a United States legal holiday, interest shall commence on
     the next day immediately following which is not a Saturday, Sunday,
     or United States legal holiday. Late payment provisions for the
     Special Assessment to the Fund shall be based on the Treasury
     Current Value of Funds Rate (which is published annually by the
     Treasury and used in assessing interest charges for outstanding
     debts on claims owed to the United States Government), plus six (6)
     percent pro rata on a daily basis. The additional six (6) percent
     charge shall not go into effect until five (5) business days after
     payment was originally due. Late payment fees shall be invoiced
     within two days of receipt of utility payment of the special
     assessment when delinquency is less than 30 days. For longer periods
     of delinquency, DOE will submit additional invoices, as appropriate.
     Late payment fees will be due 30 days from the date of invoice.

       _______________________________________________________________

     s766.107 Prepayment of future Special Assessments

     DOE shall accept prepayment of future Special Assessments upon
     request by a domestic utility. A domestic utility's liability for
     the future assessments shall be satisfied to the extent of the
     prepayments. DOE shall use the pro rata share of prepayments
     attributable to a given fiscal year plus the Special Assessments
     collected from utilities who did not prepay for that fiscal year, in
     order to determine that the total amount of Special Assessments
     collected from domestic utilities in a given fiscal year does not
     exceed $150 million, annually adjusted for inflation.

     I. Background

     Sections 1801, 1802 and 1803 were added to the Act by Title XI of
     the EPACT (Pub. L. 102-486). Section 1801 establishes the Fund in
     the Treasury of the United States (42 U.S.C. s2297g). Amounts on
     deposit in the Fund are available to the Secretary of Energy,
     subject to appropriations, for D&D and remedial action activities at
     DOE's uranium enrichment facilities and for reimbursement of uranium
     and thorium licensees for certain costs of D&D, reclamation, and
     other remedial actions incurred by licensees at active uranium or
     thorium processing sites, as specified in Title X of the EPACT (42
     U.S.C. s2296a et seq.). The Act provides that amounts in the Fund be
     invested by the Secretary of the Treasury in obligations of the
     United States. The Act also requires the Secretary of the Treasury,
     after consultation with the Secretary of Energy, to report to
     Congress annually on the financial condition and operations of the
     Fund.

     Section 1802 of the Act provides that the Fund shall consist of
     annual deposits of $480 million per fiscal year, to be annually
     adjusted for inflation using the Department of Labor's Consumer
     Price Index for all-urban consumers (CPI-U)(42 U.S.C. s2297g-1(a)).
     Deposits to the Fund are required to include a Special Assessment on
     domestic utilities not to exceed $150 million per fiscal year
     (adjusted for inflation using the CPI-U). Section 1802 also
     authorizes appropriations to be deposited into the Fund in the
     amount necessary to ensure that the total annual amount of $480
     million (adjusted for inflation using the CPI-U) is deposited (42
     U.S.C. s2297g-1(b)). The amount collected from each domestic utility
     for the Special Assessment shall be in the same ratio to the total
     amount to be deposited in the Fund, for each fiscal year, as the
     total amount of separative work units (SWUs) the utility has
     purchased from DOE for the purpose of commercial electricity
     generation, prior to the date of enactment of the EPACT (October 24,
     1992), bears to the total amount of SWUs purchased from DOE for all
     purposes, including units purchased or produced for defense
     purposes, prior to October 24, 1992 (42 U.S.C. s2297g-1(c)).

     Collection of the Special Assessment is authorized as of the date of
     enactment of the EPACT (October 24, 1992), and shall continue for a
     period of the earlier of 15 years or until $2.25 billion (adjusted
     for inflation using the CPI-U) has been collected (42 U.S.C.
     s2297g-1(e)). A Special Assessment levied on domestic utilities is
     deemed by the Act to be a necessary and reasonable current cost of
     fuel, fully recoverable in a utility's rates in the same manner as
     other fuel costs (42 U.S.C. s2297 g-1(g)).

     Section 1803 provides that the National Academy of Sciences shall
     conduct a study and provide recommendations for reducing the costs
     associated with D&D of the Department's uranium enrichment
     facilities, and report its finding to Congress within 3 years after
     the date of the enactment of EPACT (42 U.S.C. s 2297g-2(a)). This
     section specifies that the costs of D&D activities are to be paid
     from the Fund until such time as the Secretary of Energy certifies,
     and the Congress concurs, that the activities are complete (42
     U.S.C. s2297g-2(b)). This section also specifies that the annual
     costs of remedial action at DOE's uranium enrichment facilities
     shall be paid from the Fund to the extent the amount available in
     the Fund is sufficient (42 U.S.C. s 2297g-2(c)).

     II. The Interim Final Rule and the Proposed Rule

     On August 2, 1993, DOE published an interim final rule (58 FR 41160)
     and a proposed rule (58 FR 41164) which set forth the procedures for
     calculation and collection of the Special Assessment from domestic
     utilities for deposit into the Fund.

     The interim final rule became effective on September 1, 1993. This
     rule revises PART 766 by including amendments from the proposed rule
     and adding a new section on prepayments.

     The interim final rule set forth those procedures, which the EPACT
     does not leave to DOE discretion, for calculation of the Special
     Assessment from domestic utilities for deposit into the Fund. DOE
     issued the rule as an interim final rule to allow for public comment
     while facilitating timely administrative action to comply with the
     obligation to collect the Fiscal Year 1993 Special Assessment from
     utilities by no later than September 30, 1993. The proposed rule
     expanded the interim final rule by adding new sections that address
     substantive matters left by the EPACT to DOE discretion, such as the
     required method of payment, late payment fees, and administrative
     appeals. On August 30, 1993, a public hearing was conducted by DOE
     on the proposed rule. No attendees asked to make oral presentations.
     A transcript of this hearing is available in the Freedom of
     Information Public Reading Room, 1000 Independence Avenue,
     Washington, DC 20885.

     During the public comment period, written comments on the interim
     final rule were received from a total of nine organizations
     representing domestic utilities, electric power industry groups, and
     Congress. Written comments were received on the proposed rule from
     seven organizations with the same affiliations.

     DOE has considered and evaluated the comments received during the
     public comment period. In addition, DOE has addressed comments from
     two utilities it received outside the public comment period. The
     following discussion describes the comments received, provides DOE's
     response to the comments, and describes any changes incorporated
     into the rule.

     III. Response to Public Comment

     A. Detailed Listing of Activities To Be Paid From the Fund

     Several commenters requested that DOE provide a detailed listing of
     the activities at the gaseous diffusion plants that are to be paid
     from the Fund. Activities that are to be paid from the Fund are
     those that are authorized by the EPACT and subsequently approved by
     Congress in appropriation bills. A listing of these activities and
     other pertinent information is annually released to the public by
     the DOE in the Office of Environmental Management's annual budget
     documentation. Because this information is prepared and modified
     annually, and is made available to the public, the final rule does
     not include a detailed listing of all activities that are to be paid
     from the Fund. However, the following are examples of the types of
     activities at the gaseous diffusion plants that DOE believes would
     appropriately be paid for from the Fund: demolition of buildings,
     Resource Conservation and Recovery Act closures and surveillance and
     maintenance activities.

     B. Definition of Commercial Electricity Generation

     Several commenters requested that DOE provide a definition of
     "commercial electricity generation." This term was not defined in
     the EPACT. Given that the amount collected from a utility is based
     upon its purchases of SWUs for the purpose of commercial electricity
     generation, DOE has added a definition to the final rule.

     Commercial electricity generation means the production of
     electricity for sale to consumers. Power produced under the power
     demonstration program operated by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)
     falls within the definition of commercial electricity generation.
     However, SWU deliveries to reactors wholly owned by the AEC under
     the power demonstration program, even though they fall within the
     definition of commercial electricity generation, are considered
     deliveries of SWUs to the government and not to domestic utilities,
     since domestic utilities did not purchase these SWUs from DOE or its
     predecessor agency the AEC. Therefore, they will not be included in
     the calculation for domestic utilities, but will be included in the
     calculation for total SWUs produced.

     C. Treatment of SWUs in Leased Material in Calculating the Special
     Assessment

     One commenter requested clarification concerning the treatment of
     SWUs in leased material in the calculation of the Special
     Assessment. The commenter suggested that the use of leased SWU
     material in calculating the Special Assessment would overstate its
     Special Assessment and would be inappropriate because unused
     portions of leased material were returned to the Government. Leased
     material is appropriately included as part of the Special Assessment
     to the extent that the material was for the purpose of commercial
     electricity generation. Utilities paid "use and burnup charges" for
     the portion of leased material that they consumed. These charges
     were based on the number of SWUs consumed. Therefore, leased
     material is being treated as purchased material and is subject to
     the Special Assessment. A utility's Special Assessment will be
     adjusted for those portions of SWUs in leased material that it did
     not consume and that were returned to the Government. In addition,
     DOE has added a definition of "use and burnup charges" to the final
     rule.

     Domestic utilities converted lease contracts to "in-situ" ownership
     contracts when the Atomic Energy Act was amended to allow private
     ownership of special nuclear materials. The original Special
     Assessment invoices included SWUs delivered under lease contracts
     and under "in-situ" contracts. Several commenters noted that the
     SWUs in these assessments were double counted as a result of SWUs
     being counted as lease deliveries and in-situ deliveries. DOE agrees
     with these comments. The Fiscal Year 1994 Special Assessment
     invoices will be adjusted to correct for this double counting.

     D. Calculation of Future Assessments

     Several commenters observed that the EPACT states that the Special
     Assessment should be "annually adjusted for inflation" and that the
     final rule should reflect this requirement and indicate when the
     inflation adjustments will commence. The final rule specifies that
     the annual Special Assessment shall be adjusted for inflation each
     fiscal year following the first Special Assessment using the most
     recently published monthly Consumer Price Index for all urban
     consumers (CPI-U) published by the Department of Labor and the CPI-U
     for October, 1992. (See section 766.102(d)). DOE believes that this
     provision, which establishes an adjustment for inflation on each
     annual assessment following the first Special Assessment,
     appropriately implements the inflation adjustment requirement of
     EPACT. DOE waived the inflation adjustment to the first Special
     Assessment because domestic utilities had no control over the date
     of the issuance of the interim final rule, which established the
     date of the first Special Assessment.

     E. Treatment of DOE Produced SWUs Re-Entering the U.S. Domestic
     Market in Calculation of the Special Assessment

     One commenter requested clarification as to how DOE plans to treat
     any DOE produced SWUs that were sold to foreign utilities and that
     re-enter the domestic market. This commenter questioned how this
     would affect the reconciliation of SWU records for recalculating the
     Special Assessment. During the reconciliation process, DOE will
     identify these SWUs from information provided by utilities and from
     other sources to which DOE has access, such as the Nuclear Materials
     Management and Safeguards System (NMMSS), a joint DOE-Nuclear
     Regulatory Commission (NRC) database. DOE-produced SWUs that were
     sold to foreign utilities and later re-entered the domestic
     commercial market would have the effect of increasing the number of
     DOE- produced SWUs purchased by domestic utilities for the purpose
     of commercial electricity generation in relation to the total number
     of DOE-produced SWUs purchased from DOE for all purposes, as stated
     in the EPACT. The Special Assessment invoices will contain
     information on the total number of DOE- produced SWUs purchased by
     domestic utilities, including those purchased from foreign
     utilities. When the reconciliation process is complete, DOE will
     provide utilities with a summary of all adjustments made during the
     process.

     F. Treatment of Fabrication Losses in Calculation of the Special
     Assessment

     Several commenters requested clarification as to how DOE will treat
     fabrication losses in calculating the Special Assessment. The
     commenters stated that fuel fabrication losses were not used in
     commercial electricity generation and therefore should not be
     included in the calculation of the Special Assessments.

     In determining a utility's Special Assessment, the EPACT does not
     require a SWU to have actually been used in commercial electricity
     generation, but only to have been purchased for that purpose.
     Therefore, DOE will not adjust Special Assessments to exclude
     fabrication losses.

     G. Treatment of SWUs Sold to Domestic Utilities That Shut Down Their
     Nuclear Power Plants Prior to Enactment of the EPACT

     Several commenters questioned the applicability of the Special
     Assessment to reactors that have ceased operations or are scheduled
     for shut down during the 15-year assessment period. The commenters
     asserted that the intent of EPACT is to levy Special Assessments
     only upon operating domestic utilities. Relying on EPACT's statement
     that a utility may recover the cost of its Special Assessment as a
     "current cost of fuel * * * recoverable * * * in the same manner as
     the utility's other fuel cost," 42 U.S.C. s2297g-1(g), one commenter
     argued that Congress intended to exempt non-operating facilities.
     This language, according to the commenter, suggests a Congressional
     intent to subject a utility to the Special Assessment only if it has
     at least one operating facility, by which it incurs "other fuel
     cost."

     DOE believes that the EPACT is unambiguous in regard to the
     statutory applicability of the Special Assessment to domestic
     utilities. The statutory provision governing application of the
     Special Assessment is 42 U.S.C. s2297g- 1(c). This section states
     that: "The Secretary shall collect a special assessment from
     domestic utilities," and that the amount collected from each utility
     shall be proportional to the "total amount of separative work units
     such utility has purchased from the Department of Energy for the
     purpose of commercial electricity generation, before October 24,
     1992." If prior to October 24, 1992, a utility purchased SWUs from
     DOE for the purpose of commercial electricity generation, EPACT's
     plain terms subject such a utility to the Special Assessment. EPACT
     provides no exceptions for utilities that satisfy this condition of
     applicability.

     One commenter points to a separate provision on rate recoverability
     as the basis for implying an exemption from the Special Assessment.
     DOE does not believe that the provision in EPACT authorizing a
     utility's rate recovery of its Special Assessments, 42 U.S.C.
     s2297g-1(g), was intended by Congress to be a limitation on the
     statutory applicability of the Special Assessments. The terms of
     this provision, entitled "Treatment of Assessment," do not purport
     to create an exemption or to address the scope of applicability of
     the Special Assessment. The terms and separate placement of the rate
     recovery provision reflect its separate purpose, namely, to allow
     utilities to pass through the costs of their Special Assessments.

     We note that the statutory structure contemplates that current
     ratepayers will bear costs related to fuels that benefitted
     ratepayers years earlier. Congress apparently recognized this as a
     potential ratemaking issue, and thus directed that the present
     ratepayers of the utilities that benefitted from the fuel use would
     pay the Special Assessments.

     Accordingly, because the EPACT contains no exemption from the
     Special Assessment for non-operating reactors, DOE has not exempted
     non-operating reactors in this final rule.

     H. Treatment of SWUs Sold to Another Domestic Utility at a Different
     Tails Assay in Calculation of the Special Assessment

     One commenter requested that DOE address how it would treat
     enrichment services that were purchased from DOE and subsequently
     sold to another utility at a different transaction tails assay that
     resulted in a net difference in SWUs.

     If a utility purchased DOE-produced SWUs from another utility, the
     purchasing utility's assessment will be based on the SWUs specified
     in contracts or other probative documents generated at the time of
     the secondary market purchase. The selling utility's assessment will
     be reduced by an amount that will be determined by the SWUs sold to
     the purchasing utility. For instance, in the event that the SWUs
     purchased in the secondary market transactions were less than the
     SWUs originally purchased from DOE, the selling utility will be
     assessed for the difference. If a transaction resulted in a net
     increase in SWUs, the purchasing utility will be assessed only for
     the amount of SWUs originally purchased from DOE; the selling
     utility's assessment will be reduced by the same amount. In general,
     where a secondary market sale resulted in a net difference in SWUs,
     there will be no increase or decrease, for Special Assessment
     purposes, in the total number of SWUs purchased from DOE. The
     Department bases this principle on its interpretation of EPACT,
     which requires Special Assessments to be determined on the basis of
     the total SWUs purchased from DOE by domestic utilities for the
     purpose of commercial electricity generation. To implement this
     requirement, DOE believes that secondary market transactions cannot
     be allowed to effect a net increase or decrease, for Special
     Assessment purposes, in the total number of SWUs that were purchased
     from DOE for all purposes. The following examples illustrate this
     principle:

     1. Utility A purchases 100 SWUs from DOE. Utility A's assessment
     would be based upon 100 SWUs.

     2. Utility A purchases 100 SWUs from DOE. Utility A sells this
     material to Utility B in a transaction based on the same calculated
     number of SWUs. Utility B's assessment would be based upon 100 SWUs.
     Utility A's assessment would be based upon 0 SWUs.

     3. Utility A purchases 100 SWUs from DOE. In a subsequent sale,
     Utility A changes the calculated SWUs and sells the 100 SWUs to
     Utility B in a transaction for only 80 SWUs. Utility B's assessment
     is based upon 80 SWUs. Utility A's assessment is based upon the
     remaining 20 SWUs unaccounted for in the secondary market
     transaction.

     4. Utility A purchases 100 SWUs from DOE. In a subsequent sale,
     Utility A changes the calculated SWUs and sells the 100 SWUs to
     Utility B in a transaction for 120 SWUs. Utility B's assessment is
     based upon 100 SWUs, and Utility A's assessment is based upon 0
     SWUs.

     Requests for assessment adjustments reflecting secondary market SWU
     transactions may be made pursuant to the requirements of section
     766.104. The liability for payment of the Special Assessment rests
     with the utility that originally purchased the SWUs from DOE, until
     such time that DOE makes a written determination granting or denying
     a requested adjustment pursuant to section 766.104(c). Such a
     determination must be based upon reliable and adequately probative
     information documenting the sale of the SWUs in question. DOE will
     use this information to reconcile its records of SWU purchases with
     both sellers and purchasers.

     I. Treatment of SWUs Traded or Loaned in Calculation of the Special
     Assessment

     One commenter requested that definitions for the terms "purchased"
     and "sold" be incorporated into the final rule, and that these terms
     be clearly defined to include enriched uranium trades and loans as
     purchases and sales.

     DOE has not included a definition of purchased and sold in the final
     rule because EPACT sufficiently describes these terms. The EPACT
     specifies that a utility is considered to have purchased a
     separative work unit from DOE if such separative work unit was
     produced by DOE, but purchased from another source; and a utility
     shall not be considered to have purchased a separative work unit
     from DOE if such separative work unit was purchased by the utility,
     but sold to another source.

     On a case by case basis, uranium enrichment trades and loans of SWUs
     will be considered for treatment as purchases for assessment
     purposes when probative and reliable documentation is provided under
     the reconciliation provisions set forth at section 766.104, and DOE
     determines that a particular trade or loan transaction constitutes a
     purchase pursuant to the requirements of the EPACT.

     J. Invoicing of the Special Assessment in Proportion to U.S.
     Congressional Appropriations to the Fund

     The EPACT specifies that the annual Special Assessment of domestic
     utilities "shall not exceed" $150 million of the total $480 million
     in annual deposits to the Fund. One commenter stated that the ratio
     (.4545) of the maximum amount of Special Assessments ($150 million)
     to the total amount of government deposits ($330 million) represents
     the maximum percentage of total deposits the utilities can be
     assessed in a given fiscal year. This percentage should be applied
     against the Federal Government contributions to the Fund to
     determine the ceiling for each annual Special Assessment of domestic
     utilities. For example, if the Federal Government contributes $100
     million in a given fiscal year, the utility contribution should be
     $45.45 million ($100 million x . 4545). The commenter contended that
     use of this capping method would make the domestic utility
     contributions to the Fund proportional to those made by the Federal
     Government and would eliminate the possibility of utility over-
     subscription to the Fund.

     EPACT authorizes the Department to collect a Special Assessment from
     domestic utilities up to $150 million per fiscal year without any
     requirement for proportionality between the Federal Government and
     utility contributions that are actually made to the Fund. Therefore,
     DOE will not impose an annually adjusted ceiling on the Fund or a
     requirement for actual proportionality between the two Fund sources.

     K. Payment Schedule for Future Assessments

     Several commenters expressed concern over the condensed payment
     schedule for payment of the Special Assessment in Fiscal Years 1993,
     1994, and 1995. These commenters contended that this payment
     schedule presents an unfair burden on domestic utilities, and may
     make it difficult for utilities to obtain full rate recovery of the
     Special Assessment.

     DOE accommodated this concern in the proposed rule in stating that
     "Fiscal Year 1994 invoicing will be postponed two quarters to
     accommodate the reconciliation of records." This delay also allows
     for more time between the Fiscal Year 1993 and Fiscal Year 1994
     Special Assessments. In addition, the EPACT affords utilities full
     rate recovery protection without regard to the timing of payments
     (42 U.S.C. s2297g-1(g)).

     L. Fixed Annual Date for Invoicing

     Several commenters expressed the need for a fixed date for invoicing
     of the Special Assessment to allow domestic utilities to plan for
     payment of the Special Assessment. DOE has modified the final rule
     to accommodate this concern. The final rule provides for annual
     invoicing of the Special Assessment on or about October 1 of each
     fiscal year with payment due 30 calendar days from the date of
     invoice, beginning with the Fiscal Year 1995 Special Assessment.

     M. Payment of the Special Assessment for Utilities Transferring All
     of Their SWUs to Another Domestic Utility

     One commenter recommended an exemption from payment of the Special
     Assessment for utilities that transferred, or plan to transfer,
     their entire portfolio of SWUs to other domestic utilities.

     EPACT requires the Special Assessment to be calculated on the basis
     of SWUs purchased from DOE prior to the date of enactment of the
     legislation. Therefore, domestic utilities shall be liable for the
     Special Assessment based upon SWUs purchased prior to the date of
     enactment without regard to potential or actual transfers of SWU
     portfolios, except that transfers that were a result of sales made
     prior to the date of enactment will be treated as adjustments to a
     utility's assessment during reconciliation, in accordance with the
     requirements set forth in section 766.104. See Section R.

     N. Submittal of Special Assessment Payment After Approval From
     Public Utility Commissions

     One commenter requested that utilities be allowed to submit their
     payments of the Special Assessment after regulatory approval is
     obtained from their public utility commission for rate recovery of
     these costs. There is no basis for such a contingency in the EPACT.
     The EPACT requires DOE to assess and collect an annual Special
     Assessment and provides for separate utility rate recovery of the
     assessments as a current cost of fuel. Making payment contingent
     upon a public utility commission's approval of Special Assessment
     costs could lead to undue delay in the collection of the Special
     Assessments and lost interest income for the Department. This delay
     could also cause DOE to risk violating EPACT by collecting more in a
     given fiscal year than the $150 million that is authorized, since
     DOE would lose control over the timing of collections. Therefore,
     DOE will not permit a delay in payment pending public utility
     commission cost recovery authorization.

     O. Establishment of a D&D Trust Fund Managed by the Domestic
     Utilities

     Several commenters requested that the annual Special Assessments,
     once collected, be placed into a Trust Fund to be managed by the
     domestic utilities. These commenters stated that such an arrangement
     would demonstrate prudence to rate regulators, and enable utilities
     to provide greater cost- control assurance to their customers.

     The EPACT requires that the Fund be established in the Treasury of
     the United States, and that amounts contained in the Fund be
     invested by the Secretary of the Treasury in obligations of the
     United States. (42 U.S.C. s2297g). Since the EPACT does not leave
     management of the Fund to DOE discretion, the Department cannot
     establish a utility managed trust fund.

     P. Payment of Interest on Credits to Future Special Assessments

     Several commenters expressed concern about the inability of domestic
     utilities to recover interest on any credits to future Special
     Assessments as a result of changes to utility Special Assessments
     from the reconciliation process. In the absence of specific
     authority, DOE cannot pay interest. The EPACT provides no authority
     for the payment of interest on credits or refunds made to utilities.
     However, DOE expects the majority of credits to Special Assessments
     to be completed in Fiscal Year 1994 as a result of the
     reconciliation process.

     Q. Method of Payment

     One commenter requested that DOE modify the final rule, which
     requires payment to be made by wire transfer, to allow domestic
     utilities to make payment of the Special Assessment by other
     electronic funds transfer methods. The final rule continues to
     specify wire transfer as the method of payment because this is the
     only electronic method accepted by the Department of Treasury. This
     method is consistent with payment methods already in use and
     familiar to domestic utilities. DOE is currently investigating the
     use of the Automated Clearing House method of payment with the
     Department of Treasury. Should this collection procedure become
     available, DOE may propose modification to this rule to reflect the
     change.

     R. Reconciliation Adjustments and Appeals

     Several commenters remarked that thirty days from the date of a
     Special Assessment invoice was insufficient time to file a notice
     requesting an invoice adjustment. One of the commenters recommended
     that DOE clarify the phrase in section 766.104(a) "* * * filing of
     the notice is complete only upon receipt by DOE." The commenter was
     concerned that this language could be construed to mean that filing
     of a notice is only complete when DOE deems the documentation
     supplied with such notice to be acceptable. DOE believes that thirty
     days is sufficient time to file a notice requesting adjustment. The
     final rule clarifies that domestic utilities are considered to have
     met the 30-day filing deadline upon receipt by DOE of the notice
     requesting an adjustment, and not contingent upon acceptance of
     supporting documentation by DOE. If more time is needed to gather
     probative information, DOE will consider utility requests for
     additional time, up to 90 days, to gather the necessary information
     based on a showing of need.

     One commenter requested that DOE provide guidelines for verification
     of transactions involving non-utilities and foreign utilities, and
     for the recalculation of utility assessments and the notification of
     changes in assessments. DOE does not believe that guidelines would
     be helpful for these purposes because the use of reliable and
     probative documentation, provided by selling and purchasing
     utilities and other sources, would be adequate and would provide
     flexibility in accomplishing the purpose of the reconciliation
     process.

     One domestic utility requested that DOE amend the Section-by-Section
     Analysis in the interim final rule to clarify that DOE is giving
     equal weight to the seller's and purchaser's documentation submitted
     in the reconciliation process. DOE has amended section 766.104 and
     the Section-by-Section Analysis to reflect this request.

     DOE has also amended the final rule to allow the Department to
     acquire probative documentation that may not reside with the
     Department or with a domestic utility, if the Department believes
     that such information would be useful for reconciliation of SWU
     records. During the reconciliation process, DOE will provide to the
     affected utilities the substance of any data obtained from other
     sources, but may withhold the source of the information consistent
     with applicable confidentiality requirements.

     One commenter was concerned that DOE had not provided for refunds of
     over- payments of Special Assessments. The final rule provides for
     refunds of Special Assessment payments in cases where it is
     determined that an over- payment has been made, with the exception
     of FY 1993 invoices. For FY 1993, DOE has already issued credits or
     refunds as appropriate.

     S. Prepayment of Special Assessments

     Subsequent to the comment period, one domestic utility requested to
     prepay future year Special Assessments. For convenience and
     expediency, DOE agrees to accommodate this request and has added to
     the final rule a new section 766.107 permitting prepayments.
     However, DOE will apply only the pro- rata share of any prepayment
     to a given fiscal year to ensure that the total Special Assessment
     for any fiscal year does not exceed $150 million (adjusted for
     inflation).

     T. Miscellaneous Comments

     One commenter requested that section 766.1 be revised to read as
     follows: "The provisions of this part establish policies applicable
     to administration of the Fund established by sections 1801, 1802,
     and 1803 of the Act as amended." DOE has revised the final rule to
     reflect this request.

     Another commenter requested that a definition for the term
     "delivery" be included in the final rule, asserting that unused SWU
     credits held by a utility should not be considered deliveries for
     purposes of determining the utility's SWU purchases. DOE does not
     believe a definition of delivery is necessary because it is relying
     upon the Toll Enrichment Services System (TESS), which is defined in
     the final rule. The TESS does not define the term delivery but
     includes data on SWU deliveries to domestic utilities. DOE intends
     to use TESS data in determining SWU deliveries for purposes of
     determining SWU purchases from DOE. As appropriate, DOE will modify
     the application of TESS data for any discrepancies or further
     transactions raised during the reconciliation process.

     One commenter requested DOE to insert the word "commercial"
     immediately before "electricity generation" in the definition of
     Domestic Utility. This comment is consistent with the EPACT, and DOE
     has revised the final rule to incorporate the change.

     Two commenters requested that the number of significant digits used
     in calculating the Special Assessment be specified in the final
     rule. The final rule has been modified to specify that five
     significant digits will be used in the calculation of the Special
     Assessment.

     In addition to the changes made in response to comments, DOE has
     also made a number of clarifying editorial changes in the final
     rule.

     U. Review Under Executive Order 12866

     Several commenters addressed DOE's decision not to consider the
     final rule as a major rule under Executive Order 12291 (recently
     replaced by Executive Order 12866). The commenters believe that the
     annual Special Assessment of $150 million appears to satisfy the
     criteria for a major rule, or in the case of Executive Order 12866 a
     significant regulatory action, having an effect of over $100 million
     on the economy. While the assessments to be paid by members of the
     electric utility industry will exceed $100 million annually, and may
     even be considered a major cost to the industry, these costs are not
     the result of any exercise of DOE's discretion in this final rule,
     but rather are specifically imposed by EPACT. After consultation
     with the Office of Management and Budget, DOE has determined the
     final rule is not a significant regulatory action.

     V. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act

     Many commenters stated that the final rule imposes an additional
     paperwork burden on the public, and that hundreds of hours have
     already been spent in additional paperwork in response to this rule.
     In consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), DOE
     has determined, under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. s3501
     et seq.), that the final rule imposes relatively minimal additional
     paperwork burden on the public. Therefore, DOE will not amend the
     rule's information collection requirements.

     IV. Section by Section Analysis

     A. Subpart A--General

     1. Sections 766.1 and 766.2 Purpose and Applicability

     Section 766.1 specifies that the purpose of this rule is to
     establish procedures for the Special Assessment of domestic
     utilities for the Fund pursuant to sections 1801, 1802 and 1803 of
     the Act. Section 766.2 describes the applicability of the rule,
     stating that it applies to all domestic utilities in the United
     States that purchased SWUs from the Department between 1945 and
     October 23, 1992.

     2. Section 766.3 Definitions

     Section 766.3 sets forth pertinent definitions applicable to PART
     766. DOE has added definitions for "commercial electricity
     generation" and "use and burnup charges."

     B. Subpart B--Procedures for the Special Assessment for the Uranium
     Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund

     1. Section 766.101 Data Utilization

     Section 766.101 identifies the records upon which the determination
     of the SWUs purchased for domestic, foreign, and defense purposes
     shall be based. An audit was completed on records in DOE's
     possession on July 19, 1993, by an independent accounting firm prior
     to initial billing. These records reflect all SWUs produced and
     delivered by DOE (or DOE's predecessor agencies) from 1945 to
     October 23, 1992. These records reflect initial production and
     delivery of SWUs, and do not reflect subsequent transactions
     involving DOE SWUs by domestic utilities. Accordingly, DOE may also
     use privately held, reliable, and probative records of SWU
     transactions. Access to DOE records is subject to generally
     applicable laws and regulations governing classified and sensitive
     unclassified information and materials. Requests for confidential
     treatment of business records submitted to DOE are subject to 10 CFR
     Part 1004.

     2. Section 766.102 Calculation Methodology

     Section 766.102 describes the method for calculating Special
     Assessments. It is based on the formula described in the text of the
     Act. The rule has been modified so that all calculations will be
     carried to five significant digits.

     3. Section 766.103 Special Assessment Invoices

     Section 766.103 addresses the billing of the Special Assessments.
     DOE issued Fiscal Year 1993 invoices in September 1993, along with a
     summary of supporting information as described in paragraph (b) of
     section 766.103. Under paragraph (c), DOE will issue similar
     invoices in future fiscal years and update supporting information as
     appropriate.

     4. Section 766.104 Reconciliation, Adjustments, and Appeals

     Section 766.104 outlines procedures that must be followed by
     domestic utilities when seeking adjustments of invoices. DOE
     anticipates that this procedure will be used most often with respect
     to the Fiscal Year 1993 Special Assessment as domestic utilities
     present records of secondary market SWU transactions for
     reconciliation of the allocation of SWUs. Following reconciliation
     of records, DOE will provide, in appropriate cases, refunds or
     additional assessments. Determinations under section 766.104 will
     serve as precedents, and may be the basis for summary determinations
     for repetitious claims filed in the years following Fiscal Year
     1993.

     During the administrative reconciliation process, each domestic
     utility will have the opportunity to question the allocation of SWUs
     that was the basis of the Special Assessment, and DOE will have the
     opportunity to adjust the allocation of SWUs based on probative
     information it obtains from other sources. In most instances,
     documentary evidence of SWU transactions, in the nature of resales
     or purchases of DOE SWUs from other sources, is in the possession of
     domestic utilities or other parties involved in the secondary
     market. Domestic utilities will be responsible for raising the issue
     of resales and purchases and should be prepared to respond to any
     questions regarding their records of resales and purchases; however,
     DOE may rely on information from other sources, if it is reliable
     and adequately probative of the transactions documented, to validate
     the content of utility records. DOE shall attempt to verify all
     claims with corroborating documentation provided by both the seller
     and purchaser. In order to obtain corroborating evidence, DOE may
     rely on its subpoena authority pursuant to section 161(c) of the
     Act. DOE may also seek relevant data from the Nuclear Regulatory
     Commission's NMMSS. DOE may give greater weight to documents that
     were prepared contemporaneously with the purchase or sale of SWUs,
     although other documentation will be considered. As appropriate, DOE
     will modify its application of TESS data for discrepancies and
     additional transactions raised during the reconciliation process.

     DOE considered the possibility of delaying the requirement to make
     payments until reconciliation of records is complete, but rejected
     such a procedure because the time required to reconcile records
     would have unduly delayed the program. This would have frustrated
     Congress's intention to establish the Fund expeditiously, and caused
     domestic utilities to encounter delays in obtaining appropriate rate
     relief.

     Section 766.104 also provides an administrative appeal procedure for
     domestic utilities to challenge an adverse determination by DOE on a
     Special Assessment. Appeals may be filed with the Office of Hearings
     and Appeals (OHA), a quasi-judicial body that reports to the
     Secretary of Energy. The OHA is responsible for conducting many of
     the informal adjudicative proceedings of DOE involving separation of
     functions. DOE chose OHA to conduct the appeals process because of
     its expertise in developing administrative records regarding
     economic issues. In connection with these duties, OHA holds
     hearings, receives evidence, develops a record, and issues a final
     determination, which is subject to review in federal courts. The
     procedures of OHA applicable to this rule are set forth in 10 CFR
     Part 205, Subpart H. DOE has revised the rule to clarify that it
     will rely upon decisions from the OHA and any ruling from courts
     with appropriate jurisdiction in revising records of SWU
     transactions.

     5. Section 766.105 Payment Procedures

     Section 766.105 provides that DOE shall specify the procedures that
     shall be followed by domestic utilities in payment of their
     apportioned share of the Special Assessment. Wire transfer is
     identified as the method of payment.

     6. Section 766.106 Late Payment Fees

     Section 766.106 addresses procedures for assessment of late payment
     fees in case of a late payment by a domestic utility of its special
     assessment.

     7. Section 766.107 Prepayment of Special Assessments

     Section 766.107 has been added to the rule to allow prepayment of
     future year Special Assessments.

     V. Review Under Executive Order 12866

     DOE has reviewed this final rule and, after consultation with the
     Office of

     Information and Regulatory Affairs within the OMB, determined that
     the final rule is not a "significant regulatory action" under
     Executive Order 12866, "Regulatory Planning and Review," (58 FR
     51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was not subject
     to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and
     Regulatory Affairs.

     Under one criterion of the Executive Order, a regulatory action is
     deemed significant if it is expected to have an annual effect on the
     economy of $100 million or more. It was determined that this
     criterion did not apply to today's action for the following reasons.
     While the money to be paid by members of the electric utility
     industry under the Special Assessment will exceed $100 million
     annually, these costs are not the result of any exercise of DOE's
     discretion in the rule. Rather, these costs are specifically imposed
     by the EPACT and reflect for domestic utilities their statutory pro
     rata share of costs related to the remediation and D&D of DOE's
     uranium enrichment facilities.

     VI. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act

     In accordance with section 605 (b) of the Regulatory Flexibility
     Act, 5 U.S.C. s601 et seq., DOE finds that sections 603 and 604 of
     that Act do not apply to this rule because it will not have a
     significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
     entities. This finding is based on a determination that the domestic
     utilities who will be assessed are not small entities.

     VII. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act

     The information collection requirements in this rule have been
     approved by the OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act and have been
     assigned OMB control number 1910-1400.

     VIII. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act

     This rule establishes procedures for the Special Assessment of
     domestic utilities for amounts that are to be deposited in the Fund.
     The Fund will be used to pay for the cost of D&D and remedial action
     activities at DOE's uranium enrichment facilities, and for the
     reimbursement of certain costs of D&D, reclamation, and other
     remedial actions incurred by licensees at active uranium or thorium
     processing sites, as specified in Title X of the EPACT.
     Implementation of this rule will not affect the legally required
     cleanup of the sites or result in any other environmental impacts.
     The Department has therefore determined that this rule is covered
     under the Categorical Exclusion found at paragraph A.6 of Appendix A
     to Subpart D, 10 CFR Part 1021, which applies to the establishment
     of procedural rulemakings. Accordingly, neither an environmental
     assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.

     IX. Review Under Executive Order 12612

     This final rule does not have a substantial direct effect on the
     states, the relationship between the states and the Federal
     Government, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among
     various levels of Government. No Federalism assessment under
     Executive Order 12612 is required.

     X. Review Under Executive Order 12778

     Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere
     to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations and
     reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in
     sections 2 (a) and (b), include eliminating drafting errors and
     needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation,
     providing clear and certain legal standards for affected conduct,
     and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also
     instructed to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the
     regulation clearly specifies any preemptive effect, effect on
     existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect,
     describes any administrative proceedings to be available prior to
     judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such
     administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. DOE certifies
     that today's final rule meets the requirements of sections 2 (a) and
     (b) of Executive Order 12778.
