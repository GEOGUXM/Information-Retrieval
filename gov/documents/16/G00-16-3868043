  Reference

   The library provides an array of up-to-date and innovative methods for
   assisting patrons in meeting their information needs. A professional
   library staff is available to answer reference questions and provide
   training on the use of the electronic and manual resources available in
   the library. Reference questions may be submitted by phone, fax, or
   e-mail.

  Literature Searches

   The reference staff in the library will perform searches on the
   hundreds of subject specific databases which are available to them
   through subscriptions to various vendors and on the internet. Searches
   can entail bibliographic verifications, author or cited reference
   searches, or comprehensive subject searches. Patrons may submit
   requests on a literature search form available in the library and on
   the homepage or by emailing or calling one of the reference staff.
   Search results can generally be received in the format of the patron's
   choice (emailed, downloaded to disk, or prepared in print).

  Library Seminars

   Periodically, the library conducts informational seminars on a variety
   of topics depending on patron needs and research interests. Past topics
   include searching the FirstSearch databases, demonstration of CD-ROM
   applications, and accessing electronic journals. Seminars are announced
   via the Library News & Announcements page.
