   The PLANTS Database is a single source of standardized information
   about plants. This database focuses on vascular plants, mosses,
   liverworts, hornworts, and lichens of the U.S. and its territories. The
   PLANTS Database includes names, checklists, automated tools,
   identification information, species abstracts, distributional data,
   crop information, plant symbols, plant growth data, plant materials
   information, plant links, references, and other plant information.
   PLANTS reduces costs by minimizing duplication and making information
   exchange possible across agencies and disciplines. This site is best
   viewed with Netscape or Internet Explorer version 4.0 or greater, with
   JavaScript, stylesheets, and frames enabled.
