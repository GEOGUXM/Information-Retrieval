                              About science.gov

   Science and technology impacts our daily lives. Recognizing that this
   creates an enormous demand for science and technical information by a
   very large population with diverse backgrounds, science.gov provides a
   gateway to information resources at the Federal science agencies. It is
   a unified navigation path to science done by the government, providing
   links to public information as well as other resources at the various
   government agencies.

   Science.gov fosters an open, collaborative environment. It is
   administered by the Science.gov Alliance, a group of agency
   participants committed to serving the information needs of the
   science-attentive citizen.

   The Alliance and the science.gov Web site were formed to improve and
   enhance access to information at existing science agency programs, in
   response to the April 2001 workshop on "Strengthening the Public
   Information Infrastructure for Science."

   Science.gov will encourage continued development, so check for new
   information frequently!
