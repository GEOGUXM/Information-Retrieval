   Green's Functions for Advanced Materials
   The Web site and Database of the GF/BEM group aims to foster
   communication and collaboration among the members. All those involved
   in research, teaching, or industrial applications of GF/BEM for
   materials are invited to join the group.

   [nist_s.jpg] Green's Functions (GF) along with the Boundary Element
   Method (BEM) provide a powerful tool for studying elastostatic,
   elastodynamic, electrostatic, and thermoelastic response of materials.
   New, computationally efficient methods for calculating Green's
   Functions for anisotropic solids have been developed at NIST and
   elsewhere.The NIST Center for Theoretical and Computational Materials
   Science has sponsored this project to develop GF/BEM formulation for
   advanced materials and to disseminate results for research, teaching,
   and industrial applications through Internet.

   Powerful computer codes for calculation and visualization of GF and BEM
   are available free to registered members of the group.
