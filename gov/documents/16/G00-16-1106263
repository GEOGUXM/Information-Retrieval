   Why Study Ice Cores
   [tour2t.gif]

   Tour Photo If you are interested in arranging a tour either for an
   individual or for a group, your first point of contact is the NICL
   Curator. He can be reached at 303-202-4830 or nicl@usgs.gov. Please
   have the following information ready when you call:
     * Number of people in the group,
     * Age Range
     * Preferred Dates (have a few in mind)
     * Preferred Time of Day

   Tour Photo We tailor each tour to the age range and size of the group.
   Our typical tour is in two parts; a 15-20 minute warm talk and a 15-20
   minute cold talk. If your group is larger than 10 people, it will be
   split into two smaller groups which will be toured simultaneously in
   reverse tour order. If you have a specific interest area, please let us
   know beforehand so that you can get the most out of your visit. We can
   supply warm clothing for small goups (less than 5 persons), but
   bringing your own jacket, hat and gloves is always recommended.
   Children should always bring their own warm clothing.

   Our normal hours of operation are 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through
   Friday. We observe all Federal holidays.
