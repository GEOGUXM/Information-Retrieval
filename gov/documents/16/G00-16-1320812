      Diversity
   [dotclear.gif]        The South Florida Water Management District
   recognizes and values equity and diversity -- in the communities it
   serves, and in all its projects and programs. [dotclear.gif]
          Employment is just one way the agency is working to reach out to
   diverse communities and people. [dotclear.gif]
          Similarly, the District also offers a number of different
   opportunities to high school and college students through internships.
   [dotclear.gif]
          Contracting and Procurement also offer opportunities to reach
   many of the talented individuals and companies from many different
   communities. [dotclear.gif]
          Through the Office of Equity in Contracting the District offers
   extensive outreach and support to historically underutilized businesses
   and works to ensure that the agency's supplier base equitably reflects
   the community it serves.
          Specialized Minority Outreach efforts include programs targeting
   the Hispanic and African-American communities. [dotclear.gif]
          At the same time, the agency is working to reach out to all its
   publics, through more traditional public affairs efforts including
   media relations (news releases, press conferences and press coverage);
   the production of publications and videos; the development and support
   of water resource/environmental education projects, curriculum and
   materials; and through speaking engagements and tours. [dotclear.gif]
          District Service Centers (in Fort Myers, Naples, Okeechobee and
   Orlando; and in Martin/St. Lucie, Broward and Miami-Dade counties, as
   well as in Big Pine Key) were created to increase outreach,
   communication and interaction with local communities and governments
   throughout the 16 counties within the boundaries of the District.
