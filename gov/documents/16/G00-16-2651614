   Supernova Cosmology Project) ABSTRACT The Supernova Cosmology Project
   has discovered over twenty-eight supernovae (SNe) at 0:35 ! z ! 0:65 in
   an ongoing program that uses Type Ia SNe as high-redshift distance
   indicators. Here we present measurements of the ratio between the
   locally observed and global Hubble constants, HL0 =HG0 , based on the
   first 7 SNe of this high-redshift data set compared with 18 SNe at z ^
   0:1 from the Cal'an/Tololo survey. If \Omega M ^ 1, then
   light-curve-width corrected SN magnitudes yield HL0 =HG0 ! 1:10 (95%
   confidence level) in both a \Lambda = 0 and a flat universe. The
   analysis using the SNe Ia as standard candles without a
   light-curve-width correction yields similar results. These results rule
   out the hypothesis that the discrepant ages of the Universe derived
   from globular clusters and recent measurements of the Hubble constant
   are attributable to a locally underdense bubble. Using the

   also measure the global Hubble constant, HG0 . If \Omega M * 0:2, we
   find that HG0 ! 70 km s\Gamma 1 Mpc\Gamma 1 in a \Lambda = 0 universe
   and HG0 ! 78 km s\Gamma 1 Mpc\Gamma 1 in a flat universe, correcting
   the distant and local SN apparent magnitudes for light curve width.
   Lower results for HG0 are obtained if the magnitudes are not width
   corrected. Subject headings: distance scale - supernovae:general 1.
   Introduction Some of the recent Cepheid measurements in galaxy clusters
   suggest a high value of the Hubble constant, 69 ^ H0 ^ 87 km s\Gamma
   1Mpc\Gamma 1 (e.g., Pierce et al. 1994; Freedman et al. 1994; Tanvir et
   al. 1995). However, if the cosmological constant is zero, such a large
   Hubble constant predicts an age of the Universe that is lower than the
   calculated ages of globular clusters (Bolte & Hogan 1995). To account
   for this discrepancy, it has been proposed that the locally (redshift z
   ^ 0:05) observed Hubble constant, HL0 , is actually higher than the
   global (z ? 0:3) Hubble constant, HG0 (Bartlett et al. 1995).
   Alternatively, it may be that these Hubble constant measurements lie on
   the tail of their statistical and systematic error distributions. We
   use our first sample of seven z ? 0:35 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to
   address both these possibilities, first by directly comparing our SN Ia
   sample with one lying within the local Hubble flow to determine the
   ratio of HL0 to HG0 , and then by using our sample (the first SNe
   observed in this redshift regime) together with SN Ia absolute
   magnitude calibrations to determine the value of HG0 . The possibility
   that HL0 =HG0 6= 1 has arisen in the context of the observation of
   peculiar velocity fields (e.g., de Vaucouleurs 1958; Dressler et al.
   1987; Lynden-Bell et al. 1988). Simulations of Turner, Cen, & Ostriker
   (1992) have shown that measured Hubble constants depend on the observer
   location and the depth of observations. Previous work by Lauer &
   Postman (1992) has constrained deviations from uniform Hubble flow to
   be \Delta H0=H0 ! 0:07 at 0:01 ^ z ^ 0:05 using brightest cluster
   galaxies as a distance indicator. The same sample of galaxies shows
   evidence for a peculiar motion of 689 km s\Gamma 1 with respect to the
   cosmic background radiation (Lauer & Postman 1994), although Riess,
   Press, & Kirshner (1995b) argue that SNe Ia at similar redshifts do not
   support this conclusion. We thus must still examine the possibility of
   a large scale (z * 0:05) peculiar velocity flow affecting all the local
   H0 measurements. The Supernova Cosmology Project has discovered over
   twenty-eight SNe in the redshift range 0:35 ! z ! 0:65 in a systematic
   search (Perlmutter et al. 1994; 1995). The peak - 3 - magnitudes of
   these high-redshift candles, when compared with the peak magnitudes of
   local SNe, can yield measurements of the cosmological parameters \Omega
   M and \Lambda (Goobar & Perlmutter 1995; Perlmutter et al. 1996b). This
   calculation implicitly assumes that the local SN calibrators lie within
   the global cosmological flow; i.e., that we do not live in a local
   bubble where peculiar velocities appreciably bias the observed value of
   the Hubble constant. In this paper we take an alternative approach,
   leaving \Omega M and \Lambda as free parameters and using our high
   redshift SNe Ia to measure the ratio between the locally observed
   Hubble constant and the global Hubble constant, HL0 =HG0 . We also use
   our SNe Ia to obtain a measurement of the Hubble constant. This can be
   compared to the other SN-based measurements which range from 57 km
   s\Gamma 1Mpc\Gamma 1 (Sandage et al. 1996) to , 66 km s\Gamma
   1Mpc\Gamma 1 (Hamuy et al. 1995; Riess, Press, & Kirshner 1996), and to
   the above mentioned Cepheid methods that connect distances in a
   sequence from a single galaxy, to the core of its cluster, and then to
   the Coma cluster. We use the first seven SNe from our search. A
   detailed description of our search methodology, the telescopes used,
   the photometric and spectroscopic data compiled for each event, light
   curve analysis, and a study of possible systematic uncertainties, are
   given in Perlmutter et al. (1996a,b). Specifically, we use the redshift
   as measured from the host galaxy spectrum, the best fit K-corrected B
   peak magnitude after our galaxy extinction correction mB = mR \Gamma
   KBR \Gamma AR, the value of \Delta m15 (Phillips 1993), and mB after
   correction to the Leibundgut template mf 1:1g B using the relation of
   Hamuy et al. (1996) as discussed in x2. 2. The determination of HL0
   =HG0 In order to use SNe Ia as a cosmological candle, we first must
   calibrate their luminosities. If the absolute distance to a SN is
   known, such as from Cepheids in the same galaxy, we can obtain the
   absolute magnitude M from the apparent magnitude m. More commonly, we
   can only measure the redshift and an apparent magnitude. From these
   quantities we can obtain the intercept M of the magnitude axis of the
   Hubble relationship, m = 5 log cz + M. (Following the notation of
   Perlmutter et al. 1996b, the script variable indicates a quantity that
   can be measured without knowing H0 or the absolute distance.) These two
   independent observables are related at low redshifts by the relation M
   = M \Gamma 5 log H0 + 25, where H0 is in units of km s\Gamma 1Mpc\Gamma
   1. We call M the "Hubble intercept" magnitude and we use it instead of
   M when studying relative values of the Hubble constant. - 4 - Progress
   has been made in determining both M and M using nearby supernovae. The
   Cal'an/Tololo Supernova Search has discovered and measured a large
   sample of SNe Ia within the local Hubble flow, from which a Hubble
   diagram with narrow magnitude dispersion can be produced and the Hubble
   intercept M fitted. The sample includes 18 SNe discovered no later than
   5 days past maximum with redshifts ranging from 3:6 ! log (cz) ! 4:5.
   (Of these, half are objects with cz ? 15000 km s\Gamma 1, beyond the
   distance of the Lauer & Postman (1994) galaxy cluster sample. However,
   they have magnitudes consistent with the SNe Ia at lower redshift.)
   Using these 18 supernovae, Hamuy et al. (1996) find MB = \Gamma 3:17
   \Sigma 0:03 with rms dispersion oe = 0:26 mag. Recent advances have led
   to a more detailed understanding of SNe Ia. A correlation between peak
   magnitude and light-curve shape has been found: Phillips (1993) and
   Hamuy et al. (1995) parameterize the light curve with the B-band
   magnitude difference between peak and 15 days after peak (\Delta m15)
   while Riess, Press, & Kirshner (1995a; 1996) characterize the
   light-curve shape by the amount (\Delta ) of a correction template
   needed to be added to a Leibundgut et al. (1991) template to get a best
   O/2 fit. These parameterizations within the Type Ia class, as well as
   those involving spectral features (Fisher et al. 1995; Nugent et al.
   1995), may make it possible to use the SNe Ia as a "calibrated" candle
   with B magnitude dispersions of ! 0:2 mag. The Hamuy et al. (1996)
   sample gives a linear relation between \Delta m15 and the magnitude of
   the supernova, which can be expressed in terms of the Hubble intercept:
   MB;corr = (0:86 \Sigma 0:21)(\Delta m15 \Gamma 1:1) \Gamma (3:32 \Sigma
   0:05): (1) This relation is used to "correct" observed SN magnitudes to
   a \Delta m15 = 1:1 standard template magnitude, Mf 1:1g B . Applying
   this correction reduces the rms dispersion to oe = 0:17 mag for the
   observed range of \Delta m15, between 0.8 and 1.75 mag. Not all SN Ia
   samples show a strong correlation between light-curve shape and peak
   magnitude. Sandage et al. (1996) cite the apparent lack of such a
   relation in the Cepheid calibrated SNe Ia to argue for the use of
   uncorrected "Branch-normal" SNe Ia - that is SNe with high quality data
   that pass a simple B \Gamma V color selection or have no spectroscopic
   peculiarities. This subset of SNe Ia has a low dispersion in B
   magnitude of , 0:3 mag (Vaughan et al. 1995). We therefore calculate
   HL0 =HG0 using both light-curve-shape corrected and uncorrected
   magnitudes. To measure HL0 =HG0 , we relate the locally derived values
   of the Hubble intercept and the high-redshift observed magnitudes using
   the standard Friedmann-Lema^itre cosmology. The expected peak magnitude
   of a SNe Ia at redshift z is a function of the mass density of - 5 -
   the universe \Omega M and the normalized cosmological constant \Omega
   \Lambda j \Lambda =(3H20 ) : mR(z) = MB + 5 log(DL(z; \Omega M ; \Omega
   \Lambda )) + KBR + 25 \Gamma 5 log HG0 (2) = MB + 5 log(DL(z; \Omega M
   ; \Omega \Lambda )) + KBR + 5 log(HL0 =HG0 ); (3) (e.g., Peebles 1993;
   Goobar & Perlmutter 1995) where KBR is the K correction relating B
   magnitudes of nearby SNe with R magnitudes of distant objects (Kim,
   Goobar, & Perlmutter 1996) and MB is measured in the local Hubble flow.
   Here we use DL, the "Hubble-constant-free" part of the luminosity
   distance, dL: DL(z; \Omega M ; \Omega \Lambda ) j dLH0 = c(1 + z)qj^j
   S`qj^j Z z 0 h(1 + z 0)2(1 + \Omega M z0) \Gamma z0(2 + z0)\Omega

   S(x) is defined as sin(x) and ^ = 1 \Gamma \Omega M \Gamma \Omega
   \Lambda ; for \Omega M + \Omega \Lambda ! 1, S(x) = sinh(x) and ^ as
   above; and for \Omega M + \Omega \Lambda = 1, S(x) = x and ^ = 1, where
   c is the speed of light in units of km s\Gamma 1. We use MB = \Gamma
   3:17 \Sigma 0:03 for uncorrected magnitudes, and MB;corr from Equation
   1 for light-curve-shape corrected magnitudes. For the high-redshift
   corrected SN magnitudes, mR, we use only the five SNe whose light-curve
   widths lie within the range (0:8 ! \Delta m15 ! 1:75 mag) of the local
   SNe from which the correlation was obtained: SN1994G, SN1994H,
   SN1994al, SN1994am, and SN1994an. The full sample of 7 high-redshift
   SNe is used when no correction is applied. Figure 1(a) shows the best
   fit values of HL0 =HG0 and the associated confidence interval curves
   for a range of \Omega M in a \Lambda = 0 universe, based on the
   light-curve-width corrected SN magnitudes. Figure 1(b) is the same plot
   as Figure 1(a) but for the case of a flat universe (\Omega M + \Omega
   \Lambda = 1). Note that the best fit curve is more steeply sloped than
   for the \Lambda = 0 case, increasing the variation in HL0 =HG0 in this
   \Omega M range. (The same plots for the seven uncorrected magnitudes
   are almost identical on this scale.) Also plotted for reference are the
   ratios of representative high and low Hubble constant values. Table 1
   has the single-tailed 95% confidence limits (C.L.) for HL0 =HG0 in
   \Lambda = 0 and flat universes using corrected and uncorrected SN
   magnitudes. The lower bounds are calculated at \Omega M = 0 where HL0
   =HG0 is a minimum. The value of HL0 =HG0 increases monotonically with
   respect to \Omega M , so to obtain an upper limit we choose an upper
   bound of \Omega M ^ 2. Note that the tabulated numbers are one-tailed
   95% C.L. limits, unlike the two-tailed confidence intervals given in
   Figure 1. As a cross check, we calculate results for "Branch-normal"
   SNe Ia with uncorrected magnitudes. Only SN1994G and SN1994an are
   confirmed "Branch-normal" based on their color or spectrum and the
   results obtained from them are statistically consistent with - 6 - 1.8

   from a single parameter fit; the uncertainties are calculated for each
   value of \Omega M .) - 7 - those of the full sample. In a \Lambda = 0
   universe, we obtain the limits HL0 =HG0 ? 0:79 and HL0 =HG0 ! 1:27,
   while for a flat universe we obtain HL0 =HG0 ? 0:68 and HL0 =HG0 !
   1:35. Generally we can calculate HL0 =HG0 for any \Omega M \Gamma
   \Omega \Lambda pair using Equation 3; we have performed this
   calculation for a grid of points in the plane from 0 ^ \Omega M ^ 2 and
   \Gamma 2 ^ \Omega \Lambda ^ 2 using the five corrected SN magnitudes.
   Figure 2 shows curves of constant HL0 =HG0 and associated uncertainties
   on the \Omega M \Gamma \Omega \Lambda plane as determined from these
   calculations. Given in parentheses on the same plot are the HL0 =HG0
   values for the same contours based on calculations from all seven
   uncorrected SN magnitudes. (The corrected and uncorrected contours do
   not have the exact same shape in the \Omega M \Gamma \Omega \Lambda
   plane, but their deviations are small within the scale of our plot and
   in comparison with our error bars.) Within the \Omega M \Gamma \Omega
   \Lambda region plotted, HL0 =HG0 = 70=50 = 1:4 is excluded to AE 99%
   confidence. This limit can still be lower if independent lower limits
   of the age of the Universe and \Omega \Lambda are included. In
   Perlmutter et al. (1996b), we discuss the potential errors due to
   Malmquist bias and host galaxy extinction. The bounds on those errors
   are small enough not to affect our results. 3. The Hubble Constant The
   measurement of the global Hubble constant HG0 , as opposed to the ratio
   of Hubble constants HL0 =HG0 , requires knowledge of the absolute
   magnitude M . The high resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope has
   made possible the discovery of Cepheids and measurement of their light
   curves in galaxies that have hosted well-observed SNe Ia. To date, six
   galaxy distances have been calculated to determine the peak absolute
   magnitudes of seven SNe, giving a weighted mean of MB = \Gamma 19:47
   \Sigma 0:07 mag with a dispersion oe = 0:16 mag (Sandage et al. 1996;
   Saha et al. 1994, 1995). Six of the seven SNe have a \Delta m15
   measurement from which we calculate the weighted mean of the peak
   absolute magnitude of SNe Ia corrected to \Delta m15 = 1:1 mag. Using
   the \Delta m15 vs. magnitude relation of Equation 1, we find M f 1:1g B
   = \Gamma 19:45 \Sigma 0:07 mag with oe = 0:14 mag. There is some debate
   on whether these SNe have been properly extinction-corrected and
   weighted. For example, Riess, Press, & Kirshner (1996) use the
   correction template method to conclude that SN1972E is significantly
   extinguished by its host galaxy. It has also been noted that the SNe
   measured with photographic plates give magnitudes that are
   systematically brighter than ones measured photoelectrically.
   Therefore, although we use - 8 - \Omega M \Omega \Lambda 0.0 0.5 1.0

   magnitudes are given in parentheses for the approximately corresponding
   contour. - 9 - all seven (six for the \Delta m15 corrected) SNe for our
   main results, we include for comparison results from the Riess, Press,
   & Kirshner (1996) analysis of the three SNe with photoelectric data
   that yields MB;\Delta =0 = \Gamma 19:36 \Sigma 0:1 mag for a \Delta = 0
   Leibundgut template supernova. Inserting the absolute magnitude MB =
   \Gamma 19:47 \Sigma 0:07 mag and the \Delta m15-corrected absolute
   magnitude M f 1:1g B = \Gamma 19:45 \Sigma 0:07 mag into Equation 2, we
   obtain useful upper bounds of the "global" Hubble constant HG0 , which
   are listed in Table 1. The bounds are calculated at \Omega M = 0 for
   \Lambda = 0 universes and flat universes because HG0 decreases with
   increasing \Omega M . If we take \Omega M * 0:2 we obtain even tighter
   limits, also given in Table 1. Figure 2 shows HG0 in the most general
   case, for different values of \Omega M and \Omega \Lambda . Note that a
   value of H0 as high as 80 km s\Gamma 1Mpc\Gamma 1 is only found for
   large values of \Omega \Lambda and low \Omega M . As a cross check, we
   again calculate our results for uncorrected "Branch-normal" supernovae.
   We then find HG0 ! 70 km s\Gamma 1Mpc\Gamma 1 in a \Lambda = 0 universe
   and HG0 ! 82 km s\Gamma 1Mpc\Gamma 1 in a flat universe. 4. Conclusions
   The measurement of cosmological distances using high-redshift SNe with
   locallycalibrated standard candles sets a limit on the differences
   between the local and global Hubble constants. From our analysis, it is
   clear that these data are inconsistent with scenarios that use a local
   bubble with high HL0 that differs greatly from HG0 . We also obtain an
   upper limit for the Hubble constant that is consistent with many of the
   other current measurements. However, limits that disagree with higher
   HG0 measurements may be obtained with independent upper limits on
   \Omega \Lambda . The SN Ia absolute magnitude calibrations are still
   subject to debate and may have systematic errors larger than the
   statistical ones given above, so it is important to ask how robust our
   results are. An uncertainty in the absolute calibration ffim in
   magnitudes propagates into ffiH0=H0 ss ffim. A 0.09 mag difference in
   the magnitude calibrations, such as the one between the \Delta
   m15-corrected absolute magnitudes for six SNe, M f 1:1g B = \Gamma
   19:45 \Sigma 0:07 mag, and that of Riess, Press, & Kirshner (1996),
   MB;\Delta =0 = \Gamma 19:36 \Sigma 0:1 mag, will produce a 10% change
   in either HG0 or HL0 =HG0 . There is little difference between
   magnitude corrected and uncorrected results for the ratio HL0 =HG0 ,
   but there is a systematic difference for HG0 itself, as seen in Table
   1. This is because both the light-curve-width distribution and the
   width-magnitude relation of our high-redshift sample are similar to the
   distribution and relation of the Hamuy et al. (1996) sample but not to
   those of the Sandage et al. (1996) sample. Although these differences -
   10 - may be due to selection effects, the small number statistics of
   the Cepheid-calibrated SN sample can also produce fluctuations that
   account for the differences. In Perlmutter et al. (1996b) we calculated
   \Omega M and \Omega \Lambda setting HL0 equal to HG0 , whereas in this
   paper we have discussed the measurement of HL0 =HG0 while leaving
   \Omega M and \Omega \Lambda as free parameters. Ideally one would like
   to measure both sets of quantities simultaneously. (This problem has
   been discussed in Wu, Qin, & Fang 1996.) Filling in a Hubble diagram
   with measurements of spatially well-distributed SNe should make it
   possible to decouple local and global streaming motions by showing
   redshift dependent deviations from the standard model, and allow one to
   measure \Omega M and \Omega \Lambda independently of local peculiar
   flows. Using SNe from redshift regimes with no evidence of flows, we
   can simultaneously fit HG0 , \Omega M , and \Omega \Lambda using
   Equation 2, thus producing a measurement of the Hubble constant. Our
   current data set, which spans from 0:35 ! z ! 0:5, shows no sign of
   peculiar flows but needs higher statistics and more complete spatial
   coverage to confirm this result. This work was supported in part by the
