         Welcome to our governmentwide awards calendar. It describes award
            programs sponsored by a variety of Federal and non-Federal
        organizations. The programs described in this calendar differ from
       those operated by Federal agencies only for their own employees. The
      programs listed in this calendar are open to employees from all Federal
       agencies. Federal employees seeking information about award programs
       designed only for their own agencies should consult their respective
                        servicing human resources offices.

         We include descriptions, nomination deadlines, web addresses, and
      contacts for each award. Awarding organizations will continue to issue
       individual announcements to solicit nominations and announce specific
       deadlines. For further information about these award programs, please
          phone or email the contact name we provide, or visit the award
                         program's web site, if available.

       If your organization operates a governmentwide award program that you
               would like to include on our list, please e-mail us.

      Two notes of caution:
             We have determined that agencies' participation in non-Federally
             sponsored honor award programs that have age or gender as
             selection criteria do not violate Federal statutes. However, we
             caution agencies not to consider the nomination or selection of
             their employees for those specific awards in making subsequent
             promotion or other decisions.
             Agencies should not nominate an employee for an award nor permit
             his or her acceptance of an award sponsored by any private
             organization having interests that may be substantially affected
             by the performance or non-performance of the employee's official
             duties.
