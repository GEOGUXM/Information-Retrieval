   [Randy_sm.jpg] Streamgaging in southeast Alaska is challenging, largely
   because of the logistics involved with transportation to the
   streamgaging site. The amount of field gear allowed in commonly
   determined by the space available in aircrafts. Transportation and
   using boats in remote locations is difficult, expensive, and sometimes
   dangerous. The use of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) has
   greatly reduced the time required to measure streamflow, although boats
   or rafts are still required for most measurements.

   The ADCP was introduced by RD Instruments of San Diego in 1996. The
   ADCP uses acoustical energy to measure the velocity vectors and depths
   within a stream to calculate discharge. The U.S. Geological Survey has
   adopted the ADCP as an accurate, efficient, safe, and cost-effective
   method to measure streamflow.

   On October 26, 1999, personnel from the USGS Juneau Field Office made
   successful streamflow discharge measurements on the Stikine River near
   Wrangell, Alaska (USGS station No. 15024800) using a Cessna 206
   amphibian floatplane and a 600-kHz "Workhorse Rio Grande" ADCP. The
   ADCP was attached between the pontoon floats of the Cessna 206 on a
   catamaran-type mounting system. Four transects were made taxiing the
   plane back and forth across the river perpendicular to the flow.
   Average transect length was approximately 1,100 feet and average time
   to complete a transect was 5.0 minutes with the total measurement time
   approximately 30 minutes. Discharge was measured at 71,800 cubic feet
   per second. In contrast, a standard discharge measurement on the
   Stikine River requiring a boat, outboard motor, hydraulics, sounding
   weights, a current meter, and a range finder, would have taken two
   people two hours to complete.

   Use of the floatplane and Workhorse Rio Grande ADCP is highly
   beneficial in hard-to-access areas. Several streamflow discharge
   measurements can be made on a few large river systems within one day.
   The dual use of the floatplane as a means of travel and as a vehicle to
   make streamflow discharge measurements reduces the amount of gear
   required. Having the aircraft remain on sites enables personnel to
   adjust to changing environmental conditions, thus increasing safety.
