   About OAL

     The Office of Administrative Law is responsible for reviewing
     administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state agencies for
     compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative
     Procedure Act, for transmitting these regulations to the Secretary
     of State and for publishing regulations in the California Code of
     Regulations.

     The office assists state regulatory agencies  through a formal
     training program as well as through other less formal methods, to
     understand and comply with the Administrative Procedure Act.

     The office issues advisory opinions as to whether a state agency
     rule meets the statutory definition of a "regulation" which must be
     adopted pursuant to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure
     Act.

     The office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and
     on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and the
     California Regulatory Notice Register.
