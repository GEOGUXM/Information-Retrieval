     __________________________________________________________________

   The DOT Mentoring Program is designed to give employees the opportunity
   to receive career guidance from role models from any organization or
   operating administration in the department and to subsequently help
   them reach their full potential. The Departmental Mentoring Program is
   open to all employees in the department, both headquarters and field.

   What is mentoring?

   The mentoring process links an experienced person (mentor) with a less
   experienced person (mentee) to help facilitate personal and
   professional growth in an individual by sharing the knowledge and
   insights that have been learned through the years. Mentoring is a
   strategy for comprehensive growth and development.

   What does it take to be a mentor?

   A mentor is one who is genuinely interested in people and has a desire
   to help others. A mentor is a listener, questioner, and advisor. While
   the mentor does not need to have all the answers the mentee may seek,
   he/she should be skilled in directing the search for answers. Other
   characteristics of an effective mentor are:
