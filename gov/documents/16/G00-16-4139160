   There are approximately 17,000 nursing homes in the United States
   caring for over 1.5 million older adults. Until the mid 1980s, nursing
   homes were one of the few housing options adults with disabilities had
   to help them manage activities of daily living. As a consequence of new
   housing options such as assisted living and community and in-home long
   term care services, the demographic profile of nursing home residents
   has significantly changed to a population which is older, more disabled
   and in greater need of medical attention. The following sites include
   information for the consumer including facility directories, statistics
   and research articles accessible on-line:
