   1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the
   telecommunications process of the NWS Marine Ship Report Program. This
   chapter does not cover ship data received by NWS on the World
   Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Telecommunication System.

   2. Description. Several means of telecommunications are employed to
   move ship weather observations from ships at sea to the NWS
   Telecommunication Gateway (NWSTG). Ships transmit their meteorological
   reports via radio or satellite. The reports are received by coastal
   radio stations for radio transmissions or coastal earth stations for
   reports sent by satellite. Both kinds of coastal stations relay the
   reports to the NWSTG via telex.

   3. Policy. The NWS is responsible for maintaining a meteorological
   watch of specified ocean areas adjacent to U.S. coasts in order to
   provide timely marine forecasts and warnings. To facilitate the
   meteorological watch, NWS has agreed to pay telecommunications costs of
   ship weather reports emanating from the following areas: Atlantic
   Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea West of 35째 W and North of 3째 N,
   and Pacific Ocean East of 160째 E and North of 25째 S. All reports for
   which telecommunications bills are paid must conform to WMO code form
   FM13-VII SHIP, Ships Weather Observations.

   4. Responsibilities. This section briefly describes the
   responsibilities of NWS Headquarters and ships that transmit ship
   weather observations.

       a. The Telecommunications and Dissemination Branch of the Systems
   Integration Division has overall responsibility for the following:

           1. Budgeting for ship report telecommunications costs;

           2. Maintaining a database of ships that provide reports in
   order to monitor satellite and telex costs, and verify ship
   telecommunications bills; and

           3. Maintaining agreements with companies that provide
   telecommunications for ship weather reports.

       b.    The Observing Systems Branch of the Systems Integration
   Division, through its Port Meteorological Officer Program, actively
   promotes the NWS Marine Ship Reporting Program and encourages regular
   reporting of weather observations by participating vessels.

       c.     Responsibilities for ship communications remain at the
   discretion of shipboard operators and are usually dictated by the
   equipment available. Types of telecommunications used by ships to send
   weather observations include:

           1. International Maritime Satellite Organization (INMARSAT)
   Standard A and Standard C satellite communications units;

           2. National Ocean Service provided SEAS, observation and
   satellite telecommunications units; and

           3. High frequency radio.
