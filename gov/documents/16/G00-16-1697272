        and times.

      PREFERENTIAL PARKING DISTRICTS

        In some areas of the City that are posted with limited parking (one-
        or two-hour zones) preferential parking districts have been
        approved. If you live in one of these designated areas, you may be
        exempt from this parking restriction by purchasing a preferential
        parking sticker. Stickers are available at City hall or you can
        download your application now (.pdf).
        __________________________________________________________________

      WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU VIOLATE A PARKING LAW?

        If you park illegally and receive a citation, read carefully and
        follow all instructions on the citation. Failure to submit payment
        within the required time may result in a penalty being added to the
        original fine and a hold being placed against your vehicle
        registration, or the vehicle may be towed.

        Once a citation has been placed against the registration with the
        Department of Motor Vehicles, the payment can be made when renewing
        registration or at Long Beach City Hall. For prompt posting of the
        payment, it is advisable to pay directly to the City of Long Beach.

        California Vehicle Code Section 22651 (i) gives authorization for
        the towing or booting of a vehicle when citations are issued and
        remain unpaid. Should your vehicle be towed for outstanding
        citations, you may contact the Parking Citation Section for
        information pertaining to the towing and amount due or go to the
        Towing Operations website. The vehicle must have current
        registration and all towing and storage fees must be paid prior to
        the release of the vehicle.

      How to Contest A Citation You Believe Was Issued Incorrectly

        If you wish to contest a parking citation, you must request a review
        within 21 days of the issuance date. The request for review may be
        made to the issuing agency by mail, by telephone or in person.
        Please note the telephone number provided on the face of your
        parking citation. (For the deaf and hard-of-hearing, please call TDD
        570-6693). You must indicate your reasons for requesting an
        Administrative Review and include copies of all supporting
        documentation (documentation will not be returned) relating to the
        citation, i.e., photographs, D.P. placard, ID card, permit holder
        information, etc. Please note, this Administrative Review process
        must be followed in order to contest a parking citation.

        Questions relating to the issuance of parking citations or the
        payment of a citation can be answered by calling the Parking
        Citation Section at (562) 570-6822, between 7:30 AM and 4:30 PM,
