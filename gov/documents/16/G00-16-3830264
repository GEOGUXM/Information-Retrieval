   California Secretary of State Bill Jones created the International
   Business Relations Program (IBRP) to develop stronger connections
   between the international business community and the State of
   California by educating and assisting foreign corporations about the
   various filing processes and procedures required in today's business
   world.

   Our goal at IBRP is to help you cut through the red tape and answer
   your questions about conducting business in the Golden State.

   How can the Secretary of State's International Business Relations
   Program help me?

   At IBRP we can:

     Provide you with general information about how to establish your
     business in California.

     Help you navigate through the maze of filings and procedures and
     facilitate filing requests to ensure accuracy and timeliness.
     * Make available to you our public information about existing
       California corporations and other business entities. (There is a
       nominal charge for this service. A fee schedule is available upon
       request.)
     * Track filing requests to ensure that they are being processed in a
       timely manner.

     Serve as an informal protocol office for international visitors,
     arranging tours of the Office of the Secretary of State and
     facilitating additional state government meetings.

   Below is a list of frequently asked questions here at IBRP.

     How does a foreign company file the documents for doing business in
     California?

     A foreign (out of state or country) corporation transacting
     intrastate business in the State of California must qualify to do so
     with the Secretary of State's Office. "Transacting intrastate
     business" is defined as entering into repeated and successive
     transactions of a corporations business in this state, other than
     interstate or foreign commerce. See Section 191 of the California
     Corporations Code. If you are unable to make a determination based
     upon the contents of Corporations Code Section 191, you will need to
     consult private legal counsel. The Secretary of States Office
     cannot provide legal advice concerning a corporation's need to
     qualify to transact intrastate business in California.

     What is an "Agent for Service of Process" and who can be such an
     agent?

     An agent for service of process is an individual (or another
     corporation) designated by a corporation to accept service of
     process if the corporation is sued. California residency is the only
     requirement for an individual to be named as an agent for service of
     process. A corporation named as an agent for service of process must
     have on file with the California Secretary of State a certificate
     pursuant to Section 1505 of the California Corporations Code.

       NOTE: A corporation cannot act as its own agent. Approval from a
     proposed agent should be obtained prior to designation.
