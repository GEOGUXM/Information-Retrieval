                                  City Newsletter

      Every once in a while, the City of Long Beach will send you via email
      the "City Newsletter" a text-only newsletter with current news and
      information briefs about the City.

      Our goal is to keep the newsletter quick and easy. Instead of supplying
      you with information about every new detail in the City (information
      overload to be sure!), each issue will simply contain useful citizen
      and visitor briefs that keep you up-to-date with activities in Long
      Beach. This is NOT a news service!!
