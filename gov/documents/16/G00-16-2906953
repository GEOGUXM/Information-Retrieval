       National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Aviation
     Accident/Incident Database

     Background

     The NTSB is an independent Federal agency charged by Congress with
     investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and
     significant accidents in the other modes of transportation --
     railroad, highway, marine and pipeline. Representatives from
     numerous federal, state and local authorities as well as various
     segments of the industry usually participate in the investigation of
     major accidents. The NTSB determines the probable cause of
     accidents, and issues safety recommendations aimed at preventing
     future accidents. The NTSB Accident/Incident Database is the
     official repository of aviation accident data and causal factors.

     In the NTSB database, an event is classified as an accident or an
     incident. "Aircraft accident" means an occurrence associated with
     the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any
     person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight and all such
     persons have disembarked, and in which any person suffers death or
     serious injury, or in which the aircraft receives substantial
     damage. The NTSB defines "Incident" to mean an occurrence other than
     an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft, which
     affects or could affect the safety of operations. The NTSB database
     contains only selected incident reports.

     Data is obtained using the following collection forms: NTSB Form
     6120.19A (Preliminary Report) and NTSB Form 6120.4 (Factual Report).
     A Preliminary report is to be completed within 5 working days of the
     event and a Factual report with additional information concerning
     the occurrence is available within a few months. A Final report,
     which includes a statement of the probable cause, may not be
     completed for months or after the investigation has been completed
     (it is not uncommon for the investigation of major accidents to
     require a year or more). Preliminary reports contain only a few data
     elements; i.e., date, location, aircraft operator, type of aircraft,
     etc. (they function as placeholders until the Factual and Final
     reports are entered into the database).

     Using the Database

     Things You Should Know

     The NTSB Aviation Accident/Incident database includes events that
     occurred between 1983 and the present. The data is presented in a
     report format that is divided into the following categories;
     Location Information, Aircraft Information, Operator Information,
     Narrative, Sequence of Events, Findings, Injury Summary,
     Weather/Environmental Information and Pilot Information. Since 1993,
     the NTSB also provides a full narrative to its electronic Factual
     and Final reports. This narrative is in addition to the information
     found in all electronic reports since 1983. To see the full
     narrative open a report and click at "Full narrative available."

   FAA Incident Data System

   Background

   The FAA Incident Data System contains incident data records for all
   categories of civil aviation. Incidents are events that do not meet the
   aircraft damage or personal injury thresholds contained in the NTSB
   definition of an accident. For example, the database contains reports
   of collisions between aircraft and birds while on approach to or
   departure from an airport. While such a collision may not have resulted
   in sufficient aircraft damage to reach the damage threshold of an NTSB
   accident, the fact that the collision occurred is valuable safety
   information that may be used in the establishment of aircraft design
   standards or in programs to deter birds from nesting in areas adjacent
   to airports.

     Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) Database

   Background

   The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) is a voluntary,
   confidential and anonymous incident reporting system. It is a
   cooperative program established under FAA Advisory Circular No. 00-46D,
   funded by the FAA and administered by NASA. Information collected by
   the ASRS is used to identify hazards and safety discrepancies in the
   National Airspace System. It is also used to formulate policy and to
   strengthen the foundation of aviation human factors safety research.

   Pilots, air traffic controllers, flight attendants, mechanics, ground
   personnel, and others involved in aviation operations can submit
   reports to the ASRS when they are involved in, or observe, an incident
   or situation in which they believe aviation safety was compromised.

   The FAA provides limited immunity from regulatory enforcement action to
   reporters as an incentive to report incidents. One stipulation is that
   a reporter must file a report within 10 days of the incident. The
   program protects the identity of the reporter and all other parties
   involved in an occurrence. The FAA may not seek and NASA may not
   release to the FAA any information that might reveal the identity of
   any party involved. NASA ASRS forms are distributed for operational
   personnel to use in reporting incidents.

   Within days of receipt and screening of an incident report, the
   reporter identification strip is removed from the reporting form, date
   stamped and returned to the reporter. The strip is proof that the
   reporter filed a report within 10 days of the incident. In many
   instances, analysts must contact the reporter, or "callback," in order
   to clarify the nature of the hazard or get additional information. In
   this part of the process the report is kept confidential. The report
   becomes anonymous when the strip is returned to the reporter. About
   400,000 incident reports have been submitted and no reporter's identity
   has ever been revealed by the ASRS. The database on this Web site
   contains reports received between 1988 and the present.

   ASRS also publishes a monthly Callback newsletter on safety hazards.
   NASA Internet services were established in November 1995, in an effort
   to make information widely available (Web site:
   http://www-afo.arc.nasa.gov/ASRS/).

   Using the Database

   Deidentification/Sanitization

   All identifying information is removed from the report before the data
   is entered into the ASRS database (aircraft make and model were removed
   until 1995). The data includes the reporters' narratives. These
   narratives provide a rich source of information for understanding the
   nature of hazards and human factors. The database also contains coded
   information from the original report, which may be used for analyses.

   Subjectivity

   The data received in an ASRS report represents what reporters
   communicate they saw or experienced. Except through the alert message
   part of the program, ASRS reports are not investigated, and therefore
   the accuracy of the reported information is not verified. The
   reporter's experience, visibility conditions, duration of the event,
   trauma experienced by the reporter or other factors can influence the
   accuracy of the data.

   For example, estimates by even senior pilots of how far aircraft
   descend during encounters with clear air turbulence often differ
   considerably from the actual distances recorded on aircraft flight data
   recorders. Also, reporters may be inclined to send in a report to
   minimize their culpability if they violated a federal regulation.
   However, this is becoming more the exception rather than the rule as
   more operational personnel gain confidence in using the program.

   Under-reporting

   Many factors can influence the decision to file a report, such as, lack
   of awareness of ASRS and motivation to report, which can differ
   considerably between different segments of the aviation community. For
   example, an airline pilot that believes he/she violated a regulation
   that could result in license suspension and subsequent loss of income,
   has more financial incentive to file an ASRS report than a recreational
   pilot involved in a similar violation. The perceived severity of an
   incident may influence the decision to report. The cumulative effect of
   these and other factors is that it is unlikely that ASRS reports
   submitted to NASA represent the total number of similar events that may
   occur and could be reported.

   For these reasons ASRS information should not generally be used to
   determine distributions or trends but may be very effective for
   identifying hazards, accident precursors and safety issues for further
   analysis

     Near Midair Collisions System (NMACS) Database

   Background

   A NMAC is an incident associated with the operation of an aircraft in
   which a possibility of a collision occurs as a result of proximity of
   less than 500 feet to another aircraft, or a report is received from a
   pilot or flight crew member stating that a collision hazard existed
   between two or more aircraft. A report does not necessarily involve the
   violation of regulations or error by the air traffic control system,
   nor does it necessarily represent an unsafe condition.

   Historically, a NMAC was classified as an incident and reports of NMAC
   events were maintained in the FAA's Incident Data System, together with
   reports of a variety of other events. By the mid-1980's, NMAC's were
   considered to be sufficiently important to warrant the establishment of
   a separate reporting system and investigative procedures. All NMAC
   reports are thoroughly investigated by FAA inspectors in coordination
   with air traffic controllers. Data obtained from NMAC reports is used
   to develop programs, policies and procedures to reduce NMAC occurrences
   and thereby enhance the safety and efficiency of the air transportation
   system.

   It is the responsibility of pilots and/or flight crew members to
   determine whether a NMAC actually did occur and, if so, to initiate a
   NMAC report. There is, however, no regulatory or legal requirement that
   a pilot and/or flight crew report a NMAC event, although they are
   encouraged to do so. The fact that pilots and/or crew members initiate
   NMAC reports raises two important issues for the user of this
   information. First, to some degree the data likely will be subjective.
   This necessitates that considerable caution be exercised when
   evaluating individual NMAC reports. Second, the number of NMAC reports
   filed probably will not represent the total universe of such events.
   Therefore, the use of this data to calculate NMAC rates by individual
   airline is unlikely to result in a metric that is a valid indicator of
   safety performance.

   Using the Database

   Things You Should Know

   The NMAC reporting system was revised substantially in 1992. Only
   reports submitted since that revision are available on this Web site.

   The geographic location of a NMAC is reported in terms of distance
   (nautical miles) and direction (degrees magnetic) from the nearest air
   navigation facility, airport or airway fix (VOR, NDB, airport, airway
   intersection). Those that occur in oceanic airspace are reported by
   latitude and longitude. Since several air navigation facilities
   frequently are located adjacent to airports, selection of an airport in
   the search criteria is unlikely to result in the retrieval of all
   reports that otherwise could be associated with that airport.

   Subjectivity

   The data received in a NMAC report represents what the reporter
   believes he/she saw or experienced. The accuracy of the reporting
   individual's perception of what occurred can vary considerably among
   the pilot/flight crew population, depending upon a variety of factors
   such as pilot/flight crew experience, visibility conditions, proximity
   of the aircraft involved, relative angle of approach, size of the
   aircraft involved, the trauma experienced by the pilot or flight crew,
   etc.

   For example, at higher altitudes, in the absence of visual reference
   points, even the most highly trained and experienced pilots may
   experience difficulty when reporting such critical information as
   missed distance, particularly when the NMAC encounter may have lasted
   only a fraction of a second. While one of the purposes of the
   subsequent FAA investigation of a NMAC report is to remove as much
   subjectivity as possible through verification of the information
   contained in the pilot/crew member report, the investigator's ability
   to verify this information may be very limited; e.g., if the location
   of the NMAC event is outside air traffic control radar coverage,
   precise verification of missed distances is a formidable task.

   Under-reporting

   The submission of a report of a NMAC event can be influenced by many
   considerations. Pilot experience and the operational environment they
   routinely fly in can influence reporting. Pilots that routinely fly in
   heavily used airspace and are familiar with operating in relatively
   close proximity to other aircraft may consider an encounter of this
   type to simply be a part of the operational environment and not
   something that merits reporting, whereas a pilot that usually flies in
   sparsely used airspace and is unfamiliar with operating in close
   proximity to other aircraft may consider the same event to be an
   extremely serious event that urgently must be reported.

   Past reporting trends also suggest that the motivation to report is at
   least in part influenced by pilot perception that the reporting of NMAC
   events contributes to aviation safety and therefore is worth the time
   and effort required to file a report. Following a NMAC event that
   receives widespread media attention, there is a tendency for the number
   of reports filed initially to increase, sometimes substantially, and
   then to decline over time to near previous levels. Fear of a potential
   FAA penalty or even attitudes that pilots and flight crews hold about
   governmental institutions can influence a decision whether to file a
   NMAC report.

   Some NMACs, including those which may involve unsafe conditions may not
   be reported either because of lack of awareness of the NMAC reporting
   system or the fact that the flight crew simply did not see the other
   aircraft due to restricted visibility. The cumulative effect of all
   these factors that influence the submission of a report is that it is
   highly unlikely the NMACs reported to the FAA represent the total
   universe of these events.

     NTSB Safety Recommendations to the FAA with FAA Responses

   Background

   NTSB uses the information it gathers during accident investigations and
   the determination of probable cause to make safety recommendations to
   all elements of the transportation industry. While the recipient of a
   recommendation does not have to implement the proposed action, it does
   have to formally respond to the recommendation and specify what action
   is or is not being taken and why. This database contains NTSB's
   recommendations to the FAA and the FAAs responses. It does not contain
   recommendations to other elements of the air transportation industry
   nor other modes of transportation. It is an historical record of
   correspondence between the NTSB and the FAA.

   NTSB Safety Recommendations database includes recommendations that were
   written between 1963 and the present.

   Using the Database

   Things You Should Know

   The NTSB Safety Recommendations are stored in a textual database. The
   recommendations are presented in a brief report format along with

   Bureau of Transportation Statistics - Airline Traffic Statistics

   Background

   The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) is an operational unit of
   the United States Department of Transportation. BTS compiles, analyzes
   and makes accessible information on the Nation's transportation system.
   The major United States airlines are required by Federal regulation to
   provide specific financial, activity and descriptive data to BTS. This
   and other data are used to develop information on the extent, use,
   condition, and performance of the Nation's air transportation system.

   The airline activity spreadsheet available on the Aviation Safety
   Information Web site contains selected airline activity measures
   extracted from the BTS system. Specifically, it contains, by airline,
   the number of departures, flight hours and miles performed in domestic
   commercial service during the most recent five calendar years. These
   are the activity measures that are used most frequently by government
   and industry to calculate accident or incident rates for the principal
   segments of the air transportation system. The spreadsheet currently
   contains activity for airlines that operate only aircraft with thirty
   or more seats. To obtain activity data for all airlines contained on
   this website, click to download an EXCEL 5.0 spreadsheet, download a
   .CSV file, or view a document of BTS Airline Traffic Statistics. (Some
   applications used for computations may not accept commas in numbers. It
   may be necessary to remove commas from BTS activity numbers prior to
   pasting into these applications.)

   Cautions About The Analysis Of Aviation Safety Data

   Broad Definition: The definition of an aviation accident is very broad.
   It can involve events that range in severity from a flight attendant
   receiving a broken ankle as a result of an aircraft encounter with
   turbulence at altitude, to the catastrophic loss of one or more
   aircraft and hundreds of lives. In order to give more meaning to
   accident counts, governmental authorities traditionally have
   categorized accidents as fatal and non-fatal. However, even this
   categorization can be misleading; e.g., the death of a ramp agent
   resulting from the push back of an aircraft from the airport gate still
   would be classified as an aviation accident. The aviation insurance and
   aircraft manufacturing industries have taken an alternative approach to
   this issue by categorizing accidents as "hull (aircraft) loss" and
   "non-hull loss". Recently, the National Transportation Safety Board
   introduced a new categorization system that divides accidents into
   either "Major, Serious, Injury, or Damage".

   Accident Rates: Accident counts alone are not reliable indicators of
   the relative safety of airlines/operators, aircraft types, or segments
   of the air transportation industry because, all other things being
   equal, an airline with 500 airplanes will probably have more accidents
   than an airline with 10 airplanes. Similarly, the more frequently used
   aircraft types would tend to be involved in accidents more than the
   less frequently used types. The method most commonly used to address
   these issues is to calculate accident rates in terms of accident counts
   divided by some measure of aviation activity; i.e., accident counts
   divided by flight hours, departures, miles, etc. This is the
   methodology the NTSB uses to compare the historical accident record of
   the principal segments of the air transportation industry.

   Statistical Bias: No two airlines fly identical aircraft fleets on
   identical routes. Some tend to fly larger aircraft on long routes while
   others fly smaller aircraft more frequently on shorter routes. Because
   more accidents occur during takeoff and landing than during other
   phases of flight, the selection of the measure of aviation activity
   that is used to calculate rates will bias the results. For example, an
   airline that flies longer routes has fewer takeoffs and landings per
   hour and is thus favored by use of hours as the measure of activity,
   while an airline that flies shorter routes is favored by the use of
   departures as the measure of activity.

   Time Issues: The aviation industry is characterized by rapid change.
   Whereas airline operations once were characterized by point-to-point
   service, hub and spoke service now dominates the industry. In addition,
   the airline industry experienced a major consolidation through mergers
   and bankruptcies during the past fifteen years. Airline activity has
   nearly doubled over that period. New technologies are constantly being
   introduced, such as aircraft collision avoidance systems. Overall, the
   aviation industry of 1999 is very different from the industry in 1982.
   Because of the dynamic nature of the aviation industry, care must be
   exercised to avoid comparing conditions or events spanning several
   years. This raises the issue as to what is the appropriate time frame
   to use when engaging in aviation safety analysis. While there is no
   definitive answer to this issue, the federal government frequently uses
   the most recent five or ten years in its safety analysis and monitoring
   programs.

   Ranking Airline Safety Performance: Airline accidents are very rare
   events and the risk of death or serious injury for air travelers is
   exceedingly small. Professor Arnold Barnett of the Massachusetts
   Institute of Technology, using data from 1990 to the present, has
   calculated that a passenger faces a death risk of one in eight million.
   "Stated somewhat differently, if a passenger facing a death risk of one
   in eight million were to choose one flight at random each day, that
   passenger would, on average, go for 21,000 years before perishing in a
   fatal crash."

   During the past decade, the large United States airlines as a group
   have experienced on average, one and one-half to two catastrophic
   accidents a year. The rarity of these events raises a number of
   statistical problems associated with the use of small numbers for
   analysis purposes. Because of these problems, it is difficult to
   compare the aggregate safety of the airline industry, even over time.
   For example, a recent report prepared for the FAA by GRA, Inc. entitled
   A Report on Issues Related to Public Interest in Aviation Safety Data,
   found that :

          "... there currently is no evidence in accident data that would
          support the ranking of individual airlines based on their safety
          records, at least not for U.S. domestic air carriers (airlines).
          While there may be apparent differences in carrier safety
          records at any particular time, due largely to the infrequent
          but catastrophic nature of an air accident, there is no evidence
          that such distinctions persist nor that they are predictive of
          future safety performance. Rankings of airlines based on past
          accident records therefore provide no information to consumers
          seeking to make safety-enhancing comparisons for current or
          future travel choices."

   Hints About How To Use This Data

   Types of Search

   Textual search across all data fields is provided for all databases
   containing narrative information. Identifying additional information
   prior to the search can narrow the search: Report Number, Start/End
   Dates, Aircraft Make/Model and Operator/Airline because, in general,
   searches using just the text search box will not return the same number
   of records as searches conducted using the additional fields on the
   query screen. This result is because the text search box searches for
   all occurrences of a word or string throughout the report, whereas a
   field on the search form is tied to a single field on the report. For
   example, a search for the word "taxi" may return accidents involving
   "air taxi" (on demand air carrier) operations as well as incidents
   occurring while an aircraft was "taxiing" (moving on the airport
   surface) to an airport gate or runway, or events involving a certain
   "taxiway" that connects the gate to the runway. The "Help" function on
