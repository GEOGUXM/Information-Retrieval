   Paynes Prairie is a large freshwater marsh located in southern Alachua
   County, Florida.  Most of the marsh lies within Paynes Prairie State
   Preserve. The Prairie supports a great diversity of wildlife including
   wading birds, alligators, snakes, frogs, and small mammals. There are
   even wild horses and bison within the PreserveÂ´s boundaries.
   Today, the Prairie is transected by two major north-south highways,
   U.S. 441 and Interstate 75.  U.S. 441 was built in the 1920's and has
   become a major thoroughfare for commuters. More than 10,000 cars use
   the road each day. Wildlife mortality is especially high on the 2 mile
   stretch of U.S. 441 across the Prairie.   Snakes and frogs frequently
   fall victim to the automobile. Birds, small mammals, and alligators are
   also killed in significant numbers. Due to the location of the road and
   the high volume of daily traffic, U.S. 441 has been considered by many
   to be one of Florida's deadliest roads.

   The Project
   In 1998, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) convened a
   multidisciplinary working group to discuss methods of reducing wildlife
   mortality on U.S. 441 across Paynes Prairie. With input from the
   working group, FDOT engineers designed a system of barrier walls and
   underpasses (called an Ecopassage) to be placed along the two mile
   section of U.S. 441 across the Prairie. The Ecopassage was designed
   specifically to reduce road mortality of reptiles, amphibians, and
   small mammals. See Federal Department of Transportation US 441 Project
   and Federal Department of Transportation Critter Crossings for details
   on the design of the Ecopassage.
   In addition to the construction of the barrier/underpass system, FDOT
   is funding a study that will evaluate the effectiveness of the
   Ecopassage. The two-part study is being conducted by biologists with
   the U.S. Geological Survey-FCSC. The pre-construction study (SIS doc.
   3203), which took place from August 1998 through August 1999 allowed
   researchers to document pre-construction wildlife mortality levels
   (Phase I Final Report). Once the Ecopassage is in place, U.S.
   Geological Survey biologists will conduct a post-construction survey to
   determine whether the Ecopassage is effective in reducing wildlife
   mortality. In addition to documenting wildlife mortality levels,
   researchers also are monitoring use of the culverts by wildlife
   (Culvert photos). Twenty-eight species were documented using the
   existing culverts during the pre-construction study. The
   post-construction phase of the study, to evaluate the effectiveness of
   the Ecopassage, is scheduled to begin before the end of the year.
   The Paynes Prairie Ecopassage is the prototype of a system designed to
   reduce wildlife mortality and to allow small vertebrates safe passage
   under the roadway. If the design proves effective, this project may
   guide future highway design in critical wildlife areas nationwide.
