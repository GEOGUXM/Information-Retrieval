                            Freedom Of Information Act
           Serving the information needs of a country and its veterans.

   "A popular Government without popular information or the means of acquiring
   it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy or perhaps both. Knowledge will
   forever govern ignorance, and a people who mean to be their own Governors,
   must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives."   -James Madison

      In the spirit of President Madison, we welcome you to the VA Freedom of
      Information Act Home Page. The 1996 amendments to the Freedom of
      Information Act (FOIA) mandates that each Federal agency implement a
      publicly-accessible Electronic Reading Room of agency FOIA response
      material and other material routinely available to the public, with
      associated electronic "search" and indexing capabilities. VA's
      Electronic Reading Room uses a library metaphor to welcome our
      customers to the VA Web site. However, to serve those with bandwidth
      limitations or special needs, we offer an alternate presentation in
      standard text with minimal graphics and effects. We hope you enjoy your
      visit here and come back often.
