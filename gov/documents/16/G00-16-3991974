                              AWIPS/WFO LAPS Page

   The purpose of this page is to describe the major differences between
   the WFO LAPS release and the more general LAPS that is described on
   FSL's LAPS branch web pages.  Progress on LAPS improvements and bug
   fixes relevant to AWIPS are outlined. This page also provides specific
   links to other information sources that may be of use to the WFO/AWIPS
   LAPS application.

   AWIPS LAPS runs using NOAAPORT (nationally distributed) and LDAD
   (locally distributed) data that has generally been translated into
   NetCDF on the AWIPS platform for use by the LAPS ingest processes.

Data Issues:

     * Ingest Flow Chart [slide2_small.gif]
       The blue colored data are what we are using in AWIPS LAPS. The
       other data are being used in our "full-blown" LAPS and can
       potentially be added to AWIPS/LAPS if the data becomes available.
     * Surface: We are using METARS for the surface observations. LDAD and
       Maritime surface observations are also being used if available.
       There are some deficiencies in 'obs_driver.x', partly related to
       time windows, that cause only around 10% of the available LDAD data
       to make it into LAPS. We have fixed this for version 5.1.2. Surface
       observations from mesonet, wind profiler, and GPS stations should
       all be getting into the surface LDAD files. The data paths for
       surface data are specified in 'nest7grid.parms' prior to 5.1.2 and
       'obs_driver.nl' for 5.1.2 and later. There are three separate paths
       for METAR, LDAD, and Maritime files. Surface observations are now
       used from a time window between 15 minutes before and 15 minutes
       after the top of the hour.
     * Background: We are using the RUC model as the default background,
       with a failover to Eta if RUC is not available. Some coastal sites
       may be better served by using Eta for the default; this can
       probably be done on-site by editing the 'background.nl' namelist
       file.
     * Satellite: The satellite interface for AWIPS depends on (8-bit)
       image data only, (those acquired via the Satellite Broadcast
       Network).  The satellite interface in "regular" LAPS is capable of
       this plus interfacing to GVAR full resolution image data (10-bit)
       and sounder radiance data (13-bit). More information regarding
       AWIPS satellite application can be found here.
       In terms of the analyses, the IR image data feeds into the cloud
       analysis as well as the surface temperature analysis. The VIS data
       (used in clouds and snow cover) is currently inactive pending
       further calibration efforts.
       LAPS Satellite ingest processes the image closest to the top of the
       hour, up to a range of H-15 to H+15 minutes.
     * Radar: The LAPS VAD wind interface (ingest_vad.exe) is currently
       inactive.
       The presence or absence of reflectivity data affects the cloud
       analyses and precipitation estimates. The absence of Doppler
       velocity data affects the quality of the 3-d wind analysis.
       We are currently utilizing low-level radar reflectivity data
       (Level-III RPG) for input into LAPS. The strategy is to process
       low-level reflectivity data in polar form into a NetCDF file that
       is readable by the LAPS ingest program 'remap_polar_netcdf.exe'.
       Ideally we prefer full volume (or layer composite) radar data for
       LAPS, though LAPS can function to a degree with the
       two-dimensional, single-radar input.
       LAPS uses the low-level tilt scanned closest to the top of the
       hour, up to a range of H-20 to H+20 minutes.
       In the future, we hope to use multiple radars. Towards this end a
       new mosaicing executable will be developed as part of the LAPS
       suite to combine individual 'vrc' files generated for each radar
       using 'remap_polar_netcdf.exe' into a composite 'vrc'.
       To improve ground clutter rejection, we hope to use either the DHS
       (Digital Hybrid Scan), or multiple low-level tilts.
       In the more distant future, wideband (Level-II) reflectivity and
       velocity data would be attractive for use in AWIPS/LAPS.
     * Wind Profiler/RASS: We are currently interfacing to the WFO
       profiler data (WPDN 404 MHz network) via 'ingest_pro.exe'. Profiler
       data will be read in from the current hour's NetCDF file, if that
       file is created by :25 past the hour. If the file arrives later
       than :25 after then no profiler data gets in. The boundary layer
       915 MHz profiler network interface is inactive. The RASS ingest
       also is inactive (ingest_lrs.exe). These can be activated if
       appropriate NetCDF data becomes available in the AWIPS database.
     * ACARS/Pireps: The interfaces to acars (ingest_acars.exe) and pireps
       (ingest_pireps.exe) are inactive for now. These can be activated if
       NetCDF data becomes available in the AWIPS database. One method of
       obtaining this data might be to use the FSL ACARS Web site, which
       is designed for downloading ACARS NetCDF data.
     * RAOB: The interface to RAOB data (ingest_raob.exe) is being
       activated for verstion 5.2.2. RAOBs are only available sporadically
       so most hours LAPS runs would not see them being used within the
       +/- 1 hour data cutoff.

Analysis Issues:

   An overall description of analysis processes is in Section 3.3 of our
       README file.
     * Helicity: LAPS helicity is calculated as a mean value through the
       column, (i.e. "integrated helicity") over 0-3 km AGL. This is what
       most of the community uses.
       For additional information, see our README file in the section on
       "deriv.exe". The README document discusses the newest version of
       helicity, while the paper on the LAPS Wind Analysis mentioned
       therein discusses an older version.
       Note that LAPS helicity may differ from that given by the Skew-T
       program since the assumed storm motion is somewhat different. We
       are considering changing the LAPS storm motion algorithm to use
       Bunkers et. al. or some other more "standard" method to help ensure
       consistency with other helicity calculations in AWIPS.
     * Lifted Index:
       There are two LI selections on the workstation. LAPS LI is a
       regular LAPS product (in the LAPS big file). It is computed from a
       surface parcel taken from the LAPS T and Td sfc analyses. Surface
       (terrain following) pressure and 500mb temps are also taken from
       LAPS.
       Computed LI is an intrinsic on the fly workstation function that
       calculates LI from the state LAPS variables.
