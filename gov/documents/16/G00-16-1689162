                      NMFS Employee of the Year Awards


   In October, 2001, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) created
   as series of annual Employee of the Year Awards. These awards recognize
   employees that have made significant contributions to NMFS programs and
   mission. Five award categories were created to ensure that all levels
   of service are recognized:
     * Management or Supervisory;
     * Professional (Grades 13 and above/Pay Bands IV/V);
     * Professional (Grades 12 and below/Pay Bands below IV);
     * Administrative/Technical/Support Service; and
     * Clerical/Secretarial.

   Employees are nominated by their fellow co-workers for their
   achievements, and up to 5 NMFS employees are recognized from each NMFS
   Center.
