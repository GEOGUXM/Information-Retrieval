   NASA's Information Technology Research
        __________________________________________________________________

      In order to meet its aeronautics and space mission goals and
      objectives, NASA is organized into five strategic enterprises:
      Aerospace Technology, Earth Science, Human Exploration and Development
      of Space, Space Science, Biological and Physical Research.

      Information Technology (IT) plays a key role in all of these
      enterprises by providing capabilities that support the three
      cornerstones of NASA's Information Technology research:

        Automated Reasoning for Autonomous Systems

        Automated reasoning for autonomous systems will enable aerospace
        vehicles to achieve unprecedented levels of autonomy in their
        operations and mission objectives. By utilizing on-board planners
        and executives to reduce mission and operational costs, for example,
        it will be possible to greatly decrease the amount of human effort
        currently required to plan, schedule and execute detailed sequences
        of vehicle commands.

        Human-Centered Computing

        The goal of human-centered computing research is to extend human
        capacity through novel utilization of human/computer interactions
        and data analysis. This will be accomplished by research that will
        enhance our ability to make use of the scientific data obtained
        through various experiments and tests, as well as data returned to
        Earth from distant spacecraft. Data analysis techniques and remote
        collaborative tools are enabling researchers and scientists to
        exchange information and share remote access to facilities in high
        demand, such as astronomical observatories and wind tunnels.

        High-Performance Computing and Networking

        All of the automated reasoning, human-centered computing research,
        and technology development and implementation indicated above
        requires very high-performance computing and networking systems.
        This, in turn, requires the development of a distributed,
        heterogeneous computing capability, including mass storage, data
        management, and analysis systems that enable these complex aerospace
        science computations.
