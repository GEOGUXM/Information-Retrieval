    1. General
         1. Define what you mean by "IP".
            "IP" stands for Internet Protocol. Strictly speaking, this is
            a layer 3 (networking) protocol that is only concerned with
            end-to-end network addressing. However, when speaking
            generally, the term "IP" is oftern used to refer to the entire
            suite of Internet protocols, including TCP, UDP, FTP, NTP,
            SMTP, etc., and not just the network layer protocol.
         2. What do you mean by "layers"?
            "Layers" refers to a set of Open Systems Interconnect (OSI)
            network services that was originally defined by ISO in the mid
            1980's. Each layer has a well defined subset of services it
            provides to the layer above, and a well defined interface to
            the layers above and below. The OSI model had 7 layers, but as
            the Internet evolved, layers 5 and 6 were rarely used.
            The layers are:
               o Layer 7: Application Layer
                 High-level protocols that use lower layer services.
                 (FTP, Telnet, SMTP, NFS, DNS, SNMP)
               o Layer 6: Presentation Layer - not generally used
               o Layer 5: Session Layer - not generally used
               o Layer 4: Transport Layer
                 End-to-end stream multiplexing Protocols.
                 (TCP - reliable byte-stream delivery, UDP - unreliable
                 packet delivery)
               o Layer 3: Network Layer
                 End-to-end addressing, packet routing, simple packet
                 forwarding.
                 (IP, RIP, OSPF, IGRP, BGP)
               o Layer 2: Data Link Layer
                 Data unit delivery across a single data link, data unit
                 framing, link level addressing.
                 (Ethernet, HDLC, ATM, PPP, SLIP)
               o Layer 1: Physical Layer
                 Physical media and signal levels. coding specifications,
                 bit-level operations.
                 (10baseT, RS-422, UTP, Reed-Solomon)
         3. Doesn't IP fail in space due to long propagation delays?
            This is a misconception that is brought about by confusing IP,
            a layer 3 network protocol, with TCP, a layer 4 transport
            protocol. IP is strictly an end-to-end addressing mechanism.
            IP packet headers have a source address, an destination
            address, and a few bytes of options. These get slapped on a
            packet which is then sent on it's merry way and forgotten
            about. Network layer protocols do not perform handshaking or
            retransmission. These functions get performed at a higher
            layer. As a result, IP is insensitive to transmission delay.
            It will work equally well across the room or out to Pluto. It
            will even work over uindirectional links. UDP, a layer 4
            transport protocol, will also work over unidirectional links,
            allowing applications to be built that are not sensitive to
            delay. TCP, on the other hand, requires a bidirectional link
            to perform handshaking. The round-trip-time and the TCP
            "window" buffer size combine to restrict the maximum
            throughput possible over a TCP connection. TCP experiments
            have been done with the ACTS satellite in geosynchronous orbit
            that achieved a throughput of 540 Mbits/sec. It appears that
            TCP is quite useable in a planetary neighborhood, out to about
            lunar distance. Beyond that, UDP-based applications are called
            for.
         4. Isn't IP designed for clean terrestrial links instead of
            noisy, intermittant space links?
            This is another misconception. One of the commonest physical
            links for the terrestrial Internet, the telephone line, has a
            bit error rate (BER) than is similar to most spacecraft RF
            links! The CCITT recommendations for voice circuits that have
            been conditioned to carry data is a BER of 10^-5 (Source: ITT
            Reference Data for Radio Engineers). On the other hand, NASA
            typically specs it's spacecraft RF links at a BER of 10^-5!
            The reason IP works over the phone lines is that the modem
            applies error correction down at the physical layer,
            transparently to the upper layers. This allows the upper
            layers to behave as though they have a clean link. Similarly,
            NASA applies error correction to it's space links, achieving
            BERs down to 10^-7 or better. At 10^-7, handshaking protocols,
            such as TCP/IP, work well.
         5. What is required to adapt a ground station for IP to a
            spacecraft?
            Connect the clock and data lines from the groundstation RF
            system to a synchronous serial WAN port on a router.
         6. Isn't the Space Communication Protocol Standards (SCPS) suite
            of protocols designed to overcome the shortcomings of IP used
            in space networks?
            At the time the SCPS Rationale, Requirements, and Application
            Notes document (CCSDS SCPS-710-0-G-0.4) was generated, that
            was true; however, in the two years since then, while ongoing
            industry research has solved, implemented, standardized, and
            deployed IP solutions to many of these problems, and are
            continuing to do so. For example, IP now supports constrained
            bandwidth channels via the header compression standard defined
            in RFC-2507, which was SPECIFICALLY designed for channels with
            non-trival packet loss rates. And asymetric channels are
            better supported by Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) RFC-2018,
            which is now deployed standard with most operating systems.
            Selectable routing, such as flood routing, and managed
            connection operation is being handled under the evolving IETF
            draft for the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol, and
            congestion signaling is being handled by Explicit Congestion
            Notification (ECN) and Random Early Detection (RED) spelled
            out in RFC-2481.
