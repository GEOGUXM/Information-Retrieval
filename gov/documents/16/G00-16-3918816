      This page contains a small collection of links that may be useful for
      C++ programmers and software designers. If you know of a link that you
      find useful in your daily work, please bring it to my attention, by
      sending me mail.

   C++ Links

        * Bjarne Stroustrup's home page. Dr. Stroustrup is the designer and
          original implementor of the C++ programming language.
        * KAI C++ online documentation. KAI (Kuck & Associates, Inc.) is the
          current compiler vendor-of-choice for CDF and DÃ˜.
        * Dinkum C++ Library Reference. Dinkumware provides the
          implementation of the C++ Standard Library for several compiler
          vendors. Specifically, they provide the version of the Standard
          Library shipped with Microsoft Visual C++ V5.0 and V6.0. This site
          provides an excellent description of each of the Standard Library
          headers, and the classes and functions defined in them.
        * Standard Template Library Programmer's Guide. This site, hosted by
          SGI, provides documentation not only of the STL, but also a good
          introduction to generic programming. SGI is the current employer of
          Alexander Stepanov, originator of the STL.
        * C/C++ Users Journal "Experts" forum. This is an online extension of
          C/C++ Users Journal, which includes articles from several of the
          contributors to the now-defunct C++ Report.

   Design Links

        * Extreme Programming. This site explains the design and coding style
          of Extreme Programming (XP), a lightweight team process for the
          development of good software in a humane environment. Of special
          interest is the "final draft" version of the upcoming book eXtreme
          Programming Installed, available (via ftp) from this site.
