   A Range Safety Officer (RSO) is the person who makes firing on the
   club's
   range a safe activity by enforcing the range rules. Our Range Safety
   Officers, regardless of experience or authority in the club, attend a
   two hour Range Safety Officer training session prior to becoming a
   Range Safety Officer. They also must take and pass a test with a score
   of 90 or better and have experience shooting on NRA approved ranges
   operated by a Range Safety Officer.
