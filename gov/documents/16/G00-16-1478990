   We are one of three central management agencies in the federal
   government. We are headquartered in Washington, DC, and have 11
   regional offices in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago,
   Kansas City, Fort Worth, Denver, San Francisco, Auburn (Washington),
   and Washington, DC.

   We support federal employees wherever they work -- in an office
   building, a warehouse, a national forest, or a government car. We
   provide workspace, security, furniture, equipment, supplies, tools,
   computers, and telephones. We also provide travel and transportation
   services, manage the federal motor vehicle fleet, oversee telecommuting
   centers and federal child care centers, preserve historic buildings,
   manage a fine arts program, and develop, advocate, and evaluate
   governmentwide policy.
   Since 1949, we have housed federal workers and provided products and
   services to support the important work of government throughout the
   country. We affect almost $66 billion in financial transactions
   throughout the government. We employ about 14,000 people and have an
   annual budget of approximately $16 billion.
   Please note that FSS has recently migrated information from the FSS
   Homepage to the GSA Portal. We recommend that visitors who bookmarked
   the FSS page update their bookmarks to www.gsa.gov.
   To ease the transition for customers familiar with the former FSS
   Homepage structure, the offering links on either side of this page will
   take you directly to the correct GSA portal site. Thank you for your
   patience and support.
   If you have questions concerning this change or recommendations for
   improvements, please contact us via email at webmaster.fss@gsa.gov
