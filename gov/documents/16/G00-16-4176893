   Enforcement
   Purpose
   In adopting the Political Reform Act in 1974 (the "Act"), the voters
   declared "...Previous laws regulating political practices have suffered
   from inadequate enforcement by State and local authorities" (Section
   81001(h)). The voters specified that, with regard to the Political
   Reform Act, "... Adequate enforcement mechanisms should be provided to
   public officials and private citizens in order that this title will be
   vigorously enforced" (Section 81002(f)). Therefore, in accordance with
   the direction of the voters, the mission of the Enforcement Division is
   to provide for the timely and impartial investigation and prosecution
   of alleged violations of the Act.
   Staffing
   The Enforcement Division is currently staffed with 25 people. The
   positions utilized include division chief, staff counsel, investigator,
   accounting specialist, political reform consultant, associate
   governmental program analyst and clerical. The Enforcement Division is
   assigned to investigate alleged violations of the Political Reform Act,
   and where appropriate, initiate formal administrative or civil
   enforcement proceedings. The Enforcement Division conducts
   investigations relating to both state and local matters.
