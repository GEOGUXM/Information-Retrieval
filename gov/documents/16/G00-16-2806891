     Social Security benefits can provide much needed support for you and
     your family when you retire, if you become disabled, and when you
     die. This web page is designed to help you better understand your
     Social Security protection as you plan for your financial future.

                       Retirement - How to qualify for retirement benefits




   We all want to plan for a comfortable retirement. This section of the
   Planner will help you learn how you qualify for Social Security
   retirement benefits, which members of your family may get benefits with
   you, and how and when you should apply. You can also link to outside
   web sites that discuss other sources of retirement income and
   post-retirement concerns such as housing, medical care, and leisure
   activities.

                  Disability - How you may qualify for disability benefits

     What if you are disabled before you reach retirement age? This
   section explains how you and your family may qualify for benefits if
   you become severely disabled before you qualify for retirement
   benefits. Even very young workers may already have earned disability
   protection.

                                Survivors - Learn about survivors benefits


     What help is available for survivors? This section helps you learn
   about survivors benefits from two sides: first, how your family members
   are protected when you die and second, how you yourself may qualify as
   a survivor on someone else's Social Security record. This protection is
   particularly important for young families with children.

                         Calculators - Calculate you own benefit estimates


     Calculate your own benefits. Each year, we will send you your
   personal Social Security Statement, which gives you an estimate of the
   monthly benefit amounts you and your family may qualify for now and in
   the future. However, you may want to use different assumptions about
   your future earnings or when you will stop working. The calculators in
   this section allow you to explore different options and see how they
   may affect your benefit amounts.
