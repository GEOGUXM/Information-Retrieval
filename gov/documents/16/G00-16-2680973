   On October 23, 1999, members of Pike County Girl Scout Troop 411,
   joined in the Augusta Lake acid mine drainage remediation project.
   Similar to work done by the boy scouts, troop members constructed one
   critical sandbag dike, for a wetland area, and spread soda-ash
   briquettes to neutralize the acid soils and acid laden water that will
   impound behind the dike.

   Boy Scout Troop 151  - One of the many projects underway by Indiana's
   Patoka South Fork Watershed Steering Committee is reclamation of the 52
   acre acid filled Augusta Lake. In an effort to neutralize the lake,
   along with over two miles of Mill Creek, before it drains into the
   Patoka River, Boy Scouts from Troop 151, under the leadership of Chuck
   Froehle, scout leader, did reclamation work on August 28, 1999.

   Scout Troop 182, from Jasper Indiana, led by Bart Pitstick, volunteered
   their services on August 26, 2000, to help with the Augusta Lake
   Remediation Project.  They filled over 200 sandbags to re-enforce one
   of three dikes created last year.

   Partner - The Augusta Lake AMD remediation project is well underway by
   Indiana's Patoka South Fork Watershed Steering Committee with the
   inclusion of corporate partner Airgas, Inc.  Direct neutralization of
   the 52 acre acid lake with liquid calcium hydroxide from Airgas'
   Mid-America plant in Evansville Indiana began September 1, 1999.
   Airgas is donating the calcium hydroxide to the Patoka South Fork
   Watershed Steering Committee.

   third phase of this project entails direct neutralization of AMD at the
   source, within the acid bearing spoil banks. To accomplish this,
   calcium hydroxide is being applied to neutralize acid groundwater
   flowing into the lake. Within the drainage basin of the lake, strategic
   locations have been excavated, and calcium hydroxide, donated by
   Airgas, Inc.  is applied.
