                             The Chromospheric Network

      The chromospheric network is a web-like pattern most easily seen in the
      emissions of the red line of hydrogen (H-alpha) and the ultraviolet
      line of calcium (Ca II K - from calcium atoms with one electron
      removed). The network outlines the supergranule cells and is due to the
      presence of bundles of magnetic field lines that are concentrated there
      by the fluid motions in the supergranules.

                                Filaments and Plage

      Filaments are dark, thread-like features seen in the red light of
      hydrogen (H-alpha). These are dense, somewhat cooler, clouds of
      material that are suspended above the solar surface by loops of
      magnetic field. Plage, the French word for beach, are bright patches
      surrounding sunspots that are best seen in H-alpha. Plage are also
      associated with concentrations of magnetic fields and form a part of
      the network of bright emissions that characterize the chromosphere.

                                    Prominences

      Prominences are dense clouds of material suspended above the surface of
      the Sun by loops of magnetic field. Prominences and filaments are
      actually the same things except that prominences are seen projecting
      out above the limb, or edge, of the Sun. Both filaments and prominences
      can remain in a quiet or quiescent state for days or weeks. However, as
      the magnetic loops that support them slowly change, filaments and
      prominences can erupt and rise off of the Sun over the course of a few
      minutes or hours.

                                     Spicules

      Spicules are small, jet-like eruptions seen throughout the
      chromospheric network. They appear as short dark streaks in the H-alpha
      image to the left (National Solar Observatory/Sacramento Peak). They
      last but a few minutes but in the process eject material off of the
      surface and outward into the hot corona at speeds of 20 to 30 km/s.
