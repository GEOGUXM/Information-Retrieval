   Wanted: Small Businesses Looking for Big Profits
   January 26, 2001

   If you have ever dreamed of starting your own business or expanding
   your existing small business, here's your chance.

   On March 1 and 2, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.,
   will host the 13th Annual High-Tech Conference for Small Businesses at
   the Westin Los Angeles Airport Hotel. During the two-day conference,
   participants seeking contracting and subcontracting business can mingle
   with more than 250 federal, state and city government representatives
   and get one- on-one counseling on how to succeed.

   The conference focus is on subcontracting and marketing opportunities
   for small, minority, and women-owned businesses in the high-tech
   industry and includes several "how-to" workshops featuring up-to-date
   information on major programs, small business initiatives and other
   topics of interest.

   Two networking receptions will provide opportunities to meet key
   people. Registration is $100 per person and is due no later than
   February 14, 2001. Pre-registration is advised as this event is
   well-attended. For hotel accommodations, contact the Westin directly at
   (310) 216-5858. For further conference details, please visit the
   conference Web site at
   http://acquisition.jpl.nasa.gov/boo/hightech2001.htm or contact the
   conference registration desk at (818) 354-7532.

   Last year, NASA awarded more than $2 billion in contracts to minority-
   and women-owned firms across the United States. The figure represents
   18.3 percent of NASA's total contract dollars -- NASA's largest
   commitment ever with such firms. It compares with just 7.2 percent or
   $865 million in FY 92.

   Recently, NASA was named one of America's top 50 organizations for
   providing multicultural business opportunities. NASA received the honor
   after the first Internet-based poll involving more than 50,000 of
   America's leading women- and minority-owned businesses. Div2000.com, a
   business portal providing the link among multicultural businesses,
   Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies and universities, conducted
   the poll. The "top 50" list also included such companies as IBM,
   Boeing, Microsoft, 3Com, Wal-Mart and Cisco Systems.

   JPL is managed for NASA by the California Institute of Technology in
   Pasadena.
