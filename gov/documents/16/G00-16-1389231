     SOFIA
     NASA and the German space agency, DLR , are working together to create
     SOFIA - a Boeing 747-SP aircraft modified to accommodate a 2.5 meter
     reflecting telescope. SOFIA will be the largest airborne telescope in
     the world, and will make observations that are impossible for even the
     largest and highest of ground-based telescopes. The observatory is
     being developed and operated for NASA by a team of industry experts led
     by the Universities Space Research Association (USRA). SOFIA will be
     based at NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Federal Airfield near
     Mountain View, California, and is expected to begin flying in the year
     2001.

     SPACE STATION BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
     The Space Station Biological Research Project is responsible for the
     facilities that will be used to conduct life sciences research on board
     the International Space Station. For the first time therewill be a
     complete gravitational biology laboratory in space. Features include
     multiple habitats to support a variety of organisms, a centrifuge with
     a selectable rotation rate to house specimens at a variety of gravity
     levels, a holding rack to house specimens at microgravity, and a fully
     equipped workstation/glovebox. Also provided will be microscopes,
     freezers, and other laboratory research equipment to conduct
     experimental procedures.
