   The International Space Station is an unparalleled, international
   collaborative venture that enables long-term space exploration and
   provides economic benefit to people on Earth. In view of the global
   nature of the ISS, the International Partners recognize the value of
   coordinated approaches to commercial development. This Web site, and
   its content, demonstrates the cooperation between the partners.

   Each International Partner retains the autonomy to operate their own
   commercial program aboard the ISS, within the framework of
   international agreements. General policies and procedures common to all
   the International Partners, such as data rights, are shown on this
   site. Each International PartnerÂ’s ISS commercial policies and
   practices, prices, and points of contact are also shown.
