   will take you to each of the major areas existing in the BDMS web
   environment. Who are we ? We are the Mechanical Support design and
   drafting group for the Beams Division at Fermilab, our responsibilities
   are for the mechanical components and utility systems that support the
   Accelerators at the laboratory.

   Some of the major areas consist of Ultra High Vacuum Systems, LCW Water
   Systems, R.F. Systems, Electrical Distribution Systems, and the
   Mechanical components that comprise these utilities, along with
   Structural Supports for all the devices.

   We work with SDRC's Master Series software as well as ANSYS Finite
   Element. We have many resources associated with these software packages
   that may be found at this site.
