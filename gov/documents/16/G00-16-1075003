AoA to Hold Western Older Americans Act Listening Session
   _____________________________________________________________________

   HHS Assistant Secretary for Aging Josefina G. Carbonell will convene a
   National Listening Session on the Older Americans Act (OAA) in Phoenix,
   Arizona on January 23. This is one of several forums that have been
   conducted across the country.  The session will provide older people,
   family caregivers, and aging service providers with the opportunity to
   share their suggestions about ways to improve programs and services
   provided through the OAA, in advance of the development of regulations.

   Older Americans Act services include: home-delivered meals and
   congregate nutrition services; transportation to help keep older adults
   independent; and protection from abuse, neglect and exploitation. The
   most recent amendments to the Act added the National Family Caregiver
   Support Program.

   While in Arizona, the Assistant Secretary will take part in opening
   ceremonies of Mosaic, the new Maricopa County Elder Refugee Center, and
   will meet with older refugees from Bosnia, Russia, Cuba and Vietnam to
   discuss the educational, cultural and social services available through
   the new center.  She will later visit the Guadalupe Senior Center that
   provides specialized programs and services for Mexican-American Yaqui
   Indian elders.
