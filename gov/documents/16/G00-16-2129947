   World Ocean Circulation Experiment logo World Ocean Circulation
   Experiment (WOCE) Global Data Version 2.0 - WOCE, a part of the World
   Climate Research Programme (WCRP), has used resources from nearly 30
   countries to make unprecedented in-situ and satellite observations of
   the global ocean between 1990 and 1998. This was done to observe poorly
   understood, but important physical processes in an attempt to study the
   large scale circulation of the oceans. The resulting diverse WOCE data
   sets found on Version 2.0 of the CD-ROMs are an update of data and
   information from Version 1.0. These CDs will serve as a unique resource
   for climate researchers and marine scientists for decades to come. All
   CDs are designed to be accessed by an Internet browser. (September
