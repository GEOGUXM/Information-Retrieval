   Welcome to Southwestern’s Estimated Generation Schedules Page. These
   schedules provide the public with the suggested hydropower releases in
   the Southwestern region. Please be aware that they are subject to
   change to meet power demand. In addition, they only reflect releases
   through the hydropower facilities and do not include normal U.S. Army
   Corps of Engineers releases.

   Government. Neither the United States Government nor any agency
   thereof, nor any of their employees, makes any warranty, express or
