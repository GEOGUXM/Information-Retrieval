Facts about Anthrax


   Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the spore-forming
   bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax most commonly occurs in hoofed
   mammals and can also infect humans.


   Symptoms of disease vary depending on how the disease was contracted,
   but usually occur within 7 days after exposure. The serious forms of
   human anthrax are inhalation anthrax, cutaneous anthrax, and intestinal
   anthrax.


   Initial symptoms of inhalation anthrax infection may resemble a common
   cold. After several days, the symptoms may progress to severe breathing
   problems and shock. Inhalation anthrax is often fatal.


   The intestinal disease form of anthrax may follow the consumption of
   contaminated food and is characterized by an acute inflammation of the
   intestinal tract. Initial signs of nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting,
   and fever are followed by abdominal pain, vomiting of blood, and severe
   diarrhea.


   Direct person-to-person spread of anthrax is extremely unlikely, if it
   occurs at all. Therefore, there is no need to immunize or treat
   contacts of persons ill with anthrax, such as household contacts,
   friends, or coworkers, unless they also were also exposed to the same
   source of infection.


   In persons exposed to anthrax, infection can be prevented with
   antibiotic treatment.


   Early antibiotic treatment of anthrax is essentialâ€“delay lessens
   chances for survival. Anthrax usually is susceptible to penicillin,
   doxycycline, and fluoroquinolones.


   An anthrax vaccine also can prevent infection. Vaccination against
   anthrax is not recommended for the general public to prevent disease
   and is not available.
