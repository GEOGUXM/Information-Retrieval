"In an effort to increase our communications, let's talk story"

   Kenneth M Kaneshiro,
   State Conservationist, Hawaii

   Talk Story with Ken is a way to send direct comments and feedback
   anonymously to the Hawaii State Conservationist of the Natural
   Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) on the agency's products,
   services, and delivery mechanisms. It is a tool to receive unfiltered
   comments from our conservation partners, our customers, and our
   employees.

   Because our feedback is not secure and is open to all, we request that
   you include only information you want available to the public. Please
   do not include specific or confidential information related to your
   agricultural or related practice's/business or other issues.

   How the Feedback System Works
   There are two ways to send your comments:
     * Using the World Wide Web -- enter your message into the comment
       field on the web page response form.
     * Using other electronic mail -- address your message to:
       talkstc@hi.usda.gov

   The identity and location of the sender will be automatically stripped
   from each web or e-mail message before it is read by anyone. No
   identifying information will be retained.

   How Feedback Will Be Used
   Information provided through this system will be used to evaluate and
   improve NRCS programs, products, services, and delivery mechanisms.
