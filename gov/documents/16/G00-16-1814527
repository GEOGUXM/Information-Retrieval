   PURCHASE CARD ADMINISTRATION

   Acquisition Services administers the purchase card program for the
   Office of the Secretary of Transportation, the Office of Inspector
   General, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, as well as for the
   Transportation Administrative Service Center. We offer a complete range
   of services to our customers including the establishment and
   maintenance of accounts with the participating bank, cardholder
   training, oversight, and account termination. Oversight is performed
   through the use of electronic audit capabilities that give purchase
   card administrators desktop audit capability. With close to $6 million
   in VISA purchases in FY96, Acquisition Services had the third largest
   purchase card program within DOT, and had the highest average dollar
   purchase within DOT.
