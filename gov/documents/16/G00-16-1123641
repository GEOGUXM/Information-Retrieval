   Information Exploitation

   Overloaded with information?

   In today's information revolution, people have to deal with large
   quantities of data in many different formats and from many different
   sources. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is developing innovative
   technologies to exploit massive multi-media information resources.

   These technologies can help you work more effectively by helping you
   locate the information you need, explore relationships within data and
   integrate different kinds of data in a way that's meaningful to you.
   Some examples include
   ThemeView is one of many powerful visualizations in Information
   Exploitation.
     * information visualization- creating graphic representations that
       users can explore to identify themes, trends and relationships
     * information synthesis and fusion-integrating different kinds of raw
       information, including video, audio, geospatial and sensor readings
       for better understanding and analysis
     * data mining-developing methods to store, locate and integrate
       information in different databases and from various sources
