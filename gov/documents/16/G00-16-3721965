   First measurements with the ASM-IIa 3/20/01 S. Junnarkar, P. O'Connor *
   Setup The ASM-IIa board (
   http://atlas-csc.inst.bnl.gov/list/pdf00000.pdf ) is the first
   prototype of the sampling and digitizing section of the on-chamber CSC
   electronics. We have implemented a simple controller that repetitively
   writes and reads all 144 cells of the HAMAC SCA. The sampling clock is
   40 MHz and the read clock is 5 MHz at this time. 12 channels (one SCA
   chip) are written in parallel during the write phase which lasts (144 *
   25 ns) = 3.6 microsec. The read phase takes (144 * 15 * 200 ns) = 432
   microsec, since for each sample, it takes 15 read clocks to read out
   the 12 channels. As the samples are read out they are digitized and the
   digitized samples from the first 4 channels are re-ordered and sent to
   FIFO's. After the readout cycle is complete the FIFO's are read out
   into DACs that reconstruct the analog waveforms at the inputs. * DC
   characteristics We have measured the transfer characteristic of the
   system using DC levels at the input. Figure on p.2 shows the transfer
   characteristic from the input to the SCA output. Note the SCA output is
   differential, the signal channel and a reference pipeline are
   subtracted. We scale the difference by 0.2 and apply an offset to scale
   the analog signal into the input range of the AD9042 ADC, which is 2.4
   V + or  0.5V. Note that the offset and scale factors are not optimized
   yet. Figure on p.3 is the residuals from this fit. Pg. 4 is the
   transfer characteristic to the DAC output, and Pg. 5 is the residuals
   of this fit. * Waveform capture and readout Pg. 6 shows the waveforms
   with a time-varying input. A single-cycle sinewave, of duration 3
   microsec, is synchronized with the write clock and applied to the
   input. Pg. 7 shows the same waveforms when the input pulse has a
   duration similar to the one from the preamp/shaper. 1 SCA Output = ADC
