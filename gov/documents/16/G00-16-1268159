                           Quantum Chaos in Helium
     __________________________________________________________________

   Two's a party, three's a crowdespecially in a tiny space. Two objects
   that exert electrostatic or gravitational forces on each other have
   relatively simple dynamics: the forces scale as the square of the
   distance between the objects. A three-body system, however, cannot be
   solved analytically (it is nonintegrable), which indicates that the
   dynamics involve a mixture of regularity and chaos. Add to that the
   constraints of quantum mechanics, and things get truly challenging.
   Now, an investigation into the transition from quantum dynamics to
   chaos in the spectrum of helium has shed a little bit of light on one
   of physicss blackest boxesquantum chaos.

   Since the work of Poincaré a century ago, the problem of three bodies
   interacting under their mutual gravitational forces (such as the earth,
   moon, and sun) has been known to exhibit a mixture of classical and
   chaotic dynamics. A system of three charged particles should have
   similar dynamics (within a sign), even in very small systems. But as
   yet, scientists don't know how to reconcile chaos with a quantum
   mechanical view of the universe. Classical dynamics allows for the
   chaotic motion of three bodies, because the mechanics can be described
   with nonlinear equations of motion; quantum mechanics, however, does
   not have this way to account for chaos, because the Schrödinger
   equation is linear. Furthermore, the quantum states of the helium atom,
   the prototypical three-body charged-particle system, occur in seemingly
   regular progressions, labeled by sets of quantum numbers. How, then,
   can classical mechanics and quantum mechanics be reconciled? What are
   the manifestations of the underlying classical chaos in the quantum
   spectrum of helium?

                             Understanding Chaos

   Those of us who are not physicists tend to think of chaos as a state of
   randomness, a complex situation where chance alone ultimately
   determines what is going on. For physicists, chaos is more ordered than
   random, and it shows up in seemingly simple systems. It is defined as
   an extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, to the point where small
   changes in these conditions lead to larger and larger differences in
   outcomes over time, ultimately yielding wildly divergent results. The
   result is a dynamic system whose future behavior we cannot predict by
   observation of its past behavior, even though its dynamics follow a set
   of determined rules. Systems like this are incredibly common. In fact,
   Henri Poincaré pointed out back in the 19th century that most dynamic
   systems are chaotic. Chaotic behavior has been noted in weather
   patterns, chemical reactions, and the evolution of insect populations.
   Studies of chaos help us to understand the behavior of earthquakes,
   lasers, fluids, mechanical structures, neural networks, and even
   biological rhythms. Thus, understanding chaos, both in the realm of the
   familiar classical mechanics and in the realm of quantum mechanics, is
   key to understanding the dynamics of our world.


   To answer these questions, an international group working at Beamline
   9.0.1 (now Beamline 10.0.1) has used the bright beams of the ALS along
   with theoretical modeling to search for quantum chaos in the
   photoabsorption spectrum of heliumand theyve found it. The high
   brightness on this undulator beamline allowed the resolution (about 2
   meV) necessary to distinguish tightly spaced states near heliums
   double-ionization threshold. Electrons in these high-energy, doubly
   excited states are known to show more classical behavior than those
   lying closer to the nucleus. But the states are so close together that
   a third-generation light source is needed to resolve them. The
   resulting spectrum was compared to a new theoretical model based on a
   random matrix approach to chaotic systems. Agreement between the model
   and the data was excellent, allowing the experimenters to extend the
   statistical analysis even to states above those seen in the
   experimental spectrum.

   The electronic states of doubly excited helium can be labeled as
   N,K[n], where N is the principal quantum number of the inner electron,
   n is that of the outer electron, and K is the angular correlation
   between the two. States with the same N converge to an ionization
   threshold, I[N]. The researchers found that, as the electron energies
   approach the ionization threshold for electrons with higher N, the
   statistical properties of the spacing between neighboring energy levels
   clearly display a transition toward quantum chaos. Where I[N] >4, the
   N1 series begins to be perturbed by higher series. Where I[N] >8, the
   effect is strong enough that traditional quantum numbers can no longer
   describe the dynamics. Statistical analyses also showed that, as I[N]
   increases, plots of the spacings between nearest-neighbor states move
   from being best described by a Poisson distribution (associated with
   regular systems) to more closely approximating a Wigner distribution
   (associated with chaotic systems). This observation of the onset of
   chaotic dynamics in a simple three-body system shows, for the first
   time, how the underlying classical chaos manifests in a simple and
   well-studied quantum system.

   states of helium, analyzed individually for each series associated
       with a given value of NK: blue, distribution derived from
   experiment; red, best fit from three-dimensional model calculations
   for states below I[9]; purple, best fit from one-dimensional model
     calculations for states below I[17]; dashed green line, Wigner
    distribution. The marked tendency toward a Wigner distribution as
     higher lying states are included indicates the onset of chaos.
