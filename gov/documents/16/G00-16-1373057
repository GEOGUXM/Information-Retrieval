                             Payment Information


   TEAS has changed its payment options and procedures. Three options
   (credit card, automated deposit account (New!), and Electronic Funds
   Transfer (New!)) will now appear after clicking on the PAY/SUBMIT
   button, which is available on the bottom of the Validation Page after
   completing and validating the application form. You will NOT specify a
   payment option in the Form Wizard or within the form itself.

  Credit Card Information:

       credit card
       The USPTO accepts VISA®, MasterCard®, Discover®, and American
       Express®.
       The USPTO is sensitive to your concerns regarding the security of
       using your credit cards to perform transactions over the Internet.
       Therefore, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which encrypts your
       credit card data while it is being transferred. This makes it very
       difficult for someone to steal your credit card information.
       Encryption means that all of your information, including your
       credit card number, is scrambled and locked with a mathematical key
       during transfer. Most browsers have an icon such as a key key or a
       lock lock to represent an encrypted mode or session. A broken key
       keyopen , open lock lockopen , or no lock indicates that the
       session or mode is not encrypted.
       SSL works with Netscape Navigator® (versions 2.0 and above),
       Microsoft Internet Explorer® (versions 3.0 and above), and AOL®
       (versions 3.0 and above), so that unauthorized parties cannot read
       the information that you send.
       NOTE: Regularly Scheduled Outage: The USPTO will NOT process
       payments from 12:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Sundays only.
       Therefore, e-TEAS applications cannot be transmitted during these
       hours.

  Deposit Account Information:

       The USPTO will offer an automated deposit account transaction. A
       deposit account is a pre-established account that is maintained
       with the USPTO, from which fees are to be charged. Unlike the
       previously-existing deposit account transaction, where processing
       occurred manually after filing the application, the automated
       deposit account transaction will be performed in "real time;" i.e.,
       the USPTO now verifies once you complete the application that
       sufficient funds exist in the deposit account to cover the
       application fee(s). If sufficient funds are not available, a serial
       number will not be assigned. NOTE: Deposit account users must now
       also enter, along with the six-digit deposit account number, a
       four-digit access code. An access code was assigned to each USPTO
       deposit account in conjunction with the establishment of the
       Automated Voice Response System for deposit account information
       back in 1997. This access code was sent out to the Point of Contact
       at your company/firm at that time. The access code is required to
       authorize USPTO to process this payment request. If you do not know
       the access code for your deposit account and you are an authorized
       user of the account, you may contact the Office of Finance Deposit
       Account Branch at 703-305-4631 or by e-mail daadmin@uspto.gov to
       obtain the access code for your account. Please note that the
       Office of Finance Deposit Account Branch cannot give out the access
       code to anyone not on the authorized user list for the deposit
       account.
       NOTE: Regularly Scheduled Outage: The USPTO will NOT process
       payments from 12:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Sundays only.
       Therefore, e-TEAS applications cannot be transmitted during these
       hours.

  Electronic Funds Transfer:

       The Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) payment method allows you to
       send the PTO a payment over the Internet as easily as writing a
       check. In general, the Automated Clearing House performs EFT
       transactions through the Federal Reserve system. To read more about
       the Automated Clearing House, click here. To read more about the
       Federal Reserve system and their involvement with the Automated
       Clearing House, click here. NOTE: The EFT payment method can only
       to be used by customers with U.S. affiliated bank accounts (those
       banks who are a member of the American Banking Association (ABA)
       network).
       To pay through EFT, all you will need is a check (not deposit
       slip). You must be authorized to sign checks on this account to use
       this payment method. To help identify the information that will be
       requested off of your check, please review this diagram:
       EFT
       In order to use the USPTO's EFT payment mechanism, you must
       establish a UserID and Password. To create a UserID and Password,
       click "Pay by EFT" on the screen that appears after clicking on the
       PAY/SUBMIT button at the bottom of the Validation Page (which comes
       up after you have completed the application and successfully
       validated the form). Then, click on "Create User Account." Once you
       have entered the "EFT User Profile" page, you will be asked for the
       following information, most of which appears on the check:

    1. UserID - a unique ID that you will choose, 4-8 characters long. If

    3. Street Address 1 - Street Address of residence, business, or firm -

       bottom of the check (see example above).
   11. Account Number - the number located at the bottom of the check (see
       example above).
   12. Contact Phone Number - A valid U.S. contact phone number.
   13. Contact Email Address - A valid contact email address.
   14. Account Type - For most EFT users, the account type will be
       "Checking". However, some institutions will allow you to perform
       EFT transactions with Savings Accounts.
   15. Password - a combination of letters and/or digits, 6-8 characters
       long.

   After entering this information, you will have a UserID and Password
   that you may use to perform EFT transactions within TEAS, or any other
   USPTO website offering this payment option.
   NOTE: Regularly Scheduled Outage: The USPTO will NOT process payments
