   OPA News Release :

Statement of Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao Regarding The Unemployment
Numbers Released Today

   WASHINGTON  U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao released the
   following statement about the December unemployment situation today:

   Last month the unemployment rate rose to 5.8 percent, however, there
   are some helpful signs that we could be bottoming out. I hope that this
   New Year will bid farewell to old man recession and say hello to baby
   recovery. But we must be prepared to help unemployed and dislocated
   workers until the recovery hits home.

   The manufacturing sector, which has had difficulties since July, 2000,
   has lost 1.5 million jobs in that period. Since Sept. 11, the services
   sector has been suffering as well, particularly the travel and tourism
   industry. We are now seeing some signs of improvement in services,
   which increased by 72,000 jobs in December. Industries with job
   increases include education, amusement and recreation, health care,
   security services, and government.

   After two months of averaging 400,000 lost jobs, Decembers decline
   was smaller  124,000  although still far too many.

   In order to get through this recession it is critical that we support
   the presidents economic security plan to get us on the path to
   recovery. Unfortunately, partisan politics in the Senate has not been
   helping the situation

   While the House of Representatives has responsibly passed important
   measures to promote our economic security  benefits for trade affected
   workers, trade promotion authority, new energy jobs, and the
   Presidents economic security package  the Senate went home for
   Christmas without taking up any of these crucial items.

   With these new numbers, its more urgent than ever for Congress to
   pass the presidents economic security package to get the economy
   moving again and put more Americans back to work.
