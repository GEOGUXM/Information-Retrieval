                                  stepperb
  A 3-D rendering of a stepper motor and housing with cut-aways from x-ray
                          computed tomography data.

                                  10kbothb
     An ultrasonic image of a 10 kopek coin. Notice the detail available
                       from both surfaces of the coin.

 I am involved with the development of nondestructive inspection techniques,
   particularly computed tomography, ultrasonic, eddy current and infrared
   inspection. I do both inspections and development in these areas. This
 includes development of analysis and image processing techniques to aid in
the interpretation of our data. My primary responsibility is for the computed
tomography (CT) systems and the image processing and 3-D rendering associated
    with it. I am also in the process of bringing both a high energy and
  microfocus x-ray CT systems on line to enhance our inspection capability.

     I have also helped develop and implement our integrated inspection
     station, a system that can perform both ultrasonic and eddy current
   inspections of parts with a single apparatus. We are in the process of
    upgrading the station to include other inspection techniques as well.
    In particular acoustic resonance spectroscopy and infrared inspection
                       devices are under development.

   I assist with the planning and management of our network which consists
    of a hetrogeneous collection of Unix, Windows for Workgroups, Windows
       NT, and Macintosh machines. My responsibilities include system
   management and maintenance of hardware and software for those machines.

     My professional interests also include digital design and computer
   architecture. I like research and enjoy problem solving. Please look at
           my resume for a better idea of my skills and abilities.

                                     ecb
     An eddy current image of a multi-layer test and calibration piece.

                                     irb
                An infrared image of a laser welding process.
