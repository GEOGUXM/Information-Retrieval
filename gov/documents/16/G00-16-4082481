   Preservation Incentives
   Office of Historic Preservation




   A wide variety of incentives are available to give property owners
   motivation to repair and rehabilitate historical resources rather than
   turn to demolition and new construction. Although many such incentives
   are offered by local governments and therefore vary between
   jurisdictions in California, other incentives are offered by federal
   and state government. These include federal tax credits for
   rehabilitation of qualified historical resources, property tax
   abatement programs, alternative building codes, and tax deductions for
   preservation easements. Incentives are an extremely important component
   of any historic preservation program.
   Please be aware that these pages related to incentives do not contain
   information related to grants and other sources of funding of historic
   preservation projects, which are discussed at another location of this
   website.
