    Behrenfeld-Falkowsky semi-analytical ocean primary productivity model
   Howard-Yoder semi-analytical ocean primary productivity model

       These are the maps created using the MODIS weekly ocean primary
   productivity models. These are the annual average results for Oct. 1997
    to Sept. 1998 using input chlorophyll from SeaWiFS, Reynolds SST and
     DAO daily short-wave surface irradiance data and FNMOC mixed-layer
                                 depth data.

              Stay tuned for the results using real MODIS data.
