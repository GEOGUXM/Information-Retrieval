   The WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) Modeling System development
    project is a multi-year project being undertaken by several agencies.
   The coordination of this development effort is handled through several
      layers of joint management, incorporating all of the constituent
               groups, as well as outside advisory positions.

   The ten working groups (usually a representative from each of the major
       institutions) handle the actual development and testing of the
   software. Each of the groups is a member of one of the five development
   teams, with the group leaders generally coordinating their efforts with
   their team leader. The leaders of these working units may be contacted
                               through email:
     * Group Leaders: glead@wrf-model.org. Each of the groups maintains a
       web page to facilitate development of the project and communication
       among the geographically diverse groups.
     * Team Leaders: tlead@wrf-model.org. The teams coordinate efforts
       within their groups.

   The WRF Oversight Board (WOB) has representatives of each of the major
   institutions involved in the development: NOAA/NCEP, NOAA/FSL, NCAR and
   AFWA. This board also has NSF membership. This group is concerned with
   budgetary issues and the overall progress of the effort. The WOB may be
                       contacted at wob@wrf-model.org.

     At the highest level, the scientific issues of the WRF development
   overseen by the WRF Science Board (WSB). This group is involved in the
       technical evaluation of the entire WRF package. The WSB may be
                       contacted at wsb@wrf-model.org.

       The WRF Project Coordinator reports to the Oversight Board, and
    directly oversees the five Development Teams. The project coordinator
                     may be contacted at klemp@ucar.edu.
