                       Data Visualization and Analysis

   Ferret is an interactive computer visualization and analysis
   environment designed to meet the needs of oceanographers and
   meteorologists analyzing large and complex gridded data sets. It runs
   on most Unix systems, and on Windows NT/9x using X windows for display.
   It can be installed to run from a Web browser ("WebFerret") for use
   while away from your desk or from a system lacking X windows software.
   It can transparently access extensive remote Internet data bases using
   DODS; see http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/.

   Ferret was developed by the Thermal Modeling and Analysis Project
   (TMAP) at PMEL in Seattle to analyze the outputs of its numerical ocean
   models and compare them with gridded, observational data. The model
   data sets are generally multi- gigabyte in size with mixed 3 and
   4-dimensional variables defined on staggered grids. Ferret offers a
   Mathematica-like approach to analysis; new variables may be defined
   interactively as mathematical expressions involving data set variables.
   Calculations may be applied over arbitrarily shaped regions. Fully
   documented graphics are produced with a single command.

   Many excellent software packages have been developed recently for
   scientific visualization. The features that make Ferret distinctive
   among these packages are Mathematica-like flexibility, geophysical
   formatting, "intelligent" connection to its data base, memory
   management for very large calculations, and symmetrical processing in 4
   dimensions.

   Ferret is widely used in the oceanographic community to analyze data
   and create publication quality graphics. We have compiled an
   (incomplete) list of publications where the authors felt that the
   contribution of Ferret was sufficient to warrant an acknowledgment.
   We appreciate your acknowledgment of Ferret in your publications.  Here
   is a suggested acknowledgment that you may use.
