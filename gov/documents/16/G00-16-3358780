   The Community-Operated Environmental Surveillance Program (COESP) is an
   integral part of the Hanford Site Surface Environmental Surveillance
   Project. Community-Operated Environmental Surveillance at Hanford is a
   cooperative effort between the U.S. Department of Energy's Richland
   Field Office, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and citizens,
   communities, and schools around the Hanford Site. Local citizens,
   primarily teachers, participate in collecting air samples at selected
   locations off the site. This program was established to:
     * increase the public's awareness of, and stimulate interest in,
       Hanford environmental surveillance activities
     * increase public understanding of surveillance results
     * provide a means for the public to address Hanford-related
       environmental issues
     * provide an educational resource for local schools.

   Nine routine air sampling stations, positioned at selected locations
   around the perimeter of the Hanford Site have been included in the
   COESP. Four of the nine stations include large, lighted, covered
   informational displays that provide real-time meteorological and
   radiological information as well as general information on station
   equipment, sample types, and analyses. The managers of these stations
   are encouraged to use the stations in their school science programs.
   The managers also serve as public spokespeople for the
   Community-Operated Environmental Surveillance Program and function as a
   point of contact for local citizens.

   Air sampling data are discussed in the air sampling section (Section
   4.1 "Air Surveillance"), and external radiation data are discussed in
   the external radiation section (Section 4.6 "External Radiation
   Surveillance").
