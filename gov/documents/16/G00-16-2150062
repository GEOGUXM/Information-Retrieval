     If you noticed hundreds of red, white and blue balloons and the
     search and rescue dogs around the NOAA Science Center on November
     8th you saw just part of NOAA's Combined Federal Campaign Charity
     Fair and Rally happenings. Einstein, a 2 year old German Shepherd
     search and rescue dog with the Virginia Search and Rescue Dog
     Association, was one of 20 participating agencies represented from
     the over 3,000 CFC charities employees can choose from in this years
     campaign catalog.
     Mary Ann Whitcomb, the NOAA 2001 CFC Champaign Chair, started the
     Rally Day in the Auditorium with a motivating speech about the
     campaign. Scott B. Gudes, Acting Administrator and Deputy Under
     Secretary for NOAA, followed sharing his thoughts about NOAA's
     mission, it's CFC contributions and the impact of those
     contributions on the DC Metro Area and the Silver Spring community.
     Gudes individually recognized all those working on the Rally Day and
     the 2001 campaign. He gave special recognition and a plaque to Janet
     Ward for her design and production of the 2001 CFC Campaign poster.
     The formal program concluded with words from the DC Youth Orchestra
     (DCYO) Board of Directors member Mr. Dario Preato and from Ms. Debra
     Cooper, Director, Silver Spring Community Vision. Both shared the
     importance of the CFC to their organizations and the good works that
     have been done over the years.
     In the Science Center, the DCYO provided live entertainment from the
     talented string quartet musicians. OAR hosted the Charity Fair with
     refreshments and snacks. Among the many participating groups were
     the lively folks from Educational and Entertainment Foundation, Inc
     that produce wonderful stage productions for underprivileged
