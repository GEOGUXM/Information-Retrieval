                                Introduction

       The Clinical Trials Cooperative Group Program was conceived in 1955
       when Dr. Sidney Farber, Mary Lasker, and others approached Congress
       with a proposal that it increase support for studies of
       chemotherapy for cancer. Congress responded by appropriating $5
       million to the National Cancer Institute to establish the
       Chemotherapy National Service Center. By 1958, seventeen Groups
       were organized which operated under research grants from NCI; their
       main thrust was the testing of new anticancer agents from the NCI
       drug development program. Over the intervening years the Program
       has evolved into one which places major emphasis on definitive
       studies of combined modality approaches to the treatment of cancer.
       The scope of this program includes:

     * Approximately 20,000 new patients are accrued onto Group treatment
       studies each year.
     * 12,000 new patients are evaluated annually on ancillary laboratory
       correlative studies, and many times the combined number are in
       follow-up.
     * Thousands of individual investigators participate in Cooperative
       Group protocols.

       The Cooperative Groups are heterogeneous in their research
       objectives and their structures. These Groups presently are four
       major types:

    1. Groups that are specifically disease oriented (e.g., gynecologic
       oncology)
    2. Groups that are designed to deal primarily with high technology,
       single modality studies (e.g., radiation therapy)
    3. Groups in which the investigators have a particular expertise
       (e.g., pediatricians)
    4. Multimodal National Groups

   The common thread, however, is the development and conduct of
   large-scale trials in a multi-institutional setting.

                  Purpose of the Cooperative Group Program

   The essential feature of the Clinical Trials Cooperative Group Program
   is the support of organizations which continually generate and conduct
   new clinical trials consistent with national priorities for cancer
   treatment research. Emphasis is placed on definitive, randomized Phase
   III studies and the developmental efforts preliminary to them. While a
   wide variety of investigational efforts are therefore appropriate, this
   Program specifically does not overlap with or replace funding
   mechanisms for more narrowly focused, Research Project Grant activities
   (e.g., RO1, PO1 grants and U01, U19 cooperative agreements).

   One of the primary objectives underlying the formation of the Groups is
   the conduct of large multicenter trials for the investigational agents
   sponsored by CTEP. This allows the rapid accrual of patients while
   reducing the possible bias of studies carried out at a single or a few
   institutions.

                     Goals of Cooperative Group Research

   1. IMPROVE THERAPY

   Therapeutic research aimed at improving the survival and quality of
       life for persons with cancer is of highest priority to CTEP.

   2. ADJUNCT STUDIES
   The database of patient information accumulated in the course of
       treatment research, and the possibilities for large-scale
       collection of biologic samples with subsequent correlation of
       specific features with patient outcome, provide the Groups with
       unique opportunities to address scientific questions about
       molecular genetics, epidemiology, pathology and other
       cancer-related topics. Such ancillary investigations can add
       considerable strength to a Group's total scientific program, and
       are encouraged. While certain studies may be eligible for inclusion
       in a Group application for financial support, particularly when the
       laboratory efforts are integral to the clinical trials proposed, a
       variety of other funding mechanisms - including
       investigator-initiated grants (R01s, P01s) and cooperative
       agreements for discrete projects (U01s, U19s) - may also be
       appropriate.

   3. CLINICAL TRIALS METHODOLOGY
   The Groups provide a unique framework for research in clinical trials
       methodology. While CTEP encourages development of and
       experimentation with new study designs within the Group framework,
       purely statistical research is appropriately funded through other
       mechanisms.

                   CTEP and the Cooperative Group Program

       The NCI's Clinical Trials Cooperative Groups (the Cooperative
       Groups) consist of researchers at institutions affiliated with the
       Cooperative Groups, who jointly develop and conduct cancer
       treatment clinical trials in multi-institutional settings.
       Administered by CTEP staff, they are a major component of the
       extramural research effort of the DCTD, NCI. Each Cooperative Group
       is supported to continually generate new trials compatible with its
       particular areas of interest and expertise, as well as with
       national priorities for cancer treatment research. Unlike most
       other major NIH cooperative clinical trials efforts, the
       Cooperative Group structure and funding are not usually linked to
       any specific clinical trial(s).
       This mechanism thus has the potential for

          + considerable flexibility in resource allocation
          + the rapid testing of promising new cancer therapies in large
            patient populations

       This is feasible through the Cooperative Groups as they provide the
       apparatus for conducting such trials where the apparatus is
       constantly in place.
       The Cooperative Groups have been instrumental in the development of
       new standards of cancer patient management, and in the development
       of sophisticated clinical investigation techniques. See Clinical
       Trials Cooperative Group Accomplishments, 1986-1998

   CTEP funds over 150 U10 cooperative agreements encompassing the
   following Cooperative Groups:
    1. Cancer and Acute Leukemia Group B (CALGB)
    2. Childrens Cancer Study Group (CCSG)
    3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
    4. Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)
    5. National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP)
    6. North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG)
    7. Pediatric Oncology Group (POG)
    8. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)
    9. Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)
   10. Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG)
   11. National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTSG)
   12. American College of  Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG)

   The annual funding amount for the Cooperative Groups is approximately
   $90 million. Clinical trials for investigational anticancer agents are
   conducted under more than 175 INDs sponsored by DCTD, NCI and are
   carried out in part by the Clinical Trials Cooperative Groups. This
   includes investigational agents provided to DCTD, NCI by over 50
   Industry Collaborators.
