   Overview
   Background

   The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) outlines
   several provisions related to transportation planning. In particular,
   it defines seven factors that must be addressed within the planning
   process:
    1. Support the economic vitality of the metropolitan area, especially
       by enabling global competitiveness, productivity, and efficiency;
    2. Increase the safety and security of the transportation system for
       motorized and non-motorized users;
    3. Increase the accessibility and mobility options available to people
       and for freight;
    4. Protect and enhance the environment, promote energy conservation,
       and improve quality of life;
    5. Enhance the integration and connectivity of the transportation
       system, across and between modes, for people and freight;
    6. Promote efficient system management and operation; and
    7. Emphasize the preservation of the existing transportation system.

   Regarding the promotion of efficient system management and operation...

   Transportation planners and providers working to improve their mutual
   interests must grapple with diverse issues. The organizational issues
   are important both in terms of agency interaction and in how decisions
   are supported and made. Technical issues remain regarding the
   availability of good data to support estimates of system performance
   and in using emerging methods to acquire data. Key analytical issues
   lie in determining how valuable management programs and actions are or
   may be in the future. Despite the obstacles, well-formed regional
   transportation management programs are taking shape across the country
   and making a difference. Going forward as partners in an evolving
   discipline, transportation planners, managers and operators can
   continue to provide world-class transportation infrastructure and
   services needed by the citizenry of our diverse and growing nation.
