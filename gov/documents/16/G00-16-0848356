                        The Last Universal Physicist

                        by Chris Quigg

   Enrico Fermi On the occasion of his one hundredth birthday, we honor a
   great scientist who was born in Italy, made immense and lasting
   contributions to the birth of modern physics, and emigrated to the
   United States, where he carried out experiments and theoretical studies
   that ushered in the atomic age.

   Enrico Fermi was born in Rome on September 29, 1901, and received his
   doctorate from the University of Pisa in 1922. After fellowships in
   GÃ¶ttingen and Leiden, he lectured for two years at the University of
   Florence. In 1927, Fermi was elected the first professor of theoretical
   physics at the University of Rome, where he attracted a brilliant group
   of students and collaborators.

   The scientific work of Fermi and his circle influenced an astonishing
   range of topics, many of which are of high interest in the year 2001.
   An uncanny instinct for the most important questions and a remarkable
   gift for simple, direct explanations are hallmarks of Fermi's
   contributions. Scientists hold him in awe as "the last universal
   physicist."

   In a lifetime of scientific achievement, Enrico Fermi's work on
   neutrons and radioactivity had perhaps the broadest impact. Following
   the observation of artificial radioactivity, Fermi found that nuclear
   transmutation occurs in nearly every element bombarded by neutrons.
   That work led him to discover the special effectiveness of slow
   neutrons for inducing nuclear transformations, which in turn led to the
   discovery of nuclear fission and the production of artificial elements.

   Enrico Fermi was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his
   neutron research. He and his family used the occasion of the Nobel
   ceremony to escape the tightening grip of fascism; he joined the tide
   of illustrious immigrants who transformed the American scientific
   community, taking a professorship at Columbia University.

   In the discovery of fission, Fermi saw the possibility that the
   emission of secondary neutrons could sustain a chain reaction. With
   tremendous enthusiasm and his characteristic clarity of thought, he
   directed a series of classic experiments that eventually led to the
   atomic pile and the first controlled nuclear chain reaction, observed
   by his team on December 2, 1942 in Chicago.

   Fermi became an American citizen in 1944. For the next two years, he
   served as Associate Director of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in
   New Mexico, and was among the witnesses to the first nuclear explosion
   in the Alamogordo desert. At the end of the war, Fermi accepted a
   position at the Institute for Nuclear Studies at the University of
   Chicago, where he established another great school of physics. Until
   his death in 1954, his main scientific interest was in the new field of
   particle physics.

   Fermi's contributions to science, teaching, and public service make him
   a continuing inspiration to other scientists and to young people today.
   His name lives on in the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of
   Chicago, where the range of superb scientific research carries on his
   legacy; the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), in
   Batavia, Illinois, the particle physics laboratory that is home to the
   world's most powerful accelerator; and the Fermi Award, a Presidential
   award that is one of the oldest and most prestigious science and
   technology honors given by the United States government.

   At Fermilab this week, we commemorate the life and work of this
   outstanding scientist and great American citizen.
