   Subject: In-flight Aviation Weather Advisories

   References: WSOM Chapter D-22, Transmittal Issuance 91-7 dated May 22,
   1991.

   Effective 0800 UTC, July 1, 1996, a series of changes became effective
   that resulted in the complete implementation of the new worldwide
   observation (METAR) and forecast (TAF) codes in the U.S. This
   implementation affects not only the METAR and TAF but also all aviation
   forecasts and warnings as well as pilot reports. Specifically this OML
   affects the SIGMET and Convective SIGMET issued within the domestic
   U.S. flight information region (FIR) as well as the AIRMET prepared in
   the Contiguous U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii.

   The new code is a merging of the North American and international
   codes. A complete description of the new code, using U.S. procedures,
   is described in the new WSOM chapter D-31, entitled Aviation Terminal
   Forecasts, which became effective on July 1.

   It should be noted that the changes are required to accompany the
   implementation of the METAR and TAF and thus affect terminology and
   format of the descriptive weather forecast text. In due course, the
   SIGMET, Convective SIGMET, and AIRMET will also be revised to
   accommodate some additional changes as required in the International
   Civil Aviation Organization, Annex 3, Standards and Recommended
   Practices, Amendment 70.

   The following changes went into effect on July 1, 1996.

   TERMINOLOGY CHANGES Domestic and international products shall use the
   METAR/TAF terminology in the descriptive weather forecast text only.
   That is, changes affecting communications and processing shall not be
   implemented.

   Descriptive weather forecast text:

       a.     Use new terminology as described in this OML and WSOM
   chapter D-31, became effective July 1, 1996.

       b.     Use international abbreviations/contractions for words other
   than those used in the METAR and TAF as listed in the FAA contractions
   Handbook. 7340.1.

       c.     Use available 4-letter location identifiers.

       d.     Alter the designation of cloud, icing, and turbulence bases
   and tops in text products. The old sequence consisted of:

   base/range height, amount or intensity, and top/range height and the
   new sequence is:

   amount or intensity, base/range height, and TOPS FL top/range using
   3-digits for all heights.

   Examples:

                           Old
                                               New
                           70BKN200
                                               BKN070 TOPS FL200
                           70-90 SCT-BKN120-150
                                               SCT-BKN070-090 TOPS 120-150

   Flight level (FL), by definition is used only for 18,000 feet and
   above. FL is also voiced, as instructed, by the FAA as per the
   definition. Hence, the "FL" notation shall be used for altitude
   references   for 18.000 feet and above. The exception is CLOUD bases.

   Communications and processing purposes:

   a.    retain 3-letter location identifiers,

   b.    retain coastal waters contractions and 2-letter state and great
   lakes identifiers, and

   c.    retain 3-letter VOR identifiers.

   Specific changes:

   Specific changes are listed in the three attachments to this OML. As
   such they shall be applied to area forecast preparation.

     Attachment 1, is the significant present and forecast weather Code
     Table 4678 as included in WSOM Chapter D-31.

     Attachment 2, is a selected list of contractions and abbreviated
     main language terms used in the METAR and TAF.

     Attachment 3, is an example of an area forecast product showing the
     chances addressed in this OML.

         SELECTED CONTRACTIONS AND ABBREVIATED PLAIN LANGUAGE TERMS
                          USED IN AVIATION PRODUCTS

  BECMG  Indicator of a change (becoming) at either a regular or irregular
         rate
  BKN    Broken cloud layer (5 to 7 oktas cloud amount). (Lowest broken,
         overcast layer or vertical visibility is implied to be the ceiling.)
  FEW    Few clouds (<1okta to 2 oktas cloud amount)
  FMGGgg From the time (UTC/Z) indicated by GGgg (hour and minute)
  NIL    No or None or I have nothing to send you

         Table 4678 (Appendix C), are forecast to end
  OVC    Overcast (8/8 cloud amount)

         meteorological phenomenon (na)
  P6SM   Visibility forecast greater than (Plus) 6 statue miles

  SKC    Sky clear (cloud amount, if any, expected to be 0 oktas). The
         contraction CLR is not used in forecasts.
  SM     Statute mile
  TAF    Aerodrome forecast
  TEMPO  Indicator of temporary change

         Time - UTC) appended to the time group
  Some expressions -- short words, in common English, for which there are
  no ICAO contractions -- are completely spelled out, e.g., "AND" AND
  "WIND".  "TO" and "NIL" are both listed in the ICAO contraction manual
  and common words in English.
