   The new e-mail list distribution service known as Listserv further
   enhances the quality of government services at Washington state's web
   portal, Access Washington. With this service, citizens will be able to
   keep up with the latest developments and news from government agencies
   and to participate in discussion groups for the issues and topics of
   interest to them via e-mail. The service will also enable state and
   local government agencies to reach out directly to businesses,
   organizations and the general public in a much quicker and more
   efficient manner.

   The Listserv is free to citizens. You are welcome to participate in the
   lists currently available at listserv.wa.gov.

   To learn more about what listserv can do for you, please download
   "Introduction to Listserv". ( Microsoft PowerPoint file ). Any employee
   of public entity who has been authorized by his/her agency in the state
   of Washington is eligible to start a list and become a list owner for a
   monthly service fee.
