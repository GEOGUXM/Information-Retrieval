    PLEASE NOTE: The WIMS/NIFMID update to the new database is scheduled
   for February, 2-4 2002. The WIMS, AMIS, KCFAST and FIRESTAT data upload
     applications will be unavailable from Saturday, February 2 at 0001
   until Monday, February 4 at 0800 central time. Please contact the Fire
      Applications Helpdesk (800-253-5559) immediately if you have any

   Wims Legacy (the old way of using WIMS) will be retired on February 1,
                                    2002.

                  WIMS web has been updated to version 1.04

    WIMS web is experiencing the logon problem again. Please take care in
                           logging into WIMS web.

   Please remember, your WIMS web password is NOT the same as your legacy
                                WIMS account.

   Forest Service users of FIRESTAT will be able to maintain their legacy
     WIMS PASSWORD through the TN3270 program. The 30 day password limit
       will continue to exist for these accounts. This only applies to
      allowing the FIRESTAT user to upload their fires into the NIFMID
                                  database.

     See the password explanation below if you are experiencing problems
               logging on to any of the FAM Web applications.

     If you experience any problems please contact the F&AM Helpdesk at
                               1-800-253-5559.

                      * * * Password explanation * * *

      A little explanation of passwords for Legacy WIMS, and the FAMWEB
                                applications.
   There are three separate systems sharing two databases. There are three
   places to manage the passwords for these applications. We have tried to
                      keep the confusion to a minimum.
     * Legacy WIMS: A character based application used to manage weather
       information. If your KC Logon ID (kclid) is "BLM0001", the password
       for this account is managed when you logon to the legacy WIMS
       system (prior to the introduction of the web based version of
       WIMS). This password is associated with the IBM Mainframe access.
     * WIMS web, KCFAST and AMIS: The web based application used to manage
       the weather information and retrieve historic weather and fire
       data. AMIS is the Forest Service historical aircraft usage
       database. To access these applications use your KC Logon ID with an
       "ops$" prefix. So if your old WIMS KC Logon Id is "blm0001", the
       web username is "ops$blm0001". This password is managed with the
       FAMWEB password link to the left. This is an oracle database
       username and password, which uses the same database used by the
       legacy WIMS system.
     * Sit Report and 209: Starting Wednesday, August 1, 2001, these
       applications will start using a separate oracle database. If your
       KC Logon ID is "blm0001", the username will be "ops$blm0001". This
       password will be managed with the SIT password link to the left.
       With this being a new oracle database, it has its own password
       management system. Initially your Sit Report password will be the
       same as the WIMS web password. If you change the WIMS web password
       you may want to change your Sit Report password to match.
