   The Insurance Commissioner's Office participated in a national
   campaign, GET SMART week, Jan. 14-18, to raise consumer awareness of
   their insurance coverage. Washington state consumers are urged to
   double-check their insurance regularly to ensure they have the coverage
   they need.

   Both homeowner and auto insurance rates are on the rise nationally, and
   here in Washington state. Although the Office of the Insurance
   Commissioner will continue to closely scrutinize all rate increase
   requests, Washington state is not immune from the national trend.

   OIC has also developed fact sheets on this issue for both homeowner and
   auto insurance.
