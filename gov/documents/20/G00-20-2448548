              California Regulations Amended September 18, 2000

      The latest update to our regulations is now available, including
     changes to implement Assembly Bill 431 (Stats. 1999, c. 974), which
   increased licensing fees, reduced the term of licensure and deleted the
       continuing education requirement to take the four-hour laws and
       regulations class. The regulation changes also reduced several
       miscellaneous fees to more accurately reflect current costs of
                             providing services.
