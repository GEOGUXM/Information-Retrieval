   Now's the Time for you to Practice Pollution Prevention (P2) !
   __________________________________________________________________

   Ever wonder how you can help the Bay Area avoid rolling power blackouts
   that threaten us, and also reduce air pollution at the same time?
   There are ways: reduce the amount of electricity you use, and switch to
   more energy-efficient equipment.

   Ever wonder how you can improve air quality and help prevent Spare the
   Air days that threaten our health?  There are ways: two of them are to
   reduce driving, and avoid using products that emit pollutants.

   The best ways to reduce pollution, as noted in the examples shown
   above, are to simply prevent it from happening in the first place.
   National Pollution Prevention Week is September 17-23, 2001.  Whether
   you read this material during that Week or afterwards, it's always a
   good time to get started thinking, and begin doing Pollution Prevention
   (P2).  P2 can help reduce health threats to you and your family.

   Can you reduce the usage of materials that cause pollution?  Can you
   switch to different materials that are less harmful to the
   environment?  Can you reduce the amount of energy you use?  These are
   some ways you can help prevent pollution.  Remember, it's not just
   companies that can reduce pollution.  We, as individuals, also
   contribute to pollution as we go about the ordinary tasks of our daily
   lives (e.g., through the use of cleaners, personal care products,
   insecticides, etc.) so we, too, can take steps to reduce pollution.

   The individual actions taken by each one of us add up.  Together, the
   combined impact can help make noticeable improvements to the
   environment we live in.

   Here are some web sites that provide good information about pollution
   prevention.  Check them out, and be sure to pass the information on to
   others.

   The National Pollution Prevention Roundtable, at www.p2.org, is a good
   starting point.  It has links to various P2 topics including P2 Week,
   and it also provides examples of P2 activities.

   The California Department of Toxic Substances Control, at
   www.dtsc.ca.gov/sppt/pptd/pp/, has information on its P2 program, P2
   Week and other P2 resources.

   The Association of Bay Area Governments, at
   http://greenbiz.abag.ca.gov/BGRewarding.html, has information on
   running a "Green Business" in the Bay Area, and it covers P2 and energy
   efficiency.
