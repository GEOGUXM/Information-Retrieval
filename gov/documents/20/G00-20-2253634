                  Dover Township, Ocean County, New Jersey

   The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS), with
   support from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
   (ATSDR), is conducting an epidemiologic study of childhood cancers in
   Dover Township, Ocean County, New Jersey.

   In 1996, ATSDR and NJDHSS developed a Public Health Response Plan in
   cooperation with the Ocean County Health Department and the Citizens
   Action Committee on Childhood Cancer Cluster. The plan outlined a
   series of public health activities including assessments of potential
   environmental exposures in the community. In 1997, ATSDR and NJDHSS
   determined that an epidemiologic study was warranted, and that the
   study would include assessments of the potential for exposure to
   specific drinking-water sources. For more information on additional
   public health activities, including the Case-Control Study of Childhood
   Cancer in Dover Township, New Jersey, please see the State of New
   Jersey's web site.

   To assist the epidemiologic efforts, ATSDR developed a work plan to
   reconstruct historical characteristics of the water-distribution system
   serving the Dover Township area by using water-distribution system
   modeling techniques. Using collected data, the water-distribution
   system model was calibrated to present-day (1998) conditions. ATSDR
   released a report and a technical paper in June 2000 describing the
   field-data collection activities and model calibration results. Below
   are links to the historical report, summary of findings and the
   complete report.
