                 Legislature Revises Public Accountancy Act

   On May 14, 2001 Governor Locke signed Engrossed Second Substitute
   Senate Bill 5593* amending the Public Accountancy Act (RCW 18.04).

   Nearly all of the Board's rules were impacted.  At a special Board
   meeting on Friday, July 13, the Board drafted amendments to 38 of its
   rules, four new rules, and the repeal of two rules to implement the
   revisions to the Public Accountancy Act.

   The Board held three public rule-making hearings around the State
   during August and September to provide stakeholders an opportunity to
   submit oral input to proposed amendments to its rules.

   On September 21, 2001, given the number and complexity of the issues
   and the number of valuable comments received, the Board moved to defer
   action on all proposed rules considered during the August and September
   2001 public rule-making hearings and to form a small workgroup to
   redraft the rule proposals.

   The Board will announce the schedule for another rule-making hearing(s)
   after its regular meeting scheduled for October 26, 2001.
