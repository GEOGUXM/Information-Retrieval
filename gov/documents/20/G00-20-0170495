         The National Weather Service's Cooperative Observer Program
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Cooperative Observers Climatological Network was created in 1880.
   The program is currently administered by the National Weather Service,
   a line office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
   an agency within the Department of Commerce. One of the
   responsibilities of the National Weather Service is to take
   meteorological observations which are used to record the climate of the
   United States. The National Weather Service relies heavily on a vast
   network of cooperative observer volunteers to achieve this objective.

   The National Weather Service determines where observations are needed
   and furnishes standard meteorological instruments to individuals who
   volunteer their time to take and record daily observations of the
   weather. Currently, there are about 8000 published volunteer observing
   stations located in the United States and its territories. In addition
   to the thousands of cooperative observation stations operated by
   individuals, many are maintained by institutions and commerical firms
   such as universities and utility companies. All cooperative observers
   submit a monthly report summarizing daily weather observations. These
   contributions to the climate record of the United States are
   invaluable.
