    VISION: Aerospace Safety Through Excellence in Medical Certification
     MISSION: Timely and Accurate Medical Certification Services to the
                             Aerospace Community

          To keep aviation safe, health standards must be determined and
          maintained for all pilots. About a half-million medical
          certificates are issued each year on the basis of physical
          examinations, all of which require prompt review by the
          Aerospace Medical Certification's medical staff. The Aerospace
          Medical Certification Enterprise System computers and huge data
          base help the staff to quickly, fairly, and responsibly evaluate
          the 1,900 applications received daily.
