     On March 4, 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt signed "a bill to
     divide the State of Texas into four judicial districts," creating
     the Southern District of Texas.

                                             Justice Lies in the District
                                                        by Charles Zelden

   The first federal judge in Texas was John C. Watrous, a Houston lawyer
   appointed on May 26, 1846, to hold court in Galveston, with original
   jurisdiction over the whole state, the District of Texas. Judge Watrous
   had previously been Attorney General of the Republic of Texas. On
   February 21, 1857, the state was divided into two districts, Eastern
   and Western, with Judge Watrous continuing to serve in the Eastern
   district. Judge Watrous and Judge Thomas H. DuVal, in the Western
   District of Texas, left the state upon the secession of Texas from the
   Union, the only two United States Judges not to resign their posts in
   any state that seceded. When Texas was restored to the Union, Judge
   Watrous resumed his duties and served until 1870. Judge Amos Morrill
   served in the Eastern District of Texas from 1872 to 1884. He was
   succeeded by Chauncy B. Sabin (1884 to 1890) and David E. Bryant (1890
   to 1902). In 1902, the Southern District of Texas was created by Act of
   Congress, and Judge Bryant continued to serve in the Eastern District
   of Texas until 1910.

   Since its foundation, the Southern District of Texas has been served by
   forty District Judges and six Clerks of Court. Additional information
   is available on Bankruptcy Judges, Magistrate Judges and the Divisional
   Offices.

   The Southern District of Texas started with one judge, Waller T. Burns,
   and a Clerk of Court, Christopher Dart. Since that time, the court has
   grown to eighteen district judgeships, six bankruptcy judgeships,
   fourteen magistrate judgeships, and over 200 deputy clerks. These dates
   are some of the events:

          a fine of $10,000. Ali did not fight again until October 1970,
