      The CDF Office of the State Fire Marshal functions in three basic ways:
      by regulating buildings in which people live, congregate, or are
      confined; by controlling substances and products which may, in and of
      themselves, or by their misuse, cause injuries, death, and destruction
      by fire; and by providing training and education in fire protection
      methods and responsibilities. Reduced to its simplest terms, the
      function of the State Fire Marshal is fire prevention. That function is
      accomplished through several major program elements including code
      enforcement, training, engineering, hazmat safety, and fire incident
      reporting.

      examination process typically consists of an oral interview. Incumbents
      in this classification are designated peace officers, either under
