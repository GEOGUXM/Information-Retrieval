   Welcome
   T he California Architects Board (CAB) was created in 1901 by the
   California Legislature to protect the health, safety, and welfare of
   the public through the regulation of the practice of architecture in
   California. It is one of numerous boards, bureaus, commissions, and
   committees within the Department of Consumer Affairs responsible for
   consumer protection and the regulation of licensed professionals. CAB
   establishes regulations for examination and licensing of the profession
   of architecture in California, which today numbers approximately 24,000
   licensed architects and approximately 4,000 candidates who are in the
   process of meeting examination and licensure requirements.
