                          Polar Ecosystems Program


   The NMML Polar Ecosystems Program conducts pinniped and seabird
   research in Arctic, sub-Arctic, and Antarctic marine ecosystems. The
   underlying objectives of this research are to determine what factors
   are primarily responsible for influencing the population dynamics of
   polar pinnipeds. Current studies focus on feeding ecology, reproductive
   success, growth and condition, demography, abundance, prey
   availability, and environmental conditions. Sub-Arctic research is
   focused on Alaska harbor seals throughout their entire geographic
   range. Research on Arctic ice seals (ringed, bearded, spotted, and
   ribbon seals) include surveys, behavioral studies utilizing
   satellite-linked transmitters, and monitoring of subsistence harvests
   by Alaska Natives. Studies of Antarctic ecosystems have been under way
   for more than a decade but have shifted from fur seal and seabird
   investigations to work more focused on ice seals, which provides
   valuable ecological comparisons with Arctic ice seal studies. These
   research projects are designed to detect significant changes in
   pinniped status and trends and the ecosystems of which they are a part,
   and to distinguish between changes due to commercial fisheries and
   those due to natural causes.

   The three principal research areas within the Polar Ecosystems Program
   are:
    1. Alaska harbor seals
    2. Arctic ice seals
    3. Antarctic ecosystems
