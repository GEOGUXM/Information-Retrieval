   The New England HIDTA was established in 1999 and includes the
   following Connecticut counties: Fairfield, Hartford, and New Haven. The
   thousands of miles of coastline and the vast, desolate, U.S./Canadian
   border provide extensive opportunities for drug smuggling into the New
   England Region. ÿ The Connecticut Alcohol and Drug Policy Council4 This
   council is charged with examining and improving the statewide substance
   abuse system and developing plan and action strategies to reduce the
   harmful effects of this problem. The Council is organized into three
   major working committees (prevention, treatment, and criminal justice)
   to support coordinated planning. Each of these committees has ad hoc
   workgroups to address specific challenges. The prevention, treatment
   and criminal justice committees each develop their own specific vision,
   goals and objectives. ÿ Governor's Prevention Initiative for Youth5

   of Connecticut in July 1998 from the Center for Substance Abuse
   Prevention (CSAP). ÿ Executive Office of Weed and Seed (EOWS)6 * New
   Britain: The target area for this Weed and Seed site is the Broad and
   North Street neighborhood, which has the city's highest crime rate.
   This neighborhood is the poorest, most culturally diverse, and densely
   populated area in the city. * New Haven: The target area for this site
   is an area of the city known as Fair Haven. The Fair Haven Weed and
   Seed Law Enforcement Strategy is a two- pronged approach: to address
   the most severe violent crimes by increasing investigations of
   narcotics trafficking and violent felons; and to expand walking ONDCP

   noise, auto theft, graffiti, and prostitution. * Bridgeport: There are
   two target areas for this site, the East Side and East End
   neighborhoods. The East Side neighborhood has a large Hispanic
   population and has experienced the city's highest rates of crime,

   East End neighborhood suffers from the city's second highest homicide
   levels. This area also experiences a high level of gang violence and
