   The Electronic Forms System (NEFS) is a suite of tools for filling out,
    signing, submitting, archiving, and tracking electronic forms Â– all
                        using your desktop computer.

   The NEFS uses a commercial software application from Shana Corporation
       called Informed Filler to access electronic form capabilities.

   All users must install the NEFS software which includes a complete user
               guide. Then look here for your favorite forms.
