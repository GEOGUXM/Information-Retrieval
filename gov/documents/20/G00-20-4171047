   Learning from others' experiences can be key to success! On these pages
   you will find information on niche market applications for alternative
   fuel vehicles (AFVs). You will be able to see how other fleets use AFVs
                and learn who you can contact to get started.

    The U.S. Department of Energy's Clean Cities National Partner Awards
      recognize companies, organization s, cities, and states for their
   outstanding contributions to the growth of the AFV market. Winners, who
    are nominated by Clean Cities program managers, receive the awards at
     the National Clean Cities Conference. See National Partner Awards.

   We want to hear from you! If you have successfully implemented AFVs in
    a fleet, tell us your story. And if you are having difficulty, let us
                         know so we can try to help!
