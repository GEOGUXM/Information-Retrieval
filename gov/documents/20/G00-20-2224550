Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle (DOQ)

   A Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle (DOQ) is a digital, uniform-scale image
   created from aerial photos. It is a photographic map in which ground
   features are displayed in their true ground position because relief
   displacements caused by the camera and terrain of an aerial photograph
   have been removed. It combines the image characteristics of a
   photograph with the geometric qualities of a map; thus, it is possible
   to get direct measurements of distances, areas, angles, and positions
   from a DOQ.

   What is the difference between an aerial photograph and an orthophoto?
    1. A conventional perspective aerial photograph contains image
       displacements caused by the tilting of the camera and terrain
       relief (topography). It does not have a uniform scale. You cannot
       measure distances on an aerial photograph like you can on a map. It
       is not a map.
    2. The effects of tilt and relief are removed from the aerial
       photograph by a computer rectification process to create an
       orthophoto.
    3. An orthophoto is a uniform-scale photograph. It is a photographic
       map.
    4. Since an orthophoto has a uniform scale, it is possible to measure
       directly on it like other maps.
    5. An orthophoto may serve as a base map onto which other map
       information may be overlain.

   A standard DOQ is distributed in a quarter section of a standard
   7.5-minute quadrangles. The one meter resolution of the DOQ results in
   a very large file size. Each quarter quadrangle DOQ is ~50MB; the
   complete mosaicked DOQ for the Lake Tahoe Basin is ~3GB.

   DOQs are often compressed with JPEG compression, but for distribution
   here, all the DOQs for the Lake Tahoe Basin have been mosaicked
   together and compressed with MrSID compression from footer image.
   LizardTech. The compressed MrSID file has been reduced from ~3GB to
   ~144MB, which is still too large for convenient download over a modem.
   Viewers are available for free from LizardTech on their website.

   DOQ of Basin Lake Tahoe.
   Patterns in the lake is an artifact of the camera.

   DOQs are in UTM NAD27 zone 10 projection. Raw (original) data are in
   the following projections: data east of 120 degrees longitude are in
   UTM zone 11 and data west of 120 degrees longitude are in UTM zone 10.
   It is not possible to combine different projections in Geographic
   Information System (GIS), therefore, all data have been reprojected
   into one standard projection, UTM NAD27 zone 10 projection, for the
   Lake Tahoe Basin.

   DOQ mosaics of the Lake Tahoe Basin:

     DOQ for 1992, sid and sdw files
     (141 MB compressed).

     DOQ for 1998, sid and sdw files
     (123 MB compressed).

     DOQ Metadata.

   WARNING! For ArcView users of MrSID images: Some installations of
   ArcView 3.2 overwrite the old versions of a MrSID dll file. The new dll
   file makes the mistake of reading positional information for the MrSID
   file itself instead of the world file as it is supposed to. Click Here
   to download a zip file of the new .dll file that lets the MrSID images
   reference according to what is in the SDW file for ArcView 3.2. The
   file is called AVMrSID.dll and should replace the file with the same
   name in d:\ESRI\Av_gis30\ArcView\Bin32 (replace "d:" with the correct
   drive for your machine).
