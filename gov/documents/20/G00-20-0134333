   The Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) is part of the
   World Climate Photo of cummulus and K-band radar. Research Program.
   Although clouds, through radiative and hydrological effects, are a
   major element in governing climate, their influences on global climate
   are not well established quantitatively. Millimeter-wave radar is one
   promising tool that can provide detailed information on the altitudes,
   thicknesses, and reflectivities of single and multiple cloud layers.
   Global coverage of three-dimensional cloud conditions is expected to
   become a reality in the next decade when cloud radars are operated from
   satellites. ETL is analyzing its extensive "climatology" of
   ground-based cloud observations obtained with its NOAA/K radar during
   several recent field projects ( Arizona 95, ASTEX, FIRE-II ) in
   different parts of the world to determine the sensitivity and
   resolution that a satellite-borne radar will need in order to detect a
   specified percentage of all clouds.
