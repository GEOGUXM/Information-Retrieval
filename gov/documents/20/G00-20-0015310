   Center. This site also provides links to other NASA image Web sites.
   An Associate of Arts in Community Colleges for Training in Earth
   Science (ACTES) is a collaboration between the College of San Mateo
   (CSM) and NASA Ames Research Center. The project established an Earth
   Science Department at CSM through which an AA degree is offered and
   from which course credits can be transferred to senior universities.
   The courses use remote-sensing data collected by NASA Earth scientists
   and teach data visualization, geographic information systems, and
   global positioning technology. These courses, data and other curriculum
   materials are available to community colleges via the Web. Contact:
   Kenneth Kennedy; William Runberg or Jay Skiles.
