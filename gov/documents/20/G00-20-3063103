   report is one of a series that examines regional telecom/IT markets in
   Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia. It is based on field research
   and analysis carried out in the spring of 2000 by IT specialist Raymond
   Cho (Office of Information Technologies) and telecom services
   specialist Daniel W. Edwards (Office of Telecommunications
   Technologies) of the International Trade Administration, United States
   Department of Commerce. They interviewed IT and telecom producers,
   service suppliers and customers, foreign government officials, regional
   and trade association officials, and industry experts in Gaborone,
   Botswana, and Johannesburg, Pretoria and Durban, South Africa. The work
   was actively supported by Department of Commerce's Foreign Commercial
   Service (FCS) officials and market specialists in South Africa and by
   the State Department's economics/commercial officer in Botswana. This
   report focuses on the status of the telecommunications infrastructure
   and services and on existing and potential IT industries and markets,
   with special attention given to factors influencing the adoption of the
   Internet and electronic commerce in the area. It is hoped that this
   report will prove useful in highlighting potential commercial
   opportunities for U.S. telecom and IT firms in an area of the world
   that is often overlooked and overshadowed by larger and better-known IT
   and telecom markets where U.S. firms may have been involved for several
   years. 1 Office of Information Technologies / Telecommunications
   Technologies, USDOC, December 2000 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Southern Africa is
   a region of tremendous needs, vast potential, and future commercial
   opportunities for those telecommunications and IT companies that have
   the vision and commitment to engage themselves in those markets and
   stay the course. In general, Southern Africa is also an area about
   which many of us in the United States, including politicians,
   government officials, and business executives, know too little.
   Unfortunately, mainstream news reports inevitably focus on conflicts,
   crises, or natural disasters. Less well understood are the political
   and economic transformations underway that will bring great changes to
   Southern Africa during the coming decade. That there remain daunting
   challenges and problems in the region cannot be denied. That there is a
   general acceptance there of the urgent need to expand the
   telecommunications networks and develop creative IT solutions must also
   be acknowledged. This report, based upon field research and the
   insights of local business leaders, African officials, and U.S.
   Government experts serving in Africa, seeks to lay out some of the
   current realities and scope for potential activities by U.S. firms in
   the telecom/IT markets in Southern Africa, particularly South Africa
   and Botswana. In some respects, South Africa is atypical in that its
   telecom/IT markets are far larger and more developed than those of its
   regional neighbors. In other ways, however, South Africa faces many of
   the same challenges: how to further privatize and introduce competition
   into its market; how to expand network access to geographical areas and
   populations with no such access today; and how to develop and implement
   IT solutions that will promote the social development of all citizens
   as well as allow businesses to operate more productively. Botswana is
   also atypical of many African countries in that it has a small
   population and a relatively high standard of living for a large section
   of its populace. But it, too, is considering how best to leverage the
   possibilities of new communications technologies. Many areas of the IT
   markets of Southern Africa have yet to be developed. Companies new to
   these markets will be true pioneers. In many cases, it is difficult to
   predict just when and to what extent particular IT solutions will work
   in the marketplace. Again, certain sectors of South Africa's business
   and residential markets are likely to closely follow currents trends in
   the IT markets of Europe and the United States. Activities in the IT
   sector of the South African market, and the markets of other countries
   in the region, are just beginning to emerge. Electronic commerce, for
   example, is still an idea, with limited if any real-world applications,
   in much of that region. But as the telecom infrastructure is rolled out
   and as use of the Internet takes hold and expands, the market for
   IT-related products and services will grow accordingly. In
   telecommunications, typical opportunities include establishing a joint
   venture to provide telecom services, often in response to a formal
   bidding process, and selling all types of telecommunications equipment
   (switches, optical fiber, satellite earth stations, cellular phones,
   etc.) to both government- owned and newer privately-held companies. In
   the IT sector, around 50 percent of Botswana and South Africa's markets
   are comprised of public-sector sales. There is strong demand for
   enterprise- class systems and integration services, as well as
   networking equipment and Internet-related software and services. Growth
   in the personal computer market for small- to medium-sized businesses
   remains robust. 2 Office of Information Technologies /
   Telecommunications Technologies, USDOC, December 2000 For U.S. IT SMEs,
   local experts suggest that partnering with either an established or
   new-to-market African firm or systems integrator is one of the best
   routes to penetrate the market. Other options include the use of agents
   and distributors for selected products. Regardless of market entry
   strategy, there are public and private-sector agencies in both Africa
   and the United States that are eager to assist U.S. SMEs in their
   market entry endeavors. 3 Office of Information Technologies /
