   Lab physicists named APS fellows

   By Elizabeth Campos Rajs
   Newsline staff writer
   Four Lab physicists have been named fellows of the American Physical
   Society.
   Peter Beiersdorfer of V Division, Siegfried Glenzer of the National
   Ignition Facility, David Munro of X Division, and Karl van Bibber of
   the Physics and Advanced Technologies Diectorate are among the 190 new
   fellows named this year. Each year, no more than one-half of one
   percent of the current APS membership are elected to the status of
   fellow.
   The APS recognizes those who have made advances in knowledge through
   original research or made significant innovative contributions in the
   application of physics to science and technology.
   Peter Beiersdorfer, group leader for Atomic Spectroscopy in V Division,
   was cited for his many contributions to precision X-ray spectroscopy
   of highly charged systems and application of this spectroscopy to
   plasma and astrophysical problems.
   Its great, he said of the award. Its a great honor to be selected.
   I was surprised and very happy when I received the letter two weeks
   ago.
   Beiersdorfer, who joined the Laboratory in 1988, earned his bachelors
   and masters degrees in physics at Auburn University and his masters
   and Ph.D. in plasma physics at Princeton University.
   Siegfried Glenzer, an experimental physicist at the Lab, was cited for
   the development of Thomson Scattering for the diagnostics of
   high-temperature inertial confinement fusion plasmas and for important
   contributions to understanding of plasma waves, atomic physics, and
   hydrodynamics of hot dense plasmas.
   Im happy about the award, said Glenzer, who was presented his
   certificate at the annual APS Division of Plasma Physics meeting in
   November. It shows people know about your work and think its
   important. Some of this work was on Nova. Nova was hard work. Its nice
   to be recognized for it.
   Glenzer, who is the Plasma Physics Group leader in Inertial Confinement
   Fusion, earned his undergraduate degree and Ph.D. at the
   Ruhr-Universitat-Bochum in Germany. He has been in the United States
   since 1994, when he first joined the Lab as a postdoc.
   Munro, who has worked at the Lab for 21 years, is a physicist in X
   Division and is involved in laser fusion target design. He was cited
   for seminal contributions to the design of laser-driven
   Rayleigh-Taylor experiments, and to the analysis and design of
   shock-timing experiments for cryogenic inertial confinement fusion
   targets.
   Its a nice recognition both of me and the work we do at the Lab in X
   Division, Munro said. Its an honor not only for me, but for the
   people working with me.
   Munro joined the Lab in 1980, shortly after earning his Ph.D. at the
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His Lab career has been focused
   on laser fusion and until a few years ago, mostly involved designing
   experiments on Nova. Currently, he is involved in target design work
   for NIF.
   Karl van Bibber, chief scientist in the Physics and Advanced
   Technologies Directorate, was cited for his leadership role in an
   ultra-sensitive search for dark-matter axions, and the conception of
   other elegant experiments for detection of the axion.
   I was stunned when I heard about it, said van Bibber. Its a great
   honor. The dark matter problem is one of the greatest challenges in
   science, and the award is a tribute to the Labs commitment to basic
   research and the efforts of our entire team who have contributed to
   this experiment.
   Van Bibber received his bachelors and doctorate at MIT, and came to
   the Laboratory in 1985 from Stanford where he had been an assistant
   professor of physics. He started the high energy physics and
   accelerator technology group in 1991, and was the Laboratorys project
   leader for the construction of the SLAC/LBNL/LLNL B Factory.
