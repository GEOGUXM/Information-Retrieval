       Project Update:
       December 2001
       _______________________________________________________________________

       View the three conceptual alternatives selected on October 15, 2001.

   Background
   There is an urgent need to replace the 48-year old Alaskan Way Viaduct
   (SR99) because of its age, seismic vulnerability, and critical role in
   the region's transportation system. WSDOT and the City of Seattle have
   joined to conduct an intensive and expedited study of options to either
   retrofit or replace the viaduct as soon as possible. The study results,
   including environmental impact information, will be used to make
   project decisions and begin preliminary design with an aggressive goal
   of entering a design-build RFP contract in late 2003.
   The Alaskan Way Viaduct carries significant traffic in and out of
   downtown Seattle and also serves as a major corridor for
   through-traffic. Built in 1953 with a capacity of 65,000 vehicles per
   day, the viaduct today carries up to 110,000 vehicles per day. That is
   almost a third of the volume of traffic on I-5, the other major
   corridor through downtown Seattle. Shippers and haulers, transit
   riders, and auto commuters all rely on the viaduct.
   Age and obsolescence are major issues for the viaduct. Damage to the
   viaduct from the Nisqually earthquake in February 2001 underscored its
   seismic vulnerability and created widespread recognition of the urgent
   need to retrofit or replace the structure. Also of concern is the
   relationship between the viaduct and the City of Seattle seawall area
   along the city waterfront; the seawall's condition could have an effect
   on how the viaduct program should be defined and carried out.
   Following the earthquake both WSDOT and an independent expert panel
   conducted a structural review and seismic assessments of the viaduct
   that was delivered in June 2001. Meanwhile, WSDOT contracted for
   emergency repairs to be performed at a cost of approximately $2
   million. The repair program, largely complete, necessitated vehicle
   weight restrictions and frequent traffic closures on the viaduct that
   inconvenienced the public, especially truckers and bus riders who were
   displaced from their normal routes for extended periods.
   A Unique Community Planning Process
   Mayor Paul Schell and Transportation Secretary Doug MacDonald have
   convened a volunteer leadership team of civic, business, freight, and
   neighborhood representatives to serve as a sounding board in an
   expedited process. This process will develop and refine engineering and
   design solutions for the corridor in parallel with preparation of an
   environmental impact statement.
   Some of the important planning issues include the connections that the
   viaduct makes to north and south sections of SR 99, as well as to
   critical arterials serving downtown and neighborhoods. The Colman Dock
   ferry terminal, and rail, truck, and ocean freight shipping terminals
   and yards are among the important transportation facilities the viaduct
   serves.
   Public Involvement
   The viaduct planning process involves many opportunities for public
   participation. This includes public meetings and workshops, community
   briefings, information materials, and this website. If you would like
   to schedule a presentation or share your ideas with us, please contact
   us.
   What is being done to protect the environment?
   Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is now underway as
   part of the overall study and planning effort. Various discipline
   studies (e.g., noise impacts, air quality impacts) will be commenced
   shortly and their results made available to the public and to
   decision-makers. Particular emphasis in the planning study is also
   being placed on urban design and land use considerations so that they
   can be clearly evaluated and understood as part of the basis for
   decisions about the final direction of the project.
   Partnership
   The Alaskan Way Viaduct project is being developed through a
   partnership between WSDOT and the City of Seattle. Both agencies have a
   stake in the outcome and have come together to coordinate efforts, make
   decisions jointly, and work with the public on transportation,
   neighborhood, and urban design issues.

   Government-to-Government Tribal Consultation Process
   Government-to-Government consultation has been initiated between FHWA
   (on behalf of WSDOT) and the Muckelshoot, Tulalip, Duwamish,
   Snoqualmie, Suquamish, and Kikiallus tribes. Coordination with the
   tribes will continue directly with WSDOT throughout project
   development.

   Financial Information
   Even prior to the stepped-up attention to the viaduct resulting from
   post-Nisqually earthquake seismic concerns, funding had been provided
   for preparation on an Environmental Impact Statement. Current thinking
   about the project is that a significantly greater funding amount must
   be provided so that in the course of the 01-03 biennium, substantial
   progress can be made on engineering and design issues. This will permit
   the project to be brought up to the point where a design-build RFP can
   be begun and, we hope, a design-build contract entered into in late
   2003. To pursue this program, WSDOT has asked the state legislature to
   make a supplemental appropriation of $35 million for the project.

   A preliminary full cost estimate has not yet been developed. This
   cannot be done until further decisions are made about the project
   concept as well as the construction delivery mechanism, the scope and
   timetable of construction, and the need for ancillary work required by
   the project (e.g., improvements to the Battery Street Tunnel or the
   City of Seattle seawall, or waterfront mitigation requirements). A plan
   of finance also must be developed that will define sources as well as
   uses of funds in the project plan. Sources likely to be considered
   include state, federal and local funds and a variety of possible toll
   or other user fee structures.
