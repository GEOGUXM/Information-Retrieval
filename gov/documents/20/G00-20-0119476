                                 Background

     At NASA we recognize that it may not be intuitively obvious what role
     a space agency can play in exploring our oceans. This web page will
                             tell you our story.
    As a technology organization utilizing the unique vantage-point from
    space, NASA Oceanography conducts a program of satellite missions and
     research projects with its partners to enable global ocean science.

                          Earth Science Enterprise

      As part of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) NASA Oceanography
    contributes to our understanding of planet Earth as a system in both
   behavior and evolution. ESE's mission is to develop an understanding of
     the total Earth system and the effects of natural and human-induced
                     changes on the global environment.

     NASA's Earth Science Enterprise

                                  Missions

      Currently NASA Oceanography conducts three primary ocean observing
     satellite missions. Through continued observation of the state and
     patterns of change in the ocean NASA contributes to innovations in
      climate prediction and weather forecasting that impacts our daily
                                   lives.

     NASA Oceanography Missions

                                  Projects

         NASA Oceanography's funded missions and research projects are
   designed to create knowledge and contribute to partnerships that enable
     global ocean science. An outcome of global oceanography is a better
      climate and weather prediction system. There are several efforts
      currently funded and many opportunities to join these efforts and
                            create new projects.

     NASA Oceanography Projects

                                Partnerships

      NASA's satellite data, research, and analysis activities provide a
      unique contribution to the goals of our partners. There are many
     national and international groups working toward the goal of global
      ocean science. Each partnership represents an important mechanism
     through which scientists around the globe use NASA's ocean data and
                       research to enhance our lives.

     NASA Oceanography Partnerships

                                  Learning

     At NASA Oceanography we are also dedicated to the support of several
   K-12 and higher education efforts. These efforts engage students of all
   ages in a better understanding of our oceans and how they have a daily
                            impact on our lives.

     NASA Oceanography Learning and Education

                                   Imaging

     Our image gallery shares some enlightening and spectacular images of
        our oceans and helps you understand the kinds of data used by
                                oceanography.
