   The thousands of acres of parkland that we developed as part of our St.
   Lawrence-Franklin D. Roosevelt Power Project have set the standard for
   hydroelectric developments across the United States.

   We've set aside almost 5,500 acres for the Thousand Island State Park
   Commission to use for various outdoor recreational areas. Whether your
   interest is camping, fishing, boating, hiking or swimming, there's
   something here for you to enjoy.

   Robert Moses State Park
   in Massena, 2,300 acres in total, is the largest site. The park
   includes the Barnhart Island Marina and Boat Basin, with slips for 66
   boats, a boat launch ramp and a place to rent rowboats, canoes and
   outboard craft. Robert Moses park has ample camping opportunities for
   tents and trailers and 15 fully outfitted cabins available for rent. A
   bathhouse with lockers is near the park's riverfront beach for swimmers
   and sunbathers. For information, call 315-769-8663.

   Coles Creek State Park
   in Waddington, built on 1,800 acres, also boasts camping, boating,
   fishing and swimming facilities. The park includes a marina with slips
   for 59 boats. Coles Creek has space for 235 campsites. For information
   or reservations, call 315-388-5636.

   The power project's boundaries include several smaller town beaches, in
   Massena, Waddington and Lisbon. Besides swimming areas, these sites
   offer playgrounds and picnic tables.

   The 3,300-acre Wilson Hill Wildlife Management Area, located on Power
   Authority land in Louisville, is a haven for migratory and native
   wildlife. The state Department of Environmental Conservation allows
   limited hunting here in the fall. For more information about permits
   and regulations, call 315-769-3396.

   Some 7,000 acres of islands scattered along the St. Lawrence River
   remain in their natural state under our jurisdiction. Visitors can
   travel by boat to fish, picnic or just enjoy the solitude of a private
   getaway.
