Technical Help

   RealPlayer
   To listen to the audio files on our site, you will need the RealPlayer
   software. To obtain the free RealPlayer 8 Basic Minimum, visit
   RealNetworks. (A deluxe version, called RealPlayer Plus, is also
   available, but the "Basic Minimum" free version is sufficient.)

   NOTE: If your connection to the Internet is via a 56k modem line, you
   should allow up to 30 minutes to download the RealPlayer software.

   RealPlayer will open in its own application window. You may continue to
   navigate the Web during the audio stream, simply by returning to your
   browser's window.

   At each meeting's end, you will be automatically disconnected from the
   live feed, and will hear a 20-second recorded message which will repeat
   for about five minutes, or until the next meeting starts.

   Let us know what you think of our audiocasts. Write to: info@mtc.ca.gov
