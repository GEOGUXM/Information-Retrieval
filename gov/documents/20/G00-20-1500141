                    The California Board of Prison Terms



             California Foreign Prisoner Treaty Transfer Program

   Authority to approve transfers of foreign-born California offenders to
   their native countries to serve the remainder of their prison terms is
   delegated to the Chairman of the Board of Prison Terms (BPT) by the
   Governor under the provisions of Government Code section 12012.1.
   California currently imprisons more than 27,000 foreign-born inmates at
   an annual cost of approximately $584 million. During the two year
   period ending December 1995, the BPT reviewed 539 applications for
   transfer, with the goal of maintaining public safety while alleviating
   prison overpopulation and saving state taxpayers the costs of
   constructing more prisons by moving substantial numbers of foreign-born
   criminals out of California prisons. Since 1994, the BPT has been
   diligently working to ensure that eligible inmates are notified of the
   program and has helped formulate federal legislation reforming
   inequities in the international transfer treaties, which would
   facilitate more transfers and a more rapid rate of processing such
   cases by the federal government. The BPT included amendments into HR
   2202 (The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act
   of 1996) signed into law by President Clinton on September 30, 1996,
   advising that future treaties eliminate any requirement of prisoner
   consent to the transfer, that a transferred prisoner serve the balance
   of the sentence imposed by the United States courts, and that the
   original prison sentence be retained so that transferred prisoners who
   return to the United States prior to the completion of the original
   sentence can be returned to custody for the balance of that sentence.
