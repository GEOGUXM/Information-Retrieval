   This composite image was created using three different instruments on
   the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The solar disk image was
   taken by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) in the Fe XV
   line at 284 Angstroms. This has an approximate temperature of 2-2.5
   million Kelvin. The sun's lower corona was imaged in the O VI line by
   the Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS). The outermost image of
   the corona, shown in white light, was taken by SOHO's Large Angle
   Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on December 23, 1996 with the C3
   coronagraph. Visible in the corona are several prominent streamers, one
   on the left (East) side of the sun and two on the right (West). The
   image shows comet SOHO-6 (C/1996 Y1) located at the bottom left of the
   sun. Also visible is the Milky Way, which stretches from the top to the
   bottom in the image.
   SOHO is a cooperative mission between the European Space Agency (ESA)
   and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). SOHO
   studies the sun from deep down in its core out to 32 solar radii. The
   spacecraft orbits the L1 Lagrangian point. From this orbit, SOHO is
   able to observe the sun 24 hours a day. It carries twelve state of the
   art instruments expected to meet the mission's three principal
   scientific objectives. These objectives are to study the solar
   interior, to study the heating mechanisms of the solar corona, and to
   investigate the solar wind and its acceleration processes.

   On this website you will find information on sungrazing comets found
   from space and from the ground. Information on the Sun and the
   International Solar-Terrestrial Physics Initiative can also be found.
   Fun pictures and educational resources that can be used both in the
   classroom and at home are shown throughout the site.
