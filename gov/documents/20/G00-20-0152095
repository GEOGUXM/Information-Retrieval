   Welcome:

      Programs in the Division of Elementary, Secondary, and Informal
      Education (ESIE) focus on diverse aspects of science, math, and
      technology education for pre-kindergarten through high school students,
      as well as learners of all ages who wish to broaden their scientific
      and technological literacy. The Division's goals are to provide vision
      and leadership for SMT education and to develop the infrastructure
      needed to strengthen science, mathematics, and technology education in
      the United States. ESIE programs foster strong collaborations among
      higher education, K-12, and informal education sectors, as well as
      among disciplinary, education, and administrative experts at all
      educational levels.
