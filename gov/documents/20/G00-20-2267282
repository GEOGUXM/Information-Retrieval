                 [sc_logo.gif] Spacecraft in Heliocentric Orbit

   Tables showing all spacecraft that have escaped the Earth/Moon system
   are available sorted by the following:
     * Spacecraft Name
     * Launch Date
     * Sponsor/Country

   Note that rocket bodies are not included, even if equiped with
   transmitters. Although it is possible that certain Apollo lunar module
   upper stages are in heliocentric orbit, they were essentially just
   being disposed of and therefore are not included in this list.

   The data (last updated 1999 March 1) used in these tables is maintained
   by Paul Chodas. Please send all comments/suggestions/corrections to
   Paul.W.Chodas@jpl.nasa.gov.
