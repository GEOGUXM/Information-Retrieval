   Most of the guides and sites listed here are written for students,
   teachers, and parents. These general, nontechnical guides give a good
   basic understanding of how the net works, the hazards of net surfing,
   and how to protect yourself from those hazards. You will find useful
   material here for the training of less technical users on how to safely
   use the Internet and to be aware of the potential hazards found there.
   You will also find material useful for any outreach programs you may
   have with local school districts.
