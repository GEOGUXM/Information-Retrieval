   PBGC Takes Over Empire Steel Pensions

   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) today announced it has
   taken over two pension plans covering more than 2,400 hourly and
   salaried employees of Empire Specialty Steel Co., a Dunkirk, N.Y.
   producer of bar, rod, wire and specialty alloys that closed in July.

   "PBGC moved to take over these plans because Empire could no longer
   fund or administer them," said PBGC Executive Director Steven A.
   Kandarian. "Because of PBGCs action, the retirement benefits earned by
   these steelworkers are secure. And those already retired will see no
   interruption in their monthly checks."

   Empire Specialty Steel was formed in 1999 from the assets of bankrupt
   AL Tech Specialty Steel Corp. Empires two pension plans have total
   assets of nearly $137 million to cover benefits totaling around $144
   million, according to PBGC estimates.

   The Empire plans were terminated as of August 31, 2001. The maximum
   pension guaranteed for workers in plans that terminate in 2001 is
   $3,392.05 a month (or $40,704.60 a year) for persons retiring at age
   65. The amounts are adjusted for retirees at other ages or those who
   elect survivor benefits. PBGC estimates that most workers will receive
   the same benefit they are entitled to receive under the plans.

   Workers and retirees do not need to take any action. Anyone with
   questions about benefits or wishing to retire may contact PBGCs
   Customer Service Center toll-free at 1-800-400-7242. For TTY/TDD users,
   call the federal relay service toll-free at 1-800-877-8339 and ask to
   be connected to 800-400-7242.

   PBGC is a federal corporation created under the Employee Retirement
   Income Security Act of 1974 to guarantee payment of basic pension
   benefits earned by more than 43 million American workers and retirees
   participating in private-sector defined benefit pension plans. PBGC
   insures nearly 38,000 pension plans. The agency receives no funds from
   general tax revenues. Operations are financed largely by insurance
   premiums paid by companies that sponsor pension plans and investment
   returns.
