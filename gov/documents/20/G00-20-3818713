   Did you know you can watch a launch from right here at Kennedy Space
   Center? If you will be in Florida during a scheduled launch, you have
   two options for launch viewing.  Due to recent world events, NASA has
   suspended the issuance of car passes for viewing from inside of the
   Kennedy Space Center. However, a limited number of Launch
   Transportation Tickets for viewing Space Shuttle and Expendable Launch
   Vehicle launches may be available through the Kennedy Space Center
   Visitor Complex. There are also many prime viewing areas outside of the
   space center.
