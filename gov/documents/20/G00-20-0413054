   Burning Plasma Experiment Requirements Dale Meade Presented to UFA
   Burning Plasma Physics Workshop University of Texas, Austin, TX
   December 11, 2000 FIRE Lighting the Way to Fusion Fusion Science
   Objectives for a Major Next Step Experiment * Explore and understand
   the physics of alpha-dominated fusion plasmas: * Energy and particle
   transport (extend confinement predictability) * Macroscopic stability (
   -limit, wall stabilization, NTMs) * Wave-particle interactions (fast
   alpha driven effects) * Plasma boundary (density limit, power and
   particle flow) * Strong coupling of previous issues due to
   self-heating(self-organization?) * Test techniques to control and
   optimize alpha-dominated plasmas. * Sustain alpha-dominated plasmas -
   high-power-density exhaust of plasma particles and energy, alpha ash
   exhaust, study effects of profile evolution due to alpha heating on
   macro stability, transport barriers and energetic particle modes. *
   Explore and understand some advanced operating modes and configurations
   that have the potential to lead to attractive fusion applications. A
   Next Step Option (NSO) Should Provide the Capability to Explore Burning
   Plasma Physics, Advanced Toroidal Physics and their Coupling.

   200 s in ITER-FEAT . The combination of JET-U, JT-60 Mod, KSTAR and
   FIRE could cover the range fromsteady-state non-burning
   advanced-tokamak modes to "quasi-equilibrium" burning plasmas in
   advanced tokamak modes. FIRE Status Physics - NSO PAC review with
   Action Plan to follow up on Recommendations * Mission endorsed
   (recommend even more excitement) * Evaluate FIRE performance on the
   basis of recent scalings e.g., ITER98(y,2) and recent results with
   enhanced regimes e.g., pellet fueling * Enhanced performance design
   point being developed with Ip ~ 7.7 MA to increase confidence of high
   gain while maintaining pulse length (~ 1.5 cr) * Potential for advanced
   tokamak modes is being developed Engineering * Pre-Conceptual Design
   Activity has addressed all subsystems. Engineering Report 2000
   completed, see http://fire.pppl.gov. CD is available on request *
   Baseline design of 10 T /20 s flat top and 12 T/12 s flat top exceeds
   original design goals of 10 T/10 s flat top. * Actively cooled W outer
   divertor and baffle with conduction cooled inner W divertor, and Be
   first wall on Cu substrate satisfy cooling requirements. * Cost
   Estimate of Baseline design gives $1.2B(FY-99$) for Green Field site
   with good possibility of < $1B(FY-99) at an existing site. Potential

   unable to address the alpha-dominated burning plasma issues for 15
   years. * Compact High-Field Tokamak Burning Plasma Experiment(s) would
   be a natural extension of the ongoing "advanced" tokamak program and
   could begin alpha- dominated experiments by ~ 10 years. * More than one
   high gain burning plasma facility is needed in the world program. * The
   information "exists now" to make a technical assessment, and decision
   on MFE burning plasma experiments for the next decade.
