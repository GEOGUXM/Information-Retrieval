   OK, you've reviewed the Knowledge section and know much more about the
   MUTCD, the Millennium Edition, and the changes contained in proposed
   amendments for the new edition. But you still have questions, or you'd
   like to know the status of a specific final rule. The Resources section
   is for you. Here you'll find FHWA representatives who are overseeing
   the revision of specific MUTCD Parts. And their email addresses. There
   are also links to other FHWA safety-related programs, to other Federal
   Agency programs, and links to other Internet resources on highway
   safety and private sector associations and other organizations
   concerned with improving safety on our Nation's highways.

   To go to a Resource topic, click on any section under that heading.
