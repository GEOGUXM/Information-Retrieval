Java

   Many of the pages I've developed or maintain are making use of Java^TM
   or JavaScript^TM ... but hopefully only where appropriate!

   Java promises a lot: platform-independence, ubiquity, etc, and, in fact
   is a lot of fun, but it is still a little rough around the edges.

   If you are interested in various Java tools and GUI widgets I've
   developed, see my Java page.

   If you are experiencing problems with any of my Applets you might want
   to check the notes I wrote about problems encountered with HotGAMS.

Computer Algebra

   Many other projects involve computer algebra wherein I find myself
   using Macsyma, Maple or Mathematica, or perhaps others.
