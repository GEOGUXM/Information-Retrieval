   Today's modern woman has a multitude of roles and responsibilities:
   caregiver, wife, mother, employee, friend, and volunteer, among others.
   Twenty-six million of these American women are living with
   disabilities, varying conditions that make these roles even more
   challenging because of physical or mental limitations. Various diseases
   and conditions produce some form of disability, and a number of them
   disproportionately affect women.

   In general, the severity of a disability is described in terms of how
   much that disability limits one's daily activities. Women are more
   likely than men to be limited in the amount or kind of major activity
   they can perform. However, disability rates for both sexes increase as
   age increases. Depending on the source, the word disability is defined
   in different ways. For this site, we use the Department of Justice
   definition of physical disability:

     (1) any physiological disorder, or condition, cosmetic
     disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the
     following body systems: neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense
     organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular,
     reproductive, digestive, genito-urinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin,
     and endocrine; or

     (2) any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental
     retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness,
     and specific learning disabilities.

   Despite the many definitions of disability, one fact remains constant:
   the number of Americans with a disability is steadily increasing. Our
   nation's citizens are living longer, and the population of older
   Americans is swelling as the baby boomers age. With these demographic
   changes comes an increased prevalence in age-related disabilities.

   Some of the challenges faced by women with disabilities include:
     * physical barriers, such as architectural barriers and lack of
       adequate transportation and support services to keep appointments,
       run errands, or receive medical care;
     * financial restraints; and
     * lack of reliable health information and services that address their
       needs.

   NWHIC has created this site - Women with DisAbilities - to help women
   overcome these and some other barriers. It puts a wealth of useful
   information together into one place for women with disabilities,
   caretakers, health professionals, and researchers.
