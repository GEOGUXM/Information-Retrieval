   connect with the office of the Federal Protective Service and the Court
   Security Office which is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

   How do I know if the courthouse is open in the event of inclement

   In the event of inclement or otherwise extreme weather conditions, the
   public is urged to call the court's Code-A-Phone line for a special
   announcement on whether the courthouse will be closed or if trials have
   been canceled for that day. A recorded message on the toll-free number
   (800) 829-0189 will be accessible from about 5:30 AM. Attorneys and
   jurors are requested to call this number before leaving their office or
   residence to attend court. It is also suggested that the public tune
   into radio and television news stations, which will also broadcast
   announcements if jury trials have been adjourned or if the courthouse
   will be closed for that day. If no announcement is made by 6:00 AM and
   there is no special message on the recording, it should be assumed that
   court will be in session and jurors are to report for jury duty as
   scheduled.
