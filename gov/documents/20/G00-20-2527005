                    Statement of Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao
                 On Historic Lows in Workplace Injury and Illness

      WASHINGTON -- U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao released the
      following statement today about the 2000 Injury and Illness data
      released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics:

      "Today's announcement is good news for both workers and those who
      employ them. Workplace injury and illness rates declined in 2000, to
      the lowest level since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began reporting
      this data in the early 1970s. This data shows that our nation's
      workplaces continue to become safer and healthier each year.

      "While the number of injuries and illness cases remained basically the
      same as reported in 1999 -- 5.7 million -- the number of hours worked
      rose by two percent, resulting in a lower injury and illness rate of
      6.1 cases per 100 workers. Injury and illness rates in more dangerous
      occupations such as construction and manufacturing also continued to
      decline.

      "We must keep improving upon this positive trend in workplace injury
      and illness rates, through proper enforcement of health and safety
      standards, as well as OSHA's model compliance assistance program."
