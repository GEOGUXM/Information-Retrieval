   Figure 1. Click on figure for larger image. A rapid sediment analyzer
     that uses a pressure transducer to monitor the settling of sediment
                                                             with time.

                                   Sediment Lab:

         This lab is equipped to determine the basic attributes of marine
        sediments. Grain size analysis equipment includes a rapid sediment
      analyzer (Fig. 1), sieves, and sieve shakers to determine distributions
      within the coarse fraction, and a Coulter Counter (Fig. 2), a constant
      temperature bath, and settling tubes to determine distributions within
      the fine fraction. Available computer software allows users to acquire,
           process, display, and archive the textural data. Camera-ready
        petrographic and binocular microscopes are available to facilitate
                              compositional analysis.

                 the methods used at the Woods Hole Field Center.
                             Sediment Grain-Size Data:

        Continental Margin Program (Hathaway Data Set)-Database of sediment
        sample information acquired along the U.W. East coast from 1962 to
        1970 by joint USGS/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
        reconnaissance effort.

        USGS East-Coast Sediment Texture Database-Database of sediment
        information generated at the Woods Hole Field Center as of 2000.
        Samples primarily from U.S. east coast.

                              X-ray Diffraction Lab:

       Although optical microscopy can be used to readily identify sand and
      course silt-sized crystalline material, X-ray powder diffraction is the
      most common technique used to study the characteristics of crystalline
       structure and to determine the mineralogy of finer grained sediments,
          especially clays (Fig. 3). As a method, X-ray diffractometry is
      attractive because of its speed and ease of performance, and because it
      requires only small amounts of material, is nondestructive, and can be
      used to perform semi-quantitative analyses of poly-mineralic mixtures.

    to analyze and identify clay minerals at the Woods Hole Field Center.
