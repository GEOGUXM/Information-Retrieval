   FAQ / Contact Us


This website is developed and maintained by the National Agricultural
Library of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We are interested in
hearing any suggestions you have for improving this site, as well as
descriptions of any other problems (typos, formatting errors, broken
links) you have seen. Please contact us at invasive@nal.usda.gov.

Although the National Invasive Species Council staff would like to
respond to information requests regarding invasive species, it is not
possible for us to respond to all such inquiries. The large numbers of
invasive species alone prevent us from maintaining detailed information
on specific species. In addition, determining the invasiveness of a
species depends on a number of local factors, including type of
habitat. Specific information may be obtained by contacting local and
state agencies, organizations, libraries, universities and colleges
(see the Agencies and Organizations list and the Frequently Asked
Questions section).
