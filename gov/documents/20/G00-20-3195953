   Outcome measures in QECC

                                 green diamond bar

     * resuspension factors,
     * intake per surface unit (surface contamination × surface area ×
       time exposed ÷ respiratory protection factor),
     * intake per airborne unit (airborne contamination × time exposed ÷
       respiratory protection factor),
     * intake per skin unit (skin contamination × area contaminated) and
     * other quantitative measures of the consequences of contamination.

   QECC also includes quantitative results of historical accidents
   involving breached and unbreached sealed sources. This work (much of
   which was funded previously by the NRC) gives distributions of:
     * time-and-proximity factors, that is, the amount of time (hours) an
       individual would have had to spend at 1 meter from the unshielded
       source to receive the dose he or she actually received in the
       accident, and
     * fractions-taken-in, that is, the fraction of the activity in the
       source that became an intake,

   from about 100 different accidents. These distributions showed little
   correlation between source activity and dose. The preliminary results
   from QECC data on contamination show similar trends. It is very likely
   that actual human experience with contamination will show that, on a
   dose or risk basis, current and proposed contamination standards are
   overly restrictive. We expect to confirm that intake is not generally
   associated with skin contamination alone.
