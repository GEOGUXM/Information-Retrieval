   WELCOME:  A MESSAGE FROM THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

   [clearpixel.gif]
   [scroll.gif] We in the Office of Inspector General take very seriously
   our responsibility to serve and help protect the American publics
   interests and investments in the Department of Commerce.  More
   specifically, our Mission is to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and
   abuse, and violations of law and to promote economy, efficiency and
   effectiveness in the operations of the Department of Commerce and its
   agency elements.  Our organizational vision, as presented in our most
   recent Strategic Plan, is to create a high-quality work environment
   that promotes excellence and confidence in the the programs and
   operations of the Department of Commerce.

   Operating under the authority of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as
   amended, the Office primarily  fulfills its responsibilities by
   conducting audits, investigations, and an array of inspections, systems
   evaluations, and other reviews.  Our basic Organization consists of the
   Office of Audits, the Office of Inspections and Program Evaluations,
   the Office of Systems Evaluations, the Office of Investigations, the
   Office of Counsel, and the Office of Compliance and Administration.

   As you visit our web site, I call to your attention our listing of what
   we consider to be the Top Ten Management Challenges of the Department
   of Commerce.  In general, we view these as the major challenges because
   of their importance to the Departments mission, or the nations
   well-being, their complexity, their sizeable expenditures, or their
   need for management improvements.  Also, by going to our E-Library, you
   can download copies of our audit and inspection reports, recent
   testimonies before the Congress, as well as highlights of our latest
   strategic plan.

   Important information concerning Freedom of Information Act requests
   can also be found on our web page.  The Home button on the menu bar
   will always take you back to this page.

   But more importantly, you, for your part, can help us combat fraud and
   abuse in the Department by contacting our [hotlinesmall.gif]   with
   information about activities that may constitute violations of federal
   laws and regulations, mismanagement and abuse of authority in the
   Department.

   Again, I welcome you to our page.  Please send questions or comments
