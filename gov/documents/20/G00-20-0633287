   Introduction

   The hard X-ray band from 10 to 100 keV is a relatively poorly explored
   region of the electromagnetic spectrum. While progress may have been
   impeded because it lies between the traditional X-ray and gamma-ray
   bands, each with its own separate community of advocates, the root
   cause is technical in nature. The background is high in this band
   because of the bright cosmic diffuse flux and until now, focusing
   optics have been ineffective above ~10 keV. However, the scientific
   opportunities in this band are great and worthy of pursuit. The
   technical barriers are falling and scientific excitement is rising. Now
   is a particularly appropriate time to propose the next step.

   As its name implies, the low energy gamma-ray or hard X-ray band is a
   transitional region between X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy. It is the
   band where thermal emission blends in with non-thermal, where
   Comptonization first becomes important and where nuclear lines first
   show up. The measurement of these transitions provides unique physical
   diagnostics of the source regions. For an instrument like InFOCmS that
   breaks through the technical barrier, the scientific potential is
   enormous. In this section, we summarize the exciting possibilities.

   In addition to the known science objectives summarized in the sections
   below, there will be many serendipitous discoveries. Whenever
   observational capabilities are improved by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude,
   as they will be with InFOCmS and satellite follow-ons, new areas of
   astrophysics will be opened that we can not even imagine.

   ^44Ti Gamma-Ray Lines From Young Supernova Remnants

   Since SN1987A the long predicted (Clayton et al. 1969) detection of
   radioactive lines from supernovae has become a reality. The most
   intense lines are expected from ^56Ni->^56Co->^56Fe (mean life 113.2
   days), followed by those from ^57Co->^57Fe (mean life 392 days) and
   ^44Ti->^44Sc->^44Ca (mean life between 78 and 96 years). The detection
   of the ^56Co and ^57Co lines from SN1987A (Matz et al. 1988; Tueller et
   al. 1990) has, for the first time, placed explosive nucleosynthesis
   theories on an observational basis. In addition, the Doppler broadening
   of the g-ray lines in the expanding nebula reflects the velocity
   distribution modified by the opacity along the line of sight. Hence,
   observations of these lines provide the most direct test of current
   models of both explosive nucleosynthesis and the dynamics of SN ejecta
   (Clayton 1974; Chan & Lingenfelter 1991; Gehrels et al. 1987;
   Ruiz-Lapuente et al. 1993). The InFOCmS experiment has been explicitly
   designed to observe the ^44Ti produced in Galactic SNe over the last
   few hundred years to make the next significant steps in this discovery
   process.

   The ^44Ti decay to ^44Sc produces lines at 67.9 keV (100%) and 78.4 keV
   (98%). Theoretical models of Type Ib and Type II Sne (Woosley & Hoffman
   1991; Thielemann et al. 1990; Hashimoto et al. 1989; Ensman & Woosley
   1988; Nomoto et al. 1984; Woosley & Weaver 1982) yield ^44Ti mass
   values of ~1.0 x 10^-4 M. The longer life of ^44Ti allows us to observe
   these lines from Galactic SNe for several hundred years after the
   explosion and discover the recent SNe in our Galaxy. Historical records
   have allowed us to identify only 2 or 3 nearby Galactic SNe within the
   past 300 years, but the estimated (van den Bergh & Tammann 1991)
   Galactic SNe rate gives an expected number of 14 Galactic supernovae in
   300 years for a Hubble constant of 75 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. The detection of
   ^44Ti decay lines could in principle allow the discovery of other
   recent optically obscured SNe.

   COMPTEL and OSSE on CGRO have detected the 1.157 MeV line from ^44Ti,
   from Cas A (Iyudin et al. 1994, Schönfelder et al. 1996, The et al.
   1995,1996). Cas A is thought to be the ~300 year old remnant of a Type
   Ib SN. Combining these measurements, the most probable ^44Ti line flux
   is 3.5 x 10^-5 photons cm^-2 s^-1. While observations with the HEXTE
   instrument on XTE has not been able to confirm these lines, its 9 keV
   resolution and systematics-limited sensitivity do not produce a clear
   conflict with the COMTEL results. In contrast, a raster scan using
   InFOCmS will be photon limited and the two lines be resolved. The
   sensitivity for each of the lines is ~2 x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1(with a
   0.5 arcmin resolution mirror and 2 keV detectors for 12 hours. It will
   be possible to crudely map the line emission in a single observation
   for the compact source at the center of the remnant predicted by the
   simplest models.

   The 100-day exposures afforded by ultra long duration balloon flights
   would provide an opportunity for very detailed study to map the three
   dimensional structure of the ^44Ti, which can be compared directly with
   that of the other ejecta. A 2-dimensional map with < 2 arcmin angular
   resolution can be constructed for each line. Information about the
   third dimension comes from a measurement of the line centroid to an
   accuracy of 100 eV for each spatial bin, and thus allow us to construct
   a Doppler map of Cas A, with velocity resolution of 400 km s^-1. A
   comparison can then be made with the results of X-ray Doppler mapping,
   which has revealed that the ejecta are confined to an inclined ring,
   with characteristic velocity of ~2,000 km s^-1 (Holt et al. 1994).

                                   Fig. 1

     Fig. 1. ASCA map of the Cas A SNR in the X-ray continuum (4-8 keV).
     This map is very similar to the radio map, suggesting a non-thermal
                                 component.

   Most recently, COMPTEL has also reported a positive detection of ^44Ti
   emission from the Vela region at the flux level of 3.8 x 10^-5 photons
   s^-1 cm^-2 (Iyudin et al. 1998). The centroid of this emission
   coincides with a newly discovered supernova remnant in X-rays
   (Aschenbach et al. 1998), which has a radius of 1 degree and an
   apparent shell expansion speed of 3000 km s^-1. Analysis of the
   observed ^44Ti flux and the X-ray properties tells us that this
   supernova occurred about 700 years ago at a distance of only 150 pc
   away (Chen & Gehrels 1999). Because of the more advanced age and
   greater angular extent than Cas A, the InFOCmS observation of this new
   ^44Ti supernova remnant, GRO J0852-4642, may offer a better opportunity
   to answer the important question of whether the ^44Ti is concentrated
   at the center of the remnant or distributed in a filled sphere.

   Of the other known Galactic supernova remnants only Tycho (1572 AD, d ~
   3.5 kpc) and Kepler (1604 AD, d ~ 4.4 kpc) are potentially detectable
   in ^44Ti lines by InFOCmS (both are below the HEXTE threshold).
   Observing these two remnants would provide important information about
   nucleosynthesis models. Tycho is the remnant of a Type Ia supernova.
   Observing the ^44Ti lines from it would allow a direct comparison of
   the ^44Ti production between carbon deflagration/detonation and core
   collapse SNe. The nature of the Kepler progenitor is a subject of
   controversy. If differences are measured in the ^44Ti yields from the
   Tycho and Cas A progenitors, then a measurement of the ^44Ti line
   strength in Kepler can resolve this controversy. If the same quantity
   of ^44Ti were produced in all three SNe, a simple scaling of the Cas A
   flux indicates an integrated flux in each line for either Tycho or
   Kepler of ~6 x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1. While the reduced instrumental
   sensitivity as a consequence of the remnants finite spatial extent (4'
   for Kepler; 8' for Tycho) would place them below the sensitivity
   threshold during a 12.5 hour exposure, their ^44Ti emission could be
   mapped during a week-long exposure from a long-duration balloon flight.
   Similarly, SN1987A, with an expected flux in each line of a few x 10^-6
   photons cm^-2 s^-1, would be ideally suited for a long InFOCmS
   exposure.

   Synchrotron Emission from Shock-Accelerated Electrons in SNR

   The discovery of synchrotron emission from shock-accelerated electrons
   in several supernova remnants via spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy
   with ASCA (SN1006 Koyama et al. 1995), IC 443 (Keohane et al. 1997),
   Cassiopeia A (Allen et al. 1997), RXJ1713.7-3946 (Koyama et al. 1997),
   and G266.3-1.2 (Aschenbach 1998) provided direct proof that the shocks
   of supernova remnants are an acceleration source for cosmic rays up to
   100 TeV. However, this still falls short of the 1000 TeV "knee" of the
   observed cosmic-ray spectrum (Axford, 1992), where the mechanism of
   cosmic-ray emission is believed to change. In the higher energy band,
   the increased sensitivity and imaging capability of InFOCmS provides an
   opportunity to probe synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated to
   energies up to 600 TeV.

   Reynolds (1998) predicted that such synchrotron emission should be
   common among young supernova remnants, however observations confirming
   this have been slow to develop because synchrotron emission at lower
   energies is blended with extremely strong thermal bremsstrahlung and
   thermal line emission from the shocked, ionized plasma. However, above
   10 keV these emission mechanisms drop off rapidly and any synchrotron
   emission emitted from the remnant will dominate.

   InFOCmS has a spatial resolution comparable to the ASCA satellite,
   therefore it will be possible to differentiate shell emission from
   plerionic emission in Galactic supernova remnants. This will provide a
   unique opportunity to search young supernova remnants dominated by
   thermal emission below 10 keV for evidence of shock-accelerated cosmic
   rays.

   Finally, sometime within the next decade, the blast wave of SN1987A
   will encounter its circumstellar shell (Luo & McCray 1991). The
   resulting young supernova remnant might be become extremely luminous,
   approaching 10^38 erg s^-1. While the primary emission bands are
   expected to be the UV and soft X-ray, it is possible that some hard
   X-ray emission will be associated with this event. The InFOCmS
   experiment will have a 20 to 40 keV luminosity threshold for SN1987A of
   5x10^35 erg s^-1, and so be able to place a very sensitive upper limit
   on the hard flux. Table 1 is a sample of young supernova remnants that
   will be observable with InFOCmS. Surface brightness values not
   referenced in this table are preliminary results from fits to GIS and
   SIS ASCA data to a model comprised of a power law and the
   non-equilibrium ionization model of Hamilton et al. (1983).

   Intergalactic Magnetic Fields

   The strength of the magnetic field in intergalactic space is one of the
   great unknowns in astronomy. Its value is unknown even to an order of
   magnitude, yet it has a profound effect on many important problems,
   including equipartition in the IGM, kinematics of AGN jets,
   intergalactic cosmic-ray propagation, and the structure and evolution
   of classical double radio sources. By observing the Compton upscattered
   cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the radio lobes at the terminus
   of AGN jets, InFOCmS can provide a new measurement that will allow the
   first direct calculation of the field strength. The radio emission from
   the lobes is produced by synchrotron radiation from jet particles
   probably electrons and positrons which are confined by the
   intergalactic magnetic field. The radio luminousity is a function of
   the particle densities and magnetic field strength and without an
   independent measurement, one can only assume equipartition to calculate
   these crucial factors. This assumption is clearly dubious for a dynamic
   system like a jet-powered radio lobe. Measurement of an independent
   parameter could enormously enhance our understanding of the AGN jets,
   the IGM, and their interaction.

                        Fig. 2. Cygnus A radio jets.

   Hard X-rays are produced when the relativistic leptons in the lobes
   Compton up-scatter the CMB photons. The Lorentz factor required to
   boost the CMB photons to the 20 to 40 keV band is g ~ (30 keV / 2.32 x
   10^-7 keV)^1/2 ~10^4, which is about the same as that required to
   produce synchrotron radiation at 100 MHz in a 1 mG magnetic field.
   Therefore, the observed GHz radio emission from jet lobes also points
   to observable hard X-rays. The inverse Compton radiation will have the
   same energy spectral index a as the synchrotron radiation does, and
   their luminosities are directly correlated via L[ic]µ (U[CMB]/U[B])
   L[syn], where U[CMB] and U[B] are the energy densities of the CMB
   radiation and IGM magnetic field. The energy density ratio reaches
   unity for B[IGM] ~3 mG. Thus, the hard X-ray luminosity from the jet
   lobes is in general of the same order as the radio luminosity.
   Quantitatively, if the synchrotron flux is in the units of mJy, the
   inverse Compton flux will be:

   F[ic] ~ 100 B[mG^-2] E[30 keV^-1] n[GHz] F[syn,mJy] mCrab

   for a = 1. Thus 100 mCrab fluxes can be expected from the lobes.

   The Compton upscattering spectrum mimics the electron spectrum that
   produces it, so there should be X-ray lobes equivalent to the hard
   X-ray lobes. Why hasnt this measurement been completed already? The
   AGN is usually a very bright X-ray point source. The galaxy is usually
   surrounded by hot gas which produces a diffuse source of thermal X-rays
   that can be confused with the upscattered spectrum from the lobes. With
   a typical temperature < 6 keV in the X-ray band, this thermal source
   has also nearly disappeared above 20 keV. The best place to look for
   inverse Compton hard X-ray emission of the radio jets is where the lobe
   is relatively far away from the core (> 1' to 2'), the lobe radio flux
   is at least a few mJy with a relatively steep spectrum (a > 0.5), and
   the X-ray and radio emission from the core is weak. Tentative
   candidates are 3C61.1 (Liang 1981), 3C236 (Strom & Willis 1986) and
   NGC6251 (Perley et al. 1984).

   Cyclotron Lines

   Electrons in the ionized plasma accreting onto the poles of a neutron
   star will undergo cyclotron motion in the strong magnetic field (~10^12
   to 10^13 G). Transitions between discrete Landau levels can occur,
   giving rise to a series of hard X-ray lines at the fundamental
   cyclotron frequency and its harmonics. The energy of the lines is a
   direct measure of the magnetic field strength, but high resolution
   observations of the line profiles (fundamental and harmonics) as a
   function of pulse phase can provide a wealth of new information on the
   spatial distribution of both the field and accretion flow (Meszaros and
   Nagel 1985; Wang et al. 1989; Mihara 1995).

              Fig. 3: Graph of GSFC/LEGS Her X-1 Cyclotron Line

     Fig. 3. GSFC high resolution balloon instrument spectrum of Her X-1
                               cyclotron line.

   Cyclotron features have been detected from the X-ray pulsars, Her X-1
   (Trumper et al. 1978; Tueller et al. 1984), 4U0115+63 (Wheaton et al.
   1979), Vela X-1 (Kendziorra et al. 1992), and GX1+4 (Maurer et al.
   1982). Recently, the Ginga satellite added X0331+53, Cep X-4,
   4U1907+09, 4U1538+52, and GX301-2 (Makishima & Mihara 1992). All of
   these sources have their fundamental or a strong first harmonic in the
   20 to 40 keV band of our instrument. The best studied of these is Her
   X-1 where the cyclotron line is pulsed with a flux ~10^-3 photons cm^-2
   s^-1 and a width of ~10 keV. The energy of the line was found to shift
   with phase of the 1.24 sec pulsation (Gruber et al. 1980). Changes in
   the absorption and scattering properties of the accretion column and
   changes in the viewing angle appear as changes in the cyclotron line
   profile. While many high sensitivity NaI and proportional counter (low
   resolution) spectra of Her X-1 exist, we cannot even say unequivocally
   whether the line is seen in absorption or emission. InFOCnS will detect
   ~1 count s^-1 on average in the 20 to 40 keV band from Her X-1 and Vela
   X-1. Thus, in a 12 hour observation, we can make a 20s measurement in
   ~100 phase bins. InFOCmS can provide the pulse-phase-resolved
   high-resolution measurements of the fundamental at 35 keV and perhaps
   the first harmonic at 70 keV to yield a clearer understanding of the
   emission region. We expect from InFOCmS and Constellation-X results to
   revolutionize our understanding of accretion on X-ray pulsars.

   Galactic Black Holes

   The dynamical evidence for accreting black holes in X-ray binaries now
   seems conclusive (Tanaka & Lewin 1995). Most of the black hole systems
   are X-ray transient systems, where the mass-donor is a late-type star.
   Accreting black holes show a distinct spectral signature of an
   ultra-soft component with a characteritic temperature of ~1 keV and/or
   an ultra-hard power law component that extends up to several hundred
   keV (e.g. Wilson and Rothschild 1983; Sunyaev et al. 1991). In
   contrast, X-ray pulsars exhibit flat power law spectra up to 10 to 20
   keV, which then decay rapidly (White et al. 1994). Low magnetic field
   neutron star systems exhibit either spectra with a characteristic
   temperature of 5 to 10 keV, or power law spectra with a photon index of
   2 to 3 (White et al. 1994). In their low luminosity state, some X-ray
   burst sources show a power law spectrum that seems to extend to high
   energies (Mitsuda et al. 1989). The photon index in these cases may be
   similar to that seen from the BHC in the high state. Sensitive
   observations of the X-ray continuum of low luminosity X-ray binaries
   above 20 keV have been difficult because of lack of sensitivity in this
   band. The InFOCmS will be able to make a sensitive search for a hard
   X-ray tail from X-ray binaries and shed important information on the
   hard X-ray properties of neutron stars and black hole candidates.

   Hard X-Ray Imaging Observations of Clusters of Galaxies

   X-ray emission from clusters of galaxies in the 0.1 to 10 keV band
   originates primarily from a hot intracluster gas with a temperature of
   1 to 10 keV, which contributes only a small fraction to the E > 20 keV
   spectrum. Hard X-ray observations in the 20 to 100 keV band have been
   performed with non-imaging large area detectors to search for a
   non-thermal component in clusters. The observational results from a
   wide variety of instruments are limited to ~1x10^-5 ph cm^-2 s^-1
   keV^-1 in the 20 to 100 keV band, ~10 X poorer than InFOCmS. The hard
   X-ray detections are interpreted as the inverse Compton (IC) scattering
   of high energy electrons (which produce the diffuse non-thermal
   synchrotron radio emission observed in clusters) off the 2.7K cosmic
   microwave background.

   Measurement of the relative intensity of the inverse Compton to
   synchrotron flux is the only direct measurement of the intracluster
   magnetic field. It is therefore believed that the hard X-ray emission
   is diffuse in nature and extended on a cluster scale. For at least one
   cluster (A2199, Kaastra et al.) the intensity of the hard component is
   so strong that it changes the temperature of the hot gas component and
   radically changes the inferred dark matter mass and the ratio of
   baryonic to dark matter. If this result is correct and applies to other
   clusters it could require a radical change in our present understanding
   of the structure and evolution of clusters.

   Recently, diffuse EUV emission has been observed by EUVE. This
   extremely soft extended component has been also interpreted as due to a
   non-thermal process owing to synchrotron emission from high energy
   electrons of 150 MeV. In these cases the cluster magnetic field has to
   be weaker and the ratio of IC to radio synchrotron component would be
   rather large.

   In addition spectro-imaging analysis of the ASCA spectra of several
   clusters (Perseus and A3266) indicates the existence of point-like
   objects in the central core region with very hard spectra (probably
   AGN) indicating that a considerable fraction of the flux seen by
   non-imaging instruments in clusters may not be diffuse.

   These tantalizing results indicate that hard X-ray imaging observations
   are critically important for our understanding of clusters, the amount
   and distribution of dark matter, strength of the magnetic field and the
   origin and distribution of relativistic particles. Moreover the imaging
   spectroscopic analysis is also useful to investigate the non-thermal
   processes.

   We expect to detect hard X-rays from both point sources and the diffuse
   component in clusters of galaxies. We select the Perseus cluster as the
   first target, in which NGC1275 is located as a point source in the
   central region slightly shifted from the cluster center.

   Active Galactic Nuclei

   It is well accepted that the various classifications of active galactic
   nuclei arise from the same physical object being viewed at different
   inclination angles (Antonucci & Miller 1985, Miller & Goodrich 1990,
   Antonucci 1993, Urry & Padovani 1995). It is believed that these
   inclination effects are primarily caused by a thick dusty torus
   surrounding the central engine of the AGN, preventing optical, UV and
   soft X-rays from being directly observed from the central engine at
   certain inclination angles.

   X-rays from a source above the AGN accretion disk can be "reflected"
   via inverse Compton scattering either from the torus or the accretion
   disk itself. This Compton reflection produces a significantly greater
   flux of hard X-rays than predicted by the intrinsic power law itself.
   This component is commonly referred to as the reflection hump (Lightman
   & White 1988, Guilbert & Rees 1988). This Compton reflection hump has
   played a significant role in detecting faint type II AGN (Pounds et al.
   1990, Piro et al. 1990, Matt 1997, Malaguti et al. 1998). Another
   signature of Compton scattering is the presence of fluorescence Ka
   lines of neutral and ionized iron (Matt et al. 1991, Ghiselli et al.
   1994, Krolik et al. 1994). However, there are still several AGN
   observations with ASCA that have observed iron fluorescence lines
   without observing a Compton reflection hump (Eracleous et al. 1996,
   Grandi et al. 1997, Yamashita & Inoue 1996, Weaver et al. 1997, Turner
   et al. 1997). Perhaps the Compton reflection continuum lies below the
   sensitivity of ASCA at these energies or there is a refinement to
   Compton reflection theory that must be made. The Compton reflection
   hump is predicted to peak within the energy range 20 to 80 keV making
   InFOCmS an ideal instrument to explore Compton reflection in AGN.

   Cosmic X-Ray Background

   It is known that the cosmic X-ray background above 0.1 keV is comprised
   of unresolved AGN (Fabian & Barcons 1992). Recent ASCA deep surveys of
   deep ROSAT fields (e.g. Georgantopoulos et al. 1997) reveal a
   population of AGN not detected in the ROSAT survey due to absorption.
   The spectral slope of faint type II AGN matches the observed spectral
   slope of the cosmic X-ray background of G=1.5 better than type I AGN
   (G=1.9, Nandra & Pounds 1994), making obscured Sy II and narrow
   emission line galaxies background source candidates. However, the
   survey has only resolved about 30% of these background sources.

   Type II AGN are believed to be the dominant source of background X-rays
   above 2 keV in the local universe, but we are currently unsure about
   their contribution at higher redshifts (Boyle et al. 1998a). There are
   very few type II AGN that have been observed at redshifts z > 0.1
   (Boyle et al. 1998b, Ohta et al. 1996). Compton reflection should
   brighten these objects in the 20 to 80 keV range and allow InFOCmS to
   play a key role in identifying high-redshift type II AGN.
