                      Print Passport Application Forms

   It is now possible to print passport application forms in Portable
   Document Format (PDF). Adobe PDF files require Acrobat Reader software
   from Adobe Systems Inc.

   The forms you print must be clear and sharp. Applications that are
   blurred or illegible will not be accepted. They must be printed in
   black print on white paper. The paper must be 8 1/2 inches by 1l
   inches, with no holes or perforations, at least medium (20 lb.) weight,
   and with a matte surface. Thermal paper, dye-sublimation paper, special
   inkjet paper, and other shiny papers are not acceptable.

   Some printers will reduce the photograph area on the passport
   application to less than 2x2 inches. Please make sure that the
   photograph area on the printed application form is 2x2 inches to ensure
   that the photographs you submit (also 2x2 inches in size) can be
   correctly attached.
