   Welcome to DPA

   Welcome to our web site. The Department of Personnel Administration
   represents the Governor as the "employer" in all matters concerning
   California State personnel employer-employee relations. As such, we are
   responsible for all issues related to collective bargaining including
   classification, pay, benefits, and training. DPA also administers the
   Savings Plus Program and the State Telework program. DPA's Legal Office
   offers a full range of legal services to agencies and departments on
   all labor relations matters and most employment and personnel matters.
   If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, please contact us.
