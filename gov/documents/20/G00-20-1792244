   [legcnslg.gif] [The Legislative Counsel ]
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Legislative Counsel was established in 1913 to assist the
   Legislature, the Governor, and other state officers by providing legal
   services relating to the legislative process. We draft legislation,
   render legal opinions, provide counsel to the Members and committees of
   the Legislature, and represent the Legislature in litigation. In
   addition, we publish the Legislative Index, which identifies
   legislative measures, and we compile and index the California statutes
   and codes. The Legislative Counsel also is responsible for the
   Legislative Data Center, which operates the legislative information
   systems and processes legislative measures.

   The Legislative Counsel is required by law to make legislative
   information available to the public on the Internet. Starting in
   January 1994, this information was accessible by way of FTP and e-mail.

   The systems and processes that make this information available on the
   Internet are based on the same automated processes that have been
   developed by the Legislative Counsel to serve the Legislature and other
   state offices and support the legislative process. You can therefore be
   assured that this information is accurate, reliable, consistent and
   timely, day in and day out, throughout each legislative session.
