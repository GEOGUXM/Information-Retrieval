                      CONSUMER TIPS: Preparing for Y2K

   In the absence of a sure-fire cure to the Year 2000 (Y2K) technology
   problem, temporary disruptions in some services are a real possibility.
   But the more you know about the Y2K problem- and the readiness of those
   on whom you depend for basic goods and services- the more you'll know
   about what you need to do. The Y2K problem, like many others we face on
   a daily basis, should be met with logic and common sense. The following
   suggestions may help you minimize any problems or inconveniences you
   might experience.

   BE AN INFORMED CITIZEN. Ask your utility companies about their Y2K
   status. Talk with local officials about what the police, fire, and
   emergency medical services have done to prepare and post their non-911
   direct dial emergency numbers. Burglar alarms connected to computer
   networks at police stations and security companies should be tested.
   Know the most direct route to the nearest hospital.

   BE AN EDUCATED CONSUMER. While many appliances do not rely on date
   sensitive technology, you should contact manufacturers to verify Y2K
   compliance. Check with your doctor, pharmacist, broker, grocer and
   others who provide you with valuable services about what they have done
   to prepare.

   PRUDENCE IN THE PANTRY. You are probably better prepared to handle any
   Y2K disruptions than you realize. What you should have on hand a
   flashlight and batteries, warm blankets, a couple of extra cans of
   food- are items you are apt to have in your home already. If you take
   medication, consult your doctor if you are concerned about any Y2K
   related shipping delays.

   KEEP TRACK OF YOUR FINANCES. The financial services industry is
   well-prepared- the bank is still the safest place to keep your money. A
   few common sense measures on your part will protect you against any
   unforseen glitches, such as billing errors. Save receipts and obtain
   paper copies of bank and loan statements and other financial
   transactions, especially deposit slips. Visit or call your local bank
   to learn about their Y2K plans. Talk to your employer about steps taken
   to address Y2K vulnerabilities in the payroll system. Take Y2K
   readiness into account when making investments.

   TRAVEL SMART. If you plan to travel, obtain written confirmation of
   your reservations directly from the provider as well as from your
   travel agent. Factor Y2K into your travel plans much as you would any
   other disruption, such as bad weather or overbooking, that would cause
   you to experience delays. If you are traveling abroad, check with the
   State Department for Y2K travel alerts.

   BEWARE OF SCAMS. Con artists are already actively exploiting people's
   Y2K fears. Be wary of goods and services touted as Y2K guaranteed.
   Beware of anyone attempting to sell you unnecessary products such as
   massive food supplies, water treatment kits or other "Y2K personal
   preparedness" items. Never give out personal financial information over
   the phone unless you initiate the call and are sure the person you call
   is legitimate. Report any attempts to solicit this information to the
   police. (More information on Y2K scams...)
