                              Mission Statement

   The Federal Malaria Vaccine Coordinating Committee (FMVCC) is an
   interagency working group composed of representatives of agencies of
   the U.S. Federal Government that have an interest in and commitment to
   the global prevention and control of malaria. Because vaccines have
   proven to be cost-effective means of disease control, representatives
   of these agencies desire to promote the development, evaluation,
   production and widespread deployment of safe and effective malaria
   vaccines, either alone or in combination with other malaria control
   measures. In recognition of the diverse activities, expertise and
   resources that such a process requires, participating representatives
   agree to facilitate all phases of the process through sharing
   information and expertise, identifying, developing, and communicating
   priorities, and collaborating actively and assisting in coordinated
   efforts with each other and other agencies.
