   The Diceman presents a provocative, uncompromising and even irreverent
    look at the world of espionage. The Diceman brings more than 30 years
     of military and government OPSEC, security and counterintelligence
   experience to the IOSS. His Defensive Information to Counter Espionage
       (DICE) briefings effectively go to the heart of the message of
     countering the threat through OPSEC and personal responsibility. He
    explains who the players are, their targets, their modus operandi and
      most importantly, how employees can protect the information they
   handle. The Diceman is a live wire, entertaining as he is informative,
    sure to keep you on the edge of your seat, and guaranteed not to put
                               you to sleep.

             Hear what a few DICE briefing attendees have said:

      "Informative, engrossing and quite entertaining." Lockheed Martin

    "As a result of the presentation, personnel are more knowledgeable of
   the threat to our Nation by foreign intelligence adversaries...and more
   aware than ever of how to neutralize the threat." Joint Chiefs of Staff

                   And from other security professionals:
             "Dice should be required for all security people."

                     "An awesome and inspiring speaker."
