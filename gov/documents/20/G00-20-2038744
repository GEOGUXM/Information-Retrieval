   01. EMPLOYMENT OF DISABLED INDIVIDUALS
    1. Is the Federal government covered by the Americans With
       Disabilities Act (ADA)?
       The ADA does not cover the executive branch of the Federal
       Government. The executive branch continues to be covered by Title V
       of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination
       in services and employment on the basis of handicap and which is a
       model for the requirements of the ADA. The ADA, however, does cover
       Congress and other entities in the legislative branch of the
       Federal Government.
    2. May an agency deny a qualified disabled individual employment
       solely because the building is not accessible by the disabled
       person?
       No. An agency cannot deny employment to a qualified disabled
       individual solely because the facilities are inaccessible.
       Appropriate building adjustments are to be made to accommodate the
       person's disabling condition.
    3. Are recreational and/or social alcohol and drug users protected
       under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended?
       No. Recreational or social users of alcohol or drugs are not
       protected under the Act. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as
       amended, protects rehabilitated alcoholics and rehabilitated drug
       abusers as well as those who are undergoing rehabilitation,
       provided that such individuals can still perform the functions of
       their job.
    4. If, for pregnancy-related reasons, an employee is unable t perform
       the functions of her job, does the employer have to provide
       reasonable accommodation?
       Yes. Pregnancy is treated as a temporary disabling condition. If
       other employees who are temporarily disabled and cannot perform the
       functions of their job are reasonably accommodated, then the same
       treatment should be accorded to pregnant employees.
    5. May pregnancy be used as a basis to refuse to hire?
       No. An employer cannot refuse to hire a woman because of her
       pregnancy-related condition so long as she can perform the
       necessary functions of the job.

   02. EEO ADVISORY COMMITTEES
    1. If an EEO Advisory Committee member is approached by a person who
       wants to present an EEO complaint matter, what then is the
       responsibility of that Committee member?
       EEO Advisory Committee members do not have the authority to handle
       EEO complaint matters. Therefore, the person who wants to present
       an EEO complaint matter should be referred to the Civil Rights
       Office, NOAA, or an agency-certified EEO Counselor for information
       and assistance.

   03. NATIONAL ORIGIN DISCRIMINATION
    1. May an office rule be established requiring employees to speak only
       English at all times?
       No. Prohibiting employees at all times, in the workplace, from
       speaking their primary language disadvantages an individuals
       employment opportunities on the basis of national origin. However,
       an office may have a rule requiring that employees speak only
       English at certain times where justified by business necessity.
    2. Do ethnic slurs constitute harassment on the basis of race and/or
       national origin?
       Yes. Ethnic slurs constitute harassment when it creates an
       offensive work environment, or interferes with an individuals work
       performance or equal employment opportunities. Harassment on the
       basis of national origin and race is in violation of Title VII of
       the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.

   04. DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT PROCESSING
    1. A NOAA employee believes that (s)he has been discriminated against
       because of race, sex, age, color, national origin, religion, mental
       or physical disability, or reprisal for previous EEO activity, and
       wants to pursue it. Whom should the employee contact?
       The employee should contact a NOAA EEO Counselor. If an EEO
       Counselor is not available, the employee should contact the NOAA
       Civil Rights Office for a referral. The EEO Counselor will try to
       informally resolve the matter. If this is not possible, counseling
       will be concluded and the Counselor will issue the Notice of Right
       to File a Discrimination complaint.
    2. May an agency EEO Counselor serve as a representative for an
       aggrieved individual at any time during the discrimination
       complaint process?
       No. Agency EEO Counselors cannot serve as personal representatives
       for aggrieved individuals whose EEO matters are against the U.S.
       Department of Commerce. However, aggrieved individuals do have the
       right to representation of their choosing at any stage in the
       complaint process. EEO Counselors and the Civil Rights Office,
       NOAA, will provide potential complainants and complainants with
       instructions on their right to designate a representative.
    3. What is the role of an EEO Investigator?
       The EEO Investigator collects information and evidence on formal
       complaints. However, the Investigator does not review the merits of
       this information. That responsibility is initially assigned to the
       NOAA Civil Rights Office for purposes of settling complaints and
       writing Proposed Dispositions. The Office of Civil Rights, U.S.
       Department of Commerce, reviews the Reports of Investigation as
       well.
    4. Do managers and supervisors automatically receive copies of Reports
       of Investigation on discrimination complaints?
       No. Managers and supervisors are not routinely provided with copies
       of Reports of Investigation. Management officials generally receive
       a complaint analysis which summarizes the major findings in the
       Report. A Report of Investigation may be forwarded to a management
       official who has the authority to review and resolve complaints.

   05. AFFIRMATIVE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS
    1. Are the Administrative Support Centers required to prepare their
       own Affirmative Employment Program Plans?
       No. The Administrative Support Centers (ASCs) are not required by
       the U.S. Department of Commerce to have their ow Affirmative
       Employment Program Plans. However, each ASC is expected to
       contribute information for inclusion in the Staff Offices Plans and
       the NOAA-wide Plans.
    2. In preparing Federal affirmative employment plans, are numerical
       objectives for increasing the representation rates of minorities
       and women the same as quotas?
       No. Numerical objectives are not the same as quotas. Quota are
       court-enforced numerical requirements which must be met at the end
       of a specified period. On the other hand, numerical objectives are
       not absolute requirements. They are devised by management only as
       targets or goals for increasing the representation rates of
       minorities and women who are under-represented in a major
       occupation or occupational category.
    3. Are agencies required to establish numerical objectives?
       No. Agencies may establish reasonable numerical objectives for an
       occupational category or major occupation when there is a
       underrepresentation of minorities and/or women. In determining
       numerical objectives, the following factors need examining: (1) the
       extent of the underrepresentation; (2) the availability of
       candidates, and 3 the number of vacancies.
    4. What is the difference between Affirmative Employment Plan and the
       Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program (FEORP) Plan?
          + Affirmative Employment Plans identify which EEO group are
            underrepresented by major occupations, occupational categories
            and grade levels.
          + FEORP Plans, on the other hand, develop specific recruitment
            strategies. These strategies are designed to increase the
            representation rates of EEO groups who are underrepresented in
            the Affirmative Employment Plans. Since FEORP is a recruitment
            program, the Personnel Programs and Organizational Analysis
            Division, Human Resources Management Office, Office of Finance
            and Administration, has the responsibility for its
            development. The Personnel Operations Division, Office of
            Human Resources Management of Office of Finance and
            Administration, has responsibility for implementing FEORP.
