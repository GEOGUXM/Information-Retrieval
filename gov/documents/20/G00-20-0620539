   Description of research projects:

   A major area of research involves the identification of stress-related
   proteins and genes in fruit trees with the aim of understanding their
   function and how they may be manipulated to enhance stress tolerance.
   Another major area of research involves the use of infrared
   thermography to study ice nucleation and propagation in plants. The aim
   of this research is to develop new and effective methods of frost
   protection in fruit crops.
   A third area of research centers on the development of titleernatives
   to synthetic chemicals for the control of postharvest and other
   diseases of fruits. This involves studying the mode of action of
   microbial antagonists in order to enhance their performance.
   Combinations of physical and biological approaches are developed in
   order to prevent disease and enhance disease resistance in fruit crops.
