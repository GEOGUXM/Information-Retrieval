   Orientation (NESDIS) Orientation Overview of NESDIS NESDIS NESDIS
   MISSION: The NOAA NESDIS mission is to provide and ensure timely access
   to global environmental data from satellites and other sources to
   promote, protect, and enhance the Nation's economy, security,
   environment, and quality of life. To fulfill its responsibilities
   NESDIS acquires and manages the Nation's operational environmental
   satellites, provides data and information services, and conducts
   related research. National Environmental Satellite, Data, and
