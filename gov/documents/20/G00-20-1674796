         Objective:
   The objective of NLM's Indexing Initiative (II) is to investigate
   methods whereby automated indexing methods partially or completely
   substitute for current indexing practices. The project will be
   considered a success if methods can be designed and implemented that
   result in retrieval performance that is equal to or better than the
   retrieval performance of systems based principally on humanly assigned
   index terms.

   Background:
   For more than 150 years, the National Library of Medicine has provided
   access to biomedical journal literature through the analytical efforts
   of human indexers. Since 1966, access has been provided in the form of
   electronically searchable document surrogates consisting of
   bibliographic citations, descriptors assigned by indexers from the MeSH
   controlled vocabulary and, since 1974, author abstracts of many, but
   not all, items. The objective of the Indexing Initiative project work
   is to investigate methods whereby automated indexing methods partially
   or completely substitute for current indexing practices. The project
   will be considered a success if methods can be designed and implemented
   that result in retrieval performance that is equal to or better than
   retrieval of citations based on humanly assigned index terms.
   A project of this scope necessarily involves the efforts of many
   people. Project team members are from several NLM divisions, including
   the LHNCBC, LO, and NCBI.
   The project will assume the availability of free text in the form of
   titles and abstracts but will also consider the increasing availability
   of the full text of journal articles in electronic form. The project
   will investigate concept-based indexing methods that go well beyond
   automatic word-based indexing (such as the inverted word index already
   part of MEDLINE). As insights are gained throughout the project,
   current operational processes or systems may be iteratively modified
   and improved in keeping with those insights.
