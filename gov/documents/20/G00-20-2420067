   We are not able show you the page you have requested. You may have
   received this message because:
     * You attempted to access one of our Internet services that requires
       protection of your privacy. To protect your data, SSA is using
       strong (128-bit) encryption, but your browser software doesn't
       currently support strong encryption; or
     * You tried to access a file or a directory that is used only for
       administrative purposes.

   What Do I Need to Do?

   If your browser doesn't support strong encryption, you must upgrade
   your browser software (usually Microsoft or Netscape) to a more secure
   version. You can use the following addresses to upgrade your browser
   (both upgrades are free):

     * Microsoft Internet Explorer -
       http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.asp
     * Netscape - http://home.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html

   Once you've completed this upgrade, come back and complete your online
   transaction.

Why is Social Security Requiring Stronger Security for Its Online Services?

   Because some of our online services involve using your personal
   information, the Social Security Administration (SSA) is taking all
   reasonable and appropriate measures, including encryption, to ensure
   that your personal information is disclosed only to you. Encryption
   means that all information relating to you and your account is
   scrambled and locked with a mathematical key during the electronic
   transfer. There are two different types of encryption: 40-bit and
   128-bit. The difference between these two types of encryption is the
   degree of protection offered.

   To protect you, Social Security requires the increased security that
   128-bit encryption provides. We invite you to review Social Security's
   Internet Privacy Policy.
