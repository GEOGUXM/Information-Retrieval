Welcome to Report Coordination
               __________________________________________________________________

Report Coordination assigns publication numbers and provides quality
assurance for scientific, technical, and administrative documents
published at LBNL. All of these documents come to us before they are
printed and distributed outside LBNL. Our role is to confirm that
documents comply with LBNL and DOE policies. When a document master is
ready, we'll send it to printing and make the required DOE/LBNL
distribution. We keep track of the holders of controlled documents and
make certain that they receive all updates and revisions.
Our online Reports Catalog contains information about published
laboratory documents. You can search for any LBNL document published
since 1989 by report number, author, title word, or division. Most of
our services are described in detail on the web page "Publishing at
Berkeley Lab."
