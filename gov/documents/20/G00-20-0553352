   . Otherwise, every license now in effect (other than temporary retail
   permits and special daily licenses) is renewable unless such license
   has been revoked after hearing on an accusation. (Section 24048)

   Q. 14. When must licenses be renewed?

   A. It is the responsibility of the licensee to renew his license
   whether or not he has received a renewal notice from ABC.
   All licenses may be renewed by paying the required renewal fee before
   the license expires.
   Following the expiration of a license, the licensee may legally operate
   for an additional 60 days during which time the license may be renewed
   by paying the renewal fee and a 50% penalty. If the renewal fee and
   penalty fee has not been paid within 60 days of the expiration of a
   license, the license is canceled and the licensee may not exercise any
   privileges of the license. The licensee does have and additional 30
   days in which to reactivate the license by paying the renewal fee and a
   100% penalty. If the penalty and renewal fee are not paid by the end of
   the 30th day following cancellation, the license is revoked. (Section
   24048)

   Q. 15. How soon does the license have to be put in use?

   A. Any license must be in use within 30 days of the date of issuance,
   unless approval is received from ABC for premises under construction.
   (Section 24040)

   Q. 16. May temporary licenses be obtained for picnics and social
   events?

   A. ABC may issue a special daily license at $15 per day for either beer
   or wine, or at $30 per day for both, to a group conducting a picnic,
   social, or similar gathering, or a daily on-sale general license
   authorizing the sale of distilled spirits, wine and beer for $25 per
   day to qualified non-profit organizations. (Sections 24045 and 24045.1
   and Rules 59 and 59.5)

   Q. 17. Where may alcoholic beverages be stored when there is no room
   for them on the licensed premises?

   A. Tax-paid beer and wine may be stored anywhere. Distilled spirits may
   be stored in a licensed public warehouse, or petition may be made to
   ABC for approval of a private warehouse. this private warehouse must be
   located in the same county as the licensed premises. ABC's approval is
   necesary before placing the distilled spirits in storage in a private
   warehouse. (Section 23106 and Rule 76)

   Q. 18. How many feet must licensed premises be from a church, a school,
   or residences?

   A. The law says ABC may deny any retail license located (a) within the
   immediate vicinity of churches and hospitals, or (b) within at least
   600 feet of schools, public playgrounds and nonprofit youth facilities.
   Generally, ABC will deny a license in the above situations when there
   is evidence that normal operation of the licensed premises will be
   contrary to public welfare and morals. Mere proximity by itself is not
   sufficient to deny the license.
   ABC will not license a new retail location within 100 feet of a
   residence unless the applicant can estblish that the operation of the
   proposed premises will not interfere with the quite enjoyment of the
   property by residents. (Section 23789 and Rule 61.4)

   Q. 19. May certain conditions be placed upon the exercise of a license?

   A. Yes. ABC, at the request of the applicant or licensee, may restrict
   the hours of sale, advertising, entertainment, or any condition that
   appears to alleviate objections to the premises operation. Such
   conditions have been imposed restricting licensed operations in the
   vicinity of churches, schools, and residential areas. Also, conditions
   relating to the personal qualifications of the applicant or licensee
   may be endorsed upon the license. (Sections 23800-23805 and Rules
   61.3-61.4)
   A licensee may petition for the removal or modification of a condition.
   The fee for the petition is $100. By law, ABC must notify the local
   governing body of any petition to remove or modify conditions. the
   local governing body has 30 days in which to object to the modification
   or removal. A hearing is then held if the local government objects.
   When conditions have been imposed on a license, where otherwise the
   licnse would be denied, for reasons relating to the premises, no
   petition for removal of the conditions may be filed within one year
   from the date the license was issued, or from the date a similar
   petition was denied. However, ABC may, at its discretion, accept a
   petition to remove conditions, if the reasons which caused the
   imposition of conditions no longer exists. (Section 23803 and Rule 66)

   A. Since 1939 the number of certain retail licenses has been limited.
   At present, the ratio is one on-sale general license for each 2,000
   persons in the county in which the premises are situated and one
   off-sale general license for each 2,500 persons.

   Q. 21. Is there a limit on the number of off-sale beer and wine
   licenses that may be issued in cities or counties?

   A. The number of off-sale beer and wine licenses is limited to one for
   each 2,500 people in a city or county, and the number of beer and wine
   licenses that can be issued in a city or county in combination with
   off-sale general licenses in limited to one for each 1,250 people.
