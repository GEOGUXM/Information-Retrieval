Fastest Open Computing Platform in the World Goes on-line at Los Alamos with
1 Trillion Calculations per Second Capability

   May 17, 1999

   Los Alamos, NM.  The U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Computing
   Laboratory (ACL) at Los Alamos National Laboratory today ( May 17 )
   announced that it has accepted an SGI Origin 2000 parallel computer
   with a peak speed of 1 Trillion Calculations per second as the center's
   principal supercomputer. This system, called the ACL Nirvana Machine,
   is the fastest open computer in the world.

   The SGI system was chosen based on its ability to efficiently execute
   large-scale simulations in a capability mode which entails utilizing
   all processors towards a single problem. As part of the systems
   acceptance test, it ran a series of applications suites including a 48
   hour accelerator simulation across all 2,048 processors. The ACL
   Nirvana Machine provides three times the total computational power of
   the ACL and will be focused upon executing runs that utilize the entire
   system including simulations in support of global climate modeling,
   advanced accelerator designs, fusion plasma turbulence, high-energy
   physics, wildfire dynamics, and combustion processes.

   "We are familiar with theoretical and experimental sciences. Now, we
   are building a third branch of scientific inquiry simulation science:
   using the computer to probe nature at a resolution never before thought
   possible." Said John Reynders, Director of the ACL. "Simulations based
   on the full capability of parallel computers running trillions of
   operations per second and beyond will be the tools our scientists will
   use to unlock the next millennium of physics mysteries." The Nirvana
   machine will allow ACL users to increase the size of their computations
   to qualitatively distinct simulation regimes. For example, an
   accelerator code on the Nirvana machine simulated the halo effect in a
   proton beam using 2 billion particles - the actual number of protons in
   the beam pulse. This resolution unfolds a new fidelity of understanding
   beyond previous approaches giving accelerator physicists tools to probe
   nature with a minimal amount of approximation.

   The ACL Nirvana Machine also has 10 SGI Infinite Reality graphics
   engines attached directly to the supercomputer, providing an aggregate
   scientific visualization capability that is the largest in the world
   capable of interactive visualization and analysis of physics
   simulations with over 600 million zones.

   The ACL Nirvana Machine consists of 16 SGI Origin 2000s each with 128
   250MHz R10K processors and 32GBytes of memory. The system interconnect
   is based on the HiPPI-800 standard and is currently being upgraded to
   HiPPI 6400/GSN technology which will result in a bisection bandwidth of
   25.6Gbytes per second bi-directional. Currently, the ACL Nirvana
   Machine contains 6,912 Gbytes of disk storage for scientific data and
   over the next few months will be reconfigured into a single cluster
   wide global filesystem with a peak aggregate bandwidth of 4.8Gbytes per
   second. A separate high-speed file system of 2.592 Gbytes is attached
   to the machine in support of high-performance visualization.

   While the theoretical peak performance of supercomputers can be
   impressive, it is important to deploy a balanced system of application
   development and execution environments. To ease the transition of
   developing large-scale applications on parallel platforms, the ACL has
   produced several parallel simulation packages, libraries, and
   frameworks for scientists to develop high-performance parallel
   simulations. Scientists who are new to parallel programming are able to
   use these software systems with little or no understanding of parallel
   architectures and run-time systems. With these software systems, some
   scientists have been able to develop scalable parallel applications on
   the ACL Nirvana Machine in a matter of weeks rather than months. Once a
   scientist has developed an application and completed a simulation, the
   tools to move, store, see, and understand the data become the limiting
   factors to scientific insight. The ACL Nirvana Machine, building upon
   years of capability computer experience at the ACL, is integrated into
   a system fabric which provides the scientist a balanced architecture of
   peak speed, memory access, interconnect, parallel I/O, networking,
   tertiary store, and high-performance visualization. By providing a
   balanced infrastructure of hardware, software, and visualization the
   ACL is able to deploy the Nirvana Machine to a broad range of
   scientists and accelerate the pace of large-scale simulations in
   support of DOE programs.

   The ACL provides a balanced system of high-performance capability
   computing to about 750 researchers at national laboratories,
   universities, and industries across the nation who are working on a
   variety of Department of Energy-funded programs. Collaborating with
   other national efforts, the ACL will house an Advanced Strategic
   Computing Initiative ( ASCI ) Computer Science Institute to explore the
   challenges of computing on platforms 100 to 1,000 times larger than the
   Nirvana Machine. The ACL was also recently invited to become a partner
   of the National Science Foundations Alliance program, headed by Larry
   Smarr at the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA). In
   this role, the ACL will collaborate with the NSF community to research
   the challenges of scalable operating and run-time systems for
   high-performance capability computing.

   John Reynders adds "The acceptance of the ACL Nirvana Machine not only
   brings our scientists into a new realm of capability computing, it
   represents the deployment of a national asset which benefits and
   engages multiple communities in exploring the challenges of TeraScale
   computing." The ACL conducts unclassified research and is managed by
   the University of California for the Department of Energy through Los
   Alamos National Laboratory.
