US 395, North Spokane Corridor

     Construction Update:
     On August 22, 2001, construction began on the first NSC project, a
     grading and drainage contract, from the vicinity of Parksmith Drive to
     US 2.


      Project Facts
       __________________________________________________________________

     

       The NSC project team was recognized by the Hillyard/Whitman
       Neighborhood Council for listening to and addressing the concerns of
       the neighborhood during the design process.
     

       The corridor includes the construction of over 10 miles of
       pedestrian/bicycle trails, which link strategically located park and
       ride lots along the route and interfaces with the Centennial Trail at
       the Spokane River.
     

       When complete, the corridor can carry over 150,000 vehicles per day.
     

       Enough room is reserved in the median to accommodate light rail or
       other high capacity transit in the future.

   WSDOT's goal is to continue design and right-of-way acquisition for the
   project, commencing construction on selected project components as
   quickly as funding becomes available. The first construction work on a
   very limited portion of the project began in August, 2001.
   Why is WSDOT building the North Spokane Corridor?
   This project addresses the need for a major improvement to allow
   motorists and freight to move through metropolitan Spokane along the
   corridor from I-90 to US 395 at Wandermere. The needs of the corridor
   are indicated by increasing congestion and other operational and safety
   issues on the existing street network. The project will provide a
   facility for balanced transportation uses, incorporating high occupancy
   vehicle lanes and park and ride lots to support transit and vanpooling
   operations, as well as an expanded and enhanced pedestrian/bicycle
   facility. Right of way will also be reserved for possible light rail
   use.
   The end result
   When completed, the North Spokane Corridor will be a 60-mile per hour,
   limited access highway with a direct connection to I-90 just west of
   the Thor/Freya Interchange. Other interchanges will be placed at
   locations such as Trent Avenue (SR 290), Wellesley Avenue, Francis /
   Freya Street, Parksmith Drive, US 2, and US 395 at Wandermere. This
   project will be developed in two major phases: Phase 1 - Spokane River
   North to establish the corridor from the River to US 395 at Wandermere.
   Phase 2- Spokane River South to extend the corridor between I-90 and
   the Spokane River. Phase 2 will also include a Collector/Distributor
   (C/D) system (of up to six lanes) along I-90 between the Liberty Park
   and Sprague Avenue Interchanges.
   What are the project timelines?

   Phase 1 – Spokane River North
     * In April 1997 the Final Environmental Impact Statement, six years
       in preparation, was completed by WSDOT and approved by the Federal
       Highway Administration (FHWA).
     * Summer 2000, approval of the Limited Access and Right-of-Way Plans
       and also approval by FHWA of a Supplemental Environmental Impact
       Statement.
     * On August 22, 2001, construction began on the first construction
       element, a grading and drainage contract, from the vicinity of
       Parksmith Drive to US 2.

   Phase 2– Spokane River South
     * Review of the Environmental Impact Statement for this phase is
       currently underway.
     * Preliminary design and development of the Limited Access and
       Right-of-Way Plans is currently underway.
     * We anticipate a Design Access Hearing in the winter of 2002/2003.

   How can I get involved?
   Numerous public meetings, open houses, and formal hearings regarding
   this project have been held over the past 10 years. Additional
   neighborhood meetings, presentations, and open houses continue to be
   held on a regular basis. Interested citizens should contact the project
   engineer's office listed below or WSDOT Eastern Region Public Affairs
   at (509) 324-6015.

   What is being done to protect the environment?
   The project has undergone extensive environmental review, including
   preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement and a Supplemental
   Environmental Impact Statement for Phase 1, available for review.

   This document addresses the changes that have occurred since the
   publication FEIS, in April 1997.  The impacts resulting from those
   changes include impacts to housing, noise, air quality, hazardous
   waste, waterways, and other environmental categories that were affected
   as a result of route refinements.  As preliminary designs are refined,
   any new environmental issues will be evaluated and appropriate
   mitigation developed.

   Increasing safety is one of our priorities
   Historically, arterials such as Division Street have had accident rates
   of up to 3½ times that of a facility similar to the proposed North
   Spokane Corridor. As traffic continues to increase in neighborhoods and
   school zones, there is an increasing potential for accidents involving
   pedestrians and bicyclists. Upon the completion of the NSC, it has been
   estimated there will be a reduction of over 700 accidents per year.
   This reduction translates into a societal cost savings of over $22
   million per year. Additional information...

   Government-to-government tribal consultation process
   The WSDOT has worked closely with area Tribal officials to identify and
   avoid culturally sensitive areas within the corridor.

   Financial Information
   Prior to 2001-2003, a total of $22.6 million was allocated to this
   project for the Environmental Impact Statement, design work and limited
   right-of-way acquisitions.  Approximately $22 million has been
   allocated under the 2001-2003 Current Law Budget.  The total project
   cost is estimated at $1.36 billion.  At this time, additional funding
   amounting to $1.32 billion is necessary to support the current WSDOT
   schedule of completion.  If funding does not become available,
   adjustment of the design, right-of-way and construction schedules will
   be required and cost impacts will have to be taken into account.
