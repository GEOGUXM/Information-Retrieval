APPEALS DIVISION APPEAL HEARING PROCEDURES

  GENERAL INFORMATION

    This information is intended to assist you in preparing for your
    administrative hearing before the State Personnel Board (SPB or Board) and
    is not a substitute for having an attorney or representative. The
    information provides general answers to the most frequently asked questions
    from appellants and their representatives, and is not intended as legal
    advice. We hope that this informtion will help you to better understand the
    appeals process and prepare for your hearing.

     It is very important for you to carefully read all documents given
     to you by the department that took the action you are appealing.
     Those documents provide information about the issues involved or the
     charges brought against you by the department, what deadlines you
     must meet, what appeal and/or hearing rights you have, and when
     these must be exercised.

     You must file a timely appeal to have a hearing. The time frames
     vary based on the appeal. You must check the applicable law or rule.
     The SPB laws and administrative regulations (rules) govern the
     specific requirements, such as time frames for filing appeals within
     the Board's jurisdiction. Copies of the SPB laws and rules are
     available for review in departmental personnel offices, union
     offices, and the SPB. Government Code Sections 11513, 18500 - 19799
     and Title 2, California Code of Regulations, Sections 1 - 599.995
     and 17010 - 17592 set forth the procedures for most SPB Hearings.
     Other statutes include Government Code Sections 19800 - 10 and
     Education Code Sections 89535-42.

                       MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

     What will My Hearing be Like?

     Your hearing will be very similar to a trial in court, with
     witnesses, exhibits and rules of evidence. An Administrative Law
     Judge (ALJ) will preside at the hearing. The ALJ is not employed by
     the department bringing this action, but by the SPB. An attorney may
     or may not represent the department. You may choose to be
     represented by an attorney or other representative, or you can
     represent yourself at your appeal hearing.

     All hearings are tape recorded. A Party may request a court
     reporter, but must pay all fees. All arrangements for court
     reporters must be made through the Appeals Division two weeks prior
     to the scheduled hearing date. All requests for transcripts are
     processed by the SPB Appeals Division. Transcripts of hearings may
     also be provided, but the requesting party must pay the required
     fees.

     When the hearing begins, each side may present an opening statement.
     This tells the ALJ what each side intends to prove. Each side then
     offers relevant evidence to prove its case. Evidence can be sworn
     testimony taken under oath at the hearing, or certain kinds of
     documents, such as business records. You must prove the accuracy of
     documents you submit.

     The Department usually presents its evidence first. The department
     attorney/representative will ask questions on direct examination of
     its witnesses. When the department is finished, it is your turn to
     ask questions of the witnesses on cross-examination. The department
     attorney will have a second chance to ask questions on matters you
     brought up on redirect examination. Then you have a second chance to
     inquire on recross-examination.

     The appellant presents evidence after the department has presented
     its case. As you finish with each of your witnesses, and your own
     testimony, the department will have an opportunity to cross-examine
     each of your witnesses. You have a second chance to ask questions of
     each witness.

     The department may call rebuttal witnesses after you have presented
     your case. Rebuttal witnesses may only testify about issues brought
     up in your case. If the department calls rebuttal witnesses, you may
     be allowed to call additional witnesses to address the issues
     discussed by rebuttal witnesses.

     Before the hearing closes, you must submit all evidence to the ALJ
     to consider.

     Closing arguments may be presented by each side after all evidence
     has been received. The department usually goes first. The party that
     goes first also has the opportunity to make the last comment.
     Closing arguments address only those facts brought out in testimony
     of witnesses or documents recieved into evidence. In some cases, the
     ALJ may want the parties to submit written instead of oral argument.

  Do I have to Prove My Innocence?

     The burden of proof in state civil service, county, and California
     State University (CSU) disciplinary cases, and state and county
     medical actions, is on the employer to prove the charges.

     In state civil service rejections on probation, discrimination
     complaints, nonpunitive terminations and reasonable accommodation
     cases; Department of Personnel Administration (DPB) appeals; CSU
     petitions to set aside resignations and appeals from automatic
     resignations; layoff and refusal to hire from employment lists, the
     burden of proof is on you to disprove the stated causes (which may
     be presumed true), and to prove your claims.

     All issues raised by the action and appeal will be considered during
     the hearing. Even when the department has the burden of proof, you
     should prepare to offer evidence of your good conduct,
     rehabilitation, and evidence refuting the charges, as appropriate.
     If you believe the action was based on discrimination, you must
     present evidence during your hearing.

  Can I See the Department's Evidence Against Me?

     When you receive the Notice of Adverse Action, Rejection or other
     charging document setting forth the issues, you are entitled to
     receive all documents related to the specific acts and omissions set
     forth in the notice.

     If you do not receive this information from the department, simply
     send your request to the department attorney. You may also call or
     write the department attorney and ask to inspect relevant evidence
     the department has regarding your case. You are responsible for the
     cost for copies. You also have a right to interview employees having
     knowledge of the charges.

  What Kind of Evidence Will I need to Bring to the Hearing?

     Depending on your case, you may want to bring witnesses who know
     about the issues involved in the charges against you. If there are
     documents, such as contracts, business records, or checks that help
     prove your side, try to bring the original and three copies. You may
     bring photographs or other items that are relevant to your defense.
     Items you want to be considered must be left with the ALJ.

  Is There a Way to Settle Without a Hearing?

     Cases often settle without going to hearing. Contact the department
     attorney to see if you can work something out. You may also contact
     the SPB Appeals Division for possible assistance.

     You will receive a notice to attend a settlement conference, if
     scheduled in your case.

  How do I Get Subpoenas?

     If you are a party to a hearing, you have the right to subpoena
     witnesses and relevant documents to be produced at the hearing.
     Contact the SPB Appeals Division well ahead of the hearing for
     subpoenas duces tecum for documents and subpoenas to compel the
     attendance of witnesses with relevant testimony. You must arrange to
     pay required fees and have someone else serve the subpoenas. It is
     your responsibility to determine how to serve subpoenas correctly.

  If a Subpoenaed Witness Requests to be Paid, Who is Responsible for Paying
  Witness Fees?

    It is the responsibility of the party who subpoenas the witness to pay all
    required fees. Witnesses at a hearing are entitled to the same fees as
    allowed witnesses in civil cases in courts. In addition, witnesses may be
    entitled to mileage reimbursement. The party serving the subpoena is
    responsible to determine the witness fees and mileage to be paid in
    accordance with law.

  Is it Okay to Bring Letters Instead of Witnesses?

     Some letters may be admitted into evidence for limited purposes, but
     generally it is better to bring witnesses who can help present your
     side of the case and answer any questions raised. The ALJ will not
     speak with witnesses, except at the hearing.

     This hearing is your opportunity to tell the ALJ your side. It is
     important to have your witnesses present at the hearing to testify.

  If I Forget Something, Can I Send it to the Judge at a Later Time?

     Your chance to present evidence is at the hearing. Only in rare
     cases will the ALJ allow you to submit evidence later.

  What if I Can't be There on the Hearing Day?

     You must show good cause to change a hearing date. If you cannot
     attend on the date and the time shown on your hearing notice, you
     must contact the SPB Appeals Division as soon as you know of the
     problem. You must also contact the department representative to see
     if he/she will agree to the change. To request a different hearing
     date, you may have to file a written declaration stating the reasons
     for the change.

  What if I Don't Attend the Hearing?

     If you file an appeal and do not attend the hearing, the appeal will
     be considered withdrawn and the action final.

  What if I Need an Interpreter?

     If you or a witness require a sign language interpreter, you must
     immediately contact the department attorney or the SPB Appeals
     Division so that a certified interpreter can be provided. A friend
     or relative cannot interpret for you.

  Will the Hearing Location be Accessible to People with Disabilities?

     Hearing locations will be accessible to persons with disabilities.
     If you or your witnesses have special needs that require reasonable
     accommodation, please contact the SPB Appeals Division to verify the
     type of accommodation required, so that appropriate arrangements can
     be made.

  Who do I Contact if I Have Questions Regarding my Appeal?

     For appeals filed directly with the SPB, you should contact the
     Appeals Division to determine the status of your appeal. For DPA
     Appeals, you must contact DPA Legal Office directly, unless you have
     received correspondence that your appeal has been forwarded to the
     SPB for an evidentiary hearing.

     All correspondence received from the SPB Appeals Division will
     include the case number assigned to your appeal. Please have your
     case number available when you contact the Appeals Division
     regarding your appeal.

     The SPB Appeals Division should be contacted if you have questions
     regarding the processing of your appeal. The telephone numbers are
