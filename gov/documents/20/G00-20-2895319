                          The Vital Issues Process

                       Vital Issues Process Highlight

   The Vital Issues process is a strategic planning tool developed by
   Sandia National Laboratories that is being used to develop decision
   support systems, policy portfolios, and investment portfolios for
   managing critical infrastructures in the global arena that impact a
   system either positively (e.g., maximize energy and water resources) or
   negatively (increase threat of disease, drugs, greenhouse gas). When
   used to develop a decision support system, the Vital Issues process can
   provide an explicit and accountable means for identifying and
   prioritizing issues considered vital to the appropriate management of
   critical infrastructures and for identifying the information needed to
   properly address those issues. The Vital Issues can also be used to
   develop portfolios of appropriate policy options and to allocate
   critical resources.

High Level of Stakeholder Involvement

   The Vital Issues process affords a high level of key stakeholder
   involvement and provides a means for incorporating stakeholder input
   into management decision making. Stakeholders meet in day-long panel
   meetings to elicit a broad range of perspectives on a particular topic
   in a nonconfrontational manner and to facilitate the interaction and
   synthesis of diverse viewpoints.

A Combination of Facilitated Qualitative Group Discussion and Quantitative
Ranking

   The Vital Issues process is unique in its incorporation of two
   approaches in each panel meeting: a qualitative segment, which entails
   the synthesis of the alternatives through negotiations or discussion,
   and a quantitative segment, an analytical approach that involves
   prioritization of the alternatives using pairwise comparisons (see
   Figure 1). This combination of facilitated group discussion and
   quantitative ranking provides input to strategic management decisions
   in the form of stakeholder-defined and -prioritized items as well as
   information on potential barriers to the implementation of policies and
   programs.

Goal Setting and Identification and Prioritization of
Issues Vital to The Management of Critical Infrastructures

   An initial panel clarifies the panel topic, defines a goal statement,
   and identifies, defines, and ranks criteria used by a subsequent panel
   or panels. Depending on the application, the products of the Vital
   Issues process range from 1) selection and ranking of the issues
   considered vital to the management of the infrastructure, 2) selection
   of the items in a policy portfolio, 3) identification of information
   needed to address the vital issues, or 4) ranking the programs in an
   investment portfolio.

Panel Meeting Format

   Each day-long meeting begins with discussion and clarification of the
   panel topic. This discussion continues until panelists reach consensus
   on a working definition of the topic and other key terms. The
   panelists, in the case of the initial panel, then brainstorm to select
   and define the criteria. In the case of subsequent panels, the
   panelists define the vital issues, portfolio items, or information
   needs, depending on the application. After selecting the items, the
   panelists champion and rank each item (criteria, vital issue, or
   portfolio item) using pairwise comparisons in a three-step process
   known as point-counterpoint-score. During this process, one panelist
   champions the item in the context of the selected criterion or
   criteria, another panelist provides counterpoint or rebuttal of the
   champion's presentation, and the item is then scored against all others
   previously presented (see Figure 2). The results provide a
   group-averaged relative ranking of the items.

   The number and types of panels convened depend on whether the objective
   is to develop a decision support system, a policy portfolio, or an
   investment portfolio.

Decision Support System

   When using the Vital Issues process to develop input to a decision
   support system, three vital issues panel (VIP) meetings are held (see
   Figure 3):
    1. The initial panel (VIP I) develops a goal statement and criteria to
       be used by the second panel to identify and rank the issues
       considered vital to the management of the infrastructure under
       consideration. The results of the pairwise comparison performed on
       the criteria are used to calculate panel-averaged relative values
       and criteria weights.
    2. The second panel (VIP II) uses the goal statement and criteria
       generated by the first Vital Issues panel to select and rank the
       vital issues. The results of the pairwise comparison performed on
       the vital issues are used to calculate panel-averaged
       criteria-weighted relative values of the vital issues. In addition
       to group-average related ranking of the vital issues, the process
       also provides a quantitative measure of the level of agreement
       among stakeholders.
    3. The third panel (VIP III) identifies a preliminary list of
       information the decision makers would need to address each of the
       vital issues. The information needs identified at the third Vital
       Issues panel meeting can then be incorporated into the decision
       support system to ensure that the system is responsive to the
       issues considered vital to the management of the particular
       infrastructure under consideration.

Policy Portfolio

   In the policy portfolio case, four panels or sets of panels are
   required (see Figure 4). The initial panel defines the overall
   objective and criteria for ranking the issues. The second panel selects
   and ranks the vital issues (Stage I). After an independent analysis of
   the existing strategies, a set of panels, one for each vital issue,
   identifies response strategies or policy options for addressing each
   issue (Stage II). A fourth panel refines a composite list of strategies
   derived from the panels in Stage II and develops a recommended
   portfolio of response strategies (Stage III).

Investment Portfolio

   When using the Vital Issues process to development an investment
   portfolio, the Vital Issues process is combined with classical
   optimization techniques to develop a value-optimized investment
   portfolio consisting of programs comprised of two or more elements. Two
   panels are utilized. After the initial panel identifies, defines, and
   ranks the criteria, the panelists on the second panel submit budget
   requests for individual programs and program elements, champion their
   programs, and use the criteria to rank the program elements. The
   results of the ranking are combined with classical optimization
   techniques to generate an investment portfolio consisting of only those
   program elements that contribute to the maximum net value overall
   within specified budgetary constraints. Alternative portfolios may also
   be generated in the context of several proposed budgets and
   combinations of criteria.

Successful Implementation of the Vital Issues Process

   The Vital Issues process has been under development since 1990. It has
   been used successfully in more than 70 applications ranging from
   environmental to energy to national security to human health. These
   panels are identified in the Vital Issues Panels table.
