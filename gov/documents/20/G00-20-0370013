   MISSION:
   Our division develops and applies new active optical sensing technology
   to provide information about atmospheric winds, aerosols, clouds,
   turbulence, humidity, and chemical species.
   The TEA CO2 Doppler lidar measures winds at TexAQS to understand
   pollution transport in the Houston area.
