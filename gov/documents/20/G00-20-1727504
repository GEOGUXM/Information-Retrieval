   FIRESCOPE (FIrefighting RESources of California Organized for Potential
   Emergencies) is a cooperative effort involving all agencies with fire
   fighting responsibilities in California
   FIRESCOPE was organized after the disastrous 1970 wildland fires in
   southern California. The goal of this group was to create and implement
   new applications in fire service management, technology and
   coordination, with an emphasis on incident command and multi-agency
   coordination. This dynamic state-wide program continues to serve the
   needs of the California Fire Service today.
