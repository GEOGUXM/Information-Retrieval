   #947 High-Volume, High-Speed Sequence Analysis on the Biowulf
        Supercluster

   Description:

   Sequencing projects and microarray analysis are producing sequence data
   at a rate that overwhelms traditional methods of sequence analysis. The
   Biowulf Linux supercluster, available to all NIH researchers, is
   ideally suited for sequence analysis with hundreds or thousands of
   sequences.
   Sequence analysis software available on Biowulf includes Blast, BLAT,
   Pfsearch and Hmmer. Several nucleotide/protein sequence databases are
   available, including the human genome. The cluster has over 1000
   processors, and will continue to be upgraded over the year 2002.

   Objectives:

   The course will cover:
     * an overview of Biowulf - accounts, disk space, etc.
     * what sorts of sequence analysis projects are suited for Biowulf
     * overview of the available sequence analysis software
     * how to set up and run a large-scale sequence analysis project
     * how to set up other analysis programs on a large scale
     * sequence databases available

   Who should attend:

   NIH researchers with an interest in large-scale sequence analysis

   Instructor(s):
