   BikePedMap Boulder is one of the most bicycle/pedestrian friendly
   cities in the country, with an extensive network of bicycle/pedestrian
   paths and on-street routes. The DOC Broadway campus is adjacent to the
   Broadway path, one of the main arteries in Boulder's path network. The
   east campus facility housing most of the NOAA labs is adjacent to the
   jewel of the path network, the Boulder Creek Path. These paths provide
   a pleasant alternative to crowded streets, and the network provides
   easy access to most of Boulder's neighborhoods. Plan your commute route
   with the Boulder Bike/Pedestrian Map
