   The Lost Participant List was updated on November 21, 2001.  This list
   is updated quarterly.

   The TSP is trying to find lost participants to assist them (or their
   beneficiaries) in claiming their accounts.  This list contains the
   name, last known state of residence, and last employing agency of
   approximately 14,800 participants who have separated from Federal
   service and whom the TSP has been unable to locate despite extensive
   efforts.

   If you think your TSP account has been declared abandoned, or if you
   know of a participant who may be lost to the TSP, you can search by:
     * Participant's Name
     * State of Residence
     * Employing Agency

   If you find your name or the name of someone you know, read What To Do
   If You Found The Name You Were Looking For.

   If you do not find your name or the name of someone whom you suspect is
   a lost participant, read What To Do If You Did Not Find The Name You
   Were Looking For.
