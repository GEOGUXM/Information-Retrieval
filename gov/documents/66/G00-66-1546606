NEAT Camera Successfully Tested on the Palomar 48" (Oschin) Sky Survey Telescope

ASTEROID HUNTERS BRING OLDIE-BUT-GOODIE INTO NEW AGE

   NASA astronomers searching for asteroids headed toward Earth are
   expanding their sky-watching repertoire by adding high-tech,
   computerized electronic upgrades to the classic 1.2-meter- diameter
   (48-inch) Oschin telescope atop Palomar Mountain near San Diego,
   California.

   The NEAT-Oschin alliance got a test run on June 9 and 10, when Pravdo
   and two other JPL astronomers, Dr. David Rabinowitz and Jeffrey
   Schroeder, took the NEAT camera to the Oschin telescope. They obtained
   the first-ever electronic images from that venerable sky eye.

  A number of asteroid detections were accomplished with the NEAT camera and
  Oschin 48" telescope. These observations are credited with the new observatory
  code 644, and are listed below:
