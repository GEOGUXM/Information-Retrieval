   Search Tips
     __________________________________________________________________

   To use this search page, you can look for a single word. Or, use the
   tips below to refine your search to find more specific results.
     * Look for a phrase.
       Example - type sports events to find the exact phrase sports
       events. Since the search is not case-sensitive, this is equivalent
       to Sports Events.
     * Look for two or more words at once by using the AND operator.
       Example - type sports AND events to find documents that have both
       the word sports and the word events anywhere.
     * Look for words that are close to each other by using the NEAR
       operator instead of the AND operator. When you use NEAR, the closer
       together the words are, the higher the rank of the page, so the
       higher it appears in the list of search results.
       Example - type sports NEAR events to match documents where the word
       sports is within 50 words of the word events.
     * Look for synonyms or similar words by using the OR operator. Note
       that if you don't use the OR operator and search using multiple
       words, the words are treated as a phrase.
       Example - type dogs OR puppies to find the word dogs or the word
       puppies, but not necessarily both.
     * Limit your search by using the AND NOT operator to exclude words.
       Example - type surfing AND NOT the Internet to find all instances
       of surfing, as long as surfing is not followed by the phrase the
       Internet.
     * Use double quotes if you want to use AND, OR, NOT, or NEAR
       literally.
       Example - type "houses near parks" to find documents with the
       phrase houses near parks. Without the double quotes, this query
       would use the NEAR operator instead of the phrase.
     * Use a single asterisk (*) to look for words that begin with the
       same letters.
       Example - type key* to find key, keying, keyhole, keyboard, and so
       on.
     * Use a double asterisk (**) to look for all forms of a word.
       Example - type fly** to match fly, flew, flown, and flying.
