                       1998 NOTES FROM NATIVE AMERICA

   (1)  "Native American Geometry," an internet website developed by a
   Window Rock, Arizona, archaeologist and teacher, was selected as Cool
   Math Site of the Week by the Canadian Mathematical Society s
   Knot-A-Braid site for the week of September 15-21, 1998. Recently it
   was chosen by San Francisco s Exploratorium as a Top Ten site for
   October. The site will also be featured on Bonus.com s Supersite For
   Kids.

   University of New Mexico Computer Science student and AISES member
   Shaun Tsabetsaye from Zuni, NM remarked, [The] website... is awesome.
   It's a breakthrough for Native American academics and philosophy.

   Juliana Marez, Title IX Indian Education teacher from Roseburg, Oregon
   commented, I really liked the way you put it together. You re right:
   when you do the art, math happens!

   Christopher Hardaker, the site's author and developer, says that
   "Native American Geometry is a 15-megabyte website that covers a broad
   range of hands-on exercises that integrates multicultural art with
   mathematics.

   Subject matter ranges from Chaco Canyon s great kivas and prehistoric
   art to Madison Avenue's logos. "Though the site was primarily designed
   for students and teachers between 4th and 12th Grades, the methodology
   was originally developed as an archaeological tool," says Hardaker. The
   site is sponsored by the Navajo Nation s Dine College where Hardaker is
   an adjunct professor.

   Hardaker, who has a M.A. in Anthropology (University of Arizona, 1989),
   is an educational consultant who has taught, lectured and given
   workshops for teachers (Grades 4-12) who are interested in what he
   calls "a revolutionary and scientific integration of art and
   mathematics for the cost of a compass and ruler." The geometry program
   seamlessly integrates the math with art traditions from around the
   world along with astronomy, architecture, Southwestern archaeology, and
   natural history.

   The Native American Geometry website is designed to introduce students,
   educators and scholars alike to a multicultural perspective of
   geometry. "This paradigmatic perspective prevailed for millennia among
   many civilizations and cultures around the world," Hardaker says, "and
   yet it has somehow been overlooked or forgotten by modern educators and
   academicians."

   MEDALS OF HONOR SOUGHT FOR NATIVE AMERICAN CODE TALKERS

   ANADARKO, OK, April 8, 1998 - Many of the American public know that in
   World War II a large number of Navajo served as "code talkers" for the
   Marines in the Pacific. There have been books and articles published
   which cover their service, and they have been highly honored in many
   ways.

   Fewer people are aware, however, that there were other code talkers in
   both World Wars from many tribes who served in the Pacific and in
   Europe. In all, at least 17 tribes have been identified as serving in
   this manner by Dr. William C. Meadows, an Anadarko, OK scholar whose
   book on the

   Comanche code talkers of World War II is currently under review by the
   University of Texas Press. The tribes identified include Cheyenne,
   Comanche, Cherokee, Choctaw, Osage, and Yankton Sioux in WW I, and in
   WW II, Chippewa, Creek, Hopi, Kiowa, Menominee,Comanche,
   Muscogee-Seminole, Navajo, Choctaw, Oneida, Pawnee, Sac & Fox, and
   Sioux (both Lakota and Dakota dialects).

   Meadows identifies two types of code talking, which he calls Type I and
   Type II. The former involved actual encoding of messages and
   translation of code into the code talkers' native languages. The second
   type involved the planned or spontaneous use of Native American
   languages to relay strategic messages without further encoding.

   An informational appendix is included below which identifies the tribes
   whose warriors served United States armed forces in this manner,
   beginning with the Choctaw in World War I, who practiced the first type
   of code talking. In all instances, the use of these native languages
   foiled enemy attempts to decipher the communications of United States
   armed forces.

   The result was often a dramatic turn in the tide of battle, and
   thousands of allied lives were saved which would have inevitably been
   lost in continued fighting.

   The code talking of these American Indian warriors was practiced under
   dangerous, harrowing conditions, willingly and without question.
   Perhaps even more remarkable, it was a service which they rendered to a
   government which had conquered their own people. Some of the code
   talkers lost their lives, and many were wounded during the two World
   Wars. Many of these brave men have since passed on to the land of the
   spirits, unrecognized by this country. The United States has never
   officially recognized the code talkers, although the French government
   awarded them or their tribes their highest military honor in 1989.

   Code Talking Types 1 and 2: Explanation

   Type 1 = Formally developed special coded-encoded vocabularies in

   Ohiyesa Remembers the Past

   (Lakota) Sioux

   As a child I understood how to give; I have forgotten this grace since
   I became civilized. I lived the natural life, whereas now I live the
   artificial. Any pretty pebble was valuable to me then; every growing
   tree an object of reverence. Now I worship with the white man before a
   painted landscape whose value is estimated in dollars! Thus the Indian
   is reconstructed, as the natural rocks are ground to powder and made
   into artificial blocks which may be built into the walls of modern
   society.

   The first American mingled with his pride a singular humility.
   Spiritual arrogance was foreign to his nature and teaching. He never
   claimed that the power of articulate speech was proof of superiority
   over the dumb creation; on the other hand, it is to him a perilous
   gift. He believes profoundly in silence - the sign of a perfect
   equilibrium. Silence is the absolute poise or balance of body, mind,
   and spirit. The man who preserves his selfhood is ever calm and
   unshaken by the storms of existence - not a leaf, as it were, astir on
   the tree; not a ripple upon the surface of the shining pool - his, in
   the mind of the unlettered sage, is the ideal attitude and conduct of
   life.

   If you ask him: "What is silence?" he will answer "It is the Great
   Mystery!" "The holy silence is His voice!" If you ask: "What are the
   fruits of silence?" he will say: "They are self-control, true courage
   or endurance, patience, dignity , and reverence. Silence is the
   cornerstone of character."

   "Guard your tongue in youth," said the old chief, Wabashaw, "and in age
   you may mature a thought that will be of service to your people!"

   from: Charles Alexander Eastman, The Soul of the Indian. Eastman
   (Ohiyesa) was born near Redwood Falls, MN, in 1858, His father was a
   full blooded Sioux, his mother the daughter of an army office,
   granddaughter of a famous Sioux chief. As a boy he lived still the free
   nomadic life of his people; later, however, he took up the ways of the
   white man, went to college, graduated in 1887 at Dartmouth College, NH,
   whereupon he took medical courses at Boston University.

   Even though virtually all of the coastal states and provinces of North
   American have European names, most of the states and provinces of the
   American interior still bear Indian names such as Yukon, Ontario,
   Manitoba, and Saskatchewan in the north, and Alabama, Mississippi,
   Texas - Caddo for "friend" - and Arizona in the south.

   Often these names reflect the tribal names of the people who lived in
   an area. Such names might be a tribe's own name for itself, or it might
   be the name given them by a neighboring group. We have states named for
   the Dakota, the Kansa, the Masachuset, the Illini, and the Utes. Some
   are names that describe the land or water. Iowa is a Siouan word for
   "beautiful land", Wyoming derives from the Algonquian word for a large
   prairie, Michigan is Ojibwa for "great water", and Minnesota is Siouan
   for "waters that reflect the sky". The original meanings are often
   rather straightforward, but translators and local boosters have usually
   worked to derive the most poetic names possible.

   Nebraska means "flat" or "broad river" in the Omaha language; this
   makes it similar in meaning but not pronunciation to the Algonquian
   term for "long river" that eventually became Connecticut. Ohio means
   "good river" in Iroquoian languages, and Oregon means "beautiful water"
   in Algonquian. Kentucky has one of the more mysterious meanings: "dark
   and bloody ground".

   The native people often gave such simple, descriptive names as these to
   places because such names had greater utilitarian value than the names
   of people. Because native people rarely made or used maps, descriptive
   names helped native travelers to recognize places.

   (7) I tried to answer one of your questions earlier this month on
   native customs of thanksgiving. Along these lines, I wanted to share
   this little bit of Ojibwe lore concerning their understanding of
   creation and origin of thanksgiving. I wish all of you a joyous holiday
   with your loved ones.

   #      #       #      #       #      #       #      #       #      #
       #      #        #

   With the creation of the physical world and the beings in it, the work
   of Creator (Kitchi-Manitou) was complete. Creator had done all that
   needed to be done. From that moment on, the onus was on men and women
   and their co-tenants on the Earth - the animals, birds, insects, fish,
   and plants - to continue the work put in motion by Creator. Creator had
   furnished them with all they required to fulfill their visions and
   purposes.

   Creator had done everything that was needed to be done and had provided
   all the means for humankind's well-being, growth and accomplishment, so
   Creator was finished with the world and would take no further part in
   humankind's affairs.

   But was the Creator's abdication from the world and its affairs an act
   of disinterest? On the contrary, creation was seen as the highest act
   of selflessness, of generosity, that anyone can perform - the sharing
   of one's gifts. And Creator's grant of fredom to human beings to seek
   and fulfill their visions and dreams according to their individual
   abilities as an act not only of generosity but of trust.

   And what obligation do the recipients and beneficiaries owe their
   benefactor for the abundance and variety of benefits received? What
   would be the most fitting gift to tender to Creator in recompense for
   all the things they received? Nothing. There was not a thing that human
   beings could offer Creator in return, other than to imitate Creator in
   the exercise of selflessness and generosity. By giving and sharing
   one's goods, knowledge, experience, and abilities with the less
   fortunate of their kin and neighbors - the elderly, sick, widows and
   orphans - human beings could emulate Creator.

   From the innate sense of gratitude felt by most men and women sprang
   the practice of offering thanksgiving on public occasions and in
   private.

   This is the last Note from Native America for this year. It has been my
   pleasure to provide information for you and also to receive the
   numerous comments and expressions of support. My thanks goes out to you
   all.

   On Nov. 13 and 14, I was fortunate to be able to attend the Department
   of the Interior Tribal College Summit, in which the Executive Order
   establishing agency support for Tribal Colleges and Universities was
   examined and discussed. There was a lot of enthusiastic energy in the
   DOI team which put the Summit together. It was exciting for me to come
   away with ideas for many potential opportunities for the Office of
   Surface Mining to be able to implement the Order. I hope to be able to
   continue assisting OSM in this regard, helping to enhance education at
   all levels in Indian Country. Next year in November, I hope to be able
   to report to you some of the advances made in those OSM programs
   involving theTribal College Initiative.

   Attached is a copy of Executive Order 13021 -Tribal Colleges and
   Universities
