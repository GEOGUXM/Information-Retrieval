   INTRODUCTION This document is intended to assist public agencies and
   other interested parties considering the purchase of low emission
   vehicles. The document is divided into three sections: Funding
   Opportunities, Vehicles and Fueling Infrastructure. This document
   focuses on vehicles that are powered by alternative fuels, primarily
   natural gas or electricity. This document draws extensively on
   information from other agencies and sources, many of which are cited in
   the text. A list of useful resources and websites is provided in
   Appendix A. Over the past nine years, the Bay Area Air Quality
   Management District (Air District), through its Transportation Fund for
   Clean Air (TFCA) program, has awarded over $60 million toward a wide
   range of low emission vehicle projects in local public fleets. These
   projects are accelerating the introduction of low emission vehicles
   into the Bay Area. Benefits of low emission vehicles: There are a wide
   range of potential benefits from alternative fuel, low emission
   vehicles, including: * reduced motor vehicle emissions of ozone
   precursors (smog), particulate matter, and air toxics * less air
   pollution from oil refining, fuel dispensing, evaporative emissions,
   etc. * reduced emissions of carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse gases"
   that contribute to global warming * reduced water pollution (motor
   vehicles are a major source of non-point water pollution) * reduced
   petroleum consumption, and greater diversity of energy sources to fuel
   vehicles * reduced vehicle operating costs (fuel, maintenance, etc.)
   For a good overview of the environmental impacts of motor vehicles, see
   www.greenercars.com/autoenviron.html (from the American Council for an
   Energy Efficient Economy). Energy Impacts - Cost and Supply of
   Electricity and Natural Gas: The current energy crisis in California
   raises questions as to the impact that greater numbers of electric and
   natural gas vehicles might have in terms of increasing the demand for,
   and cost of, these energy sources. Electric and natural gas vehicles
   currently account for just a fraction of one percent of the demand for
   these energy sources in California. Under the most optimistic scenarios
   for increasing the number of electric and natural gas vehicles, the
   transportation sector will still account for only a tiny percentage of
   the demand for electricity and natural gas in the next 10-20 years.
   Staff analysis at the Energy Commission and the Air Resources Board
   suggests that increasing the number of alternative fuel vehicles will
   not exacerbate the energy crisis. For further discussion on the energy
   impacts of alternative fuel vehicles, see Appendix B. Transportation
   Fund for Clean Air Page 1 May 2001 BAAQMD Guide to Low Emission
   Vehicles Regulatory Framework: Vehicle purchase decisions for public
   fleets are influenced by state and federal laws. The California Air
   Resources Board (CARB) continues to require cleaner cars for
   California. CARB regulations mandate that automobile manufacturers
   produce zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) and other advanced technology,
   clean air vehicles for the California market. (For further discussion
   on the CARB ZEV mandate, see the section on electric vehicles.) The
   federal government, concerned over the nation's reliance on imported
   oil, requires that the vehicle fleets of federal and state agencies
   acquire alternative fuel vehicles. The Energy Policy Act of 1992
   includes provisions for the U.S. Department of Energy to adopt
   requirements for municipal and private fleets to acquire low emission
   vehicles. It is not clear if or when DOE will impose such requirements
   on local fleets. However, many fleet managers are interested in gaining
   experience with low emission vehicles in anticipation of government
   mandates, and while funding is available to offset the incremental
   costs of these vehicles. Local programs and policies: Local agencies
   can play an important role in laying the groundwork for clean air
   vehicles in their communities. In addition to acquiring clean vehicles
   for their agency fleets, local governments can implement measures to
   provide electric vehicle charging stations and to provide for
   enforcement of electric vehicle parking policies. The Air District
   recently adopted a Model Clean Air Vehicle Ordinance that provides a
   comprehensive set of policies and actions that local agencies can
   implement to promote the use of clean air vehicles. For more
   information, contact David Burch at dburch@baaqmd.gov or 415-749-4641.
   Several jurisdictions in the Bay Area have adopted clean fleet
   regulations (e.g. the City and County of San Francisco and Contra Costa
   County). The City of San Jose approved free parking for electric and
   natural gas vehicles in April 2001. Project Development Assistance The
   Air District staff listed below are available to help in the
   development of projects and applications for the various Air District
   funding programs. Matt Nichols Medium & Heavy Duty 415/749-4982

   2001 FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES Natural gas and electric vehicles typically
   cost more than similar gasoline or diesel vehicles. The incremental
   cost of the low emission vehicle depends upon the specific vehicle
   type. Natural gas and electric vehicles may also require additional
   expenditures for fueling or charging equipment. The Air District
   administers the following programs to provide funding assistance for
   low emission vehicle projects: * Transportation Fund for Clean Air
   (TFCA) * Vehicle Incentive Program (VIP) * Charge! Grant Program to
   Install Public Electric Vehicle Charging Facilities * Carl Moyer
   Memorial Air Quality Standards Attainment Program * Lower-Emission
   School Bus Program Table 1 provides a summary of the Air District's
   funding programs. A narrative description of each funding program
   follows Table 1. Detailed guidelines for each program can be downloaded
   on the www.baaqmd.gov website - go to the home page and cursor down to
   the "Reduce Vehicle Emissions" section. In addition to the Air District
   funding programs described below, State and Federal agencies have
   developed a variety of incentives and policies to promote alternative
   fuel, low emission vehicles. These are described in the section that
   follows the summary of BAAQMD funding programs. Transportation Fund for

   Transportation Fund for Clean Air Page 4 BAAQMD Guide to Low Emission
   Vehicles May 2001 The Transportation Fund for Clean Air (TFCA) The TFCA
   program provides funding to public agencies for a wide range of
   projects to reduce motor vehicle emissions, including various types of
   alternative fuel, low emission vehicle projects. TFCA funds are
   distributed via two processes: TFCA Program Manager Funds: 40% of TFCA
   revenues are returned to the county of origin and distributed via the
   County Program Manager. A list of Program Managers is provided in Table
   2. TFCA Regional Funds: The remaining 60% of TFCA revenues  the TFCA
   Regional Funds - are allocated directly by the Air District through a
   competitive process. Public agencies may request funding for the
   various types of eligible clean air vehicle projects either from the
   TFCA Regional Fund or from the appropriate County Program Manager. TFCA
   Regional Funds are available to cover the incremental cost of low
   emission vehicles (but not refueling infrastructure). TFCA Program
   Manager funds are potentially available to cover both low emission
   vehicles and the refueling/recharging infrastructure needed to support
   the vehicles. For TFCA purposes, low emission vehicle projects are
   divided into the following categories: 1. Light duty vehicles with a
   gross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or less. (Note: incentives for
   light duty vehicles are provided through the Vehicle Incentive Program
   see below) 2. Medium and heavy duty vehicles with a gross vehicle
   weight of more than 10,000 pounds 3. School buses and transit buses 4.
   Special use vehicles, such as parking enforcement vehicles and utility
   carts Incentives for vehicles in categories #2 through #4 are available
   via the TFCA Regional Fund competitive process. For low emission
   vehicles with a GVW of more than 10,000 pounds, project sponsors may
   request no more than the incremental cost of the cleaner vehicle.
   Incremental cost is the difference in the purchase prices of the clean
   air vehicle and its diesel or gasoline counterpart. However, public
   transit agencies which have elected to pursue the `alternative fuel'
   path under CARB's urban transit bus regulation may apply for up to
   $150,000 per alternative fuel transit bus (30 ft. or longer),
   regardless of the incremental cost. In accordance with Health & Safety
   Code Section 44241, only public agencies are eligible to receive TFCA
   funding. However, public agencies may submit applications on behalf of
   private fleets in certain circumstances, subject to the criteria and
   conditions defined in TFCA Policy #5 (Non-Public Entities). The text of
   TFCA policy #5 is provided in the TFCA Regional Fund Application
   Guidance document. The TFCA Application Guidance and Forms is available
   at www.baaqmd.gov/planning/plntrns/tfcapage.htm. Copies may also be
   requested by sending an e- mail message to tfca@baaqmd.gov or calling
   the TFCA document request line at 415-749-4994. The deadline for FY
   01/02 TFCA Regional Fund applications is June 29, 2001. Transportation

   Program (VIP) TFCA funds for light duty vehicles with a gross vehicle
   weight of 10,000 pounds or less are distributed through the Vehicle
   Incentive Program (VIP). VIP is a streamlined program to provide fixed
   incentives to public agencies for the purchase or lease of electric,
   natural gas, or propane cars, pick-up trucks, and vans. Vehicles must
   be certified to the California Air Resources Board's ultra low emission
   vehicles (ULEVs), super low emission vehicles (SULEVs), or zero
   emission vehicles (ZEVs) standard to be eligible for VIP incentives.
   VIP funds are awarded on a first-come, first- served basis. In FY
   00/01, the Air District allocated a total of $1.2 million for VIP
   incentives, including $1 million for the basic VIP program, and
   $200,000 to provide incentives for high mileage vehicles (defined as
   vehicles that are driven 75,000 miles per year or more). In June 2001,
   Air District staff will present a recommended FY 2001/02 VIP program to
   the District's Board of Directors. Specific VIP incentive amounts and
   program guidelines will be defined at that time. VIP application forms
   will be mailed out in July 2001, and will be posted on the District
   website at that time. Applications for the FY 2001/02 VIP program will
   be accepted beginning in September 2001. Questions about the VIP
   program may be directed to David Burch at dburch@baaqmd.gov or
   415-749-4641. Carl Moyer Memorial Air Quality Standards Attainment
   Program The purpose of the Carl Moyer program is to reduce emissions of
   oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from heavy-duty engines by providing grants
   for the incremental cost of lower-emission engines (cleaner diesel or
   alternative fuel). Both private entities and public agencies are
   eligible to apply for Carl Moyer funds. Applications for FY 00/01 Carl
   Moyer funds were due in February 2001. The Air District expects to
   award the grants in June 2001. Staff anticipates that applications for
   the next round of Carl Moyer funds will be accepted early in year 2002.
   Printed copies of the Carl Moyer Program Guidelines and application
   forms are available from the CARB Public Information Office, 2020 L
   Street, Sacramento, 95814 (phone: 916-322-2990). Electronic copies are
   available from CARB's web site, www.arb.ca.gov. For additional
   assistance, please contact Michael Murphy at 415-749-4644 or
   mmurphy@baaqmd.gov. Transportation Fund for Clean Air Page 6 BAAQMD
   Guide to Low Emission Vehicles May 2001 Lower-Emission School Bus
   Program This program provides funding to replace or retrofit older
   school buses to reduce harmful emissions of diesel particulate matter
   and oxides of nitrogen. Funds are available for purchasing new, lower-
   emitting school buses and for retrofitting buses with particulate
   filters to reduce particulate emissions. The program will fund the
   purchase of about 350 new buses and 2000 particulate filters for diesel
   school buses statewide. The program also provides funding for
   infrastructure associated with alternative fuels, and new intermediate
   emission diesel engines. Both the new diesel buses and the particulate
   filters require the use of low-sulfur diesel fuel. The Air District
   received $9.1 million from CARB for the school bus replacement program,
   and $2.3 million for the particulate filter program. Applications for
   the bus replacement program were due May 16, 2001. The deadline to
   apply for the particulate filter retrofit program is August 15, 2001.
   Please contact Andrea Gordon at 415-749-4940 or agordon@baaqmd.gov.
   More information is also available at
   www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/schoolbus/schoolbus.htm. Charge! Grants for
   Electric Vehicle Charging Facilities The Charge! program provides
   grants to help install publicly-accessible electric vehicle charging
   stations in the Bay Area. Public and private entities may apply for
   funding to help offset the cost of purchasing and installing EV
   chargers. Funding is currently limited to 40% of the total cost of the
   chargers, with a maximum funding cap of $7,000 per site for a site with
   one conductive charger and one inductive charger. Applications are
   accepted and reviewed on an ongoing basis. Application forms and
   additional information about the Charge! program are available on the
   District website. District staff expects to propose revisions to the
   Charge! program for consideration by our Board of Directors in Fall
   2001. Questions concerning the Charge! program should be addressed to
   David Burch at dburch@baaqmd.gov or 415-749-4641. Additional Funding
   Opportunities, Incentives and Policies In addition to the Air District
   funding programs that are described above, there are a variety of
   incentives (monetary and non-monetary) and policies available to
   promote the use of alternative fuel, low emission vehicles. CARB Zero
   Emission Vehicle (ZEV) incentive program: In Fall 2000, the Governor
   signed AB 2061 (Lowenthal). This bill allocated $18 million in state
   funds to the California Air Resource Board to provide an incentive of
   $9,000 per vehicle for qualifying electric vehicles. The CARB
   incentives will be available through December 31, 2002 for new electric
   vehicles that meet the criteria defined in AB 2061. Eligible applicants
   include private fleets and private individuals, as well as local and
   state government agencies. (The CARB incentives are not available for
   electric vehicles that were previously leased, unless the vehicle has
   been "substantially upgraded" as defined by CARB.) Applications and
   guidelines for the CARB ZEV incentive are available at www.zevinfo.com.
   Note: In order to avoid duplication and conserve VIP funds, the Air
   District will not accept VIP applications for electric vehicles that
   are eligible for the CARB incentive. The District will accept VIP
   applications for electric vehicles that are not covered by the CARB
   program: i.e. small neighborhood EVs and three-wheel EVs (e.g. the
   Corbin Sparrow). The District will also accept applications for VIP
   incentives to renew or extend existing electric vehicle leases as they
   expire, since renewal of EV leases is generally not covered under the
   CARB program. Transportation Fund for Clean Air Page 7 May 2001 BAAQMD
   Guide to Low Emission Vehicles CARB EV Loaner Program: Public agencies
   are encouraged to take advantage of the EV Loaner Program administered
   by the Air Resources Board and the California Department of General
   Services. Information on this program is available at
   www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/loanprog/loanprog.htm California Energy
   Commission programs: The CEC has a variety of programs to provide
   funding for alternative fuel vehicles and the refueling infrastructure
   needed to support such vehicles. A summary of the CEC funding programs
   is available at http://www.energy.ca.gov/afvs/index.html. For
   information on CEC funding for fueling infrastructure for alternative
   fuel vehicles, contact Peter Ward at pward@energy.state.ca.us or
   916-654-4639. The CEC is currently developing an "Advanced and
   Efficient Vehicle Incentive Program." For information, check the CEC
   website in summer or fall 2001. Reduced Vehicle License Fee: As noted
   above, the cost of alternative fuel vehicles is typically higher than
   an equivalent gasoline or diesel vehicle. Vehicle license fees in
   California are based upon the market value of the vehicle. Legislation
   (SB 1782) was enacted in fall 1998 to exempt the incremental cost of
   alternative fuel vehicles for purposes of calculating the vehicle
   license fee. This applies to new light-duty, alternative fuel vehicles,
   certified to ULEV or ZEL standards. For example, the license fee for a
   natural gas version of a Ford F-150 would be the same as for the
   gasoline version of the vehicle. The bill removes any disincentive for
   alternative fuel vehicles in the way that vehicle license fees are
   calculated. SB 1782 is currently set to expire as of December 31, 2002.
   For additional information, contact Dara Dubois of the California
   Energy Commission at Ddubois@energy.state.ca.us or 916-654-4651. HOV
   lane access for low emission vehicles: Assembly Bill 71 allows owners
   of natural gas and battery electric vehicles that achieve the SULEV or
   ZEV emission standard to use the state's high occupancy vehicle lane
   network, as described below. The vehicle owner must obtain a special
   sticker from the Department of Motor Vehicles. Single-occupant vehicles
   equipped with the special sticker are allowed to use the HOV lanes at
   all times and are also exempt from bridge tolls when HOV lane hours are
   in effect. Note that AB 71 applies to natural gas and battery electric
   vehicles only. Hybrid electric vehicles do not qualify for the HOV lane
   access sticker. For additional information, see
   http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/carpool/carpool.htm. Federal tax credits
   and deductions: The federal tax code provides a tax credit for
   qualified electric vehicles. Please note that this credit may not be
   directly available to the consumer if the EV is leased. Taxpayers must
   file IRS Form 8834 to claim the electric vehicle credit. Form 8834 can
   be downloaded at http://ftp.fedworld.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8834.pdf In
   addition, federal tax deductions are available for heavy duty vehicles
   powered by alternative fuels. And certain costs related to electric and
   natural gas vehicles and infrastructure can be deducted as business
   expenses under IRS Code Sections 30 and 179A. This is explained in
   Chapter 12 of Publication 535 (Business Expenses). Publication 535 can
   be downloaded at http://ftp.fedworld.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p535.pdf. Specific
   questions can be directed to Jolene Shiraishi at the IRS at
   202-622-3120. A good overview of the federal tax credits and deductions
   is available at
   www.consumerenergycenter.org/transportation/afv/incentives.html.
   Transportation Fund for Clean Air Page 8 BAAQMD Guide to Low Emission
   Vehicles May 2001 LIGHT & MEDIUM DUTY VEHICLES Under the terms of the
   low emissions standards defined by California Air Resources Board
   (CARB), clean air light and medium duty vehicles can be certified to
   either the ultra low emission vehicle (ULEV), super ultra low emission
   vehicle (SULEV), or zero emission vehicle (ZEV) standard. A wide range
   of vehicles are now available that achieve either the ULEV, SULEV, or
   ZEV standards, including electric vehicles, natural gas vehicles,
   gasoline hybrid electric vehicles, and gasoline vehicles. A list of the
   alternative fuel vehicles that achieve these standards is available in
   Table 3. A complete list of vehicles (including gasoline vehicles) that
   meet these standards is available on the CARB website at
   www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/ccbg/ccbg.htm. The CARB list is updated as new
   vehicles are certified to these standards. Electric Vehicles Battery
   electric vehicles (also referred to as zero emission vehicles or ZEVs)
   are now available in limited quantities in California. Production and
   marketing of EVs has been driven by the ZEV mandate which was first
   adopted by the California Air Resources Board in 1990. In its September
   2000 biennial review, the CARB Board voted unanimously to sustain the
   ZEV mandate. On January 25, 2001, the Board adopted revisions to the
   ZEV mandate to provide greater flexibility to automakers. The revisions
   allow the automakers to earn credits toward the ZEV requirements by
   producing a variety of advanced technology vehicles (hybrid electric
   vehicles, neighborhood electric vehicles, and other vehicles that
   qualify for partial ZEV credit). The January 2001 revisions reduce the
   number of ZEVs that the automakers are required to produce in the near
   term, but retain the core requirements of the ZEV program. Information
   on electric vehicles is available from many sources, including the CARB
   ZEV website at www.zevinfo.com. The supply of EVs is expected to
   increase in the next couple of years in response to the CARB ZEV
   mandate. To date, however, the automakers have not released details of
   their plans to comply with the ZEV mandate. In the short term, the
   selection and quantity of battery electric vehicles will continue to be
   limited. The electric vehicles that qualify for incentives under the
   VIP and CARB ZEV incentive programs are included in Table 3 above.
   Electric vehicles are generally offered on a three-year lease basis;
   however, the Solectria Force is available for purchase. The maximum
   driving range of electric vehicles is limited compared to the range of
   conventional vehicles. The maximum distance that today's electric
   vehicles can be driven before needing to recharge ranges for 40 to 125
   miles. Driving range is determined primarily by the size and weight of
   the vehicle, as well as the type of batteries. Vehicles equipped with
   advanced batteries (e.g. nickel metal hydride (NiMH) or lithium ion)
   generally offer greater range than vehicle with lead acid batteries.
   However, vehicles with lead acid batteries are typically cheaper, and
   they are ideal for certain applications, such as short or medium
   distance fixed daily routes. Many public and private fleets employ
   their vehicles on duty cycles that are well-suited to electric
   vehicles. In addition to the full size, general purpose EVs listed in
   Table 3, there are a variety of smaller electric vehicles in the
   market. These vehicles are oftern referred to as "city EVs" or
   "neighborhood EVs." They generally offer lower speed and reduced range,
   but they may be well suited to specific applications or niche markets
   such as parking enforcement, campus environments, etc. Many of the
   automakers are considering marketing "city EVs" or "neighborhood EVs"
   to help comply with the EV production targets in the CARB ZEV mandate.

   Vehicles Two gasoline/electric hybrid vehicles  the Toyota Prius and
   the Honda Insight  are now available in the American market. Other
   manufacturers plan to introduce hybrid technology within the next few
   years in a wide range of vehicles. Hybrid EVs may offer significant
   advantages in terms of fuel economy and reduced emissions, without the
   limited range and special infrastructure associated with natural gas
   and electric vehicles. There are many potential designs or
   configurations for hybrid vehicles, and the benefit in terms of
   improved fuel economy and lower emissions can be expected to vary
   significantly among the different vehicles. Under existing Air District
   policy, hybrid electric vehicles are eligible for VIP incentives only
   if their batteries can be recharged directly from the electric grid
   (so-called "plug-in" hybrids). (See the definition of "clean air
   vehicle" in TFCA Policy #13.) The Honda Insight and the Toyota Prius
   are not plug-in hybrids, and are therefore not eligible for VIP
   incentives under the existing (FY 00/01) program guidelines.
   Eligibility of hybrid vehicles may be reconsidered under the guidelines
   for the upcoming FY 2001/02 VIP program. Light Duty Natural Gas
   Vehicles Ford, Honda, Toyota and Chrysler offer model year 2001 ULEV-
   and SULEV-certified, dedicated natural gas vehicles. Natural gas
   vehicles certified to the ULEV or SULEV standards are listed in Table 4
   above. Contact any dealership for purchasing information. For Honda CNG
   vehicles, contact any of the three local dealers listed in Table 4
   above. Fuel Cell Vehicles Fuel cells are a promising new vehicle
   propulsion technology. Many vehicle manufacturers are currently
   conducting intensive research and development on fuel cell vehicles. A
   number of agencies and manufacturers have joined forces in the
   California Fuel Cell Partnership  see www.fuelcellpartnership.org .
   Fuel cells are not expected to be widely available in production
   vehicles in the next few years. However, they offer tremendous
   potential in the medium and long term, both for light duty vehicles and
   for larger vehicles such as transit buses. A key issue is the fuel
   stock for fuel cells. Gasoline, methanol, or pure hydrogen are the
   leading fuel stock candidates, but each one has its pros and cons.
   There appears to be consensus that pure hydrogen is the long term
   solution. However, hydrogen is a very volatile fuel, and there are
   issues that must be resolved in terms of safe use of hydrogen, as well
   as creating the necessary distribution network. Heavy Duty Vehicles
   Most heavy duty vehicles are diesel-powered. In recent years, diesel
   emissions have been identified as a major source of particulate matter
   and air toxics. This has drawn attention to the need to develop cleaner
   diesel fuel and engines, as well as encourage the use of alternative
   fuels, including compressed natural gas and liquified natural gas.
   Unlike light and medium duty vehicles, emissions certification for
   heavy-duty vehicles is based on the engine only (i.e., it is not
   vehicle-specific). A heavy-duty vehicle may be equipped with one of any
   number of engines; therefore, the California Air Resources Board
   certifies engines and not vehicles. Table 5 provides a list of natural
   gas and propane engines certified by CARB to the optional low-NOx
   standards as of the printing of this document. Updates to this table
   are available at http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/moyer/certs.htm.

   2001 BAAQMD Guide to Low Emission Vehicles INFRASTRUCTURE Electric
   Vehicle Charging There are two primary charging technologies available
   - conductive and inductive  and several different systems are currently
   in use for recharging battery electric vehicles. Most full-size EVs
   generally use either an on-board conductive or an off-board inductive
   220 volt charging system. Some smaller EVs (e.g. the Corbin Sparrow)
   use 110 volt charging. Conductive charging uses the plug concept of
   metal-to-metal contact to transfer electricity to the vehicle's battery
   pack. Ford, Honda, and Solectria use conductive charging. Inductive
   charging transfers electricity through a magnetic coupler. GM, Toyota,
   and Nissan currently use inductive charging systems in their EVs. Table
   6 lists companies that sell electric vehicle recharging equipment. In
   June 2001, the California Air Resources Board will consider a staff
   proposal to require a standard charging technology. CARB staff is
   recommending "on-board" conductive charging as the standard. The
   proposed regulation would apply to all vehicles that would qualify for
   full credit (1.0 credits or more) under the CARB ZEV mandate, beginning
   in year 2006. If adopted, CARB's proposal to standardize EV charging
   technology should help lay the groundwork for large-scale introduction
   of electric vehicles, and also reduce the cost of complexity of
   developing and maintaining a network of public access electric vehicle
   charging stations. However, it will be necessary to support both
   inductively and conductively charged EVs in the interim period when
   both technologies are in use. In California, Sacramento Municipal
   Utility District is the exclusive distributor of inductive GM
   "Magnecharger" equipment and Toyota "Gen 3" chargers. Clean Fuel
   Connection works as a subcontractor to SMUD and can provide a full
   range of services (e.g. arranging for cost estimates, consultations,
   grant-writing, etc.). Funding assistance for the purchase of publicly
   accessible chargers is available through the Air District's Charge!
   program. In addition, site owners may be eligible for federal tax
   deductions for costs related to installation of EV charging sites (see
   the section on federal tax credits and deduction above). A directory of
   electric vehicle charging stations is available at
   www.cleancarmaps.com. Stations are listed by geographic location. The
   site also provides map locator software. The California Energy
   Commission (CEC) administers an Electric Vehicle Infrastructure
   Incentive Program to reduce the cost of installing EV chargers for
   customers who lease electric vehicles. The CEC incentive is a matching
   grant program in collaboration with participating automakers. The CEC
   contributes $750; this is matched by the automaker, for a total
   incentive of $1,500. The incentive funds may be used to cover the cost
   of hardware and/or installation. For information see

   gas fueling station is available on the California Natural Gas Vehicle
   Coalition website at www.califngv.org. Stations are listed
   geographically; the site also provides map locator software. The
   directory is also available in booklet form by contacting the NGV
   Coalition at califngv@cwo.com or 916-448-5036. Costs to construct a
   natural gas fueling station vary significantly, depending upon the
   capacity and specifications for the station. Companies interested in
   building and operating natural gas fueling stations in the Bay Area are
   listed in Table 7. Many of these companies are willing to construct and
   operate a compressed natural gas refueling station in exchange for a
   guaranteed level of fuel sales over a given period of time. The list in
   Table 7 was developed by PG&E. It is not all inclusive and is not
   intended as an endorsement from PG&E or the Air District. Fuelmaker
   Corporation makes a low-cost slow-fill fueling device that is
   well-suited for low volume operations, such as fleet vehicles that can
   be refueled at night. See www.fuelmaker.com. Transportation Fund for

   Vehicles May 2001 Appendix B Energy Impacts of Alternative Fuel
   Vehicles Given the current energy shortage, it is important to consider
   the potential energy impacts associated with electric vehicles and
   other alternative fuel vehicles. In the short term, EVs and other
   alternative fuel vehicles will have no significant impact on the demand
   for electricity or other sources of energy. In the long term, promoting
   alternative fuel vehicles should diversify our energy supply and reduce
   our dependence on petroleum in the transportation sector. A more
   diversified vehicle fleet can help to reduce our vulnerability to
   shortages or price increases in any one sector of the energy market.
   Key points are summarized below: * The transportation sector accounts
   for only a fraction of one percent of current natural gas consumption
   in California, according to data from the California Energy Commission
   staff. * In the next 3-5 years, the number of electric vehicles on the
   road will remain small, and their aggregate electricity demand will be
   negligible. Even by the year 2010 (long after our current energy crisis
   will have ended), EVs will use less than three-tenths of one percent of
   today's electrical demand. * Most EVs will be primarily recharged at
   night when there is excess capacity in the electrical grid. PG&E offers
   a special rate structure to EV drivers to encourage off-peak charging.
   * Electric (and hybrid electric) vehicles are inherently more efficient
   in energy use compared to internal combustion engines. Also, EVs
   recapture a portion of the energy they use through regenerative
   braking. Local agencies should consider the energy situation in their
   plans to acquire alternative fuel vehicles. They should evaluate both
   the capital and operating costs associated with the various types of
   conventional and alternative fuel vehicles. Although their initial
   purchase or lease cost is generally higher, electric and natural gas
   vehicles have traditionally offered savings in terms of fuel costs and
   other operating costs (i.e. reduced maintenance costs) compared to
   gasoline vehicles. In recent years, the cost to drive battery electric
   vehicles has typically been 30-40% of the cost of gasoline on a per
   mile basis. Even with a significant increase in electric prices, EVs
   should still be cheaper to operate, based upon overall fuel and
   maintenance costs. Prices for natural gas did experience a sharp spike
   on the short term "spot market" this past winter. However, natural
   prices are already declining, and forecasts call for the price of
   natural gas to return to more normal levels in the near term. Many
   agencies that use natural gas vehicles have been able to negotiate
   long-term contracts that protect against short-term fluctuations in the
   price of the fuel. The prices of all fuels (gasoline, diesel, natural
   gas, and electricity) are dynamic. We have also experienced significant
   price spikes for gasoline in California in recent years, and gasoline
   prices are headed up again as we enter summer 2001. No one can predict
   with certainty the future price of any one fuel, nor the price of
   natural gas relative to gasoline. However, by moving to diversify their
   fleets, public agencies and other fleet operators can reduce their
   vulnerability to rapid increases in the cost of any one fuel, be that
   gasoline, diesel, natural gas, or electricity. Rather than exacerbating
   our energy problems, alternative fuel vehicles can be part of the
   long-term solution. Transportation Fund for Clean Air Page 19
