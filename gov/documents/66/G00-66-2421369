   The Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program produces
   employment and wage estimates for over 700 occupations. These are
   estimates of the number of people employed in certain occupations, and
   estimates of the wages paid to them. Self-employed persons are not
   included in the estimates. These estimates are available for the nation
   as a whole, for individual States, and for metropolitan areas; national
   occupational estimates for specific industries are also available.

   Special Notices:

   The Bureau of Labor Statistics is able to produce the occupational
   employment and wage estimates displayed on this website because of the
   timely co-operation of employers throughout the United States. If your
   workplace received an Occupational Employment Statistics survey form
   please complete it and return it to the State employment security
   agency that sent it to you. If you have returned a completed survey
   form, Thank you!

   Old OES and New SOC occupational classification systems: Begining with
   the 1999 estimates the OES program discontinued the use of five-digit
   OES codes to identify occupational categories and began using the
   Standard Occupational Classification system.

                            People are asking...

            1. How does the OES program produce these estimates?

                 2. How are "employees" and "wages" defined?

     3. Does the OES program have State and Metropolitan Area estimates?

               4. Does the OES program have demographic data?

             5. What about estimates for self-employed persons?

          6. Are industry-specific estimates available for States?
