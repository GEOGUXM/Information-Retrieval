   Wages
        __________________________________________________________________

   The U.S. Department of Labor enforces the Fair Labor Standards Act
   (FLSA), which sets basic minimum wage and overtime pay standards. These
   standards are enforced by the Department's Wage and Hour Division, a
   program of the Employment Standards Administration.

   Workers who are covered by the FLSA are entitled to a minimum wage of
   not less than $5.15 an hour. Overtime pay at a rate of not less than
   one and one-half times their regular rate of pay is required after 40
   hours of work in a workweek. Certain exemptions apply to specific types
   of businesses or specific types of work.

   The FLSA does not, however, require severance pay, sick leave,
   vacations, or holidays.

   In addition to the FLSA, the Wage and Hour Division enforces other
   labor laws related to wage payment. Among these are:

    the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts, which require payment of prevailing
   wage rates and fringe benefits on federally-financed or assisted
   construction;

    the Service Contract Act, which requires payment of prevailing wage
   rates and fringe benefits on contracts to provide services to the
   federal government;

    the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, which sets overtime
   standards for most federal service contracts, federally funded
   construction contracts, and federal supply contracts over $100,000; and

    the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act, which requires payment of
   minimum wage rates and overtime pay on federal contracts to manufacture
   or provide goods to the federal government.

   The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides for up to 12 weeks of
   unpaid leave for certain medical and family situations (e.g., adoption)
   for either the employee or a member of the covered and eligible
   employee's immediate family; however, in many instances paid leave may
   be substituted for unpaid FMLA leave.

   The Immigration Act of 1990 applies to employers seeking to hire
   nonimmigrant aliens as workers in specialty occupations under H-1B
   visas.
