              Administrative Record and Information Repository

                                  [bar.gif]

   Introduction:

   In response to public comments, the Information Repository and
   Administrative Record computer stations have been upgraded to increase
   the system's user-friendliness. If you would like additional
   information, assistance, or to comment on the system, please contact
   your local INEEL Regional Office representative:

          Boise - Cheryl Burgess, (208) 334-9572
          Idaho Falls - Reuel Smith, (208) 526-6864

   If the INEEL Regional Office representative is unavailable, please
   contact Doug Empey, of the INEEL Community Relations Program, toll-free
   at 1-800-708-2680 or Joy Stuart at (208) 526-2077.

   The following provides details on the computer stations' purpose,
   organization, options for accessing and sorting information, and
   additional information on operating the system.

   The Computer Stations' Purpose

   The Information Repository and Administrative Record collections
   provide public access to information concerning DOE's Environmental
   Restoration Program at the INEEL.

   The Information Repository contains background information and current
   studies involving the INEEL and general cleanup activities, technical
   studies, post-Record of Decision documents, including Remedial Design
   and Remedial Action documents, and other information on the INEEL that
   may be of interest to the public.

   The Administrative Record is the collection of documents used by the
   Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, and State of
   Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to form the basis of their
   cleanup decisions. The purpose of the Administrative Record is to
   provide information on the project being investigated and to maintain
   the collection of documents required by law if a cleanup action
   decision is challenged. In addition, the Administrative Record limits
   the judicial review of the adequacy of a response action. It acts as a
   vehicle for public participation in selecting a response action because
   the Administrative Record must be made available for public inspection
   and comment during the appropriate comment periods.

   How the System is Organized

   Potential and confirmed waste release sites addressed by the INEEL
   Environmental Restoration Program are divided into specific units for
   operation and management purposes. These units are called waste area
   groups (WAGs). There are 10 WAGs at the INEEL. Each WAG is further
   broken down into operable units (OUs), which are groupings of potential
   or confirmed release sites used to identify similar contamination
   problems. The number of OUs differs from one WAG to another.

   When referring to an OU, the WAG number is given first, followed by a
   hyphen and a two-digit number assigned to the specific OU within the
   WAG. For example, if you are looking for information on Pit 9 (OU 10 of
   WAG 7), look for binder number 7-10 in the hard copy or OU 7-10 in the
   computer system.

   The organization of the system will allow the user to access
   information in the following ways:

   When accessing the Administrative Record using the hard copy, the
   binders are organized with an index in the first volume of each OU that
   describes each document included in the Administrative Record, followed
   by a copy of the documents.

   When accessing the Administrative Record using the computer, begin by
   selecting either About this web site or one of the other selections to
   view specific documents:

   About this web site

   Choosing About this web site will show the user information about the
   Administrative Record and Information Repository and will also provide
   help while maneuvering through the system.

   Current Documents

   All documents created in the last 90 days will be displayed. You may
   then choose to display documents created 90 days prior.

   Select All for Date Range

   A starting month and year, and ending month and year may be selected,
   and documents will be displayed in chronological order, 100 at a time.

   Select All for Author

   A listing of authors will be provided. Select the author whose
   documents you would like to view; documents will then be listed.

   Select All for Title/Key Word

   A listing of key words will be provided. The user may choose either a
   word or a phrase from the list provided; a list of documents will then
   be displayed with the selected word or phrase in the document title,
   with the most recently created documents first.

   Select All for Waste Area Group

   A listing of WAG titles and descriptions is displayed. You may choose
   the WAG documents you wish to see; they will then be displayed in
   descending chronological order.

   Select All for Operable Unit

   A listing of OU titles and descriptions, including site codes, is
   provided. The user may select an OU to view document titles; the titles
   will be displayed in descending chronological order.

   Select All for File Category

   This sorting option lists the index of the Administrative Record by
   File Category, allowing you to select the type of documents you wish to
   view, i.e., Proposed Plans, Remedial Investigations, Remedial Designs,
   etc. Once the document category is selected, documents falling within
   the category will be listed with the most recent publication appearing
   first.

   The file categories listed are aligned with the Information Repository
   and Administrative Record document index/directory.

   Search Within General INEEL Documents

   This sorting option allows you to search for documents that are not
   WAG- or OU-specific. When selecting this option, you will be provided
   with a screen that narrows your search to Author, Title/Key Word, File
   Category, and General INEEL Documents, Sorted by Date. Each selection
   has a limited choice of options for further viewing.

   Additional Information

   When pressed, the following keys are used for screen manipulation:

      Key                                    Result
 <Back>         Exit the current screen and return to the previous screen
 <Forward>      Return to previous screen
 <Home>         Return to your Home Page
 <Print Button> Print document
 <Find>         Keyword search after <Current Documents> or <Specific Documents>
                or <All Documents> are selected

   The hourglass symbol replaces the arrow on the screen when the request
   is being processed. Please wait until the request is completely
   processed before pressing another key. When the process is complete,
   the arrow symbol will reappear indicating the user can proceed.

   To STOP a current request from completing the process, press the STOP
   button.

   How the computer system counts page numbers of a document may be
   confusing. The Information Repository and Administrative Record
   database system counts the number of pages in the document and does not
   consider the document's pagination or page numbering sequence. For
   example, a document may contain 200 pages in total. The database will
   count 200 pages for that particular document and will not consider the
   pagination sequence unique to the document; i.e., the pagination
   sequence may begin each section of the document with page number one
   (1), it may identify the appendices with an alpha character, or the
   Table of Contents may be numbered with roman numerals. Should the user
   select page 10, the tenth page of the document would be viewed,
   possibly being page ix of the document.

                                  ACRONYMS

   This is a standard Environmental Restoration Program acronyms list and
   is provided for general reference. Documents in this system may or may
   not include these acronyms.
