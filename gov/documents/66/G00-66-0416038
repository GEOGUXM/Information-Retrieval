                             APPLE CULTIVAR EVALUATION

                              NE-183 REGIONAL PROJECT

                Multidisciplinary Evaluation of New Apple Cultivars

                   Performance of Several Apple Cultivars Grown
   in The Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia

   Interest in new apple cultivars has increased among fruit growers and
   consumers during the last decade. Selecting the right cultivar to plant
   is one of the most important decisions for a grower. To make this
   decision, growers need reliable performance data developed from
   replicated trials. Consumers are interested in a more diverse selection
   of high quality apples and are seeking information on apple flavor and
   keeping quality.

   Until recently, systematic evaluation of new apple cultivars was
   limited. Performance of new varieties and selections often depended on
   the plant breeder and a few test sites or observations by growers
   and/or nursery personnel in the field. A regional project (NE-183) was
   initiated in 1994, involving 26 cooperators located in 18 states and
   two Canadian provinces, to systematically evaluate the performance of
   new apple cultivars in replicated trials under a wide range of climatic
   and edaphic conditions. The Appalachian Fruit Research Station (AFRS),
   as a cooperator in this project, has two plantings, one dedicated to
   horticultural evaluations and one for use in evaluating pest
   susceptibility. Cooperators from the West Virginia University
   Kearneysville Tree Fruit Research and Education Center provide
   expertise in pathology and entomology to the local study.

   Twenty-three cultivars on M.9 337 rootstock were planted in 1995 with
   five trees of each cultivar (bud failures in the nursery reduced the
   number of some cultivars to fewer than 5 trees). Trees were planted in
   replicated plots in north-south oriented rows and initially trained to
   the central leader form. Minimal pruning was employed after year one.
   All bloom was removed in the first season (1995). In 1996, only a
   limited number of fruit was allowed to remain on the tree, if present.
   Trees were allowed to fruit beginning in the third (1997) season and
   thereafter. Crop load was adjusted by hand to space fruit about 15 cm
   apart. Commercial recommendations were followed for all cultural
   practices.

   It should be emphasized that growing conditions (weather, soil, etc.)
   affect the performance, appearance, and quality of apples.  This report
   describes performance and characteristics exhibited by apple cultivars
   grown at Kearneysville, WV.  The same cultivar grown in another area
   may respond differently.  Opinions regarding specific cultivars, as
   described here, are subject to change as experience is gained and new
   information is developed.  Horticultural, disease, and fruit quality
   information in this publication is based on 3 to 5 years data;
   information on insect susceptibility represents data collected during
   the 2000 season only.

   Following are the apple cultivars used in this project:

   Arlet   Braeburn   Cameo   Creston   Enterprise   Fortune

   Fuji Red Sport #2   Gala Supreme   Ginger Gold   Golden Supreme

   GoldRush   Honeycrisp   NY75414-1   Orin   Pristine   Sansa   Senshu

   Shizuka   Suncrisp   Sunrise   Yataka
