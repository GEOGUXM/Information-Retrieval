   Road Signs - Buttons and Icons

      Most of the pages within the site use a similar button style and
      location, we also have tried to maintain consistency in their
      functionality throughout.Most pages contain a BACK button, which will
      take the user one page back toward the main entry point of the GPO home
      page.
      [ BACK ]
      Most pages also contain a GPO HOME button which will take the user back
      to the main entry point of the GPO home page.
      [ GPO HOME ]
      Those pages within the Superintendent of Documents area also contain a
      DOCS HOME button, which will return the user to the main Documents
      menu.
      [ DOCS HOME ]
      To aid navigation within large multi-page documents, a Table of
      Contents page can be accessed by clicking the Contents button.
      [ CONTENTS ]
      These large documents may also contain a Next button, to continue to
      the next topic.
      [ NEXT ]
      We hope the consistent use of these buttons will help to orient the
      user, and minimize the number of those "lost in cyberspace".

FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

   Question: I understand that GPO now provides free access to an online
   Federal Register. How do I access it?

   Answer: GPO has placed the Federal Register (from 1994 to date) on the
   Internet using WAIS and WWW servers and is now making it available to
   the public free of any access charges.

    1. Enter the URL: http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/aces/aaces002.html
    2. Click on the Federal Register publication of your choice.
    3. If you wish to ascertain the contents of a particular issue, scroll
       to search field and enter date of choice e.g., date=1/31/96 AND
       contents.
    4. Click on SUBMIT.
    5. Select document of choice for downloading.
    6. Helpful hints for searching the database can be found at:
       http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/aces/desc004.html

   Question: I can't seem to find CFRs at your site. Are they available?

   Answer: GPO has just begun a pilot project with the National Archives
   and Records Administration's Office of the Federal Register which is
   expected to culminate in placement of the entire Code of Federal
   Regulations (CFRs) online.

   It will utilize a newly-acquired SGML-based build/search/retrieve
   software system which is expected to provide superior contextual search
   capabilities. It will also incorporate online revision capabilities
   which will result in a CFR database which is made current on a daily
   basis.

   Until this system is operational GPO will provide incremental access to
   selected CFRs via its WAIS Server at
   http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/index.html
