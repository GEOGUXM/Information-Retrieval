    historic first step to addressing long-neglected energy challenges.
    Given our growing economy and rising standard of living we are faced
    with an energy crisis. The Presidents National Energy Plan balances
    Americas supply needs through technology, diversity of supply and
    conservation and paves the way for Americas energy future."
