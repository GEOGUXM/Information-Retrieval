   Opportunities for liaisons between ICCVAM and non-governmental
   organizations are available.  ICCVAM and NICEATM look forward to
   establishing joint efforts with institutions both private and public.
   Such cooperation should center around co-sponsorships of workshops and
   assistance in underwriting test method reviews.

   NICEATM and ICCVAM pay close attention to other organizations and web
   sites that share similar interests both in the U.S. and abroad.
