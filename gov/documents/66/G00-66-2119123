   An equal opportunity employer to all regardless of race, color, creed,
    national origin, ancestry, sex, marital status, disability, religious
            or political affiliation, age, or sexual orientation.
    It is an objective of the State of California to achieve a drug-free
   state workplace. Any applicant for state employment will be expected to
     behave in accordance with this objective because the use of illegal
    drugs is inconsistent with the law of the state, the rules governing
       civil service, and the special trust placed in public servants.
