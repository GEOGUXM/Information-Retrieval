      The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF)
      enforces the laws that regulate logging on privately-owned lands in
      California. These laws are found in the Forest Practice Act which was
      enacted in 1973 to ensure that logging was done in a manner that would
      preserve our fish, wildlife, forests, streams and other water sources
      forever. Additional rules enacted by the State Board of Forestry and
      Fire Protection are also enforced to protect these resources.

      CDF ensures that private landowners abide by these laws when harvesting
      trees. Although there are specific exemptions in some cases, compliance
      with the Forest Practice Act and Board rules apply to all commercial
      harvesting operations for landowners of small parcels, to ranchers
      owning hundreds or acres, and large timber companies with thousands of
      acres.

      The Timber Harvesting Plan (THP) is the blueprint submitted by a
      landowner to CDF outlining what timber they want to harvest, how it
      will be harvested, and the steps that will be taken to prevent damage
      to the environment. THPs are prepared by Registered Professional
      Foresters (RPFs) who are licensed to prepare these complicated,
      detailed plans. THPs can range from about 100 pages to more than 500
      pages.

      CDF does not have the authority to deny a THP that is in compliance
      with state and federal rules and laws, simply because the logging plan
      is unpopular with the public. The Department reviews and approves
      approximately 1,200 THPs each year. A THP that does not comply with all
      forestry and environmental regulations is returned to the RPF. It is
      only approved after the RPF and landowner agree to make the changes
      necessary to ensure compliance with all laws. CDF follows-up on
      approved THPs with site inspections and can shutdown operations, cite
      or fine Registered Professional Foresters, Licensed Timber Operators
      (LTOs), and landowners if illegal operations are found.
