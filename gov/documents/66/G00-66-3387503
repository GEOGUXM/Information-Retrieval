   Absolute

      Manufacturer Overview

      Absolute Software Corporation (http://www.computrace.com/) provides
      managed services for computer security and tracking. Founded in 1993,
      Absolute is headquartered in Vancouver, BC.

      Product Overview

      ComputracePlus helps organizations deter theft, investigate loss and
      track and recover Wintel computers.

      Product Audience

      IT Professionals who wish to securely track mobile and desktop PCs.

      Product Description

      ComputracePlus is powered by Absolute's Computrace technology platform,
      which is comprised of the secure, patented Computrace Agent and the
      Absolute Monitoring Center.

      The Agent is a stealthy, low-level software client that resides on the
      hard drive of host PCs. The Agent tracks PCs (remote, mobile and
      desktop) with no user intervention; all it needs to locate a stolen PC
      is an Internet or phone connection.

      Once installed, the Agent automatically contacts the Absolute
      Monitoring Center on a regular basis transmitting IP address, phone
      number and additional auto-discovered data points. All data is kept in
      a secure central repository at Absolute Software and can be accessed
      24x7 by authorized administrators.

      ComputracePlus has the following capabilities:
        * Deters Theft. ComputracePlus can instantly decrease internal theft
          rates by publicizing to employees that a "tracking device" is
          installed on all PCs.
        * Investigate Loss. ComputracePlus provides notification when devices
          change hands or are "drifting" from department to department, to
          contractors, to home offices, or to unauthorized third parties.
          ComputracePlus also uncovers internal thieves, accomplices and
          full-blown theft rings and track thieves along with stolen PCs.
        * Locate Stolen Computers. ComputracePlus recovers your hardware
          investment by letting the Absolute Recovery Team coordinate with
          law enforcement to attempt to track and retrieve stolen computers.

      Acquisition

      In order to receive discounted pricing, ComputracePlus must be
