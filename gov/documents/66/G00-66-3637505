   This colorized picture is a mosaic of ultraviolet images from the
   orbiting TRACE satellite sensitive to light emitted by highly charged
   iron atoms. Growing in number, the intricate structures visible are the
   Sun's hot active regions with temperatures over a million degrees
   Fahrenheit and their associated magnetic loops.
