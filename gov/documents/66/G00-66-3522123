                       New Hampshire Soils Information


     Reading and assessing the land is the first step in solving natural
   resource problems and sustaining our limited resources.  In particular,
    soils provide the foundation for conservation work, and understanding
       the nature and properties of soils is critical to managing and
                     conserving other natural resources.

     The New Hampshire Soils Program is a diverse and customer-sensitive
    program that strives to set a national example while serving the soil
               information needs of New Hampshire communities.
