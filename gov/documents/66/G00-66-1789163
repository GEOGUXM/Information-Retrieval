                 FAST FACTS:   MAIL SAFETY

   I have been receiving many inquiries from Idahoans who are concerned
   about handling their mail at home and at work.  This is a list of what
   kinds of measures are being taken by the government to make mail
   handling safe for postal workers and what kinds of precautions you can
   take when opening your mail.

   Mail Sanitization and Safety Measures

     *

   Specifically, the USPS has announced a three-tier approach for mail
   sanitization.
   1. Immediate steps: Using available off-site facilities to
   decontaminate mail.
   2. Short-term steps: Identifying key postal locations for the
   centralized processing and decontamination of mail.
   3. Long-term steps: Identifying and building into existing processes
   equipment that is completely safe for employees and customers.
     *

   The USPS is sending 145 million postcards to all households throughout
   the country explaining how to safely handle suspicious mail and has
   produced a video addressing mailroom security and has distributed it to
   15,000 business customers.
     *

   In the meantime, the USPS advises all Americans to wash their hands
   after handling mail.
     *

   The White House has authorized $175 million for the U.S. Postal Service
   (USPS) to purchase masks and gloves for postal employees and
   electron-beam equipment to kill any biological agents inside or outside
   mail items.
     *

   The USPS Board of Governors has unanimously authorized an additional
   expenditure of at least $200 million to purchase or lease this
   state-of-the-art electron-beam technology.  The USPS is also using
   these funds to purchase new sanitization equipment to kill any
   biological agents in mail separated by targeted screening.  For
   security reasons, specific details about the type of equipment used or
   the location of the equipment will not be released.
     *

   Research is being conducted to ensure that technology used by the
   sanitizing equipment will not cause other problems by damaging
   sensitive material such as film, videotape, or food.  This technology
   has already been put to successful use in the food and medical services
   industries.

                       Ongoing Anthrax Investigations


     *

   As of October 25, postal inspectors are prosecuting seven individuals
   for anthrax-related hoaxes and are investigating an additional six to
   ten hoax cases.
     *

   The USPS is offering a reward of up to $1 million for information
   leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone who mailed a letter
   containing anthrax.
     *

   The USPS, with the assistance of the Centers for Disease Control and
   the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continue to test postal facilities
   throughout the country.
