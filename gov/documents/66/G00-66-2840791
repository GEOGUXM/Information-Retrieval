Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act

General

   The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA),
   prohibits discrimination against persons because of their service in
   the Armed Forces Reserve, the National Guard, or other uniformed
   services. USERRA prohibits an employer from denying any benefit of
   employment on the basis of an individuals membership, application for
   membership, performance of service, application for service, or
   obligation for service in the uniformed services. USERRA also protects
   the right of veterans, reservists, National Guard members, and certain
   other members of the uniformed services to reclaim their civilian
   employment after being absent due to military service or training.

   USERRA authorizes OSC to investigate alleged violations of the act by
   federal executive agencies,  and to prosecute meritorious claims before
   the Merit Systems Protection Board on behalf of the aggrieved person.

   Ref:  38 U.S.C. § 4301, et. seq.

Filing a USERRA Complaint with OSC

   OSC is not authorized to receive a USERRA complaint directly from the
   claimant. Instead, the claimant must first file his/her complaint with
   the Department of Labor's Veterans' Employment and Training Service
   (VETS). If VETS is unsuccessful in resolving the complaint, the
   claimant may request that VETS refer the complaint to OSC. If the
   Special Counsel believes there is merit to the complaint, OSC will
   initiate an action before the Merit Systems Protection Board and appear
   on behalf of the claimant. The successful claimant is entitled to
   receive the employment benefits that he/she was denied as the result of
   the agency's violation of USERRA. Additionally, a prevailing claimant
   is entitled to attorney's fees, expert witness fees, and other
   litigation expenses.
