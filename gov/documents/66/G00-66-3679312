   Cancer Trials   Experimental and Investigational Treatment
   Do you or a friend or a relative have cancer?
   Information on clinical trials of new treatments is available from the
   National Cancer Institute at http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov.
     If your health plan has denied treatment that your doctor has
   recommended because the treatment is considered experimental or
   investigational, you may be able to have the denial reviewed by
   independent medical experts.
   (You must meet certain requirements to be eligible.)
   For more information, call the DMHC toll-free number at (888) HMO-2219
   or TDD (877) 688-9891.
