     Q. When I logon to Web Pacer the left part of my browser window is
     blank, what is wrong?

     A. To use Web PACER, your browser must have java script enabled.
     Goto the Edit menu, then select Preferences. Click the Advanced
     category. Be sure the checkboxes for Enable Java and Enable
     JavaScript are checked.
