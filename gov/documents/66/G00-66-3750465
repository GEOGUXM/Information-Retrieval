               President Creates Fund To Help Afghan Children

   President George W. Bush has created a special fund to help the
   children of Afghanistan. Many of the children in Afghanistan are
   orphans and do not have enough to eat. The President is asking children
   to send $1 - or whatever they can - to the special America's Fund for
   Afghan Children. The contributions should be mailed to:

   America's Fund for Afghan Children
   c/o The White House
   1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
   Washington, D.C. 20509-1600

   The White House will send the donation to the American Red Cross, to
   spend on programs that will directly help the children of Afghanistan,
   including those children who are now refugees in other countries. Every
   dollar contributed will go directly to aid, including food, medicine
   and shelter.

   Many kids have asked how they can help following the terrorist attacks
   of Sept. 11th - now the President gave the answer!
