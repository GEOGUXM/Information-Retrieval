   Washington, DC 20024 Report #35 October 31, 2001 Reporting Period: 1
   July  30 September 2001 Submitted by William J. Hughes Technical Center
   NSTB/WAAS T&E Team ACT 360 Atlantic City International Airport, NJ
   08405 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The GPS Product Team (AND 730) has tasked the
   Navigation Branch (ACT 360) at the William J. Hughes Technical Center
   to document Global Positioning System (GPS) Standard Positioning
   Service (SPS) performance in quarterly GPS Performance Analysis (PAN)
   Reports. The report contains the analysis performed on data collected
   at the following NSTB and Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)
   Reference Station locations: Anderson, Atlantic City, Columbus, Denver,
   Elko, Great Falls, Atlantic City (FVS), Bangor (FVS), Kansas City
   (WAAS), Salt Lake City (WAAS), Miami (WAAS) and Atlanta (WAAS). This
   analysis verifies the GPS SPS performance as compared to the
   performance parameters stated in the SPS Specification Annex A. This
   report, Report #35, includes data collected from 1 July through 30
   September 2001. The next quarterly report will be issued 31 January
   2002. Analysis of this data includes the following categories: Coverage
   performance, Service Availability Performance, Position Performance,
   Range Performance, Solar Storm Effects on GPS SPS performance,
   GPS/GLONASS performance and WAAS performance. Coverage performance was
   based on Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP). Utilizing the weekly
   almanac posted on the US Coast Guard navigation web site, the coverage
   for every 5o grid point between 180W to 180E and 80S and 80N was
   calculated for every minute over a 24-hour period for each of the weeks
   covered in the reporting period. For this reporting period, the
   coverage based on PDOP less than six for the CONUS was 99.9% or better.
   Availability was verified by reviewing the "Notice: Advisory to Navstar
   Users" (NANU) reports issued between 1 July and 30 September 2001 and
   by calculating the satellite availability from the data obtained from
   the nine sites. A total of sixteen outages were reported in the NANU's.
   Eleven of the outages were scheduled and five were unscheduled. The
   quarterly availabilities for Anderson, Atlantic City, Columbus, Denver,
   Elko, Grand Forks, Great Falls, Atlantic City (FVS), Bangor (FVS),
   Atlanta, Kansas City, Salt Lake City and Miami were 100%, 99.989%,
   99.997%, 99.994%, 100%, 99.999%, 100%, 100%, 99.999%, 99.999%, 99.993%,
   99.997% and 99.974% respectively. Each of these availabilities is
   within the SPS value of 99.85%. In this quarter, SPS specifications
   were exceeded. These availability percentages were calculated using DOP
   data collected at one-second intervals. The statistics on the days of
   significant solar activity met all GPS Standard Positioning Service
   (SPS) specifications. Position accuracies were verified by calculating
   the 95% and 99.99% values of horizontal and vertical errors. Due to the
   failure of PRN22 on 28 July 2001, the 99.99% values for all sites
   tracking the satellite at the time of failure have been severely
   affected. Both the vertical and horizontal 95% values failed for the
   day of the PRN22 failure (28 July 2001). This problem is addressed
   further in the problem section of this report. Range performance was
   verified for each satellite using the data collected from the NSTB
   Anderson site. The data was collected in one-second samples. All of the
   satellites met the range error specifications except for PRN22 on 28
   July 2001. This is addressed separately in the problem section of this
   report. The maximum range error recorded was 22.377 meters on Satellite
   PRN 9. The SPS specification states that the range error should never
   exceed 150 meters. The maximum range rate error recorded was 0.74953
   Meters/second on Satellite PRN 9. The SPS specification states that the
   range rate error should never exceed 2 meters/second. The maximum range
   acceleration error recorded was 7.50 Millimeters/second2 on Satellite
   PRN 9. The SPS specification states that the range acceleration error
   should never exceed 19 Millimeters/second2. A GLONASS/GPS performance
   section was added to the PAN report. In April 1999, ACT-360 was tasked
   to monitor, analyze and characterize GLONASS and GPS/GLONASS system
   performance. The objective of this task is to evaluate the ability of
   GLONASS to provide navigation by itself and with SPS GPS and to assess
   the incremental benefit to WAAS obtained from using GLONASS. A
   GPS/GLONASS receiver was used in the NSTB laboratory at the FAA
   Technical Center. The GPS/GLONASS performance (from an Ashtech GG24)
   was compared against GPS-only performance (collected from a Novatel
   receiver). The 95% horizontal error and vertical error for the
   GPS/GLONASS solution were 4.785 Meters and 8.893 Meters, respectively.
   From the analysis performed on data collected between 1 July and 30
   September 2001, the GPS performance did not meet all SPS requirements
   that were evaluated. Please view the problem section of this report for
   a further explanation of the problems that occurred this quarter. FAA

   35 iii GPS SPS Performance Analysis Report October 31, 2001 1.0
   Introduction 1.1 Objective of GPS SPS Performance Analysis Report In
   1993, the FAA began monitoring and analyzing Global Positioning System
   (GPS) Standard Positioning Service (SPS) performance data. At present,
   the FAA has approved GPS for IFR and is developing Wide Area
   Augmentation System (WAAS) and Local Area Augmentation (LAAS), both of
   which are GPS augmentation systems. In order to ensure the safe and
   effective use of GPS and its augmentation systems within the NAS, it is
   critical that characteristics of GPS performance as well as specific
   causes for service outages be monitored and understood. To accomplish
   this objective, GPS SPS performance data is documented in a quarterly
   GPS Analysis report. This report contains data collected at the
   following National Satellite Test Bed (NSTB) and WAAS reference station
   locations: Anderson, SC Atlantic City, NJ (FVS) Atlantic City, NJ
   Bangor, ME (FVS) Columbus, NE Kansas City, KS Denver, CO Salt Lake
   City, UT Elko, NV Miami, FL Grand Forks, ND Atlanta, GA Great Falls, MT
   (Future reports will include all WAAS sites but a database that can
   handle all that data needs to be developed. ACT-360 is in the process
   of setting up an Oracle database for this purpose.) The analysis of the
   data is divided into the four performance categories stated in the
   Standard Positioning Service Performance Specification (SPS) Annex A
   (June 2, 1995). These categories are: Coverage Performance Satellite
   Availability Performance Service Reliability Standard Positioning,
   Ranging and Timing Accuracy Standard. The results were then compared to
   the performance parameters stated in the SPS. 1.2 Summary of
   Performance Requirements and Metrics Table 1-1 lists the performance
   parameters from the SPS and identifies those parameters verified in
   this report. Appendix E Table 1.2 contains the performance parameters
   evaluated for the WAAS in this report. 1.3 Report Overview Section 2 of
   this report summarizes the results obtained from the coverage
   calculation program called SPS_CoverageArea developed by ACT-360. The
   SPS_CoverageArea program uses the GPS satellite almanacs to compute
   each satellite position as a function of time for a selected day of the
   week. This program establishes a 5-degree grid between 180 degrees east
   and 180 degrees west, and from 80 degrees north and 80 degrees south.
   The program then computes the PDOP at each grid point (1485 total grid
   points) every minute for the entire day and stores the results. After
   the PDOP's have been saved the 99.99% index of 1-minute PDOP at each
   grid point is determined and plotted as contour lines (Figure 2-1). The
   program also saves the number of satellites used in PDOP calculation at
   each grid point for analysis. Report 35 1 GPS SPS Performance Analysis
   Report October 31, 2001 Section 3 summarizes the GPS availability
   performance by providing the "Notice: Advisory to Navstar Users" (NANU)
   messages to calculate the total time of forecasted and actual satellite
   outages. This section also includes the maximum and minimum of the
   PDOP, HDOP and VDOP for each of the thirteen NSTB/WAAS sites. Section 4
   summarizes service reliability performance. It will be reported at the
   end of the first year of this analysis because the SPS standard is
   based a measurement interval of one year. Data for the quarter is
   provided for completeness. Section 5 provides the position and
   repeatable accuracies based on data collected on a daily basis at one-
   second intervals. This section also provides the statistics on the
   range error, range error rate and range acceleration error for each
   satellite. The overall average, maximum, minimum and standard
   deviations of the range rates and accelerations are tabulated for each
   satellite. In Section 6, the data collected during solar storms is
   analyzed to determine the effects, if any, of GPS SPS performance.
   Section 7 provides the analysis on GPS/GLONASS performance. A
   GPS/GLONASS receiver was used in the NSTB laboratory at the FAA
   Technical Center. Appendix A provides a summary of all the results as
   compared to the SPS specification. Appendix B provides the geomagnetic
   data used for Section 6. Appendix C provides a PAN Problem Report. The
   SPS specification was not met in several instances during the entire
   quarter due to the failure of PRN22 on 28 July 2001. Appendix D
   provides a glossary of terms used in this PAN report. This glossary was
   obtained directly from the GPS SPS specification document. Appendix E
   provides the WAAS performance analysis report. Report 35 2 GPS SPS

   used for this coverage portion of the report were obtained from the
   Coast Guard web site (www.navcen.uscg.mil). Using these almanacs, an
   SPS coverage area program developed by ACT-360 was used to calculate
   the PDOP at every 5o point between longitudes of 180W to 180E and 80S
   and 80N at one-minute intervals. This gives a total of 1440 samples for
   each of the 2376 grid points in the coverage area. Table 2-1 provides
   the global averages and worst-case availability over a 24-hour period
   for each week. Table 2-1 also gives the global 99.9% PDOP value for
   each of the thirteen GPS Weeks. The PDOP was 3.866 or better 99.9% for
   each of the 24-hour intervals. The GPS coverage performance evaluated
   met the specifications stated in the SPS. Report 35 5 GPS SPS

   Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability (RMA) data is being
   collected based on published "Notice: Advisory to Navstar Users"
   messages (NANU's). This data has been summarized in Table 3-4. The
   "Total Satellite Observed MTTR" was calculated by taking the average
   downtime of all satellite outage occurrences. Schedule downtime was
   forecasted in advance via NANU's. All other downtime reported via NANU
   was considered unscheduled. The "Percent Operational" was calculated
   based on the ratio of total actual operating hours to total available
   operating hours for every satellite. Table 3-4 GPS Block II/IIA

   respectively. Table 3-6 shows the PDOP statistics for the worst-case
   point on the worst-case day. NOTE: Global in this report refers to the
   nine sites used. Although future reports will have all WAAS sites, a
   true global availability cannot be determined since there aren't
   reference stations around the world. Whenever the PDOP goes above six
   and an SPS requirement is not met, an investigation is performed to
   determine what caused the PDOP to go above six. The following is a list
   of programs/procedures used during times of high PDOP: Notice of
   Advisory to Navstar Users (NANU's) messages are used to verify that
   satellite outages did occur. (See Section 3.1 for more details about
   NANU's for this quarter.) Report 35 10 GPS SPS Performance Analysis
   Report October 31, 2001 A satellite outage detection program developed
   by ACT-360 verifies satellite outages that are not verified through a
   NANU. For example, a satellite outage can occur for just a few seconds
   during an upload. This satellite detection program monitors all the
   receivers and keeps track of what satellites the receiver should be
   tracking versus what satellites the receiver is actually tracking. At
   least six receivers need to be tracking the satellite prior to the
   outage and no receiver can be tracking the satellite for the program to
   detect an outage. This program is also being enhanced so that false
   locks and late ephemeris problems can also be detected. This program
   will also output flags from the receivers so that problems with the
   receiver or TRS software, if any, can be tracked more easily. Data from
   co-located receivers is analyzed for times that the PDOP goes above
   six. This helps in determining whether the problem is due to the
   environment. The instance of worst performance where the PDOP went
   above six is reported in Table 3-6. The column labeled "NANU/SOD"
   reports whether the outage was detected via a NANU or the Satellite
   Outage Detection (SOD) program along with the Satellite PRN number that
   had the outage. Table 3-6 Maximum PDOP Statistics Site GPS Week/ Max

   July and 30 September 2001 was down loaded from USNO Internet site. The
   USNO data file contains the time difference between the USNO master
   clock and GPS system time for each GPS satellites during the time
   period. Over 10,000 samples of GPS time error are contained in the USNO
   data file. In order to evaluate the GPS time transfer error, the data
   file was used to create a histogram (Fig 5-3) to represent the
   distribution of GPS time error. The histogram was created by taking the
   absolute value of time difference between the USNO master clock and GPS
   system time, then creating data bins with one nanosecond precision. The
   number of samples in each bin was then plotted to form the histogram in
   Fig 5-3. The mean, standard deviation, and 95% index are within the
   requirements of GPS SPS time error. Report 35 16 GPS SPS Performance
