                     Global Grid Forum Performance Area

   * Steering Committee
   * Working Groups
   * GGF4 BOFs New!
    - Grid Benchmarking
    - Sensor Management
   The Performance Area is an administrative division of the Global Grid
   Forum working groups that will tend to contain working groups that are
   primarily concerned with system, application, and network performance
   and monitoring issues.

Steering Committee

     * Ruth Aydt - <aydt@cs.uiuc.edu>
     * (to be named)

Working Groups

     * Grid Monitoring Architecture Working Group (GMA-WG)
        - This was the previous "main" performance working group. The
            charters and goals, etc. are out of date, but archived
            information such as talks, meeting minutes, etc. are all
            there.
     * Network Measurements Working Group (NM-WG)
        - The Network Measurements Working Group (NMWG) identifies and
            characterizes metrics useful to grid applications and
            middleware, and develops standards to ensure the compatibility
            of metrics across measurement systems and applications.

GGF4 Birds of a Feather (BOF) Sessions

     * Grid Benchmarking BOF

        Charter
                Grid Benchmarking Working/Research Group Provisional
                Charter

                As Grid Computing Environments are getting pervasive, it
                is becoming clear that objective tests must be devised to
                rate their functionality and efficiency. A number of such
                testing tools are already available, but these usually
                take the form of simulations of idealized Grid
                Environments, or lower-level performance rating tools.
                Either way, they are typically standalone products that do
                not specify a standard workload against which Grid
                performance should be rated.

                We propose to put together a set of tasks that assesses
                Grid performance at the level of user applications. The
                tasks should be specified as paper-and-pencil benchmarks
                that can be implemented using any of the existing and
                future Grid Environments. They should be representative of
                the kinds of computations that are naturally suited for
                Grid environments.

        Proposed agenda items
                Some initial work in Grid benchmarking has been done in
                the NAS Grid Benchmarking Project (there was a
                presentation at GGF3, and a paper at HPDC in San Francisco
                in August 2001), but a lot of issues are still to be
                determined.

               o True Grid benchmarks should test data processing as well
                 as data transfer properties of the environment. Some
                 rules of thumb should be developed--with the input from
                 networking experts and visionaries--to specify tasks that
                 will test both for a wide range of distributed systems.
               o Wise scale-up rules should be developed for designing
                 larger problem classes that can carry Grid benchmarks
                 into the future.
               o Should Grid benchmarks specify security, fault tolerance,
                 authentication? If so, how?
               o How should Grid Benchmarks present results? Should the
                 resources used be listed?
               o Is there a need for a Grid benchmarking suite for
                 developers of Grid Environments (as opposed to users
                 thereof), and, if so, should it be drawn up from scratch,
                 or can it be composed of elements of user-level
                 benchmarks.

     * Sensor Management BOF
       A BOF will be held at GGF4 to discuss the formation of a Sensor
       Management (or Sensor) Working Group in the Performance Area.

        Motivation
                Previous discussions at GGF2, GGF3, and on the Performance
                Mailing list identified an interest in developing a
                repository of downloadable sensor code, in defining the
                relationship between sensors and Grid Monitoring
                Architecture (GMA) producers, and in defining a
                minimum-criteria standard for a sensor that is to be used
                for grid-related applications.

        People
                Tom Roney (troney@ncsa.uiuc.edu) will lead the BOF, and is
                looking for someone to co-chair the WG, if the interest
                and commitment level expressed at the BOF is sufficent to
                form a WG. Brian Tierney (bltierney@lbl.gov) will assist
                in running the BOF, but is not interested in co-chairing
                the WG.

        Charter, etc.
                More details about the proposed WG, including a draft
                Charter and Milestones, which will form the basis of the
                discussion at the BOF, will be posted to the Perf Area
                mailing list and web page prior to GGF4.
