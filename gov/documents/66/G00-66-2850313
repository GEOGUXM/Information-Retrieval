                   Safe Skies for Africa Initiative
  The goal of this Presidential initiative is to promote sustainable
 improvements in aviation safety and security in Africa, and to create
 the environment necessary to foster the growth of air transportation
between Africa and the United States. We believe that safe skies are a
prerequisite for increased trade and investment and long-term economic
   development in Africa. The initiative complements U.S. Government
efforts to conclude "open skies" agreements with key African countries
 and promote code-share agreements between U.S. and African airlines.
