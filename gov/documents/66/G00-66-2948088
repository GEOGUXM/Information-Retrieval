      Board, electing two of its three members. For 2001, the FTB is chaired
      by the State Controller, Kathleen Connell. Other board members include
      John Chiang, chairman of the Board of Equalization and Timothy Gage,
      director of the Department of Finance.

      Kathleen Connell - Picture Kathleen Connell, State Controller

      Kathleen Connell was elected California's Controller in 1994, bringing
      with her a strong background in business, education and finance.

      As the state's chief financial officer, Connell is a Citizen Politician
      who takes seriously her role as fiscal watchdog for California
      taxpayers. In addition to disbursing state funds and sitting on more
      than 50 policy-making boards and commissions, Connell has undertaken
      aggressive audits that have to date uncovered nearly half a billion
      dollars of waste, fraud and inefficiencies in state government.

      Such audits are within the Controller's constitutional role, but
      Connell has brought new vigor and a taxpayer-oriented activism to the
      office, shining the light of day on departments that have never
      received serious fiscal scrutiny.

      But Kathleen Connell is much more than a "bean counter." She is
      passionate about cutting waste and improving efficiency because she
      thinks it's time to Get REAL about California's future -- in education
      for our children, for example, and in revitalizing the state's
      infrastructure to enhance economic growth and job creation.

      As the State's Chief Financial Officer, the Controller also serves on
      over 50 boards and commissions. The Controller is the chairperson of
      the Franchise Tax Board which administers the Personal Income Tax and
      Bank and Corporation Tax programs. The Controller is a member of the
      Board of Equalization, which collects the Sales, Highway User's,
      Alcoholic Beverage, and Cigarette Taxes. Additionally, the Controller
      is a member of the State Board of Control which considers and settles
      claims against the State and administers the Victims of Crime Program
      and other mandates to county government.

      The Controller is one of three members of the State Lands Commission,
      the agency which regulates use of more than four million acres of state
      land and waterways. The Commission is responsible for administering the
      public trusts in these lands, including the onshore and offshore
      mineral extraction programs which are an important source of state
      revenues.

      Prior to being elected Controller, Connell ran her own investment
      banking firm and had served as vice president and director for Chemical
      Bank of New York.

      She has a Ph.D from UCLA and taught graduate level courses at the UCLA
      and UC Berkeley business schools. And, she was the founder and director
      of the Center for Finance and Real Estate the UCLA School of
      Management.

      When Dr. Connell is not conducting state business around the state, she
      lives nearby in Los Angeles with her two young sons.

      John Chiang, Chair, Board of Equalization Johan Klehs - Picture

      John Chiang was elected to the California State Board of Equalizations
      Fourth District in 1998. He represents more than 8 million residents of
      Los Angeles County. Chiang began his career as a Tax Law Specialist
      with the Internal Revenue Service in Los Angeles and later served as an
      attorney with the Office of the State Controller.

      Having graduated with honors from the University of South Florida with
      a degree in finance, Chiang later received a law degree from Georgetown
      University Law Center. In California he received the State Bar of
      California Board of Governors Pro Bono Service Award and the California
      Trial Lawyers Association Presidents Award.

      In his capacity as board member, Chiang has promoted public-private
      partnerships through community outreach and taxpayer education. Chiang
      organized the first Board of Equalization, Franchise Tax Board, and
      Internal Revenue Service seminar for nonprofit organizations and joined
      with the Los Angeles County Assessor's Office to hold a tax seminar for
      religious organizations. He also organized business and labor forums on
      fighting tax evasion in the "underground economy."

      Tempore David Roberti, and for three years as a budget analyst with the
