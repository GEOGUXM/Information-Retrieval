   Vadose Zone Transport Studies

Vadose Zone Transport Field Studies

   This web page provides links to Battelle studies in vadose zone
   transport and related subjects.

   The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) through its Hanford Science and
   Technology (S&T) Initiative has funded research to reduce uncertainties
   associated with vadose zone transport processes beneath waste sites at
   DOE's Hanford Site. The Vadose Zone Transport Field Study (VZTFS) is an
   S&T activity with an objective of providing a systematic set of field
   tests to assess contaminant plume migration in the Hanford Vadose zone.
   A second objective is to assess advanced characterization tools for
   vadose-zone plume detection with emphasis on minimally- intrusive
   geophysical tools and those that take advantage of the existing
   infrastructure of steel-cased wells using tomography and related
   methods.

   Vadose Zone Hydrologic Characterization. DOE, through its Office of
   Science and Technology, Subsurface Contamination Focus Area has funded
   research activities related testing and deployment of vadose- zone
   instrumentation. Studies at the Hanford Site include development and
   deployment of advanced tensiometers, water flux meters and other
   vadose-zone instruments (e.g., water content and soil water pressure
   sensors and solution samplers). Activities related to the deployment of
   advanced tensiometers at the Hanford Site and the development and
   deployment of a water-flux meter, for monitoring waste site drainage,
   are described in links on this web page. Examples are also provided of
   active data retrieval for soil-water- balance parameters
   (precipitation, water storage, drainage) from the Hanford 300 N Vadose
   Zone Field Site, where over 20 years of data have been collected.

   In FY 2001, the purpose of the Tank Leak Detection Demonstration (TLDD)
   project is to support system designs for LDMM. Five geophysical
   technologies, previously tested for plume migration (under the VZTFS
   work), have been selected for testing the proof-of-concept for tank
   leaks in the Hanford vadose zone. For more information on the specific
   technologies, test plans, and contractor reports that support the TLDD
   project, please see the TLDD page.
