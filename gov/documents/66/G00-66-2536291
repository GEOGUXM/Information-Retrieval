   Alaska Surface Water Data
        __________________________________________________________________

   Surface Water Retrieval

        * Current Alaska Streamflow Conditions-- via satellite or phone modem
        * Historical Streamflow Data: search for station, search with a map,
          or get a  list of counties (see warning)
        * Request Surface Water data via email
        * National Information on Surface Water
        * Index of Streamflow Data

   Current Surface Water Stations

        The USGS currently maintains about 88 full time stream-gaging
        stations in Alaska and about 40 "partial-record" stations used for
        peak flow data collection. Data for some of these sites are
        available in real-time. Historical surface-water data are available
        in a computerized data base for about 2,600 sites. Streamflow data
        collected by the USGS are used by Federal, State and local
        water-resource managers for fisheries management, flood forecasting,
        and low-flow water availability information, as well as by
        recreational users such as rafters, kayakers, and fishermen. USGS
        surface-water data are used to help design bridges and culverts and
        are used for flood-frequency calculations needed by Federal, State
        and local planners.

   WARNING...

        Historical surface-water data retrieved may not be accurate, due to
        some problems in the computer database. The problem with incorrect
        basin names, elevations, and drainage areas has been corrected.
        Although the problem with incomplete periods of record is greatly
        improved, there are still some problems with it. If you encounter
        any known discrepancies regarding these data, please E-mail
        Surface-Water Specialist.

        To verify information:
       1. Cross-check the information with published reports ("Water
          Resources Data for Alaska--water year 199X: U.S. Geological Survey
          Water-Data Report AK-9X-1, where 199X is the year of interest)
          or
       2. Send email to the Alaska Surface-Water Specialist.
