       What is the IHS Mediation Program?

   The Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Civil Rights Staff
   (OEEO-CRS), Indian Health Service (IHS) and the Departmental Appeals
   Board Mediation Program (Board), Department of Health and Human
   Services have a Memorandum of Understanding for providing mediation
   services during the informal/formal discrimination complaint process.
   Under this agreement, the IHS OEEO-CRS recognizes the Board as the
   agent for the official IHS Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
   process. The Board assigns mediators and supervises the mediation
   process; the OEEO-CRS supervises the complaints process and how
   mediation interfaces with the process.

    What is Mediation?

   Mediation is a process whereby a trained neutral party assists in
   resolving a dispute, or at least narrowing and clarifying issues, in a
   manner that is acceptable to both sides. Mediation is different than
   traditional litigation in that it is informal, the rules of evidence do
   not apply, testimony is not taken, and the mediator does not decide the
   dispute. It is also different from traditional negotiation in that the
   neutral party facilitates the discussions, sometimes with both
   disputants together and sometimes with each side privately.

   The mediator, in effect, creates a new forum where the disputants can
   candidly discuss their concerns. The mediator will not reveal anything
   from private discussions that one side does not want revealed to the
   other. Thus, the mediator often will have more information, and a more
   complete picture of the problem, than either party alone. By virtue of
   this unique position, the mediator can often help identify options for
   agreement that were not evident before. Also, the mediator can help
   assess the strengths and weaknesses of each partyÂ’s case and help
   create realistic expectations.

   Why Request Mediation?

   Disputes often arise out of communication problems or sheer complexity.
   Traditional adjudication sometimes exacerbates disputes, unnecessarily
   solidifies positions, and can result in protracted and costly
   litigation. Mediators are trained in communication and problem-solving
   skills, and a session with a mediator can facilitate a constructive
   exchange of views and develop previously unseen alternatives.

   Mediation allows you to control your dispute and resolve the problem
   yourself, rather than having a judge or some other official decide it
   for you. Mediation is also fast and economical. Even if you do not
   resolve the dispute, mediation frequently clarifies and narrows the
   issues so that litigation proceeds in a more rapid and focused manner.

   People sometimes avoid mediation because they confuse it with
   compromise. Requesting mediation does not mean you wish to compromise.
   It means you are interested in talking in a confidential setting to
   determine whether the problem can be resolved without litigation. You
   retain control. You need not agree to anything that you do not believe
   is in your best interest.

   Will Mediation Speed up Resolving Disputes?

   Yes. It is an informal process to resolve disputes and does not require
   the legal or formal process that can result in administrative
   processing delays. Normally, mediation will be completed in a matter of
   weeks as opposed to possibly months or years. If you reach a
   satisfactory resolution, your agreement will be recorded in a
   Memorandum of Agreement and signed by all parties. If mediation is not
   successful in resolving your complaint, however, you have lost no
   rights. Your complaint will be processed in accordance with 29 CFR Part
   1614.

   Who Are the Mediators?

   Mediators in these cases are attorneys and conflict management
   specialists from the ADR Division of the Board and the EEOC. The ADR
   Division has been mediating disputes for over fifteen years, and its
   staff has had extensive mediation training and has taught mediation
   skills to lawyers, executives, managers, and others throughout the
   United States. In addition, the EEOC provides mediators who can
   contribute EEO expertise to the program. The mediators have special
   mediation training and considerable practical experience.

   What Cases Are Eligible for Mediation?

   Any allegation of employment discrimination in either the informal or
   formal stage is eligible for mediation. Of course, both sides
   (Complainant and the Agency) must agree to mediate.
   [ top ]

   Who Can Initiate Mediation?

   Any IHS employee, supervisor, or manager who is an involved party in
   the EEO pre-complaint (informal) process and/or the EEO formal process
   may request mediation.

   What Happens Once Mediation is Requested?

   Once mediation is requested and both parties involved in the dispute
   agree to mediate, a mediator is assigned to the case. The mediator will
   facilitate the initial conference as well as subsequent sessions as
   needed. Some of the subsequent sessions may be conducted over the
   phone. If an agreement is reached, a Settlement Agreement will be
   drafted and signed by all parties. The EEO complaint will be considered
   withdrawn once a Settlement Agreement is signed by all parties. If an
   agreement is not reached, the complaint will be reinstated in the EEO
   administrative process.

   What About Confidentiality?

   Mediators are strictly prohibited from discussing cases with anyone
   outside of the mediation process. This is designed to assure that no
   one who might be involved in a possible later adjudication will have
   any knowledge of what happened during mediation. Also, nothing from the
   mediation process will be added to the record. The Administrative
   Dispute Resolution Act of 1996 has confidentiality assurances at
   section 574 that apply in IHS mediations.
