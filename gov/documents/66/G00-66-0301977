   Impetus/How Project Began During the past decade with increased
   computing power and new research developments, Bayesian statistical
   methods have become practical in diverse areas of statistical
   applications. Bayesian methods provide a unified framework for
   optimally combining information from multiple sources, resulting in
   simpler and improved statistical analyses. Despite the widespread
   growth in Bayesian methods, for the most the field of metrology has not
   taken advantage of these methods. Both NIST researchers and their
   customers have much to gain from these methods.

   Recognizing the potential, NIST statisticians began exploring the use
   of Bayesian methods in several metrological applications. After some
   initial research, a five year competence initiative on Bayesian
   metrology was started in FY99.
   Objective(s) Research, develop, and apply Bayesian methods to the
   metrological problems of NIST; promulgate results to other metrology
   laboratories and to NIST customers.

   Four specific areas are targeted:
    1. traceability,
    2. interlaboratory comparisons,
    3. calibration, and
    4. part inspection.

   These areas were chosen because of their importance to NIST and their
   potential benefit from Bayesian methods.
   Staffing Profile and Funding FTE = 2.3 (Mathematical Statistician)

   Funding is for $431K STRS (Competence)
   Timeline/
   Milestones The timelines and milestones for this project are:
     * FY99: Complete publication on a Bayesian model for interlaboratory
       comparisons; explore the relationship between the ISO uncertainty
       procedure and Bayesian statistics; present review of Bayesian
       statistics to NIST staff.
     * FY00: Learn applicable theory and methodology for Bayesian
       hierchial model (Gaussian) models, acquire BUGS (Bayesian
       computational software), and apply it to an example of NIST data.
     * FY 01: Apply hierarchical Bayes model to NIST
       examples--Interlaboratory Proficiency Study. Formulate Bayesian
       models for (Gaussian and non-Gaussian) SRM data, for calibration
       data, part inspection plans; construct optimal Bayesian designs for
       calibrations and for prototypical interlaboratory comparison
       experiments.
     * FY 02: Implement Bayesian hierarchical (Gaussian) analytic
       methodology as web-product. Develop Bayesian model for Type "B"
       uncertainty, and develop elicitation methodology and software for
       modeling expert opinion. Define analyses for canonical applications
       and continue to implement Bayesian methodology as web-product in
       parallel to SEMATECH HANDBOOK (for frequentist approach).
     * FY 03: Develop or implement graphical representations of Bayesian
       hierarchical models; Implement Bayesian methodology and incorporate
       into standard NIST statistical practices.
