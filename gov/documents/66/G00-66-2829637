Infrastructure Needed for Cancer Research: NCI's Challenge

   Introduction
   The challenge before NCI is to build and continually enhance a research
   system that will allow the scientific community to apply new
   discoveries and emerging technologies.

   Investigator-Initiated Research
   Goal: To accelerate discoveries and their application by expanding and
   facilitating researcher access to resources and new technologies.

   Centers, Networks, and Consortia
   Goal: To create and sustain research infrastructures for collaboration,
   technology support and development, and access to resources.

   National Clinical Trials Program in Treatment and Prevention
   Goal: To ensure that clinical trials address the most important
   questions in treatment and prevention and are broadly accessible.

     Story of Discovery
     2001 brought an entirely new way of treating one of the cancers of
     the blood Â— by going after the very molecules that lead cells
     astray. But the journey to 2001 was long and difficult and
     instructive. Here it is, step by step.

   Studying Emerging Trends in Cancer
   Goal: To expand cancer surveillance to improve monitoring of progress
   in cancer control and explain potential causes of cancer across all
   populations.

   Quality of Cancer Care
   Goal:Enhance the state of the science for defining, measuring,
   monitoring, and improving the quality of cancer care, and inform both
   public- and private- sector decision making on cancer care delivery,
   coverage, regulation, and standards setting.

   Reducing Cancer-Related Health Disparities
   Goal: To understand the causes of cancer health disparities and develop
   effective interventions to reduce or eliminate them.

   Informatics and Information Flow
   Goal: To create an informatics infrastructure that enhances information
   and resource exchange among researchers.

   Cancer Research Training and Career Development
   Goal: To prepare a stable, diverse cadre of scientists to work together
   and use technologies for building knowledge and translating discoveries
   into application.
