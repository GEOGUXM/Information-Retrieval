   What is El Niño?
     * A description of how El Niño forms and the effect of El Niño on
       Southwest weather.

   [Santa Cruz River, Tucson, 10/2/83]

   Streamflow and Flooding:
     * The Southwest experiences enhanced streamflow and seasonal snow
       water content during the mature winter phase of El Niño. The
       various conditions that can lead to flooding are affected by El
       Niño in different ways from region to region and from event to
       event.

   Lake Level Rise:
     * Any long-term increase in precipitation and runoff in the arid
       southwest (like during an El Niño) potentially can lead to rising
       water levels of terminal lakes.

   Landslides and Debris Flows:
     * Some of the most destructive landslides and debris flows in the
       Southwest over the past few decades have occurred during El Niño
       events.
