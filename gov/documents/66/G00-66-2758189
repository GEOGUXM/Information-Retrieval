   Science Objectives for a Major Next Step Magnetic Fusion Experiment
   Explore and understand the strong non-linear coupling that is
   fundamental to fusion-dominated plasma behavior (self-organization) *
   Energy and particle transport (extend confinement predictability) *
   Macroscopic stability ( -limit, wall stabilization, NTMs) *
   Wave-particle interactions (fast alpha particle driven effects) *
   Plasma boundary (density limit, power and particle flow) * Test/Develop
   techniques to control and optimize fusion-dominated plasmas. * Sustain
   fusion-dominated plasmas - high-power-density exhaust of plasma
   particles and energy, alpha ash exhaust, study effects of profile
   evolution due to alpha heating on macro stability, transport barriers
   and energetic particle modes. * Explore and understand various advanced
   operating modes and configurations in fusion-dominated plasmas to
   provide generic knowledge for fusion and non-fusion plasma science, and
   to provide a foundation for attractive fusion applications. Stepping

   High-Field Tokamak Burning Plasma Experiment(s) would be a natural
   extension of the ongoing "advanced" tokamak program and could begin
   alpha- dominated experiments by ~ 10 years. * More than one high gain
   burning plasma facility is needed in the world program. * The
   information "exists now" to make a technical assessment, and decision
   on MFE burning plasma experiments for the next decade. A Modular

   chosen to be a "stepping stone" between the physics accessible with
   present experiments and the physics required for the ARIES vision of
   magnetic fusion energy. * A compact high field tokamak, like FIRE, has
   the potential: * address the important burning plasma issues, * most of
   the advanced tokamak issues and, * begin to study the strong non-linear
   coupling between BP and AT under quasi-stationary conditions in a $1B
   class facility. * Some areas that need additional work to realize this
   potential include: * Apply JT-60U enhanced confinement and advanced
   modes to FIRE * Understand conditions for enhanced confinement regimes
   in JT-60 * Compare DN relative to SN - confinement, stability,
   divertor, etc * Review JT-60U divertor results and apply to FIRE *
   Develop better disruption control/mitigation techniques. * Others from
   this discussion. Panel Recommendation Fully Endorsed by FESAC August 2,
   2001 3. The US Fusion Energy Sciences Program should establish a
   proactive US plan on burning plasma experiments and should not assume a
   default position of waiting to see what the international community may
   or may not do regarding the construction of a burning plasma
   experiment. If the opportunity for international collaboration occurs,
   the US should be ready to act and take advantage of it, but should not
   be dependent upon it. The US should implement a plan as follows to
   proceed towards construction of a burning plasma experiment: * Hold a
   "Snowmass" workshop in the summer, 2002 for the critical scientific and
   technological examination of proposed burning plasma experimental
   designs and to provide crucial community input and endorsement to the
   planning activities undertaken by FESAC. Specifically, the workshop
   should determine which of the specific burning plasma options are
   technically viable, but should not select among them. The workshop
   would further confirm that a critical mass of fusion scientists believe
   that the time to proceed is now and not some undefined time in the
   future. * Carry out a uniform technical assessment led by the NSO
   program of each of the burning plasma experimental options for input
   into the Snowmass summer study. * Request the Director of the Office of
   Energy Sciences to charge FESAC with the mission of forming an "action"
   panel in Spring, 2002 to select among the technically viable burning
   plasma experimental options. The selected option should be communicated
   to the Director of the Office of Science by January, 2003. * Initiate a
   review by a National Research Council panel in Spring, 2002, with the
   goal of determining the desirability as well as the scientific and
   technological credibility of the burning plasma experiment design by
   Fall, 2003. This is consistent with a submission of a report by DOE to
   congress no later than July, 2004. * Initiate an outreach effort
   coordinated by FESAC (or an ad-hoc body) to establish an appreciation
   and support for a burning plasma experiment from science and energy
   policy makers, the broader scientific community, environmentalists and
   the general public. This effort should begin now.
