Information Collected and Stored Automatically

   If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website,
   read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
   information about your visit automatically. This information does not
   identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the
   following information about your visit:
    1. The Internet domain (for example, "your-internet-provider.com" if
       you use a private Internet access account, or "your-school.edu" if
       you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP
       address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer
       whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our
       website;
    2. The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
    3. The date and time you access our site;
    4. The pages you visit; and
    5. If you linked to the Risk Management Agency's website from another
       website, the address of that website.

   We use this information to help us make our site more useful to
   visitors -- to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the
   types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record
   information about individuals and their visits.

Security Notice

   This USDA RMA website is provided as a public service. Information
   presented on this website is considered public information and may be
   distributed or copied. Use of appropriate byline/photo/image credits is
   requested.

   The following additional conditions apply to visitors of U.S.
   government websites:

    1. You have connected to a U.S. government computer if you are not
       authorized access to this system, disconnect now. All attempts to
       access and use this system and/or its resources are subject to
       keystroke monitoring and recording. Everyone using this system
       expressly consents to such monitoring and is advised that if such
       reveals possible evidence of criminal activity or abuse of
       authority, the information will be reported to authorities for
       action. Unauthorized access attempts or use in excess of documented
       authority may subject you to a fine and/or imprisonment in
       accordance with Title 18, USC, Section 1030 or administrative
       penalties or dismissal.
    2. For site management, information is collected for statistical
       purposes. This government computer system uses software programs to
       create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as
       assessing what information is of most and least interest,
       determining technical design specifications, and identifying system
       performance or problem areas.
    3. For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
       available to all users, this government computer system employs
       software programs to monitor network traffic to identify
       unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise
       cause damage.
    4. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other
       attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage
       habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are
       scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with regulations of
       the National Archives and Records Administration General Schedule
       20.
    5. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information
       on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under
       the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National
       Information Infrastructure Protection Act.

  Cookies

   A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser--
   along with a Web page-- when you access a website. There are two kinds
   of cookies. A session cookie is a line of text that is stored
   temporarily in your computer's RAM. Because a session cookie is never
   written to a drive, it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser.
   A persistent cookie is a more permanent line of text that gets saved by
   your browser to a file on your hard drive. Depending on your browser
   settings, you may receive notification that a given site is requesting
   cookie information, possibly with an expiration date. Persistent
   cookies have an expiration date in the future. Session cookies have no
   expiration date associated with them and are erased automatically when
   you close your browser.
    1. Our website does not use persistent/permanent cookies.
    2. Some areas of our websites use session/temporary cookies to provide
       advanced functionality and enhance performance during your visit.
       As an example, our Premium Calculation web application requires the
       use of temporary cookies in order to store information from page to
       page as you fill in online forms.
    3. All session cookies created by our websites are set to expire
       immediately, and will be erased automatically as soon as you close
       your web browser.

  Personal Information

   If you choose to provide us with personal information, as in an email
   or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting
   it to us through our website, we use that information to respond to
   your message and to help us locate for you the information you have
   requested.

   We treat emails the same way that we regard letters sent to us. We are
   required to maintain many documents under the Presidential Records Act
   for historical purposes, but we do not collect personal information for
   any purpose other than to respond to you. We only share the information
   you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to
   that agency, or as otherwise required by law. Moreover, we do not
   create individual profiles with the information you provide or to give
   it to any private organizations.

  Links to Other Sites

   The website has links to many other federal government agencies and
   some private organizations. Once you link to another site, you are
   subject to the privacy policy of the new site.

   If you have any questions or comments about the information presented
   here, please forward them to: RMA_mail@wdc.usda.gov
