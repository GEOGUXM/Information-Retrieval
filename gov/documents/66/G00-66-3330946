   Objective

   The objectives of the AIST Program are to identify, develop and (where
   appropriate) demonstrate advanced information system technologies
   which:
     * Reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of Earth Science
       Enterprise (ESE) space-based and ground-based information systems,
     * Increase the accessibility and utility of Earth science data, and
     * Enable new Earth observation measurements and information products.

   Technology Drivers

   The AIST Program is founded on technology needs for Earth science
   measurement, analysis, and application objectives, as identified the
   ESE Strategic Plan. In 1999, ESTO sponsored a request for information
   and workshop involving the Earth science and computer science
   communities to help guide the definition of technology needs which
   resulted in the AIST Capabilities and Needs (CN) Database. The CN
   Database is referenced in AIST technology solicitations. In 2000, ESTO
   sponsored a technology projection workshop that assessed emerging
   information technology for ESE space and ground use that resulted in
   the AIST Key Space and Ground Investment Roadmaps. The roadmaps,
   coupled with analysis of nominal future Earth science scenarios, are
   used to provide weighting criteria for the CN Database, which is then
   refined to guide future NRA and other solicitations for technology
   development.

   Several other initiatives and programs within ESE provide technology
   drivers to the AIST Program. These include the current Earth Observing
   System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), the Earth Science
   Information Partners (ESIP Federation) and NASA's New Data and
   Information Systems and Services (NewDISS). The long term Earth Science
   Vision activity also presents significant technology challenges for
   information systems. Based on a cyclic analysis of technology need,
   AIST identifies and prioritizes ESE information technology goals.

   Investments

   The AIST Program currently has two investments programs:
     * AIST NASA Research Announcement (NRA) for space-based information
       systems technology released in 1999 that resulted in 30 AIST NRA
       Awards, and
     * EOSDIS Prototyping Program for ground-based information systems
       technology.

   AIST investments are monitored via on-line Award Administration
   e-Books, where technical reports and associated information are managed
   to support technology infusion goals. These technologies are also
   identified in the NASA Technology Inventory Database.

   Technology Infusion Opportunities

   Many technology infusion candidates are targeted for AIST developments.
   The New Millennium Program (NMP) develops Earth Observing missions to
   flight validate new technology. The post-2002 Earth science mission
   planning activities identified science objectives and some technology
   drivers. This information is being expanded with insights on new
   missions, some currently in formulation, such as NPOES Preparatory
   Program (NPP), Global Precipitation Mission (GPM), Landsat Data
   Continuity Mission (LDCM), Tropospheric Winds, Global Earthquake, and
   others. Other initiatives and programs within ESE include EOSDIS, the
   ESIP Federation, the NewDISS currently in formulation, and the Earth
   Science Vision as that concept matures.

   Related IT Programs

   In addition to managing technology investments, the AIST Program
   evaluates related technology programs to assess where external
   investments may be leveraged to support ESE technology needs. Key NASA
   programs from Earth Science, Office of Aerospace Technology (OAT), and
   Office of Space Science (OSS), among others, that address information
   technology include:
     * Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP-2) Federation
     * Earth and Space Science CAN awards (ESS)
     * Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR/STTR)
     * OAT Intelligent Systems NRA awards (Intelligent Data Understanding
       track)
     * Space Operations and Management Office (SOMO)
     * OAT Space Based Technology Program (Cross-Enterprise)
     * OSS Applied Information Systems Research Program (AISRP)
     * OAT Information Technology (IT)
