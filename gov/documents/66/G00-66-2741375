   Hitometer The Critical Issues Forum (CIF) was established to give
   students and teachers the opportunity to address issues and
   circumstances involved in safeguarding nuclear weapons. The project was
   developed by Richard Alexander and William Robertson for the Department
   of Energy - Office of Defense Programs. As we first began to develop
   the CIF program, we made a conscious decision to develop a curriculum
   model that encompassed our educational philosophies and experiences as
   they pertained to successful teaching and learning practices. This
   model became the "Critical Thinking Curriculum Model (CTCM)." Select
   the CTCM Model Info button to learn more about the model and how to
   implement our curricula or how to use it to develop and implement your
   own curriculum.
