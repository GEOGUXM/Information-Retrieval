                                Introduction

       The California Law Revision Commission was created in 1953 as the
   permanent successor to the Code Commission and given responsibility for
   the continuing substantive review of California statutory and
   decisional law. The Commission studies the law in order to discover
   defects and anachronisms and recommends legislation to make needed
   reforms. (See the Commission's governing statute.)

       The Commission assists the Legislature in keeping the law up to
   date by:

     * Intensively studying complex and sometimes controversial subjects
     * Identifying major policy questions for legislative attention
     * Gathering the views of interested persons and organizations
     * Drafting recommended legislation for legislative consideration

       The Commission's efforts enable the Legislature to focus on
   significant policy questions in a recommendation rather than on the
   technical issues which can be resolved in the process of preparing
   background studies, working out intricate legal problems, and drafting
   implementing legislation. The Commission thus helps the Legislature
   accomplish needed reforms that otherwise might not be made because of
   the heavy demands on legislative time. In some cases, the Commission's
   report demonstrates that no new legislation on a particular topic is
   needed, thus relieving the Legislature of the need to study the topic.

       The Commission consists of:

     * A Member of the Senate appointed by the Rules Committee
     * A Member of the Assembly appointed by the Speaker
     * Seven members appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent
       of the Senate
     * The Legislative Counsel, who is an ex officio member

       The Commission may study only topics that the Legislature has
   authorized. The Commission now has a calendar of 20 topics.

       The Commission has submitted 334 recommendations to the Legislature
   -- 314 have been enacted in whole or in substantial part. Commission
   recommendations have resulted in the enactment of legislation affecting
   19,993 sections of the California statutes: 3,743 sections amended,
   9,072 sections added, and 7,118 sections repealed. For a comprehensive
   list, see Legislative action on Commission recommendations.

       The Commission's recommendations are published in softcover and
   later are collected in hardcover volumes. See list of past publications
   and information on obtaining copies.

                    Function and Procedure of Commission

       The principal duties of the Commission are to:

     * Examine the common law and statutes for the purpose of discovering
       defects and anachronisms.
     * Receive and consider suggestions and proposed changes in the law
       from the American Law Institute, the National Conference of
       Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, bar associations, and other
       learned bodies, and from judges, public officials, lawyers, and the
       public generally.
     * Recommend such changes in the law as it deems necessary to bring
       California law into harmony with modern conditions.

       The Commission is required to file a report at each regular session
   of the Legislature containing a calendar of topics selected by it for
   study, listing both studies in progress and topics intended for future
   consideration. As a general rule, the Commission may study only topics
   that the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, authorizes for study.
   However, the Commission may study and recommend revisions to correct
   technical or minor substantive defects in state statutes without a
   prior concurrent resolution.

    Background Studies

       The Commission's work on a recommendation begins after a background
   study has been prepared. (Downloadable studies in FTP Directory.) The
   background study may be prepared by a member of the Commission's staff
   or by a specialist in the field who is retained as a consultant. Law
   professors and practicing attorneys who serve as consultants have
   already acquired the considerable knowledge necessary to understand the
   specific problems under consideration, and they receive little more
   than an honorarium for their services. From time to time, expert
   consultants are also retained to advise the Commission at meetings.

    Recommendations

       After making its preliminary decisions on a subject, the Commission
   ordinarily distributes a tentative recommendation to interested persons
   and organizations, including the State Bar, local and specialized bar
   associations, public interest organizations, and business and
   professional associations. (Tentative recommendations currently
   available for review.) Notice of the availability of the tentative
   recommendation is mailed to interested persons on the Commission's
   mailing list and publicized in legal newspapers and other relevant
   publications. Notice is also posted on the Commission's website and
   emailed to interested persons.

       Comments on the tentative recommendation are considered by the
   Commission in determining what recommendation, if any, the Commission
   will make to the Legislature. (Downloadable recommendations in FTP
   Directory.) When the Commission has reached a conclusion on the matter,
   its recommendation to the Legislature (including a draft of any
   legislation necessary to effectuate its recommendation) is published
   and distributed in printed form and electronically on the Commission's
   website. If a background study has been prepared in connection with the
   recommendation, it may be published by the Commission or in a law
   review.

    Official Comments

       The Commission ordinarily prepares an official Comment explaining
   each section it recommends. These Comments are included in the
   Commission's printed recommendations. Comments may be revised by the
   Commission in later reports to reflect amendments made in the
   legislative process. The reports provide background with respect to
   Commission intent in proposing the enactment, such intent being
   reflected in the Comments to the various sections of the bill contained
   in the Commission's recommendation, except to the extent that new or
   revised Comments are set out in the report on the bill as amended.

       A Commission Comment indicates the derivation of a section and
   often explains its purpose, its relation to other sections, and
   potential issues concerning its meaning or application. The Comments
   are legislative history and are entitled to substantial weight in
   construing the statutory provisions. However, while the Commission
   endeavors in Comments to explain any changes in the law made by a
   section, the Commission does not claim that every inconsistent case is
   noted in the Comments, nor can it anticipate judicial conclusions as to
   the significance of existing case authorities. Hence, failure to note a
   change in prior law or to refer to an inconsistent judicial decision is
   not intended to, and should not, influence the construction of a
   clearly-stated statutory provision.

       Comments are provided to legislative committee members and staff
   before a bill is heard and at later stages throughout the legislative
   process. Comments are provided to the Governor's office once a bill has
   passed the Legislature and is before the Governor for action.

    Publications

       Commission materials and publications are distributed to the
   Governor, legislative leadership, and, on request, to heads of state
   departments and to interest groups, lawyers, law professors, courts,
   district attorneys, and law libraries throughout the state. Thus, a
   large and representative number of interested persons is given an
   opportunity to study and comment on the Commission's work before it is
   considered for enactment by the Legislature. (Bills in current
   session.)

       The Commission's reports, recommendations, and studies are
   collected in hardcover volumes that serve as a permanent record of the
   Commission's work and, it is believed, a valuable contribution to the
   legal literature of California. These volumes are available at many
   county law libraries and at some other libraries. Half of the hardcover
   volumes are out of print, but others are available for purchase. A
   catalog of publications is available.

    Electronic Publication and Internet Access

       Since June 1995, the Commission has provided a variety of
   information on the Internet, including online material and downloadable
   files. Interested persons with Internet access can find current
   agendas, meeting minutes, background studies, staff memorandums,
   tentative recommendations, final recommendations, and general
   background information.

       The Commission distributes about two-thirds of its tentative and
   final meeting agendas through email and also gives notice of the
   availability of tentative recommendations and printed reports by email.
   The Commission encourages use of email as an inexpensive and expedient
   means of communication with the Commission.

                               Plans for 2002

                          2002 Legislative Program

   (Current legislative program.)     In 2002, the Commission plans to
   submit recommendations to the Legislature concerning the following
   subjects:

   Civil Procedure and Judicial Administration

       Statutes Made Obsolete by Trial Court Restructuring. The Commission
   will recommend amendment or repeal of numerous statutes made obsolete
   by restructuring of the trial court system as a result of trial court
   unification, state funding of trial courts, and enactment of the Trial
   Court Employment Protection and Governance Act.

       Cases in Which Court Reporter Is Required. The Commission will
   recommend revisions to consolidate the rules governing when a court
   reporter must be provided in civil and criminal cases. Nonsubstantive
   revisions would also be made to clarify the application of the statute,
   consistent with existing law.

   Debtor-Creditor Law

       Debtor-Creditor Law Technical Revisions. The Commission will
   recommend revisions in the statutes relating to claim and delivery,
   attachment, and enforcement of judgments to address a number of
   procedural issues.

       Municipal Bankruptcy. The Commission will recommend updating state
   statutes authorizing public entities to file for bankruptcy protection
   under the federal Bankruptcy Code.

   Eminent Domain

       Prejudgment Deposit Appraisal in Eminent Domain. The Commission
   will recommend that a prejudgment deposit appraisal may be used for
   impeachment purposes with respect to the trial valuation testimony of
   the appraiser who prepared the prejudgment deposit appraisal.

   Estate Planning, Probate, and Trusts

       Rules of Construction for Trusts. The Commission will recommend
   limitations on, and improvements of, the rules governing construction
   of wills as applied to trusts and other instruments.

   Mechanic's Liens

       Mechanic's Lien Law. The Commission will recommend revisions to
   address the double payment problem arising under home improvement
   contracts and will also propose a general technical revision and
   reorganization of the mechanic's lien law.

       Stay of Mechanic's Lien Enforcement Pending Arbitration. The
   Commission will recommend revisions to simplify and improve the
   procedure for obtaining a stay of a mechanic's lien foreclosure action
   pending arbitration.

                          Major Studies in Progress

       During 2002, the Commission will work on the following major
   topics: continuing study of obsolete provisions resulting from trial
   court restructuring, common interest development law, discovery
   improvements from other jurisdictions, review of criminal procedures
   under trial court unification, the Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit
   Association Act, and the Uniform Trust Code. The Commission will also
   consider other subjects to the extent time permits.

   Statutes Rendered Obsolete by Trial Court Restructuring

       The Legislature has directed the Commission to recommend repeal of
   statutes rendered obsolete by the Trial Court Employment Protection and
   Governance Act, the Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997,
   and the implementation of trial court unification. The Commission's
   report is due by January 1, 2002. The Commission will recommend
   amendment or repeal of numerous statutes. However, there remain many
   others that require further study due to their complexity or as a
   result of the failure of stakeholders to agree on policy, or simply
   because more time is needed to adequately address them. The Commission
   will recommend repeal of the statutory deadline and plans to continue
   work in this area.

   Common Interest Development Law

       The Commission will review the statutes affecting common interest
   housing developments with the goal of setting a clear, consistent, and
   unified policy regarding their formation and management and the
   transaction of real property interests located within them. The
   objective of the review is to clarify the law and eliminate unnecessary
   or obsolete provisions, to consolidate existing statutes in one place
   in the codes, and to determine to what extent common interest
   developments should be subject to regulation. During 2002 the
   Commission will give priority to issues involving nonjudicial
   resolution of intra-association disputes and due process in association
   decisionmaking.

   Discovery Improvements from Other Jurisdictions

       The Commission in 2002 will review discovery developments in other
   jurisdictions to determine whether any of them may be appropriate
   models for improvement of discovery practice in California. Professor
   Gregory Weber of McGeorge Law School has prepared a background study
   for the Commission, which the Commission has circulated for comment.

   Review of Criminal Procedures Under Trial Court Unification

       The Commission is conducting a review of basic court procedures
   under unification. In 2002, the Commission will begin a study to
   determine what, if any, changes should be made with respect to criminal
   procedures. The Commission has retained Professor Gerald Uelmen of
   Santa Clara University Law School to prepare a background study.

   Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act

       The Commission has commenced work on a project to determine whether
   the Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act should be adopted
   in California in whole or in part. The Commission is assisted by
   Professor Michael Hone of the University of San Francisco Law School.
   The Commission is working closely with the State Bar Nonprofit
   Organizations Committee.

   Uniform Trust Code

       The Commission in 2002 will begin a review of the Uniform Trust
   Code (2000) to determine whether any of its provisions that differ from
   California law should be adopted here. The Commission has engaged
   Professor David English of the University of Missouri Law School
   (Reporter for the Uniform Trust Code) to prepare a comparison of the
   uniform code with California law.

   Other Subjects

       The major studies in progress described above will dominate the
   Commission's time and resources during 2002. The Commission will
   consider other subjects as time permits, including civil and appellate
   jurisdiction issues resulting from trial court unification, Evidence
   Code changes required by electronic communications, general assignments
   for the benefit of creditors, exhaustion of remedies and ripeness
   issues in inverse condemnation litigation, shifting of attorney fees
   between litigants, and statutes of limitation in legal malpractice
   actions.
