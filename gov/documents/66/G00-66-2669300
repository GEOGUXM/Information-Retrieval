   Understanding the Global Water Cycle   [ Modeling Home ]  [ IR Remote
   Sensing Home ]

   The presence of water as solid, liquid, and gas is a feature that makes
   Earth unique in the solar system, and that makes possible life as we
   know it. The transport of water and the energy exchanged as it is
   converted from one state to another are important drivers in our
   weather and climate. One of the key missions of the GHCC is to develop
   a better understanding of the global water cycle at a variety of scales
   so that we can improve model forecasts of climate trends, predictions
   of short-term and regional weather events, and even their impacts on
   society's regional and global activities.

   [goeswater.gif] Although water vapor is the most important greenhouse
   gas, we haven't adequately sampled its four-dimensional
   variability--across space and time--over the globe. Recent analyses of
   global satellite data have produced many new observational data sets
   that describe the vertical and horizontal structure of moisture over
   the last 10 to 20 years. These data sets are being analyzed and
   validated to document the satellite measurements' capability to
   describe accurately various components of the hydrologic cycle. In some
   cases, the trends observed by satellites are consistent with
   predictions by computer models, while in others, there are significant
   discrepancies. Understanding when and why the models are right or wrong
   and the nature and limitations of satellite data is key to their
   intelligent use in climate studies.

   [cooling.gif] Year-to-year variations in rainfall and temperature
   dominate our sense of climate variability. We have only to look at the
   1997-98 El Niño event to reaffirm the societal costs in terms of human
   suffering and economic losses. A major challenge to climate researchers
   is to determine the degree of predictability associated with these and
   other events. While El Niño is the best known of these phenomena, there
   are other modes of variability that may or may not be predictable.

   GHCC scientists are engaged in this research in a number of ways. One
   major task is the development of consistent descriptions of how changes
   in the ocean and land surface temperatures alter the atmospheric winds,
   temperatures, and moisture that cause regional droughts or excessive
   rainfall on continental scales. However, these diverse data sets are
   far from error free. Recently we developed a method of blending
   satellite observations of radiation, precipitation, and water vapor to
   correct our models of poorly measured winds that are important in
   circulating moisture and heat energy over the globe. By synthesizing
   descriptions of atmospheric processes and comparing them to climate
   model projections, we have been able to study how well (or how poorly)
   climate models perform--and why. As a result, several efforts are now
   under way to improve how clouds are represented in climate models.

   [assimilate.gif] GHCC research scientists are developing a water budget
   diagnostic model designed to estimate the three-dimensional fields of
   vapor, cloud condensate, and precipitation around the globe as a
   function of time. The model uses wind, temperature, and initial
   moisture fields from a global four-dimensional data set, then marches
   forward in time. To constrain the evolution of the simulated water
   vapor field (and the resulting cloud fields and precipitation), data
   from the satellite-borne Special Sensor/Microwave Imaging precipitable
   water (total water vapor in a column of air) measurements over the
   oceans, for example, are used to constrain the evolving water vapor in
   the model. The local moisture profiles are rescaled to give values of
   precipitable water equal to those observed by the satellite, when
   satellite data are available.

   While climate anomalies frequently assume continental or oceanic
   proportion, it is ultimately the local or "human" scale that is of
   importance to users. Regional scale modeling of hydrologic processes
   over domains the size of the southeastern U.S. are an important part of
   our research strategy. Research funded under NASA's Earth Science
   Enterprise and other Federal programs is aimed at understanding warm
   season precipitation and hydrology. Assimilating satellite-derived land
   surface temperature data into regional models is helping improve
   predictions of low-level temperature, moisture, clouds, and the
   resulting precipitation.
