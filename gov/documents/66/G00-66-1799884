                                Introduction

    The Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety filed a lawsuit against the
   Department of Energy, and Siegfried Hecker, Director of the Los Alamos
    National Laboratory in 1994 alleging violations of the Clean Air Act.
      The parties settled the lawsuit out of court on January 25, 1997.

                               Consent Decree

                   IV.A.4. Comprehensive Technical Audits

   The first technical audit began on June 23, 1997, and the final report
   was issued in November 1999. The final report indicates that LANL meets
   the 10 mrem off-site dose standard but does not meet several technical
     requirements of 40 CFR 61 Subpart H. Although the Laboratory agrees
      that technical recommendations made in the RAC final report would
    enhance the quality of the radionuclide NESHAP program, LANL did not
     agree that these findings demonstrate noncompliance with the NESHAP
       regulation during 1996 and did not modify its certification of
    compliance sent to EPA for that year. The Laboratory implemented most
   of the technical recommendations contained in the final RAC assessment
     report. The Laboratory submitted a final report to DOE, and DOE has
      provided copies to EPA, Region VI, CCNS, and to the Laboratory's
                           Community Reading Room.

      Copies of the report can be requested by clicking on "questions,
           comments, and suggestions" at the bottom of this page.

   In May 2000, the second in a series of independent technical audits of
      the Laboratory's Radioactive Air Emissions Compliance program was
    initiated. The final report for this second audit was issued on Dec.
    13, 2000, at a press conference in Santa Fe. According to the report,
    the audit team determined that the Laboratory was in compliance with
   the federal regulations governing radioactive air emissions, 40 CFR 61,
                     Subpart H, for the audit year 1999.

    Copies of this report, "Independent Technical Audit of the Los Alamos
   National Laboratory for Compliance with the Clearn Air Act, 40 CFR 61,
    Subpart H in 1999," can be also requested by clicking on "questions,
           comments, and suggestions" at the bottom of this page.

                       IV.A.5 Payments to the Treasury

      The Department of Energy has paid $150,000 to the Treasury of the
                               United States.

            IV.A.6.1 Environmentally Beneficial Projects - AIRNET

    The 4 Area G stations are being and will continue to be operated over
     the next five years. These stations are currently operated with the
     same requirements that apply to Subpart H compliance stations. The
    TA-33 station began operation on April 28, 1997. The Santa Fe station
   has been installed in Northwest Santa Fe and became operational during
   the week of August 4, 1997. Quarterly raw data and analysis reports are
     being sent to CCNS and the LANL reading room. These AIRNET data are
                      also available on this web site.

      IV.A.6.2 Environmentally Beneficial Projects - Thermoluminescent
                              Dosimeters (TLDs)

    All additional TLDs have been placed in the required locations. This
     task was completed May 19, 1997. An independent laboratory has been
      contracted to carry out the reading and analysis of the duplicate
    quality assurance TLDs. The two year's of independent TLD monitoring
   was completed at the end of calendar year 1999. Quarterly raw data and
     analysis reports are being sent to CCNS and the LANL reading room.

            IV.A.6.3 Environmentally Beneficial Projects - NEWNET

     The NEWNET system has undergone calibration and maintenance and is
    fully operational. A Spanish translation of the web site came on-line
                                 June 1998.

   IV.B.7. Siegfried Hecker - Presidents Council on National Laboratories

   Dr. Hecker has used the influence of his office and his best efforts to
   persuade the University of California ESH Panel to allocate one day of
   each annual visit to New Mexico to hear environmental issues related to
     LANL. The ESH panel conducted this meeting on July 31, 1997 during
                    their scheduled visit to New Mexico.

                IV.B.8. Siegfried Hecker - Meeting with CCNS

     Through mutual agreement, Dr. Hecker and CCNS met on July 29, 1997,
    regarding the protection of employees from retaliation or harassment
     for voicing environmental concerns and regarding CCNS environmental
     concerns. Tom Todd, Manager of the DOE Los Alamos Area Office, also
                           attended this meeting.

                IV.B.9. Siegfried Hecker - Community Meetings

   A series of public meetings has been initiated by Dr. Hecker. The first
    public meeting was held on June 17, 1997, at the St. Johns College in
    Santa Fe. The format of the initial meeting was an environmental fair
   while the remainder have been panel style, providing ESH subject matter
    experts on many environmental issues for discussions with the public.
   The second meeting focused on contamination in water and sediments (as
     requested by public input from the 1st meeting) and was held in Los
     Alamos on September 24, 1997. The subject of the third meeting was
    updated information on thyroid cancer and brain tumors in Los Alamos
    County. The 3rd meeting was held in Los Alamos on November 5, 1997. A
     4th meeting was held at the Pueblo de San Ildefonso on December 3,
   1997, for discussion on the environmental restoration program. Meetings
   were held in 1998 on environmental monitoring, the independent audit of
        the LANL rad-NESHAP program, wildland fire management and the
              Threatened & Endangered Species Management Plan.

    During 1999, the Laboratory held three public meetings. The first one
    of these meetings titled "Environmental Monitoring" was held in April
    1999 in Espanola. A second meeting, "High Explosives Contamination in
     the Ground Water," took place in June 1999 in Los Alamos. The third
   meeting, "Cancer Trends in Los Alamos," was held in Los Alamos in July
                                    1999.

   During 2000, the Laboratory held two public meetings. The first meeting
     was entitled "Criticality Accidents and Radiation Exposure" and was
   held in March in Santa Fe. A second meeting, "Wildfire 2000: Los Alamos
      at Risk," was held on April 26 in Los Alamos. Following the Cerro
   Grande fire, numerous public meetings were held in conjunction with the
                         NMED, EPA, CCNS and others.

                            Settlement Agreement

                  1. University of New Mexico (UNM) Funding

    UNM School of Medicine received $ 150,000 in April 1997 and $ 150,000
   in March 1998. The final payment of $ 150,000 was made in the spring of
                                    1999.

                       2. Radiation Education Training

         The course took place in Espanola on September 8-12, 1997.

                              3. Equipment Loan

   The equipment for the repository has been purchased. Equipment includes
    a portable radiation monitor, a gas proportional alpha-beta detector,
   an alpha scintillator, a GM probe (for monitoring beta-gamma), a sodium
     iodide probe, and a neutron detector. All of these instruments are
    standard portable, radiation monitoring equipment. The ORISE training
   course (September 8-12, 1997) included the specific procedures for the
    use of this equipment. The Laboratory has purchased a portable gamma
    spectroscopy instrument for use in this program. A training class for
      users of this instrument was offered on March 13, 1998. Training
      classes will be offered on an annual basis or whenever requested.
