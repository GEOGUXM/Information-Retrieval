     A. Internet Online Summit, December 1-3, 1997

     After the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Communications
     Decency Act (CDA) in 1996, industry members, advocacy groups, and
     law enforcement (including CCIPS), many which had been on opposite
     sides in the CDA litigation, joined forces to sponsor the "Internet
     Online Summit: Focus on Children." The Summit's mission was to
     promote voluntary measures and technology tools to protect children
     from online predators and child pornographers. At the summit, the
     online service providers representing 95% of the home users market
     announced a "Zero Tolerance Policy" for child pornography. The
     Attorney General announced, among other initiatives, the formation
     of an industry-law enforcement "Safety Forum", and the sponsorship
     of a 24-hour "CyberTipLine", to be run by the National Center for
     Missing and Exploited Children. Vice President Gore also addressed
     the Summit, congratulating industry providers for their efforts to
     combat child predators and child pornographers, and announcing a
     public education campaign and Internet teach-in, aimed at making the
     Internet a safe place for children and families.

     B. Hate Speech and the Internet

     In November 1997, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
     sponsored a seminar in Geneva, Switzerland on Hate Speech and the
     Internet. A CCIPS attorney delivered a speech outlining the First
     Amendment principles protecting racially biased speech against
     government censorship. The text of the speech is available via the
     link below:

       Propaganda on the Internet: The U.S. Perspective

     C. 1997 Report on the Availability of Bombmaking Information

     In section 709(a) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty
     Act of 1996 ["the AEDPA"],Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, 1297
     (1996), Congress provided that, inconsultation with such other
     officials and individuals as she
     considers appropriate, the Attorney General shall conduct a study
     concerning  various issues related to availability to the public
     material in any medium (including print, electronic,  or film) that
     provides instructionon how to make bombs, destructive devices, of
     weapons of mass destruction; the extent to which information gained
     from such material has been used in incidents of domestic of
     international terrorism; the likelihood that such information may be
     used in future incidents of terrorism; the application of Federal
     laws in effect on the date of enactment of this Act to such
     material; the need and utility, if any, for additional laws relating
     to such material; and an assessment of the extent to which the first
     amendment protects such material and its private and commercial
     distribution.

     Section 709(b) of the AEDPA, in turn, requires the Attorney General
     to submit to the Congress a report containing the results of the
     study, and to make that report available to the public. That report
     was submitted to Congress in April 1997. It is available via the

     D. Cyberstalking and Harassing Speech

     Cyberstalking

     On April 21, 2000, Lynne A. Battaglia, United States Attorney for
     the District of Maryland, announced that Warren Gray, a 19-year old
     Upper Marlboro, Maryland man, pleaded guilty to five counts of
     sending threatening e-mails to a Largo High School administrator at
     the same time as Gray was stalking him last November.

       Administrator (April 21, 2000)

     The rapid growth of the Internet and other telecommunications
     technologies are promoting advances in virtually every aspect of
     society and every corner of the globe. Most of these advances
     represent positive changes in our society. Unfortunately, many of
     the attributes of this technology - low cost, ease of use, and
     anonymous nature, among others - make it an attractive medium for
     fraudulent scams, child sexual exploitation, and increasingly, a new
     concern known as "cyberstalking." Recognizing this emerging problem,
     Vice President Al Gore asked the Attorney General on February 26,
     1999, to study the problem and to report back with recommendations
     on how to protect people from this threat. The report can be found
     by following the link below:
     * "Cyberstalking: A New Challenge for Law Enforcement and Industry" A
       Report from the Attorney General to the Vice President (August
       1999)

     On April 21, 1999, Carl Edward Johnson, 49, of Bienfait,
     Saskatchewan, Canada, was convicted on four felony counts of sending
     threatening e-mail messages via the Internet to federal judges and
     others.  The charges were based on death threats posted to the
     Internet naming two federal judges based in Tacoma and Seattle and
     on an e-mail threat sent directly to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.
     Although Johnson had used anonymous remailers and forged e-mail
     address information in an attempt to disguise his identity, Judge
     Bryan found that the Government's technical evidence proved Johnsons
     authorship.  On June 11, 1999, Johnson was sentenced to thirty-seven
     months of imprisonment for his crimes.

     Harassing Speech

     On October 16, 1998, an individual pleaded guilty in the Eastern
     District of Virginia to a felony for repeatedly causing e-mail to be
     transmitted over the Internet solely with the intent to harass
     another individual. Additional information regarding this case is
     available via the link below:

       messages to be sent to a senior, supervisory level employee of the
       Department of Defense (October 16, 1998)
