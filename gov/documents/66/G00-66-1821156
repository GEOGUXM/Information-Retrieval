        X-ray concentrator will expand window on high-energy universe

              Capillary optics promise a range of applications

   [joy.tnl.jpg] Jan. 14, 1999: Funneling X-rays through microscopic glass
   tubes promises to give astronomers a sharper view of the energetic
   activities deep in space - and a better understanding of the chemical
   structure of life.

   "The concept is pretty simple," said Dr. Marshall Joy, an X-ray
   astronomer at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. "You gather X-rays
   at this end and funnel them down to the other end. You can think of it
   as a lens for x-rays. Right now, there's isn't anything else that does
   that for X-rays at high energies." (interview with Dr. Joy, below.)

   each fiber contains about 750 capillaries. Links to 1200x1366-pixel,

   Joy is the principal investigator for the capillary X-ray optics
   project at NASA/Marshall. Professors Walter Gibson and Carolyn
   MacDonald at the University at Albany, State University of New York and
   researchers at X-Ray Optical Systems Inc., also in Albany, work closely
   with NASA on this project. The work had seed funding from NASA's
   Microgravity Research Program (see Blueprint for proteins, below).

   The x-ray portion of the spectrum covers a large energy range, 100 to
   100,000 electron volts (100 eV to 100 keV) compared to about 2 to 4 eV
   for visible light. Astronomers have learned how to focus X-rays at low
   energies, but the middle and higher reaches of the X-ray spectrum are
   difficult to focus. It's as if we could only see the red portion of the
   visible light spectrum, and the universe darkened in the green spectrum
   and then went black altogether.

      [capil.tnl.jpg] "A lot of the universe emits at higher energies, but we
      just can't focus them yet," Joy explained. Energies above 10 keV can be
      studied only by coded-aperture pinhole cameras and other instruments
      that give a coarse view of the skies. This makes the 10 to 100 keV
      range one of the great unexplored frontiers in astrophysics.

   The closer you look, the more you see

      No one is sure what will be seen at higher energies, but the scientists
      are going on more than blind faith. They have precedent in their own
      field.

      "It's hard to know what you'll see until you see it," Joy said. "Until
      the 1970s, no one had a clue that the universe would be interesting in
      X-rays."

      Then came the Uhuru small astronomy satellite, NASA/Marshall's three
      large High Energy Astronomy Observatories, and others.

      "As it turned out, the sky was lit up in X-rays everywhere you looked,"
      Joy said.

      As with optical telescopes, astronomers discovered that whenever they
      looked with more sensitive telescopes, the more objects and the more
      detail they saw.

      But X-rays can be focused by the same effect that can make a
      transparent piece of glass act as a mirror: If light strikes glass at a
      shallow angle, the light is reflected, as if by a mirror. This is
      called "grazing incidence reflection" since the light just grazes the
      surface.

   X-ray throughput extends to high x-ray energies, and that the spot size
   in the focal plane decreases at high energies. AXAF and other X-ray
   telescopes can see no higher than 10keV. Links to 1481x676-pixel, 257KB

   "Normally, X-rays refuse to be reflected unless the angle of incidence
   is very small," Joy said. "They just penetrate the material rather than
   reflecting off of it." As X-ray energies become higher, the angle of
   incidence becomes incredibly small, far less than 1/10th of 1 degree.
   "Grazing incidence optics" are used in a variety of X-ray astronomy
   telescopes, including the Chandra X-ray Observatory (formerly called
   the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility) scheduled for launch in April
   1999.

   The Chandra X-ray Observatory observes in the 0.1 to 10 keV range.
   Capillary X-ray optics will extend the observable range from 10 to 80
   keV range.

   [nmd.tnl.jpg] Blueprints for proteins

      Improved drugs to treat cancers and other diseases may be designed with
      the help of capillary X-ray optics.

      "We expect this new technology to significantly accelerate the ability
      of researchers to gather the information necessary to design entire
      families of highly effective, disease-fighting drugs," said Dr. Daniel
      Carter of New Century Pharmaceuticals in Huntsville, Ala.

      Proteins, enzymes, genetic materials, and other organic molecules have
      a mechanical side. Chemical reactions occur only if the other molecule
      has the right shape to join receptors and activators. It's like fitting
      a key into a lock.

      The next generation of pharmaceuticals, already starting to emerge, is
      coming from "rational drug design" where scientists deduce the
      structures of proteins and enzymes in viruses, bacteria, and our own
      bodies, and then tailor drugs for specific functions, like hitting a
      virus's "off" switch. For example, pharmaceutical companies are
      developing drugs which inhibit the neuraminidase enzyme (above) which
      is crucial to the function of the flu virus. Links to 480x640-pixel,
      191KB JPG. (Center for Macromolecular Crystallography)

      But first, you have to learn the structures of these complex chemicals.
      NASA/Marshall has taken the lead in this promising field of
      biotechnology by growing hundreds of protein crystals aboard the Space
      Shuttle and Russia's space station Mir so the crystals could be
      examined on Earth. The International Space Station, now under
      construction, will expand on this work.

      Once returned to Earth, scientists examine the protein crystals by
      X-ray crystallography. The crystals have internal facets that reflect
      X-rays to form dot patterns that are unique to the structure of that
      protein at that particular viewing angle. Using a computer, scientists
      can turn the dot pattern into a model of the protein's structure - like
      the neuraminidase enzyme shown here - revealing where the atoms are
      located. From this, they can decipher the key-and-lock structure and
      learn how to change how the protein works.

      However, the process takes many hours and dozens of crystallograms,
      partly because the X-rays are relatively weak. Now the x-ray optics
      produce much brighter beams on the tiny organic samples, greatly
      decreasing the time needed to collect enough data to obtain a complete
      structure.

      "This new capillary X-ray technology will allow us to pursue more
      challenging research problems in our own laboratory with a speed and
      effectiveness never before possible," Carter said. "These and future
      applications should have a profound impact on many areas of science and
      medicine."

   Bending X-rays

      Capillary optics don't focus X-rays into images, but merely act as
      light guides to concentrate X-rays from a large area onto a small one.

      [bend.tnl.jpg] Left: X-rays striking at a shallow enough angle inside a
      capillary will be reflected. The curvature and angles are exaggerated
      for clarity. Links to 438x228-pixel, 36KB JPG. (NASA/Marshall and
      Albany/SUNY)

      Capillary optics start out as bundles of glass tubes that are heated
      and drawn until the bundles are just 300 to 600 microns wide and
      contain hundreds to thousands of channels 3 to 50 microns wide. That's
      so small that the tip of an eyelash would jam inside the opening of one
      capillary. It also means that even the smallest speck of contamination
      is like having a pebble stuck inside a straw.

      If the glass tubes are bent ever so gently, the X-rays graze the
      surface at just less than the critical angle. Imagine a race car
      bouncing back and forth between the guard rails as it barrels down the
      track. That's pretty much what X-rays do inside a glass capillary. And
      the capillaries can be bent so they concentrate the X-rays into a small
      area of the detector, making a smaller but brighter image. That's
      important in any detector system since noise is always present. A
      brighter image means that the signal-to-noise ratio is greater.

      [bundle.tnl.jpg] Right: Artist's sketch shows how a capillary lens or
      concentrator will concentrate X-rays on a small detector (yellow
      square). In an actual unit, the detector would be 1 to 2 meters (3.3 to
      6.6 ft) behind the lens. Links to 1200x200-pixel, 81KB JPG.

      Up to half the X-ray energy may be absorbed by the capillary
      concentrator or lens, but no optical system passes all of the energy
      that arrives at the aperture.

   Test flight

      The technology of capillary optics is relatively new, having been
      conceived in the Former USSR in the 1980s.

      "Any new technology takes a while to become commonplace," Joy said.
      That is starting to happen, and NASA/Marshall is working with various
      companies to encourage development of X-ray capillary optics.

   Early detection

      Somewhat like the large condenser lens in front of a slide projector's
      lamp, capillary optics can capture the X-rays from a wide angle and
      concentrate them into a narrow beam aimed at the center of the crystal
      being studied. This produces a brighter dot pattern in a shorter period
      time, thus helping scientists deduce the molecular structure faster and
      with less uncertainty.

      Finally, capillary optics can also be used to produce sharper images in
      medical X-rays. Medical X-rays are really shadow pictures made by
      projecting the X-rays through a patient's body and looking, for
      example, for dense shadows (which appear white in the negative film)
      that indicate potential tumors.

      A problem is that dense tissue will also scatter the X-rays. This
      scattering can blur the image of tumors when they are small and easiest
      to fight. Placing a capillary optic lens against the patient's skin can
      capture the X-rays as they leave the body and reduce the blurring,
      increasing the chances of early detection.

   [exit.tnl.jpg] Joy said that NASA/Marshall and SUNY are testing two
   prototype capillary "lenses." MSFC is planning to fly a test optic in
   late 1999 on a stratospheric balloon platform. An array of capillary
   lenses would concentrate X-rays onto a small detector about 2 meters
   (5.5 ft) behind the lens.

   "Any hard X-ray detector will work with it," he said. "It's kind of
   like a lens in a camera."

   lens to show the bundled nature of the fibers. Variations in brightness
   are normal and would be measured in calibration tests. Links to

   X-Ray Optical Systems, Inc. in Albany is the industry partner in this
   project.
   NASA's Microgravity Research Program sponsors the capillary X-ray
   optics work and other advanced technologies.

   Initially, capillary lenses won't be used to produce images.

   "These are basically concentrators," he continued. "They don't produce
   images in the conventional sense, so you want to use them for
   spectroscopy." That means studying the energy levels to understand more
   about what is powering a neutron star, supernova, or causing some other
   violent event.
