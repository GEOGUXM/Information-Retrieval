   Goals

             Provide a computational facility to support research conducted
                   at GFDL with emphasis on supercomputing and networked
                   desktop systems for developing, running, and analyzing
                   results from numerical models.

     Provide software tools for managing, manipulating, and
   visualizing large amounts of multi-dimensional data.

     Maintain systems which provide documentation and time-sensitive
   information to users, create products for presentation and
   publication, and communicate GFDL's accomplishments to
   other agencies and to the public.

   the best IT resources possible.
