      OCVA's annual conference is an excellent opportunity for individuals
      and organizations that serve the needs of victims of crime and abuse to
      receive training and information to improve skills and network with
      others in the field of victim services. OCVA's mission is to identify
      the opportunities and resources victims need in order to recover, and
      to facilitate the availability of those resources and opportunities in
      communities statewide. The annual conference is a reflection of that
      mission.

      The annual conference begins Tuesday October 23 with lunch and a
      keynote address. We are very pleased to have Attorney General Christine
      Gregoire as our keynote speaker. She will address the issues of
      bullying, school violence and the relationships to family violence.

      Plenary speaker Naomi Haines Griffin will speak on Wednesday morning on
      the issue of school age children and violence. She will also present a
      workshop following the plenary

      Starting Wednesday afternoon and continuing through Friday morning
      there will be be eleven workshops from which to choose. Presentation
      topics include: school violence, Deaconess' Child neglect project,
      sexual assault laws and advocacy, sex offender laws, recruiting and
      training advocates and advocacy skill building. Check our web page for
      updates.

      Workshops that will meet clinicians under contract to deliver sexual
      assault therapy will have access to meeting those requirements.
