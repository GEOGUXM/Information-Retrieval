   About Welfare Reform

   When President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work
   Opportunity Reconciliation Act in August 1996, he set into motion a
   dramatic shift from welfare benefits that support an entitlement
   program, to welfare benefits providing temporary assistance. With an
   emphasis on economic self-sufficiency and a "work-first" philosophy,
   the program ceases welfare as an open-ended entitlement through a
   five-year, lifetime limit.

   Realizing there would be economic challenges to implementing such a
   dramatic change, Congress created the Welfare-to-Work grant program to
   focus on the population of recipients with the most challenging
   barriers to employment and self-sufficiency.

   The California Legislature responded to the federal law, by creating
   the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs)
   program in August 1997. CalWORKs establishes welfare reform in
   California by imposing work participation requirements and time limits
   upon the receipt of aid. It also provides for welfare-to-work and
   supportive services for CalWORKs recipients.

   Several California state agencies are partnering to maximize resources
   and coordinate welfare reform services. Among the state agencies
   involved in the partnership are the Employment Development Department,
   the Department of Social Services, the Chancellor's Office of the
   California Community Colleges, the Department of Mental Health, and the
   Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs among others. Likewise, local
   area agencies, such as County Welfare Departments and Private Industry
   Councils, are partnering with businesses to provide services that meet
   local needs.

   As an example of such a partnership, San Francisco Works, known as SF
   Works, was created as a business sponsored welfare-to-work program.
   Combining the forces of large and small businesses and nonprofits, the
   goal of SF Works is to move 2,000 welfare recipients to work by the
   year 2000.

   In Los Angeles, the Welfare to Work Leadership is an organization
   comprised of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, the Los Angeles
   Business Advisors, Arco Foundation, the James Irvine Foundation and
   Community Partners. In an effort to promote programs aimed at moving
   welfare recipients into unsubsidized employment, the Leadership focuses
   on assisting the many business and business related organizations in
   the Los Angeles area.

   If welfare recipients are to successfully move into the workforce, they
   need jobs that will allow them to contribute in the workplace. As an
   employer, you are the most significant member of the partnership
   involved in meeting the challenge of welfare reform. Your cooperation
   is vital to the success of California's welfare-to-work programs. Your
   participation secures a brighter future for California's businesses and
   workers. Your commitment ensures a growing California economy.
