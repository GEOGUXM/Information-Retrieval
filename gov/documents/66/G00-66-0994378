                            Adopt an Iowa Soldier

   "Adopt an Iowa Soldier" connects Iowans with those in the U.S. Armed
   Forces serving in Operation Enduring Freedom. The project allows
   'adoptive' families to show support by sending messages and care
   packages to their 'adopted' soldiers.

   Due to security restrictions, the defense department will not release
   the names of individual service members. In order to match Iowans with
   those in the military, I'm encouraging Iowa families with loved ones
   serving in Operation Enduring Freedom to provide the names of those
   service members. I will then match service members with Iowans
   interested in sending care packages as names become available.
   'Adoptive' families will be given guidelines for sending care packages
   once they are matched with a service member. Suggested items include
   magazines, Iowa newspapers, paperback books, CDs, audio tapes, calling
   cards, non-perishable snacks, juice boxes and toiletries. Clothing is
   not recommended.
