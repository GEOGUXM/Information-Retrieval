   The National Cancer Act, signed into law on December 23, 1971, by
   President Richard M. Nixon, mobilized the country's resources to make
   the "conquest of cancer a national crusade." Although the biology of
   the more than 100 types of cancers has proven far more complex than
   imagined at that time, the original vision of the legislators - to
   create a broad-reaching national program that would accelerate the pace
   of cancer research and its translation into treatments and prevention
   for cancer patients - has been largely realized as the 21st century
   approaches.

   The Act granted special authorities to the National Cancer Institute
   (NCI) and its director to spearhead the Nation's fight against cancer
   through the development of a National Cancer Program.

   Key provisions of the Act include:

     Establishment of a National Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB), whose 18
   scientific and lay members are appointed by the President to advise NCI
   on major initiatives against cancer.

     Creation of the President's Cancer Panel, a three-member panel of
   experts, including a consumer, who independently appraise the progress
   of the national program and submit an annual report directly to the
   President.

     Bypass budget authority for NCI, which enables the Institute to
   "bypass" traditional budgetary mechanisms and submit a budget directly
   to the President without approval from either the National Institutes
   of Health (NIH) or the Department of Health and Human Service.

     Broad authority for the NCI director, a presidential appointee, to
   develop and carry out - in consultation with the NCAB - the many
   compelling and competing priorities of the Nation's cancer research
   enterprise. The NCI director has the authority, for example, to create
   new cancer centers and personnel training programs, to appoint advisory
   committees to explore new research opportunities, to award research
   grants, and to expand the physical plant at the NIH, as well as cancer
   research facilities across the country. [endmark.gif]
