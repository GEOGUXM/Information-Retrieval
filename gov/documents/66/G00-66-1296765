Average Cumulative Profile Throughout the Hurricane Season

     The following figures and tables describe the progress of a typical
     hurricane season in terms of the total number of tropical systems
     and hurricanes produced throughout the year in the Atlantic and East
     Pacific basins.
     In the figures, curves represent the average cumulative production
     of all named tropical systems, all hurricanes, and those hurricanes
     which were category 3 or stronger in those basins.
     For example, by the beginning of September in an average year we
     would expect to have had four named systems, two of which would be
     hurricanes and one of which would be of category 3 or greater in
     strength.
     The tables list benchmark dates when a given number of tropical
     systems, hurricanes, or category 3 storms should have been
     generated.
