                   Use Your Military Experience and Training (UMET)

                      If you are a servicemember or veteran looking for a civilian job, you
   should know that, depending on your occupational area, you may need a
   license or certificate in order to obtain a job in the civilian work
   force.

   This web site, UMET, is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor's
   Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS), to make it easier for
   current and former military personnel to obtain the licenses and
   certifications they need to practice in the civilian work force.
