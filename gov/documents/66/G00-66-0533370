   Regulations Cases Questions & Answers

   The DOE has established procedures that govern the resolution of
   questions concerning the eligibility of individuals who are employed by
   or applicants for employment with DOE contractors, agents, and DOE
   access permittees; individuals who are DOE employees or applicants for
   DOE employment; and other persons designated by the Secretary of Energy
   for access to classified matter or special nuclear material. (This
   access authorization is commonly referred to as a security clearance.)
   These procedures are codified in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 710.
   Subpart A provides an opportunity for hearing and administrative review
   in cases when it is determined that questions concerning an
   individual's eligibility for access authorization cannot be favorably
   resolved by interview or other action.

   The Department of Defense has issued an Interim Final Rule that
   promulgates uniform adjudicative guidelines for all Federal agencies.
   These guidelines are established for all Federal government civilian
   and military personnel, consultants, contractors, employees of
   contractors, and other individuals who require access to classified
   information. They apply to persons being considered for initial or
   continued eligibility for access to classified information, and are to
   be used by government departments and agencies in all final clearance
   determinations. The Interim Final Rule is effective March 24, 1998. To
