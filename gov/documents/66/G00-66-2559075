  US CMS Project Review

    DOE/NSF Baseline Review of the US CMS Detector Project: May 19-22, 1998

   Note: users experiencing difficulty downloading PowerPoint files via
       the web may need to use the ftp links included below. The
       PowerPoint files must be transferred as binary (or raw) data. Note
       also that the US CMS logo and banner in some of the PowerPoint
       files is an eps file with a 1-bit black & white preview which may
       look poor on a monitor but will print fine to a postscript printer.
       The Adobe pdf version of the presentations is generally smaller and
       easier to read and/or print than the postscript or the original
       PowerPoint verisons. The pdf version is the preferred format; the
       ps and ppt versions are included for completness.

  CMS Schedule

   [Note: This information is obsolete. This schedule information is
   replaced by the US CMS Project Planning files available above. - J.
   Hanlon, 18-Dec-96]

   The high-level CMS schedule and milestones for the experimental halls,
   magnet, and yoke have been extracted from CMS planning document
   "CMS/V23-26/06/96 MSP" (a Microsoft Project version 4 file) to a
   smaller Project file. It is these schedules and milestones which drive
   the fabrication, assembly, and installation schedules for the detector.

   The HCAL fabrication, assembly, installation, commission and test
   schedule for both the assembly and collision halls has been added to
   this extracted Project file, together with the schedule for ECAL and
   Tracker installation, commission and test.

   This Microsoft Project file is available below in a variety of formats.
   The schedule is available in gif and postscript formats, and the
   Project file itself is available in native mpp or interchange mpx
   format.
     * Experimantal hall, magnet, and yoke schedule: gif or ps
     * HCAL schedule, with ECAL and Tracker installation schedule: gif or
       ps
     * Microsoft Project file: mpp (binary) or mpx (ascii)
