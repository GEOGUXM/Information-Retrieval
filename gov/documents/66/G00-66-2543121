   WILMINGTON, DE - U. S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. announced today his
   year 2002 nominations to the U.S. Service Academies. After an intensive
   review process of qualified students, Senator Biden nominated three
   principal nominees - or top candidates - who will be offered academy
   appointments should they meet all medical, physical and academic
   requirements. I am proud to nominate these gifted young men and women
   to the U.S. Service Academies, said Biden. Qualifying for this
   nomination is an accomplishment in and of itself. The next few years
   will be difficult academically, mentally and physically but I am
   certain that these young men and women will rise to the challenge and
   emerge as strong leaders and first-rate officers. Senator Bidens three
