   Agency Management
        __________________________________________________________________

      This key area provides leadership that spans the organization and
      across the Strategic Enterprises by developing overall NASA
      strategyÂ—the "what, why, and for whom" of the Agency.

      Composed of a diverse group of men and women, the Agency does not
      accomplish its mission alone, but in partnership with large and small
      contractors, members of the academic community, other Federal, State,
      and local agencies, and other space agencies from nations around the
      globe. Together, these entities form a comprehensive, highly skilled
      team that is dedicated to providing high-quality, technologically
      superior products and services to its customers.

      NASA's highly skilled workforce, including scientists, engineers,
      technicians, and administrative and support professionals, and our
      world-class facilities represent the backbone of the Nation's civil
      research and development capabilities in aeronautics and space.

      NASA Headquarters Agency Management is the external focal point for
      accountability and communication for NASA, and functions as a liaison
      between NASA and its many customers. Here, budget integration,
      long-term investment strategy, NASA policy and standards, and Agency
      functional leadership are carried out.
