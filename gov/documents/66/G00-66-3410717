Prior Solicitation

   The Constituency Outreach and Education Program is a 5-year
   communications initiative of NIMH that enlists Outreach Partners in
   every State and the District of Columbia, to help close the gap between
   mental health research and practice and reduce the stigma of mental
   illness. Currently, the Program has enlisted 51 Outreach Partners
   representing every State and the District of Columbia. There are no
   plans to solicit additional Partners at this time.

   To learn more about our prior application and selection process, you
   are invited to visit our Request for Applications information page.
