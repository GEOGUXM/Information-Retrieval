   202.414.6921 www.ofheo.gov OFHEO ANNOUNCES FINAL RULE ON FLOOD
   INSURANCE (Revised 12/18/01 to include language as printed in Federal
   Register) WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Armando Falcon, Jr., Director of the
   Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), safety and
   soundness regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises),
   has sent a final rule on flood insurance to the Federal Register. The
   rule codifies OFHEO's authority to enforce statutory requirements to
   ensure the Enterprises maintain procedures to comply with requirements
   of the National Flood Insurance Program under the Federal Emergency
   Management Agency (FEMA). The rule reiterates the Federal statutory
   scheme including the availablility of civil money penalties if the
   Enterprises violate national flood insurance requirements. OFHEO's
   oversight of the Enterprises' conduct is a matter of routine
   supervisory review. The promulgation of the new rule in no way implies
   any legal deficiency in compliance or inadequacy of existing policies
   or practices of the Enterprises. OFHEO published a Notice of Proposed
   Rulemaking for the flood insurance rule on September 12, 2001. Comments
   were received only from both Enterprises during the 30-day comment
   period and are posted on
