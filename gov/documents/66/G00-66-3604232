   SEARCH TIPS:
     * Use + to Require Words

       of the documents returned contain the word.
       Example search: Salmon +Pacific.
     * Use - to Exclude Words
       Put a minus sign (-) in front of a search word to make sure that
       NONE of the documents returned contain the word.
       Example search: Temperaure -buoy -satellite.
     * Use Boolean operators
       You can use the AND, OR, NOT, and AND NOT operators, and
       parentheses ( ) for grouping.
