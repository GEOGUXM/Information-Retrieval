   Michelson Interferometer

   LISA's detection of gravitational waves is based on the operation of a
   Michelson-type interferometer. In a Michelson interferometer, light
   from a laser is directed towards a beam splitter. The beam splitter
   acts as a partially reflecting mirror, so that part of the incoming
   laser light goes straight through, and part is reflected (Figure 1).
   The light going through the beam splitter reaches the object labeled
   Mass 1 where it is reflected back towards the beam splitter. Part of
   the light reflected off of Mass 1 is reflected by the beam splitter and
   hits the detector (Figure 2). The light reaching the beamsplitter that
   reflects towards Mass 2 is likewise reflected back towards the beam
   splitter. At the beam splitter, part of the light reflected from Mass 2
   passes straight through towards the detector (Figure 3). (The part of
   this light that is reflected back towards the laser is not used).

   Michelson Interferometer So on the detector there are two light beams,
   one that was reflected off Mass 1 and one reflected off Mass 2. The
   detector converts the combination of the two light beams into an
   electrical signal. Because of the way light beams interact, the output
   of the detector depends on the difference in the distances the two
   light beams have traveled. Because the two light beams travel the same
   distance from the laser to the beam splitter, and from the beam
   splitter to the detector, the detector output depends on the difference
   of length L1 (from the beam splitter to Mass 1) and L2 (from the beam
   splitter to Mass 2). If L1 and L2 are exactly the same, then the two
   light beams interact on the detector to make a bright spot on the
   detector which gives a maximum electrical signal. If the difference in
   L1 and L2 is one-quarter of the wavelength of the laser light, then the
   two light beams will cancel each other out on the detector, and the
   detector output will be a minimum. Changes in the distance L1 and L2
   will thus produce a variable electrical output of the detector.

   Since the output of the interferometer depends on changes of the scale
   of the laser wavelength, and because laser wavelengths are very small
   (about 1 micrometer, or about 0.0001 inches), the interferometer is a
   very sensitive device for measuring changes in length. This is exactly
   what is needed to detect gravitational waves, since gravitational waves
   passing by the interferometer have the effect of causing very small
   changes in the distances between proof masses.

   The main challenge for LISA is not achieving the necessary performance
   of the interferometer, but in making sure that the distance between
   test masses are changed ONLY by gravitational waves, and not by other
   things. If the proof masses were just left alone in orbit around the
   sun, light and other particles emitted by the sun would push on the
   proof masses and cause much larger distance changes than the
   gravitational waves would.

   Each of the three LISA spacecraft is designed to carefully isolate the
   proof masses from external (and internal!) disturbing forces. Each
   spacecraft contains an instrument, formed by two optical assemblies.
   Each instrument can act as the laser/beamsplitter/detector portion of a
   Michelson interferometer. Then the other spacecraft act as the distance
   test masses (like Mass 1 and Mass 2 in the figure). The light from the
   spacecraft acting as the laser/beamsplitter/detector sends out laser
   beams to the other two spacecraft. Since they are so far away, the two
   distant spacecraft do not simply reflect the light, but instead detect
   the received light and transmit a new beam from their own on-board
   lasers. Thus the two spacecraft performing the roles of Mass 1 and Mass
   2 act as reflecting mirrors.
