   MySQL is a relational database system that has the follwing basic
   features:
     * Understands standard SQL syntax.
     * Many clients can work simultaneously.
     * Extensive documentation is available.
     * Web access to all data.
     * Variety of API is available:
          + PHP API to write dynamic Web pages that access databases.
          + Perl API: simple scripting language to fill and read
            databases.
          + C API based on client library included in the MySQL
            distribution.
          + Mysql++: simpler C++ API to make working as easy as with STL
            containers.
     * Multi level security system: priviliges can be specified at user,
       db, host, tables, and column level.

   MySQL is installed at U.S. Atlas Tier 1 Facility Linux machines at
   /afs/usatlas.bnl.gov/offline/external/mysql . It is recommended to use
   the binaries of the latest stable MySQL version at
   /afs/usatlas.bnl.gov/offline/external/mysql/current/bin.

   MySQL is free software and can be easily downloaded to a Linux computer
   with the following procedure:
     * download the latest stable source distribution from MySQL website.
       The filenames are such as mysql-version.tar.gz
     * unpack it and move to resulted directory
       cd mysql-version
     * follow instructions of INSTALL and README files. To install
       binaries into /usr/local directory it is usually sufficient to run
       the following commands:
          + .configure --prefix=/usr/local
          + make
          + make install
     * The server can be started with command safe_mysqld
     * mysqladmin utility is useful for administrative operations.
     * mysqldump utility allows easy database copying between servers.

   U.S. ATLAS Tier 1 MySQL servers are read opened, so anybody can access
   them with any username and null password (click on the link to get more
