  Why?

     Clouds are important to climate because they strongly modulate
     incoming solar and outgoing thermal radiation. Clouds, as the source
     of precipitation, are also a key element in the hydrologic cycle.
     Clouds are currently under intense scrutiny by researchers to gain a
     better understanding of their role in our environment. This
     knowledge is needed for better predictions of climate change, to
     guide policy in ameliorating or adjusting to change, and to provide
     better stewardship of our depleting water resources.

     Aerosol particles are also important to climate, directly by
     scattering light and indirectly by serving as cloud condensation
     nuclei. Aerosol particles in high concentrations are
     health-endangering pollutants, and in lower concentrations also aid
     air quality observations as indicators of the movement and dilution
     of other pollutants.

     Lidar can reveal many characteristics of cloud and aerosol particles
     using light backscattered from them.

  Cloud Research

     Simple geometrical properties of clouds, such as fractional cover
     and cloud boundaries, are fundamental to radiative transfer.
     Microphysical parameters, such as phase (ice or water) and particle
     size, are also significant. Our lidar division has been developing
     novel methods to measure some of these basic cloud properties. Some
     methods utilize the particular attributes of infrared-wavelength
     lidar to infer average drop size and to discriminate between water
     and ice particles. Other methods use simultaneous lidar and radar
     measurements for profiling mean size, water content, and number
     density in cirrus clouds. The latter method is being extended to
     water clouds. We are also investigating the information content in
     Doppler lidar measurements of ice particle vertical motions.

     Another phenomenon under study is how often ice crystals orient with
     the long axis in the horizontal. Compared to random orientation,
     this alters radiative transfer and complicates interpretation of the
     lidar signal. Another topic of interest is the complementary nature
     of lidar and radar in providing a more complete description of cloud
     boundaries than either instrument alone.

     We apply these new methods, along with more traditional lidar
     techniques, in field campaigns to study cloud characteristics. These
     results eventually guide development of computer models for
     understanding and predicting climate.

     Numerical modeling rounds out the cloud research within our
     division. By including detailed microphysics in sophisticated
     dynamics models, the behavior of drops, precipitation, and aerosol
     particles in stratiform clouds are better simulated, providing
     improved understanding of cloud evolution, drizzle formation, cloud
     processing of aerosol, and cloud radiative properties.

  Aerosol Research

     Stratospheric aerosol particles directly effect radiative transfer
     and can contribute to depletion of the ozone shield. Our lidars have
     observed enhancement of stratospheric particles from volcanic
     eruptions, and we developed a new two-lidar technique to profile the
     mean particle size.

     Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) play a major role in cloud
     formation. We have conceived a number of aerosol retrieval methods
     to determine the fraction of aerosols that are hygroscopic.
