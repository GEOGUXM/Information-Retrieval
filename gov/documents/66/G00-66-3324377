   [uchoose.gif] Did you know that, by displaying a personalized message
   on your license plate, you can help protect California's wonderful
   natural resources?

         By purchasing from the Department of Motor Vehicles an
   environmental license plate - an official California plate displaying
   letters and numbers that you choose, such as your name, favorite sports
   team, or other message - you can proudly make a clever statement to
   others on the road, while also helping to fund top priority natural
   resource programs.

         For over a quarter century, Californians have done just that and,
   as a result, have generously - and voluntarily - provided over $500
   million for important environmental and natural resource programs.

         The wide variety of programs and activities throughout California
   that benefit from the revenues generated include:

     * the protection of threatened and endangered plants and animals;
     * the enhancement and restoration of fish and wildlife habitat at key
       locations around the state;
     * the purchase and restoration of sensitive natural areas for the
       California State Park System and for local and regional parks;
     * the reduction of soil erosion and the discharge of sediment into
       Lake Tahoe, including the restoration of disturbed wetlands and
       sensitive stream areas;
     * a wide variety of environmental education programs that actively
       involve schools, wildlife areas, community groups, and other public
       and private partners across California.
                     ___________________________________

         Any California driver can make their contribution to these
   important environmental efforts by obtaining an environmental license
   plate. This is done when one registers, re-registers, or transfers the
   registration of a car, truck, motorcycle, or trailer with the
   Department of Motor Vehicles. You simply indicate your desire to get an
   official environmental license plate.

         In addition to the routine costs of registration, the following
   costs apply to environmental license plates:

     * First time for personalized plate - $41
     * Renewal of current personalized plate - $25
     * Duplicate plates (both front and back of vehicle) - $31
     * Transfer (existing environmental license plate to a different
       vehicle) - $20

         Drivers who already have an environmental license plate on their
   car, truck, or trailer can go one step further for California's natural
   resources by obtaining one of the State's beautiful environmental
   special interest license plates. By doing so, one's personal message
   can appear in the unique and picturesque setting of one of the
   specialty plates, such as Yosemite and Lake Tahoe.

   Government" pages of your telephone book.

         The Environmental License Plate Program is a cooperative effort
   between the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Resources Agency, and the
   California Legislature. The program was first created under the
   Marks-Badham Environmental Protection and Research Act of 1970. Since
   1979, authority for the allocation of Environmental License Plate
   revenues for projects and activities consistent with the environmental
   purposes of the law has rested with the Secretary for Resources.
