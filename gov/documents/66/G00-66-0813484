                      For Immediate Release, 1/29/2002
                 Enron = Why We Need Campaign Finance Reform

     In an editorial featured on the progressive web site Common Dreams
    today, Rep. Sanders cited the Enron scandal as exhibit #1 in the case
   favoring the need for immediate campaign reform. The now-defunct energy
   giant dolled out some $6 million in campaign contributions at the same
                     time that its business was failing.

       Sanders called Enron a poster child of how a group of powerful
    corporate leaders come to exert enormous clout over elected officials
        and get the rules changed in their favor. Last year, the Bush
    administration put forward a so-called economic stimulus package that
         would have rewarded Enron with $254 million in tax rebates.

    Sanders also highlights Enrons connection to President Bushs campaign
       and the extent of the political clout of Enrons auditor Arthur
   Anderson. Read the full text of Rep. Sanders article on Common Dreams.
