                    OEBAM: A DESCRIPTION  AND ITS MISSION

   Welcome to the Office of Executive Budgeting and Assistance
   Management's (OEBAM) home page. Our goal is to provide general
   information on what we do, and to facilitate access to the program
   areas for which we are responsible. In addition to providing you with
   direct access to electronically stored information, we hope to provide
   you with links to other related sites that can be of assistance.

   OEBAM is located within the Office of the Chief Financial Officer and
   Assistant Secretary for Administration and is made up of two
   sub-entities -- the Office of Executive Budgeting (OEB) and the Office
   of Executive Assistance Management (OEAM).    OEBAM is responsible for
   a wide variety of administrative functions, including developing and
   managing the budget for the Office of the Secretary and other
   Department of Commerce (DoC) offices, establishing and implementing DoC
   policies and procedures, and providing operational support for grants
   management, travel management, forms and records management, and
   advisory committees.  In addition, OEBAM is responsible for carrying
   out the DoC's responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act
   (FOIA) and Privacy Act and administering the department-wide Post
   Secondary Internship Program.
