      The infrared program is geared primarily towards using infrared
      radiation to probe the electronic and vibrational properties of solids.
      The reflectance of a material is a complex quantity, with an amplitude
      and a phase. During a typical experiment, we only measure the reflected
      amplitude of the radiation. However, if the reflectance is measured
      over a wide enough range, then it is possible using the Kramers-Kronig
      relations to calculate the phase: once the amplitude and phase are
      known, then other optical response functions may be calculated,
      specifically the real part of the complex conductivity.

      In the past I have used infrared techniques to examine a wide variety
      of materials, including:

   [sumbul1a.gif] Organic conductors (1D & 2D)
   [sumbul1a.gif] charge-density wave systems
   [sumbul1a.gif] C[60] single crystals
   [sumbul1a.gif] Magnetic insulators
   [sumbul1a.gif] Quasiperiodic systems and their approximant phases
   [sumbul1a.gif] Collosal magnetoresistance materials
   [sumbul1a.gif] High-temperature superconductors

      The materials that I am presently looking at are the so-called "bad
      metals", which would characterize most of the transition metal oxides
      which are not insulators.

      The unconventional conductivity and superconductivity of many of the
      bad metals is thought to involve collective excitations which typically
      occur at very low energies, either in the microwave region or in the
      very far infrared. The low-energy part of the infrared spectrum, or the
      far infrared, is a region where conventional infrared sources (i.e.,
      globar and Hg arc lamps) are very weak. One of the programs here at
      Brookhaven National Laboratory is to use the National Synchrotron Light
      Source as a source of infrared radiation. At long wavelengths, it may
      be possible to realize an advantage in brightness of several orders of
      magnitude over a conventional infrared source; this is especially
      useful when examining small samples. My current projects involve
      examining optical properties of the colossal magnetoresistance
      materials La[1-x]Ca[x]MnO[3], the high-temperature superconductor
      YBa[2]Cu[3]O[6+x], as well as other transition metal oxides. Many of
      these materials can now be grown as single crystals, so the polarized
      light may be used to probe along specific crystalline axes in
      anisotropic materials. Optical properties have provided a wealth of
      information about the electrodynamics of the oxide materials, both in
      the normal state, and (where it occurs) in the superconducting state as
      well, and will probably be one of the keys to understanding the unusual
      behaviour of these systems.

      We are also interested in optical properties of ultra-thin films of Pb
      and in solvated electron systems. This type of experiment blends
      ultra-high vacuum, low temperature, and optical techniques to grow a
      film in situ at cryogenic temperatures and measure the optical
      properties simultaneously. These studies are providing information
      about the nature of transport in granular systems.
