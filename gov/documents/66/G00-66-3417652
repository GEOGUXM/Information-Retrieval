                      Project Schedule | Presidential Records Act Overview

   Our web site privacy policy is:

   We consider "personally identifying information" to be: your name or a
   unique identifier (such as an IP address), your e-mail address, your
   mailing address, your telephone number, and any financial information
   relating to your or your accounts that you may provide us.

   We do not use "cookies."

   Our system collects server log data which will include your IP address,
   your domain name, the type of browser and operating system you used,
   the pages you viewed, search requests, in some cases data you submitted
   via web forms, and, if you linked to our site from another web site,
   that web site's address. After three months from the time of
   collection, we aggregate this data and use it for statistical purposes.
   This is how we discover how many "hits" our site received. The
   aggregated data helps us to ascertain, for example, the volume of our
   web site users' interest in portions of our web site, and to help us
   understand how to improve the navigation and content of our web site.

   Personally identifying information that you provide by email or web
   forms will be used only for such purposes as are described at the point
   of collection (for example on a web form), such as to send information
   or products to you, or to respond to your questions or comments. If you
   provide contact information, NARA staff or its contractors may contact
   you to clarify your comment or question, or to learn about your level
   of customer satisfaction with our services.

   We do not sell any personal information to third parties. We may
   transfer personal information to a third party only in the following
   cases:
     * To a bank or United States Department of the Treasury account,
       which must receive payment for a transaction that you initiated;
     * To a company that is contracted to assist us with specific
       services, including electronic commerce or donations, and which
       agrees not to sell or use personal information for other purposes;
     * To legal authorities if we suspect that you are attempting to
       change or otherwise damage this web site, or you are using it in
       violation of Federal or local laws;
     * To Congress or a court in response to a subpoena.

   Although questions, comments, and other communications that we receive
   generally are not retained as permanent records, please note that it is
   possible that any mailelectronic or paperthat we (or any Federal
   agency, for that matter) receive could become part of the permanent
   record of the agency, if the mail is part of materials that are
   scheduled for permanent retention.
