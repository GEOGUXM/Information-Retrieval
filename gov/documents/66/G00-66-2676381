   [foodpic.gif] Radionuclides released during operations at the Hanford
   Site could contaminate food and farm products grown nearby. Therefore,
   a variety of food and farm product samples are collected and analyzed
   at selected locations around the site. Most samples are collected from
   locations generally downwind or downstream from the site. Other samples
   are collected from upwind and distant locations for comparison.

   Radionuclide levels in agricultural products occur at levels below the
   limit of detection in most farm products grown around the Hanford Site.
   Measurable levels of man-made radioactivity were not detected in
   vegetable and fruit samples collected in 1998.

   [food.jpg] Milk is an important food to monitor because radionuclides
   deposited on grass or alfalfa can result in increased radioactivity in
   milk. Levels of radionuclides in milk samples collected around the
   Hanford Site have decreased or remained constant in recent years at all
   routine sampling locations. Current concentrations are very low and do
   not significantly contribute to human dose.

   More information on food and farm product surveillance is available in
   the Hanford Site 2000 Environmental Report, Section 4.4.
