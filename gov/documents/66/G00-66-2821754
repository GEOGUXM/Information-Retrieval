                 ABOUT THE INFLUENZA SEQUENCE DATABASE (ISD)

    An introduction to this web site, and the people responsible for its
                                development.

   The Influenza Sequence Database is located at Los Alamos National
   Laboratory in the Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group (T-10).

   The Influenza Sequence Database is a curated database of nucleotide and
   amino acid sequences. It is intended to provide the research community
   with easy sequence deposit and retrieval capabilities, together with
   tools tailored, in particular, to the analysis of hemagglutinin and
   neuraminidase sequences. Care has been taken to remove redundant
   sequences and to fill in missing field data (see Curation).

   Our project began in the spring of 1998; the database now holds all
   influenza A, B, and C sequences that have been published in GenBank, as
   well as a growing number of unpublished sequences. Researchers
   interested in depositing any of their unpublished sequences directly
   into the ISD are invited to contact the Manager, Catherine Macken, at
   cmacken@lanl.gov.

   The search page provides Basic and Advanced searches as well as two
   specialized functions called Region and Prosite search. Region search
   is an Advanced search with the additional feature of allowing the user
   to prune returned sequences to a region of interest. Region search is
   based on prealigned sequences, and hence can be used to download
   alignments. (Currently available for Influenza A & B). Prosite search
   is another Advanced search, applicable to protein sequences only, with
   the additional feature of identifying "prosite" patterns. Prosite
   search can be used to color-code glycosylation sites, CTL epitopes, or
   other patterns of interest onto pre-aligned protein sequences.
   (Currently available for Influenza A & B).

   Analytical tools include structure mapping of hemagglutinin, a tool
   that allows the user to select and highlight residues on a dynamic
   visualization of the crystal structure of H3 hemagglutinin, using
   RASMOL. Another tool translates accession numbers on a user-supplied
   phylogenetic tree into full or abbreviated strain names. More tools are
   in the development stage. Users of the database are encouraged to
   contact us with suggestions for new tools that would be of general
   interest.

   We provide many links to other sites, including Genbank, Medline and
   the Protein Databank (for retrieval of structural records).
