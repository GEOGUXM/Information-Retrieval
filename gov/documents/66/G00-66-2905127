                                    Mission

   The Great Lakes Science Center is dedicated to providing scientific
   information for the management of our nation's biological resources.
   The Center is headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and has biological
   stations and research vessels located throughout the Great Lakes Basin.
   The precursor to the current Center's programs began in 1927 when
   investigations of the collapse of the Lake Erie cisco population were
   initiated by the Center's first director, Dr. John Van Oosten. Our
   research spans a range of studies including fish populations and
   communities, aquatic habitats, terrestrial ecology, nearshore and
   coastal communities and the biological processes that occur in this
   complex ecosystem of the Great Lakes.

   The Center's mission is presented along with the missions of the
   Biological Resources Division, the U.S. Geological Survey, and U.S.
   Department of the Interior to show the hierarchical relationships
   within the National objectives for the wise use of our natural
   resources.

                                    History

   The Great Lakes Science Center traces its beginnings to 1871 when
   Congress, by joint resolution, established the United States Fish
   Commission and charged it with responsibility for investigations and
   inquiries concerning the supply of food fishes of the coasts and lakes
   of the United States and the determination of protective, prohibitory,
   or precautionary measures to be adopted. Initial investigations began
   in 1871 in Lake Michigan - the Lake with the longest shoreline within
   the United States and the largest number of fisheries. The U.S. Fish
   and Wildlife Service and its two Bureaus, the Bureau of Commercial
   Fisheries and the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife evolved from
   these early investigations.

   Activities of the Bureau in the Great Lakes and Central Region prior to
   1920 were limited to infrequent surveys, mostly statistical, of the
   fisheries of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River system and to
   the operation of fish-cultural stations. The earliest continuing work
   on the Great Lakes began in 1920 when the Bureau began supporting the
   research of Dr. Walter N. Koelz and Dr. John Van Oosten at the
   University of Michigan. These early studies focused on the taxonomy and
   life histories of coregonids (whitefishes, ciscoes, chubs).

   The current Great Lakes Science Center was established in 1927 as the
   Great Lakes Biological Laboratory, with John Van Oosten as its
   Director. This program was started as a consequence of the furor
   generated by the collapse of the cisco fishery in Lake Erie in 1925.

   The Great Lakes Science Center has always resided in the Department of
   Interior but has changed bureaus and undergone several name changes
   over the last half century. The chronology is outlined below.

   U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Fisheries, 1927-1939

   The Great Lakes fishery investigations are led by Dr. John Van Oosten
   in response to problems with the Lake Erie cisco fishery.  These
   investigations formed the early beginnings of what would become the
   Great Lakes Science Center.

  The Great Lakes Science Center: Early Studies within the Dept. of Interior
  1939-1956

   The establishment of the Great Lakes Biological Laboratory in 1927,
   with John Van Oosten as its Director, was a consequence of the furor
   generated by the collapse of the cisco fishery in Lake Erie in 1925.
   Subsequent crises have dominated the history of the Laboratory as
   described by Dr. Ralph Hile, editor and fishery biologist:

     "Born in the crisis arising from the disappearance of the Lake Erie
     cisco, Great Lakes Fishery Investigations has forever since
     experienced the varying fortunes that inevitably befall an
     organization whose very life depends on the existence of emergencies
     that cry for attention. Seldom has money been adequate to the task
     assigned; commonly it was supplemented by funds from State and
     private agencies interested in particular problems; never until most
     recently could long-term researches [sic] be set up that would
     contribute to a fundamental understanding of the fish populations
     and of the factors that control their level of productivity."

   The support of biological research on the Great Lakes first approached
   a level consistent with bare minimal needs in 1950 after the most
   devastating of all disasters, the destruction of major fisheries of the
   upper Great Lakes by the parasitic sea lamprey, was well advanced.
   Other biological research grew more slowly, but initial studies were
   started in new areas of research and for the first time continuing
   investigations of selected fisheries became possible.

   The sea lamprey, a marine species that gained access to the upper Great
   Lakes after the Welland Canal was built around Niagara Falls, spread
   throughout the Great Lakes during the 1940s and destroyed the lake
   trout and lake whitefish commercial fisheries. We tested over 4,000
   chemicals to find one to destroy the lamprey when they were most
   vulnerable--as larvae in tributaries. This compound, TFM
   (3-trifluromethyl-4-nitrophenol), was found in 1958 and is still used
   for lamprey control. Other studies initiated during the 1950s were on
   the biology and population dynamics of commercially important species,
   on the restoration of lake trout, and on the limnology of the Great
   Lakes.

   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Commercial Fisheries,
   1956-1970

       In1956, the Bureau of Fisheries and the Bureau of Biological Survey
   were separated again.  The new Fish and Wildlife Act creates the United
   States Fish and Wildlife Service, including two Bureaus: the Bureau of
   Commercial Fisheries, the descendant of the original U.S. Fish
   Commission, of which the Center is part, and the Bureau of Sport
   Fisheries and Wildlife. Through 1958, the Centerâ€™s program is still
   referred to as Great Lakes Fishery Investigations.  In 1959, the Center
   began using the name, Great Lakes Biological Laboratory in its annual
   Program and Progress report.

        In 1965, the center moved to its newly constructed headquarters on
   the North Campus of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. An active
   limnology program focused on problems caused by pollution in Lake Erie
   took place during this decade. The decline of Hexagenia, a pollution
   intolerant benthic invertebrate, and the ionic release of high
   concentrations of chemicals from sediment in the anaerobic hypolimnion
   of Lake Erie were documented. Seasonal changes in nitrate, phosphate,
   and silica concentrations were identified as the driving force behind
   summer blooms of blue-green algae in the Western Basin of Lake Erie.
   The decision to control phosphate rather than nitrate discharge into
   the Lake was based on our finding that some blue-green algae are able
   to fix atmospheric nitrogen in the absence of dissolved nitrogen and
   were thriving in the nitrate and silica depleted but phosphate-rich
   summer waters of Lake Erie. Other accomplishments of the laboratory in
   the 1960s included its role in drastically reducing the sea lamprey
   population and in obtaining data on DDT residues in fish, which served
   as evidence supporting the nationwide ban on the use of DDT in 1972.
   Chemists also found that DDT accumulated in fatty tissues of fish, and
   removal of fat before cooking significantly reduced DDT concentrations
   in serving portions. In response to illness and death from botulism in
   smoked fish, microbiologists developed a method for preparing smoked
   fish that deterred Botulinum growth. During the heyday of the alewife
   crises, alewife were harvested and used as food for mink and chickens,
   the animals became sick on this diet because alewife contain the enzyme
   thiaminase which destroyed the B-vitamin thiamine in the animals.
   Researchers at the Center were able to inactivate thiaminase with heat
   and showed that cooking alewives before use as animal food resolved the
   problem.

  Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife

   In 1970, under Executive Order 11564, President Richard M. Nixon
   established the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
   as part of the Department of Commerce.  The new organization is
   directed toward a better understanding of the Nationâ€™s living marine
   resources, the environment in which they are found, and the interaction
   between the two.  The Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (BCF) is
   transferred to NOAA on October 3rd and is renamed the National Marine
   Fisheries Service.  The Department of the Interior retained the
   functions related to certain Great Lakes fisheries, and the Center was
   transferred from the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries to the Bureau of
   Sport Fisheries and Wildlife in accordance with Presidentâ€™s
   reorganization plan.  In addition, in 1970, the Center was renamed the
   Great Lakes Fishery Laboratory.

   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1974-1993

   In 1974, the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, which remained in
   the Department of the Interior, is renamed by an act of Congress in
   April 1974 (16 U.S.C. 742b) as the United States Fish and Wildlife
   Service.   In 1986, the Center was renamed as the National Fisheries
   Center--Great Lakes.  In 1987, the Center became know as the National
   Fisheries Research Center--Great Lakes

  National Biological Service

   In 1993, the Center was transferred to the newly created National
   Biological Survey (which was renamed National Biological Service in
   1995) and renamed the Great Lakes Center. In 1994 it was renamed again
   as the Great Lakes Science Center.  As part of the reorganization, six
   research scientists from the Great Lakes cluster parks of the National
   Park Service were transferred to the Center. They (a fishery scientist
   at Voyageurs, a plant ecologist at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore,
   and four scientists and two laboratory technicians at Indiana Dunes
   National Lakeshore) remain at their stations and continue to work on
   problems in national parks throughout the Great Lakes system. Current
   investigations include endangered species, contaminants, community
   ecology, exotic species control, landscape ecology, fire ecology,
   paleoecology, and fishery sciences.

   The Center, as a result of its data gathering in the 1970's and 80's,
   has played a key role in developing a technical bases for interagency
   management of the walleye in Lake Erie, and has made important
   contributions toward understanding the biology and population dynamics
   of other major species necessary for effective fishery management.
   Restoration of naturally reproducing lake trout populations in all five
   Great Lakes is an especially important objective. Several studies are
   focused on evaluating the present quality of lake trout spawning
   habitats, and the way various strains of stocked lake trout perform
   under stress from contaminants, fishing, sea lamprey, predation, and
   other sources.

   Considerable effort has been expended since the 1970's to provide an
   empirical basis for evaluating the effects of navigation (particularly
   winter navigation) on Great Lakes fish and their habitat. Center
   biologists have been key figures in documenting the spread and
   devastation of the zebra mussel and providing vital information on its
   life history. Our staff is currently monitoring and gathering
   information on the natural history of the ruffe, another potentially
   disruptive non-native fish. Chemists have developed a way to predict
   from its structure which chemicals are potentially harmful and can
   distinguish between naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals in
   fish.
