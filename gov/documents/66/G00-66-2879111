   Vertical Rule

   The NIH Work and Family Life Center (WFLC) provides a variety of
   information and resource services on a walk-in basis at no cost to
   users. The cornerstone of these services is our library collection,
   which contains materials to enhance all of our other programs.

   Topic areas include:
     * personal development
     * professional and career development
     * work/life balance
     * families and parenting
     * elder care
     * health and wellness

   You can pick up pamphlets, brochures, training catalogs, and other
   materials on all of these topics in the resource center.

   Our books, audiotapes, and videotapes are available for loan to NIH
   employees. Bring your NIH ID to receive a WFLC library card, and
   explore the collection.

   Our new circulation system does require that you have a lending card.
   If you have not signed up for one yet, you can either stop by the WFLC,
   fill out the form, and receive it on the spot; or you can fill out our
   form [PDF version or text version] and fax it back to us at
   301-480-0606. We will send your circulation card back to you via
   interoffice mail.

   On-Line Catalog

   The WFLC catalog is searchable online at
   http://wflc.od.nih.gov/cgi-bin/library/libsearch.cgi. You can use our
   index of subjects [PDF version and text version]. It will help
   structure your search.

   If you are not able to visit us in person, books may be requested
   through the catalog function or by e-mailing wflc@od.nih.gov directly,
   and sent to you via interoffice mail. You can return them via
   interoffice mail as well.

   Please keep in mind, however, that you do need a WFLC library card [PDF
   version or text version] in order to borrow
   books.
