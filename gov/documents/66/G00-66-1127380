                             Introduction to Browse

   Browse provides access to the catalogs and astronomical archives of the
   High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC) over
   the World-Wide Web. Catalogs include data from all astronomical
   regimes, but the emphasis of the archive is data from high energy
   astrophysics satellites. These satellites, launched by NASA and other
   space agencies, observe X rays and gamma rays from astronomical objects
   including stars, galaxies, supernova remnants, clusters of galaxies and
   active galactic nuclei. This document gives a brief description of how
   to use Browse.

   There are four different Browse interfaces:
     * Main Interface

        This interface is the main web interface to the archive. You can
                choose the missions and tables you want to query. You can
                also set up complex parameter queries or do
                name/coordinate searches in various coordinate
                systems/equinoxes with arbitrary search radii and plot
                query results using Java. Cross-correlations can be
                performed based on the results of a query.

     * Catalog Index Interface

        Lists all mission catalogs with links to appropriate HEASARC
                resources.

     * Batch Interface

        This is a set of Perl scripts that you can execute on remote Unix
                workstations to do multiple batch Object Name/Coordinates
                Searches without having to use a Web browser.

     * Cross-correlation Interface

        This interface allows you to cross-correlate full tables on radius
                or time.

   VizieR logo In addition to offering access to the catalogs and tables
   at the HEASARC, the Browse main interface supports transparent access
   to thousands of catalogs in VizieR maintained by the CDS in Strasbourg,
   France and mirrored at sites around the world. When VizieR tables are
   queried, links are provided wherever possible so that the user can
   switch to the VizieR query interface.

Quick Start

   The HEASARC Browse comprises several layers of Web pages starting from
   the launch page and providing successively more detailed access to the
   information resources of the HEASARC. A typical search for archival
   information looks something like the following:
     * Select the interface to use.
       Most users will use the main Browse interface. This interface
       allows you to choose missions and/or catalogs and search by
       coordinates, object name, or any other parameter in the table. The
       other interfaces will be discussed later in this document.
     * Select missions or catalogs to search.
       Each mission or catalog set contains a number of database tables.
       The database tables list different types of information (including
       proposed observations, scheduled observation, completed
       observations)
     * Initiate the search:
       You can choose to search directly from here, or choose More Options
       if you'd like to query on parameters other than position or date,
       or if you'd like to choose the tables to query within the missions
       you've selected. If you start the search from this page, the tables
       queried within each mission are preselected by the HEASARC based on
       internal priorities.

                                      Search from here or More options

     Enter an object name or coordinates, and/or enter a date/time, and
       click the Start Search button. OR

     Optionally enter an object name or coordinates, and/or enter a
   date/time, and click the More Options button.

     Select one or more tables.

     Click Submit Search, or Specify Additional Parameters. Submit Search
   will search the tables around the position and/or date you specify. By
   clicking Specify Additional Parameters you can query any field in the
   table.
     * Select data records to be examined in more detail.
       You can choose to retrieve or view lists of data associated with a
       given catalog entry, look at all the fields in the row (including
       those that were not initially displayed), plot your results, or
       cross-correlate your results with other tables.
     * Select data products (images, spectra, events lists, proposal
       abstracts, etc.) to be downloaded to your computer. This page is
       only shown if you chose to View data products from the query
       results page.
       Archival products are not available for all catalogs.

   Limitations of starting the search from the first page:
     * The HEASARC staff has given each table an internal priority
       ranking. When the search is initiated from the first page, only the
       highest ranking tables are searched for the table types and
       missions you have selected. To see all the tables available, click
       More Options.
     * When an object name is specified, the NED name resolver is queried
       first, using SIMBAD if NED is unable to resolve the object name. To
       select the name resolver yourself, click More Options. See Choosing
       a Name Resolver for more information about these services.
     * It is not possible to specify search on parameters other than
       object position or observation date.
     __________________________________________________________________

Detailed help

   The Main Browse interface comprises a series of forms: the Missions
   selection form, the optional Catalog Selection form, the optional
   Parameter Search form, the Query Results form, the Data Products form,
   and the Data Retrieval form. Typically, you will descend through these
   forms until the data desired is found. The last two forms are used only
   if archival data is to be retrieved. You may use the features of your
   Web browser to back up to previous forms, make a change to the
   selection at that level, and then go forward.

Mission Selection page

   The first form is the Missions selection form. You may enter one or
   more object names or coordinates, and/or observation dates. If you are
   planning to query tables on parameters other than position or dates,
   ignore this section.

   Select one or more missions/observatories, groups of catalogs, or
   individual catalogs by checking the checkboxes. Links will display help
   in a new window. The Multiwavelength Catalogs section on this first
   page lists a few special "pseudo-missions". Typically, these catalogs
   do not have associated archival data. The Master catalog contains
   catalogs which have been generated by combining smaller catalogs.

   There is a set of checkboxes where you can choose the types of
   information queried - checking these will have a filter effect on the
   missions and catalogs you select. For example, checking Proposal
   Information and ROSAT and ASCA means you are only selecting those ROSAT
   and ASCA tables which contain proposal information. Using these table
   types, you can more accurately select what types of tables you search.
     * Archive and Observations - tables which contain observation
       pointings.
     * Object Catalogs - compiled catalogs which contain objects found
       during a mission or survey.
     * Proposal Information - catalogs of proposals, abstracts, and
       schedules.
     * CDS VizieR - This special 'type' queries CDS's VizieR service for
       tables that are relevant to the missions and catalogs selected.
       (For example, selecting Stars and ROSAT and VizieR selects those
       resources VizieR holds that are star catalogs or have ROSAT data.)
     * There is a 'hidden' type - Physics - which is always on, and only
       applies to the Atomic Data catalogs.

   Finally, you can choose to modify the defaults for the output display.
   You may change the number of results returned for each table, change
   the output format, and choose to show all fields in the results rather
   than the default fields.

   Click Start Search if you're ready to search, or More Options if you'd
   like to choose the tables to query within each mission, or if you want
   to query tables on parameters other than position or observation date.

Selecting the Catalogs to Query

   NOTE: If you have initiated the search from the first page, this page
   will not be displayed.

   The top of the Catalog Selections page contains links to the selected
   missions. Each of these mission links will take you to a page which
   displays some description of all the catalogs available for the
   mission.

   This page displays the catalogs available for the selected missions.
   Each row in the tables tells you the catalog name, description, whether
   the catalog contains archive data, the default search radius, the name
   of the mission to which the table belongs, and the type of information
   contained in the table (Object catalog, observation catalog, proposal
   information, etc). When this page first comes up, the catalogs are
   ordered by priority so that more important tables appear first. You can
   sort these tables by other parameters by clicking on the up and down
   arrows beside each column name.

   This page requires you to check the catalogs you want to query and then
   click on Submit Search or Specify Additional Parameters buttons. The
   Submit Search button will run a search on the position or date you
   specify. Clicking on Specify Additional Parameters will allow you to
   search on other parameters.

Object Name/Coordinates Search

    Topics:

     * Explanation of Name/Coordinates Input Formats
     * Searching for Multiple Objects and/or Coordinate Pairs
     * Choosing a Name Resolver
     * Other Search Options
     * Cone Search Offset Calculation

    Explanation of Name/Coordinates Input Formats

   Example coordinate inputs:
     * 12 00 00, 4 12 6
     * 180., 4.21
     * 12 14.2 -4 12 6.48
     * 0., 0.

                             Example name inputs:
                               * Cygnus X-1
                               * Eta Car
                               * Ar Lac
                               * A2156
                               * Sco X-1

   By default, the coordinates you input are assumed to be J2000
   equatorial coordinates. You may change this by choosing a different
   coordinate system or equinox.

   The object name or position may be entered in a number of different
   formats. If an object name (i.e., any entry containing characters other
   than decimal digits, spaces, and '.', '-', or '+') is entered, then the
   name will be resolved to coordinates using one of the supported name
   resolving services.

   Object names should conform to the established IAU specifications for
   designating astronomical radiation sources. There is a nomenclature
   dictionary for celestial objects that can be searched if you are unsure
   of the object name that you should be using.

   Coordinates must be separated by a comma or by either a plus or minus
   sign. If a coordinate consists of a single number which contains a
   decimal point, then that coordinate is taken to be given in decimal
   degrees; otherwise, the sexagesimal format is assumed and the
   coordinate is parsed accordingly. Galactic coordinates are always
   assumed to be in degrees, whether in sexagesimal or decimal format. If
   equatorial coordinates are entered in sexagesimal format, right
   ascension values are assumed to be in hours/minutes/seconds, and
   declination values are assumed to be in degrees/minutes/seconds. Spaces
   should be used to separate hours/degrees from minutes and minutes from
   seconds in sexagesimal format. Seconds values are optional in
   sexagesimal format, so if you only want to specify hours/minutes and/or
   degrees/minutes that is allowed. The minutes can even be decimal
   minutes if so desired. Since it is impossible to determine whether a
   lone integer right ascension value is in hours or degrees and to
   prevent confusion, typing a lone integer coordinate value is considered
   invalid. This means, for example, if you want to do a search for
   objects near 0 hours right ascension and 0 degrees declination, then
   you should enter either "0.,0." (the decimal points flag the input as
   decimal degrees) or "00 00 00, 00 00 00" (if sexagesimal input is
   preferred). Entering simply "0,0" is considered an error.

    Searching for Multiple Objects and/or Coordinate Pairs

   Browse can perform name/coordinate cone searches on multiple object
   names and/or coordinate pairs in a single query submission. Separate
   each entry with a semicolon.

   Example of multiple name/coordinate inputs:
     * Cyg X-1; Cyg X-2; Cyg X-3
     * 3c273; 12.235, 15.345; 3c279; 18 12 5.29, 4 18 3.4

   The only limit on the number of name/coordinates that you can search
   for in this manner is determined by your browser. Depending upon your
   browser, the limit on the size of the name/coordinates entry string can
   be on the order of hundreds of characters or even thousands.

    Choosing a Name Resolver

   If you enter an object name, that object name is resolved into a pair
   of coordinates. You can specify the service to use to resolve the
   object name you have specified. The SIMBAD and NED services can be
   used. In general, SIMBAD should be preferred for galactic sources. By
   default, NED is queried first, and if the object name is not resolved,
   then SIMBAD is queried.

    Specifying Observation Dates

   You may query by observation dates. Not every table is queryable by
   date, for example the object catalogs do not have dates. In the tables
   of results that are returned, the observation date column may have
   different names - typical labels include 'start date', 'start time',
   'time', 'begin date', etc.

   The general format for the observation date is YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss,
   where the hh:mm:ss is optional. MJD is also accepted. Multiple dates
   are allowed - separate each date with a semicolon. Ranges can be
   specified using the '..' syntax shown below. If a range is not given,
   the range is assumed to be +/- 1 day around the date given.

   Example of date/time inputs:
     * 2001-01-20 06:00:00
     * 2001-01-20
     * 51929
     * 2001-01-20 .. 2001-02-15
     * 1992-12-31; 48980.5; 1995-01-15 12:00:00; 1997-03-20 .. 2000-10-18

    Other Search Options

   You may optionally choose the coordinate system/equinox that you wish
   to use in the search. The search results are displayed in the
   coordinate system and equinox that you choose.

   You can also choose the radius for the database search. Each catalog
   has a default radius which is displayed in units of arcminutes in the
   list of catalogs. If you wish to override these defaults, then use the
   Search Radius menu to select the value you want. In this case the same
   radius will be used for all selected catalogs.

   You may limit the number of displayed results by choosing the result
   limit from the menu.

   You can choose to display the output in HTML tables (the default),
   plain text tables (displays faster, and can be imported more easily
   into other programs), or FITS tables (can be analyzed using standard
   FITS tools like FTOOLS).

   Normally the results of a query have only the most significant columns
   displayed. If you want to see every column in the results, check the
   Show all Fields box.

    Cone Search Offset Calculation

   Browse will calculate the distance from the center of the search cone
   specified by the Object Name/Coordinates Search criterion to the
   coordinates of each observation in the Query Results output. Browse
   places these calculated values in a pseudo-column with the name
   'Offset' in the query results. These values have units of arc-minutes.
   The Haversine formula is used to compute the offsets.

Search by Parameter

   A more general search on table(s) can be made by choosing Specify
   Additional Parameters from the Catalogs Selection page. After doing
   this, you will see the page that allows you to set parameter criteria.

    Building a Parameter Search Query

   You can build a Parameter Search query consisting of multiple criteria.
   The form displays all parameters present in a catalog. It also allows
   you to see the minimum and maximum values for each parameter. You have
   the option to set several criteria in order to form your own query:
     * View: The checkboxes under View allow you to chose the parameters
       you want displayed. The defaults are selected when you first come
       to this page. (If you are querying multiple tables, this column is
       not displayed.)
     * Sort: The radio buttons under Sort allow you to select the
       parameter to sort results on. You may only sort on one parameter at
       a time.
     * Parameter: The Parameter heading displays the parameter name. Each
       link will take you to catalog help on the parameter.
     * Operation: This column allows you to set the operation. between
       will query between min and max, while outside is the opposite - not
       between min and max.
     * Min (or Value) and Max: If either the between or outside operators
       is selected, the Min (or Value) column allows you to set the
       minimum. However, if you selected the '=' or '!=' operator, you can
       query for a given value. The Max column can be used only if you
       have chosen the 'between' or 'outside' operators.
     * Wildcards, Spaces and Case Sensitivity:
          + If you are using the '=' or '!=' operators on a non-numeric
            field, you can use '*' or '%' (they are treated identically)
            as a wildcard to take the place of multiple characters: ie
            '3c*' will match 3c273, 3c279, etc.
          + Searches are generally case insensitive. Your entries will be
            uppercased before being sent to the database. The exception is
            the case of long text fields, such as abstracts. Those are
            stored in the database in mixed case, and your min/max values
            are not uppercased before searching.
          + Internal spaces are significant: searching for '3c 279' will
            not find '3c279'. Use wildcards (3c*) if there is a
            possibility of internal spaces.
          + Nulls: You can search for null values (useful when you are
            looking for all rows where a flag is not set, for example) by
            deleting the minimum field.

Query Results

   Once you have submitted a search, the database is queried to find the
   data which satisfy the conditions you have imposed. A Query Results
   form is returned with one line for each matching row in the database.
   If you have used the defaults and retrieved only the standard
   parameters then there will typically be between five and ten parameters
   including information such as name, observer, date of observation,
   position and exposure. If you selected all parameters there may dozens
   of parameters on a very wide form. The exact parameters will vary
   depending upon the catalog chosen. There is no field which is included
   in all catalogs, although right ascension ("ra") and declination
   ("dec") are usually present. To get information about a parameter click
   on the column headings in the form.

   If you requested data from more than one catalog, you will see separate
   listings for each catalog you chose.

  Coordinate Conversion Error

   Any coordinates shown in the results table have been converted to the
   same format as your input coordinates. If there is an error in
   computing the conversion, you will see the unaltered coordinates as
   given in the table, and the flag "!!" which is a link to this help
   section. One common reason for this error is that dummy coordinates (ie
   '-999') may have been entered in the table to indicate that an
   observation was not a true data observation.

  Sort Results

   You can resort the query results for a table by clicking on the up and
   down arrows beside each column name. (VizieR tables can only be
   searched in one direction and will only have one arrow for each
   column.)

  Show all columns

   Clicking on the magnifying glass icon at the start of each row will
   show you all the parameters for that row, including any that don't show
   up by default. For the results from VizieR queries, the icons are split
   - white on top and red on the bottom. Clicking on the white section
   will show the columns in the HEASARC format, while clicking on the red
   section will show the columns as VizieR formats them.

  Data Products

   To see what archival data products are associated with any given
   observation, click on the checkbox next to the entry, and then (if the
   option is available) choose whether you want to download a data
   products set (Retrieve) or get a listing of individual data products
   that are available for download (View). All the data sets are checked
   by default, if you don't want to download or list all those data sets,
   uncheck the ones you don't want.

   The products list will show the file sizes for all the products, which
   may influence your decision to download them. Any GIFs included in the
   data sets will be shown in miniature. Click on them to get a full size
   image. This allows you to preview the data set before downloading.

  Cross-Correlation of Query Results

   You may also cross correlate on query results from here. Click on the
   Cross-correlate button (there will be one for each table in the
   results). You will then see a form that sets up a cross-correlation
   query.

  Plotting Query Results with Java

   You may plot results even if you don't have the most recent browser
   version. Both client-side as well as server-side plotting are
   supported. If you have a browser that supports Java 1.1 you can use the
   client-side Java applet to plot. If you have don't have a browser that
   supports Java 1.1, you may plot using a server-side form-based plotting
   interface which can create GIF images of your plot.

   To begin plotting, click on the Plot button for the table you want to
   plot on the Results Page. If your applet does not load up, click on
   Java Server-Side Plotting to begin. You can choose from a variety of
   plot types that include scatter, histogram, cumulative histogram,
   aitoff projection, log/log, and semilog plots. You may also chose to
   sample data on another parameter.

Getting Data Products

   If you chose to View data products from the Query Results form, you
   will be presented with the Data Products form which repeats the query
   result information from the previous page for the entries you selected
   and follows it with a list consisting of brief descriptions of each of
   the data products available for the selected database table entries (if
   any). Click on the checkbox next to the data products you wish to
   download, and then click on the Retrieve button. The selected products
   are combined into a single TAR file. The Data Retrieval page summarizes
   the contents of this resulting file and allows you to retrieve it
   directly to your system via your Web browser. The data may also be
   retrieved via anonymous FTP.

   If you chose Retrieve on the Query Results page, you will instead go
   directly to the Data Retrieval page where a TAR file will be created
   for you to download. This option (and the View option) will only be
   presented if at least one of the catalogs you queried has data products
   sets defined. Most of the more important and new catalogs have defined
   data products sets, but many of the older catalogs have not yet
   implemented this sets feature.

   Almost all astronomical data files are stored in the standard FITS file
   format. Most astronomical analysis packages (for example, FTOOLS) can
   easily read FITS file and an extensive suite of software tools for the
   analysis of HEASARC and other astronomical data is available.

                         Browse Catalog Index Interface

    Topics:

     * Getting Started
     * Mission Links
     * Catalog Links
     __________________________________________________________________

Getting Started

   The Catalog Index Interface provides links to resources for each
   catalog in a mission. You can use it as a reference to find information
   on a particular catalog.

Mission Links

   Each mission name links to the FTP area for that mission. If you want
   to read about a mission, you can click on the description link next to
   the mission name. Below the mission name line, you will see links to
   the various catalogs in that mission.

Catalog Links

   The first link for each catalog contains its full name. If you want to
   search this catalog, click on this link and it will take you to a
   Browse Query Page.

   The second link is a short name for that catalog. It links to a help
   page describing the catalog and its parameters.

   The third link displays the number of parameters in the catalog.

   The fourth link displays the number of row entries in the catalog. This
   link will take you to the catalog's Transportable Database Aggregate
   Table (TDAT) file. This file contains parameter information, metabase
   information and all the data contents of a particular catalog.

                             Browse Batch Interface

    Topics:

     * Software Installation
     * Usage
     * Examples
     __________________________________________________________________

Software Installation

   Please note that only Object Name/Coordinates Searches can be executed
   using the the batch interface. Also, in order to use the batch
   facility, you will need access to a Unix workstation with Perl 5.x or
   Perl 4.x compiled and installed on it.

   You will need to download two Perl scripts:
    1. browse_extract.pl
    2. webquery.pl (Perl 5.x) OR webquery.pl (Perl 4.x)

   from the HEASARC's anonymous FTP server. Once you've downloaded these

Usage

   To use the Batch Interface, simply type browse_extract.pl at your shell
   prompt. Many options are available, but you are only required to
   specify the table to be searched and the astronomical position(s) of
   interest.

   The syntax of the command is:

   browse_extract.pl table=table name

     optional arguments:
     position=object name or position
     coordinates=EQUATORIAL or GALACTIC
     equinox=year
     radius=numerical value in units of arc-minutes
     fields=STANDARD or ALL
     name_resolver=NED or SIMBAD
     infile=input filename
     outfile=output filename

   All arguments are case insensitive.

   Explanation of command line arguments:

   table
          This is the abbreviated or short table name as used in Browse,
          e.g., ABELL, XTEOBS, ROSPUBLIC. You can find these table names
          in the Catalog Index Interface.

   position
          This is either the name of an object or a set of coordinates to
          search around. If a name is given it will be resolved using the
          service given in the name_resolver argument or SIMBAD by
          default. The syntax for coordinates is the same as those
          supported in the Browse Web service. If the coordinates string
          contains embedded spaces (e.g., 12 2 3.3, -13 8 1), then this
          argument should be enclosed in quotes.

   coordinates
          This should be either "Equatorial" or "Galactic". The default is
          Equatorial.

   equinox
          This defines the equinox year for both your input and and the
          resulting coordinates in the output. It defaults to 2000.

   radius
          This gives the radius in arcminutes for which a match should be
          made. This defaults to 1 degree. Note that this is different
          from the interactive Browse system where the default differs
          from table to table.

   parameters
          indicates which parameters are to be retrieved from the table.
          The default, "Standard", indicates that only a preselected set
          of the most critical parameters will be retrieved. "All" will
          retrieve all parameters from the table.

   name_resolver
          may be used to select the system used to convert names into
          coordinates. The currently supported services are NED and
          SIMBAD. The default is SIMBAD.

   infile
          specifies a file containing positions to be searched.

   outfile
          specifies a file to contain the table of returned results. If
          not specified the results will be printed on standard out.

   You may specify the target positions using the position argument, using
   a predefined file specified with infile, or from the standard input. In
   the latter two cases each line until an EOF will be used as a position.

Examples

   Are there any public ROSAT observations of 3C273?

   % browse_extract.pl table=rospublic position=3c273 name_resolver=ned

   should print to standard output a table like the following:

seq_id     |instrument|exposure|ra(2000)  |dec(2000)  |name              |public
_date(ISO)|

Search of table ROSPUBLIC around '3c273' with a radius 60' returns 25 rows

   I might first do a query of all WGACAT sources within 80' of the
   galactic center using:
% browse_extract.pl table=wgacat radius=80 coordinates=galactic position='0.,0.'
 outfile=wgacat_gc.list

   The results of that query can be edited (manually or by a simple
   script) to produce at file like:
359.386118, 1.149945
359.510470, 1.223261
359.274779, 0.933392
359.279818, 0.934399
359.383583, 0.977861
359.389096, 0.979161
359.392070, 0.972419
359.292038, 0.907242
359.389873, 0.967603
359.390891, 0.967811
359.393223, 0.969269
...

   plus 340 more lines.

   If this result is stored as wgacat_galcen.dat, we can find nearby HST
   Guide Star Catalog positions with:
browse_extract.pl table=gsc coordinates=galactic infile=wgacat_galcen.dat outfil
e=wgacat_galcen_guidestars.dat

   It will take a while to process 350 targets...

                      Browse Cross-Correlations Interface

    Topics:

     * Getting Started
     * Cross-Correlations Query

Getting Started

   This interface can give you information such as which ASCA and XTE
   observations were made within one week of each other and within 10'
   radius of each other.

Cross-Correlations Query

   First select which two tables to cross-correlate. Select the primary
   table from the first menu, and the secondary table from the second
   menu. A flag after each table name indicates the type of correlation
   that each table supports. For example, if a table contains a 'R' flag,
   it can be correlated by specifying radius. A 'T' flag indicates that
   the table can be correlated by time. A 'RT' indicates that the table
   can be correlated using radius and/or time.

   By default, the radius cross-correlation is selected, using the default
   radius. Correlation by time is also available, and you can change the
   correlation default delta in radius and time if you wish.
