      The Truman Scholarship is a $30,000 merit-based grant awarded to
    undergraduate students, who wish financial support to attend graduate
    or professional school in preparation for careers in government, the
              non-profit sector or elsewhere in public service.

                              Candidates must:

     * be U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals,
     * complete an application and write a policy recommendation,

       of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa or the

     * have extensive records of public and community service,
     * are committed to careers in government or elsewhere in public
       service, and
     * have outstanding leadership potential and communication skills.

                                   PURPOSE
    The Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation - the federal memorial to
   our thirty-third President - awards merit-based $30,000 scholarships to
   college students who plan to pursue careers in government or elsewhere
    in public service, and wish to attend graduate or professional school
      to help prepare for their careers. Truman Scholars participate in
     leadership development programs and have special opportunities for
           internships and employment with the federal government.

                             GENERAL GUIDELINES
   In 2002, the Foundation expects to award 75 - 80 Truman Scholarships on
    the basis of merit to junior-level students at four-year colleges and
                              universities who
     * have extensive records of public and community service,
     * are committed to careers in government or elsewhere in public
       service, and
     * have outstanding leadership potential and communication skills.

      The Foundation anticipates selecting up to three scholars who are
     residents of Puerto Rico and the Islands with senior-level academic
                                  standing.

       Scholars are eligible to receive $3,000 for the senior year of
    undergraduate education and $27,000 for graduate studies. Scholars in
     master's degree programs planning to receive degrees in one to two
       years are eligible to receive $13,500 per year. Scholars in law
     programs are eligible to receive $13,500 for the second year of law
   school and $13,500 at the start of the third year's second semester if
       they provide evidence that they will enter public service upon
       graduation or upon completion of any judicial clerkships after
   graduation. Scholars in graduate programs requiring three or more years
   of academic study are eligible to receive $9,000 per year for a maximum
   of three years. Scholars may attend graduate or professional schools in
                 the United States or in foreign countries.

      In 2002, one "state" scholarship will be available to a qualified
    resident nominee in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia,
     Puerto Rico, and, considered as a single entity, the Islands: Guam,
    Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern
   Mariana Islands. (Residency is generally determined by home address for
         school registration, family's primary residence, and voter
   registration.) The Foundation will select up to 30 at-large Scholars in
                                    2002.

                         A CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE
    The Foundation defines public service as employment in government at
        any level, uniformed services, public-interest organizations,
    nongovernmental research and/or educational organizations, public and
    private schools, and public service-oriented nonprofit organizations
   such as those whose primary purposes are to help needy or disadvantaged
                   persons or to protect the environment.

    The Foundation has supported Truman Scholars in many fields of study,
   including agriculture, biology, engineering, environmental management,
       physical and social sciences, and technology policy, as well as
    traditional fields such as economics, education, government, history,
   international relations, law, political science, public administration,
           nonprofit management, public health, and public policy.

      Former Truman Scholars serve as managers of government programs,
   legislators and aides for legislative bodies, foreign service officers,
       school teachers, staff members in policy analysis and research
     organizations, attorneys for government agencies, public defenders,
      professors, and professional staff in advocacy organizations and
                        not-for-profit institutions.

                          CONDITIONS OF ELIGIBILITY
                            Each nominee must be
     * a full-time junior-level student at a four-year institution

       undergraduate study and who expects to receive a baccalaureate
       degree between December 2002 and August 2003, or a student in his
       or her third year of collegiate study who expects to graduate
       during the 2001-2002 academic year, or a senior-level student who
       is a resident of Puerto Rico or the Islands,
     * committed to a career in public service as defined above,
     * in the upper quarter of his or her class, and
     * a United States citizen or a United States national from American
       Samoa or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Resident
       aliens (green card holders) are not eligible.

                            SELECTION PROCEDURES

     Selection of Truman Scholarship Finalists
   A committee examines all nominations and selects about 200 Finalists to
   be interviewed for Truman Scholarships. Finalists are selected on the
   basis of
     * extent and quality of community service and government involvement,
     * leadership record,
     * academic performance and writing and analytical skills, and
     * suitability of the nominee's proposed program of study for a career
       in public service.

     Priority is given to candidates proposing to enroll in graduate and
      professional programs specifically oriented to careers in public
   service. These include law programs and master's and doctorate programs
      in public administration, public policy analysis, public health,
       international relations, government, economics, social services
    delivery, education and human resource development, and conservation
                        and environmental protection.

   Scholars may make program changes before beginning graduate studies if
     the changes are consistent with preparation for a career in public
                                  service.

     Selection of Truman Scholars
   Regional selection panels interview Finalists in late February and
   March and select Truman Scholars largely on the basis of
     * leadership potential and communication skills,
     * intellectual strength and analytical ability, and
     * likelihood of "making a difference" in public service.

    If a Panel judges that none of the Finalists from a state adequately
     meets each of these criteria, it does not select any candidate from
      that state. The scholarship will be carried over to 2003 when two
           scholarships will be available to qualified residents.

   The Foundation covers 50% of the airfare to a maximum Foundation share
     of $500 for Finalists who are legal residents of the 48 continental
    states, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern
    Mariana Islands,the Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia. The
    Foundation covers 75% of the airfare to a maximum Foundation share of
    $750 for Finalists from Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam who are enrolled in
    institutions in their home state or district. The Foundation does not
         provide for meals, lodging, or local ground transportation.
