      Description of research projects:

      Overall Objective: Research and develop insect control technologies
      that offer an titleernative to conventional insecticides and can lead
      to sustainable fruit production.
      I. Particle Film Technology.
      Co-inventor of patented particle film technology for insect and disease
      control. Particle film technology is based on an inert mineral, kaolin.
      The idea behind this concept is to coat plants with a protective
      mineral barrier that prevents oviposition (insect egg laying) and
      feeding. Kaolin has been used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, paint
      pigments, plastics and as a food additive. The kaolin that we used is
      manufactured by Engelhard Corporation, Iselin, NJ. It is mined in
      Georgia and goes through a series of sizing and refining processes to
      remove heavy metals, other impurities and to improve its whiteness.
      There is a small amount of additives (spreaders, binders, suspension
      agents) in the final formulation that are listed by the EPA as approved
      inert ingredients.
      Research on this concept began in 1994 and the pest control aspects
      were actually an offshoot of an original goal which was to prevent
      disease by a waterproof particle barrier. Research soon showed that
      hydrophilic particle film barriers prevented insect feeding and
      oviposition. The mechanisms-of-action are dependent on the type of
      insect (chewing, sucking) and its feeding and ovipositional (egg
      laying) behaviors.
      A CRADA (Cooperative Research and Development Agreement) between the
      ARS, Kearneysville, and Engelhard was developed in 1996 and the first
      commercial product was marketed in 1999 called ‘Surround'. This
      formulation needed the addition of a liquid spreading agent. The most
      recent formulation, called ‘Surround WP', has all of the formulation
      ingredients incorporated into the mineral. ‘Surround WP' is listed as
      an approved material for organic crop production because it is based on
      a natural mineral.
      ‘Surround WP' has been rapidly adopted by west coast pear growers for
      early season control of pear psylla. This insect has been particularly
      difficult to control because it rapidly develops insecticide
      resistance. Use of ‘Surround WP' has lead to a 50% reduction in
      insecticide usage in the northern pear producing area of Washington.
      The additional benefit to using ‘Surround WP' on pear is that it makes
      the pear's skin much smoother. Other uses that are gaining acceptance
      are control of leafhopper and Japanese beetle on grape, apple maggot,
      plum curculio and other pests of apple. This technology was utilized
      quite successfully in a Area-Wide pilot study in Kern Co., California,
      to prevent the movement of glassy-winged sharpshooter into grape and
      prevent the spread of Pierce's Disease which this insect transmits when
      feeding on grape. Many researchers are investigating the use of this
      technology for control of many other insect pests in numerous types of
      crops.
      Particle film technology not only controls insects. It controls certain
      fungal and bacterial diseases, can prevent sunburn of fruits,
      heat-stress in plants, and acts as an efficient pesticide delivery
      system. One formulation is the only proven material known to prevent
      freeze damage and can be formulated as a herbicide. These technologies
      are protected by 7 patents with two more patents pending. For more

      II. Sugar Ester Technology.
      Acylsugars, also known as sugar esters, are a class of compounds
      produced by reacting sugars with aliphatic or aromatic acids. They
      occur naturally in plants and are primarily being commercially produced
      for the food industry. The glandular trichomes (leaf hairs) of wild
      tobacco, Nicotiana gossei Domin, have been known to possess
      insecticidal materials for decades Yet, it was not until the early
      1990's that glucose and sucrose esters were determined to be the
      primary insecticidal compounds within the trichomes of Nicotiana spp.
      Yield of natural sugar esters extracted from wild tobacco were low and
      not economically feasible. Soon analogs of sucrose esters could be
      synthesized that had similar insecticidal activity. Both natural and
      synthetic sucrose esters have been shown to have contact toxicity to a
      select groups of soft-bodied arthropods including mites, aphids,
      whitefly and psyllids. Certain sugar esters extracted from solanaceous
      plants have also been shown to deter feeding and oviposition of mites,
      whiteflies, and leafminers.
      Interest in sugar esters waned in recent years due to the difficulties
      in economically manufacturing these compounds and their insolubility in
      water which made them difficult to use. In 1998, a CRADA between the
      ARS, Kearneysville, and AVA Chemical Ventures, LLC, Portsmouth, NH, was
      developed to produce a sugar ester that could be economically
      manufactured, easy to use, and had superior insecticidal activity over
      previous synthetic sugar esters. This CRADA also involved chemists with
      Applied Power Concepts, Inc., Orange, CA.
      Significant progress has been made. We have identified several new
      classes of sugar ester materials, called polyols, with excellent
      insecticidal activity and formulation properties. Chemists at Applied
      Power Concepts have developed an environmentally friendly method to
      synthesize these polyols in which the only by-product from
      manufacturing is water. A number of researchers have independently
      tested these materials and have found excellent mite, aphid, thrips,
      whitefly and psyllid control. Because of the recency of this progress,
      little information on this effort is available, and the manufacturing
      methods and specific polyols are currently the subject of 3 patents
      pending. One material that resulted from this research is ‘Sucrose
      octanoate'. This material is in the final stages of EPA registration as
      an insecticide.

      III. Host Plant Resistance.
      Host plant resistance is a popular method of incorporating natural
      plant defense genes into cultivated crops. These defense genes are most
      often found in wild relatives of cultivated crops. During the process
      of human cultivation and selection for higher yielding and better
      tasting crops, most of these defense genes were lost. As a result, we
      must apply pesticides to our crops to protect them throughout their
      gowning season.
      Breeders are able to introduce defense genes back into cultivated crops
      by conventional breeding techniques or by more direct movement of genes
      into plant using molecular genetic techniques. Regardless of the
      method, the result is a cultivar that can now naturally withstand the
      attack of certain pests without the use of chemical pesticides. Use of
      resistant plants is the most environmentally friendly and economical
      method available for pest control.
      Projects on host plant resistance are in support of the stone fruit and
      pome fruit breeding effort at Kearneysville. These include the
      evaluation of pear crosses made between susceptible pear cultivars and
      wild pear relatives resistant to pear psylla. Research on mechanisms of
      resistance and effects on population dynamics are the main focus. In
      addition, the non-target effects of pear cultivars transformed with
      disease resistant genes (e.g. lytic peptide gene) for key diseases,
      like fireblight, are evaluated. It is important to know if the
      expression of disease resistance genes in tree fruits will affect
      non-target insect pests of those trees.
      Accomplishments of this research include: 1) the discovery that
      peach-almond hybrids were the first known resistance source for lesser
      peachtree borer in peach germplasm. This germplasm was also found to be
      highly resistant to a major disease of peach, Leucostoma canker; 2)
      elucidated an important mechanism of resistance in pear, "ovipositional
      antixenosis," and developed a novel greenhouse technique to screen pear
      germplasm for this resistance; 3) conducted the first studies on
      variation in pear psylla to resistance in pear and determined that
      moderately resistant cultivars would be of limited value to managing
      pear psylla because survival was too high making it possible for them
      to adapt to this resistance. In addition, a recent paper was submitted
      to a journal showing that pear transformed and expressing the lytic
      peptide gene for control of fireblight also reduces pear psylla
      infestations. See Richard Bell's and Ralph Scorza's web page for more
      information!
