                                Plasma Modeling
     __________________________________________________________________

   A collection of computer codes developed in a collaborative effort
   between T and X Divisions at Los Alamos have been applied to a variety
   of plasma modeling problems. The core codes are used to calculate a set
   of basic atomic physics data based on ab initio atomic structure
   calculations. The calculated data include atomic energy levels,
   oscillator strengths, electron-impact excitation and ionization cross
   sections, photoionization cross sections, and autoionization rates.
   Plasma modeling calculations are performed by other codes which access
   and use these data sets directly. These codes calculate both
   equilibrium and nonequilibrium population distributions of atomic
   levels and spectra. Both fine-structure and configuration-average
   atomic models can be used depending of the desired level of complexity.
   Detailed spectra involving millions of optical transitions can be
   calculated. In configuration-average mode unresolved-transition-array
   (UTA) theory based on Slater integrals stored in the atomic data set
   can be used to construct realistic spectra for atoms with very complex
   configurations. The possibility of using these methods for high-Z atoms
   is now being considered.

   The codes have been used to predict the behavior of plasmas produced in
   the laboratory and to analyze plasma sources of commercial interest.
   The first successful application of the codes involved the analysis of
   opacity measurements. Here x rays are used to backlight a plasma and
   the resulting transmission is recorded. For a given density and
   temperature, level populations can be calculated assuming local
   thermodynamic equilibrium. These populations with the calculated
   photoexcitation and photoionization cross sections are used to predict
   the absorption properties of the plasma. Figure 1 is a comparison of
   theoretical and observed transmission from experiments performed at the
   Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in England. The absorbing medium is an
   aluminum plasma at a temperature of 40 eV and density of 0.0135 g/cm^3.

   It is well known that impurity radiation is a significant energy loss
   mechanism in tokomak plasmas. Here impurities from the wall contaminate
   the plasma, and electron collisions with these ions produce radiation
   which degrades the reactor performance. Also, impurity gases can be
   introduced into certain regions of the reactor to cool critical plasma
   facing components such as the divertor. The latter scheme is being
   considered for the development of the International Thermonuclear
   Experimental Reactor ( ITER ). Thus there is a crucial need for
   accurate calculations of radiative power loss for a variety of elements
   of interest. The Los Alamos codes have been used to provide more
   accurate estimates of power loss for various impurity ions. Significant
   discrepancies between these calculations and the standard method, which
   uses less accurate atomic physics, have been uncovered. The effects of
   electron density and metastable states have been found to be important.

   The codes have been used to study several plasmas of commercial
   interest. One project involves the production of extreme ultraviolet
   radiation for lithography applications. Relativistic electron beams are
   injected into a slightly ionized gas. Energy is transfered from the
   beam electrons to the plasma electrons which become very hot. The hot
   electrons then ionize and excite the surrounding gas atoms to produce
   the desired radiation. The kinetics codes have been used to predict the
   output spectrum. In addition, the capability to provide the
   simultaneous solution of level populations and the free-electron energy
   distribution is being implemented for this project.

   The codes have been used to generate xenon atomic data for the one- and
   two-dimensional modeling of plasma display panels. Here an electrical
   discharge is used to excite a gas and produce radiation which is used
   to drive a display panel. Since the computer simulations are very time
   consuming the calculated atomic data must be reduced to a model
   containing only a few atomic states. An averaging technique has been
   developed to perform this data reduction.

   Other applications include spectroscopic diagnostics for inertial
   confinement fusion (ICF). Here spectroscopy is used to determine the
   plasma temperature and density within ICF hohlraums by comparison with
   calculated line ratios. Another project is a Los Alamos /Russian
   collaboration to study highly resolved spectra from plasmas produced by
   various means. This study has resulted in the identification of many
   satellite lines emitted from magnesium and silicon plasmas. The codes
   have also been used to model x-ray laser plasmas with regard to the
   gain coefficient for various lasing transitions. Various laser produced
   plasmas from both Los Alamos and other outside sources have been
   studied. In addition, electron beam effects were found to be important
   for determining spectral properties of plasmas produced by pulsed power
   devices such as the x-pinch. Figure 2 shows a comparison of theory and
   experiment for the Be-like spectrum of aluminum observed in the Cornell
   University x-pinch. The electron beam effects are included in the
   calculation by using a non-Maxwellian electron distribution.
