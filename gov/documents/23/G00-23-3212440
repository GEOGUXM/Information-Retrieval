                What Is The DOE Information Security Server?

          The DOE Information Security Server (DOE-IS) is an advanced
          server on the Internet whose goal is to enhance information
          security data sharing within the United States Department of
          Energy (DOE) community. The DOE community includes all DOE sites
          and contractors. The Server contains tools and documents related
          to information security that have been made available by many
          sources both within and outside of the DOE.

          The server is available for users within the DOE community to
          make available those tools and documents they have developed
          that would be useful to others within the DOE community. In
          fact, users within the DOE community are encouraged to make any
          useful tools and documents available for use by others. These
          tools do not have to be fully polished, commercial quality
          tools, but can be simple, custom applications developed as part
          of normal operations. Please contact CIAC at: ciac@llnl.gov or
          925-422-8193 to discuss any tools or documents that you might be
          able to provide.

          The primary access method is through the world wide web (www).
          Using a web browser, connect to:

        WWW: http://doe-is.llnl.gov

          Alternate access is available to most of the resources using
          anonymous FTP or dial-up access to a BBS.

INTRODUCTION

          The Computer Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC) operates the
          DOE Information Security Server (DOE-IS) for the DOE community,
          which includes all DOE sites and contractors. The DOE-IS server
          is an advanced Internet server containing information and tools
          related to information security. The goal of this server is to
          enhance information security data sharing in the DOE community.
          Many tools and documents are developed at DOE sites that are
          usable at other sites. Other tools and documents are developed
          for the DOE as a whole, but their existence is often not
          communicated to many of the potential users. This server
          provides a central place to locate these tools and documents
          where DOE personnel with information security responsibilities
          can go to find out what is available and to advertise the
          availability of their own tools and documents. In addition, the
          server will contain discussion areas for discussions of computer
          security needs and of work in process on new tools and
          documents.

          To achieve this goal, the server contains publicly available
          tools and documents, DOE-developed tools and documents, and
          custom tools and documents related to information security.
          Public tools and documents are those developed outside of the
          DOE and made available over the Internet. Public tools include
          shareware tools which must be paid for after an initial
          evaluation period and evaluation versions of commercial tools.

          DOE-developed tools and documents were created as part of a
          funded DOE project. These tools tend to be finished products,
          developed for a particular program, or for the DOE at large.
          Programs such as Spi (Security Profile Inspector) and Nid
          (Network Intrusion Detector) fit in this category. Custom tools
          and documents are those developed by different sites as part of
          their daily operations, and that have applicability outside of
          their developing organizations. Custom tools and documents are
          expected to be not as polished or well documented as the
          DOE-developed tools, but having access to them will give another
          site a large head start in developing a similar capability of
          their own. Sites who have or are developing information security
          tools and documents are encouraged to make those materials
          available for inclusion on the server. We will take anything
          that could be useful from rough coding to fully polished
          applications if they could be used by people outside your
          organization. For materials that are restricted to a limited
          audience, we will work with you to provide an appropriate level
          of protection.

          The server contains a connection to the CIAC Archive, giving it
          immediate access to all the materials and documents already
          stored there. In addition to the existing open areas, the DOE-IS
          server will soon have a closed area for private data sharing
          among DOE sites. We are also adding discussion areas for
          discussions of Information Security topics, both open and
          closed.

          The primary access method for the server is the world wide web
          (www or the web). Alternate access methods include FTP and
          dialup, but you must use a web browser to get full access to the
          server. In addition, when the closed areas become available, you
          will need a browser that is compatible with SSL (Secure Sockets
          Layer) security such as Netscape. No connections to the closed
          areas will be allowed without an encrypted link provided by SSL.
          Dial-up connections will use the CIAC BBS.

WWW CONNECTIONS

          The primary connection method for access to the server is to use
          the world wide web. Using your favorite web browser, connect to
          the following URL:

          http://doe-is.llnl.gov

          You should immediately see the DOE-IS home page, with buttons
          for the CIAC home page and other sub pages in the server.

          Protected pages are available, users in the DOE community will
          need a web browser that supports SSL and a username and password
          registered on the system. Check back here for more information
          when the protected pages become available (that is, when you
          access a page that asks for a username and password).

FTP CONNECTIONS

          FTP connections to the DOE-IS server is through the CIAC FTP
          server. Use FTP to connect to ciac.llnl.gov (134.9.214.4). Use
          anonymous as your user name and your e-mail address as your
          password.

          There is a document explaining the directory of downloadable
          files stored in the file 0-index.txt in the first level
          directory. All the computer security-related files and documents
          are in subdirectories of the directory,

          /pub/ciac

          There is a file, 0-index.txt, in each directory which lists the
          other files in that directory and briefly describes their
          contents. The file whatsnew.txt in the /pub/ciac directory
          contains a list of the new files placed in the archive. Use the
          get and mget commands to download files to your own machine.

DIALUP CONNECTIONS

          Dialup connections to the DOE-IS server is through the CIAC BBS.
          Note that not all the materials on the server are available on
          the BBS. Access it with a modem and a terminal. Set up your
          modem as 8 bit no parity and one stop bit. The access numbers
          are,

          (925) 423-4753 - 28.8K baud
          (925) 423-3331 - 28.8K baud
          The first time you call in, you must register your name and
          address. To download or read files, switch to the file section
          and follow the directions. Most of the popular downloading
          protocols are available, including XMODEM, YMODEM, SEALink, and
          Kermit.

SCANNING DOWNLOADED SOFTWARE

          As with any software you obtain, you should exercise caution and
          scan individual software packages before using the software for
          the first time. Unless otherwise indicated, all software on the
          server has been scanned for known viruses, but it is advisable
          to scan all downloaded software again using the most recent
          version of a virus scanning tool. Be sure to scan archived
          applications after they have been extracted from the .ZIP, .ARC,
          or SIT archive, as most scanning software cannot detect a virus
          within an archived application.

DOWNLOADING CONSIDERATIONS

          If you are downloading to a Macintosh using FTP or the BBS, be
          sure to use the Text version of the downloading protocol (eg.
          Text-XMODEM, Text-YMODEM, etc. for downloads from the CIAC BBS
          and ASCII mode with FTP server) at your Macintosh when
          downloading pure text files or unformatted documents. The Text-
          version of the downloading protocol corrects for the difference
          in the end of line characters used on the PC and Macintosh
          systems (the PC wants a CR-LF at the end of a line while the
          Macintosh wants a CR only.) When downloading a binary Macintosh
          file such as a Macintosh program file or a formatted document,
          be sure to set the MacBinary form of the protocol (e.g.
          MacBinary-XMODEM for downloads from the CIAC BBS, and Binary
          mode with FTP) on your Macintosh. If you forget to do this, you
          can still do the conversion later using the Apple File Exchange
          utility included with the Macintosh system. For other binary
          files, such as PC executable files that you are downloading on
          your Macintosh for use elsewhere, use the plane binary format.
          Macintosh files in SIT archives must be extracted with Stuffit
          before they can be used. Macintosh files in .CPT archives must
          be extracted with Compactor or Extractor. SEA files on the
          Macintosh are self extracting archives and need no archiving
          program.

          Downloadable PC-DOS/MS-DOS files are either text files (.TXT),
          zip or arc archives (.ZIP or .ARC), self-extracting archives
          (.EXE) or executables (.COM or .EXE). Text files and executables
          can be downloaded directly and used. Be sure to use a binary
          downloading capability (e.g. XMODEM) for the executable files
          and archives. Files in ZIP archives must be extracted after
          downloading with PKUNZIP before they can be used. Archiving
          utilities for both PC and Macintosh files are available in their
          respective utility sections.

USING SHAREWARE

          If you are using a shareware package downloaded from these or
          any other sources, be sure to follow the instructions in the
          package for compensating the author. The cost is generally
          minimal ($10 to $50), for some very useful applications.

SUBMITTING MATERIAL TO THE DOE-IS SERVER

          If you have materials that could be used by others in the DOE
          community, we encourage you to make them available in the DOE-IS
          server. Even unfinished or rough materials may be acceptible if
          their inclusion will serve others within the community. If you
          would like to submit materials for inclusion in the server,
          please contact ciac at 925-422-8193, or send e-mail to
          ciac@llnl.gov. We will discuss the applicability of your
          materials with you and provide you with the current guidelines
          for submission. In general, short documents should be submitted
          as text or html format. Longer formatted documents should be in
          Adobe Acrobat format with a text version for those who do not
          have an Acrobat reader. Software and associated documentation
          should be submitted in an appropriate archive for the target
          hardware (UNIX - tar, PC - ZIP, Mac - SIT). In addition, a short
          document should accompany the archive describing the contents
          and what it is for so that readers can determine if it is
          appropriate for their situation. If possible, software should be
          available in source code so that a user can convert it to work
          in his particular situation.

          Note that these guidelines are not absolute, and that we will
          work with you to best make use of your particular materials.

          The free Acrobat Reader is available directly from Adobe.
