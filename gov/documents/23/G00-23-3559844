An Overall Look at Our Completed Projects*

ATP Delivers a High Return to the Nation

     * The projected economic impact of a handful of early ATP projects
       would pay for every ATP project funded since 1990.
     * New prosthesis technology for repairing damaged knee ligaments is
       expected to deliver $15B in net benefits, attributable to ATP,
       measured using a "quality-adjusted-life-years" index for patients
       receiving this treatment (Tissue Engineering).
     * New biocompatible polymers for cartilage repair deliver $98M in
       estimated benefits, attributable to ATP, for avoidance of second
       surgeries to remove implants, such as pins and screws (Integra
       LifeSciences).

ATP Partners with NIH to Accelerate the
Human Genome Project

     * ATP's past support for the development of high-risk technologies
       has enabled practical use of DNA information.

       application of DNA information.

     * "Real public benefit would depend upon major expansions in
       commercial markets for DNA analysis."
     * "Success of the genome project wasn't guaranteed in the early days,
       even less sure was the promise of these commercial markets."
     * "We at the NIH genome project appreciate the partnership we've
       had...in the development and implementation of the NIST ATP
       program. This experience has had a lasting positive effect on
       advancing our research agenda and also on how we run our own
       programs."

     ATP accelerated the progress of the Human Genome Project
     * ATP-funded advances in DNA chip technology have greatly improved
       the speed and quality of DNA testing.
     * Affymetrix DNA chips incorporate ATP-supported technology.
     * ATP-funded DNA chip technology is now used in all areas of
       biotechnology.

     ATP funded development of high-throughput sequencing machines
   (PE-Biosystems). Hundreds of high-throughput sequencing machines are
   used at both NIH and Celera Genomics.

ATP Support Has Helped Establish Leading Biotech Companies

     * Some observers say ATP is the "godfather" of the U.S. biochip
       industry.

     * Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) started independent operations in
       1993, received ATP award in 1994. Affymetrix had 512 employees in
       1999 with sales totaling $201M in 2000.
     * PE Biosystems (Foster City, CA) received ATP awards in 1994, 1995,
       and 1998. The company had 3,504 employees in 1999 with $1.4B in
       sales in 2000.
     * GeneTrace Systems (Alameda, CA) was "basically just a couple of
       guys and an idea" in 1994. The ATP award in 1995 "really launched
       us...allowed us to be something real" (Christopher Becker,
       President). GeneTrace now has more than 40 employees. "I can speak
       for small companies in saying that [ATP] stepped up to provide us
       funds and took risks where the venture capitalists would not."
     * Vysis (Downers Grove, IL) was incorporated in 1991 and received its
       first ATP award in 1994. By 1999, Vysis had 138 employees and in
       2000 reached $21M in sales. "Two-thirds of all of Vysis' current
       technology, and all of our future technology, can be traced back to
       ATP funding" (Uwe Miller, Director of Advanced Technology).
     * Nanogen (San Diego, CA) was founded in 1993 and received an ATP
       award in 1995. By 1999 Nanogen had 142 employees and by 2000 had
       reached $11M in sales. The ATP funding award was "like a godsend"
       in "getting us going as a company" (James O'Connell, Vice President
       of Research).

ATP-Funded Research Promises Improved
Food Safety and Quality

Highlights from "Closed-Cycle Air Refrigeration (CCAR) Technology for
Cross-Cutting Applications in Food Processing, Volatile Organic Compound
Recovery, and Liquid Natural Gas Industries," by Thomas Pelsoci

     * New closed-cycle air refrigeration (CCAR) technology is a higher
       performing, more cost effective industrial refrigeration technology
       for the ultra cold (70° F to 150° F) range.
     * CCAR replaces applications where ammonia-based mechanical
       refrigeration has been the dominant industrial technology, but with
       a temperature limitation of above 70° F; some applications
       previously had to depend on cryogenic cooling to achieve
       temperatures approaching 150° F.
     * New CCAR technology promises improved food safety and quality, with
       reduced costs for cooling and less reliance on highly emissive
       diesel- powered transportation.
     * The target and primary market for CCAR expected in 2001 to be the
       $131B "further-processed" and "ready-to-eat" segment of the U.S.
       food industry.

     * In this rapidly growing market segment, CCAR is poised to become an
       enabling technology for:

     * Improved food safety from rapid freezing of precooked processed
       foods
     * Increased food quality and food processing yields
     * Reduced environmental emissions from diesel powered road
       transportation of liquid nitrogen and other cryogens.

     Estimated economic benefits^(1) over the 2002 to 2016 time period
   from use of CCAR in food processing are high.
     * Benefit to cost ratio estimated between 220:1 to 280:1 (from
       improved food quality and yield).
     * Net present value of ATP's investment ($2.1M) estimated between
       $459M and $585M.
     * Additional annual exports estimated between $5M and $6M.
     * Diesel emissions estimated to be lower, as 12,000 to 14,000 truck
       shipments of cryogens are avoided each year.

     Additional environmental and energy benefits are predicted in other
   applications, beyond food processing.
     * Significant potential for use in the U.S. liquid natural gas (LNG)
       industry, volatile organic compound (VOC) recovery, and the
       pharmaceutical and petrochemical industries.
     * Use of CCAR as refrigeration for LNG terminals would enable the
       shift from diesel fuel to natural gas for ocean going vessels, with
       an up to 98% reduction in carbon monoxide, a 55% reduction in
       nitrogen oxide, and a 95% reduction in particulate emissions.

Description of Study

   Based on primary research and analysis completed during 2000 and early
   2001, this economic case study examines the national economic benefit
   of an ATP joint venture project, involving Air Products and Chemicals,
   Inc., and Toromont Process Systems, Inc., that received an award in
   1995 to design, fabricate and pilot test closed-cycle air refrigeration
   (CCAR). CCAR is a new form of industrial refrigeration that uses
   environmentally benign dry air as the working fluid. With ATP's $2.1
   million investment, matched by $2.2 million corporate investment, this
   joint venture (view non-proprietary project abstract) developed CCAR as
   a cost effective industrial refrigeration technology for the ultra cold
   (70° F to 150° F) range. Technology development and successful pilot
   testing were completed in 1999. Business development and marketing are
   underway.
