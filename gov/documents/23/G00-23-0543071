     __________________________________________________________________

   Every employee should have an Employees Move Handout. This has
   important information about packing, what items need to be emptied
   before the move and which can be moved full. Please review the handout
   and begin packing offices to be ready for the move. See Sue if you do
   not have an Employee Handout. Remember, we are responsible for packing
   our own offices and will need to assist in packing the data rooms and
   labs.

     Items for discard include old files, software and broken equipment.

     Beware of CD Number tags (with bar code). These items are controlled
   property items and may need to be excessed through Cornie.

     Those of you who are currently in systems furniture, remember you
   will need to be packed and out of your offices 1 week earlier than our
   scheduled move week.

   The Open House is Friday 19 February at 11am - 4pm. This is an
   opportunity to see the new building and familiarize yourself with the
   layout.
   You can get more information from the Transition Web Site.
   Items to consider NOW!
     * The Division excess property (posted in Cornies office) will be
       opened to the Center 18 February. If there are items you want to
       claim from the list, please do so now. If you have additions for
       the list, please e-mail Karen. Furniture trading at the Center
       level should start now. There are three levels of trade (within
       DIV; within NGDC; within NOAA) which must take place before excess.
       Excess must be COMPLETED by or before April 19!
     * The Division has the responsibility to ready Sun Systems for the
       move (e.g. Kryton, Camille, Queeg...) Tom Carey and Lorin Hattrup
       are our representatives. They are working with Mike Doney to move
       these systems. Note: Globe Server will now be moved 4/19 not 4/20
       as originally planned.
     * Each employee NOT in systems furniture needs to prepare a floor
       plan of your office. This will be taped to your new office door to
       help the movers deliver your furniture. They will put things as
       labeled on the layout. Make sure it is clear and correct, so you
       get things where you want them! All floor plans need to be to Karen
       Horan by March 19th.
     * There will be an 'Employee Handbook' printed and distributed soon.
     * We may begin packing some data rooms in RL-6 on Sunday, April 11.
       Volunteers welcome!
     * Keys, parking passes etc. will need to be turned in to Admin. More
       information on this later. Admin will also issue keys to the Skaggs
       Research Center soon.
     * If you do not have a power strip for you computer, please let Sue
       know by the end of February.
     * The wall displays in RL-3 should be dismantled by DIV. DIV must
       pack the display board contents (pix & graphs).
     * Mike Doney is asking for key people from each Division to help
       clean up after the move (~5/3/99). See Mike if you want to
       volunteer.
