                    What is the Ocean Chemistry Division?
   The Ocean Chemistry Division (OCD) is one of the four scientific
   research divisions within the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological
   Laboratory (AOML). The diverse Ocean Chemistry Division scientific
   staff is comprised not only of chemical oceanographers and atmospheric
   chemists but also biological oceanographers and geologists. OCD
   typically employs multi-disciplinary approaches to solve scientific
   research questions central to National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) mission requirements. The division's work
   includes projects that are important both in enhancing our basic
   understanding of the coupled atmospheric/ocean system but also in
   assessing the current and future effects of human activities on the
   coastal and oceanic environments. Detailed information about specific
   research projects can be found within the major research areas section
   of this site.
