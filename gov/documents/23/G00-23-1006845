  Telis, Pamela A., 2001, Estimation of Infiltration Rates of Saturated Soils at
  Selected Sites in the Caloosahatchee River Basin: OFR 01-65, 16 p.

   ABSTRACT
   Soil infiltration measurements were made at 23 sites in the
   Caloosahatchee River Basin in Glades, Hendry, and Lee Counties in
   southwestern Florida. The sandy soils of the basin are characterized by
   high infiltration rates limited in some areas by a high water table
   during the wet season. Because soil characteristics are similar within
   the basin, soils are classified by landscape group based on landscape
   cover and associated drainage. In accordance with this designation by
   the South Florida Water Management District, 11 sites are classified in
   the rock landscape group, 7 in the flatwoods landscape group, 4 in the
   slough landscape group, and 1 in the depression landscape group.

   Data for 16 sites were fit to Horton's equation by using a regression
   analysis to estimate the infiltration rates of saturated soils. For
   some sites, an outlier value was removed prior to the regression
   analysis. Seven of the sites did not yield data that fit Horton's
   equation. The flatness of the plotted data suggests that saturated
   conditions may have been reached early in the test. The infiltration
   rate of saturated soils for these sites was estimated by averaging the
   data collected after the first 20 minutes of the test.

   For all sites, the estimated infiltration rates of saturated soils
   ranged from 9.8 to 115 centimeters per hour in flatwoods, 3.4 to 66
   centimeters per hour in rock, and 2.5 to 55 centimeters per hour in
   slough. The estimated soil infiltration rate at the one site in the
   depression was 181 centimeters per hour. Five sites were located on
   irrigation control berms where infiltration rates of the highly
   compacted and rocky soil may not represent the rates of less disturbed
   soils at sites within the same landscape groups.
