    Operational Mission

   The NOAA Ship RUDE (pronounced "Rudy") performs inshore hydrographic
   surveys along the northeast coast in support of NOAA's nautical
   charting mission, specializing in the location and accurate positioning
   of submerged hazards to navigation. The RUDE is named for Captain
   Gilbert T. Rude.

   RUDE is equipped with some of the most technically advanced
   hydrographic and navigation equipment available, including Differential
   Global Positioning Systems (DGPS), a Multibeam Bathymetric Sonar
   System, and Side Scan Sonar (SSS). The RUDE is equipped with several
   hydrographic data acquisition and data processing systems. She is also
   fully equipped for diving operations to allow determination of the
   precise nature of submerged obstructions.

   When conducting a search for an underwater obstruction, RUDE deploys a
   side scan sonar and multibeam bathymetric sonar system. Housed in a
   small torpedo-shaped shell called a "fish," the SSS provides an
   accurate acoustical image (sonogram) of the bottom extending up to 150
   meters on each side of the ship. The actual amount of bottom coverage
   acquired is dependent upon the depth of water, the towfish height and
   specific water characteristics. During typical survey operations in
   depths between 10 and 60 meters, a 200-meter wide bottom swath can be
   examined as the "fish" is towed slowly astern. All potential hazards to
   navigation identified using SSS are further investigated using the
   multibeam bathymetric sonar system and ship's divers to determine a
   precise description of the hazard and the minimum depth of clearance.

   At 90 feet and 220 tons displacement, RUDE is one of the smaller
   vessels in the NOAA Fleet. RUDE carries a 19-foot Boston Whaler used as
   a diving platform and personnel transport. A 21' Monark, transported by
   trailer, assists RUDE with inshore surveying.

   Aside from hydrographic surveying, RUDE is called upon to assist the
   U.S. Coast Guard and Navy in search, rescue, and recovery operations.
   The RUDE located the TWA flight 800 wreckage off of Moriches, NY in
   1996, and more recently, located John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane wreckage
   off Marthas Vineyard, MA.
