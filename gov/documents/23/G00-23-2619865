                 107th CONGRESS LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS

                               (Partial List)
    1. President Bush Signs Chairman Coxs Internet Tax Freedom Bill Into
       Law: President George W. Bush signed into law H.R. 1552, House
       Policy Chairman Christopher Coxs Internet Tax Non-Discrimination
       Act, on November 28, 2001. The new law extends through November 1,
       2003 the moratorium on new, special, and discriminatory Internet
       taxes that was originally enacted in 1998 and also authored by
       Chairman Cox.
    2. Environmental Victories for Orange County. Ten Orange County
       environmental projects sought by House Policy Chairman Christopher
       Cox were signed into law on November 12, 2001. Chairman Cox
       personally requested the measures from the House Appropriations
       Subcommittee on Energy and Water. From protecting endangered birds
       to restoring Newport Bay to replenishing safe drinking water, these
       environmental initiatives will help protect Orange Countys diverse
       environment and excellent water resources.
    3. Rep. Cox's Patient Protection Legislation Debated on House Floor:
       On August 2, 2001, House Policy Chairman Christopher Cox, author of
       heath care lawsuit legislation in four successive Congresses, saw
       his handiwork considered on the House floor. The debate came as
       part of the historic enactment of a far-reaching Patients Bill of
       Rights. Chairman Coxs amendment was the only amendment to the
       Ganske-Dingell bill, H.R. 2563, which was endorsed by the American
       Medical Association.
    4. Cleanup of Contaminated Groundwater at El Toro Base. On June 8,
       2001, the U.S. Navy agreed to pay $27.5 million to clean up the
       groundwater contamination caused by the U.S. military during the
       time it operated the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. This
       landmark agreement is the result of more than seven years of work
       by Rep. Cox and local officials to ensure that the Pentagon accepts
       liability for the toxic pollution it has caused at the base.
    5. Death Tax Repeal. After waging the fight to repeal the Death Tax
       for nearly a decade, House Policy Chairman Christopher Cox's Death
       Tax repeal legislation was signed into law by President George W.
       Bush on June 7, 2001.
    6. Promote High-Speed Internet Connections. Approved by the House
       Subcommittee on Telecommunications  and the Internet on April 26,
       2001. One Cox-authored amendment bars the Federal Communications
       Commission from imposing any taxes or fees on high-speed data
       services. A second Cox-authored amendment prohibits telephone
       companies from receiving unfair subsidies that are used to stifle
       competition in the high-speed data service marketplace.
    7. Unanimous and Bipartisan Multilateral Export Control Study. For
       seven months beginning September 2000, Chairman Cox co-chaired a
       House-Senate-Executive Branch Study Group on Multilateral Export
       Controls, which in April 2001 released bipartisan recommendations
       that would update the current export control system compatible with
       post-Cold War realities, but also more adaptable to advancements in
       technology.
    8. Recognizing the 90th Birthday of President Ronald Reagan. Approved
       by the House and Senate on Ronald Reagan's birthday--February 6,
       2001. Honors the significant legacies of former President Ronald
       Reagan. This legislation has the distinction of being the very
       first bill ever signed into law by George W. Bush, Public Law
       107-1.

                 106th CONGRESS LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS

                               (Partial List)
    1. No Predatory Internet Taxes. This Cox-authored bill, the Internet
       Non-Discrimination Act, was approved by the House on May 10, 2000
       by a 352-75 vote. Extends the moratorium on new, multiple, and
       discriminatory taxes on the Internet and electronic commerce that
       is currently in place as a result of a 1998 Cox-authored law, the
       Internet Tax Freedom Act. That moratorium remains in effect until
       October 2001; this latest Cox initiative seeks to extend it for an
       additional five years, through October 2006.
    2. A Global Tax-Free Internet. This landmark Cox-authored resolution
       was approved October 26, 1999 by the House on a 423-1 vote, and on
       November 19, 1999 by the Senate on a unanimous vote. Extends the
       principles behind Rep. Coxs 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act to the
       international arena so that the World Wide Web will be a global
       tariff-free zone. Calls on the President to negotiate with foreign
       governments for a permanent ban on tariffs on
       electronically-delivered products, and for a permanent ban on
       special, multiple, and discriminatory taxes on electronic
       commerce.
    3. Repeal of the Spanish-American War Tax. This top recommendation of
       the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, set up by Rep. Coxs
       Internet Tax Freedom Act, was approved by the full House on May 25,
       2000 in a 420-2 vote, and is expected to be signed into law by
       President Clinton this month. Eliminates the 3% federal excise tax
       on telephone calls, which adds $6 billion annually to consumers
       phone bills. The tax, first put in place in 1898 to fund the
       Spanish-American War, has today become a regressive tax on the
       on-ramp to the information superhighway.
    4. Protect Orange County from Severe Floods. Funding for flood control
       efforts on the Santa Ana Riverwhich began in 1989, Rep. Coxs first
       year in Congresswas secured for the 12th straight year in 2000.
       Progress on construction has been so successful that even before
       completion of the project, on September 30, 1999, the U.S. Army
       Corps of Engineers officially announced that the threat of flooding
       of the Santa Ana River in Orange Countyonce considered the biggest
       flood threat west of the Mississippihas been reduced so
       significantly that mandatory flood insurance will no longer be
       required for persons living in the flood plain. This is now saving
       30,000 Orange County homeowners a total of $12 million annually.
    5. Repeal of the Unfair Social Security Earnings Test. This billwhich
       Rep. Cox first sponsored in 1989, and in every Congress sincewas
       approved by the House on March 1, 2000, and enacted into law on
       April 7, 2000. Repeals the confiscatory earnings test, which
       reduced Social Security benefits for seniors who continue to work
       after retirement age. Repeal of the unfair earnings test will
       benefit more than 6,000 Orange County seniors by restoring $37
       million annually in retirement benefits.
    6. Orange County Coastal Environmental Restoration. This Cox
       initiative was included in the fiscal 2000 Energy and Water
       Appropriations bill passed September 27, 1999 by the House, and
       signed into law on September 29, 1999. Provides $3.4 million to
       improve environmental management and combat beach erosion along the
       Orange County coastline, including $1 million for the continuation
       of environmental restoration efforts for wetlands and estuaries in
       Upper Newport Bay.
    7. Cleanup of Contaminated Groundwater at El Toro Base. This Cox
       initiative was included in the fiscal 2000 Defense Department
       Appropriations bill passed October 13, 1999 by the House, and
       signed into law on October 25, 1999. Directs the Defense Department
       to accelerate its cleanup of the groundwater it contaminated
       beneath the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, and to undertake all
       necessary environmental remediation measures.
    8. Long-Term Preservation of Upper Newport Bay. This landmark
       Cox-authored initiative was approved by the House on October 19,
       2000, and will be signed into law by President Clinton by the end
       of the month. Establishes a 20-year, $21 million endowment fund to
       assist local efforts to dredge and ecologically improve the Upper
       Newport Bay, a 752-acre marine and shoreline wildlife habitat
       preserve that is home to a number of endangered and threatened
       species.
    9. Death Tax Repeal. Rep. Cox introduced the first Death Tax repeal
       bill in 1993, and worked to gain over 200 sponsors for it by 1998,
       when it was finally taken up by the Ways and Means Committee.
       Despite Clintons veto, Congressional approval for a second year in
       a row marked a significant step in Rep. Coxs multi-year effort to
       abolish this confiscatory tax on the after-tax life savings of
       hard-working Americans. Most recent action: the bill was approved
       by the House on June 9, 2000, and by the Senate on July 14, 2000;
       vetoed by Bill Clinton on August 31, 2000.
   10. Reduce Death Taxes for Leisure World Residents. Introduced on July
       13, 1999, this Cox-authored bill was signed into law on October 20,
       1999. The Fairness in Trusts and Estates Planning Act makes it
       possible for seniors in communities such as Leisure World who live
       with a co-op form of ownership to use a standard estate planning
       tool, the living trust, to save death taxes and avoid probate.
   11. Improved AIDS Treatment and Prevention. This Cox-sponsored bill was
       approved by the House on October 5, 2000. The Ryan White CARE Act
       Amendments places new emphasis on HIV prevention. The new law also
       corrects a disparity that had provided Orange County with more
       limited funding compared to several other areas of the nation.
   12. Anaheim City Jail Criminal Alien Screening Program. This
       Cox-authored legislation was included in the fiscal 2000 Commerce,
       Justice, State Appropriations bill passed November 18, 1999 by the
       House, and signed into law on November 29, 1999. Requires the
       Immigration and Naturalization Service to continue its successful
       program at the Anaheim City Jail for identifying and promptly
       deporting illegal aliens who have been arrested for other crimes.
   13. Restore the Mission at San Juan Capistrano. This Cox-sponsored
       initiative was enacted on October 20, 1999. Provides $1 million for
       restoration efforts to preserve the Great Stone Church at San Juan
       Capistrano, which has been named an American treasure by the
       National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Church, completed in
       1806 for Spanish missionaries, was severely damaged by an
       earthquake that also destroyed the churchs bell-tower.
   14. Outlaw State Discrimination Against California Wine. Approved
       August 3, 1999 by the House by voice vote, this Cox-authored
       legislation was presented to President Clinton for his signature on
       October 11, 2000. Prohibits any state that permits in-state direct
       shipments of wine or liquor to unfairly restrict direct shipments
       from out-of-state wine or liquor sellers. Makes it easier for
       adults in other states to purchase California wine.
   15. Improve Foster Care for Children. This Cox-sponsored initiative was
       approved by the House on November 18, 1999, and signed into law on
       December 14, 1999. Clarifies that non-profit and charitable groups
       that provide assistance to foster care youths are not adversely
       affected by the federal Independent Living Program. Promotes
       self-reliance for foster children rather than dependence on public
       assistance, by providing access to a wider variety of education and
       employment opportunities.
   16. Continued Community Access to the El Toro Base Property. Approved
       by the House on July 19, 2000, this Cox-authored law was signed by
       President Clinton on August 9, 2000. Provides $1.5 million to the
       County of Orange (for the costs of law enforcement and other
       caretaker responsibilities) to ensure the continuation of many
       important community and volunteer services now being conducted at
       the closed base.
   17. Fair Treatment of Persons With Severe Disabilities. This
       Cox-sponsored bill was approved by the House on October 11, 2000,
       and is expected to be signed into law by President Clinton this
       month. Removes an unfair barrier in U.S. immigration law that
       prevents persons with severe cognitive disabilities from ever
       becoming naturalized citizens. Inspired by the case of Vijai Rajan,
       a resident of Anaheim, California.
   18. No Forced Unionism for Doctors. This Cox-authored legislation was
       narrowly defeated by the House on June 29, 2000. It would ensure
       that no doctor will be forced to join a labor union against his or
       her will. This landmark vote represents the first time right to
       work legislation has ever been debated and voted on the floor of
       the House of Representatives.
   19. Prevent Y2K Injuries. This Cox-authored bill was approved on May
       12, 1999 by the House on a 236-190 vote, and signed into law on
       July 20, 1999. Ensured that the threat of litigation did not delay
       or complicate efforts to fix Year 2000 computer problems. Guarded
       against jackpot recoveries unrelated to any actual harm.
   20. Legalizing Digital Signatures. Approved by Rep. Coxs Commerce
       Committee on August 5, 1999, by the House on November 9, 1999 by a
       356-66 vote, and enacted into law on June 30, 2000. Ensures that
       electronic signatures will be considered just as legally valid as
       pen-and-ink signatures. Permits electronic signatures to serve the
       same function as a hand-written signature in verifying the
       identities of parties to a transaction.
   21. Bar the U.S. Postal Service from Managing Internet Domain Names.
       Rep. Cox personally defeated an October 1998 proposal by the U.S.
       Postal Service to take over the management and administration of
       the .us Internet domain. The Postal Service currently plays no role
       in managing Internet space; nor does such a role logically proceed
       from its charter to deliver letter mail and packages. Keeping the
       Postal Service from taking over management of the Internet was a
       significant victory for the new economy.
   22. Promote Democracy and Free Enterprise in Russia. As Chairman of the
       Speakers Advisory Group on Russia, released a 209-page report on
       September 20, 2000, reviewing the eight-year history of U.S. policy
       during the Yeltsin administration and making recommendations for
       the Putin era. The Advisory Group on Russia included as its members
       the chairmen of six full committees in the House.
   23. Protect Human Rights in Communist China. This landmark Cox-authored
       legislation was approved by the House on May 24, 2000, and signed
       into law on October 10, 2000. Establishes the first-ever mandatory,
       annual Congressional review of freedom and human rights in the
       People's Republic of China. Creates an independent commission to
       examine human rights in the PRC. Requires Congress to review a
       broad range of human rights, including religious freedom, the
       plight of political prisoners, and protections against arbitrary
       arrest and enforced exile.
   24. Unanimous, Bipartisan Report on Theft of Military Technology by the
       Peoples Republic of China. Served during the 105th and 106th
       Congress as Chairman of the Select Committee on Military/Commercial
       Concerns with the Peoples Republic of China. Top Secret report
       delivered on January 3, 1999. Unclassified report released to
       public on May 25, 1999. The intelligence community has repeatedly
       confirmed the key findings of the Committees report, including its
       conclusions about PRC espionage against the United States,
       weaknesses in our efforts to counter it, and threats to our
       national security. In September 1999, the CIA published
       unclassified portions of a National Intelligence Estimate
       confirming that Chinas future intercontinental missiles and their
       nuclear warheads will in key respects be based on stolen U.S.
       technology, as first reported by the Select Committee.
   25. Improving Counterintelligence at U.S. Weapons Labs. Approved June
       9, 1999 by a unanimous vote of the House of Representatives. Signed
       into law on October 5, as Public Law 106-65. Enacts 28 of the
       recommendations of the Select Committee on Military/Commercial
       Concerns with the Peoples Republic of China. Strengthens our
       counterintelligence program so that the United States most closely
       held military secrets will not be lost to our adversaries.
   26. Reorganization of Department of Energy; Creation of the National
       Nuclear Security Administration. This top recommendation of the Cox
       Committee has been signed into law by President Clinton. It
       completely reforms one-third of the Department of Energy, which was
       formerly charged with handling our nations nuclear secrets. In the
       most significant cabinet department reform in two decades, the new
       law created the National Nuclear Security Administration, an
       independent agency within the Department of Energy, to take over
       full responsibility for the nations nuclear weapons security.
   27. Taiwan Security Enhancement Act. As Chairman of the House Policy
       Committee, Rep. Cox re-wrote this leadership bill to assure its
       passage in the International Relations Committee and then in the
       House on February 1, 2000 by a 341-70 vote. Requires the U.S. to
       maintain military-to-military relations with democratic Taiwan that
       are at least as comprehensive as the military-to-military relations
       the U.S. currently maintains with the communist Peoples Republic of
       China. Reaffirms the U.S. commitment to provide Taiwan with the
       means to defend itself.
   28. Combat North Korean Nuclear Blackmail. Served as one of nine
       members of the North Korea Advisory Group, a task force appointed
       by the Speaker of the House to study the efficacy of the Clinton
       administrations initiation of foreign aid to the Communist
       dictatorship in North Korea. On November 3, 1999, the group issued
       its report, which concludes that North Korea is even more of a
       threat to U.S. national security than five years ago, and
       recommends urgent changes in U.S. policy.
   29. No Taxpayer Bailout of North Korea Nuclear Accidents. Approved by
       the House on May 18, 2000 on a 334-85 vote, this Cox
       legislationco-authored with Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA)overturns the
       Clinton administrations plan to put U.S. taxpayers at risk in the
       event of a nuclear power plant accident in North Korea. Prevents a
       further increase in unwise U.S. aid to the repressive North Korea
       regime to construct nuclear power plants capable of producing
       material for nuclear weapons.
   30. International Freedom Day. Approved November 9, 1999 in the House
       by a 417-0 vote, the Cox-authored initiative honors the memory of
       those whose efforts to repel Soviet Communist tyranny brought about
       the tearing down of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989.
       Establishes November 9 of every year as Freedom Day in the United
       States so that we might annually recognize the courage, dedication,
       and sacrifice of those who help fight to bring freedom to the
       people held captive by the Soviet Empire; calls on governments
       around the world to join in memorializing this historic date.
       Companion legislation in the Senate authored by Sen. Joe Lieberman
       (D-CT).

                     OTHER NOTEWORTHY COX-AUTHORED BILLS
                          NOT YET ENACTED INTO LAW
    1. Right to Choose Your Lawyer Act.  Ensures that individuals are free
       to decide for themselves whether or not to join as a plaintiff in a
       lawsuit. Protects the right of a person to know and consult with
       his or her own lawyer.
    2. Full Deductibility of Medical Expenses.  Introduced on July 27,
       2000. Permits 100% tax deductibility of the costs of medical
       insurance and all other medical expenses. Ensures equitable tax
       treatment of medical expenses, regardless of whether an individual
       is insured through an employer-provided health plan, buys insurance
       on his or her own, or pays for all medical bills out-of-pocket.
    3. Preserve Natural Habitats From Environmental Destruction. Rep. Cox
       introduced the Ecosystem and Indigenous Peoples Protection Act on
       September 29, 1999, and by the end of the 106th Congress had gained
       34 bipartisan sponsors, as well as the endorsements of several
       environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth, Environmental
       Defense Fund, and Rainforest Action Network. Increases pressure on
       the World Bank to follow its own environmental and human rights
       guidelines and conduct more rigorous environmental and human rights
       assessments. Ensures that U.S. taxpayers do not subsidize World
       Bank projects that cause environmental damage or forcibly displace
       indigenous people.
    4. Enforce Child Support Payments. Introduced on February 24, 1999;
       Congressional hearings held on May 19, 2000. Requires deadbeat
       parents to pay taxes on amounts of unpaid child support; allows
       custodial parents to deduct amounts of unpaid child support as a
       bad debt. Provides a strong incentive for every parent to pay child
       support in full and on time.
    5. Health Insurance Choice and Patient Protection Act. Gives
       individuals covered by managed care plans new health care choices,
       in addition to litigation options, for obtaining full compensation
       for medical injuries. Consumers can elect out-of-court options,
       such as arbitration and dispute resolution procedures, which
       provide for quicker recovery of damages without deduction of costly
       attorneys fees.
    6. Make the Internet Safer for Children. Encourages the zoning of
       pornographic and other objectionable content on the Internet, such
       as within a new top-level domain (such as .xxx or .sex) that is
       accessible only to adults. Makes it easier for concerned parents to
       restrict their childrens access to adult material on the Internet,
       while also avoiding infringing on the First Amendment rights of
       adults.
    7. Cleaner Air in Southern California. Introduced July 1, 1999.
       Repeals a provision in federal law that arbitrarily punishes
       Californias aggressive local clean air efforts. Permits Southern
       California to act more rapidly and fully to improve local air
       quality.
    8. Clean Up Toxic Pollution at Illegal Drug Laboratories. Rep. Cox
       introduced the Orphan Meth Lab Clean-Up Act to ensure drug
       traffickers, not taxpayers, pay for environmental clean-up of sites
       where illegal drugs are manufactured. Increases fines for persons
       convicted of illegally trafficking in methamphetamines. Dedicates
       fines collected from these criminals to offsetting the costs of
       cleaning up toxic wastes at abandoned (orphan) meth lab sites,
       which costs California taxpayers $10 million annually.
    9. Reduce Gasoline Prices. Introduced on March 15, 2000. Repeals the
       30% gas tax increase enacted in 1993 by the Clinton-Gore
       administration. Responds to consumer concern that federal and state
       gas taxes today add nearly 50 cents to the cost of every gallon of
       gasoline.
   10. Speed Provision of Aid to Earthquake Victims. Introduced on October
       5, 1999. Responds to published news reports that disaster relief to
       the people of Taiwan in the wake of the September 21, 1999
       earthquake was hindered or delayed because the Peoples Republic of
       China demanded that international aid agencies first obtain
       permission from Beijing. Calls on the President to help Taiwan gain
       full rights in the International Red Cross and other international
       humanitarian organizations in order to avoid bureaucratic delays,
       which cost lives, in the provision of disaster relief.
   11. Bring Tax Treatment of Computer Software into the 21st Century.
       Introduced on April 5, 2000. Permits small businesses to deduct the
       cost of computer software immediately rather than over an arbitrary
       period of three years, as provided in current law. Ensures the tax
       code treats a business software purchases just like any other
       ordinary and necessary business expense, such as the cost of rent
       or electricity.
   12. Accounting Rules for the Knowledge-Based Economy. Introduced on
       October 3, 2000. Imposes a one-year moratorium on the elimination
       of the pooling method of accounting for mergers, and commissions a
       more detailed study of the economic impact of this proposed change.
       Because the only other method of accounting for mergersthe purchase
       methodsignificantly discounts the value of intangible assets (such
       as employee knowledge, reputation, copyright and patents),
       elimination of the pooling option will make it difficult for
       high-tech start-ups and businesses in other knowledge-based
       industries to attract investment capital.
   13. Train Americas Workforce for the High-Tech Economy. With Rep. David
       Wu (D-OR), co-authored the Tech Smart pilot program to encourage
       businesses to provide higher education scholarship assistance to
       U.S. residents. Complements the existing H-1B visa program, which
       allows high-tech companies to temporarily employ foreign workers if
       there is a shortage of trained U.S. workers.

                 105th CONGRESS LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS

                               (Partial List)
    1. Keep the Internet Tax-Free. The Internet Tax Freedom Act, described
       by the New York Times as "crucial for fostering the continued
       growth of electronic commerce" and identified by Congressional
       Quarterly as one of the most significant laws of the 105th
       Congress, was signed into law on October 21, 1998. The Act prevents
       state and local governments from imposing special, multiple, or
       discriminatory taxes on the Internet and electronic commerce. It
       directs the Clinton Administration to take action internationally
       to keep foreign taxes and tariffs off the Internet.
    2. Require a Legally-Binding Budget. Rep. Cox's Budget Process Reform
       Act has more than 200 sponsors. It completely overhauls the 1974
       Budget Act to require a legally binding budget and provides
       numerous toolsincluding supermajority votes, Presidential line item
       reduction, and a ban on 'blank check' spendingto enforce spending
       limits in the budget law. It provides for a sustaining mechanism to
       continue government spending at the previous year's levels if the
       Congress and the President cannot agree on a budget. Rep. Cox has
       steadily gained broad bipartisan support for this landmark
       bill--building up to 111 cosponsors by 1990, to 124 cosponsors by
       1992, to 181 cosponsors by 1994, to more than 200 cosponsors today.
    3. Ensuring Patient Access to Life-Saving Medical Devices. Approved by
       the House on July 30, 1998. Signed into law on August 13, as Public
       Law 105-230. Ensures continued availability of "biomaterials," the
       raw materials needed to make pacemakers, heart valves, and other
       implantable medical devices. Halts frivolous lawsuits that have
       created a severe shortage in the availability of biomaterials, thus
       jeopardizing patients' access to life-saving medical devices.
    4. Agenda. Author, with Majority Leader Dick Armey, of the Majority
       Agenda for the 105th Congress.
    5. Back Bay Environmental Restoration. Approved September 30, 1997, as
       part of the fiscal 1998 Energy and Water Appropriations bill.
       Signed into law on October 13, as Public Law 105-62. Provides $1.27
       million for the continuation of environmental restoration efforts
       for wetlands and estuaries in Upper Newport Bay. (Follows approval
       of the Water Resources Development Act, signed into law on October
       12, 1996 as Public Law 104-303, to provide for these continued
       environmental restoration efforts.)
    6. Enforce Child Support Payments. The Child Support Enforcement Act
       was introduced February 27, 1997. It requires parents who are
       delinquent in child support payments to include unpaid amounts as
       gross income when calculating their tax liability and allows
       custodial parents a bad debt deduction for unpaid child support.
    7. INS/Anaheim City Jail Criminal Alien Screening Program. Approved by
       the House 410-2 on November 4, 1997. Signed into law on December 5:
       Public Law 105-14. Renews the successful Immigration and
       Naturalization program at the Anaheim City Jail for identifying and
       promptly deporting illegal aliens who have been arrested for other
       crimes. (Rep. Cox authored the initial pilot program, which was
       signed into law in September 1996.) Expands the pilot program to
       100 other city and county jails nationwide, including every jail in
       Orange County.
    8. Ensure the Integrity of the Judicial Selection Process. Adopted on
       February 18, 1997 by the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary
       Committee. Eliminates Congress' quasi-official reliance on the
       liberal American Bar Association for evaluating the political views
       of judicial nominees.
    9. Policy for Freedom. On November 9, 1997, the House completed action
       on the "Policy for Freedom," a comprehensive package of 11 bills to
       promote human rights, freedom, and free markets in Communist China
       and ensure security in East Asia. The bills passed by an average
       margin of 388-31. The "Policy for Freedom" includes a bill
       requiring classified and unclassified annual reports to Congress by
       the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of
       Investigation regarding spying in the U.S. by Communist China,
       including specifically industrial espionage, attempts to influence
       the media, and attempts to influence U.S. political, military, and
       economic affairs. The Annual Report legislation became law on
       November 16, 1997: Public Law 105-118. Other bills passed by the
       House address Communist China's human rights violations, its
       violent suppression of religion, its use of slave labor, its
       international purchases of nuclear technology, its arms sales to
       Iran, its policy of forced abortion, and its aggression toward
       Taiwan. Other House-approved bills in the package would end
       U.S.-taxpayer subsidized loans to the Communist regime, deny normal
       commercial treatment to Communist Chinese military-owned
       businesses, dramatically expand Radio Free Asia broadcasts, and
       call for Taiwan's admission to the World Trade Organization.
   10. Stop U.S. Taxpayer Aid to North Korean Military. Approved 418-0 on
       July 24, 1997, as amendment to fiscal 1998 Agriculture
       Appropriations bill, and included in the Conference Report on the
       bill, which was signed into law on November 18: Public Law 105-86.
       Prevents the diversion of U.S. hunger relief aid by North Korea's
       Stalinist government for use by Kim Jong-Il's military. Requires
       that food aid be distributed by private charitable organizations,
       not by the Communist government of North Korea.
   11. Campaign Reform. Authored nine-point House action plan for Campaign
       Reform agreed upon by reform advocates with widely varying
       approaches to the issue.
       Protecting Public Health in the Tobacco Settlement. Legislation
       introduced on October 24, 1997. Bans outrageous attorneys' fees in
       any national tobacco settlement, such as the $7,700 an hour fee
       sought by attorneys in Florida. Ensures that the maximum possible
       amount of money from any tobacco settlement can be used for better
       purposes, such as preventing children from taking up smoking.
   12. Environmental Oversight and Government Efficiency. As Vice Chairman
       of the Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Rep.
       Cox helped lead hearings to promote effective implementation of the
       Clean Air Act and faster government approval for life-saving drugs,
       medical devices, and therapies.

       Project. Approved March 19, 1996, by voice vote as part of the

       services such as UPS or FedEx to qualify for the Internal Revenue
       Service's "timely-mailing-as-timely-filing" rule, under which a tax
       document's postmark date is deemed to be its delivery date. The IRS
       was slow in implementing the new law, but it certified four
       delivery services four business days before April 15, 1997.
    4. Reduced Costs For Federal Construction Projects. Approved June 26,
       1996, by Science Committee. Approved July 23 by voice vote as
       "Corrections Day" measure. Signed into law on October 11: Public
       Law 104-289. Amends Metric Act of 1975 to promote more
       cost-effective metric conversion in federal construction projects
       by permitting increased flexibility in using metric measurements.
    5. U.S. Policy on Communist China. Approved June 27, 1996, by 411-7
       vote. House resolution urges formulation of new, more comprehensive
       U.S. policy toward China in the wake of Administration's decision
       to renew "Most Favored Nation" trade status for China. Requires

       legislation addressing China's human rights abuses, trade
       violations, military aggression and illegal arms sales.
    6. NATO Expansion. Approved July 23, 1996, by 353-65 vote. Affirms
       that it is in the interest of the United States that the
       formerly-captive nations of the Soviet Empire be integrated into
       the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Makes Poland, Hungary, and
       Czech Republic immediately eligible for transition aid, and urges
       support for NATO membership for Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia,

    8. Demilitarization of Russian Troops in Kaliningrad. Approved
       September 26, 1996, by voice vote. Calls attention to continued
       sizeable Russian military presence in Kaliningrad, which poses a
       threat to the freedom and stability of the entire Baltic region.

       and urges demilitarization and environmental restoration of
       Kaliningrad.
    9. Newport Bay Environmental Restoration. Approved September 26, 1996,

       continuation of ongoing environmental restoration efforts in Upper
       Newport Bay and several other wetland and estuary sites in Orange
       County. Allows for continued interim use of the LA-3 site (an
       offshore site used for disposal of silt and other dredged material
       from sites in Orange County) to accommodate the EPA's failure to
       complete the studies needed before the site can be permanently
       designated.
   10. No Baseline Budgeting. Approved January 4, 1995, by 421-6 vote.
       Abolishes "baseline budgeting," an accounting gimmick used by
       government big spenders to make the public believe that spending
       increases are actually spending cuts.

       "injured feelings" awards in medical cases to $250,000. Patterned
       after California's Medical Injury and Compensation Reform Act
       (MICRA), which has reduced health care costs for millions of
       Californians and ensured access to care.
       Repeal of Joint and Several Liability. Approved 263-164 March 9,
       1995. Replaces joint and several liability with a "fair share" rule
       for determining lawsuit damages. Ensures that someone who is found

       damages--not 100%.
   12. Securities Litigation Reform. Approved 325-99 March 8, 1995. Passed
       over Presidential veto in December by 68-30 vote in Senate, and by
       319-100 vote in House: Public Law 104-67. Curbs frivolous lawsuits
       filed with the sole intention of extorting settlements from
       companies whose stocks have fallen in value. Provides significant
       protections for plaintiffs against abuses by class action lawyers
       by protecting individuals and firms against harassing lawsuits,
       while ensuring that people with legitimate claims get to trial
       faster and receive a more significant recovery. (When San Diego
       strike suit lawyer Bill Lerach tried to repeal this law in
       California with Proposition 211, the voters vindicated the Cox
       reforms by a stunning 74-26% margin.)

       carpooling goals.
   19. Opposed Communist China's Campaign of Intimidation Against Taiwan.
       Approved March 19, 1996, by 369-14 vote. "Sense of Congress"
