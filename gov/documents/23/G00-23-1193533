   There will be no formal flight activity on today. SCM IOP launches will
   end at dusk on Sunday, formally ending the Integrated IOP. Shutdown of
   guest instrumentation will gradually take place. As mentioned
   yesterday, the NASA/GSFC scanning Raman lidar will remain on site for a
   few more days to do further comparisons with the CART Raman lidar
