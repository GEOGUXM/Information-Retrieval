                      Quality of Water Flowing into the
                  Quivira National Wildlife Refuge, Kansas

   The Quivira National Wildlife Refuge is an enhanced wetlands area
   located in the Rattlesnake Creek Basin in south-central Kansas and is
   managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Established as a
   National Wildlife Refuge in 1959, the area provides food, water, cover,
   and protection for many species of birds, wildlife, and fish. Several
   types of waterfowl take advantage of the refuge in their annual
   migration, including the endangered Whooping Crane. Since, 1959, the
   refuge has been enhanced and includes more than 30 marshes and ponds
   covering about 22,000 acres in Stafford, Reno, and Rice Counties.

   The importance of maintaining water supply to preserve valuable
   waterfowl habitat was recognized early on. A channel was constructed to
   permit Rattlesnake Creek to flow directly into the Little Salt Marsh,
   one of two large saline marshes in the refuge. Additional canals and
   ponds have since been constructed, providing the entire area with a
   dependable water supply. However, supply is still a problem in dry
   years, especially during late summer, when the water demands outweigh
   the water supply, specifically the flow of Rattlesnake Creek into
   Quivira National Wildlife Refuge. In a cooperative study with the
   Kansas Geological Survey, the U.S. Geological Survey developed a
   computer-based water budget model to assist U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service in determining the outcome of possible water-management
   options. The results of this study were published in "Simulation of
   Canal and Control-Pond Operation at the Quivira National Wildlife
   Refuge, South-Central Kansas".

   Because of the considerable wildlife benefits offered by the refuge,
   there is a strong desire to provide a good water-quality supply to the
   refuge. Streamflow, river stage, and water quality flowing into the
   National Wildlife Refuge, are being monitored by the U.S. Geological
   Survey at Rattlesnake Creek near Zenith, Kansas. Temperature, specific
   conductance, pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity are being monitored
   with a continuously recording water-quality monitor. In addition, both
   routine quarterly and event-related water-quality samples were
   collected and analyzed for selected constituents including major ions,
   total and dissolved metals, nutrients, selected pesticides, and
   bacteria. The monitoring has identified temporal trends in selected
   water-quality constituents and is being used to estimate the chemical
   mass loading into Quivira National Wildlife Refuge.
