   Otherwise, for matter not in the public domain and in the absence of a
   valid fair use claim (but without limitation to trademark and other

   advertising or solicitation for products or services without the United
   States Mint's advance written permission. You also agree not to
   transmit, post, or distribute anything that is obscene, libelous,
   abusive, vulgar, threatening, discourteous or otherwise objectionable,
   violates any law or rights of any party, or a virus or other harmful
   material. Users are solely liable for any damage resulting from any

   any advertisement, circular, book, pamphlet, or other publication,
   play, motion picture, broadcast, telecast, or other production, in a
   manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such
   advertisement, circular, book, pamphlet, or other publication, play,
   motion picture, broadcast, telecast, or other production, is approved,
   endorsed, or authorized by or associated in any manner with, the United
   States Mint (text as of 10/00). Nothing in these terms of service or on

   provides for the assessment of civil penalties against any party who
   uses, in connection with, or as a part of, any advertisement,

   other words, letters, symbols, or emblems--the words ' 'Department of
   the Treasury," "United States Mint," U.S. Mint," ''Treasurer of the
   United States,'' "Director of the United States Mint," or the title of
   any other officer or employee of the Department of the Treasury, or any
   colorable imitation of any such words, titles, abbreviations, initials,
   symbols, or emblems, in a manner which could reasonably be interpreted
   or construed as conveying the false impression that such advertisement,
   solicitation, business activity, or product is in any manner approved,
   endorsed, sponsored, or authorized by, or associated with, the
   Department of the Treasury, the United States Mint, or any other
   Treasury entity or any officer or employee thereof.
