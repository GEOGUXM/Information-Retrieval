                                Introduction

   The Tropical Dynamics and Climate Group of NOAA's Aeronomy Laboratory
   has been operating Wind Profiling Radars, or Wind Profilers, at several
   sites worldwide for many years. From this web site, interested
   researchers can download post-processed, quality-controlled wind and
   temperature profiles.

   The database of profiler measurements contained herein consists of
   observations from the Aeronomy Lab's Trans-Pacific Profiler Network,
   the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere - Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere
   Response Experiment, TOGA-COARE, and other profiler sites.

   Included on this page are
     * A description of how the data was obtained, processed, and
       formatted in the database
     * An inventory of available data sets.
     * The Data Download page.
     * A list of contacts and references, including the Tropical Profiler
       Research Publications database (updated quarterly).
