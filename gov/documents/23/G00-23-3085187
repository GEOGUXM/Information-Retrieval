                     Forecast of Contract Opportunities

                            for Fiscal Year 2002

   The procurements described in this forecast are expected to have a
   solicitation released in fiscal year 2002 and subsequent fiscal years
   as indicated for each action. The item descriptions are based on the
   best information available at the time of publication.

   All projected procurements are subject to revision or cancellation.
   Final decisions on the extent of competition, small business
   participation, estimated value, or any aspect of the procurement action
   will not be made until each procurement is initiated. The forecast data
   is for planning purposes, does not represent a pre-solicitation
   synopsis, does not constitute an invitation for bid or request for
   proposal, and is not a commitment by the Government to purchase the
   desired products and services.

   The forecast is divided by Treasury bureau. Links to each bureau
   listing of existing contracts and new contract opportunities are
   provided below.  In FY 2001, the federal government moved to the North
   American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) for procurement
   classifications. For additional information, including a SIC/NAICS
   conversion chart, please visit www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html.
