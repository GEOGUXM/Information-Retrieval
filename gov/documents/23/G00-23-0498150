                  Welcome to the Pioneer Project Home Page.

   Launched on 2 March 1972, Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to travel
   through the Asteroid belt, and the first spacecraft to make direct
   observations and obtain close-up images of Jupiter. Famed as the most
   remote object ever made by man, Pioneer 10 is now over 7.3 billion
   miles away (Until 17 February 1998, the heliocentric radial distance of
   Pioneer 10 had been greater than that of any other manmade object. But
   late on that date Voyager 1's heliocentric radial distance, in the
   approximate apex direction, equaled that of Pioneer 10 at 69.419 AU.
   Thereafter, Voyager 1's distance will exceed that of Pioneer 10 at the
   approximate rate of 1.016 AU per year). The spacecraft made valuable
   scientific investigations in the outer regions of our solar system
   until the end of its mission on 31 March 1997. The Pioneer 10 weak
   signal continues to be tracked by the DSN as part of a new advanced
   concept study of chaos theory. Pioneer 10 is headed towards the
   constellation of Taurus (The Bull). It will take Pioneer over 2 million
   years to pass by one of the stars in the constellation.

   Launched on 5 April 1973, Pioneer 11 followed its sister ship to
   Jupiter (1974), made the first direct observations of Saturn (1979) and
   studied energetic particles in the outer heliosphere. The Pioneer 11
   Mission ended on 30 September 1995, when the last transmission from the
   spacecraft was received. Its electrical power source exhausted, the
   spacecraft could no longer operate any of its scientific instruments,
   nor point its antenna toward Earth. The spacecraft is headed toward the
   constellation of Aquila (The Eagle), Northwest of the constellation of
   Sagittarius. Pioneer 11 may pass near one of the stars in the
   constellation in about 4 million years.

  Pioneer Project History

   The Pioneer 10 & 11 Spacecraft Missions are two of a series of eight
   spacecraft missions managed by the Pioneer Project Office at NASA, Ames
   Research Center. The following is a brief description of the other
   Pioneer Missions.

    Pioneer 6-9

   Pioneers 6-9 were launched into Solar orbit between 1965 and 1968.
   Their prime mission completed years ago, the spacecraft were then
   tracked only occasionally.

   Pioneer 6 was launched on 16 December 1965. Some time after 15 December
   1995 (almost 30 years after it was launched) the primary transmitter
   (TWT) failed. During a track on 11 July 1996 the spacecraft was
   commanded to switch to the backup TWT, and the downlink signal was
   re-acquired. The spacecraft and a few of the science instruments were
   again functioning.

   Pioneer 6 was featured on the Star Date radio broadcast by the
   University of Texas McDonald Observatory on 16 December 2000 - the 35th
   anniversary of its launch. Pioneer 6 is the oldest NASA spacecraft
   extant. There was a successful contact of Pioneer 6 for about two hours
   on 8 December 2000 to commemorate its anniversary.

   Pioneer 7 was launched on 17 August 1966. It was last tracked
   successfully on 31 March 1995. The spacecraft and one of the science
   instruments were still functioning.

   Pioneer 8 was launched on 13 December 1967. Its primary TWT failed
   several years ago, but on 22 August 1996 the spacecraft was commanded
   to switch to the backup TWT, and the downlink signal was re-acquired.
   The spacecraft and one of the science instruments were again
   functioning.

   Pioneer 9 was launched on 8 November 1968. The spacecraft failed in
   1983.

    Pioneer Venus

   The Pioneer Venus Orbiter spacecraft was launched on 20 May 1978. It
   orbited the planet Venus for 14 years until it entered the Venus
   atmosphere on 8 October 1992 and was destroyed.

   The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe spacecraft was launched on 8 August 1978.
   Three small probes, one large probe, and the spacecraft bus entered the
   Venus atmosphere on 9 December 1978.
