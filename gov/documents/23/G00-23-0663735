   Astrobiology

   Earth, A Home for Life

   Astrobiology Our tiny planet circles an average sun, providing a stable
   home for life in all its countless forms. Flowering trees, hairy
   tarantulas, translucent bacilli, elephant families, and sea anemones --
   all share the sustaining environment of Earth.

   Life thrives, flagrant and abundant, even in unimaginably hostile
   places. We find it in the atom-splitting core of nuclear reactors, in
   the barren interior of desert rocks, at sea depths never touched by
   sunlight, inside lava-spewing volcanos, and in vast sheets of frigid
   arctic ice. Almost everywhere we look, life has found a place to
   flourish.

   Considering the Possibility of Life Beyond Earth

   It is not such a big stretch, then, to wonder about the potential for
   life elsewhere in the Universe. Among the billions of stars swirling in
   our galaxy alone, surely some might have planets that could harbor
   life.
   But if life arose elsewhere, under what conditions? Would it look like
   us and other organisms on our planet? How could we be sure we'd
   recognize life if we found it?

   Astrobiology is Our Key to Understanding Life and its Possibilities

   Astrobiology is the study of life in the Universe. It's a new field of
   research that covers the origin, evolution, distribution, and destiny
   of life--wherever it might exist.

   The great news about astrobiology is that almost anyone can
   participate, as it draws on biology, chemistry, geology, astronomy,
   computer science and a number of wide-ranging disciplines. Universities
   are even beginning to add this exciting new field as a degree in which
   people can major. Now and in the future, Students of Life will be
   focused on ten astrobiology goals:
     * GOAL ONE:     How Life Arose on Earth
     * GOAL TWO:    Organization of Matter into Living Systems
     * GOAL THREE:    How Life Evolves
     * GOAL FOUR:    Coevolution of the Biosphere and Earth
     * GOAL FIVE:    Limits for Life
     * GOAL SIX:    Habitable Planets
     * GOAL SEVEN:    Signatures of Life on Other Worlds
     * GOAL EIGHT:    Life on Mars and Europa
     * GOAL NINE:     Environmental Change on Earth
     * GOAL TEN:    Terrestrial Life in Space

   To learn more about these goals, see NASA's Astrobiology Roadmap.
