   About The WRDA Program

           Through the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of
   1972, Congress sought to regulate, and in some instances prohibit, the
   dumping of materials into ocean waters. In the mid-1980s, concerns over
   the dumping of dredge materials at the Mud Dump Site, an area
   approximately 5 miles off the coast of Sandy Hook, New Jersey, led
   Congress to enact Section 211 of the Water Resources Development Act
   (WRDA) of 1986.   In 1989, public concern increased over continued
   dumping at the Mud Dump Site and over other unregulated waste dumping
   off the New York and New Jersey shores (including some sporadic yet
   highly-publicized episodes of offshore dumping of medical wastes). This
   led Congress to revise the  procedures for discontinuing dumping at the
   Mud Dump Site. To that effect, through the Water Resources Development
   Act of 1990, Congress repealed section 211 of the previous Act and
   mandated the quick preparation of a final report for finding an
   alternative to the Mud Dump Site, one that was at least 20 miles off
   the shore of New Jersey. The 1990 Act also mandated the preparation of
   a plan for the long-term disposal of dredged material from the New
   York/New Jersey Harbor region, including the increased use of
   decontamination technologies and the possibilities of non-ocean
   disposal of such material. Later, Congress enacted the Water Resources
   Development Act of 1996 in order to begin a pilot program that would
   implement these decontamination technologies. This program is
   continuing today, and is on a course toward the preparation of a final
   report in late 1998.
