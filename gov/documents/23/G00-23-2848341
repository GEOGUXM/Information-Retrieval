      The USGS administers a variety of programs in the Caribbean. In
      addition to Water Resources work, studies of tectonics, marine geology,
      biology, and geography are in progress. Some of these are highlighted
      below.

      [earthquake.gif] Earthquake Hazards Program: The USGS Earthquake
      Hazards Program is part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction
      Program (NEHRP) lead by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
      The USGS role in NEHRP is to provide Earth sciences information and
      products for earthquake loss reduction. The goals of the USGS
      Earthquake Hazards Program are to improve earthquake hazard
      identification and risk assessment methods and their use; maintain and
      improve comprehensive earthquake monitoring in the United States and
      its territories; and to improve the understanding of earthquake
      occurrence and their effects and consequences. In addition, the USGS
      operates a seismic station in Cayey, Puerto Rico. To obtain information
      about earthquakes in the Caribbean, visit the Current Seismicity for
      Mexico - Central America - Caribbean web page.

      [montserrat.gif] Soufriere Hills Volcano: During unrest and the early
      stages of the current eruptive episode of the Soufriere Hills Volcano,
      a team from the USGS/USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance
      (OFDA), Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) based at the
      Cascades Volcano Observatory; assisted the Seismic Research Unit of the
      University of the West Indies to install and operate a monitoring
      network at Soufriere Hills Volcano. For the past several years,
      monitoring of the volcano and assessment of hazards have been the
      responsibility of the Montserrat Volcano Observatory. The volcano sits
      on the north flank of the older South Soufriere Hills volcano, located
      at the south end of Montserrat Island in the Lesser Antilles, eastern
      Caribbean. The summit area consists primarily of a series of
      east/southeast-trending lava domes. The volcano is 915 meters (3,010
      feet) high and began the current eruptions on July 18, 1995.

      Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands:
      Many earthquakes and tsunamis have occurred in the northeastern
      Caribbean, where the movements of the Earth's surface plates are rapid
      and complicated. Future such events pose serious hazards to the 4
      million people who live in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
      Work on this and related topics is in progress by the U.S. Geological
      Survey - Geology in the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands.

      Several abstracts related to tectonics in the Caribbean are available
      online.

      Research in the U.S. Virgin Islands includes coordinating and
      participating in a number of programs for long-term research and
      monitoring. More information is available at the U.S. Geological Survey
      Field Station--Biological Resources, Virgin Islands National Park, St.
      John, U.S. Virgin Islands Web Site.

      Photo - Brown frog Southeastern Amphibian Research and Monitoring
      Initiative: The problem of declining amphibian populations has been
      recognized world wide, with credible reports of declines or
      disappearances from many regions and habitat types.  No single cause
      has been demonstrated, although acid precipitation, environmental
      contaminants, the introduction of exotic predators, disease agents,
      parasites, and the effects of ultraviolet radiation have been suggested
      to be involved. Habitat loss has been and continues to be a major
      factor. In the United States, amphibian declines of unknown origin were
      first reported on the island of Puerto Rico and in the western States,
      where many populations tend to be small and isolated. More information
      is available at the U.S. Geological Survey Field Station - Biological
      Resources, Virgin Islands National Park, St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands
      Web Site.

      Caribbean Science Center´s Sirenia Project conducts long-term, detailed
      studies on the life history, population dynamics, and ecological
      requirements of the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus). Sirenia
      Project biologists work cooperatively with federal and state
      researchers and managers on research identified as essential for the
      recovery of the species. For more information, see the U.S. Geological
      Survey Florida Caribbean Science Center, Gainesville, Florida Web Site.

      possible that Saharan dust, deposited in the western Atlantic, plays a
      role in coral die offs in the Caribbean. Work on this and related
      topics is in progress by the U.S. Geological Survey Center for Coastal
      Geology and Regional Marine Studies, St. Petersburg, Florida.
