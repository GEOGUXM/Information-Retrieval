   Account Request

   First, you must verify with your third-party ISP (Internet Service
   Provider) that they will allow the VPN (Virtual Private Networking)
   protocol on their network. If they do not allow it, then the NIH VPN
   Service will not work for you.

   Second, You must have a valid NIH VPN account to access NIH locations
   which are available to you but are not accessible when you are
   connected to a third-party ISP. When your VPN account is established,
   you will need the VPN client application. Please call TASC to obtain a
   valid NIH VPN account and application software.

   VPN account information required by the application will include:

   Login Name: "VPN User Name"
   Shared Secret: "provided"
   Radius Password: "provided"
   Primary VPN Server Address: "provided"

   Changing Your Radius Password

   http://vpn.net.nih.gov/cs and logging on with your assigned Radius
   Password. You will be prompted for a new password and a confirmation.

   For Internet Explorer users: Upon submitting, your password will be
   changed and you will be logged out.
