   Developer Documentation

   Since there are many good tutorials out there for using JDBC and they
   should work with any JDBC driver, I will point novice JDBC developers
   to them rather than re-invent the wheel.

     * Getting Started with JDBC (from JavaSoft, start here)
     * JDBC - A Persistant Storage for Java Objects

   MM.MySQL Specific Documentation

   This document used to have a short synopsis of what was required to get
   the driver up and running. There is now a better document included in
   this distribution in the mm.doc directory, named book1.html. This is
   created from DOCBOOK sources, and although still a work in progress, is
   much more complete than the documentation that originally came with the
   driver.
