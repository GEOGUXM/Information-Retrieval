   New! A Tour of the FDA -- A web-based course providing basic
   information about FDA along with quizzes to test your knowledge. The
   course was developed under a Cooperative Research and Development
   Agreement between FDA and EduNeering, Inc.

   Every day, every American comes in contact with a host of products
   regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), everything from
   the most common food ingredients to complex medical and surgical
   devices, lifesaving drugs, and radiation-emitting consumer and medical
   products. In fact, FDA-regulated products account for about 25 cents of
   every consumer dollar spent in the United States.

   Stated most simply, FDA's mission is to promote and protect the public
   health by helping safe and effective products reach the market in a
   timely way, and monitoring products for continued safety after they are
   in use. Our work is a blending of law and science aimed at protecting
   consumers.

   FDA's top official is Bernard A. Schwetz, D.V.M., Ph.D., Acting
   Principal Deputy Commissioner.

   Here are some resources to help you learn more about FDA and the people
   who make up the Agency:
