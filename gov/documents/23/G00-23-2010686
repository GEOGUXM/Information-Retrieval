                        Surface-Water Data Collection

   PROBLEM:
   Surface-water information is needed for purposes of surveillance,
       planning, design, hazard warning, operation, and management, in
       water-related fields such as water supply, hydroelectric power,
       flood control, irrigation, bridge and culvert design, wildlife
       management, pollution abatement, flood-plain management, and water
       resources development. To provide this information an appropriate
       data base of streamflow information is necessary.

   OBJECTIVE:
    1. To collect surface-water data sufficient to satisfy needs for
       current-purpose uses, such as 1) assessment of water resources, 2)
       operation of reservoirs or industries, 3) forecasting, 4) disposal
       of wastes and pollution controls, 5) discharge data to accompany
       water-quality measurements, 6) compact and legal requirements, and
       7) research or special studies.
    2. To collect data necessary for analytical studies to define for any
       location the statistical properties of, and trends in, the
       occurrence of water in streams, lakes, estuaries, etc., for use in
       planning and design.

   APPROACH:
   Standard methods of data collection will be used as described in the
       series, "Techniques of Water Resources Investigations of the United
       States Geological Survey." Partial-record gaging will be used
       instead of complete-record gaging where it serves the required
       purpose.

   STATUS:
   Ongoing
