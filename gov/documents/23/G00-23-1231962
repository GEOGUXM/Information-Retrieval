   Nonproliferation and International Security

   Terry Hawkins
   NIS Division Director

Welcome to NIS

   [hawkins.jpg] The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the
   means to deliver them remain major national security issues despite the
   end of the Cold War. The Nonproliferation and International Security
   (NIS) Division and its associated program offices report to the
   Associate Laboratory Director for Threat Reduction and have primary
   Laboratory responsibility for responding to proliferation threats
   involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Our missionto develop and
   apply preeminent science and technology to deter, detect, and respond
   to proliferation and to ensure U.S. and global securitychallenges our
   very best scientists and engineers to seek innovative solutions to
   highly complex technical problems. Because we are science-based, we
   work with many researchers in universities and other laboratories in
   the U.S. and around the world. We work especially closely with our
   colleagues at Sandia and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. This
   tri-lab relationship has helped to make the Department of Energy's
   programs in nonproliferation and international security highly
   efficient and productive. The dedicated people of NIS are proud to play
   a major role in reducing the global nuclear danger.
