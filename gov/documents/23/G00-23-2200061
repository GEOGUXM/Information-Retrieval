                       Chesapeake Bay Fishing Charters

                               [grape_vi.gif]

   [star.gif] Small, 6 to 10 person fishing charters for striped bass,
   flounder, sea trout, and other bottom fish are made routinely for
   members of the Fishing Club. We charter with a Charter boat from
   Chesapeake Beach, which has provided our Club with good fishing for
   over the past 3 years. Trips are half-day and are during the week to
   avoid the water overcrowding. Cost is approximately $60.00. Trip
   leaders receive a $5 discount. Also, everyone that participates in our
   Chesapeake charters is eligible to win the "largest fish of the year"
   tournament. The largest edible fish (in length), caught during the 2001
   fishing season shall win a free trip in the following year. So far, the
   largest is an (insert your fish here) inch rockfish.

   If you're interested in getting on our charter list, or if you would
   like to be a trip leader for a charter, contact any Fish Club Staff
   Respresentative.

   Currently as of April 19th, we have scheduled one Trolling Trip. No
   further trip are planned until we have a chance as a Club to discuss
   fishing opportunities with several boat captains. Chumming trips would
   begin late June, or early July.
