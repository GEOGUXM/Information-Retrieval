   November 2001
     * All planned flight detectors are delivered and in-house.
     * Flight detector testing is proceeding as quickly as possible to
       support the detector enclosure build schedule. One flight CCD was
       damaged during testing, and is being returned to Marconi for
       analysis.
     * Optical bench integration proceeding well at Ball, but is somewhat
       constrained due to resource contention with ACS returning to Ball
       for a final RAS/HOMS test.
     * The first engineering Main Electronics Box completed.
     * IR cold enclosure passes qualification testing.
     * Descope planning process reactivated in response to continuing
       budgetary pressures on HST.

   October 2001
     * Successful installation and alignment of the optical bench onto the
       WFAS system.
     * Detector electrical isolation issues resolved.
     * UVIS "air gap" filters successfully manufactured. Filter deliveries
       continue are still late, but sufficient quantities are being
       delivered to maintain schedule.
     * IR cold enclosure qualification testing under way.
     * Flight detector testing "heats up" at the DCL and at Ball (for the
       CCDs).
     * 14th SOC meeting held at STScI for a successful CCD Detector
       Milestone Review. The first pair of CCDs for the flight builds was
       selected. The SOC reviewed and approved several internal descopes.

   September 2001
     * The optical bench was shipped to Ball at the start of the month!
       This is a major milestone which enables the Ball team to start
       integrating the optics, electronics, and detectors.  The next 12
       months will be exciting indeed, culminating in the delivery of the
       bench with all the goodies back to GSFC for instrument-level
       integration.
     * Received the last three engineering unit IR focal planes from RSC.
       One of these devices, #31, is of exceptional quality and is likely
       to be a flight unit.  We have now received all 12 of 12 engineering
       unit deliveries.  Three flight deliveries are expected next month.
     * The flight spare IR enclosure has completed its qualification
       testing.
     * Received two additional Marconi flight CCD. Two were expected and
       two were received. Marconi has now delivered 4 of 6 flight CCDs,
       with the rest expected next month.
     * The TECFIRE subsystem tests revealed an anomaly that was eventually
       traced to a bad solder joint.  Processes are being improved to
       prevent recurrence.
     * A better adhesive has been identified for use with the UVIS filters
       from Barr (to solve some structural concerns with the air-gap
       design).
     * A major system engineering effort to update the verification
       matrix, risk list, and descope list has been completed.

   August 2001
     * Testing of the optical bench has completed.  All anomalies have
       been traced to test setup issues, with the result that the bench
       meets or exceeds performance requirements in all areas.  These
       additional tests have delayed the bench shipment to Ball which had
       been scheduled for the end of this month.
     * An internal project integration readiness review was completed for
       the Ball activities in the coming months.
     * The IR filter followup telecon for the Filter Milestone Review was
       completed successfully.
     * All IR filters are received from the vendors.
     * UVIS filter deliveries continue to be a challenging area.  In
       particular, the UV filter design with epoxy fill is suspected to be
       the cause of throughput degradation, and an air-gap design is being
       developed.
     * Some of the requirements on the narrow-band UVIS filters have been
       relaxed to help expedite delivery.
     * A CCD Process Review was held to examine the processing risks for
       installing the Marconi detectors into the Ball enclosure.  The
       recommendations are being incorporated into our planning.
     * A few weeks of the Marconi CCD testing for the high temperature
       soak had been at 150C instead of 110C.  This has been corrected.
       The intermediate results look very encouraging, with little change
       noticeable after 2 weeks of high temperature soak.
     * IR FPA #18 has completed characterization, and was shipped to Ball
       for the IR Qualification Enclosure build.
     * The Optical Stimulus work has moved from the GSFC Building 20 SLAC
       facility (deintegration and metrology) to the Orbital facility in
       Beltsville for reintegration and testing.

   July 2001
     * The optical bench testing at GSFC revealed a few anomalies which
       are being investigated.
     * The first two (of six) Marconi flight CCDs arrive at the DCL.
     * One of the two Marconi delivered engineering devices has been
       retained at Marconi for the high temperature soak test at 110C.
     * Received another three engineering unit IR focal planes from RSC.
       These are of almost flight quality, and will be handled in a manner
       that will allow them to be used as flight devices if necessary.
     * Ball took the first images of the IR surrogate detector (bare mux)
       using the engineering model Detector Electronics Box (DEB).
     * The 6-stage TECs were delivered to Ball for the IR enclosure.
       There are some questions about their efficiency, and additional
       units are being procured.
     * The UVIS filter followup telecon for the Filter Milestone Review
       was completed successfully.  While we still have some stragglers
       for the filters, the review panel has expressed confidence that the
       normal processes within the project will be successful at dealing
       with these challenges.
     * All optics metallized coatings are completed.

   June 2001
     * The optical bench arrives at GSFC!  Vibration and metrology tests
       have begun and look great.
     * Marconi delivers the first engineering units for WFC3, as well as
       two red-coated devices for ACS (a little ahead of schedule).
     * Received another three engineering unit IR focal planes from RSC.
       One of these is near flight quality.IR FPA #15 tests at the DCL
       confirm the ultra-low dark current.  Other detailed characteristics
       of this device have been measured and are being discussed with
       RSC.  Delays in the IR Qualification Detector Enclosure need date
       allows us to select a more recent RSC delivery, FPA #18, for
       delivery to Ball for the build.  This will allow for more detailed
       testing on FPA #15.
     * We successfully held the first WFC3 Milestone Review for the
       filters during the 13th SOC meeting on June 11-13.  The SOC was
       pleased with the results.  We will have a followup meeting at the
       end of July after all of the filters have been received.
     * All powered optics received from Tinsley.

   May 2001
     * Optical bench cold plate delivered to GSFC.
     * Optical bench delayed to accommodate some rework.
     * RSC delivered the last two IR muxes (with Kovar pins) to the DCL.
       DCL characterized mux M10, and delivered it to Ball for the IR
       Detector Surrogate Enclosure.
     * CCD devices #188 and #165 delivered to Ball for the CCD Surrogate
       Enclosure.
     * CCD #153 irradiated.  Ready for post-irradiation characterization.
     * Meeting held at Marconi to review the data packages for Batch 4
       devices.
     * Working with Barr on detailed prioritization and planning for
       deliveries. The first IR filters arrived.  UVIS deliveries
       on-going.
     * After failure of the ACS Fairchild CCDs in Build 3', the HST
       Project decided to use 4 WFC3 wafers from Marconi Batch 4 for ACS.
       These will be coated red and delivered to ACS for Build 3''.
       Delivery is accelerated (by July) to accommodate the ACS schedule.
       Impacts on WFC3 are non-negligible but manageable, and are being
       assessed.  Net result is a delay of 2 months for the final WFC3
       flight devices (intermediate deliveries are less affected).

   April 2001
     * Optical bench assembly is proceeding well. All the parts have been
       made and are being assembled.
     * Delivery to GSFC is scheduled for next month. (See our latest
       images).
     * TECFIRE Peer Review completed. All thermal systems designs are now
       complete.
     * Received 3 engineering unit IR focal planes from RSC. One of these
       devices is claimed to have extremely good dark current (but
       somewhat low QE) according to RSC testing. The DCL will confirm and
       provide feedback to RSC for future lots. The 2 Kovar pin muxes for
       the IR surrogate enclosure have been received and will be tested at
       the DCL before delivery to Ball.
     * One Marconi engineering device from Batch 4 has been measured. All
       parameters are better than required for flight! QE is not yet
       measured, pending completion of the test setup commissioning. The
       charge injection feature has been characterized for (front-side
       engineering device) #152. Performance before irradiation is very
       promising. It will be irradiated next month.
     * The overall WFC3 Project schedule is being replanned for the
       November 2003 launch. This replan will be completed next month.

   March 2001
     * Final design review for the Optical Stimulus completed.
     * Additional flight-like packaged WFC3-1R muxes received. The first
       flight engineering model deliveries renegotiated due to lateness of
       Kovar pins. Deliveries staggered into April. Testing at Rockwell
       show very promising results.
     * Marconi Batch 3 devices did not make it through backside
       processing. First deliveries delayed by one month.
     * Decided to use frontside Marconi devices for the UVIS surrogate
       detector buildup (take out the SITe devices from ACS "qual unit
       2").
     * WFC3 program plan being reassessed given new phasing constraints.
     * Additional CEB/DEB for the DCL descoped.
     * Instrument grounding design started and being reviewed.

   February 2001
     * 12th SOC meeting at Ball. Discussed WFC3 milestone reviews and
       descope plans. The next SOC meeting will be the Filter Milestone
       Review in June.
     * Received the first optics (IR M1 and M2) from Tinsley. They look
       excellent.
     * Completed the first fit checks of the Optical Bench mockup and
       instrument Enclosure.
     * Flight filter deliveries from the manufacturers started (to JPL and
       GSFC for characterization).
     * Redundant CSM ruled out. DCL reorganization started due to staffing
       changes.

   January 2001
     * Characterization of the first pin-grid array WFC3-1R multiplexers
       completed and one device has been shipped to Ball for testing.
     * Received the first flight-like packaged WFC3-1R mux.
     * Marconi Batch 3 devices look very promising after the first cold
       tests.
     * Studies being completed for a redundant CSM.
     * The ACS/WFC3 "common spare" detector enclosure is in fabrication.
       The Optical Bench mockup went to the AAS.
