   Background

   The primary mission of the NOAA Diving Program is to ensure safety of
   all NOAA diving operations. To directly influence this mission
   objective, the NOAA Diving Program created the Standardized Equipment
   Program (SEP).

   Prior to the Standardized Equipment Program, the procurement of diving
   equipment had been left up to the individual or their unit. Students
   attending NOAA diver training programs with faulty dive equipment was
   observed at an increasing rate. Personal preference, misinformation,
   and inadequate funding often resulted in the purchase of inadequate
   diving equipment and improper maintenance within units. NOAA Diving
   Program (NDP) inspection of field unit diving lockers often revealed
   sub-standard diving equipment, inadequate maintenance, and equipment
   used beyond its useful life. Non-uniformity also resulted in
   difficulties stocking spare parts and a lack of maintenance expertise.
   Under the conventional unit procurement system, the NOAA Diving Program
   lacked a uniform training program and the safety of the diver was
   seriously compromised.

   In 1986, the NOAA Diving Safety Board (NDSB) discussed the feasibility
   of standardizing NOAA diving equipment. A survey followed to obtain
   information on the type and condition of equipment currently in use.
   The NDP then compiled a list of safe, efficient and commercially
   available diving equipment from the results of NOAA and US Navy tests.
   In 1988, survey evaluations concluded that enhanced safety and cost
   savings could be derived from centralized procurement of diving
   equipment. The first assessment for centralized procurement and repair
   of diving equipment was implemented to build a NOAA Diving Standardized
   Equipment Program in 1989.

   In January 1990, the Standardized Equipment Program (SEP) began issuing
   equipment from the NOAA Diving Center (NDC) in Seattle, WA, to all
   authorized and certified NOAA divers. NDC's procurement, maintenance
   and distribution of approved equipment ensures NOAA divers are safely
   and adequately equipped while in an active diving status.

   Program Basics

   When a NOAA employee is certified and/or placed on active dive status
   to conduct working dives as a NOAA diver, they must be enrolled by
   their Unit Diving Supervisor (UDS) in the Standardized Diving Equipment
   Program (NAO 209-123). Following receipt of a SEP Order Form, the diver
   will be issued gear for which they are accountable. All maintenance and
   repair will be done or coordinated by the NDC. When a diver is no
   longer on active status, he/she must return issued equipment through
   their UDS to the NDC.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Ordering

   To receive equipment the SEP Transaction Form must be completed and
   submitted through the divers UDS to the NOAA Diving Center. The
   signature of the UDS or the authorizing official responsible for
   enrolling unit divers in the equipment program is required on the
   equipment order form. (Note: Omitted information delays order filling.)
   Equipment will be shipped by the most efficient method. Overnight and
   express shipping charges will be deducted from the requesting units
   budget. Equipment is to be thoroughly inspected upon receipt to ensure
   proper fit. The enclosed checkout receipt is to be signed and returned
   to NDC.

   Unit Diving Supervisor (UDS) Responsibilities

   Equipment issued to shore based diving units is tracked by the onsite
   Unit Diving Supervisor (UDS). Equipment on board sea-going diving units
   is to be tracked by the shipboard Divemaster. The Divemaster, in
   conjunction with the UDS, will coordinate inventory records and annual
   equipment maintenance requirements. It is the responsibility of the UDS
   to coordinate and maintain records of equipment requests, maintenance,
   repair, and return through NDC. When a diver is transferred, placed on
   inactive status, or terminated from a unit, it is required that all the
   equipment issued to the diver be returned immediately to the NDC
   through their UDS or vessel Divemaster. Equipment shall be received by
   the NDC prior to the permanent change of station move, completion of
   assignment and termination of diving status or employment. Charges will
   continue to accrue for equipment not returned. Use of standardized
   diving equipment for proficiency dives is authorized. The use of SEP
   equipment by inactive divers is prohibited.

   Training Class Equipment Issue

   When a NOAA employee participates in NOAA Diver Training Programs, they
   will be outfitted with SEP dive equipment. Each diver candidate is
   required to submit a Diver Measurement Request Form with initial
   enrollment information. Once the diver is certified and placed on
   active dive status to conduct working dives, they will be issued gear
   for which they are accountable.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Maintenance & Repair Procedures

   All equipment is tested and inspected before issue to ensure that it is
   within safety specifications. Equipment is either repaired at the NDC,
   or contracted out to qualified vendors. NOTE: All equipment returned
   from the field for maintenance or repair is to be tagged with the
   divers name and a description of the condition of the equipment. The
   NDC controls the final decision on repair or discard of worn equipment.
   The return of equipment should be coordinated with the NDC Equipment
   Program Coordinator prior to shipping.

   All regulators, instrumentation console, depth and pressure gauges
   require annual overhaul and/or testing. Maintenance of SEP SCUBAPRO
   regulators is handled by factory certified technicians at the NDC. When
   a regulator and console are due for annual overhaul, divers will be
   issued replacement equipment for those items so that no lapse in
   operational capabilities occurs. Upon receipt of annual replacement
   equipment, the units requiring maintenance are to be returned to the
   NDC immediately. All items that are not reparable, or fail annual
   testing are either returned for warranty replacement or destroyed. NDC
   technicians make the decision to repair or dispose of any and all
   equipment sent to NDC for maintenance or repair. Divers will be advised
   of factory equipment recalls by NOAA Diving Safety Bulletins. Spare
   parts for simple repairs will be supplied through the UDS for field
   repairs.

   Mailing Procedures

   In order to identify equipment shipments, an inventory list should
   accompany all equipment returned to NDC. Equipment is to be shipped in
   rigid cushioned boxes in order to prevent damage or loss, and secured
   with strong tape designed for shipping . All divers are requested to
   provide their current return mailing address, zip code (9 digit if
   available) and phone number in all correspondence.

   Existing/Personal Equipment

   Existing equipment may stay in a unit for the rest of its useful life.
   This equipment may include dry suits, fins, knives and other accessory
   equipment. The NDC will repair existing equipment if it is equivalent
   to the Standardized Diving Equipment. The existing equipment will
   remain the property of the unit and not be included in the SEP
   inventory. Personally owned equipment may be authorized by the UDS for
   on the job use. However, maintenance, repair, or replacement will not
   be authorized under the SEP program.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Accountability

   Some deterioration and loss is to be expected. A survey of loss or
   damage will be conducted by the UDS and reported to the NDC on Standard
   Form CD-52. The NDC Property Review Board will investigate the
   circumstances surrounding the loss, theft, damage, or destruction of
   the equipment and determine any employee liability. The procedures for
   property review are set forth in NDM 37-16. Divers that lose or damage
   equipment in the interest of safety will not incur responsibility.
   Divers found negligent in the loss or damage of gear may be held
   accountable, at a cost up to the replacement cost. Chapter 5 of the
   Government Accounting Office Law Manual sets forth satisfactory
   recovery procedures. Expendable items will not be tracked and divers
   will not be held accountable (ie. fin straps, fin keepers, knife
   straps, silicone, etc).

   CD-52 Instructions

   In the case of lost or damages SEP diving equipment, form CD-52 must be
   filled out and returned to the NOAA Diving Center. The following
   documents the procedure for completing and submitting form CD-52:

   Step 1: The diver will fill out the front side of CD-52 and sign on
   bottom as the property custodian.

   Step 2: The UDS or commanding officer must complete and sign the
   recommendation section.

   Step 3: Return form CD-52 to SEP coordinator, with damaged equipment if
   applicable.

   Step 4: Findings and recommendations of Board of Review will be
   completed by the SEP Coordinator and two others.

   Step 5: Upon administrative approval from the DNDP, action will be
   completed.

   Funding/Assessment

   Operating funds are derived from present Line Office (OMAO, OAR, NMFS,
   NWS, NOS) budgets based on the average annual equipment cost per diver.
   All funds are combined under the SEP operating fund and maintained
   separately from the NDC operating funds. The annual assessment (SEP
   fee, tax, etc.) varies based on the annual operating costs required to
   ensure continued program support. Annual per diver assessment is based
   on: (current cost of standard equipment issue + average annual
   maintenance + repair cost + losses + shipping costs) divided by five
   years of anticipated useful life.

   The system of assessing in "arrears" allows a unit to add or remove
   divers to meet programs goals, and facilitates one time annual
   accounting. The unit assessment charge is based upon the total number
   of active (working) divers that made working dives, or held issued
   equipment during the prior year (i.e., FY99 assessments are based on
   FY98 diving activity).

   For divers that are: 1) removed from active status, 2) terminate
   employment, or 3) transfer between line offices or units during the
   fiscal year, the assessment will be divided by half-year activity in
   order to breakdown the fiscal year assessment for the respective units.

   A unit will also be assessed for an inactive diver that fails to
   promptly return equipment issued to them. It is the responsibility of
   the UDS and or the vessel Divemaster to coordinate the return of
   equipment issued to an inactive or terminated diver. Additional unit
   assessment may be required within the start-up year if an excessive
   number of divers are activated.

   Equipment Program Variables
     * Newly certified divers - turnover and expansion are estimated.
     * The average life of all SCUBA equipment was initially set at five
       years. Active life is reassessed as the average life history data
       is determined to be otherwise. The assessment is adjusted
       accordingly.
     * Average annual equipment loss and disposal, shipping, consumable
       and maintenance cost all increase with the growth of the program.
     * The average cost of a full gear bag will vary with economy and
       technology.
