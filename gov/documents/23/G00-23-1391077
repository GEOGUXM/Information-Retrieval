   Is there a limit on the amount of time my child can remain enrolled?

      Your child can stay on the program as long as he or she qualifies.
      Although there is no limit on the amount of time your child can remain
      on the program, you will need to renew their coverage periodically,
      generally every 6 to 12 months. As long as your children continue to
      meet the eligibility criteria established by your state, they can
      remain on the program.

   What services does the insurance cover?

      For little or no cost, this insurance pays for doctor visits,
      prescription medicines, hospitalizations, and much more. Most states
      also cover the cost of dental care, eye care, and medical equipment.

      Return to top of page

   Is this program new?

      In 1997 Congress passed legislation that allows states to provide
      health insurance to more children in working families. These programs
      build on the Medicaid program that started covering children and adults
      in the mid-1960's.

      Return to top of page

   Is this a welfare program?

      Children's health insurance programs are not welfare programs. Everyone
      has a stake in making sure America's children are healthy. These
      programs are designed to support working families and low-income
      families alike in providing health insurance to their children.

   I'm not applying for this program, but I'd like to get involved. How can I
   help?

                                        WHY

   Why is health insurance for children and teens important?

      Children who have health insurance generally have better health
      throughout their childhood and into their teens. They are more likely
      to:
        * Receive needed shots that prevent disease;
        * Get treatment for recurring illnesses such as ear infections and
          asthma;
        * Get preventative care to keep them well;
        * Get sick less often; and
        * Get the treatment they need when they are sick.

   How does having health insurance affect my child's ability to learn?

      Children who have health insurance have a better chance of being
      healthy. Having health insurance will allow you to give them the
      medical care necessary for them to stay healthy and focus on their
      studies. Children with health insurance are less likely to miss school
      because they are sick. By helping them go to school every day ready to
      learn, you can help boost your child's performance in school today and
      in the future.

      Return to top of page

   How will having insurance help my child stay healthy?

      You'll be able to pick a doctor for your child and see that doctor
      every time your child gets sick, without having to worry about how you
      are going to pay for it. Your child can get immunizations and
      well-child visits required to attend school and play sports. If your
      child gets sick, you can get prescription medicines to help him or her
      get better fast. Finally, you won't have to sit for hours in the
      emergency room when your child has an illness that could be easily
      treated in your doctor's office.

                                     HOW MUCH

   How much does it cost?

   Who pays for these health insurance programs?

      to pay a premium or co-payment for your children's health insurance.

   don't want to enroll them in Medicaid? Can I qualify for another insurance
   program?

      developed state program. Medicaid provides comprehensive health
      benefits for children. If you think your child may qualify for
      Medicaid, please call the toll-free hotline 1-877-KIDS NOW to discuss
