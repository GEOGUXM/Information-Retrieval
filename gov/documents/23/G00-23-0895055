   Emergency Watershed Program

        The Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program helps protect
   lives and property threatened by natural disasters such as floods,
   hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires. The program is administered by
   the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which
   provides technical and financial assistance to protect life and
   property threatened by a natural disaster.

   Traditional Types of Assistance
        EWP provides funding to project sponsors for such work as clearing
   debris from clogged waterways, restoring vegetation, and stabilizing
   stream channels.
        The measures taken must be environmentally and economically sound
   and generally benefit more than one property owner.
        NRCS provides up to 75 percent of the funds needed to restore the
   natural function of a watershed. The community or local sponsor of the
   work pays the remaining 25 percent, which can be provided by cash or
   in-kind services.

   New Floodplain Easement Option
        A new option on agricultural land, authorized in the 1996 Farm
   Bill, gives producers the opportunity to offer their land for a
   perpetual floodplain easement.
        The easements provide permanent restoration of the natural
   floodplain hydrology as an alternative to traditional attempts to
   restore damaged levees, lands, and structures. The easement lands would
   be ineligible for future Federal disaster assistance.

   Eligibility
        Owners, managers, and users of public, private, or tribal lands
   are eligible for EWP assistance if their watershed area has been
   damaged by a natural disaster.

   Sponsors
        Each EWP project, with the exception of floodplain easements,
   requires a sponsor who applies for the assistance. A sponsor can be any
   legal subdivision of State or local government, including local
   officials of city, county, or State governments, Indian tribes and soil
   conservation districts. They determine priorities for emergency
   assistance while coordinating work with other Federal and local
   agencies. Sponsors are needed to provide legal authority to obtain
   necessary permits, contribute funds or in-kind services, and maintain
   the completed emergency measures.

                          EWP Questions and Answers

   What is the Emergency Watershed Protection Program?
   The Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP) helps communities
   recover from environmental damage to streams and other natural
   resources, caused by natural disasters. It is designed to relieve
   imminent hazards to life and property caused by hurricanes, floods,
   fires, windstorms, and other natural occurrences. EWP generally helps
   groups of people facing a common hazard, but may in some circumstances
   be used to aid individuals. All projects undertaken must be sponsored
   by a political subdivision of the State, such as a city, county,
   general improvement district, or conservation district. The United
   States Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation
   Service (NRCS) is responsible for administering the program.

   Is financial assistance available?
   NRCS may bear up to 75 percent of the construction cost of emergency
   measures. The remaining 25 percent must come from local sources and can
   be in the form of cash or in-kind services.

   What are the criteria for assistance?
   All EWP work must reduce threats to life and property. Furthermore, it
   must be economically and environmentally defensible and sound from an
   engineering standpoint. All work must represent the least expensive
   alternative.

   Who is eligible?
   Public and private landowners are eligible for assistance but must be
   represented by a project sponsor. The project sponsor must be a public
   agency of state, county, or city government, or a special district.

   What does the sponsor have to do?
   Sponsors are responsible for providing land rights to perform emergency
   measures and securing the necessary permits. Sponsors are also
   responsible for furnishing the local cost share, for accomplishing the
   installation of work and operating and maintaining the measure. The
   work can be done either through federal or local contracts.

   What kind of work can be done?
   EWP work is not limited to any one set of prescribed measures. A case
   by case investigation of the needed work is made by NRCS. EWP work can
   include: removing debris from stream channels; stabilizing road
   culverts and bridges; reshaping and protecting eroded banks; correcting
   damaged drainage facilities; stabilizing levees and structures;
   revegetating damaged areas; and purchasing floodplain easements on
   lands subject frequent flooding.

   How do I get assistance?
   If your area has suffered severe damage and you think it may qualify
   under the EWP program, you are encouraged to contact your local
   conservation district or NRCS office to request assistance. City and
   county governments, general improvement districts, and conservation
   districts are the most common sponsors of EWP projects. The sponsor’s
   application should be in the form of a letter signed by an official of
   the sponsoring organization. The letter should include information on
   the nature, location, and scope of the problem for which assistance is
   requested.
