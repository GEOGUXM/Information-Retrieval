                        Earthquake Notification Services

   Three mailing lists are available that provide earthquake information
   rapidly on a subscription basis.
   Use this page to subscribe and unsubscribe to any or all of these
   mailing lists.

   (*)     BIGQUAKE
   Sends a message whenever an earthquake is reviewed by the duty
   geophysicist that has a magnitude of 5.5 or greater anywhere in the
   world or a magnitude of 4.5 or greater within the 50 US states,
   excluding the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. The speed of review is
   somewhat variable, but in most cases a magnitude 6.5 or greater event
   anywhere in the world or a magnitude 4.5 or greater event within the
   contiguous US is reviewed within a few hours of its occurrence. Other
   events meeting the bigquake criteria are reviewed within one or two
   days.
   The subject line of each bigquake message contains key earthquake
   parameters so that pagers and cell phones may be used to receive these
   messages.

   ( )     QEDPOST
   Sends a daily message of the earthquakes located 7 days behind the
   current day taken from our Quick Epicenter Determinations (QED)
   listing. It is a preliminary publication and typically contains 10-30
   events per day.

   ( )     MTALL
   Sends a message that contains the estimate of the seismic moment tensor
   for earthquakes with either a body-wave magnitude (mb) or surface-wave
   magnitude (MS) of 5.5 or greater.
