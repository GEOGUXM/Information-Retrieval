MESC Staff to Move to Natural Resources Research Center

   Staff of the U.S. Geological Survey's Midcontinent Ecological Science
   Center will be moving to the Natural Resources Research Center (NRRC)
   campus in the summer of 2002. The headquarters will be a three-story
   74,000 square-foot building containing office and laboratory space for
   170 people. Scientific laboratories will provide for biological (soils,
   plants, water) analyses, studies of animal ecology, and metabolic
   growth chambers. Adjacent to the headquarters building will be a 26,000
   square-foot fabrication and light industrial shop, being built jointly
   with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research
   Service.

   A groundbreaking ceremony for the two USGS buildings was held on June
   20, 2001; the buildings are scheduled for completion by July 2002
   (click here for more information on the construction schedule). Acquest
   Development Company is the owner and developer of the buildings, which
   comprise the third phase of construction on the NRRC campus.

   The NRRC is a unique campus being developed in Fort Collins, Colorado
   to support and enhance research on natural resources issues and
   represents a partnership of six federal agencies from the Department of
   Agriculture and the Department of the Interior, the U.S. General
   Services Administration, and Colorado State University. The NRRC will
   house research and support functions of the six federal agencies on a
   30-acre campus-like site leased from Colorado State University and
   managed by the U.S. General Services Administration. The campus is
   scheduled for completion in 2004 and when finished, will consist of
   five buildings and house more than 1,200 professionals.

   The NRRC effort is unparalleled in that for the first time numerous
   agencies have collaborated to consolidate and share work space,
   resources, and staff. This collocation will enhance service to
   customers; speed dissemination of useful natural resource-related
   information within the government and to other researchers, students,
   and taxpayers; minimize overlap of research activities and maximize
   joint research opportunities; improve technology transfer; enhance
   collaboration with the university's academic community; and streamline
   support services.

   For More Information: For more information on the USGS collocation to
   the Natural Resources Research Center campus, please contact Dr. Duane
   Asherin, 970-226-9402 or duane_asherin@usgs.gov.
