Determination of Non-VA Cost

     Cost-effectiveness analysis requires information on all health care
     utilization, including utilization obtained from non-VA providers.
     Data on the cost of this care may be obtained from non-VA databases,
     VA databases on contract care, or directly from the patient.  The
     analyst must take care not to double-count non-VA care reported in
     the different sources.

     Obtaining non-VA care from databases.  When veterans use non-VA
     health services, much of this can be obtained from existing
     databases.  Sources of data include Medicare and Medicaid
     utilization data, and state discharge data sets for certain states.
     Most easily available are public release files, which do not include
     patient identifiers.  In order to protect patient confidentiality,
     the agencies that control these data have established a rigorous
     process to release any patient identifiers.

     For example, in order to obtain patient identifiers associated with
     Medicare utilization data, the analyst must seek permission from the
     Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA).  HCFA must receive a
     signed data user agreement, and approve the research protocol.  It
     will then create a finder file that allows specific patients to be
     identified in the Medicare databases.  There is a charge for
     creation of this file.

     Care Paid for by VA.  VA patients receive care from non-VA providers
     that may be documented in the VA fee basis files.  The fee basis
     files include a set of financial files that provide information on
     the cost of inpatient and outpatient provided to VA patients by
     contract providers.  Please note that these files may be
     incomplete.  The VA discharge files, the Patient Treatment Files,
     includes a file that reports information on non-VA stays under
     contract to VA.  This file includes the standard fields from the PTF
     dataset, including the encoded patient identifier (i.e., scrambled
     social security number), discharge date, length of stay, and
     Diagnosis Related Group.

     Patient Interview.  Information on non-VA services use may be
     obtained directly from the patient.  The patient interviews may be
     used merely to identify non-VA providers; the analyst may then seek
     billing data from the provider.  A more complete survey may be used
     to learn the quantity of and type of care received; this may be the
     only practical approach of finding the cost of outpatient care when
     many providers are involved.

     Cost-adjusted charges.   Analysts in the non-VA sector ordinarily
     estimate the cost of hospital stays from cost-adjusted charges.
     Charges are obtained from the hospital bill, or from a discharge
     data set.  Since charges are frequently higher than actual costs,
     they need to be adjusted to reflect the actual amount of resources
     used.  This can be done by multiplying reported charges by a
     cost-to-charge ratio.

      A hospital specific cost-to-charge ratio can be calculated from
     Medicare hospital cost reports.  The hospitals total costs are
     divided by its total charges.  The cost-to-charge ratio is
     ordinarily a number between 0.5 and 1.0.
