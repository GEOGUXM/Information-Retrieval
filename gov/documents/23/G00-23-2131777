   The California Career & Training Information System (CaCTIS) is a
   product of the California Employment Development Department (EDD).
   Information contained therein has been made available under the
   following conditions:

    1. The information published on the CaCTIS site is provided without
       charge as a convenience to visitors, to be used for informational
       purposes only. While the EDD believes the information to be
       reliable, occasional human or mechanical error may occur.
       Therefore, the EDD cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness,
       timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information. The EDD
       reserves the right to make changes and corrections at any time,
       without notice.
    2. When available, links to the websites of schools and training
       institutions are provided as a courtesy to CaCTIS users. Such links
       are not intended to nor do they constitute an endorsement,
       recommendation, or favoring by the EDD of the services of that
       training provider. Our intent is to provide a convenient path to
       relevant information. The user is cautioned to contact the training
       institution directly to investigate the suitability of their
       training programs. The EDD does not review all of these sites and
       is not responsible for their content.
    3. Anyone using the information in CaCTIS does so at their own risk.
       Before making decisions based upon information in CaCTIS, visitors
       are encouraged to verify the information independently. The EDD
       shall not be responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the
       use of or results obtained from the use of this information.
