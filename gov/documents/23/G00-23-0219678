Participating in the
SHAred RESources (SHARES) HF Radio Program

   Shares Home Page

   The Shared Resources (SHARES) HF Radio Program is managed by the
   National Communications System (NCS).

                                 OBJECTIVES

     Provide participating agencies with extended high frequency coverage
   and enhance emergency high frequency radio communications at no added
   cost.

     Provide an enduring backup to vulnerable leased telecommunications.

     Provide the flagword SHARES to expedite identification and processing
   of emergency Federal government traffic.

     Standardize message preparation and procedures to simplify
   interagency handling of NS/EP traffic.

     Provide possible work-around to jamming by permitting interagency
   operation on allocated frequencies identified for SHARES use.

                            CONCEPT OF OPERATION

   The only resource under the direct control of SHARES is one station,
   KGD34, located at NCS headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.
   Participating agencies have, however, agreed to accept and pass, to the
   extent that it does not interfere with the mission responsibilities of
   the agency, emergency messages of other Federal agencies. With the
   combined resources of the participating agencies, SHARES has a virtual
   nationwide network of over one thousand stations.

                          ACTIVATION'S & EXERCISES

   In addition to activation's for real-world emergency situations, SHARES
   conducts three nationwide exercises annually in April, August and
   December. At least one of these exercises involves operation on a
   weekend. SHARES also conducts weekly check ins each Wednesday from 1600
   to 1800Z. In addition to KGD34, SHARES exercises always include one or
   more alternate net control stations or SHARES Coordination Stations
   (SCS). These stations are located throughout the U.S. and provide a
   better opportunity for low power stations to check in.

                      CIVIL AIR PATROL'S PARTICIPATION

   As the Auxiliary of the United States Air Force, CAP is eligible to
   participate in the SHARES program. That participation is currently
   managed by an Air Force Reservist, CMSgt Paul Reid, assigned to HQ
   CAP-USAF (additional duty assignment). Because the SHARES program has
   limited funding and every station costs to belong, every effort is made
   to ensure that CAP stations are an active asset rather than a drain on
   resources.
