Post-Doctoral Research Position - Posted 10 December 2001

     The Los Alamos National Laboratory, Group T-14, Detonation Theory
     and Application Group, is seeking candidates for a post-doctoral
     position to conduct research on the microscale response, and average
     properties of, materials with complex microstructure. Materials of
     interest include both metals and polymeric composites. Research
     goals include realistic numerical simulation of material response at
     the microscale, and determination of appropriate bulk composite
     properties. The position is partially funded under the Accelerated
     Strategic Computing Initiative, which emphasizes the use of large
     scale (parallel) computing for scientific study. Applicants should
     have a strong background in micromechanics and bulk property
     determination, including analytical averaging methods and bounding
     techniques. Additionally, computational solid mechanics experience
     is highly desirable, including experience with numerical
     discretization techniques and parallel computation. Familiarity with
     any of the following areas a plus: molecular dynamics mechanical
     property determination techniques, the material point method,
     computational inelasticity and constitutive modeling, modeling of
     contact and interfaces, and object-oriented C++ programming.

     Successful candidates are expected to participate in
     multidisciplinary research activities, interact with national
     laboratory and outside university personnel, and perform various
     scholarly activities. The appointment is for 3 years. Salary, with
     full benefits, will be in the range of 50 to 60K depending upon
     experience. Interested individuals should send a curriculum vita and
     cover letter, copies of selected publications and the name, address
     and phone number of at least two references to:

     T-14 group members are always interested in identifying exceptional
     candidates who may qualify for Laboratory-sponsored funding. Consult
     the web pages described above for more information about the
     postdoctoral program in gerneral, and contact group members directly
     to inquire about current specific prospects. There is a generic
     posting related to postdoc opportunities in the Theoretical
     Division, which may be of interest.
