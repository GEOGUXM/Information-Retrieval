   Mission Status


   Currently MAPping the Cosmos!

   Three quarters of the sky is scanned once, as of Jan. 1, 2002

      MAP launched at 15:46:46 EDT on June 30, 2001 aboard a Delta II-7425-10
      launch vehicle. On October 1, 2001, following a three month journey
      along the path shown at right, MAP arrived safely at its permanent
      observing station near the L2 Lagrange Point - 1.5 million km from
      Earth, a quasi-stable position a million miles from Earth in the
      direction opposite the Sun. MAP is the first mission to use an L2 orbit
      as its permanent observing station.
      While at L2, MAP will continuously scan the sky while it follows the
      Earth in its orbit around the Sun. MAP requires six months of observing
   at L2 - half of an orbit around the Sun - to observe the full sky. As
   of January 1, 2002, MAP has been at L2 for three months and has reached
   the half-way point in its collection of the first full-sky data. All
   systems continue to function very well at this point in the mission.
   MAP will collect the information needed to make a map of the entire sky
   in the microwave light left over from the Big Bang. The whole Universe
   is bathed in this afterglow light. This is the oldest light in the
   Universe and has been traveling across the Universe for 14 billion
   years. The patterns in this light across the sky encode a wealth of
   details about the history, shape, content, and ultimate fate of the
   Universe.
   Several animations of the trip to L2 may be found on our media
   resources page.
