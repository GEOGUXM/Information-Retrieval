Pseudopotential Calculations of the Electronic Structure of Semiconductor
Quantum Nanostructures

   The Solid State Theory group is involved in performing state of the art
   calculations of the electronic structure of a wide range of
   semiconductor nanostructures, ranging from 2 dimensional quantum wells
   and superlattices to 0 dimensional quantum dots.

   Our theory of quantum nanostructures proceeds in the following steps:
    1. Assume the size, shape and composition of the nanostructure. The
       nanostructures can be "free-standing" colloidal dots whose surface
       is passivated, or "embedded dots" such as pyramidal or lens-shaped
       InAs in a GaAs "cap". One can assume also that the dot is either
       chemically pure, or that it has a given composition/alloying
       profile.
    2. Relax the atomic positions to minimize strain. If the dot is
       embedded in another material, we use the Valence Force Field (VFF)
       to relax all atomic positions.
    3. Construct empirical psuedopotentials. Since we need to avoid "LDA
       errors", we must use "realistic" pseudopotentials that not only
       produce correct band gaps, but also give (unlike LDA) correct
       effective masses and their anisotropies. Furthermore, since we need
       to consider very large dots, we need pseudopotentials whose plane
       wave description can be accomodated with a small basis set (e.g. a
       cut-off of 5 Ry). We have developed a new generation of empirical
       pseudopotential methods which satisfy these conditions.
    4. Solve the single particle Schroedinger equation using one of the
       folowing methods.
          + The Folded Spectrum Method (FSM)
          + The Linear Combination of Bulk Bands (LCBB)
    5. Calculate the dielectric screening function and the interparticle
       Coulomb and exchange integrals.
    6. Using the single-particle levals and inter-particle interactions,
       solve the configuration-interactions problem.
