  Title 19

  The Office of the State Fire Marshal (SFM) Code Development and
  Analysis Program staff regularly reviews Title 19  California Code of
  Regulations for relevancy, necessity, conflict, duplication, and
  overlap. They also implement legislative mandates to develop
  regulations relating to fire and life safety involving the various
  occupancy classifications under the authority of the California State
  Fire Marshal. This encompasses the actual administrative processing of
  regulations from concept to promulgation in the California Code of
  Regulations.

  Regulations are processed in accordance with the Administrative
  Procedures Act (APA). This Act promotes public participation in the
  development of regulations. The Code Development and Analysis Program
  staff work in conjunction with the State Office of Administrative Law.
  They also coordinate regulatory development activities with fire
  service organizations, State Fire Marshal advisory committees, and
  numerous professional and advocacy organizations.
