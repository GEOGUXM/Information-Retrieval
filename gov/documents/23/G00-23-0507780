   Draft Circular A-16 Transmitted to OMB

   The Secretary of the Interior, Gale A. Norton, has sent a letter to the
   Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on behalf of the Federal
   Geographic Data Committee suggesting OMB Circular A-16 be revised.
   Included in the transmittal is a draft version of Circular A-16 for
   OMB's consideration

   The suggestion to review and revise Circular A-16 is an outcome of
   several activities. In May 2000, after an extensive study of FGDC
   members and stakeholders, the FGDC issued a report entitled "Improving
   Federal Agency Geospatial Data Coordination." A key recommendation of
   this report is the revision of OMB Circular A-16. In July 2000, OMB, in
   cooperation with FGDC, held a public roundtable addressing barriers
   that prevent the shared use of geospatial information among Federal,
   State, local and Tribal government agencies, and the private sector.
   This meeting clarified the need for improvements in geospatial data
   coordination. Thus, Circular A-16, as the basis of the Nation's
   geospatial data coordination, is in need of revision. New opportunities
   to incorporate geospatial data into government services, like e-gov,
   suggest that the revision of Circular A-16 is timely.
