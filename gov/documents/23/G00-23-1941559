   7/13/01: Solved -- The case of the missing neutrinos: Ever wonder where
     all those neutrinos have gone to well P-23's Weak Interactions has
                                 found out.

                              Mission Statment

   The Neutron Science and Technology Group (P-23) of the Physics division
        at Los Alamos National Laboratory conduct a broad program of
    fundamental and applied research in physics. We carry out nationally
   and internationally recognized programs in nuclear physics, high-energy
     astrophysics, quantum information science, and weapons physics. The
        commonality uniting these divers effort in the application of
    state-of-the-art techniques in particle and photon detection and the
    use of neutrons and proton as sophisticated probes of the fundamental
                            properties of matter.
