                REGENTS CHANCELLOR HAYDEN, COMMISSIONER MILLS
           PRAISE "QUIET HEROISM" OF TEACHERS AND SCHOOL LEADERS,
                    PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON SAFETY PLANNING,
                        TEACHING RESPECT, COUNSELING

   Regents Chancellor Carl T. Hayden and State Education Commissioner
   Richard Mills today praised the "quiet heroism" of teachers and school
   leaders in the face of the September 11 attack on New York and its
   aftermath.

   They also issued guidance on school safety planning for terrorism,
   respect for differences, and crisis counseling in response to requests
   from schools across the State.

   "There are many people working in the schools who are heroes,"
   Chancellor Hayden said. "Some saved lives, leading their school
   children up Manhattan to safety. Some rode buses to churches, to other
   schools, to homes, and did not leave until the children were returned
   safely to their parents or loved ones."

   "The children, their families and everyone else needed stability on the
   first day and the days that came after," Commissioner Mills said. "They
   needed calm adults around them. Local schools, colleges, libraries,
   VESID, and museums provided what they needed. They did it by staying
   open. To all of them, we need to say a public thank you."

   The State’s two top education officials said many schools had asked for
   advice about updating safety plans, ensuring greater respect for Arab
   American and Muslim students, and for crisis counseling. "We have
   talked with literally hundreds of school people who are already
   planning for the next crisis or facing up to issues of discrimination
   or working with children who are troubled," they said. "They continue
   to be heroes today."

   In response to the requests, they issued three documents with brief
   guidance and a list of additional resources that schools can access.

   "Schools are already updating their safety and security plans, as
   required by the SAVE legislation," Commissioner Mills said. "They know
   they need to plan for any possible future terrorism, and they have
   asked for advice. This communication gives them some suggestions and
   questions to answer and points them to some additional resources. Still
   more information will be coming soon."

   The memo advises schools to review specifics concerning the roles
   different school personnel will take, the types of communications that
   will not be disrupted, the need for sheltering students and releasing
   students, and the nature of drills and exercises that will help schools
   prepare.

   The memo on tolerance also outlines some dos and don’ts and points to
   additional resources. "The first school I visited after September 11,"
   Commissioner Mills said, "was a large Muslim school in New York City.
   Many children there were afraid to be outside, upset by hateful words
   and actions from people who released their anger by trying to create
   scapegoats. The President, the Governor and the Mayor set the right
   tone by rebuking such shameful behavior."

   The memo on crisis counseling also points to resources that can be
   helpful in working with children.
