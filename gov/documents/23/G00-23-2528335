                                 Introduction

     The annual Awards Program is one of the most important functions of
     the Interagency OPSEC Support Staff (IOSS). As the focal point for
   OPSEC in the United States Government, the IOSS is constantly striving
   to improve the awards process. Our goal is to ensure that the national
      security community recognizes those who go the extra mile in the
                      promotion of Operations Security.

                                   Process

     The IOSS has created a process with a minimal level of bureaucracy
    which allows more OPSEC professionals to be recognized for their hard
                            work and dedication.

       Any government employee or supporting contractor may forward an
       unlimited number of submissions with the approval of the senior
        official of their organization (i.e., Director, Chairman, or
        Secretary). Help us recognize the best in your organization.
