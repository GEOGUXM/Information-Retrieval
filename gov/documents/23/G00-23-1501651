   Plan Administration

   PBGC insures nearly 38,000 private defined benefit pension plans
   covering more than 43 million American workers and retirees. Under
   PBGC's pension insurance programs, the administrators of these plans,
   and the companies that sponsor the plans, have a number of reporting
   and administrative responsibilities (such as paying annual pension
   insurance premiums and reporting significant events affecting their
   plans).

   See the menu in the upper right corner of this page (yellow box) for
   more information on these responsibilities and other topics of
   interest.
