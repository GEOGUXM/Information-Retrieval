   AFDC navigation
   Alternative fuels are being used today in place of gasoline and diesel
   fuel made from petroleum. The U.S. Department of Energy classifies the
   following fuels as "alternative fuels": biodiesel, electricity,
   ethanol, hydrogen, methanol, natural gas, propane, p-series, and solar
   energy. Using these alternative fuels can help our nation reduce its
   dependence on imported petroleum and improve air quality. In this
   section, you will find a variety of information on these fuels, as well
   as links to other resources with more detailed information.
