     The universe is populated by billions of galaxies. Many of those
     galaxies assemble in giant groups formed by invisible dark matter
     and hot gas. Most contain giant black holes in their center that can
     become quasars by capturing and igniting surrounding gas.

     Under NASA direction, Space VLBI outreach seeks to bring the latest
     scientific findings into a classroom setting.
