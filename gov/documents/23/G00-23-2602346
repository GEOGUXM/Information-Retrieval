   Federal Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Laws
   What are the Federal Laws Prohibiting Job Discrimination?
     * Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits
       employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or
       national origin;
     * the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA), which protects men and women who
       perform substantially equal work in the same establishment from
       sex-based wage discrimination;
     * the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), which
       protects individuals who are 40 years of age or older;
     * Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which
       prohibits employment discrimination against qualified individuals
       with disabilities who work in the federal government; and
     * Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits
       discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities who
       work in the federal government; and
     * the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which provides monetary damages in
       cases of intentional employment discrimination.
       The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces all of
       these laws. EEOC also provides oversight and coordination of all
       federal equal employment opportunity regulations, practices, and
       policies.
