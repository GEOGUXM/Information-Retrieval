                              BRD Headquarters

     The headquarters of the Biological Resources Discipline (BRD) is
     located in Reston, Virginia, and consists of the offices of the
     Associate Director for Biology, the Chief Scientist for Biology, the
     Associate Chief Biologist for Information and the Chief of
     Cooperative Research Units.

     Here's a brief look at each of their offices.

     The Associate Director for Biology is responsible for planning and
     oversight of the science program and associated activities.

     The Chief Scientist for Biology is responsible for BRD science
     program planning, budget development, policy, and program
     evaluation.

     The Associate Chief Biologist for Information is responsible for
     establishing policies, procedures and partnerships for implementing
     biological informatics program components at local, regional and
     global scales.

     The Chief, Cooperative Research Units (CRUs) serves as the national
     program chief for work conducted by the CRUs across the United
     States. Each unit is a partnership among BRD, a host university, and
     one of several State fish and wildlife agencies working to address
     local, regional, and national biological research needs. Units also
     participate in the graduate education of future national resource
     professionals. CRUs operate to fill gaps in fish and wildlife
     management information and ensure availability of trained fish and
     wildlife biologists. CRUs also provide technical assistance and
     training to State and Federal personnel and other resource managers.
