     Harmless Virus Prevents HIV Variant From Spreading In Human Tissue
                                   Blocks

   Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), a common virus that is apparently harmless
       in adults, appears to prevent a form of the AIDS virus from
       reproducing in laboratory cultures of human tissue, according to a
       study published in the November issue of Nature Medicine.
       The study was led by Leonid Margolis, Ph.D, of the National
       Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and
       included Jean-Charles Grivel, Yoshinori Ito and Wendy Fitzgerald,
       as well as Paolo Lusso at the San Raffaele Scientific Institute in
       Milan, Italy and his coworkers.
       Specifically, HHV-6 inhibits the HIV variants that transmit
       infection and are present at its early stages. Conversely, HHV-6
       does not seem to significantly affect the HIV variants that are
       typical for the later stages of HIV infection.
       "This finding provides insight into how a harmless virus might
       affect the immune system in a way that slows the reproduction of a
       lethal virus," said Duane Alexander, M.D., director of the NICHD.
       "Future research could lead to new drugs that can better help the
       immune system to fend off HIV, and may even lead to new strategies
       for designing a vaccine against HIV."
       HHV-6 is common in the U.S. and other countries and does not appear
       to cause any disease in adults. Infants infected with HHV 6 may
       develop roseola, a mild rash that disappears within several days.
       The study's senior author, Dr. Margolis, explained that both the
       early and late stage variants of HIV bind to target cells by means
       of a "receptor complex." In a process analogous to keys fitting
       into locks, molecules on the surface of HIV bind to molecules on
       the surface of immune cells. Once the molecular "unlocking" takes
       place, the virus fuses with the cell and infects it.
       The process usually involves HIV binding to a receptor known as
       CD4. However, in order to fuse with a cell, HIV also needs to bind
       to another receptor on the cell's surface. HIV-1 variants that
       transmit infection and dominate the early stages of the infection
       bind to a molecule known as CCR5. People infected with these HIV-1
       variants may not show any outward symptoms of HIV infection for a
       long period. As disease progresses, these viruses are often
       replaced with other variants, which bind to another receptor,
       CXCR4.
       Dr. Margolis and his colleagues developed methods to maintain small
       blocks of living human tonsil tissue outside of the body and to
       infect them with HIV and HHV-6. Tonsils are part of the lymphoid
       system, the network of immune cells and molecules that police the
       body in search of disease causing organisms. They found that the
       HIV variants that use CCR5 do not reproduce as fast in tissue
       blocks that are also infected with HHV-6 as they do when maintained
       in tissues that are free of HHV 6. Conversely, the HIV-1 variants
       that use CXCR4 and are typical for the late stages of disease,
       reproduce slightly more rapidly in cultures containing HHV-6. These
       variants typically kill more immune cells than do the CCR5
       variants. The researchers also discovered the molecular mechanism
       by which HHV-6 affects HIV-1 reproduction. Tissues infected with
       HHV-6 produced large amounts of a molecule called RANTES. RANTES
       apparently blocks the CCR5 receptor-analogous to plugging up a lock
       with plumber's putty-so that HIV cannot fit its "key" into it.
       Therefore, by triggering RANTES production, HHV-6 deprives the
       early HIV variant of its binding site, which, in turn, prevents the
       HIV virus from entering the cell. As added proof of this mechanism,
       the researchers added RANTES to cultures containing only the
       CCR5-using HIV variant. As expected, the reproduction of these
       viruses was suppressed.
       Dr. Margolis noted that the conclusion from these unexpected
       results is that a harmless herpesvirus-6 may play a profound role
       in the progression from initial infection to full-blown AIDS by
       suppressing an early type HIV variant and probably creating more
       favorable conditions for variants that use CXCR4.
       Dr. Margolis added that another study he and his coworkers as well
       as Dr. Lusso's group have undertaken will seek to confirm their
       findings by analyzing samples from people infected with HIV. If so,
       researchers may try to devise strategies for manipulating HHV-6 to
       treat people infected with HIV. For example, trying to hinder or
       eliminate HHV-6 in patients with already established HIV infection
       may slow down or prevent the appearance of the CXCR4 variants that
       appear during HIV infection.
       On the other hand, it may be possible that activating HHV-6 may
       either prevent HIV infection or slow the spread of this virus at
       the early stages. "However, before such an approach could be
       developed and tested, any attempts to use HHV-6 to slow down HIV
       infection are risky and premature," Dr. Margolis said.
       Recent studies of people with HIV disease show that those infected
       with two other microorganisms may develop AIDS more slowly than do
       people not infected with either of the two other microorganisms.
       The organisms areGB virus C, a hepatitis virus, and the bacteria
       that causes scrub typhus, a potentially lethal infection occurring
       in Asia and Australia.
       However, whether these two organisms do indeed slow down the
       progression of HIV infection to AIDS or their presence reflects
       other unknown factors that lead to a favorable HIV response is not
       yet known. The work of Dr. Margolis and his colleagues is the first
       demonstration that another virus can selectively affect infection
       by various HIV variants and for the first time showed the molecular
       mechanisms that another microorganism uses to suppress the AIDS
       virus.
