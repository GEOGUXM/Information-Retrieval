         Low Birthweight and Preterm Babies Need Ongoing Evaluation

   A growing number of young children may not crawl, pick up small
   objects, speak or even smile at the age most children do.  New research
   indicates that babies born less than 5 Â½ pounds or before 37 weeks of
   pregnancy may experience delays in motor and social development
   throughout early childhood, up to age 4.

   These findings were published in a new study: Birthweight and
   Gestational Age Effects on Motor and Social Development, in the January
   issue of Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology.  The research was
   conducted by a team at the National Institute of Child Health and Human
   Development that included Dr. Mary Overpeck of HRSAs Maternal and Child
   Health Bureau.

   Researchers examined results of a health and nutrition survey taken
   from a national sample of 4,621 infants and children, ages 2 months to
   nearly 4 years old.  They looked at babies birth certificates to learn
   their birthweight and at how many weeks during pregnancy they were
   born.  A special scale assessing how well these babies progressed in
   motor and social development for their age told researchers how low
   birthweight or preterm babies measured up against those born full term
   or at normal birthweight.

   Since low birthweight and preterm delivery are associated with small
   but measurable delays in motor and social development, the researchers
   urge health care providers to consider both when evaluating development
   in young children.

   HRSAs Maternal and Child Health Bureau promotes the medical home a
   system of ongoing health care for infants and children that encourages
   partnerships between families and health care providers in making
   medical decisions and helps families find specialized care and services
   when needed.  The new study documents the need to follow LBW and
   preterm babies closely in such a system so that appropriate and early
   intervention can be provided.
