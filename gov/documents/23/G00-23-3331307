                                    Web Site

   This website runs pretty much automatically so there may be outages and
   interruptions which pass unnoticed. We try to keep abreast of its
   status, and we succeed, for the most part, but there's only one person
   monitoring it, and he does other things too.

   The "Created:" times are in Pacific Time, Daylight or Standard,
   depending. The times indicated on the various products are GMT. In the
   past, this has led to some confusion.

   The two 'Archives' which we maintain: I keep the past products until
   the 4 Gb disk gets about 95% full, then I purge the oldest products
   with a ruthless application of `find ./ -mtime XX -exec rm -f.' The
   'XX' is determined more or less at my whim, but you can usually find
   the last 2 or 3 months of products on the site. I wouldn't depend on
   much more, if I were you.

                                    The Data

   The Data come from the SeaWinds instrument aboard the QuikSCAT
   satellite. Frequently we refer to the data as Quikscat data. To be the
   most precise, we should say SeaWinds on QuikSCAT but that is such a
   mouthful! Don't be confused if you see all three phrases, Quikscat,
   SeaWinds and SeaWinds on QuikSCAT, they all mean the same thing.

   See the Scatterometry Project's Winds page here at JPL for the general
   discussion of Scatterometry, specific information about SeaWinds on
   QuikSCAT, history of past missions and news of upcoming ones. In
   particular, another SeaWinds instrument will be flying on the Adeos II
   spacecraft, built, launched and run by Japan's national space
   administration NASDA, currently projected to launch in Nov, 2001.

                                   Animations

   Fourteen hours of QuikSCAT data is interpolated to a 1x1 degree grid
   using the method of successive corrections and then animated using our
   special animator. The time indicated on the animation is the end time
   of the last file included in the animation.

                                 Cloud Overlays

   What's to say? We plot the clouds and then the winds over them.

   The time given on the plot is the GMT of the cloud data used. The wind
   data varies +/- 3 hours of this time, depending on its availability.
   The data flagged as 'rain contaminated' is plotted in black.

   The GMS 5 cloud imagery was originally obtained via GMS of JMA and made
   available to us by Nasa and the University of Hawaii.
