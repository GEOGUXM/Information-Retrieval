   waiver :
   A waiver is an exception to a TASC internal rule, permission to deviate
   from the way TASC might customarily carry out its business, or
   authorization to disregard a TASC requirement.

   Rule :
   The term "rule"  includes just about anything and everything associated
   with the way TASC carries out its business processes and provides
   products and services to TASC customers.  It includes not only TASC
   rules; it also includes TASC generated policies, procedures, systems,
   work processes, etc.,  which TASC uses and which a TASC official has
   the authority to waive, either in whole or in part; on a temporary or
   permanent basis.

   Process_Owner :
   The process owner, sometimes referred to as the "approving official,"
   is the TASC official who created or currently owns the "rule" or
   manages the process requirement(s) that you would like waived, and who
   has the authority to grant a waiver of the rule or current process
   requirements.

   Approving_Official :
   See definition above; Process Owner.

   Independent_Official :
   The independent official serves as the process owner of the TASC Waiver
   Request Process and is the only TASC official who can disapprove a
   waiver request.  The Independent Official is also responsible for
   reviewing any proposed disapproval of a waiver request and making the
   final decision on proposed disapprovals.  All decisions of the
   independent official are final.  The Principal, TASC Customer Service,
   is designated as the independent official and is responsible for
   championing the Process and for monitoring waiver requests as they are
   processed through the TASC Waiver Request Process.  The Principal, TASC
   Customer Service can be contacted by phone at (202) 366-4747.
