    Welcome to the BNL (Bera) Micro Computer Club's Cyber "Space" connect
     __________________________________________________________________

   The BERA Microcomputer club is a semi-formal gathering of real people
   here at Brookhaven National Laboratory, who enjoy getting together do
   discuss all matters computer: i.e., how to get some real power out of
   simple environments like "Visual Basic", maintaining a birthday card
   list in WordPerfect or Word, or how to clean a mouse. We are a mix of
   PC, Mac, and UNIX users and our level of knowledge ranges from novice
   to advanced (also known as a power user).

   The microcomputer club is dedicated to the proposition that someday the
   revolution will come and humans will take over from computers, and so
   we had better get ready (and have some lunch).

   More specifically, the club's objectives are:
          To promote understanding and enjoyment of computing
          To enhance computer skills of the members
          To bring useful computer information to the lab community
          To share information and techniques with members

   The current officers of the club are:
          Steve Stein, President
          Victor Gutierrez, Vice President
          Roy Thern, Treasurer
          Robert Sabatini, Secretary
