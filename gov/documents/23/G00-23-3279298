   The energy challenge facing California is real.
   California continues to experience electrical shortages and rolling
   blackouts throughout the State. To reduce the risk of power outages,
   the most important thing we can do in the short term is reduce our
   demand for electricity and use energy more efficiently.
   The Governor and leaders of the California Legislature are working with
   utility companies, generators and consumer groups to fashion long-term
   solutions for reliable and affordable electricity. The State has
   already implemented a plan to reduce consumption by a minimum of 8
   percent across the board.
   And you have an important role to play right now.
   We in California have the power of nearly 35 million people and the
   sixth
   largest economy in the world. By reducing our electricity demand, we
   can
   help avoid shortages and lower energy bills.
   All OCJP grantees and members of the criminal justice field have to do
   is
   FLEX YOUR POWER.
   What can you do? Below are some simple steps you can take right now,
   both at home and in the office, to reduce demand and cut your own
   energy costs:
     * Turn thermostats down to 68 degrees or below. Reduce settings to 55
       degrees before going to sleep or when away for the day. For each 1
       degree, you'll save up to 5% on your heating costs.
     * Turn off non-essential lights and appliances, especially in unused
       offices and conference rooms. Turn down other lighting when
       possible.
     * Turn computers, copiers and other office equipment to low-power
       standby mode when not in use. Use a laptop computer. Laptops use
       significantly less energy than desktop computers. Turn equipment
       off at the end of the workday. Unplug electronic chargers when not
       in use (e.g., cell phone chargers).
     * Minimize energy usage during the peak demand hours of 5 a.m. to 9
       a.m. and 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.
       When you are at home, you can also implement these cost-cutting and
       energy-savings measures.
     * Close shades and blinds at night to reduce the amount of heat lost
       through windows.
     * Use lower washing temperatures and line dry clothes whenever you
       can.
     * Insulate water heaters. Water heater blankets are available at your
       local hardware store.
     * Weather-strip your doors and windows. Change heating filters often.
     * Buy Energy Star appliances, products and lights.
