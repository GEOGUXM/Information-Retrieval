                               PRIVACY POLICY
     __________________________________________________________________

   Administrators of the Secretary's Mentoring System have made it a
   priority to protect the privacy of any personal information provided to
   us on this site. Your membership and patronage are important to us, and
   we recognize your concerns regarding the use of your personal
   information. To ease those concerns, we have established the following
   Privacy Policy to inform you of what information we will be collecting
   and how it will be used.

   What Information Do We Collect?

   Those of you who decide to become a mentor, and are not employees of
   the US Coast Guard, will be asked for the following information:
     * Name,
     * Position title,
     * Pay plan/series/grade,
     * Operating administration,
     * Routing symbol,
     * Phone and fax numbers;
     * E-mail address;
     * Age range; and
     * Information about your career, interests, and hobbies.

   Employees of the US Coast Guard will also be asked whether they are or
   were active military and several military service related questions.

   How Do We Use The Information You Provide?

   The information you provide will allow employees looking for mentors to
   access your data either through a word search or other criteria they
   enter onto the mentee form. For instance, if an individual is looking
   for a mentor at the GS-14 level, in Human Resources in OST, the
   individual will enter that information and receive names and data for
   all GS-14 HR Specialists in OST who are interested in becoming mentors.

   Cookies

   "Cookies" are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on
   your computer. Cookies don't contain personal information like your
   name or address, but rather only identify you as a person who is
   visiting the site. The mentoring system uses session only cookies,
   which means that the cookies are deleted once you end each browser
   session.

   Security

   The Mentoring System Database has taken measures to secure the
   information you provide on-line. These include a requirement that your
   e-mail address be used as your login name, and approval by the system
   administrator of all individuals wishing to enter. By providing this
   information, the system administrator can verify that all individuals
   accessing the Mentoring System are in fact DOT employees.
   Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed
   to be 100% secure. Therefore, the Mentoring System cannot warrant the
   security of the information transmitted. When you provide such
   information, you do so at your own risk.

   Will This Policy Ever Change?

   It is possible that this policy will change based on reviews of the
   Mentoring System, and we reserve the right to make changes. However, if
   a change is made, it will be addressed on this site. We suggest you
   check this policy regularly to stay informed of any changes so you can
   make informed decisions when providing personal information.

   Summary

   The Secretary's Mentoring System is committed to making this site a
   fulfilling, informative, and secure environment. We have taken the
   necessary steps to ensure the privacy of the information you provide to
   us. Our use of your information will only enhance your experience on
   our web site, and shall not be given or sold to others.
