                                 Air Quality

                            Downtown San Antonio

   Air quality has become one of the most important issues facing the San
   Antonio region.  The Mayor and City Council have made maintaining the
   quality of our air one of their top priorities.  San Antonio is
   currently in attainment with federal Clean Air Act standards for
   ozone.  However, based on monitoring over the last three years, San
   Antonio is very close to being designated "non-attainment" under the
   new, more stringent 8-hour standard.
   Everyone in the San Antonio area can help keep our air clean by
   thinking about how their actions affect the environment.  Some very
   simple things can be done on a daily basis to help prevent pollution.
   Below are some links that access air monitoring data and information
   related to the issue of ozone pollution.  Some useful tips are provided
   that will help you take care of our air.  In addition, the City's plan
   for pollution prevention is provided for your information.
