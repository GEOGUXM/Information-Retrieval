     The NOAA General Counsel serves as the chief legal officer for the
     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the U.S.

     The General Counsel is appointed by the Secretary of Commerce, with

     10-6.

     The Office of the NOAA General Counsel is managed by the General
     Counsel, two Deputy General Counsels, and a Managing Attorney.

     In headquarters, there are a series of primary subdivisions headed
     by Assistant General Counsels (Fisheries; Ocean Services;
     Enforcement and Litigation), and Senior Counselors (International;
     Atmospheric and Space Services and Research; Legislation and
     Compliance; Policy and Administration).

     Regional Counsels manage offices in Gloucester, MA; St. Petersburg,
     FL; Long Beach, CA; Seattle, WA and Juneau, AK. The position of
