   The information below outlines 1996 amendments to the airman medical
   standards of the Federal Aviation Regulations. The new rules are
   effective September 16, 1996. The 1996 rule change also amends the
   duration period of the third-class airman medical certificate--as of
   September 16, when an airman medical certificate is issued to an
   applicant who is under age 40, it will be good for a 3year period. For
   a full discussion of the notice of proposed rulemaking and final rule,
   see the Federal Register at 59 FR 53226 and 61 FR 11238. SUMMARY OF
   AMENDMENTS TO PART 67, MEDICAL STANDARDS AND CERTIFICATION The
   following is a summary of the substantive revisions made by this
   rulemaking. Because this rulemaking completely recodifies part 67, this
   summary states both the current and new section/paragraph numbers. 1.
   Distant visual acuity requirements for first- and second-class medical
   certification are changed to delete the uncorrected acuity standards.
   However, each eye must be corrected to 20/20 or better, as in the
   current standard. [Current Secs. 67.13(b) and 67.15(b); Final Secs.
   67.103(a) and 67.203(a)] 2. For third-class medical certification, the
   current 20/50, uncorrected, or 20/30, corrected, distant visual acuity
   standard is changed to 20/40 or better, in each eye, with or without
   correction. [Current Sec. 67.17(b); Final Sec. 67.303(a)] 3. For first-
   and second-class medical certification, minimum near visual acuity
   requirements are specified in terms of Snellen equivalent (20/40),
   corrected or uncorrected, each eye, at 16 inches. This replaces the
   current standard of v=1.00 at 18 inches for first-class only. An
   intermediate visual acuity standard (near vision at 32 inches) of 20/40
   or better at 32 inches Snellen equivalent, corrected or uncorrected, is
   added to the first- and second-class visual requirements for persons
   over age 50. [Current Secs. 67.13(b) and 67.15(b); Final Secs.
   67.103(b), 67.203(b), and 67.303(b)] 4. A near visual acuity standard
   of 20/40 or better, Snellen equivalent, at 16 inches in each eye
   separately, with or without correction is added to the third-class
   visual requirements. [Current (None); Final Sec. 67.303(b)] 5. Color
   vision requirements are amended to read: "ability to perceive those
   colors necessary for safe performance of airman duties,'' and are the
   same for all classes. Current standards require "normal color vision''
   for first-class and the ability to distinguish aviation signal colors
   for second- and third-class applicants. [Current Secs. 67.13(b),
   67.15(b), and 67.17(b); Final Secs. 67.103(c), 67.203(c), and
   67.303(c)] 6. The current first-class standard pertaining to
   pathological conditions of the eye or adnexa that interfere or that may
   reasonably be expected to interfere with proper function of an eye is
   substituted in both the second- and third-class standards for the
   current standards which specify, respectively, "no pathology of the
   eye" and "no serious pathology of the eye." [Current Secs. 67.15(b) and
   67.17(b); Final Secs. 67.203(e) and 67.303(d)] 7. The "whispered voice
   test" for hearing is replaced for all classes by a conversational voice
   test using both ears at 6 feet; an audiometric word (speech)
   discrimination test to a score of at least 70 percent obtained in one
   ear or in a sound field environment; or pure tone audiometry according
   to a table of acceptable thresholds (American National Standards
   Institute (ANSI), 1969). [Current Secs. 67.13(c), 67.15(c), and
   67.17(c); Final Secs. 67.105(a), 67.205(a), and 67.305(a)] 8. The
   standards pertaining to the ear, nose, mouth, pharynx, and larynx are
   revised to more general terms and related to flying and speech
   communication. Specific references to the mastoid and eardrum are
   deleted. The current standard, "No disturbance in equilibrium," is
   changed to, "No ear disease or condition manifested by, or that may
   reasonably be expected to be manifested by, vertigo or a disturbance of
   equilibrium." The amended standards are the same for all classes.
   [Current Secs. 67.13(c), 67.15(c), and 67.17(c); Final Secs. 67.105(b),
   67.205(b), and 67.305(b)] 9. "Psychosis," as used in the final rule,
   refers to a mental disorder in which the individual has delusions,
   hallucinations, grossly bizarre or disorganized behavior, or other
   commonly accepted symptoms of this condition, or may reasonably be
   expected to manifest such symptoms. [Current Secs. 67.13(d), 67.15(d),
   and 67.17(d); Final Secs. 67.107(a), 67.207(a), and 67.307(a)] 10.
   Substance dependence and substance abuse are defined and specified as
   disqualifying medical conditions. Substance dependence is disqualifying
   unless there is clinical evidence, satisfactory to the Federal Air
   Surgeon, of recovery, including sustained total abstinence from the
   substance for not less than the preceding 2 years. Substance abuse
   within the previous 2 years is disqualifying. It is defined as use of a
   substance in a situation in which that use is physically hazardous if
   there has been at any other time an instance of the use of a substance
   also in a situation in which that use was physically hazardous; or if a
   person has received a verified positive drug test result under an
   anti-drug program of the Department of Transportation or one of its
   administrations; or if the Federal Air Surgeon makes a finding of
   substance abuse. Alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse are included in
   the terms "substance dependence" and "substance abuse", respectively.
   [Current Secs. 67.13(d), 67.15(d), and 67.17(d); Final Secs. 67.107(a)
   and (b), 67.207(a) and (b), and 67.307(a) and (b)] 11. "Bipolar
   disorder" is added as a specifically disqualifying condition. This
   addresses an issue created by a change in nomenclature contained in the
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition
   (DSM III), and continued in the DSM IV. [Current (None); Final Secs.
   67.107(a), 67.207(a), and 67.307(a)] 12. The general mental standard is
   amended to add the word "other" before "mental." The final revised
   standard reads, "No other personality disorder, neurosis, or other
   mental condition * * *." [Current Secs. 67.13(d), 67.15(d), and
   67.17(d); Final Secs. 67.107(c), 67.207(c), and 67.307(c)] 13. ``A
   transient loss of control of nervous system function(s) without
   satisfactory medical explanation of the cause,'' is added as a
   specifically disqualifying neurologic condition. [Current (None); Final
   Secs. 67.109(a), 67.209(a), and 67.309(a)] 14. The word "seizure," is
   substituted for "convulsive." [Current Secs. 67.13(d), 67.15(d), and
   67.17(d); Final Secs. 67.109(b), 67.209(b), and 67.309(b)] 15. "Cardiac
   valve replacement," "permanent cardiac pacemaker implantation," and
   "heart replacement" are added as specifically disqualifying
   cardiovascular conditions for all classes of certification. [Current
   Secs. 67.13(e), 67.15(e), and 67.17(e); Final Secs. 67.111(a); 67.211
   (d), (e), and (f); and 67.311 (d), (e), and (f)] 16. The time period
   for which an electrocardiogram may be used to satisfy the requirements
   of the first-class medical certificate is revised to 60 days from the
   current 90 days. [Current Sec. 67.13(e); Final Secs. 67.111(c)] 17. The
   current table of age-related maximum blood pressure readings for
   applicants for first-class medical certificates and the reference to
   ``circulatory efficiency'' are deleted. Blood pressure will continue to
   be assessed for all three classes but will be evaluated under the
   appropriate general medical standards. [Current Sec. 67.13(e); Final
   Secs. 67.113(b), 67.213(b), and 67.313(b)] 18. Current Sec. 67.19,
   Special issue of medical certificates, is rewritten [Final Sec.
   67.401(a)] to provide for, at the discretion of the Federal Air
   Surgeon, an ``Authorization for a Special Issuance of Medical
   Certificate'' (Authorization), valid for a specified period of time. An
   individual who does not meet the published standards of part 67 may be
   issued a medical certificate of the appropriate class if he or she
   possesses a valid Authorization. The duration of any medical
   certificate issued in accordance with Sec. 67.401 is for the period
   specified at the time of its issuance or until withdrawal of an
   Authorization upon which the certificate is based. A new Authorization
   is required after expiration, and the applicant must again request
   Authorization. 19. Final Sec. 67.401(b) provides for a Statement of
   Demonstrated Ability (SODA) instead of an Authorization. A SODA will be
   issued without expiration date to applicants whose disqualifying
   conditions are static or nonprogressive and who have been found capable
   of performing airman duties without endangering public safety. A SODA
   authorizes an aviation medical examiner to issue a medical certificate
   if the condition is unchanged and the applicant is otherwise eligible.
   20. Final Sec. 67.401(e) retains the language of current Sec. 67.19(c)
   regarding consideration of the freedom of a private pilot to accept
   reasonable risks to his or her own person or property that are not
   acceptable in the exercise of commercial or airline transport pilot
   privileges, and consideration at the same time of the need to protect
   the safety of persons and property in other aircraft and on the ground.
   21. Final Sec. 67.401(f) adds language that explicitly provides that
   the Federal Air Surgeon may withdraw the Authorization or SODA. An
   Authorization or SODA may be withdrawn at any time for (1) adverse
   change in medical condition, (2) failure to comply with its provisions,
   (3) potential endangerment of public safety, (4) failure to provide
   medical information, or (5) the making or causing to be made of a
   statement that is covered by Sec. 67.403. 22. Final Sec. 67.401(i)
   permits a person to request that the Federal Air Surgeon review a
   decision to withdraw an Authorization or SODA. The request for a review
   must be made within 60 days of the service of the letter that withdrew
   the Authorization or SODA. The review procedures will be on an
   expedited basis and will provide the affected holder of an
   Authorization or SODA a full opportunity to respond to a withdrawal by
   submitting appropriate supporting evidence. 23. Final Sec. 67.403
   differs from current Sec. 67.20 by providing for denial of an airman
   medical certificate if the application for an airman medical
   certificate is falsified. Though this consequence is implied, the
   current regulation specifically provides only for revocation or
   suspension of certificates. Additionally, Sec. 67.403 provides for
   denial or withdrawal of any Authorization or SODA if the information
   provided to obtain it is incorrect, either knowingly or unknowingly.
   Finally, Sec. 67.403(c) makes an unknowingly incorrect statement that
   the FAA relied upon in making its decisions regarding an application
   for an airman medical certificate or a request for an Authorization or
   SODA, a basis for denial, revocation, or suspension of an airman
   medical certificate and the denial or withdrawal of an Authorization or
   SODA. 24. A new Sec. 67.415 provides that the holder of any medical
   certificate that is suspended or revoked shall, upon the
   Administrator's request, return it to the Administrator. The FAA
   practice always has been to request return of the certificate in such
   circumstances to avoid any misunderstanding as to the validity of the
   certificate. 25. Where appropriate, changes are made to eliminate
   gender-specific pronouns, to replace ``applicant'' with ``person,'' to
   use current position titles and addresses, to correct spelling and
   improve syntax, and to adjust section and paragraph references.
