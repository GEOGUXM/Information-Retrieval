   HOW TO REGISTER WITH PRO-NET

                                 Privacy Statement

        If your company is a small business, as defined in the SBA's online
        size standard reference (Small Business Size Standards matched to
        North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes), and
        you have not been debarred from furnishing materials, supplies or
        services to the the Federal Government, you are eligible to be on
        PRO-Net.

        Press the "Register New Profile" button below. We suggest that you
        print the blank profile form to use as a guide to assemble the
        information needed to complete the form. We have provided hot links
        to help you look up codes which may be unfamiliar to you. The more
        information you provide, the more likely your company will be found
        in searches.

        Be sure to fill in the MANDATORY fields and use the formats shown on
        the right side of the form. The MANDATORY fields are:

        * Name of Firm: Up to 80 characters
        * EIN: In this format: 99-9999999 - Questions on EIN numbers can be
          obtained from the IRS at -
          http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/bus_info/pub1635.html. Be very
          careful entering your EIN because, once entered, you cannot change
          it without contacting the SBA.
        * Main Office or Branch Office: You can have only one main office in
          PRO-Net, but you can register multiple branch offices with
          different addresses, phone numbers, etc. If you're not sure whether
          or not you're already registered in PRO-Net, you can search before
          registering. Be very careful entering whether the profile is for a
          main or branch office because, once entered, you cannot change it
          without contacting the SBA.
        * Address, line 1: Up to 60 characters
        * City: Up to 30 characters
        * State: Select from the drop down list on the form
        * Zip and Zip+4 Code: 99999-9999
        * Phone Number: 999-999-9999
        * Fax Number (Either Fax Number or E-mail Address): 999-999-9999
        * E-mail Address (Either Fax Number or E-mail Address): up to 50
          characters
        * NAICS Codes: Up to 25 NAICS codes, up to 6 numeric digits long,
          separated by commas. To look up codes pertinent to your business,
          visit the SBA's NAICS Search Page. NAICS codes are often used to
          search for companies.
        * Keywords: Up to 25 words, up to 20 characters long, separated by
          commas. (Example: "ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING, INSTALLATION, REPAIR".)
          Use words that identify what your company sells or services you
          provide.
        * Choose Password: The password must be at least 6 characters long,
          no more than 30 characters long and can be any printable character,
          including spaces and punctuation, with the exception of
          double-quote.

        The SBA will review your application, and if acceptable, will
        activate it to become available in searches. You can verify that
        your profile has been activated (usually the next work day) by
        performing a search for your company.

      Note: PRO-Net does "duplicates detection", as follows:
        * For a given DUNS or EIN, there can be at most 1 Main office.
        * All Main offices must have DUNS+4 equal to 0000 (regardless of what
          their DUNS+4 may be outside of PRO-Net).
        * All Branch offices must have DUNS+4 NOT equal to 0000 and not equal
          to any other office with the same EIN or DUNS.

      Some users have entered an entire profile, only to have the submission
      rejected as a duplicate of one they had entered earlier and forgotten.
      To save you from this sort of wasted effort, you can pre-search for
      your company's DUNS and/or EIN here. You can also pre-search at the
      main search page, where you can also enter multiple DUNS and/or company
      name. In either case, you can return here using your browser's "Back"
      button.

      Also see our Mailing Lists: Press Releases, Newsletters, Publications,
      etc.

      We suggest you pre-search from here:


         DUNS: _________  (9 digits)
   and/or EIN: __________ (99-9999999 format)
     See whether we've already registered
