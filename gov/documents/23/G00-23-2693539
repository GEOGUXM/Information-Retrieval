                            The Executive Summary

                        [Labday55.gif] [Labday78.gif]

                     Start of assembly and "First Light"
      55 days and 78 days respectively after defining the requirements.
                    The blue panels are foam insulation.

                                 The Details



             [Assembly_1.gif] [Assembly_2.gif] [Assembly_3.gif]

                 Left: Base; Middle: Base with shock mounts;
             Right: Base with frame to house Integrating sphere;



                      [Assembly_4.gif] [Assembly_5.gif]

             Left: Bottom plate and Invar metering truss added;
                Right: Thermal enclosure support frame added.



                      [Assembly_6.gif] [final_int.gif]

          Left: First 1/4 inch aluminum plates for thermal control;
   Right: Fully assembled instrument. The "gold" baffle sits on top of the
       star plate and extends to just below the camera optics. The top
    cylinder is the Cryotiger cooler and the next to top cylinder is the
     dewar housing the CCD. The interior aluminum walls are temperature
   regulated with thermal-electric-coolers/heaters. The blue Labsphere can
                           be seen in the bottom.

     Left: Invar metering structure, top plate holds camera, base plate
                       holds rotating interface plate.
    Right: Rotating interface plate for attachment of integrating sphere
                            below and star plate.

   Camera head (no optics), top cylinder has CryoTiger cold finger, bottom
                              cylinder has CCD.
