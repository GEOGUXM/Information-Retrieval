    Curriculum Integration Through Solar Education (CITSEP) Summer 2001 !

   The first CITSEP workshop was, indeed, a unanimous success! Twenty-five
   educators from six elementary schools across the island of Puerto Rico
   came to the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez for the unique
   opportunity to learn about the only star visible to us during the day:
   The Sun. They experienced new methods for utilizing the Sun as an
   integrated element in their curriculum. Little did they know that this
   weeklong experience would enrich not only their minds, but their hearts
   and souls as well!

   These next few pages will take you on a journey from the lecture halls
   of the Mayaguez campus, through the mangroves and the crystal clear
   waters of the coral reefs.

   Day One: Solar Terrestrial Probes (STP) Education Office personnel
   provide an overview of the STP program. Teachers use Telescopes and
   sunspot kits to study and document sunspot activity during the week.

   Day One: White light can be separated into the many colors of the
   spectrum! Teachers make simple spectroscopes and are amazed at the
   vibrant colors.

   In the above photos, teachers assemble the spectroscopes using
   cardboard boxes, diffraction gratings, tape and scissors. Using a
   flashlight or spectrum analysis tubes of helium, hydrogen and neon, the
   teachers use the spectroscopes to evaluate emissions of the different
   substances.

                                                         Spectrum glasses?

   Day Two: Presentations and experiments help the teachers understand
   magnetic fields on the sun and the earths magnetosphere. Some even
   expressed their own creativity using magnets and metal filings!

                                                 Presentations to teachers

   Day Three: Visit to the Ramey Solar Observatory in Aguadilla. This
   facility is one of five Air Force solar optical observatories
   strategically located around the world to allow for 24-hour monitoring
   of the sun. The observatory is operated by Detachment 3 of the 55th
   Space Weather Squadron, Air Force Weather Agency.

   Day Four: UV radiation presentation at the Marine Station on the island
   of Magueyes. Teachers in the photograph below are learning about the
   effects of UV light on land and marine plants as well as other forms of
   marine life.

   Dr. Juan is holding a sample of a living coral. Behind the group is an
   example of a coral reef with coral rubble brought in by storms. A
   pre-service teacher is holding a white sea-urchin, it's edible! Behind
   her are red mangroves. Many of these urchins pick up pieces of marine
   plants and debris and cover themselves as a protection from intense
   solar radiation.


   After studying the affects of sunlight on coral and marine life at the
   reefs, educators were given a tour through the mangrove mazes off the
   coast of Parguera.

   No, we did not put a spell on one of our teachers! This a Cyclura, a
   species of iguana imported from Cuba when Magueyes was used as a zoo.
   As many of our teachers found out, this island inhabitant is NOT a shy
   guy!

   Comments from our participants:

      I acquired knowledge that I will share with my colleagues and
     students. Since the sun is such a broad theme, could you offer a
     second workshop where we can expand on the sun-earth connection and
     the water resources?

      The presenters were excellent resources and the activities
     presented were excellent. They were well prepared and willing to
     share and cooperate. I think that workshops such as this one offer
     an enriching opportunity for our teachers to expand their knowledge,
     thus our students knowledge

      The activities and field trips were an incredible experience. The
     workshop fulfilled my expectations and I hope to be able to transmit
     (all this information) not only to my students but to my colleagues
     as well. Everything was excellent, keep up the good work!

      Everything was fabulous, perfect! You are doing a marvelous task
     in preparing Puerto Rican teachers in the well being of the
     students, especially in science where students need all of this
     information and motivation.

     It was an interesting and enriching experience

      The organization of the workshop was fabulous, the presenters
     excellent and the food marvelous. The workshop is good and it will
     allow us to take what we learned and pass it on to my students.

     Thanks for visiting us!
