                     General SEACAS Software Information

                         Privacy and Security Notice

   [Sandia National Laboratories]
     __________________________________________________________________

                                INTRODUCTION

   The Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) Engineering Analysis Code Access
   System (SEACAS) is a collection of structural and thermal codes and
   utilities developed and used by analysts at SNL. The name "SEACAS"
   refers to the whole suite of copyrighted Sandia computer codes, but the
   codes included in a specific "SEACAS Distribution" will vary depending
   on the requestor's needs and licensing requests. For more information,
   see the SEACAS Documentation page.

   The balance of this web page is divided into four sections
     * Limitations / Reservations
     * Licensing Interactions
     * SEACAS Information and Description
     * SEACAS Distribution Fee

   SEACAS Documentation is available here
     __________________________________________________________________

                         LIMITATIONS / RESERVATIONS

   Important Limitations:
   (PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE CONTINUING)

   SEACAS software can NOT be licensed to any of the following:
     * Non-U.S. Citizens,
     * Non-U.S. Companies,
     * Non-U.S. Agencies,
     * Non-U.S. Sites.

   Hence, please do NOT request licensing for SEACAS software from this
   web site:
     * If you are NOT a U.S. citizen;
     * If the company you represent is NOT a U.S. company;
     * If the agency you represent is NOT a U.S. agency;
     * If the installation site where this software would be used is NOT
       located in the U.S.

  Copyright and Export Control:

   Our executable codes have been developed for the Department of Energy.
   We distribute the codes to you in the Government's interests,
   non-commercially, under nonexclusive agreements, either for Government
   use under contract or to encourage scientific collaboration aimed at
   further development and application of our codes.

   Certain libraries, such as NETCDF, and some subroutines are copyrighted
   to others, not to Sandia Corporation. Their use is by permission of the
   authors and we comply with the conditions for their distribution.

   Sandia is committed to a policy of adherence to all United States
   export control laws and regulations. The export of information,
   technical data, software, or hardware will be accomplished in
   accordance with United States Federal Agencies' export control
   regulations.

   SEACAS codes do not have security classifications, but they are under
   export control, some more restrictively than others, so their use is
   restricted to U.S. citizens for the most part. Be careful about
   allowing persons who are not United States citizens to have access to
   the codes in any format---source code, binary libraries, or
   executables. This includes persons who are considered permanent
   residents of this country. Simply seeing a listing of source codes or
   executing a code can constitute an export. This can be a very real
   concern in university settings where a multi-national research group is
   common, and there is a strong possibility of encountering non-US
   citizens.

   The licensee shall abide by the export control laws and regulations of
   the United States Department of Commerce and other United States
   governmental regulations relating to the export of Sandia Software.
   Failure to obtain an export control license or other authority from the
   Government may result in criminal liability under U.S. laws.

   If you have a student or a person working for you who is not a United
   States citizen, he or she cannot have any access to some of the codes
   in SEACAS. Also, if that person is from certain proscribed countries or
   belongs to a proscribed group, he or she cannot use ANY of the codes in
   SEACAS.

  User and System Responsibilities:

   Our code is "almost" freely provided, but it is not shareware,
   freeware, or open source. It did not come from the Internet and it was
   not downloaded from a bulletin board. It is not to be released to the
   public. COMMERCIAL USE OR APPLICATION OF OUR CODES WITHOUT A COMMERCIAL
   LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

   We suggest precautions such as the following be applied to the codes in
   SEACAS:
     * All users and system managers should know the terms of the code
       agreements, particularly those parts that pertain to non-commercial
       usage and foreign access The System Manager, or whoever would do
       these backups, should be able to control access to the backup
       files.
     * We suggest the codes be given the same level of protection as
       payroll and personnel files or proprietary information. We believe
       that the codes, on their original cartridge and in any backup form,
       should be kept in a locked desk or a locked file drawer. User
       access should be limited to those in your group who need to have
       access. World access should not be given to the codes.
     * We are concerned about intruders. We anticipate that you will make
       your system as secure as possible and install system security
       updates promptly. We do not prohibit you from using the Internet,
       anonymous ftp, and guest accounts, but these functions should be
       partitioned as securely as possible from the codes. Also, please do
       not interconnect your equipment or your LAN with a LAN that may not
       be as secure as yours.

       review a sample license and complete and send to Sandia a
       Participant Data Sheet (PDS) and a non-commercial software
       licensing request form. If your request meets Sandiaâ€™s objectives,
       Sandia will return a legal agreement for you to complete along with
       a Distribution Fee Invoice Form. Once you return a signed copy of
       the agreement and necessary payment, we will send you a copy of the
       codes you request.

  Types of Non-Commercial Licenses Available:

   The following types of Non-Commercial Licenses are available. Sample
   copies of the licensing agreements (in Microsoft Word format) are
   provided as links following each description.
     * "Government Agency Use" refers to use by an agency of the U.S.
       government. e.g. Air Force, Army, Navy facilities, other DOE & DoD
       research labs. government.agency.use.license.sample.doc

       restricted.non-commercial.use.license.sample.doc

   The rights for a party to use Sandia intellectual property are conveyed
   through a license that is signed by our laboratory and a licensee. We
   would ask that you please review the SAMPLE research licenses that are
   listed above. Please note that these SAMPLE licenses may differ from
   the license that may be sent to you due to statutory requirements,
   requirements imposed by Sandia's contract with the United States
   Department of Energy, and Sandia's Technology Transfer business
   objectives. If the terms and conditions, subject to the above
   constraints will be acceptable to you, then please so indicate when you
   complete the Technology Transfer Participant Data Sheet (PDS) that is
   described below.

   If you would like to request licensing for SEAMS or COYOTE or JAS3D or
   PRONTO3D or some combination of this SEACAS software for one of these
   three types of non-commercial usages, please obtain the SEACAS
   Non-Commercial Licensing Request Packet (a Word .doc file) by clicking
   on the following link.
   SEACAS.non-commercial.licensing.request.packet.doc

  Contents of the SEACAS Non-Commercial Licensing Request Packet:

   The SEACAS Non-Commercial Licensing Request Packet contains 2 sections:
    1. the "SEACAS Non-Commercial Software Licensing Request Form"
       (Names the specific software package for which licensing is being
       requested, allows the requester to provide information about the
       computer platforms where the software would be installed and about
       the type of electronic media that should be used to transmit the
       software package to the requester once the license has been granted
       and the Distribution Fee collected.)
    2. the "Technology Transfer Participant Data Sheet" (PDS)
       (Allows the requester to provide information about the requester's
       company or agency that will help Sandia to prepare the appropriate
       non-commercial licensing agreement for the software package being
       requested. Note that Sandia could decide that none of the available
       non-commercial licenses apply to this requester and then the
       request would be denied.)

  What to Do with the SEACAS Non-Commercial Licensing Request Packet:

   Print out a hard copy of the two forms present in the downloaded file,
   fill in the blank lines and boxes, and answer the questions on both
   forms, and mail both completed forms to:
   Sharon Healy
       Sandia National Laboratories
       Dept. 9143, M.S. 0827
       P. O. Box 5800
       Albuquerque, NM 87185-0827
       Phone: (505) 844-8872
       Fax: (505) 844-4523
       E-Mail: slhealy@sandia.gov

   or
   Complete both forms electronically and email copies to
       slhealy@sandia.gov.

   You may also fax a signed copy of the PDS to the fax number above and
   indicate that the original is in the mail. This early information may
   reveal issues (for example export control) that will have to be
   resolved. Please remember to indicate your agreement to the terms and
   conditions as shown in the SAMPLE license documents (or to similar
   terms and conditions on either the PDS form or in your email or fax
   communications to us). If you have not already mentioned the subject
   elsewhere, please provide a brief two or three sentence description of
   how you believe that the specific code packages requested might be used
   in your research.

   Please print, sign, and mail the original signed copy of the PDS to the
   address above. We must have the signed original before any legal
   documents will be sent to you.

   When completing the PDS, please note that since the arrangement with
   Sandia will involve the payment of money and if your company has a
   billing department with specific processes and procedures, you must
   complete item 2.4 in the PDS.

  SEACAS Non-Commercial Licensing Request Packet Processing Info:

   Your request will be reviewed; you will be notified by e-mail or
   regular mail if anything is missing from your SEACAS Licensing Request
   Packet. If it appears that Sandia cannot process your request because
   of licensing restrictions that disqualify your company from receiving
   this software we will notify you as soon as such a decision is reached.

   Assuming that your licensing request(s) is (are) approved, two (2)
   copies of the appropriate license forms for each software package
   requested will be prepared and sent along with two (2) copies of the
   Distribution Fee Invoice Form to you. You will then need to have all
   copies of the license forms signed by an authorized individual at your
   company, agency or educational institution, keep one copy for each
   software package requested for your files, and return the second signed
   copy to Sandia via fax or regular mail.

   Please note that if there is any disagreement over the wording present
   in the signed license forms that you received from Sandia, then you
   should wait to send in your Distribution Fee Invoice Form until the
   licensing issues have been resolved successfully. We would prefer to
   NOT collect the distribution fee before reaching agreement on the
   licensing terms!

   If the licensing forms are acceptable to your company, have been signed
   by your company official and one (1) copy of those forms is being
   returned to Sandia in an unmodified state then you should also complete
   both copies of the Distribution Fee Invoice Forms indicating a payment
   by check or providing the necessary credit card information and
   signature and return one of the completed forms as directed on the form
   to Sandia. The second copy of the Distribution Fee Invoice Form is for
   your records to keep along with your copy of the signed license forms.

   Both the signed license forms and the Distribution Fee payment must be
   received by Sandia before the software distribution can be prepared for
   shipment. Once both items have been received by Sandia the software
   distribution will be prepared according to the original "SEACAS
   Software Licensing Request Form" you submitted and will be mailed to
   the Technical Point of Contact individual named on the "Technology
   Transfer Participant Data Sheet" you submitted.
