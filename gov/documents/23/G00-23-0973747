   Recreation Guide
   The King County Park System offers dozens of recreational opportunities
   for you and your family.

   We feature lots of fun classes and activities for kids, teens, adults,
   families and seniors! Our classes can bring out your creative side...or
   help you get fit...introduce your kids to dance, sports, or just other
   kids! We can teach you how to swim or take you on trips around the
   Puget Sound region.

   But recreation is not just about classes. Plan an outing and enjoy the
   great outdoors! We have lots of great ideas.

   Plan a great big picnic for all your friends or family. We have
   "in-city" and "out in the country" parks with shelters, built-in BBQ's
   and picnic tables.

   Learn about the flora and fauna in this beautiful and abundant area. We
   have naturalists who will guide you through King County parks to
   discover out-of-the-way wetlands, songbirds or cougars. Or, just get in
   touch with your senses and enjoy the tranquility only a natural
   experience can provide.

   How about an adventure on the water? The King County Park System has
   day and overnight moorage sites, a few boat launches and several shores
   from which to put in your canoe, kayak or inner tube.

   We even offer camping if you're interested in a quick overnight
   getaway.

   The King County Park System has over 170 parks and natural areas, 14
   Regional Trails and 17 swimming pools.

   We also offer a variety of day and overnight experiences for people
   with developmental disabilities.
