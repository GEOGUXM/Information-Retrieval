        Non-Government Materials and Processes (M&P) Standards Homepage


  Cassini Project   Mars Pathfinder   Millennium Project

Last update June 13, 1996

This Homepage, which is accessible via the World Wide Web (WWW) was established
on March 7, 1996 to serve as a tool to provide information on the NASA M&P
Standards program.  This Homepage is under the direct responsibility of JPL
and is developed in coordination with NASA's Office of Chief Engineer, NASA
Headquarters, Code AE and Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Huntsville, AL.
The NASA HQ coordinator is Richard Weinstein and the MSFC manager for the M&P
Program is Frank Key.  The JPL M&P Standards Coordinator is Cheng Hsieh and
the alternates are Yoseph Bar-Cohen and Tim O'Donnell.

As part of NASA HQ effort in the area of Materials and Processes Standards,
a NASA Working Group was established. Each of the NASA Centers is represented by
a lead Coordinator and at least one Alternate.
