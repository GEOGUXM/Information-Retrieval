   M"uller May 11, 2000 ABSTRACT This report describes a
   computer-accessible catalog of submillimeter, millimeter, and microwave
   spectral lines in the frequency range between 0 and 10,000 GHz (i.e.,
   wavelengths longer than 30 um). The catalog can be used as a planning
   guide or as an aid in the identification and analysis of observed
   spectral lines. The information listed for each spectral line includes
   the frequency and its estimated error, the intensity, the lower state
   energy, and the quantum number assignment. This edition of the catalog
   has information on 298 atomic and molecular species and includes a
   total of 1,448,153 lines. The catalog has been constructed by using
   theoretical least squares fits of published spectral lines to accepted
   molecular models. The associated predictions and their estimated errors
   are based upon the resultant fitted parameters and their covariances.
   Future versions of this catalog will add more atoms and molecules and
   update the present listings as new data appear. The catalog is
   available on-line via anonymous ftp at spec.jpl.nasa.gov and on the
   world wide web at http://spec.jpl.nasa.gov. iiiiv FOREWORD Revision 2
   of the Submillimeter Spectral Line Catalog incorporated a number of
   changes: (1) a quantum number format, (2) addition of a complete set of
   partition functions for each species, (3) a computer-accessible
   directory of species, (4) a table of relative abundances of the
   isotopes under terrestrial conditions, (5) a new format for the
   individual species descriptions, (6) eighteen new species, and (7)
   thirty revised species. The present version is changed only by the
   addition of new and revised species. The changes are as follows: NEW

   . . . . . . . . . 14 ix 1 INTRODUCTION This report describes a
   computer-accessible catalog of submillimeter, millimeter, and microwave
   spectral lines in the frequency range between 0 and 10,000 GHz (i.e.,
   wavelengths longer than 30 um). The catalog is intended to be used as a
   guide in the planning of spectral line observations and as a reference
   that can facilitate identification and analysis of observed spectral
   lines. The selection of lines for the catalog is based on the project
   needs of astronomers and atmospheric scientists. The catalog is
   constructed using theoretical least squares fits and predictions based
   on spectral lines, mostly obtained from the literature. In subsequent
   versions of the catalog, more molecules will be added and existing
   molecular listings will be updated as new data appear. The catalog is
   available on-line via anonymous ftp at spec.jpl.nasa.gov and on the
   world wide web at http://spec.jpl.nasa.gov. The format of the data is
   given in Section 2. Section 3 gives conversions between different
   measures of spectral line intensity. General comments on the precision
   of the spectral line positions and intensities are given in Section 4,
   while species-specific comments are reserved for Section 6. Section 5
   gives the format of quantum numbers as they appear in the catalog.
   Documentation for each molecular or atomic species is listed in Section
   6 in order of the "species tag." This tag is a six-digit number in
   which the three most significant digits represent the mass number of
   the molecule or atom and the last three digits are an accession number
   for the given mass. Usually there is a separate tag for each
   vibration-electronic state of a particular molecule. 2 DATA FORMAT 2.1
   Line Files The catalog line files are composed of 80-character lines,
   with one line entry per spectral line. The format of each line is:
   FREQ, ERR, LGINT, DR, ELO, GUP, TAG, QNFMT, QN0, QN00 (F13.4, F8.4,
   F8.4, I2, F10.4, I3, I7, I4, 6I2, 6I2) 1 FREQ: Frequency of the line in
   MHz. ERR: Estimated or experimental error of FREQ in MHz. LGINT: Base
   10 logarithm of the integrated intensity in units of nm2*MHz at 300 K.
   (See Section 3 for conversions to other units.) DR: Degrees of freedom
   in the rotational partition function (0 for atoms, 2 for linear
   molecules, and 3 for nonlinear molecules). ELO: Lower state energy in
   cm-1 relative to the lowest energy spin- rotation level in ground
   vibronic state. GUP: Upper state degeneracy. TAG: Species tag or
   molecular identifier. A negative value flags that the line frequency
   has been measured in the laboratory. The absolute value of TAG is then
   the species tag and ERR is the reported experimental error. The three
   most significant digits of the species tag are coded as the mass number
   of the species, as explained above. QNFMT: Identifies the format of the
   quantum numbers given in the field QN. These quantum number formats are
   given in Section 5 and are different from those in the first two
   editions of the catalog. QN0: Quantum numbers for the upper state coded
   according to QNFMT. QN00: Quantum numbers for the lower state. 2.2
   Directory File The catalog contains a special directory file called
   catdir.cat Each element of this directory is an 80-character record
   with the following format: TAG, NAME, NLINE, QLOG, VERSION (I6,X, A13,
   I6, 7F7.4, I2) TAG: The species tag or molecular identifier. NAME: An
   ASCII name for the species. NLINE: The number of lines in the catalog.
   QLOG: A seven-element vector containing the base 10 logarithm of the
   partition function for temperatures of 300 K, 225 K, 150 K, 75 K, 37.5
   K, 18.75 K, and 9.375 K, respectively. VERSION: The version of the
   calculation for this species in the catalog. 2.3 Documentation files
   The documentation files are stored natively as ASCII LaTex files for
   each species. Postscript, LaTex, and PDF versions of this publication
   are also available on line. The documentation files provide the
   intensity and frequency cut-offs, partition functions at representative
   temperatures, assumed dipole moments, literature citations for the
   experimental lines, and a brief description of the nature of the
   Hamiltonian model 2 used in the calculation. The documentation file
   also includes a suggested isotopic correction based on cosmic
   abundances. This correction includes the appropriate statistics for
   equivalent nuclei. Note the catalog intensities do not include this
   isotopic correction. In this edition of the catalog, several of the
   species have spectra that are extended to 10,000 GHz, so the
   documentation includes a maximum frequency cutoff. For almost all
   species, a strength cutoff was also employed: 10LGINT > 10LOGSTR0 +
   (*/300GHz)2 * 10LOGSTR1 A blank entry for LOGSTR1 means that the second
   term was not included. We have found that LOGSTR1 is often a useful
   cut-off parameter to account for the decreased sensitivity of
   instrumentation with increasing frequency or as a means to capture
   lines with comparable transition dipoles. The partition functions
   listed (Q) in the catalog include rotation and spin statistics but
   usually do not include vibrational or electronic corrections.
   (Exceptions such as H2O and O3 are noted.) Calculation of Q is based on
   a sum over states. At higher temperatures, the sum-over-states
   calculation is replaced by a classical calculation when the latter is
   larger due to a limited number of states in the catalog. The spin
   statistics included in the partition function are sometimes divided by
   a common factor, but the partition functions are always consistent with
   the statistics used for intensities in the catalog. This common factor
   is not always documented, but the choice should be clear from the GUP
   field in the line file. 3 INTENSITY UNITS AND CONVERSIONS The units of
   intensity given in the catalog, nm2*MHz, are based on the integral of
   the absorption cross-section over the spectral line shape. The value of
   the intensity is calculated for 300 K and is directly comparable with
   the common infrared intensity unit of cm-1/(molecule/cm2). The latter
   is obtainable by dividing the catalog intensity by 2.99792458 * 1018.
   The line intensity in the catalog, Iba (300 K), is obtained from Iba(T
   ) = (8ss3/3hc)*ba xSba u2x[e-E00/kT - e-E0/kT ]/Qrs (1) = 4.16231 *
   10-5*ba xSba u2x[e-E00/kT - e-E0/kT ]/Qrs (2) where *ba is the line
   frequency, xSba is the line strength, ux is the dipole moment along the
   molecular axis x, E00 and E0 are the lower and upper state energies,
   respectively, and Qrs is the rotation-spin partition function (using
   the same zero of energy as E0 and E00). In Eq.(2), Iba has units of
   nm2*MHz, *ba has units of MHz, and ux has units of Debye. In many
   molecules, there are several dipole moment projections and there even
   may be mixing between dipoles. In such cases, xSba u2x is replaced with
   the sum of the squares of the transition dipoles for each M component
   in the line. For magnetic dipole transitions, Eq.(2) can be used with
   the conversion that a Bohr magneton 3 is equivalent to 0.009274 Debye.
   Note that with this definition the intensities are defined with respect
   to the total concentration of the vibration-electronic state of the
   species. No vibrational partition function is included, except where
   explicitly stated in the documentation. Care is taken to assure that
   xSba and Qrs are determined with the same state degeneracies. For the
   catalog, Eq. (2) is evaluated for T = T ffi = 300 K. Values of Iba at
   other temperatures can also be obtained from Eq.(1) once the
   temperature dependence of Qrs is known. For linear molecules, Qrs is
   proportional to T in the limit where the energy spacings are small
   compared with kT. For nonlinear molecules, Qrs is proportional to T3/2
   in the same limit. Explicitly, Iba(T) is Iba(T ) =
   Iba(Tffi)[Qrs(Tffi)/Qrs(T )] e- E00/kT - e-E0/kT e-E00/kTffi -
   e-E0/kTffi (3), = Iba(Tffi) * (Tffi/T )n+1e-(1/T -1/Tffi)E 00/k (4)
   where n = 1 for a linear molecule and 3/2 for a nonlinear molecule.
   Eq.(4) requires that E0 - E00 is small compared with kT and kTffi.
   Absorption coefficients of collision-broadened lines can be obtained
   from Iba with the relation ffmax = Iba(T )\Delta * (Tffi/T ) * 102.458
   cm-1 (5) in which \Delta * is the half-width at half-height in MHz at 1
   torr partial pressure of the absorber at temperature T, Iba is in units
   of nm2*MHz, and ffmax is in units of cm-1. The power transmission
   through a uniform medium of length L at the peak of the line is
   exp(-ffmaxL). The attenuation is ffmaxL * 4.3429 in dB. The
   corresponding value of ffmax in the thermal Doppler limit is ffmax =
   Iba(T )p\Delta * d (Tffi/T ) * 151.194 cm -1 (6) in which p is the
   partial pressure of the absorber in torr, and \Delta *d is the Doppler
   half-width at half-height in units of MHz. The Doppler width is given
   by \Delta *d = 1.17221 * 10-6 * *baq(T /Tffi)(28/m) (7) in which m is
   the mass of the absorber (in atomic mass units). The explicit inverse
   temperature dependence in Eqs.(5) - (6) is due to the conversion of
   density to pressure units. There is additional implicit temperature
   dependence in Iba(T ) and in the widths. In Eqs.(7) - (10), *ba is the
   line frequency in MHz. The absorption cross-section of an interstellar
   absorber integrated over a 1 km/svelocity interval is oeba = Iba* ba *
   2.99792 * 10 -9 cm2. (8) The power transmission through a uniform
   medium of length L and number density ae is exp(-oebaaeL). The inverse
   of oeba is the column density per unit optical depth in the same 1
   km/s-velocity interval. 4 The average spontaneous emission rate from
   the upper states into the lower states is Aba = Iba(T )
   *2ba[Qrs/g0][e-E00/kT - e-E0/kT ]-1 * 2.7964 * 10-16 sec-1 (9), =
   Iba(Tffi) *ba[Qrs(Tffi)/g0]eE0/kTffi * 1.748 * 10-9 sec-1 (10) in which
   g0 is the degeneracy of the upper state. The value of g0 is listed as
   part of the spectral line information in the catalog. Values of Qrs are
   listed in the documentation and on the directory file. Eq.(10) requires
   that h*ba is small compared with kT and kTffi. It should be noted that
   the information to make all the intensity conversions given above is
   available from the directory file and from the line files, with the
   exception of the collisional broadening coefficients. As a matter of
   policy, we have not included collisional linewidths in the catalog
   because of the large variety of different collision partners relevant
   for the laboratory, the Earth's atmosphere, and the atmospheres of the
   other planets. 4 GENERAL COMMENTS ON PRECISION The expected errors of
   the frequency as listed in the catalog are usually based on a
   propagation of errors estimated from a least squares fit of the
   observed frequencies to a model Hamiltonian, using the following
   equation: "2n = X kj @*n @pk @*n @pj Vkj (11) in which "n is the
   estimated error of frequency *n and Vkj is an element of the least
   square variance-covariance matrix for the parameters pk. This
   variance-covariance matrix is determined from the observed lines by (V
   -1)kj = X m @*m @pk @*m @pj "- 2m (12) in which the summation over m is
   over the experimental lines using experimental uncertainies, "m. The
   diagonal elements of V are the squares of the parameter uncertainties
   and the off-diagonal elements of V are products of the parameter
   uncertainties and correlation coefficients. The experimental
   uncertainties generally given in the literature vary from 1.6- oe
   estimates to 3-oe estimates and are usually "guesstimates."
   Unfortunately, many authors do not even report their experimental
   uncertainties. Therefore, the expected errors in predicted lines
   obtained from fits based on such data will usually reflect this
   ambiguity in laboratory uncertainties through Eq. (10) and (11). In
   some cases, the quality of the least squares fit of the parameters to
   the experimental lines can be a guide to the statistical nature of the
   experimental uncertainties. Whenever possible, 5 the expected errors in
   this catalog will reflect an expected 95% confidence interval based on
   the model used to fit the data. However, the errors can be different
   from this design goal by factors of three just due to the quality of
   the input error estimates. Lines with an expected error greater than 1
   GHz have been dropped from the catalog. The expected errors can only be
   computed relative to the model used. There are at least two ways the
   model can be "wrong" for the predicted frequencies. First, higher order
   centrifugal distortion terms may no longer be negligible for the
   predicted frequencies. This effect will generally be important for
   lines of higher J or K than the laboratory-determined data set. In a
   sense, the predictions are then a form of extrapolation rather than
   interpolation and are therefore more suspect. A second factor leading
   to discrepancies in the predicted frequencies comes from "resonances."
   These resonances come from a near overlap of energy states that are
   coupled by elements of the Hamiltonian matrix. Poor predictability
   comes when these elements are neglected in the model or are treated
   inadequately by some form of perturbation theory. Such a neglect of
   coupling elements is always necessary at some level in any practical
   calculation. A major contributing problem is that often the existing
   data set is not sensitive to the parameters that are needed to
   characterize the resonances. Precision in the intensity estimates is
   generally less critical than precision in the frequency. Contributing
   to intensity uncertainty are errors in the dipole moment, errors in the
   line strength xSba, and errors in the rotation-spin partition function
   (the vibration-electronic partition defined on the basis of
   concentrations of the given vibration-electronic state). Dipole moment
   errors come directly from the experimental determination and indirectly
   from the J dependence of the dipole moment due to centrifugal mixing of
   the vibrational states. Line strength errors can come from deficiencies
   in the model Hamiltonian and are particularly severe when resonances
   have been inadequately accounted for. Partition function errors are
   relatively benign but can become significant if the classical formulae
   are used at low temperatures for small molecules. With the exception of
   unanticipated resonances and poorly determined dipole moments,
   worst-case errors in the intensity will generally be at the 1% level or
   lower. Many molecular models are found in the literature. In principle,
   a very general model should be able to treat every possible case. In
   practice, this is hardly ever done. A specific model is most frequently
   used for every case, mainly because every author starts with a
   different viewpoint of the problem. In our case, we have tried to
   develop a program that will treat a wide variety of problems with a
   minimum of adaptation. This saves a great deal of time in the initial
   setup, and provides a uniform output format for the final results. Most
   importantly, the basic treatment is the same for every molecule,
   regardless of the model used, so that a high degree of consistency can
   be maintained, facilitating comparisons between different molecules.
   The particular model needed to analyze a specific problem is treated as
   a subroutine. For certain problems, this subroutine can be quite
   simple, but for others, it is more complex. Simple singlet sigma
   diatomic, linear, and symmetric rotor molecules are treated 6 together.
   Asymmetric rotors with and without various complicating interactions
   are treated exactly, without any perturbation expansions. This is done
   by employing the Hamiltonian operators to generate the matrix elements.
   All possible operators can be used, so any conceivable interaction can
   be included initially. Comments on specific models are given for the
   individual species. 5 FORMAT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS For the later editions
   of this catalog, we have attempted to use a quantum number format
   convention that allows the quantum numbers to be accessed easily by
   computer (see Table 1). First, the upper and lower quantum number sets
   have been separated into distinct fields. Second, the quantum format
   designations have been defined to have more accessible information
   encoded in them. The quantum number format designation, QNFMT, is a
   4-digit quantity in the catalog. We divide QNFMT into a series of
   digits so that QNFMT = Q * 100 + H * 10 + N QN in which Q determines
   the type of molecule (see Table 1), H determines the coding of
   half-integer quantum numbers, and NQN is the number of quantum numbers
   for each state. Q is defined so that MOD(Q,5) is the number of primary
   quantum numbers. If NQN is greater than the number of primary quantum
   numbers, the degeneracy is derived from the last quantum number.
   Otherwise, the degeneracy is derived from the first quantum number. H
   is a 3-bit binary code for the existence of half-integer quantum
   numbers for the last three quantum numbers. The least significant bit
   refers to quantum number NQN and is 1 if the last quantum number is
   half-integer. In the catalog, all half-integer quantum numbers are
   rounded up to the next integer. The parity given may not always be
   experimentally determined, but the parity convention is guaranteed to
   produce parities of the same sign for interacting states and to produce
   a change in parity across dipole allowed transitions. It should be
   noted that for symmetric top transitions with no K splitting, the
   parity designation is frequently dropped. Unless otherwise stated
   below, the parity of prolate symmetric tops follows the parity of K+1
   for the corresponding asymmetric top level, while for oblate tops, the
   parity follows K-1. For example, the level 53,2 for an asymmetric rotor
   has K = 3 for a prolate symmetric top quantum field, and K = -2 for an
   oblate top. Hund's case (b) quanta are similar to symmetric top quanta
   except that K is replaced with \Lambda . Hunds's case (a) quanta also
   have parity encoded in the \Lambda field. The correlation between
   parity and e,f designations should follow the recommendations of J. M.
   Brown et al., 1975, J. Mol. Spect. 55, 500. For reference, this
   convention is 7 TABLE 1. QUANTUM NUMBER FORMATS Type Q DR Quantum Order

   1. Half-integer quantum numbers are rounded up. 2. The sign of \Lambda
   and K refers to the parity under inversion of spatial coordinates, not
   the sign of the operator. 3. Quantum numbers in parentheses are
   optional. 8 For odd-spin multiplicity: if p(-1)J+1/2 = -1, then e if
   p(-1)J+1/2 = 1, then f For even-spin multiplicity: if p(-1)J = 1, then
   f if p(-1)J = -1, then e where p is +-1 according to the parity. Care
   must be used because this convention is not universally followed in the
   literature. 6 DOCUMENTATION BY SPECIES In this edition of the catalog,
   several of the species have spectra that are extended to 10,000 GHz, so
   the documentation below includes a maximum frequency cutoff. For almost
   all species, a strength cutoff was also employed: 10LGINT > 10LOGSTR0 +
   (*/300GHz)2 * 10LOGSTR1 A blank entry for LOGSTR1 means that the second
   term was not included. The partition functions listed (Q) include
   rotation and spin statistics but usually do not include vibrational
   corrections. (Exceptions such as H2O and O3 are noted.) Calculation of
   Q is based on a sum over states. At higher temperatures, the
   sum-over-states calculation is replaced by a classical calculation when
   the latter is larger due to a limited number of states in the catalog.
   The spin statistics included are only a partial set but are consistent
   with the intensities in the catalog. 6.1 Isotope Corrections For
   convenience, we have included an isotope correction for the rarer
   isotopes that includes effects of redundant substitution. The atomic
   abundances used are listed in Table 2. It should be stressed that the
   intensities in the catalog do not contain an isotope correction. 9

   data at the highest J values. The quoted errors are expected to be
   about 1/2oe. The fitting method is described in P. Chen et al.. The
   intensities were calculated using the method in C. Camy-Peyret et al.,
   1985, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 113, 208. A value of 1.84718 Debye was used
   along with corrections for the planarity conditions. This agrees will
   with observed IR intensities up to \Delta Ka = 3 transitions. Higher
   order planarity terms are needed for agreement with \Delta Ka = 5, 7,
   9... transitions. The partition function includes the *2 state.
