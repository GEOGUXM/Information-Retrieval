The ASCA Mission
(1993-2001)

   ASCA (formerly named Astro-D) was Japan's fourth cosmic X-ray astronomy
   mission, and the second for which the United States provided part of
   the scientific payload. The satellite was successfully launched on
   February 20, 1993. Attitude control was lost on July 14, 2000 during a
   geomagnetic storm, after which no scientific observations were
   performed. ASCA reentered the atmosphere on March 2, 2001 after more
   than 8 years in orbit.

   The U.S. ASCA Guest Observer Facility (GOF) is located at NASA's
   Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The GOF is part of
   the Office of Guest Investigator Programs (OGIP) in the Laboratory for
   High Energy Astrophysics (LHEA).
   The primary responsibility of the U.S. ASCA GOF is to enable U.S.
   astronomers to make the best use of the ASCA mission, in close
   collaboration with the Japanese ASCA team.
