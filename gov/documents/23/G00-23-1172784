          To make your online request, you will need the following
          information:

        * Your name as it appears on your most recent Social Security card
        * Your Social Security Number
        * Your date and place of birth
        * Your mother's maiden name (to help identify you)
        * Your phone number in case Social Security needs to contact you
          about your request
        * Your e-mail address (optional)
        * Your last payment amount or the month and year you last received a
          payment if you have received benefits in the last 12 months.

     Contact your local Social Security Office.

   If you get benefits from the Railroad Retirement Board, call your local
   RRB office, or call 1-800-808-0772.

   Make sure you have your Medicare number ready when you call. You should
   receive your new card in about four weeks.

   New to Medicare?

   You will receive your Medicare card in the mail 3 months prior to
   eligibility. The Medicare card will include your name, Medicare claim
   number, the type of coverage you have (Part A, Part B, or both), and
   the date your coverage starts.

   Using Your Medicare Card

   Show your card whenever you get medical care. This will assure that a
   claim for payment is sent to Medicare. Make sure to use your exact name
   and claim number. If you are married, your spouse will have his or her
   own card and claim number. Never let anyone else use your Medicare
   card, and keep the number as safe as you would a credit card number.
   Take your card with you when you travel, and have it handy when you
   call about a Medicare claim.
