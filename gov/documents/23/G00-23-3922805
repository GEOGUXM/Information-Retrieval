   What's New on the FRTR Web Pages:
   Although not an exhaustive list, this information should provide the
   most notable changes and announcements on our webserver:

     * 5/31/2001
       56 new cost and performance remediation case study reports added to
       the Roundtable web site.  The new reports cover such relevant
       topics as methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) treatment, groundwater
       treatment optimization, and cleanup of small dry cleaner sites.
       Specific technologies in this update feature varies in situ
       techniques, including bioremediation, flushing, chemical oxidation,
       air sparging, and monitored natural attenuation.
        274 total case study reports are now available on the Roundtable
       web site.

     * 5/23/2001
       New per chlorate information added to
       http://www.frtr.gov/perchlorate


     * 11/15/2000
       Member agencies of the Roundtable updated links to optimization
       resources on the website. Updates include information related to
       optimization of remedial systems, methods to include actions that
       improve protectiveness, reduce cost, and shorten cleanup time
       associated with selected remedies.
     * 3/29/2000
       In March 2000, Member agencies of the Roundtable added
       approximately 70 new case study reports to the Catalog of Case
       Studies - increasing the total to 210!
       These new case studies cover recent applications of technologies
       such as in-situ bioremediation, treatment of debris, permeable
       reactive barriers, multi-phase extraction, in-situ heating,
       phytoremediation, electrokinetic's, bioventing, soil vapor
       extraction, thermal adsorption, groundwater pump and treat,
       incineration and monitored natural attenuation. Look for a full
       broadcast announcement of these new case study reports at the next
       Roundtable meeting scheduled for June 14, 2000.
     * 3/7/2000
       Information on UXO and explosives remediation and organizations
       involved with these activities are provided in this continually
       updated list of interagency information.
     * 2/4/2000
       Environmental Cost Engineering Committee succeeds the Interagency
       Cost Estimating Group. This new interagency group is dedicated to
       improving cost and schedule estimates, scope definitions, effective
       management controls and information sharing. The Committee now
       posts their information on the Federal Remediation Technologies
       Roundtable server.
     * 2/2/2000

     * 5/9/1999
       Announcement - The EPA Training Exchange Announces the 1.5 day
       training course "In Situ Permeable Reactive Barriers: Application
       and Deployment", a training course on the use of permeable reactive
       barriers for remediation and managing contaminated groundwater.
       The training is sponsored by EPA TIO and EPA NRMRL, ITRC and RTDF.
     * 4/6/1999
       Added Link to Federal Environmental Meetings, Conference and
       Announcements
