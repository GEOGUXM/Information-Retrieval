                          Research and Technology

                                  Research

    For decades, JPL and NASA have been exemplary in collecting data from
     different missions, specifically from planetary and earth science.

    OODT is currently exploring a new framework that will provide uniform
   access to existing data. In addition, this framework will be scaleable
       as the size and number of databases grow, and will serve as the
                       interface for future missions.

                                Technologies

     OODT is funded by the Interactive Analysis Environments Program and
         provides focused research using the following technologies:
     * Distributed DATABASE systems
     * Distributed object technoloty
     * Web-based technologies
     * N-Tier Architectures which allow extensibility in all 3 tiers
       (client, applications server, and data server)
     * Design Patterns
     * Interoperability of Data Systems
     * Object and Relational Database Technologies
