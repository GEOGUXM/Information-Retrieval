                        Cashing or Replacing Bonds in
                         Areas Affected by Disaster


    The Bureau of the Public Debt recently took action to assist savings
   bond owners in the New York City and Washington, DC metropolitan areas
      affected by terrorist attacks. We're accelerating replacement of
   missing bonds and have authorized paying agents serving those areas to
     waive the initial 6-month holding period for new savings bonds. The
    waiver remains in effect for up to two months. To find out if you may
      be eligible to cash your bonds early, please contact the Federal
        Reserve Office that processes savings bonds for your region.

   You usually have to wait 6 months before you can cash your savings
   bonds. However, in areas affected by disasters, such as floods, fires,
   hurricanes, and tornadoes, we sometimes allow you to cash bonds that
   are less than 6 months old.

   If your area's recently been affected by a disaster, you may be
   eligible. Check our list of Press Releases to see if financial
   institutions in your area have been authorized to cash bonds less than
   six months old.

   Your bonds may also have been lost or destroyed due to a disaster. We
   can help you get those bonds replaced quickly--just follow the
   instructions in the Press Release. If you need additional information,
   please e-mail us.
