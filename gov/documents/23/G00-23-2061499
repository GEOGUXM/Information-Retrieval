     PDF Files Tips
     * If you get a dialogue box that asks whether you want to open the
       file or save it to disk, choose the option to open it. The Adobe®
       Acrobat® Reader® will then launch to view the publication. After
       you have opened a PDF document in the Adobe® Acrobat® Reader®, you
       can then view, print, or save the document.
     * Use the scroll bar on the side of the screen to move up and down
       the page. Use the arrow buttons on top of the screen to move back
       and forth between pages.
     * To print a document, select the printer icon in the Adobe® Acrobat®
       Reader® browser.
     * To save a PDF document, select "Save As" under the "File" option
       and then select the location where you want the file saved and the
       name of the file.
     * If the Adobe® Acrobat® Reader® browser opens in a separate window,
       use the "Back" button or arrow on your Web browser to return to the
       original page.

     Accessibility Information

     Requesting Alternative Formats of Publications
     On August 7, 1998, President Clinton signed the Workforce Investment
     Act of 1998, which included a revised version of Section 508 of the
     Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This act requires federal agencies to
     ensure electronic and information technology used in their programs
     are accessible to people with disabilities.

     Therefore, we are dedicated to providing alternative formats of
     information provided on TFHRC's Web site that is accessible to
     people with disabilities. For additional information or to request
     an alternative format, please contact the TFHRC Web Site Manager at:
     TFHRC.WebMaster@fhwa.dot.gov

     When requesting an alternative format, please list the specific
     document(s) and the required type of alternative format (visual or
     auditory).
