                      Mission Statement and Description

     The Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (CIAO) was created in
   response to Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in May 1998 as
    a mechanism to assist in the coordination of the Federal Government's
   initiatives on critical infrastructure protection. PDD-63 assigned the
                  following specific missions to the CIAO:

     * Integrating the various infrastructure sector plans into a national
       plan;
     * Coordinating departmental analyses on how to mitigate unacceptable
       risks resulting from the U.S. Government's own dependencies on
       critical infrastructure;
     * Coordinating a national education and awareness program targeted
       toward increasing public understanding and participation in
       protection efforts; and
     * Coordinating legislative and public affairs to integrate
       infrastructure assurance objectives into the public and private
       sectors.

    In implementing its mandates, the CIAO has focused on issues that cut
     across industry sectors and are not the responsibility of existing
      departments and agencies, in order to help ensure a coherent and
   cohesive U.S. approach to the challenges of achieving the protection of
                   our Nation's critical infrastructures.

   In January 2000, the CIAO coordinated the release of the National Plan
     for Information Systems Protection, Version 1.0, for the President.
      This National Plan addresses, for the first time in our Nation's
       history, a complex interagency process for approaching critical
   infrastructure and cyber-related issues in the Federal Government. Our
      work with Federal departments and agencies and the private sector
     continues as we begin development of Version 2.0 of the Plan, which
    outlines a broader framework for critical infrastructure protection.

     In addition to the coordination and implementation of the National
                     Plan, the CIAO is also involved in:

     * Working with the Federal lead agencies and their private industry
       counterparts to establish the Partnership for Critical
       Infrastructure Security, a public-private partnership for the
       purpose of examining crosscutting issues and help secure our
       Nation's critical infrastructures;
     * Supporting a a series of workshops with the Department of Justice
       designed to foster information sharing channels and focusing on
       legal issues, to include the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) ;
     * Compiling recommended practices for identifying and securing
       critical assets and related infrastructure components;
     * Supporting United States United States Project Matrix to identify
       all assets, nodes and networks, and associated infrastructure
       dependencies and interdependencies required for the Federal
       Government to fulfill its responsibilities to the American people
       in the areas of national security, national economic security, and
       critical public health and safety services;
     * Assisting in the coordination of an interagency process for
       developing long-term research and development strategies consistent
       with PDD-63, including public-private efforts focusing Government
       R&D funds on critical infrastructure requirements;
     * Working with the Office of Personnel Management, and the
       Departments of Education and Health and Human Services to create a
       training and education initiative designed to alleviate the
       critical shortage of information security workers nationwide, and
       promote private sector awareness and understanding of information
       security issues throughout the public and academia; and
     * Laying the groundwork for creation of the National Infrastructure
       Assurance Council (NIAC), a Presidential advisory committee
       composed of up to 30 private sector representatives for critical
       infrastructure assurance policy making.
