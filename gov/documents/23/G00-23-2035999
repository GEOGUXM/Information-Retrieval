   Annual Statistical Report on the Social Security Disability Program,
   2000
   Since 1956, the Social Security program has provided cash benefits to
   people with disabilities.  This annual report provides program and
   demographic information on the people who receive those benefits.

   The Widow(er)'s Limit Provision of Social Security
   Working Paper No. 92
   The widow(er)'s limit provision of Social Security establishes caps on
   the benefit amounts of widow(er)s whose deceased spouse filed for early
   retirement benefits. Currently, 33 percent of Social Security's 8.1
   million widow(er) beneficiaries have lower benefits because of that
   provision. This paper describes the widow(er)'s limit provision and
   evaluates proposed changes to it. The proposals considered range from
   the modest (allowing widow(er)s to receive adjustments to the capped
   amounts by delaying receipt of benefits) to the substantial (abolishing
   the widow(er)'s limit).
