   The U.S. Geological Survey has mapped parts of the inner continental
   shelf using high-resolution seismic and sidescan-sonar systems since
   the mid-1970Â’s. These data have proved invaluable in understanding
   sediment dispersal on the inner shelf and the influence of surficial
   and shallow subsurface geology on these dispersal pathways. Advances in
   computer hardware technology have reduced the time between data
   acquisition and map production to the point where processing of
   sidescan-sonar and seismic data is completed in the field coincident
   with data acquisition, and map products are used to design the sampling
   component of the field program. The USGS has developed an integrated
   shipboard data collection, processing, and archival system for digital
   sidescan-sonar and seismic data. There are four main components of the
   Sea-Floor Mapping Group at  the USGS Woods Hole Field Center:
