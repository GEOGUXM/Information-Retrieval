                                SPECIAL ALERT

                                                              FIL-107-2001
                                                         December 21, 2001

   TO:      CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
   SUBJECT: Delays in Mail Delivery to FDIC Addressees in Washington, DC

      Since October 22, 2001, mail service provided by the United States
      Postal Service (USPS) to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
      addressees in Washington, DC, has been disrupted, causing delays in
      mail delivery to the FDIC. The delays are the result of measures that
      the USPS has taken to protect federal employees from anthrax. The two
      FDIC addresses affected are:

        550 17th Street, NW
        Washington, DC 20429

        and

        801 17th Street, NW
        Washington, DC 20434

      Considering these circumstances, you may wish to send any
      time-sensitive mail to FDIC addressees in Washington, DC, using
      alternative services. Private overnight carriers, electronic mail and
      facsimile transmission are possibilities. In addition, the FDIC can
      receive mail in its offices in Arlington, Virginia. USPS service to
      this address has not been affected by the anthrax crisis. Should you
      choose this alternative, please use the following address:

        FDIC
        3501 N. Fairfax Drive
        Arlington, VA 22226

      Please remember to include the addressee's name and room number when
      using the Virginia address.

      For more information, please contact Ed Barrese, Assistant Director in
      the Division of Administration, on (202) 942-3872.
