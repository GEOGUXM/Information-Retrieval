    NBL is the Federal Certifying Authority for nuclear reference materials.
    This responsibility was transferred to NBL from the Department of
    Commerce/National Bureau of Standards in 1987. NBL prepares or oversees
    preparation of, certifies for chemical and/or isotopic composition, and
    distributes nuclear reference materials--traceable to a nationally accepted,
    internationally compatible reference base--to calibrate and standardize
    nuclear material measurements. The Laboratory is responsible for maintaining
    the measurement reference base for nuclear materials and currently provides
    more than 50 Certified Reference Materials for use by the international
    nuclear community. These reference materials are compatible with, or serve
    as, international standards used by nuclear facilities and safeguards
    authorities around the world for calibration of systems used for measurement
    of the full spectrum of nuclear materials ranging from product to
    environmental or waste materials.
