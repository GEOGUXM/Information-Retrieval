Query Options

   Wild Cards - CCSO phonebook servers accept the usual Unix shell wild
   cards in queries. For example:
     * franklin roosev*
     * sm[iy]th
     * sm?th

   field=value - can be used to narrow searches. For example:
     * kub* department=comput*
     * kub* address=DCL

   However, since sites and users are largely free to modify fields, some
   trial-and-error may be needed.

   return - This gateway automatically adds return all to all queries
   except in two cases:
     * Servers known not to accept return all
     * Non-nih.gov queries of the nih.gov server are restricted to default
       query output.
