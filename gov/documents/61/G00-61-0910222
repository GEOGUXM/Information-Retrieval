   On-line Reports - Help
        __________________________________________________________________

      Inspection results are recorded electronically at a business using a
      handheld computer or are transcribed from a hardcopy inspection report.
      Inspections, whether they are uploaded from a handheld computer or
      transcribed from hardcopy, are reviewed by a supervisor and posted
      weekly to this Web Site. To locate a business and review it's
      inspections, a Business Name and/or Street Name can be supplied to the
      Business Search page.

      Business Name
      _________________

      If you want to locate a business based on the name, the letters you
      type in must match the beginning of a business name exactly. Despite
      efforts to standardize, many businesses exhibit some variation in
      naming conventions. For example, the chain of Circle K's have names
      which range from Circle K, to Circle K #123 to Circle K Store #456. If
      you were to type in "Circle K Store", only those businesses with the
      word "Store" in the name would be returned. You would be more
      successful typing in just "Circle K". This would return any business
      which begins with the letters "Circle K". Names can be typed in either
      upper or lower case or a combination without affecting results.

      Street Name
      _________________

      If you want to locate a business based on the address, the letters you
      type in must match the beginning of a street name exactly. Do not
      include Street Number or Direction, only provide the name of the
      street. If you don't know whether the street is an avenue, street or
      road, leave the extension off. To find a business on 16th Street, enter
      "16th St" in the field Street Name. Names can be typed in either upper
      or lower case or a combination without affecting results.

      Sort
      _________________

      The default Search order:
       1. Primary Sort is by Business Name in Ascending Order
       2. Secondary Sort is by City in Ascending Order

      means that all businesses that meet your Business Name and/or Street
      Name search criteria will first be sorted by Business Name in Ascending
      Order (A's before B's, etc.) and, businesses which have the same name,
      will be ordered by the city in which they are located.

      Rows Per Page
      _________________

      The Rows Per Page option controls the flow of information to your
      desktop and can be used to minimize network traffic and speed the
      presentation of the dynamically created HTML pages used to view data
      on-line. Currently this option has been fixed at 250 rows per page. In
      the event your search criteria targets more that 250 businesses, the
      Business/Permit List page will display the first 250 businesses which
      met your criteria as well as the following message:

                Your Query would have returned more than 250 rows.
                        Please Refine your Query Criteria.

      If you are interested in viewing those businesses beyond the 250 page
      limit, you will need to supply more specific information on Business
      Search to reduce the number of businesses meeting your criteria.

      Tips
      _________________

      Remember, less is best. Don't try to second guess naming conventions or
      street abbreviations.
      Spelling is everything, so we support a wild card: %.
      This means if you are looking for a business and you are not sure of
      the name, but you know the word "pizza" is somewhere in the name, then
      type:%pizza. This will return all businesses with the word "pizza"
      anywhere in the name.

      To report potential Health Code Violations, call the Department's
      Complaint Response Line to initiate an investigation. The number is
      506-6616.
