  What is FedStats?

   FedStats is the new window on the full range of official statistical
   information available to the public from the Federal Government. Use
   the Internet's powerful linking and searching capabilities to track
   economic and population trends, health care costs, aviation safety,
   foreign trade, energy use, farm production, and more. Access official
   statistics collected and published by more than 70 Federal agencies
   without having to know in advance which agency produces them.

   Note: All of the statistical information available through FedStats is
     maintained and updated solely by Federal agencies on their own web
                                  servers.

   Some principal statistical programs, such as labor force statistics and
   energy statistics, are carried out by agencies (the Bureau of Labor
   Statistics and the Energy Information Administration, respectively)
   whose sole missions are statistical. In other cases, agencies have
   statistical programs that support their program planning and evaluation
   functions.
