   Introduction:

   The Center for System Reliability has developed methodologies and
   software tools to address a wide range of reliability  problems. These
   tools and techniques have been applied in diverse application areas
   ranging from nuclear power and missile  systems to aviation,
   automotive, and manufacturing. We have the tools and the experience to
   help address reliability  problems throughout a product's life cycle.
       Design for Reliability
       We believe that reliability should be designed and built into
       products at the earliest possible stages of product development.
       As most of a product's life cycle cost has been locked in by the
       time its design is complete, designing for reliability is the most
       economically sound approach to take.
       Reliability Allocation
       Reliability allocation is the process of specifying a level of
       reliability for each subsystem or module in a system so as to
       achieve a system reliability objective. This process should be
       performed early in the design cycle to guide designers in choosing
       components, materials, and a design topology that will meet system
       objectives.
       Reliability Optimization
       It is not uncommon for a company to have 10, 20, or more
       engineering projects in progress at any one time for a given piece
       of equipment or product line. In this situation it is important to
       conduct trade-off studies to prioritize potential product
       modifications.  The best approach to this problem is to use
       optimization methods to find the combination of modifications in
       terms of the largest increase in reliability for the lowest cost.
       Reliability Prediction
       Reliability prediction involves estimating the reliability of
       equipment or products prior to their production or modification.
       The Center for System Reliability has conducted several reliability
       prediction studies for both industry and government customers
       Fault Tree Analysis
       Fault tree analysis is a logical, structured process that can help
       identify potential causes of system failure before the failures
       actually occur.  Fault trees are powerful design tools that can
       help ensure that product performance objectives are met.
