   LAPS Information Summary Website

   Purpose

   This web page has been put together to help potential LAPS users and
   provide consistent information with regard to LAPS frequently asked
   questions (FAQs). Most of this information is already available via the
   web through our README file. However, due to the increasing number if
   inquiries with regard to LAPS details, a webpage that focused on the
   FAQs from interested users was deemed appropriate. As inquiries are
   fielded by our LAPS staff, we intend to update this page as often as
   needed. This page also contains valuable links to a number of
   information sources that will help answer LAPS related questions.

   LAPS System Requirements:

   What are typical disk space requirements for input data and generated
   output?

   The current Colorado LAPS (domain size 61x61x21):
     * Typically generates approximately 380 - 400 Mbytes of data per 24
       hours.
     * We purge LAPS hourly retaining in most cases 24 hours worth of
       information.
     * Some files are maintained longer (i.e., LAPS soil moisture, .lsm
       files, are kept for 48 hours).
     * This requirement scales upward or downward depending on domain
       size.
     * A typical file (one time's output for one 3-d field) consumes
       316892 bytes

   How much machine memory does LAPS need?
     * The current version of LAPS requires approximately 256 Mbytes of
       RAM, primarily for its satellite interface
     * If you don't run LAPS with satellite data, less than 128 Mbytes of
       RAM are required.
     * We are working on a future release that will enable it to run with
       satellite data, and require less than 128 Mbytes of RAM.

   Data specific information:

   What data formats are used in LAPS?

   NetCDF or ASCII data are used for output and most internal data
   storage. This way all data files are machine independent.

   How does LAPS interface to my local datasets?

   Each local installation requires unique routines to access local data.
   These local routines are the responsibility of the user and are linked
   and become part of the LAPS ingest software.

   What satellite data does LAPS use?

   Currently, LAPS uses GOES image data (visible plus IR channels 3, 4,
   and 5). We plan to expand LAPS satellite capabilities in the following
   areas in this order:
     * GOES Sounder [enabled in software 4/15/97 but data interface has
       yet to be developed or tested]
     * TIROS IR sounder
     * TIROS microwave
     * DMSP sounder (microwave)

   Bosnia prototype:

   What are the data sets used in the Bosnia demonstration?

   The following datasets are used in the Bosnia prototype at AFGWC:
     * RAOBs
     * Surface data (SAOs)
     * NOGAPS forecasts (background)

   Platforms:

   What platforms has LAPS run on?
     * To date, LAPS has run on:

     * Sun (SunOS v 4.3.1)[Solaris is planned later this year]
     * IBM(AIX v 2.3) [AFGWC has this running under AIX v 4. but we have
       not yet tested this at FSL]
     * HP(HP-UX v B.10.20)

     * DEC VAX-VMS (original version, no longer supported)

     We plan to port to:
     * SGI (IRIX64 v 6.2)
     * Dec Alpha (OSF1 v 4.0)

   How much computer time is needed to run LAPS?
     * On our Sun 670 (SunOS v 4.3.1), one LAPS cycle for the Colorado
       61x61x21 domain takes roughly 10 - 15 minutes. 9.5min Avg.
       [7.294x10**-3 sec/gridpoint]
     * On our IBM 590 (AIX v 2.3), one ROC domain cycle 125x105x21 takes
       between 6 - 16 minutes. 9.3min Avg. [2.024x10**-3 sec/gridpoint]

   Misc.

   How many lines of code does LAPS contain?

   LAPS contains approximately 180,000 lines of FORTRAN and 34,000 lines
   of C code.  There are additional lines for scripts, Make files and the
   like, but this give you a rough estimate.  This figure does not include
   any model code (e.g., RAMS or MM5); this is strictly analysis code.

   Is LAPS Y2K Compliant?

   The latest information on this is can be found on our Y2K page.

   What is "newLAPS?"

   During 1997 LAPS was recast into a more user friendly configuration
   format.  This new system comes with an auto-configure feature that will
   examine your system to see what operating system you have, what
   compiler settings are required, where special libraries exist (and if
   they don't it will let you know to get them before you proceed),  and
   then it allows you to specify directory paths for different aspects of
   the system.  Data, binaries, and source code can be separated to
   different user-defined paths.  The makefiles are automatically
   configured for your system and the system builds.

   NewLAPS also contains better terrain data than Old LAPS.  (30 second
   for the entire globe)

   What software is used to visualize LAPS?

   We use AVS for most web graphics. AVS Express is used for the D3D
   component of the workstation. A plotting program using NCAR graphics is
   supplied with LAPS and is also used for some web graphics.

   What are the critical datasets for LAPS?

   Basically you need:
     * Background data generally forecasts from a large-scale forecast
       model (mandatory for upper-level output). LAPS has used the
       following forecast models to supply background information:

     * RUC
     * NGM
     * NOGAPS

     Surface data (mandatory for most upper-level output) What happens if
   data sets fail to arrive in time for inclusion in a given analysis run?

   LAPS is robust. However, given less data the analysis will be less and
   less accurate. It will run until the surface or background fields are
   not available.

   Does LAPS use 3D Var (three dimensional variational analysis
   techniques)?

   Not at this time. However, some aspects of LAPS utilize 1D var (surface
   temperature gradients from satellite data, upper level humidity
   adjustment from satellite data complete with forward model). We are
   pursuing an upgrade to 3Dvar and this is one of our current interests.

   What are the characteristics of the terrain data that LAPS comes with?

   OldLAPS terrain file covers the entire globe with:
     * 30 second resolution over most of the continental United States
     * 10 minute resolution of the rest of the world

   NewLAPS terrain covers the entire globe:
     * 30 second resolution full coverage (even Antarctica)
