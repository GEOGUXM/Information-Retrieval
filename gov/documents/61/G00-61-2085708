   HTML Version NIH Publication No: 01-4499 Report of the International
   Workshop on In Vitro Methods for Assessing Acute Systemic Toxicity
   Results of an International Workshop Organized by the Interagency
   Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods
   (ICCVAM) and the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Interagency Center
   for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM)
   National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences National Institutes
   of Health U.S. Public Health Service Department of Health and Human
   Services THE INTERAGENCY COORDINATING COMMITTEE ON THE VALIDATION OF
   ALTERNATIVE METHODS AND THE NTP INTERAGENCY CENTER FOR THE EVALUATION
   OF ALTERNATIVE TOXICOLOGICAL METHODS The Interagency Coordinating
   Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) was
   established in 1997 by the Director of the National Institute of
   Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) to implement NIEHS directives in
   Public Law 103-43. P.L. 103-43 directed NIEHS to develop and validate
   new test methods, and to establish criteria and processes for the
   validation and regulatory acceptance of toxicological testing methods.
   P. L. 106-545, the ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000, established ICCVAM
   as a permanent committee. The Committee is composed of representatives
   from 15 Federal regulatory and research agencies and programs that
   generate, use, or provide information from toxicity test methods for
   risk assessment purposes. The Committee coordinates cross-agency issues
   relating to development, validation, acceptance, and
   national/international harmonization of toxicological test methods. The
   National Toxicology Program Interagency Center for the Evaluation of
   Alternative Toxicological Methods (Center) was established in 1998 to
   provide operational support for the ICCVAM, and to carry out committee-
   related activities such as peer reviews and workshops for test methods
   of interest to Federal agencies. The Center and ICCVAM coordinate the
   scientific review of the validation status of proposed methods and
   provide recommendations regarding their usefulness to appropriate
   agencies. The NTP Center and ICCVAM seek to promote the validation and
   regulatory acceptance of toxicological test methods that will enhance
   agencies' abilities to assess risks and make decisions, and that will
   refine, reduce, and replace animal use. The ultimate goal is the
   validation and regulatory acceptance of new test methods that are more
   predictive of human and ecological effects than currently available
   methods. Additional Information Additional information can be found at
   the ICCVAM/Center Website: http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov and in the
   publication: Validation and Regulatory Acceptance of Toxicological Test

   Björn Ekwall is acknowledged for his extraordinary contributions to
   alternative test method development and his dedication to the
   implementation of alternative tests for regulatory purposes. Results
   from his work in the area of in vitro cytotoxicity served as a major
   impetus for organization of the International Workshop on In Vitro
   Methods for Assessing Acute Toxicity. Born in Uppsala in 1940, he
   attended Uppsala University Medical School and obtained his MD in 1969.
   After a short time as a General Practitioner, he became a lecturer at
   the Department of Anatomy, Uppsala University, where he earned his
   Ph.D. in toxicology. He was a postdoctoral fellow for 6 months at
   Materials Science Toxicology Laboratories, Memphis, TN, 1981-1982, and
   a Consultant at the Toxicology Laboratory of the Swedish Food
   Administration, 1982-1983. Between 1989 and 1996 he was an Associate
   Professor at the Division of Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical
   Biosciences, Björn Ekwall, 1940  2000 Uppsala University. Dr. Ekwall
   introduced the concept of testing compounds in systems such as cell
   cultures and extrapolating the results to human toxicity. He felt that
   one could break down toxicity in complex biological systems to basic
   elements that could then be analyzed by using in vitro methods. To
   advance these ideas, he founded a small non-profit research institute,
   the Cytotoxicology Laboratory, Uppsala (CTLU) in 1983. He also
   established the Scandinavian Society for Cell Toxicology whose mission
   is to gather scientists for meetings and show that chemical effects on
   cells should translate to in vivo effects. These organizations
   coordinated a large international evaluation study, the Multicenter
   Evaluation of In Vitro Cytotoxicity Tests (MEIC), that began in 1989 to
   scrutinize the relevance of in vitro cytotoxicity tests for human acute
   toxicity of chemicals, and to select batteries of in vitro assays for
   practical testing of chemicals as alternatives to animal acute toxicity
   tests. Sixty-five different test methods were employed for testing 50
   chemicals. Dr. Ekwall continued to work with the MEIC project until his
   untimely death on August 19, 2000. Dr. Ekwall published 69
   articles/book chapters on in vitro toxicology, plus 30 abstracts
   published in journals and another 30 abstracts published in conference
   proceedings. He received many international awards and was a member of
   many scientific societies and associations. xvii Acknowledgements xviii
