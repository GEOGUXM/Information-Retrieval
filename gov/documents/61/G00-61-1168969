      Statement by Speaker Hastert Regarding the Daschle Stimulus Plan

                              January 23, 2002

   (Washington D.C) House Speaker Denny Hastert issued the following
   statement today:

   "I have always said and I still believe that it is important for the
   Congress to pass an economic security plan that will put people back to
   work and help those who have lost their jobs. I am pleased that Senator
   Daschle has indicated that he may bring an economic stimulus plan to
   the Senate floor. I would hope that the Senate would finally pass a
   comprehensive economic security plan and that we could finally go to
   conference.

   "The House has passed two economic security bills that would put people
   back to work. These plans included provisions that would boost consumer
   confidence, that would spur investor confidence and that would give
   businesses incentives to create jobs. These bills also had generous
   provisions that helped the unemployed keep their health care insurance
   and extended unemployment benefits.

   "Senator Daschle has indicated that he may change course and allow the
   Senate to consider an economic security package. That is good news for
   the American people, and I would encourage the Senator to pursue this
   course."
