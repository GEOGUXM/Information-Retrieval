About the Commission and its Report

   The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (P.L. 103-359)
   created the Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the United
   States Intelligence Community. This bipartisan panel was charged with
   reviewing "the efficacy and appropriateness" of U.S. intelligence
   activities in the "post-cold war global environment" and with
   submitting a report of its findings and recommendations to the
   President and the Congress. The Commission's report, "Preparing for the
   21st Century: An Appraisal of U.S. Intelligence,"
   was released on March 1, 1996. It addresses such issues as the size and
   secrecy of the intelligence budget; the organization of U.S.
   Intelligence Community; management of the CIA; covert action; economic
   intelligence; intelligence support to policy makers and military
   operations; space reconnaissance; "right-sizing" intelligence agencies;
   and oversight of intelligence.
