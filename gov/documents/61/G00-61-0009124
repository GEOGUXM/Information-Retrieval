     Unlawful Trade Practices of Milk and Dairy Products: Enactment of SB
   1381 eliminated numerous restrictions on the promotion of the sale of
   milk and dairy products. The proposed regulations clarify aspects of SB
   1381 relating to the following issues:
     * Sampling of Milk and Dairy Products Sets perimeters that allows
       dairy manufacturers and retail stores the flexibility to provide
       samples of dairy products to the public
     * Meeting Competition; Retail Sales by Wholesale Customers Clarifies
       the meaning of "current price", meeting the same or higher price
       and "geographic area".
     * Meeting Competition; Multi-Unit Price Defines "meeting competition"
       as it pertains to units of product sold for a single price.
     * Sweepstakes Explains that the use of a sweepstake promotion must
       comply with sales below cost provisions of the Food and
       Agricultural Code and the entity conducting the promotion must
       maintain adequate records.

   as a foundation tree with the Department. The proposed action does not
   differ from any existing, comparable federal regulation or statue.

     Oriental Fruit Fly Interior Quarantine: This amendment of the
   regulation established a quarantine area of approximately 67 square
   miles surrounding the Oriental fruit fly infestation epicenter in the
   San Diego area of San Diego County. The effect of the change is to
   provide authority for the State to regulate movement of hosts of
   Oriental fruit fly from, into and within that area to prevent
   artificial spread of the fly to noninfested areas to protect
   California's agricultural industry. The proposed action does not differ
   from any existing, comparable federal regulation or statute.

     Red Imported Fire Ant Eradication Area: This amendment of Section
   3591.16(a) established Sacramento County as an eradication area for red
   imported fire ant. The effect of the amendment is to provide authority
   for the State to conduct control and eradication activities against red
   imported fire ant in Sacramento County to prevent spread of the ant to
   noninfested areas to protect California's agricultural industry and
   environment. There is no existing, comparable federal regulation or
   statute.

     Proposal to amend section 899.1 and adopt section 899.2 relating to
   inspection times at salesyards: The Department of Food and Agriculture,
   Bureau of Livestock Identification, proposes changes to Title 3,
   Division 2 of the California Code of Regulations as follows:
   Food and Agricultural Code section 21051 requires that cattle shall be
   inspected prior to release or sale from a public stockyard, public
   salesyard, or public or private cattle sales market. Existing section
   899.1 limits inspections at salesyards to 1600 hours (4:00 p.m.) each
   sale day. This proposal would amend section 899.1 to allow for a
   one-hour extension for livestock inspections due to unforeseen
   circumstances and to notify the salesyard of the delay.
   This proposal would also adopt section 899.2 to allow salesyard
   management to arrange for an inspector to stay for no more than one
   extra hour. This would allow for an inspection of these late arrivals
   so that the cattle could be sold on the scheduled sale day to prevent
   delay in marketing.
