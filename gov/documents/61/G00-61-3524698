   The National Conservation Partnership

   The National Conservation Partnership is the dynamic relationship
   between federal, state, and nonprofit groups that have pledged to
   jointly provide national conservation leadership.

   The Partnership was formalized in January 1993 when three conservation
   leaders signed a national agreement, pledging to work together for
   natural resource conservation. A fourth partner was added in 1997.

   Independently, Partnership members have separate responsibilities for
   sustaining the environment and conserving the nation's natural
   resources. As partners in conservation, they speak with a unified voice
   and act to realize a common vision: A productive nation in harmony with
   a quality environment.

   The National Conservation Partnership commitment involves:
     * Listening and responding to customers' local resource conservation
       needs;
     * Fostering economically viable environmental policies;
     * Advocating a total natural resources approach to conservation;
     * Maintaining and advocating grass roots conservation delivery
       systems.

   Partnership Members

   The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is the federal
   agency that works hand-in-hand with the American people to conserve
   natural resources on private lands. Formerly the Soil Conservation
   Service, NRCS brings 60 years of scientific and technical expertise to
   the Partnership.

   The National Association of Conservation Districts (NACD) is the
   national organization for 3,000 local conservation districts across the
   country. Conservation districts are local units of government
   responsible for the soil and water conservation work within their
   boundaries. The districts' role is to increase voluntary conservation
   practices amoung farmers, ranchers and other land users.
     * Conservation Districts

   The National Association of State Conservation Agencies (NASCA) is a
   coalition of state conservation agencies across the country. These
   agencies provide guidance and funding for conservation districts. They
   operate numerous state environmental, sediment control, and soil
   erosion prevention programs.

   The National Association of Resource Conservation and Development
   Councils (NARC&DC) provides a collective voice for more than 300 local
   Resource Conservation and Development Councils nationwide. The NARC&DC
   serves as an advocate and assists local councils to identify and take
   action on issues and opportunities to improve the quality of life and
   environment in their communities. Local RC&D Councils are grass-roots
   community leaders working collectively in behalf of conservation and
   sustainable development.

   Local Partnerships Succeed

   Together, local Partnerships have worked on many conservation issues.

   For example, the Partnership has worked together in New York state to
   develop a Whole Farm Program to protect water quality in the New York
   City watershed.

   In Santa Cruz, California, the Partnership used road stabilization
   practices and revegetation techniques to prevent erosion, landslides,
   spread of wildfire, and poor water quality.

   In Holly Grove, Arkansas, the Partnership developed a community plan to
   deal with flooding from a nearby creek.
