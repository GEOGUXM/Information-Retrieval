   PKI Interoperability

   The foundation for customer-centric, interoperable E-Gov services is
   the ability to cross-certify disparate public key infrastructure (PKI)
   domains. Cross-certification provides a trust framework wherein digital
   credentials are evaluated against a set standard, providing the
   technical and legal infrastructure necessary for Federal agencies to
   accept digital credentials issued by other federal agency's and
   non-governmental certificate authorities. Cross-certification will be
   accomplished through the Federal Bridge Certificate Authority (FBCA).

   The policies and procedures of the FBCA are governed by the Federal PKI
   Policy Authority, which has responsibility for mapping a CA's policies
   and practices against the FBCA standard. GSA is one of the six charter
   members of the Policy Authority, which also includes the Departments of
   Commerce, Defense, Justice, and Treasury and the Office of Management
   and Budget.
