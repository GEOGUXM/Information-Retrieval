   Sanders Applauds Successful Bid to Bring Campaign Finance Reform to the
                            House for a Fair Vote

     WASHINGTON Congressman Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said today that he is
   pleased with the successful bid of 218 members of Congress to bring the
     Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform legislation to the House for a
   vote. Sanders signed the discharge petition last July, in an effort to
   overrule the Republican leaderships procedural defeat of this important
      legislation. Sanders said, At a time when billions of dollars are
      flooding the political process the passage of meaningful campaign
   finance reform is critical and I am thrilled that Shays-Meehan is going
                               to be voted on.

    The Shays-Meehan Campaign Reform Act, if passed, will completely ban
   soft money contributions to the national political parties and prohibit
     federal office holders and candidates from soliciting soft money in
      connection with Federal elections. Additionally, it includes safe
     guards against soft money abuses at the state level by prohibiting
   state and local parties from directing soft money to federal candidates
     through the mention of their names in television ads paid for with
   those funds, reigning in campaign ads masquerading as issues advocacy.
     Finally, this legislation will enhance the disclosure of political
   expenditures and provide the FEC with the teeth it needs to enforce the
                                    law.

     Sanders concluded, "With eighty percent of political contributions
     coming from one-quarter of 1% of the population -- the majority of
     which are soft money contributions clearly, the current system has
     become totally out of step with the best interests of the American
     people. Meaningful campaign finance reform is needed now more than
                                   ever."
