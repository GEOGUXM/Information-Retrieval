   COMMISSION ON LOCAL GOVERNANCE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

   The Commission on Local Governance for the 21st Century was established
   by AB 1484 (Hertzberg), signed into law on October 12, 1997 as Chapter
   943, Statutes of 1997 and amended by AB 2621 (Chapter 1038, Statutes of
   1998). The Commission is comprised of 15 members, 9 of whom are
   appointed by the Governor and 3 each by the Senate and Assembly Rules
   Committees.

   The legislation required the commission to complete a study of
   potential revisions to the policies, practices, and statutes that
   govern city, county, and special district boundary changes (the local
   agency formation sections of the Government Code, also known as the
   Cortese-Knox Act). The members also examined closely related causes of
   boundary change controversies, including the need for local fiscal
   stability and its effects on regional coordination and rational land
   use decisions.

   Specifically, the legislation required the report to include each of
   the following:
     * A review of the current statutes, including, but not limited to,
       the Cortese-Knox Act, regarding the policies, criteria, procedures,
       and precedents for city, county, and special district boundary
       changes.
     * Proposals to add criteria to increase citizen and community
       participation in city, county, and special district governments.
     * Proposals to ensure conformity with the requirements of federal
       law, including, but not limited to, the federal Voting Rights Act
       of 1965 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1971).
     * Recommendations for statutory changes, if any.

   The Commission held 25 days of public hearings between August 1998 and
   January 2000, during which it heard from over 160 individuals and
   organizations. In addition, there have been over 100,000 visits to the
   Commission's website. The Commission's final report, Growth Within
   Bounds, was adopted on January 20, 2000 and may be downloaded from this
   website.
