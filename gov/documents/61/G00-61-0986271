    USGS Spectroscopy Laboratory

   Utah 1998 EPA-USGS AVIRIS Study
     __________________________________________________________________

   Imaging Spectroscopy studies of Utah include mapping of:
     * Surficial mineralogy and its relationship to ore deposits
     * Abandoned mine lands research
     * Support for 2002 Olympics
     * Vegetation studies
     * Research on specific ecosystems

   Data publication, distribution, and availability policy:

   The data are available from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, AVIRIS Data
   Facility for a fee, but will soon be available from the EPA at no cost
   for those groups participating in joint studies with the EPA (details
   to follow).

   Study Status:
     * AVIRIS data were acquired August 5, 1998 with the NASA ER2 aircraft
       at 65,000 feet. These data have a spatial resolution of about 17
       meters/pixel, and are referred to as the "high altitude" data.
     * Coverage (high altitude data) (see quick looks below):

     * Park City and Alta

     * Flight-line data: lines 1-4

     Oquirrh Mountains (includes Tooele and Stockton, UT)

     Tintic District (includes Eureka, UT)

     Tushar Mountains (includes Marysvale, UT)

     Leeds-Silver Reef Region (includes St. George, Washington, and
   Toquerville, UT)

     ER-2 high altitude color photography to be acquired with the AVIRIS
   data, and digital scanning (3.7-meter/pixel spatial resolution) will be
   done. Full resolution images will be ~45 MBytes each. (See examples
   under our Arches N.P. page.)
   NOTE: the photography has been received from NASA. The film is Color IR
   and includes only the 4 lines over Park City. The camera failed after
   line 4 and there is no coverage for the rest of the flight.

     A second AVIRIS survey was flown with a NOAA Twin Otter aircraft at a
   lower altitude (12,500 ft ASL) on October 12, 1998 over the Park City
   region. The ground spatial resolution of the low altitude data is
   approximately 2 meters/pixel. Low altitude AVIRIS data were acquired
   over these areas:
     * Along the Silver Creek drainage from Empire Canyon in the southwest
       to the Richardson
       Flats area in the northeast near the Route 40/248 interchange.
       Richardson Flats, the site of historic smelting operations and
       tailings ponds, is not covered by the flightline.
     * Along American Fork Canyon west of Heber City.

     AVIRIS calibration to surface reflectance:

   AVIRIS data from all study areas have been calibrated to reflectance
   using field spectral data acquired during the summer of 1998. The
   calibration of the Leeds/Silver Reef data is only preliminary at this
   time, as a calibration site in the area has yet to be determined.

   The following paper discusses how the data are calibrated and includes
   images and spectra of the Utah calibration sites:

   Surface Reflectance Calibration of Terrestrial Imaging Spectroscopy
   Data: A Tutorial Using AVIRIS

   Calibration Sites
     * Park City region:

     * DETAILED CALIBRATION INFORMATION AND DIGITAL CALIBRATION DATA
     * Jordanelle dam face (primary site)
       Lat: 40 deg 35.905' N
       Long:111 deg 25.565' W
     * Deer Creek dam face (secondary site)
       Lat: 40 deg 24.310' N
       Long: 111 deg 31.704' W

     Oquirrh Mtns region:
     * DETAILED CALIBRATION INFORMATION AND DIGITAL CALIBRATION DATA
     * Old Saltair salt flat:
       Lat: 40 deg 46.051' N
       Long: 112 deg 09.647' W

     Tintic District (use Old Saltair salt flat, above)

     Tushar region (Marysvale, UT):
     * Piute Resevoir State Park boat ramp parking lot.
       Lat: 38 deg 19.157 N
       Long: 112 deg 11.778 W

     Leeds-Silver Reef region (includes St. George, Washington, Pintura
   and Toquerville):
   (calibration site to be determined).

     Preliminary Tetracorder mapping has been performed on the priority
   areas from all five study sites.

     Mapping results were presented at the JPL AVIRIS workshops in 1999
   and 2000, and at the 14th International Conference on Applied Geologic
   Remote Sensing, Las Vegas, Nevada, November, 2000:

     * Mineral mapping in the Marysvale volcanic field, Utah using AVIRIS
       data
     * Preliminary materials mapping in the Park City region for the Utah
       USGS-EPA Imaging Spectroscopy Project using both high and low
       altitude AVIRIS data
     * Preliminary materials mapping in the Oquirrh Mountains region for
       the Utah EPA Project using AVIRIS data

     Field checking began during the summer of 1999 and is underway in the
   Park City, Oquirrh Mountains, and Marysvale regions.

     Seventeen new low-altitude AVIRIS flightlines were acquired in
   October, 1999 over the Oquirrh Mountains, Tintic Mountains, Tushar
   Mountains/Sevier River/Marysvale region, and the Park City region.
