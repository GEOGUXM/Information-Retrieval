                                Email to me
      I am a research assistant working with Dr.John Moult at the Center
      for Advanced Research in Biotechnology (CARB), a research center of
      National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and
      University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute (UMBI) and
      University of Maryland. Ambitiously and enthusiastically, I am
      working on homology modeling. My short term goal is to get my Ph.
      D. degree in computer modeling of protein structure. My long term
      goal is to do research on homology modeling or drug design.
      I got my MD degree in the school of medicine, Shanghai Medical
      University. I practiced medicine as a pediatrician at Peking Union
      Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). The experiences especially
      working at Neonatal Intensive Care Unit resuscitating newborn
      babies are extremely valuable for me in my life.
      My favorite sport is tennis. My favorite museums are those of arts
      and sciences. I like traveling to see different people and places.
      I like going to symphony concerts.
