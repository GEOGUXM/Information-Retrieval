                              NOAA Ship FERREL
     __________________________________________________________________

   The NOAA Ship FERREL is equipped specifically for oceanographic studies
   of coastal and inshore waters. Though the FERREL normally works a
   six-day week, she has an nine-day endurance, a range of 1,200 nautical
   miles, and a cruising speed of ten knots. Modified from a basic design
   for an off shore oil rig supply boat, she has twin screws and a
   bowthruster to improve maneuverability. Various instruments used in her
   work are prepared and deployed through the combination of a large open
   fantail, crane aft, trawl winch, an A-frame and oceanographic winch
   located midships. Based in Charleston, SC, the FERREL works on projects
   along the East and Gulf coasts throughout year. The vessel is operated
   by the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. The FERREL is named
   after Professor William Ferrel.
