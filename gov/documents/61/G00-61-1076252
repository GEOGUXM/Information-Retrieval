   Requirements
   Other Graduate School courses, courses taken at other colleges and
   universities, and work experience may be applied for credit towards a
   certificate with the permission of the advisory committee for the
   subject area. If you wish to have a particular course or work
   experience evaluated for credit, provide a written description of the
   course or the job responsibilities for consideration by the committee.
   For further information, contact the certificate counselor at (202)
   314-3320 or e-mail adrian_rias@grad.usda.gov.

   To apply for a certificate, all courses must be taken for credit and
   completed with a grade of C or above. Two-thirds of the total number of
   credits must be taken at the Graduate School. One-third may be
   considered for waiver based on courses completed at other educational
   institutions and/or specific work experience.

   For Certificates of Accomplishment requiring less than five courses to
   complete, all courses must be completed at the Graduate School.
    A. To have credit from other institutions considered, please submit:
         1. Official transcript,
         2. Course description,
         3. Name of the certificate you are working on, specific
            transcript course you want considered for waiver and specific
            Graduate School course you wish waived and
         4. A course syllabus, if available.
    B. If you wish work experience considered for course waiver, please
       submit:
         1. Resume or SF-171 and
         2. Detailed statement of exactly what work experience you wish
            considered for waiver (be specific, including job title,
            duties, years in position, why you feel it should be
            considered, etc.), and the Graduate School course you wish
            waiver. Because the Graduate School imposes no formal
            application procedures or time limitations for Completion of a
            certificate, you may simply select the courses you wish to
            take and proceed at your own pace.
