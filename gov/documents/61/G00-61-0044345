                   Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels
     __________________________________________________________________

  Final Report Transmitted November 24, 1997

   The Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels -- established by Congress
   in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 and
   appointed by President Clinton -- has transmitted its final report to
   the President, the Congress, and the Secretary of Health and Human
   Services. The seven-member Commission examined a number of issues
   associated with labeling of dietary supplements. The report completes
   the duties of the Commission as assigned in its charter of February
   1996.

   As requested, the Commission conducted a study on and is providing
   recommendations for the regulation of label claims and statements for
   dietary supplements, including the use of literature in connection with
   the sale of dietary supplements and procedures for the evaluation of
   such claims. To accomplish its task, the Commission obtained advice
   from individuals, consumer organizations, the dietary supplement
   industry, and scientific organizations through written submissions and
   a series of public meetings throughout the United States. A preliminary
   report was released for public comment in June 1997. The final report
   reflects the consideration of materials, documents, and opinions
   submitted to the Commission during its deliberations.

   The report contains the Commission's recommendations for regulations
   and provides guidance to government agencies and the dietary supplement
   industry relative to safety, label statements, health claims,
   substantiation of claims, and botanical supplements. The report
   emphasizes the need for public access to the evidence on which label
   statements are based so that consumers can make informed decisions
   about the use of dietary supplements.

   Although the Commission operated independently from any policy guidance
   from the Department of Health and Human Services, staff support was
   provided by the Department through the Office of Disease Prevention and
   Health Promotion.

   The printed report is available from the Superintendent of Documents,
   U.S. Government Printing Office, for $12.00 (shipping included). The
