The Chesapeake Bay: Geologic Product of Rising Sea Level

  Introduction

   Figure 1
   Figure 1. The Mid-Atlantic coast of the United States and the
   Chesapeake Bay (modified from Ellison and Nichols, 1975). The
   Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States and one of
   the most diverse. It covers approximately 11,400 square kilometers and
   stretches 332 kilometers from Virginia Beach, Va., to Havre de Grace,
   Md., at the mouth of the Susquehanna River (fig. 1). Its watershed
   drains a region of 165,800 square kilometers. The Chesapeake is the
   shipping artery for Norfolk, Va., and Baltimore, Md., and it is highly
   valued for its sea life, waterfowl, sport fishing, and recreational
   boating. At the same time, the bay is threatened by environmental
   degradation caused by man-induced pollution from a variety of sources.

   There is little awareness, however, that the rapidly rising relative
   sea level within the bay is also having dramatic and wide-ranging
   effects. Islands once populated in colonial time and during the past
   century have disappeared due to submergence and related shore erosion.
   The artifacts of early European settlers and prehistoric peoples are
   sometimes found by watermen working over land areas now covered by the
   shallow waters of the bay. Sharps Island, described and mapped by John
   Smith in 1608, has since disappeared, although it was shown on maps and
   charts as recently as the beginning of the 20th century. Submerged and
   eroded Sharps Island (fig. 2), formerly at the mouth of the Choptank
   estuary, is recalled only by a prominent lighthouse erected in 1882 and
   is now covered by 3- to 4-meter water depths. Expanding wetlands are
   claiming low-lying communities on Smith Island and Tangier Island.
   Settlements begun in the 18th and 19th centuries, together with their
   churches and cemeteries, are often surrounded by the rising water of
   the bay during periods of extreme high tides -- a prologue to the
   rising sea level (fig. 3).

          1848 (U.S. Coast Survey, 1848). Inset shows Sharps Island lighthouse,
          which was built in 1882 (photograph from Vojtech (1997); used with
          permission from Tidewater Publishers). The former Sharps Island is now
          submerged, and the lighthouse is surrounded by water 3 to 4 meters
          deep.

   The Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, situated on Maryland's Eastern
   Shore, is unique in its coastal marshland waterfowl habitat. The refuge
   is being widely affected as steadily rising sea level converts
   vegetated marshlands into shallow ponds and changes important
   shallow-water marsh habitat into deeper water plant and animal
   communities. In short, the bay is changing and changing rapidly, even
   in human timeframes. With the potential for climate warming in the near
   future, relative sea-level change could accelerate and bring about even
   more dramatic change for the bay in the next century.

  Sea-Level Change

 The Chesapeake Bay is the drowned, ancestral valley of the Susquehanna
 River; the bay is fed by runoff from tributaries of the Potomac,
 Patuxent, Rappahannock, and James Rivers (fig. 4). About 18,000 years
 ago, the Susquehanna riverbed extended beyond present Cape Henry and
 Cape Charles and continued to the shoreline of the Atlantic Ocean, at
 that time at the edge of the continental shelf. During the last
 glaciation, ice sheets covered most of Canada and extended southward
 into the Midwestern United States and eastward into northern New Jersey
 and along Long Island. Water, once contained in the ocean basins, fell
 as snow onto the continents, where it was stored as glacier ice.
 Worldwide sea level fell as glaciers expanded.

 At the full extent of the last glaciation, sea level was approximately
 100 meters lower than at present, and as a result continental shelves
 were exposed throughout the world. At the end of the last glacial
 epoch, sea level rose relatively rapidly as continental glaciers
 melted. By 15,000 years ago, the outer continental shelves had been
 submerged, and by 10,000 years ago, the main channel of the ancient
 Susquehanna River valley was flooded and became a narrow estuary.
 Between 6,000 and 7,000 years ago, the rate of submergence began to
 slow, and the Chesapeake Bay took on its characteristic "drowned river
 valley" shoreline pattern. Sea level at that time stood approximately 9
 meters lower than the present level. Since then, the rate of sea-level
 rise over much of the last 6,000 years has been an almost-imperceptible
 1.4 millimeters per year (about 6 inches per century). The present
 general shoreline configuration was attained by the time the first
 European and colonial maps were prepared (fig. 5), but as tide gauges
 and the continued inundation of low-lying areas indicate, relative sea
 level in the bay is still rising.

          approaching the entrance of the Chesapeake Bay.

  Relative Sea Level

   Sea-level change during the past 10,000 years has varied from place to
   place and region to region. Sea level is measured relative to datums on
   land, but the altitude of the land changes as well, due to
   imperceptible natural subsidence and uplift of the Earth's crust. If
   the land surface is subsiding at the same time that ocean volumes are
   increasing, then the rate of submergence will be greater than it would
   be due to changes in ocean volume alone. If the land area is rising
   relative to the sea, apparent sea level may fall. Human changes such as
   ground-water extraction and fluid withdrawal from petroleum reservoirs
   can induce subsidence and influence relative sea-level change.
   Monitoring altitudinal changes in the Earth's crust is a difficult
   task, although satellite measurement with global positioning systems
   promises to give more accurate results than were formerly possible. To
   complicate the picture further, changes in ocean volumes due to natural
   or man-induced climate changes can cause relatively short-term
   fluctuations in sea level, by changing the thermal expansion of the
   ocean.

  The Modern Setting

   Continuous tide gauge records around the Chesapeake Bay show that the
   rate of sea-level rise during the 20th century has not been constant
   and that modern rates are more rapid than those determined by geologic
   studies conducted two decades ago. The current rate of sea-level rise
   at the mouth of the Chesapeake is about 4 millimeters per year (about
   1.3 feet per century) and decreases northward. Tide gauges with longer
   periods of record, like that at Solomons Island, Md., midway along the
   length of the bay, record mean sea level since 1937 and illustrate a
   3-millimeter-per-year rate of rise (about 1 foot per century) (fig. 6).
   Areas described as marsh in colonial times have given way to shallow
   creeks. Dead trees farther up tributary creeks characterize areas only
   recently submerged to become marsh. Tree stumps of former forests can
   be found beneath the sediments of tributary creeks. Sea-level rise
   continues.

   Island, Md., tide gauge 193797 (National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration, written commun., 1998).                          Figure 6

  The Chesapeake Bay Today

   Tide gauges for the Chesapeake Bay and the Mid-Atlantic coast show
   rates of sea-level rise twice that of the worldwide average. Scientists
   disagree on the cause of the recent increase in the rate of rise. Is
   the increase caused by land subsidence, or is it related to a changing
   climate and ocean volume? Anthropogenic (man-induced) causes are often
   sought to account for anomalies in the short historical records of
   environmental change. Sediment compaction resulting from extraction of
   ground water is another popular explanation used today to account for
   land subsidence. On a much broader scale, a zone of subsidence along
   the entire Mid-Atlantic coast has been attributed to crustal adjustment
   still taking place following the removal of vast thicknesses of glacier
   ice to the north thousands of years ago (isostatic adjustment).

   The Chesapeake Bay has also been identified as one of four anomalous
   areas along the U.S. East Coast that appear tectonically active. A zone
   of crustal downwarping and sediment accumulation known as the Salisbury
   embayment has long been recognized beneath the Delmarva Peninsula. It
   is clearly possible for vertical movement to occur along such zones.
   Another geologic factor that might account for anomalous rates of
   sea-level change, at least for the mouth of the bay, is possible
   subsidence related to compaction of the fill of a large buried impact
   crater that underlies much of the Norfolk, Hampton Roads, and Cape
   Charles area. For the Chesapeake Bay, the rate of sea-level rise has
   certainly accelerated, but just as certainly, rising sea level is the
   norm in the region rather than the exception. The applied scientific
   issues in this area revolve around understanding, coping with, and more
   importantly, planning for an ongoing dynamic Earth process like
   sea-level change.

  The USGS Role in Sea-Level Research in the Chesapeake Bay

   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) role in sea-level research is
   national in scope and ranges from remote sensing and geologic mapping
   of wetlands to studies of coastal erosion and evidence of older
   shorelines in the geologic record. Both short- and long-term
   environmental records are taken in account. One goal is to be able to
   determine the rate of sea-level change on century to thousand-year time
   scales in order to compare consistency and agreement (or lack thereof)
   with the decadal and annual records of the tide gauges. In the
   Chesapeake Bay, the USGS is conducting research to reconstruct the
   detailed pattern of relative sea-level change during the last 6,000 to
   8,000 years. Few modern data are available from which to establish
   baselines to compare with the ongoing rate of sea-level rise. Current
   research efforts focus on the central region of the Chesapeake Bay. For
   example, coring studies of marshes and tributary creeks in the Patuxent
   River basin are providing sedimentary and biological records of rising
   sea level.

   One aspect of USGS research is to place in perspective the role of
   sea-level rise as a natural ongoing process that continues to modify
   the bay and its resources. Another aspect is to demonstrate the effects
   of sea level on past and present settlement, as well as environmental
   change. The Patuxent River was a center of 17th and 18th century
   settlement and so is a key study site from which to obtain geologic
   information that can be applied to a variety of societal and scientific
   problems. Data from sediment cores obtained to document the sea-level
   history can also furnish records of sedimentation rates, temperature
   and salinity changes, and water chemistry and can be used to measure
   human impacts on the natural systems from pre-European settlement times
   to the modern industrial world. Understanding the history of sea-level
   rise and associated changes in sedimentation and salinity will help
   resource managers better formulate and refine restoration strategies
   for the bay and its resources.
