   News Update
     __________________________________________________________________

   Commissioner Mills announced the names of the 2000-2001 members of
   NYSATL.  Members received certificates signed by both the Chancellor of
   the Board of Regents, Carl T. Hayden, and the Commissioner recognizing
   their participation in helping to raise learning standards for the
   students of New York State.

   NYSATL congratulates all the members of this year's "class" and urges
   each of you, as well as previous years' Academy members, to complete
   the Statewide Peer Review Event survey. The data collected to date
   makes a powerful statement about the value of the Statewide Peer
   Review, but we need to hear from all participants in order to get a
   true picture of how the process is impacting classrooms and students.
   In addition to completing the survey, NYSATL asks that each new Academy
   member who wishes to submit his/her validated learning experience for
   possible publication on NYSATL's website to read and follow the Web
   Guidelines. When teachers follow these guidelines, the process of
   website publication runs much smoother, thus making it possible to
   publish more learning experiences online.

   Finally, NYSATL encourages all Academy members to continue to stay
   connected to the Statewide Peer Review by promoting the process among
   your colleagues and by visiting this website often to find out about
   activities, news updates, new links, and of course, to benefit from the
   rich bank of learning experiences that is continuously being expanded.

   Again congratulations to all of you who are helping to make NYS
   learning standards "come alive" in classrooms throughout New York
   State.

   Statewide Peer Review Critical Friends Survey

   NYSATL is recruiting educators to function as critical friends for its
   annual Statewide Peer Review event that is held in March each year.
   During the Statewide Peer Review, teachers present learning experiences
   they have written to a group of reviewers who comment on the learning
   experiences, using a set of criteria.

   Reviewers include both teachers experienced in the presenting teacher's
   subject and grade level and those with other expertise (critical
   friends). At first, the third-grade teacher may worry that he/she will
   have little to contribute to the high school science teacher's review,
   or vice versa, but such concerns are quickly allayed by experience.
   Indeed, teachers whose own work seems at first far afield provide some
   of the most useful perspectives on the teachers' and student work they
   review. Diversity of teaching setting can help enormously, too:
   different schools and different districts are represented, and a mix of
   urban, suburban, and rural practitioners is included.

   NYSATL is updating its database of critical friends. New York State
   educators who are interested in serving in this capacity should
   complete the Statewide Critical Friends Survey [PDF] and fax or mail it
   to Joan Payton. The fax number is 518-473-0858 and the address is New
   York State Education Department, Office of Curriculum, Instruction and
   Assessment, 674 EBA, 89 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY 12234.

   NYSATL Informational Booklet - An Update

   An informational booklet describing the NYSATL and its Statewide Peer
   Review process is now available online. This version contains new
   information on the history and background of NYSATL, its mission,
   products and initiatives, as well as how a teacher becomes a member of
   the Academy.

   The heart of the book is the description of the Statewide Peer Review
   process itself, including Criteria for Review, roles of participants,
   roles of Recorder and Facilitator, Criteria for Review Recording form,
   Protocol, and Learning Experience Outline form. An added feature is a
   Frequently Asked Questions about Statewide Peer Review.

   Those who are familiar with the previous version of the book will
   notice that this updated version, which became effective March 2001 at
   the Statewide Peer Review event, contains revisions of the Criteria for
   Review, the Protocol, and Teacher Presentation, and the role of the
   Facilitator. These revisions ensure that there is a balance between
   what the teacher does (context) and what the students do (student work)
   so that both aspects of the Learning Experience are fully explored in
   relation to the Criteria. The previous version of the book (in effect
   from NYSATL's inception through March 2000) as well as the accompanying
   video, is available through the Department's Publication Catalog or by
   calling (518) 474-5922.

   A Statewide mailing of a hard copy version of the new book will occur
   in the Fall with the announcement of the 2001-02 members of the
   Academy.

   NYSATL February Seminar - Looking at Student Work

   At a NYSATL seminar held in February, David Allen of Harvard's Project
   Zero addressed two questions: "Why look at student work
   collaboratively?" and "How does the closer focus on student work within
   the context of the Statewide Peer Review protocol achieve a better
   understanding of the New York State learning standards?"

   In terms of the first question - - looking at student work
   collaboratively is helpful for:
     * Understanding the learning standards
     * Assessing student learning
     * Developing curriculum and assessments
     * Improving instructional practice
     * Fostering teacher learning and professional growth
     * Building a professional community of reflective practitioners
     * Communicating with students and their families

   In terms of the second question - - focusing on student work within the
   context of the Statewide peer review protocol:
     * Grounds standards and practice in the reality of the classroom and
       student performance
     * Allows participants to see a fuller continuum of teaching and
       learning
     * Engages participants more fully in the learning experience
     * Provides a richer source of evidence about the learning experience

   Research from Expert Assistance Helps Strengthen NYSATL

   Dr. Joseph McDonald, formerly of the Annenburg Institute on School
   Reform and now a professor of Teaching and Learning at New York
   University, spoke to a group of professional developers during NYSATL's
   February seminars. Dr. McDonald shared research on professional
   development, citing the following:

   Effective professional development for teachers is:
     * organized around real problems of practice;
     * content-based;
     * focused on actual student work and learning;
     * conducted in a "professional community of practice" with norms that
       acknowledge diverse expertise and encourage "critical friendship";
     * extended over time, with opportunities to incorporate new ideas
       into practice and to reflect on the results.

    Dr. McDonald applauded the efforts of NYSATL in crafting a process
   which contains elements of all these conditions. In addition to Dr.
   McDonald, other education researchers have written on effective
   professional development for teachers. For more information on this
   research, go to NYSATL Links.

   NYSATL Seminars

   In January, NYSATL faculty rolled up its sleeves to work side by side
   with some of its professional development partners in preparation for
   Statewide Peer Review 2001. Guided by Linda Headley-Walker of the Adult
   Education Staff Development Consortia and Charlotte Brummett of the
   Bilingual Education Technical Assistance Centers (BETAC), the faculty
   began to clarify issues and develop understandings of these statewide
   initiatives for adult learners and LEP/ELL students. Aileen Clifford
   and Fran Brewer, representing Models Schools, guided discussions on the
   appropriate use of instructional technology to help all learners
   achieve higher levels of performance related to the standards.

   NYSATL Orientation to Statewide Peer Review

   On November 13 and 14, 250 educators gathered at the Albany Marriott to
   participate in a hands-on "Orientation to Statewide Peer Review". These
   educators represented each of the Regional School Support Centers
   (RSSC).  Also attending were professional development networks and the
   State Education Department's School Improvement Team liaisons to the
   RSSC's. NYSATL looks forward to continuing partnerships with these
   groups to expand peer review opportunities to all teachers on a
   regional basis. For further information on regional planning, contact
   RSSC.
