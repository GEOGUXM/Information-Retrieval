   USDA ANNOUNCES $260 MILLION FOR RURAL ENERGY AND BUSINESS EFFORTS IN 24
   STATES

   $22 Million To Benefit Expansion of Electric Distribution and Business
   Ventures in Rural Minnesota

        MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., December 17, 2001--Agriculture Secretary Ann
   M. Veneman today announced over $260 million in loan and grant funds
   for 24 states to boost bioenergy production, expand rural business
   ventures and improve economic and community development.

        To illustrate the administrations support for ethanol and
   biofuels, Veneman arrived at the conference in an ethanol-powered
   automobile with Minnesota Agriculture Commissioner Gene Hugoson.
   Veneman made the announcement with Mark Kennedy, Minnesotas second
   district Congressman, who along with first district Congressman Gil
   Gutknecht, invited her to speak at the 34th Annual Minnesota
   Agri-Growth Council.

        This administration strongly supports renewable fuels such as
   ethanol and biodiesel as important parts of the nations energy plan,
   Veneman said. The funds we are announcing today will help communities
   produce alternative fuels and strengthen rural economies.

        She told the audience of farmers and agribusiness leaders that
   Minnesota will receive $22,576,400 to help increase access to business
   opportunities and improve community infrastructure. These dollars
   include: a $9.9 million guaranteed loan to the Minnesota Valley
   Electric Cooperative which will use the loan to add 63 miles of
   electric distribution to benefit 1,130 new consumers; $950, 000 in
   loans to assist in the production of ethanol and other business
   ventures; $10.5 million in loans and grants to improve 7 community
   water and waste water systems; and a $750,000 loan to support local
   efforts to provide businesses with access to much needed financing
