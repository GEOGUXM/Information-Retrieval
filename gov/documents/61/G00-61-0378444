                        Other Sources of Information

   Since the beginning of 1995, there has been explosive growth of the
   number of home pages dealing with comets. Comet Hale-Bopp has only
   increased this growth. The goal here is not to provide every possible
   link to every comet-related home page. I believe that the links given
   below are a good sampling of what is available. In some cases, I have
   linked to excellent lists of links. You should be able to find whatever
   comet page you are looking for through these links.

The Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (CBAT)

   For rapid notification of comet (and other astronomical) discoveries,
   it is always best to go to the source: CBAT. CBAT issues the IAU
   Circulars (IAUCs) and runs an on-line computer service. There is lots
   of information, free of charge, on comets and minor planets. Other
   services are provided to subscribers only, but information about the
   services can be obtained via this link. (You can also get information
   about the Minor Planet Center (MPC)). If you are a serious comet
   observer, this is your most important source of information.

The International Comet Quarterly (ICQ) and the Comet Handbook

   The archive for visual comet observations for the past 16 years has
   been the ICQ. The Comet Handbook, put out annually by the ICQ, provides
   ephemeridies for known (periodic) comets.

The JPL HORIZONS On-Line Solar System Data and Ephemeris Computation Service

   The JPL HORIZONS On-Line Solar System Data and Ephemeris Computation
   Service provides access to key solar system data and flexible
   production of highly accurate ephemerides for solar system objects
   (21000+ asteroids and comets, 63 natural satellites, 9 planets, the
   Sun).

General Stuff about Comets

   Bill Arnett, as part of his The Nine Planets, has a nice page of
   general information on comets including some images of major comets.
   There are also links to other comet pages.

Gary Kronk's Comet Page

   Gary Kronk is the author "Comets, A Descriptive Catalog" (Enslow
   Publishers, 1984). His Comet Page provides excellent background
   information on comets. There are also position plots for various
   comets. He also maintains an excellent page on meteors at the same URL.

The Astronomer

   The Astronomer is one of the best publications for the active observer.
   This monthly publication, which has been around since 1965, has now
   come to the Web. Not only are comets covered, other objects of
   observational interest to the amateur astronomer are also discussed.

The BAA Comet Section

   Also from the UK, we get the BAA Comet Section Home Page, which
   includes some excellent information on observing comets.

Comets C/1996 B2 (Hyakutake) and C/1995O1 (Hale-Bopp)

   Ron Baalke (JPL) maintains the most comprehensive set of images of
   these comets on his Comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake home page and Comet
   Hale-Bopp Home Page. Also included are links to other Hyakutake and
   Hale-Bopp pages

Chiron Information and Documentation

   Patrick Vanouplines has put together this page with useful information
   on 95P/Chiron = Asteroid 2060.

Stardust Mission

   Stardust is planning a flyby of the comet 81P/Wild 2 and collect
   cometary dust to be returned to the Earth. This page provides details
   of the mission and links to other comet related pages.

JPL's P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 Home Page

   The JPL Shoemaker-Levy Collision with Jupiter Home Page has excellent
   pictures and links to the other SL9 home pages. Of course, this impact
   story is perhaps more about Jupiter than comets...
