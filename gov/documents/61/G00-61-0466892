   Combustion has been a subject of vigorous scientific research for over
   a century. Studies of combustion are motivated by important public
   health and economic problems. Combustion processes directly cost in
   excess of $200 billion each year in the United States. Air pollution,
   produced in large part by combustion-generated particulates, contribute
   to approximately 60,000 deaths each year in the U.S. Unwanted fires
   cause approximately 5,000 deaths, 26,000 injuries and $26 billion in
   property losses in the U.S. each year. The effects of global warming
   and changes of the ozone layer pose public health and economic problems
   that are potentially enormous.

   We now know that space offers unprecedented opportunities for critical
   measurements needed to understand and resolve practical combustion
   problems. These measurements are most effective for large, steady,
   slow-moving and symmetric flames that provide good temporal and spatial
   resolution. Unfortunately, this type of flame is not observed on Earth
   because gravity causes hot flame gases to rise, leading to unsteady,
   fast-moving and distorted flames typified by campfires. These
   difficulties disappear in the microgravity environment of space. Thus,
   in much the same way that observations in space avoid the disturbances
   of the Earth's atmosphere for astronomy, observations in space avoid
   the disturbances of the Earth's gravity for combustion.
