     __________________________________________________________________

   [posters.jpg] The Office of Surface Mining has developed an educational
   poster containing text and an illustration of mining and reclamation
   under the Surface Mining Law. Using the three principal methods of
   mining -- area, contour, and mountaintop removal mining, on-the-ground
   activities are described and illustrated.

   A Teachers Resource Packet that is designed for use in Middle-school is
   also available. The packet contains ten copies of the Poster,
   Vocabulary Development (i.e., crossword puzzle and vocabulary quiz),
   Interpreting Visual Evidence work sheet, and an answer key. These
   instructional materials can be easily reproduced for student work. The
   poster and Teachers Resources Packet are available to the public at no
   cost. The Teachers Resource Packet is only available to teachers.
