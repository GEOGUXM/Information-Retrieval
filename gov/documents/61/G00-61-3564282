                   Promotion to Higher Pay Grades (Ranks)

   Compared to the military services, the Commissioned Corps promotion
   schedule is accelerated, and candidates are more likely to be promoted.
   Furthermore, general dentists usually reach the O-6 rank (Captain or
   Colonel) by the time they retire.

   Promotion eligibility to each pay gradetemporary or permanent grade,
   whichever is higheris based upon a simple equation, the sum of ones
   training plus experience. TRAINING includes 8 years of credit for
   undergraduate and dental school. Therefore, entry-level dentists who
   have just graduated receive 8 years of Training credit & 0 years of
   Experience credit. This equals promotion eligibility to the temporary
   O-3 grade. All entry-level dentists come into the PHS at the O-3 pay
   grade. EXPERIENCE includes all of one's years of practice as a dentist,
   whether in the private sector or uniformed services.

   Eligibility for promotion to the next pay grade = TRAINING +
   EXPERIENCE, in years:

   Pay Grade          Training & Experience

   O-3                      8 years

   O-4                      12 years

   O-5                      17 years

   O-6                      24 years

   Dentists with 12 to 16 years of T & E credit enter the PHS at the O-3
   temporary grade and must serve in their PHS position for six months
   before being eligible for promotion to the temporary O-4 grade.

   Dentists with 17 or more years of training and experience enter the PHS
   at the permanent O-4 pay grade and must serve in their PHS position for
   one year before being eligible for promotion to the temporary O-5 pay
   grade. Dentists entering the PHS from the private sector or military
   services may receive no more than 17 years T & E credit, regardless of
   their total number of years of training and experience.

   The promotion board meets only once each year. Thus, an officer who
   becomes eligible for promotion may need to wait several additional
   months before being considered for promotion, depending upon his or her
   call-to-duty date and the promotion boards meeting date.

   Dentists may not transfer to the PHS from other uniformed services if
   they have served more than 8 years in active-duty status, unless a
   waiver can be justified. This ensures at least twelve years of service
   to the PHS prior to retirement at twenty years total.

   The age limit for entry into the PHS is <44 years. That is, an
   individual must be called to duty prior to his or her forty-fourth
   birthday. Active-duty time in any uniformed service extends that age
   limit by the amount of active-duty time served. For example, an
   individual with 3 years of active-duty service in the Armed Forces may
   enter the PHS prior to his or her 47th birthday. Waivers may be
   available, if the individual is only slightly beyond the age limit.
