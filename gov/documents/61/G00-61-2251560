   Program Definition and Risk Reduction

      NPOESS initiated the system Program Definition and Risk Reduction
      (PDRR) with the award of two contracts in December 1999 to
        * Lockheed Martin Space Systems
        * TRW

      It encompasses system studies, system definition, and Interface Data
      Processing Segment/Communicate, Command, and Control (IDPS/C^3) segment
      demonstrations and preliminary design.

      PDRR is planned to span the period from December 1999 to March 2002. By
      this time, NPOESS will have conducted
        * System Requirements Review (SRR)
        * System Functional Review (SFR)
        * NPOESS Interim Design Review (IDR)
        * IDPS/C^3 capability demonstrations

      The option period is 1 October through December 2002. NPOESS will
      conduct a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) during this time.
