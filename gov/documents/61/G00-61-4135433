   Several studies conducted by the Institute have utilized customized
   computer based models to test parameters and explore the potential
   effects of different policy options.  The models presented here were
   all designed and programmed by Institute staff.  For more information
   about these programs, contact us at institute@wsipp.wa.gov.

                   Family Resource Wage Progression Model

   The Family Resource Wage Progression Model (FRWP) calculates federal
   tax liability, earned income tax credits, food stamp benefits, and TANF
   (welfare) grants for low-income families with earnings under 200
   percent of the federal poverty level.  The FRWP model can be used to
   examine different child care copayment rates to determine the
   affordability of child care for families leaving welfare for work.

   Higher Education Resource for Modeling Aid and Need (HERMAN)

   The Higher Education Resource for Modeling Aid and Need (HERMAN) is a
   model that displays the parent, student, and taxpayer contributions to
   the cost of higher education at various levels of income.  HERMAN
   calculates the value of the HOPE tax credit, federal Pell grant, and
   Washington States Need Grant for different categories of college
   students over a range of annual income.  HERMAN also displays the
   students total cost of attendance (COA) and expected family
   contribution (based on federal methodology) to demonstrate how the
   costs of higher education are distributed among students, parents, and
   taxpayers.

   Modeling the Impact of Federal Taxes, Subsidies, and Grants on Family
   Resources
   (Presented at the Association for Computers and the Social Sciences
   Annual Online Meeting, Year 2000)
   This paper presents two computer applications that analyze the
   complicated relationships among tax credits, transfer payments,
   subsidies, and grants. The Family Resource Wage Progression Model
   (FRWP) calculates federal tax liability, earned income tax credits,
   food stamp benefits, and TANF (welfare) grants for low-income families
   with earnings under 200 percent of the federal poverty level. The
   Higher Education Resource for Modeling Aid and Need (HERMAN) is another
   model that displays the parent, student, and taxpayer contributions to
   the cost of higher education at various levels of income. Both
   applications offer an efficient means to investigate how tax credits
   and other benefits alter the financial circumstances of working
   families.  [Mason Burley - April 2000]
