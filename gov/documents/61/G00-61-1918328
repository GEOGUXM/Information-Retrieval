               Tools for analyzing and monitoring the networks

   For distributed application to fully utilize high-speed WAN's in the
   near future, and for doing network layer congestion manipulation and
   QoS, we must know something about the network. Knowledge of current and
   maximum bandwidth, of current and minimum latency, of bottleneck, of
   burst frequency, and of congestion extent would make it possible for
   application to use the optimal TCP buffer size and the optimal number
   of parallel streams. The IP level based QoS mechanism needs further
   more information to accomplish its goal.
   Using SNMP to get information described above needs a router access
   privilege which is infeasible in certain time. Therefore, to acquire
   the information we wanted, we need a user level tool to achieve out
   goal. A reliable, ubiquitous service (NCS), similar to DNS, is
   developed and deployed to allow applications to query for these values.
   pipechar -- one basic service of the NCS daemon -- is extracted for
   general using with a sender-receiver paired tool -- netest -- to
   perform the task of network problem analysis and troubleshoot.

   Network Characterization Service
       Network characterization service daemon (NCSD) provides information
       for adaptive gateway to shape the outgoing traffic. This kind of
       QoS is a temporary solution for modern network. For long run, the
       transport and network layers' protocols need to be restructured.

   ATM driver for all BSDi (BSD/OS) / FreeBSD releases is available for
   Zeitnet ATM. It will be available for FORE and Efficient ATM NIC soon.

   Pentium based workstation and server vs others. BSD based O.S. vs
       others.
     *
       Pentium family Info. : gives you some overall performance for
       Pentium based hardware with different CPUs, motherboards, free UN*X
       and commercial UN*X platforms. It includes performance for memory
       subsystem, in cache arithmetic computation, complicated arithmetic
       computation, SMP, SCSI controller, SCSI disks, etc.
     *
       Common workstations Info. : This is similar to Pentium family
       Info., but with different hardware platforms, such as Sun, DEC,
       SGI, etc.
     *
       Hardware Info.
       more will come later!
