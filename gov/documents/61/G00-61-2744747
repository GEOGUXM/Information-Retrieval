   *   NODC Oceanographic Profile DataBase (OPDB) - search for global
   oceanographic profiles from 1890 to the present, produce station
   location charts, create datasets that can be downloaded via FTP, and
   produce parameter vs. parameter plots for selected stations.
   Parameters stored in this database include temperature, salinity,
   nutrients (e.g., nitrate, phosphate, and silicate), oxygen, and
   chlorophyll. As the NODC receives new submissions of oceanographic
   profile data types, these are processed, quality controlled, and added
   to the database.

   Tables of the codes that are used by the Oceanographic Profile Data
   Base are available.
