                         Tissue Preservation Methods

   Specimens are collected and processed to meet the requirements of each
                     investigator's individual protocol.

   The three standard methods are as follows (special requests may be
   accommodated) :
   [red ball] Fresh : Specimens can be provided in media of choice, in
   saline, or dry, either at room temperature or on wet ice. Specimens can
   be shipped overnight on the day they are resected for delivery to the
   investigator's laboratory the following morning.
   [red ball] Frozen : Specimens can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or
   frozen in cryoembedding media such as O.C.T. and stored at liquid
   nitrogen or -70Â° C temperatures. Specimens can shipped on dry-ice
   overnight as they are collected or stored for batch shipment of
   multiple specimens once they are collected. Frozen sections are also
   available.
   [red ball] Fixed : Specimens can be provided wet-fixed, as paraffin
   blocks, or as stained or unstained slides.
