GEWEX

   GEWEX is an integrated program of research, observations, and science
   activities ultimately leading to the prediction of global and regional
   climate. UNEP GRID Sioux Falls assembled databases consisting of AVHRR
   NDVI, land cover, elevation, drainage basin and population data
   extracted from databases available at the USGS EROS Data Center and
   UNEP.

North Korea

   In February 1998, at the request of United Nations Development
   Programme, UNEP/ GRID initiated a landform, land cover and crop use
   intensity mapping project to develop baseline information for assessing
   the impact of these disasters and support agricultural rehabilitation
   and food security issues.

Africa Great Lakes

   The African Great Lakes region is composed of a variety of ecosystems
   with significant biodiversity. The highlands are relatively cool with
   abundant rainfall. Forests are also dominant in the lowlands of the
   Congo-Zaire Basin, while grasslands and savannahs are most common in
   the southern and eastern highlands.

Central America

   UNEP/GRID - Sioux Falls, in cooperation with a number of agencies,
   developed a set of maps and CDs about Hurrican Mitch's landfall in
   Central America. This series of maps, "Natural Hazards in Central
   America: Consequences to People and the Environment," depicts the
   vulnerability of people and the environment to tropical storms,
   earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, fires, and tsunamis.
