   Subject: Add Great Lakes to National Marine Verification Program (NMVP)
   References: Adds the Great Lakes to the National Marine Verification
   Program (NMVP) operated by NCEP/Environmental Modeling Center (EMC)
   defined in WSOM C-75, Appendix D.

     * Marine Verification Forecast (MVF). WFOs shall issue the

   coded MVF twice a day for each operational verification site in their
   forecast area (see appendix). The forecast wind and waves in the MVF
   are for the sensors of the buoys and Coastal Marine Automated Network
   (C-MAN) stations only. The MVF shall be consistent with the Near Shore
   Forecast (NSH) and the Open Lake Forecast (GLF). The MVF may be sent up
   to 2 hours after the forecast issuance time.

   2. Small Craft Advisories Issued for Wave Heights Only.

   Do not include small craft advisories in the MVF when they are issued
   for wave heights only.
     * Data Archive. EMC shall archive Great Lakes marine

   warning, forecast, and observation data.

                                  Appendix

     * MVF Procedures. Attachment 1 gives the format for coding an

   MVF. Attachment 2 provides a sample GLF with the corresponding MVF.
   Attachment 3 contains the list of national marine verification sites
   for the Great Lakes.

   If the data from the verification site is missing (i.e. buoy/C-MAN is
   out of commission), then code the missing data in nines (see Attachment
   1). Discontinue issuing the MVF when the NSH is suspended for the
   colder months. Resume issuing the MVF in the Spring with the start of
   the NSH season.
     * Data Consolidation. EMC computes quarterly verification

   scores, which are posted to the National Marine Verification Program
   Home Page. See WSOM Chapter C-75, Appendix D for more information.

   Explanation of code used for point verification forecasts in the Marine
   Verification Forecast (MVF).

   CODE FORMAT

   [LF][LF]$$
   %%F Code for NCEP computer and delimiter for operational forecast. This
   does not change.
   nn Forecaster number. Note: comparative verification will NOT be used
   as an individual performance measure. However, once statistics become
   available, individuals should review them for self-improvement and
   knowledge.

   GL: Gale Warning

   ST: Storm Warning
   dd Wind direction in tens of degrees. If wind direction is less than
   100 degrees, place a zero in the tens digit, e.g., 07. When wind speed
   equals 100 knots or more, add 50 to wind direction, e.g., 57. Code 99
   if wind is forecast to be variable based on regional guidelines.
   ff Wind speed to nearest knot, not to nearest 5 knots as expressed in
   the area forecast. If wind speed is less than 10 knots, place a zero in
   the tens digit place, e.g., 05. For 100 knots or more, subtract 100,
   e.g., 110 knots entered as 10 and add 50 to dd. Wind speed here is
   defined as the wind speed criteria reported by the buoy/CMAN. Code
   missing wind data with nines (i.e., 9999 for missing wind speed and

   require Small Craft Advisory as a warning category (in most cases).
