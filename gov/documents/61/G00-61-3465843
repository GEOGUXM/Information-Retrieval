   GLAST - Top Menu
   The Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) is an international
   and multi-agency space mission that will study the cosmos in the energy
   range 10 keV - 300 GeV. Several successful exploratory missions in
   gamma-ray astronomy led to the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope
   (EGRET) instrument on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO).
   Launched in 1991, EGRET made the first complete survey of the sky in
   the 30 MeV - 10 GeV range. EGRET showed the high-energy gamma-ray sky
   to be surprisingly dynamic and diverse, with sources ranging from the
   sun and moon to massive black holes at large redshifts. Most of the
   gamma-ray sources detected by EGRET remain unidentified. In light of
   the discoveries with EGRET, the great potential of the next generation
   gamma-ray telescope can be appreciated.
