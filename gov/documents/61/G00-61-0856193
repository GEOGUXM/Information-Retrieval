   The 3d Mind Tools attempts to incorporate the biochemical screening and
   bioinformatic data into the process of drug discovery. These tools are
   focused on data derived from the National Cancer Institute's tumor cell
     screening of over 100,000 small molecule agents carried out by the
    Developmental Therapeutics Program. Our approach uses this screening
    data to build two dimensional maps which lend themselves biochemical
     understanding and hypothesis generation. These maps can be used for
   drug discovery and are readily expanded with other information such as
             known protein ligands and cellular gene expression.

    Please view the anti-cancer maps and the quick-start page to explore
     the tools, and other manual pages for background on the method. For
    more information on the genesis of the 3d Mind tools please visit The
                           Covell Group web page.
