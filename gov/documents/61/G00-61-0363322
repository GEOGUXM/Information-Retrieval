   mAdb Users Note: The mAdb BETA Formatted Data Retrieval Tool provides
   an easy way to import your data into BRBArrayTools. See the posting in
   the mAdb NCI/BRB's ArrayTools forum.

                               BRB ArrayTools
                 Developed by: Dr. Richard Simon & Amy Peng

   BRB ArrayTools is an integrated package for the visualization and
   statistical analysis of DNA microarray gene expression data developed
   by the Biometric Research Branch of the National Cancer Institute. It
   was developed by professional statisticians experienced in the analysis
   of microarray data and involved in the development of improved methods
   for the design and analysis of microarray based experiments. The array
   tools package utilizes an Excel front end as this makes the system
   portable and not tied to any database. The input data is assumed to be
   in the form of Excel spreadsheets describing the expression values and
   a spreadsheet providing user-specified phenotypes for the samples
   arrayed. The analytic and visualization tools are integrated into Excel
   as an add-in. The analytic and visualization tools themselves are
   developed in the powerful R statistical system, in C and Fortran
   programs and in Java applications. Visual Basic for Applications is the
   glue that integrates the components and hides the complexity of the
   analytic methods from the user. The system incorporates a variety of
   powerful analytic and visualization tools developed specifically for
   microarray data analysis.
   BRB ArrayTools is available to government users free of charge at
   http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html The web site also contains
   a message board for users to communicate with the developers and each
   other. For questions about BRB ArrayTools, contact Dr. Richard Simon
   (rsimon@nih.gov).
