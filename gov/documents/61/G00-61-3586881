   We facilitate the development of, and access to, information about
   Federal regulatory and deregulatory activities. The Center's principal
   publications are the Unified Agenda and The Regulatory Plan.

   The Center gathers and publishes information on Federal regulations and
   their effects on society. It provides this information to the
   President, Congress, agency officials, and the general public to help
   them better understand and manage the regulatory process. The Center
   was created in June 1981.
   The Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions is
   published in the spring and fall of each year. Since 1978, Federal
   agencies have been required by Executive orders to publish agendas of
   regulatory and deregulatory activities. The Regulatory Plan, which is
   published as part of the fall edition of the Agenda, identifies
   regulatory priorities and contains additional detail about the most
   important significant regulatory actions that agencies expect to take
   in the coming year.
   The Center also has established the REGINFO.GOV site to assist users
   who want to find information about government regulation.
