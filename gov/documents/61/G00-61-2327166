   CSEAT Feedback





     Welcome to CSRC
     The Computer Security Expert Assist Team (CSEAT) was established at the
     National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to improve
     federal Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) planning and
     implementation efforts by assisting governmental entities in improving
     the security of their information and cyber assets. The CSEAT
     accomplishes this by performing a review of an agency's computer
     security program. The review is based upon a combination of proven
     techniques and best practices and results in an action plan that
     provides a federal agency with a business case-based roadmap to
     cost-effectively enhance the protection of their information system
     assets.

     Each agency must implement and maintain an active information
     technology security program that adequately secures agency information
     assets. An agency's IT security program must:
      1. Assure that systems and applications operate effectively and
         provide appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and availability;
         and
      2. Protect information commensurate with the level of risk and
         magnitude of harm resulting from the information's loss, misuse,
         unauthorized access, or modification.

     The CSEAT has three primary purposes:
      1. To assist agencies in improving the security of federal IT systems,
      2. To help reduce disruption of critical federal systems/services, and
      3. To improve federal agency CIP planning and implementation efforts.

     The CSEAT also helps Federal agencies understand how to protect
     information systems, identify and fix existing vulnerabilities, and
     prepare for future security threats. The CSEAT also facilitates
     exchange of best security practices among government agencies and
     between the government and private sector.

     The initial CSEAT approach is comprised of the following two types of
     reviews:
      1. Reviewing agency automated information security programs (computer
         security for the organization) as requested by a Federal agency,
         and
      2. Reviewing existing and planned high-risk IT systems as requested by
         OMB and a Federal agency.

     Both of these types of reviews are instrumental in identifying agencies
     computer security needs. Once these needs are identified, the CSEAT can
     develop best practices and guidelines relevant to existing federal
     computer security needs.

     A summary MS Excel spreadsheet for the CSEAT review criteria is
     available for download.

     Agencies may request a review by the CSEAT via the email address
     cseat@nist.gov. The CSEAT expects that agencies requesting assistance
     are prepared, willing, and able to act on the review recommendations.
     Agencies being reviewed will need to provide a liaison knowledgeable
     about computer security and systems included in the review to work with
     the CSEAT and collect and organize information for the CSEAT.

     CSEAT requests for reviews will be prioritized as follows:
       * Emergency requests
       * CIAO Matrix identified critical systems
       * OMB identified high impact systems
       * Systems having a significant impact
       * Time required to complete
       * Resulting high leverage across agencies
