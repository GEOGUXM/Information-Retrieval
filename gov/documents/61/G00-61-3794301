    Models of Educational Service Delivery for the Washington School for
                                  the Deaf

       _______________________________________________________________

   Deaf and hard of hearing children have attended the Washington School
   for the Deaf (WSD) since 1886.  WSD serves students from all regions of
   the state through its educational, residential, and outreach programs.
   During the 20002001 school year, WSD enrolled 138 students and provided
   support to more than 100 teachers, families, and students in local
   schools.  Approximately two-thirds of WSD students live on campus.

   Historically, most deaf and hard of hearing students in the United
   States attended separate state schools.  Since the 1970s, following the
   passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),
   increasing proportions of deaf and hard of hearing students have
   attended local public schools.  Enrollment trends in Washington
   Statewhere more than 90 percent of deaf and hard of hearing students
   are now educated in local schoolsreflect nationwide developments.
   However, most states continue to operate residential schools for the
   deaf as part of a continuum of services and educational placements.

   The WSD has requested more than $20 million in capital funds to rebuild
   major portions of the aging Vancouver campus, as the school plans to
   increase on-site capacity and expand outreach services.

   The 2001 Legislature directed the Washington State Institute for Public
   Policy (Institute) to examine educational delivery models for providing
   services and education for students through the Washington State School
   for the Deaf.


   The study will address the following research questions:
     * What educational services are provided for deaf and hard of hearing
       students at the WSD and in local public schools?  What services are
       provided on a regional basis through Educational Service Districts
       or other cooperatives?
     * How do student characteristics and educational settings compare
       between the WSD and local schools?
     * What does the research literature show about the effectiveness of
       various educational placements and modes of communication?
     * What factors has research shown to be important to consider in
       determining the most appropriate educational placement for deaf and
       hard of hearing students?
     * What is the role of schools for the deaf in other states?
     * How do different models of educational service delivery compare?

   The study is to be completed by September 30, 2002, and done in
   conjunction with a capital facilities planning study conducted by the
   Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee.
