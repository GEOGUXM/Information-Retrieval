   Estuarine Bathymetry
     __________________________________________________________________

   Introduction

   CapeCod3d.gif (35893 bytes) The National Ocean Services (NOS)
   Estuarine Bathymetry is a digital raster compilation of NOS
   hydrographic survey data for selected U.S. estuaries. These data
   provide an important piece of the mapping puzzle to those managing our
   Nations valuable estuarine resources. Although bathymetric data are
   most commonly used to create nautical charts, they are a crucial
   component in many fields of marine research, and a useful enhancement
   for 2D and 3D mapping.

   The 70 estuarine bathymetry data setsr are available in both 30 meter
   and 3 arc second resolutions. The gridded bathymetry are an
   interpolated data set representing the most up-to-date depth sounding
   information that was available at the time of publication (1998). In a
   few cases the most up-to-date information was surveyed more than a
   century ago. Although the original data are the same source data used
   to create Nautical Charts, these data sets should not be used for
   navigation.

   In addition to the data itself, a number of supporting files are also
   included on this site and within the compressed download files. These
   files are intended to help the user understand the possible uses of the
   data, and how the data sets were created. The downloadable files on
   this site can take a long time to download, and may take up
   considerable amounts of disk space. Please see the "Available Estuarine
   Bathymetry " section of this page for assistance with large files and
   downloading.

   Description:

   Estuarine Bathymetry was developed by the Special Projects Office of
   the National Ocean Service (NOS) as part of a project to produce
   readily available bathymetry. Seventy of the approximately 130
   estuaries within the conterminous U.S. are available from this site.
   These estuaries represent some of the Nations most important
   estuaries. Those estuaries which are not included, were those that had
   less than 80% coverage of digital sounding data needed to support
   detailed bathymetric processing.

   Bathymetric data are best known as navigational tools. However, on its
   own, or in conjunction with other geographic data, bathymetric data
   adds another dimension to geographic mapping and modeling and can be
   used either as a background layer or as a 3D surface for draping
   thematic maps such as benthic habitats, marine organism habitats or
   geologic data. Bathymetric data are a critical component for
   hydrodynamic models and serve as the lower boundary of the water column
   for computing water circulation and movement. These models are
   necessary to understand or predict movement of oil and hazardous
   materials, temperature and salinity distributions, migration of
   animals, and modeling storm surge and tsunami effects, to name a few.

   The bathymetry data sets offered here are a digital gridded depth data
   product offered in the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) format in both 30
   meter, and 3 arc second resolutions, derived from source soundings
   collected by NOS Hydrographic Surveys Division. The extent of the
   bathymetry data for each estuary are defined by the water boundary
   component of the NOS Coastal Assessment Frameworks, Estuarine Drainage
   Area. Elevations do not extend beyond the high water line.

   hydrosurvey.gif (36528 bytes) Source hydrographic surveys are soundings
   collected by NOS over the last 150 years, (these data are housed in the
   national archives of the National Geophysical Data Center, Boulder,
   CO). Bathymetric elevations are referenced to the local tidal datum,
   typically Mean Lowest Low Water (MLLW) averaged over a 19 year tidal
   epoch.

   In addition to the bathymetric DEM data found on this site, supporting
   information is also included with each compressed file. These include
   views depicting the coverage of the original and interpolated
   soundings, graphical indexes which show the outlines of the DEM files
   contained in the compressed file sets, information on the content and
   use of the files, and metadata.

   Background:

   The source depth soundings for this project were obtained from the
   Hydrographic Surveys Division of NOS. These surveys represent data
   collected from the 1840s to present day. The principle objective of
   hydrographic surveys is to obtain basic data for the compilation of
   nautical charts with emphasis on features that may effect safe
   navigation. Nautical charts include information beyond depth soundings,
   such as rocks, hazards, and maintained channels, and are updated
   regularly. Although the bathymetric data offered on this site are
   derived from the same original data sets as NOAA's Nautical Charts,
   these data have not been put through the same selection process that
   the nautical charting requires. Therefore, this data should not be used
   for navigation. Please see the Hydrographic Surveys product page, for
   more information on the source data.

   Because the source data are simply a sampling of points representing
   depth values for specific locations, the raw data are not immediately
   useful without interpolation. The estuarine bathymetry was derived
   using a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) interpolation process.
   Original data were combined with shoreline data points attributed with
   mean high water elevations. These composite data files were
   interpolated using a linear TIN process.

   A filter of 30 meters was applied to the resulting TIN file to find the
   closest data values to the center of the each of the 30 meter cells.
   The resulting files are 30 meter digital grids, UTM projected units
   containing position, and depth information for each grid cell. A second
   grid filter of 3 arc seconds per grid was then applied to the 30 meter
   grid file to find average data values within each of the 3 arc second
   grids. Center point values from the 3 arc second grids were exported,
   re-combined with shoreline data points, projected to a Geographic
   coordinate system, and re-triangulated to create the 3 arc second DEM
   file. 3 arc second grids are rectangular and vary in size depending on
   latitude. 3 arc second grids in Florida are approximately 90m(h) x
   81m(w), while they are approximately 90m(h) x 71m(w) in Maine.

   These files were then converted to DEM format and split into 7.5 minute
   (for 30m DEMs) or 1 degree (for 3 arc second DEMs) sections. For those
   interested in large portions of estuaries, or entire estuaries, "BIG",
   non standard, DEMs for each resolution are also provided. These "Big"
   DEMs contain all the information in one tile where extents are that of
   the estuary. It should be noted that these files, when uncompressed,
   can be more than 100Mb in size. For a more complete description of the
   data, see the metadata files for Estuarine Bathymetry.

   Present Status:

   At this time, the Special Projects Office does not plan to produce any
   additional estuarine bathymetry. However, in the event that other
   organizations make data available, which meet the processing criteria
   set for this project, every effort will be made to offer it on this
   site.

   Available Estuarine Bathymetry Products:

   Five individual product types are immediately available this site for
   70 selected estuaries:

     * 30m and 3 arc second DEM Bathymetry data sets
     * Sounding Capture Images
     * DEM Index Maps
     * Metadata
     * Supporting information

   Many of the estuaries included on this site, cover large geographic
   areas. The resulting DEM file sizes for some of these estuaries are
   very large. To speed downloading, the files have been compressed to
   approximately one tenth their original size, and put into archive files
   for each estuary. Most of these archives are less than a megabyte.
   However, some of the larger estuary archives can be greater than 10Mb.
   See the Bathymetry File Size Chart for specific file sizes.

   The compressed data files contain all the supporting information that
   is viewable from the data pages, as well as some additional text
   information. Five types of compressed files are available.

   They are:

     Standard format, tiled DEMs for 30m gridded bathymetry [eda_D30.zip]

     Standard format, tiled DEMs for 3 arc second [90m] gridded
     bathymetry [eda_D90.zip]

     A single BIG DEM for 30m gridded bathymetry [eda_B30.zip]

     A single BIG DEM for 3 arc second gridded [90m] bathymetry
     [eda_B90.zip]

     An image(s) showing the original soundings over nautical chart(s)
     [eda_SC.zip]

   "EDA" is a unique four character Code assigned by NOAA's Coastal
   Assessment Framework (CAF) to each estuary. The first character of this
   code is a letter: N, North Atlantic; M, Mid Atlantic; S, South
   Atlantic; G, Gulf of Mexico; L, Great Lakes; and P, Pacific. The
   remaining three characters are digits assigned in increasing clockwise
   order from Maine to Washington.

   Data files (#s 1-4 on list) are available in standard USGS format (#s
   1 &2), split into separate data tiles depending on the spatial coverage
   of the estuary. They are also available in a non-standard "Big" format
   (#s 3 & 4). Standard DEMs are tiled so that their footprints
   correspond to standard USGS quadrangle boundaries; either 7.5 minute
   size for 30m grids, or 1 degree size for 3 arc second grids. The "Big"
   DEM files cover all the data for a selected estuary in a single DEM
   file, rather than in a number of separate DEM files. These "Big" files
   are limited to the spatial extent of the estuary. The standard DEM
   files complete the tile space around the extents of the estuary with
   null values. For 3 arc second DEM files, this space can be a
   considerable.

   In cases where an estuary is located within a single 1 degree area, the
   3 arc second standard DEMs and the BIG 3 arc second DEM will contain
   the same data. However, the BIG DEM will only cover the extent of the
   actual data, while the standard DEM will fill in null values for all
   the blank space beyond the extents of the estuary to fill the 1 degree
   space. Thus, a BIG DEM file may have a smaller file size. In these
   cases, if your software is able to use them, we recommend downloading
   the BIG DEM file. Please see the annotated example for more details on
   downloading DEM files.

   A separate archive file for each estuary [eda_SC.zip] contains visual
   GIF images showing the locations of soundings used to generate these
   bathymetric products superimposed on NOAA Nautical chart backgrounds.
   The annotated example shows a reduced size example of a Sounding
   Capture image.

   The DEM Index file allows the user to view the geographic location of
   each of the files contained in either of the "standard" DEM zipped data
   files. This image is available from each data page and is included with
   the compressed file.

   Metadata
   and supporting information are also available from this site. There is
   a separate metadata file for 3 arc second and for 30 meter bathymetry.
   The supporting information is on the page in the form of graphics and
   special notes, and also included within the compressed files.
