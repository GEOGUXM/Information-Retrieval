                                 MARS ROCKS!

   Mars: A Rocky Planet Like Earth

   Mars is the fourth planet from the sun, and the last rocky planet
   before encountering the gas planets in the outer solar system. Only
   Earth and Mars lie in the "Goldilocks" zone, where it is neither too
   hot nor too cold for life as we know it to exist. While we don't yet
   know if Mars ever developed life, this rocky world is the only other
   planet where it is even possible for humans to walk around and explore
   . . . and maybe even live one day in the far future.

   Mars Rocks: The Stories They Tell

   When we walk around on our own planet, we don't usually pay too much
   attention to the rocks around us, but if we did, they'd be able to tell
   us all kinds of stories about how the Earth has developed and changed
   throughout its history.

   Planetary geologists are scientists who spend a lot of time studying
   rocks to learn about the stories they tell. For instance, a rock's
   structure and the materials it's made of can tell us about conditions
   on a planet when the rocks were formed. Some rocks are only formed in
   the presence of water, so finding these rocks on Mars can be extremely
   exciting--where there was water, there may have been life. And even if
   no life ever developed, the history of water on Mars--and where it
   went--will help us understand conditions and climate changes on Earth.

   Mars Rocks! Music for the Red Planet
   Mars inspires many of today's musicians. If you can think of other Mars
   references in the music you listen to, please let us know.

     * In the seventies during the time of the Viking missions to Mars,
       David Bowie wrote a song called "Life on Mars."
     * Britney Spears features the Martian terrain in her music video,
       "Oops! I Did It Again."
     * Vangelis, who wrote the music for the film Chariots of Fire, is now
       writing music inspired by the 2001 Mars Odyssey mission.
     * The UK band Blur has written a song about Mars that might be the
       first music broadcast from the Red Planet in 2003 from the European
       Space Agency's Beagle 2 lander, part of the Mars Express mission.
     * The Transfixions have also written a song called Ares4, which tells
       of the day when humans might one day go to Mars.
