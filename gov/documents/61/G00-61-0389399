   The Dryland Ecosystems and Desertification Control Program Activity
   Center of the United Nations Environment Program, Sandia National
   Laboratories, and the City of Albuquerque are jointly sponsoring a
   workshop on the topic of improving science and technology applications
   to environmental security issues with an emphasis on conflict avoidance
   in the dryland regions of the world. The potential impacts of this
   program are multifaceted ranging from political, through economic,
   environmental, energy, and human health issues. The suite of problems
   confronting the international community require new initiatives to be
   able to provide viable solutions within a sustainable development
   context. In this regard, there is great potential for practical
   results, including a plan of action with specific projects for
   submission to appropriate funding institutions. There is a wealth of
   scientific and technological expertise which could be integrated into
   intergovernmental discussions on dryland sustainability and
   environmental security. UNEP, Sandia, and the City of Albuquerque are
   interested in all opportunities to promote the application of improved
   science and conflict avoidance within the drylands. The intent of this
   Workshop is to identify and develop those opportunities.
