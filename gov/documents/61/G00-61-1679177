   White rot fungi produce unique extracellular oxidative enzymes that
   degrade lignin, as well as related compounds found in explosive
   contaminated materials, pesticides, and toxic wastes. To elucidate the
   genetic basis of this technologically important behavior, we have
   sequenced the thirty million base-pair genome of the white rot fungus
   Phanerochaete chrysosporium to high draft using a whole genome shotgun
   method. This is the first basidiomycete genome to be sequenced.
   Lignin plays a key role in the carbon cycle as the most abundant
   aromatic compound in nature, providing the protective matrix
   surrounding the cellulose microfibrils of plant cell walls. This
   amorphous and insoluble polymer lacks stereoregularity and, in contrast
   to cellulose and hemicellulose, it is not susceptible to hydrolytic
   attack. Although lignin is a formidable substrate, its degradation by
   certain fungi was recognized and described nearly 125 years ago.
   Collectively referred to as white rot fungi (since they degrade brown
   lignin, and leave behind white cellulose), these are the only microbes
   capable of efficient depolymerization and mineralization of lignin. All
   are basidiomycetes, a fungal group that includes both edible mushrooms
   as well as plant pathogens such as smuts and rust.
   Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been the most intensively studied white
   rot fungus. White rot fungi secrete an array of peroxidases and
   oxidases that act non-specifically via the generation of lignin free
   radicals, which then undergo spontaneous cleavage reactions. The
   non-specific nature and exceptional oxidation potential of the enzymes
   has attracted considerable interest for application in bioprocesses
   such as organopollutant degradation and fiber bleaching.
   Phanerochaete chrysosporium has several features that might make it
   very useful. First, unlike some white rot fungi, it leave the cellulose
   of the wood virtually untouched. Second, it has a very high optimum
   temperature (about 40 C), which means it can grow on wood chips in
   compost piles, which attain a very high temperature. These
   characteristics point to some possible roles in biotechnology.
