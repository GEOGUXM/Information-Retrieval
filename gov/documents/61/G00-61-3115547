  People

         Most people are aware that there are annual increases in Social
         Security benefits to offset the effects of inflation on fixed incomes.
         These increases, now known as Cost of Living Allowances (COLAs), are
         such an accepted feature of the program that it is difficult to imagine
         a time when there were no COLAs. In 1972 legislation the law was
         changed to provide, beginning in 1975, for automatic annual
         cost-of-living allowances (i.e., COLAs) based on the annual increase in
         consumer prices. No longer do beneficiaries have to await a special act
         of Congress to receive a benefit increase and no longer does inflation
         drain value from Social Security benefits.
