   ELECTRONIC READING ROOM

   The Office of Administrative Law Judges' Law Library on the World Wide
   Web
   is its electronic reading room. The Law Library contains Judges'
   Benchbooks, digests, newsletters, and other electronic research
   materials. It also contains case directories for frequently cited
   decisions, including administrative-adjudicative decisions rendered by
   the Administrative Review Board and by administrative law judges.

   The OALJ Archive is a repository of all administrative law judge
   decisions that are available in WordPerfect or Word format. The archive
   can be accessed both through a full-text search engine, and directory
   browsing.

   MAKING A FOIA REQUEST

   Like all federal agencies, the Department of Labor (DOL) is required
   under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to disclose records
   requested in writing by any person. However, agencies may withhold
   information pursuant to nine exemptions and three exclusions contained
   in the statute. The FOIA applies only to federal agencies and does not
   create a right of access to records held by Congress, the courts, or by
   state or local government agencies.

   FOIA requests to the Office of Administrative Law Judges, U.S.
   Department of Labor, must be in writing, and should be mailed or faxed
   to:

          US Department of Labor
          Office of Administrative Law Judges
          FOIA Disclosure Officer
          800 K St, NW - Suite 400N
          Washington, DC 20001-8002

          FAX: (202) 693-7365

   Guidelines for making FOIA request are found in the U.S. Department of
   Labor, The Freedom of Information Act Guide [Note: this link takes you
