   [bluetri.gif] James Taylor Collection
   James Taylor The James Taylor Collection comprises some of the
   Library's more important historical materials. Because of their unique
   or historically significant nature and/or their relatively frail
   physical condition, these materials are maintained under secure,
   limited-access, climate-controlled conditions, in the Library's James
   Taylor Room.
   Additional historical holdings are housed in the George Meany Memorial
   Archives through an interagency agreement between the Archives and the
   Department of Labor. Arrangements can be made through the DOL Library
   reference staff to use these materials on the DOL Library premises.

   [bluetri.gif] Folio Collection
   Flint Auto Worker The Department of Labor Folio Collection consists
   primarily of trade union serials, both domestic and foreign which date
   back, in some cases, to the early 1890's.

   The folios encompass a wide variety of items including newspapers,
   periodicals and statistical summaries which describe and depict the
   rise of the labor movement in this country and abroad. This collection
   of rare and valuable materials consists of some 750 titles.

   Due to the fragile condition and importance of the material in the
   Folio Collection it is housed separately from the main library and is
   available for researchers by appointment only.

   [bluetri.gif] Lewis Wickes Hine Photographs
   Photograph From 1908 to 1912, Hine took his camera across America to
   photograph children as young as three years old working for long hours,
   often under dangerous conditions, in factories, mines, and fields. Hine
   was an immensely talented photographer who viewed his young subjects
   with the eye of a humanitarian.

   [bluetri.gif] Portraits of the Secretaries of Labor

   Portrait of Reich The Department of Labor showcases a unique collection
   of original paintings of past Secretaries throughout the library.

   The latest addition to the collection is a portrait of Robert B. Reich
   (1993-1997). It is the custom to have the portrait painted after the
   Secretary leaves office.
