     Neutron-capturing metal alloy research improves safe nuclear fuel
   storage and disposal
   by Carol Lavery


              This is a good example of R&D and Operations Integration  the
      operations need safe storage for spent nuclear fuel at INEEL and across
     the DOE Complex  coupled with metallurgical research (R&D) to create a
             gadolinium alloy that will improve the safety of long-term spent
                                                       nuclear fuel storage.

   Metal alloys developed through a U.S. Department of Energy
   metallurgical research collaboration will offer unique solutions to
   crucial long-term DOE spent nuclear fuel disposal problems.

   Two DOE labs and a leading university materials science department are
   collaborating to find an affordable and practical solution to safely
   store spent nuclear fuel over long periods in a repository.

   Working with scientists from the Idaho National Engineering and
   Environmental Laboratory, Lehigh University, and Sandia National
   Laboratory, the National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program is developing the
   gadolinium alloy to fabricate the internal baskets of the standardized
   DOE spent nuclear fuel canister.

   The INEEL is the DOE complexwide lead laboratory for the National Spent
   Nuclear Fuel Program, which finds solutions for safe interim and
   long-term spent nuclear fuel transport and storage. (Spent fuel is that
   which has been permanently withdrawn from a nuclear reactor following
   irradiation. Its constituents have not been separated by reprocessing.)

   While DOE-managed spent nuclear fuel is only a fraction of the total
   spent nuclear fuel destined for disposal in a geologic repository,
   preparing it for disposal presents a significant design challenge
   compared to commercial fuel. Thats because more than 250 types of DOE
   fuels are used in research and production reactors with varying
   geometries, fissile content and structural characteristics.

   Safe long-term storage and disposal of DOE-managed spent nuclear fuel
   requires a corrosion-resistant, long-lasting structural assembly that
   absorbs neutrons emitted by the fuel and retains physical support and
   separation around the various fuel contents.

   Principal investigators the INEELs Ronald Mizia, Lehigh Universitys
   John DuPont (winner of the Year 2000 Presidential Early Career Award
   for Scientists and Engineers), and Sandias Charles Robino say
   gadolinium can be alloyed with nickel, chromium and molybdenum to
   create the corrosion-resistant, long-lasting, reasonably priced,
   weldable alloy.

   The process uses conventional ingot metallurgical techniques to refine
   and process the alloy.

   The scientists say the gadolinium alloy is expected to provide good
   structural support for fuel assemblies in canisters for safer storage,
   transport and long-term placement in a repository.
