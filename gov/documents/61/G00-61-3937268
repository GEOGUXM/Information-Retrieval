     The Building and Fire Research Laboratory studies building
     materials; computer-integrated construction practices; fire science
     and fire safety engineering; and structural, mechanical, and
     environmental engineering. Products of the laboratory's research
     include measurements and test methods, performance criteria, and
     technical data that supports innovations by industry and are
     incorporated into building and fire standards and codes.

  BFRL Mission
