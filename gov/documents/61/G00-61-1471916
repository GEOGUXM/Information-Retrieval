        Information Center (NWHIC), a service of the Office on Women's
        Health in the Department of Health and Human Services. The NWHIC
        provides a gateway to the vast array of Federal and other women's
        health information resources. Our site on the World Wide Web can
        help you link to, read, and download a wide variety of women's
        health-related material developed by the Department of Health and
        Human Services, other Federal agencies, and private sector
        resources.

        Don't forget to let us know what you think of the NWHIC. Let us know
        how we can work better for you. After all, this  national resource
        was designed to help ensure a healthier future for all American
        women. Wanda Jones, Dr.P.H. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health

               About the National Women's Health Information Center

        The National Women's Health Information Center (NWHIC) is the Office
        on Women's Health's clearinghouse for women's health information.
        Through a comprehensive web site and toll-free call center, NWHIC
        serves the entire United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
        Islands. NWHIC phone lines (available in English and Spanish) are
        open Monday through Friday from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm, eastern time.
        Deaf and hearing impaired callers with TTY equipment may call

        Our Slogan: "The Resource You Can Trust"

        Our Mission: NWHIC's mission is to provide current, reliable,
        commercial and cost-free, health information to women and their
        families.

   Meeting Callers' Needs:

        Fifty-four percent of calls to the NWHIC's toll-free Information and
        Referral service are from the general public. Ten percent of calls
        are from patients and eleven percent are from health care
        professionals or health care educators. Five percent of callers are
        students, researchers, writers and teaching professionals.

        Health Information today is constantly changing and is often
        confusing or contradictory. When the media publicizes NWHIC on
        television or in print, calls increase substantially, illustrating
        that many women have concerns about their health and want a reliable
        source of information.

        What Callers Want to Know:

        Though the topics often change in response to health news or
        initiatives, NWHIC's most consistent top health topics are:
        * Pregnancy
        * Breast Cancer
        * Eating Disorders
        * Heart Disease
        * Nutrition, Exercise and Diet
        * Mammography
        * Cancers in Women
        * Menopause and Hormone Replacement Therapy
        * Osteoporosis
        * Contraception/gynecology
        * Older women's issues
        * Sexually Transmitted Diseases
