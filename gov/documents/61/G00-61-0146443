   2000 STAR Results

      The 2000 Stanford 9 and STAR augmentation results for the state,
      counties, districts, and schools are final.

      California Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) program results
      for 2000 are reported at this site. Results are available for:
        * Stanford Achievement Test, Ninth Edition, Form T (Stanford 9)
        * California Content Standards tests
        * Spanish Assessment of Basic Education, Second Edition (SABE/2)

      The STAR program was authorized by Senate Bill 376 in October 1997. The
      Stanford 9 was designated for use in the STAR program by the State
      Board of Education, as required by statute, in November 1997, and was
      first administered in California in spring 1998. The Stanford 9 is a
      nationally normed multiple- choice achievement test. School districts
      are required to administer the Stanford 9 to all students in grades 2
      through 11, except for those students whose Individual Education Plans
      (IEPs) explicitly exempt them, or students whose parent or guardian
      submits a written request to exempt the student. In grades 2 through 8
      students are tested in reading, spelling, written expression, and
      mathematics. In grades 9 through 11 testing is required in reading,
      writing, mathematics, science, and history/social science. In 2000 all
      STAR testing, including the Stanford 9, occurred between March 15 and
      May 15.

      Beginning in 1999, additional test items in language arts and in
      mathematics were included as part of the STAR testing program. These
      additional items are intended to address California content standards
      that are not addressed by the Stanford 9. Also beginning in 1999,
      Spanish speaking English language learners (limited-English proficient
      or LEP) who have been in California public schools fewer than 12 months
      must be administered the SABE/2. Both the California Content Standards
      tests and the SABE/2 were administered in 2000.
