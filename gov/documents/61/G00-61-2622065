   Automatically ================================ As with most Websites,
   for site management, information is collected for statistical purposes.
   Computer software programs are used to create summary statistics, which
   are used for the purpose of assessing what pages are of most and least
   interest, determining technical, usability, and design specifications,
   and identifying system performance or problems areas. No personal
   identifiers are logged unless otherwise stated and such information
   will only be used at the client level (your Web browser) for improving
   your experience while visiting. Raw data logs are used for no other
   purposes beyond what is stated here. If you visit our site to read or
   download information, we collect and store only the following
   information for statistical uses: 1. the IP address and name of the
   domain from which you access the Internet (i.e., aol.com if you logged
   in via AOL, princeton.edu if logged in via Princeton.); 2. the date and
   time you access our site; 3. the pages you visited while here; 4. the
   Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our
   site (i.e., where you came from); 5. the Web browser version and type
   of operating system you were using Except for authorized law
   enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify
   individual users or their usage habits of these Websites. The Division
   of Payment Management does not give, sell, or transfer personal

   give, sell, or transfer personal information to third parties, unless
   required by law, such as the Freedom of Information Act. A Note About
   the DPM Website and Cookies ======================================== A
   "Cookie" is a VERY SMALL string of text only a few characters in length
   stored in a text file on your personal computer's hard disk. It is
   harmless and may only be read by the server which set it (or you). DPM
   Websites do not, as a rule, enable "cookies." One or more of the actual
   application pages present here may however use cookies, and the
   information will only contain a simple unique session identifier which
   will be of no use to, and in fact meaningless to, any other party
   beyond you and the DPM Web servers. This unique identifier contains a
   system generated session id only designed for the express purpose of
   enhancing the quality of your visit. Cookies are not IN ANY WAY used to
   track your visiting habits at the DPM Website. This information is NOT
   SAVED, TRACKED, or OTHERWISE MAINTAINED here at DPM. As a means to
   enhance your visiting pleasure, they are simply used in some instances
   to maintain the persistence of information you would provide to
   customize the behavior of these Web pages. For additional information
   specific to DPM regarding cookies and privacy information, please
   contact DPM via Info@psc.gov. Web Server Security ===================
   Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on
   this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the
   Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information
   Infrastructure Protection Act. For site security purposes and to ensure
   that this service remains available to all users, this government
   computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to
   identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or
   otherwise cause damage. For more complete information concerning this
   Privacy Statement or associated Disclaimers, please contact DPM via
