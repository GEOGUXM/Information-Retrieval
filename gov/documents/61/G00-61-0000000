     Mr. Gilleran also served as Chairman of the Conference of State

     He has also held board memberships at the University of San
     Francisco and Golden Gate University. He has received several
     humanitarian of the year awards, including the UNICEF Citizen of the
     Year award.

     Mr. Gilleran served two years in the United States Army, from 1955
     to 1957. His other governmental service includes three years on the
     California State Treasurer's Financial Advisory Committee, from 1995
     to 1998, and two years on San Francisco's Blue Ribbon Task Force on
     Efficiency and Cost, from 1994 to 1995.
