   The Biomonitoring of Environmental Status and Trends (BEST) Program is
   a National Program of the Biological Resources Division (BRD) of the
   USGS. BEST is specifically designed to focus on the response of
   biological resources to environmental contaminants. The BEST Program
   provides the conceptual framework, leadership, and national
   coordination to identify spatial and temporal trends in contaminant
   exposure and effects, reveal emerging contaminant issues affecting
   biological resources, and inform resource managers in the Department of
   Interior (DOI) of potential contaminant problems.

   The goals of the BEST Program are to:
     * measure and assess the effects of contaminants on selected species
       and habitats throughout the Nation;
     * conduct research and synthesis activities directed at providing
       innovative biomonitoring methods and tools for operational
       applications;
     * deliver effective and efficient tools to DOI bureaus for assessing
       contaminant threats to species and lands under their stewardship.

   The BEST Program is unique among national monitoring programs with its
   emphasis on characterizing the effects of environmental contaminants on
   the health of the biota and their supporting habitat. BEST accomplishes
   this  through the application of both chemical concentration
   measurements and biological responses or effects measurements.
   Contaminant effects are measured by evaluating biochemical,
   physiological, morphological, and histopathological responses of
   organisms. In addition to applying these biomonitoring methods, BEST
   assesses and synthesizes existing information, integrates with other
   monitoring efforts, and incorporates multiple lines of evidence within
   the ecological risk assessment approach.
