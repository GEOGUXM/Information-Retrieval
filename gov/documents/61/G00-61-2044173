   Under the Global Food for Education Initiative, USDA donates surplus
   U.S. agricultural commodities for use in school feeding and pre-school
   nutrition projects in developing countries. School feeding programs
   help assure that children attend and remain in school, improve
   childhood development and achievement, and thereby contribute to more
   self-reliant, productive societies. The initiative was announced by
   President Clinton on July 23, 2000, building on ideas promoted by
   Ambassador George McGovern and former Senator Bob Dole.

   In the first year pilot program for FY 2001, USDAs Commodity Credit
   Corporation is committing $300 million for U.S. commodities and
   transportation. Commodities will be donated under the authority of the
   Section 416(b) program. USDA-approved projects will be conducted
   through the UN World Food Program, private voluntary organizations, and
   eligible foreign governments.
