     Paolo Calafiura is a scientific applications programmer who works on
     the infrastructure of large high energy and nuclear physics
     applications. Currently he collaborates on the Atlas experiment at
     CERN and on CDF at FermiLab. His interests include architectures and
     frameworks, code generation, data handling, and data models. Before
     joining NERSC, Paolo was a post-doc at CERN and at the Scuola
     Normale Superiore of Pisa, where he also graduated in Physics. His
     home page is http://electra.lbl.gov/paolo.html.

     Chris Day works on the Athena Software Framework for the Atlas
     experiment under construction at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. His
     particular interests include software architecture design, data
     models for HEP events, and interactive interfaces. He is also
     working to improve the software development process of the group. He
     received his Ph.D. in HEP from Cornell in 1979 and has been working
     with object-oriented computer languages for 25 years.

     Igor Gaponenko is a computer software engineer currently working on
     the database software of the BaBar experiment at SLAC. His
     professional interests include automation of data handling at HEP
     experiments, distributed software systems, parallel programming,
     data acquisition, and real-time software. Before starting to work at
     Berkeley Lab (1998) and NERSC, Igor was responsible for the
     architecture and core software development of the data acquisition
     system for the SND (Spherical Neutral Detector) experiment at the
     VEPP-2M collider located at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics
     in Novosibirsk, Russia. Igor graduated in Physics and Computer
     Science from Novosibirsk State University in 1989.

   DRQuarrie@lbl.gov

     David Quarrie is chief software architect for the ATLAS high-energy
     physics experiment. The task is to produce and implement the
     framework or environment in which scientists will write the physics
     algorithms to do the physics they need to do as part of the ATLAS
     experiment, an international research program to be carried out at
     the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland beginning in 2005.
     David directs the development of all the off-line software for
     reconstruction, simulation, physics analysis, and the final
     real-time filter for on-line data generation and collection. He also
     works on software efforts related to the BaBar project at the
     Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Trained as a physicist, David
     earned his Ph.D. from University College London and has been
     involved in high energy physics computing since 1970. He has worked
     at Berkeley Lab since 1993.

     Craig Tull recently spent a year at CERN in Geneva to serve as a
     focal point in getting collaborators at CERN and around Europe more
     closely involved with the development of the ATLAS software
     framework, led by David Quarrie. Craig worked with these users to
     help the software project respond to their specific needs, and he
     also shared information about ongoing software development with
     other experimental groups at CERN.
