   In 1992, Congress passed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA).
   PDUFA authorized FDA to collect fees from companies that produce
   certain human drug and biological products. Any time a company wants
   the FDA to approve a new drug or biologic prior to marketing, it must
   submit an application along with a fee to support the review process.
   In addition, companies pay annual fees for each manufacturing
   establishment and for each prescription drug product marketed.
   Previously, taxpayers alone paid for product reviews through budgets
   provided by Congress. In the new program, industry provides the funding
   in exchange for FDA agreement to meet drug-review performance goals,
   which emphasize timeliness.

   PDUFA's original intent was to provide FDA with additional revenue so
   it could hire more reviewers and support staff and upgrade its
   information technology to speed up the application review process for
   human drug and biological products without compromising review quality.
   The revenues are provided by a set of three fees, with one-third of the
   total annual revenue coming from each of the following fees:
    1. Application fees for the submission of certain human drug or
       biological application (in fiscal year (FY) 2001, $309,647 per
       application with clinical data, and $154,823 per application
       without clinical data or per supplemental application with clinical
       data);
    2. Annual establishment fees paid for each establishment that
       manufactures prescription drugs or biologicals (in FY 2001,
       $145,989 per establishment); and
    3. Annual product fees assessed on certain prescription drug and
       biological products (in FY 2001, $21,892 per product).

   In the aggregate these fees are expected to generate $135 million this
   fiscal year, and increase to about $162 million in FY 2002, the last
   year of PDUFA II. No separate fees are charged for investigational new
   drug applications. However, since the review of investigational new
   drug applications is included in the definition of the process for the
   review of human drug applications, as defined in PDUFA, FDA uses some
   of the application, establishment, and product fees collected for the
   review of investigational new drug applications.

   In consultation with industry and the Congress, FDA agreed to meet a
   set of review PDUFA I goals that became more stringent each year if FDA
   also received sufficient fee resources to enable goal achievement.
   These goals applied to the review of original new human drug and
   biological applications, resubmissions of original applications, and
   supplements to approved applications. FDA met every PDUFA I performance
   goal and, to date, has met all but one PDUFA II performance goal.
   Industry also insisted on a statutory provision that fees could only be
   collected and spent each year if a large, inflation-adjusted portion of
   drug review costs would continue to be funded from appropriations
   rather than fees, so that the fees were funding additional drug review
   resources rather than replacing appropriations.

   Under PDUFA II, the review goals continue to shorten. By 2002, the
   PDUFA II goals call for FDA to review and act on 90 percent of:
    1. Standard new drug and biological product applications and efficacy
       supplements within 10 months;
    2. Priority new drug and biological product applications and efficacy
       supplements (i.e., for products providing significant therapeutic
       gains) within 6 months;
    3. Manufacturing supplements within 6 months, and those requiring
       prior approval within 4 months;
    4. Class 1 resubmissions within 2 months, and Class 2 resubmissions
       within 6 months.

   In addition, PDUFA II added a new set of procedural goals intended to
   improve FDA's responsiveness to, and communication with, industry
   sponsors during the early years of drug development. These goals
   specify timeframes for activities such as scheduling meetings and
   responding to various sponsor requests. While PDUFA's original intent
   was to speed up the review process, PDUFA II's intent is to speed up
   the entire drug development process.

   PDUFA has had a dramatic and undeniable impact on the drug review
   process. Total resources for drug review activities have increased from
   $120 million in 1992, before PDUFA was enacted, to an estimated $325
   million in FY 2002, about half of which will come from fees paid by
   industry. These resources allowed FDA to increase its drug and
   biological review staff by almost 60% between 1993 and 1997, adding
   about 660 staff-years to the program by 1997. By the end of PDUFA II in
   2002, FDA expects to have added another 313 staff-years of effort to
   this program. These additional staff, and resources to support them,
   have enabled FDA to respond more rapidly to new drug and biologic
   applications without compromising review quality.

   While it is important to note that PDUFA's goals specify decision
   times, not approval times, both decision and approval times have
   decreased dramatically. Total approval time, the time from the initial
   submission of a marketing application to the issuance of an approval
   letter, has dropped from a pre-PDUFA median of 23 months to 12 months.
   Total approval time for priority applications, those for products
   providing significant therapeutic gains, has dropped from a median of
   over 12 months in the early PDUFA years to 6 months. In addition,
   because FDA has put greater effort into communicating what it expects
   applicants to submit, a higher percentage of applications are being
   approved. Before PDUFA, only about 60 percent of the applications
   submitted were ultimately approved. Now, about 80 percent are approved.
   For the consumer, this has meant more products available more quickly.

   The agency has also encountered some challenges with PDUFA. Assuring
   that enough appropriated funds are spent on the process for the review
   of human drug applications to meet requirements of PDUFA, and at the
   same time spending our resources in a way that best protects the health
   and safety of the American people is becoming increasingly difficult.
   Each year, the amount that FDA must spend from appropriations on the
   drug review process is increased by an inflation factor. Yet since 1992
   FDA has not received increased appropriations to cover the costs of the
   across-the-board pay increases that must be given to all employees.

   The result is that our workforce and real resources for most programs
   other than PDUFA have contracted each year since 1992 while we struggle
   to assure that enough funds are spent on the drug review process to
   meet this PDUFA requirement. Several consecutive years of operating in
   this way have made it difficult to continue to further reduce staffing
   levels in FDA programs other than drug review. We are increasingly
   concerned that spending enough appropriations on the drug review
   process to meet the statutory conditions makes FDA less able to manage
   the resources available in a way that best protects the public health
   and merits public confidence. Just one example of an area we have not
   been able to fund adequately is responding to reports of adverse events
   related to the use of prescription drugs.
