                   Shipping and Mail Issues and Solutions


                        OBSTACLES TO SPEEDY DELIVERY
   Bad address: Mail is misaddressed/misdirected (30% of freight received
   estimated to have incomplete address). We also receive NCAR's mail,
   Gaithersburg's mail, mail for new or temporary employees that are
   unknown to Mail staff, other unknown recipients, etc. ALL have to be
   traced by the Shipping & Receiving or Mail staff. image of mail carrier
   Express packages delivered to site late: When Express packages arrive
   after 3:15 p.m. it is too late to call recipients or deliver.
   Sender error: Sender thinks their package was shipped earlier than it
   really was and tells recipient to expect it next day. It doesn't arrive
   until the following day.
   Recipient error:
   Recipients do not notify MASC Shipping & Receiving that an Express
   package is expected and needs priority notification/delivery.
   Weather: Weather delays result in late or no delivery by the commercial
   express carrier.
   Lost by carrier: Express company loses/misplaces package.
   Package received by someone other than addressee: Express package is
   delivered to recipient, but signed for by a designee. Recipient isn't
   notified right away.
   Carrier log error: Express carrier logs are sometimes not received or
   incomplete.
   Slow resolution of problem: Problems with carriers take time for
   tracking and or resolution.
