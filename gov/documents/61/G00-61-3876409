   Your generosity reaffirms the belief that a community's greatest
   strength lies in its people. Generous contributions through Leadership
   Giving send a message of responsibility and caring to us all. The CFC

   Depending on your level of giving, you will be given the option of
   selecting one of the following Leadership Giving Recognition items:

    THE EAGLE CLUB recognizes individuals who contribute $1,000 or more.
     The Eagle is a symbol of American Spirit and Hope. This generosity

   THE FLAG CLUB recognizes those contributors who pledge $500 - $999 per
    year. Flag Club members receive a colorful lapel pin and a CFC Mug as
                        recognition of their support.
