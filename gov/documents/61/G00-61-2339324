   This OML adds the following new section (3.6) to WSOM Chapter E-21:

   3.6 Interagency Support and Forecast Exchange. WFOs shall coordinate
   hydrologic forecast and warning activities with local, state, and
   regional cooperators and share information as per established
   agreements.

   WFOs shall work with cooperators responsible for management of stream
   gaging stations (e.g., district offices of the U.S. Geological Survey
   [USGS]) to establish working relationships. Procedures should be
   created to transfer information between agencies, including the
   exchange of real-time streamflow measurements and other data during
   significant flood events. WFO phone numbers shall be provided to the
   cooperators for posting in stream gage houses. WFOs and cooperators
   should meet periodically to keep informed of each agency's activities
   and collaborate on hydrologic field work (e.g., surveying high water
   marks, establishing staff gages) when appropriate.
