   About JPL Education
   spacer
   The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is NASA's lead center for the robotic
   exploration of space. JPL and NASA support many educational programs
   through the Education and Public Outreach Office. The educational
   materials at JPL are linked to our missions and projects. Our unique
   missions and projects cover a broad range of topics including Earth
   Science, robotics, Spaceflight, the Origins of Life and the Universe,
   and the Solar System to mention just a few. You can find many other
   educational resources on other areas of NASA research through the NASA
   link site.
   K-12
   For grade schools, Kindergarten through 12th Grade, we offer many
   materials and projects for teachers and students.
   Students
   For students we offer research information and fun activities. JPL's
   website is ideal for finding information for science fair projects, and
   research reports on all topics related to spaceflight and space,
   including the planets of our Solar System,the universe beyond our Solar
   System, the technology we use to explore space, and the Earth itself.
   Students can also find fun activities like competitions, and online
   interactive activities.
   Teachers
   K-12 Teachers can find many resources, workshops, announcements and
   more. The main institution that serves the K-12 teacher's needs is the
   Educator Resource Center.
   The projects and mission at JPL have also developed many lesson plans.
   These lesson plans are aligned to State and National Education
   Standards in science and mathematics.
   JPL projects and missions also sponsor teacher workshops and provide
   other opportunities to interact with personnel who work at JPL, like
   the JPL Open House, tours, and the Speakers Bureau. If you would like
   to be informed of events, workshops and announcements regarding
   opportunities please join our email list.
   University Programs:
   JPL University Programs primarily focus on providing promising science
   and engineering students with the opportunity to learn more about
   careers at JPL. The focus of these programs is on academic achievement,
   research and diversity. JPL sponsors many programs for undergraduates,
   graduates and post doctoral students. These programs also support
   university faculty in their research, and personnel and professional
   growth.
   Informal Education:
   JPL recognizes that education does not end with formal schooling. JPL
   promotes lifelong learning by working with informal educational
   institutions like museums, planetaria, aquariums, science centers, and
   other institutions that feature spaceflight, space and earth science,
   and technology. JPL loans exhibits, coordinates speakers, provides
   tours of JPL, and provides guidance on how best to use NASA and JPL
   resources for these institutions.
   You can email the JPL Education Gateway Curator if you have questions
   or comments.
