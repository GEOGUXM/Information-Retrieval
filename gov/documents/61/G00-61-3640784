   Branches of Government
   The American system of government is established by the United States
   Constitution, which provides for three separate but equal branches of
   government -- legislative, executive and judicial.

   Together, these branches make, execute, and interpret the laws that
   govern our country. Because each branch has both individual and shared
   powers, each is accountable to the others.

   This "checks and balances" system means that the balance of power in
   our government remains steady.
