   Did You Know?
     Did you know that the INEEL is one of America's enduring national
   treasures? We are proud to be strong contributors to the scientific and
   technical solutions of the nation's environmental, energy, and national
   security challenges. Below are just a few, among many remarkable, facts
   about this spectacular national resource.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Environmental Management

   Using vacuum extraction technology, the INEEL has removed and destroyed
   more than 79,000 pounds of volatile organic compounds from ground
   beneath the Radioactive Waste Management Complex since 1996.

   INEEL scientists have used "enhanced in situ bioremediation," a
   technology they developed, to eliminate a hazardous solvent from
   groundwater at Test Area North, saving $8 million from the previous
   remedy.

   An INEEL cleanup team safely removed toxic and explosive hydrogen
   fluoride from a 1950s-era burial site 10 months ahead of schedule and
   $43,000 under budget.

   Engineers and scientists are probing buried waste locations at the
   INEEL's Subsurface Disposal Area to learn more about how the waste
   behaves in the ground and determine ways to reduce future human and
   environmental risks.

   The INEEL has never missed a milestone in the Site Treatment Plan, an
   agreement with the state of Idaho governing the treatment and disposal
   of hazardous and radioactive waste.

   The INEEL has never missed a milestone from the Idaho Settlement
   Agreement, which guides the management of spent nuclear fuel and
   radioactive waste.

   The INEEL met all Fiscal Year 2000 Federal Facility Act/Compliance
   Order milestones ahead of schedule.

   The INEEL has sent 13 shipment of transuranic waste -- more than 103
   cubic meters -- out of Idaho for permanent disposal at the Waste
   Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico.

   Over 90,000 gallons of liquid sodium-bearing waste was calcined in
   Fiscal Year 2000, placing it in a more stable storage configuration.

   The INEEL moved spent nuclear fuel from old storage into more modern
   storage basins eight months ahead of schedule.

   The Department of Energy, the state of Idaho and the Environmental
   Protection Agency signed two Records of Decision for cleanup activities
   in 2000.

   In 2000, the INEEL was the first site in the nation to receive
   Integrated Safety Management verification.

   The INEEL disposed of 470 cubic meters of hazardous and radioactive
   waste outside the state of Idaho in 2000.

   More than 811 cubic meters of hazardous and radioactive waste were
   treated in 2000, making it the most waste ever treated at the INEEL in
   a single year.

   The INEEL disposed of 4,260 cubic meters of low-level waste in 2000.

   Fifty High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters were treated
   through a leaching process in 2000, meeting a Site Treatment Plan
   milestone.

   In 2000, 97 canisters of Three Mile Island-II spent nuclear fuel and
   core debris were removed from water storage and shipped to the Idaho
   Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center for placement in dry storage.

   Construction of the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Facility began in
   2000, after final permits were received from the state of Idaho. The
   facility will treat 65,000 cubic meters of transuranic waste per an
   agreement with the state.

   National Security

   The INEEL's PINS system non-intrusively identifies chemicals within
   containers and has been used extensively by the U.S. Army to determine
   the contents of suspect chemical weapons.

   An INEEL-developed system for non-intrusively identifying chemicals
   within containers was used to solve the mystery of the contents of
   abandoned gas cylinders at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering
   Center.

   INEEL statisticians helped the Internal Revenue Service evaluate its
   processes for payment collection by mapping the processes selected and
   their success rates.

   An INEEL-developed reporting, inventory and processing system helps
   make shipping waste drums to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant almost
   paperless by using smart cards and a patent-pending electronic
   signature process.

   The Idaho Accelerator Center -- located at Idaho State University and
   established by ISU, the Department of Energy and the INEEL -- leads the
   way in radiation science and accelerator research and education.

   The INEEL developed and delivered the Transportable Munitions
   Assessment System to Greece to aid in the recovery and destruction of
   obsolete munitions.

   The Transportable Munitions Assessment System contains three
   INEEL-developed systems that enable operators to handle, recover and
   destroy old munitions safely.

   The INEEL is a collaborator on the Russian Ecological Biotrade Center,
   which will employ former Soviet weapons scientists to explore the
   potential for developing new commercial products using Russia's
   biodiversity.

   The INEEL's Specific Manufacturing Capability project has an
   unblemished record of providing life-saving armor for the Army's main
   battle tank on time, within budget and within specifications.

   The Army is so satisfied with the INEEL's tank armor project that it
   announced in 2000 that it is expanding the project to develop
   side-armor packages.

   Research at the INEEL's Advanced Test Reactor and Naval Reactors
   Facility have contributed to the extension of the life of nuclear fuel
   on Navy vessels, so that some nuclear-powered ships never have to be
   refueled.
