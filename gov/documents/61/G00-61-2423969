   Advanced Component Technologies (ACT) implements technology
   developments that advance the state-of-the-art of instruments, earth-
   and space-based platforms, and Earth Science Enterprise information
   systems.  The ACT program focuses requirements, defines technology
   roadmaps, refines reference-mission scenarios, advances component and
   subsystem developments, and leverages technology investments by
   collaborating with national and international agencies, and with
   private industry in the U.S.

   Objectives:
    To research, develop, and demonstrate component- and subsystem-level
   technologies that reduce risk, cost, size, mass, and development time
   of earth-science missions and infrastructure.  This segment of the
   overall ESTO program advances core component technologies to a
   technology readiness level that enables their eventual infusion into ES
   missions.

   Program Description:
   The program is designed to bring instrument, platforms, and information
   system components to a maturity level that allows their integration
   into other NASA technology-development programs such as the Instrument
   Incubator Program and  the New Millennium Program.  Some components are
   directly infused into mission designs by ES flight projects.  The
   program also develops new ways to perform measurements and to process
   ES data products to expand ES research and application capabilities.
   Program Elements:
   The ACT development process is implemented though two primary areas if
   involvement:

     Research Activities

     Advanced Concept Development -- ACT research explores innovative
     concepts for sensing, processing, and dissemination of ES data
     products.  For instance, ESTO is helping develop a Vision to guide
     far-term activities of the Enterprise.  This Vision will outline a
     national Earth Science program for the 2010 ~ 2025 period that seeks
     to advance key research and applications areas related to the
     Earth's environment.  To date, ESTO has funded several
     Vision-development workshops and is the primary agent in the
     synthesis of results from these activities.  As the vision work
     progresses ESTO will conduct further studies that develop and
     evaluate proposed architecture concepts to understand the scope of
     technical capabilities implied by the vision's scenarios.

   System Studies -- System studies are conducted to identify and
   understand science requirements, evaluate feasibility of new
   measurement approaches, refine promising concepts, identify
   technology-option trades, and to understand alternative means of
   technology development and infusion.

   Development Activities
   Component Technology Development -- This element of ACT addresses
   advancement of components that provide new measurement and
   infrastructure capabilities for the Enterprise.  Although ACT component
   technologies can support any of the three ESTO product lines, current
   investments are primarily geared toward development of components for
   the instrument product line.

     Investments -- ACT provides funding to focus requirements on the
     following topics:
     * Advanced concepts and system studies
     * Technology roadmaps
     * Core Technology Developments that advance component
       state-of-the-art
     * Technology Advocacy and Partnering
