   Our mission is to provide flexible, responsive, easy to use,
   cost-effective services. We award contracts timely and provide
   responsive contract administration. Our contractors provide effective
   and high quality  services. Our program's success depends on our
   ability to offer services that are cost-effective and attractive.

                    This attractiveness is derived from:
   [clearpixel.gif] [clearpixel.gif]

                    1) competitive pricing;
                    2) expert project and contract administration; and
                    3) responsive, quality contractor performance.
