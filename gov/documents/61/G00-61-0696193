       See Secretary's Memorandum 4710-1: the USDA Alternative Dispute
                             Resolution Policy.

     The Cooperative Resolution Program is a voluntary program that uses
     mediation to resolve disputes quickly and at the earliest possible
                                   stage.

                       Mediation offers the following:
     * An opportunity to be heard

     * An opportunity to develop new ways of dealing with a dispute

     * An opportunity to create your own solution.
