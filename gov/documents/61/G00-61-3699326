        International Program of the National Institute on Drug Abuse

   Welcome to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) International
   Home Page. This is the online source for information about NIDA's
   International Program, which coordinates this Institute's collaborative
   activities with scientists in other countries, with government agencies
   in other countries, and with international organizations. The NIDA
   International Program fosters international cooperative research and
   the exchange of scientific information by drug abuse researchers around
   the globe. NIDA's international objectives include:
     * Promoting an international cohort of scientists who are
       knowledgeable of NIDA's research and methods;
     * Encouraging rigorous collaborative and peer-reviewed international
       research;
     * Providing professional development opportunities and technical
       consultation to the international drug abuse research community;
       and
     * Disseminating NIDA's research findings to international scientists
       and organizations.

   To help us carry out our vision for international cooperation, NIDA
   created the International Visiting Scientists and Technical Exchange
   Program (INVEST), which implements a number of the NIDA International
   Program initiatives.
