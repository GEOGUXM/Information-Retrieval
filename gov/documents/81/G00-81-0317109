   Note: the NASA Space Telerobotics Program was shut down in 1997, and
   the research and technology development task supported by the program
   were transferred to other efforts. This site is kept on line for
   historical purposes, and as a reference for the robotics community. It
   reflects the state of robotics technology as it was at the end of the
   program in 1997, and not the current NASA efforts in robotics
   technology and space system development.

   The NASA Space Telerobotics Program is an element of NASA's ongoing
   research program, under the responsibility of the Office of Space
   Science. The program is designed to develop telerobotic capabilities
   for remote mobility and manipulation, by merging robotics and
   teleoperations and creating new telerobotics technologies.

   Space robotics technology requirements can be characterized by the need
   for manual and automated control, non-repetitive tasks, time delay
   between operator and manipulator, flexible manipulators with complex
   dynamics, novel locomotion, operations in the space environment, and
   the ability to recover from unplanned events. To meet these needs, the
   program is focused on the following goal:

     To develop, integrate and demonstrate the science and technology of
     remote manipulation such that by the year 2004, 50% of the
     EVA-required operations on orbit and on planetary surfaces may be
     conducted telerobotically.

   The Space Telerobotics Program consists of a wide range of tasks from
   basic scientific research to applications developed to solve specific
   operations problems. The program is focused on three specific mission
   or application areas: on-orbit assembly and servicing, science payload
   tending, and planetary surface robotics. Within each of these areas,
   the program supports the development of robotic component technologies,
   development of complete robots, and implementation of complete robotic
   systems focussed on the specific mission needs. These three segments
   align with the application of space telerobotics to the class of
   missions identified by the potential space robotics user community. The
   objective of each of these program areas, from base technology
   development through systems applications, is to provide the technology
   for space telerobotics applications with sufficient validation that the
   designers of future spacecraft can apply the technology with
   confidence.
