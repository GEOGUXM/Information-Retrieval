Partnerships in Law Enforcement

       The Atlanta Division participates in many programs and joint task
   forces with local, county, state, and other federal law enforcement
   agencies.  Some of the various programs and task forces are described
   below.

   Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF)

       JTTFs maximize interagency coordination and cooperation to address
   terrorism problems facing federal, state, and local law enforcement
   authorities.  JTTFs are staffed by FBI agents and federal, state, and
   local law enforcement officers.  The Atlanta Division initiated a JTTF
   in 1994.  Agencies that are currently participating in the Atlanta
   FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force are:


   Bullet 1 of Joint Task Force section U.S. Customs Service
   Bullet 2 of Joint Task Force section U.S. Department of
                                        State--Diplomatic Security Service
   Bullet 3 of Joint Task Force section U.S. Immigration and
                                        Naturalization Service
   Bullet 4 of Joint Task Force section U.S. Secret Service
   Bullet 5 of Joint Task Force section Georgia Bureau of Investigation
   Bullet 6 of Joint Task Force section Atlanta Police Department

       The mission of the Atlanta Division JTTF is to identify, penetrate,
   and neutralize any terrorist activity directed against the citizens of
   the United States, particularly in the State of Georgia.

       The JTTF conducts investigations of both domestic and international
   terrorist groups.

   Metro Atlanta Auto Theft Task Force

       The Metro Atlanta Auto Theft Task Force (MAATTF) was created in
   1995.  The mission of the MAATTF is to identify and investigate the
   criminal activity of major automobile theft rings in the greater
   Atlanta area.  The MAATTF focuses on federal violations, including the
   Hobbs Act, continuing criminal enterprise, importation or exportation
   of stolen motor vehicles, interstate transportation of stolen motor
   vehicles, title fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and
   "chop" shops.  The MAATTF includes members from federal, state, and
   local law enforcement, as well as the National Insurance Crime Bureau.

   Southeast Bomb Task Force

       The Southeast Bomb Task Force (SBTF) was initially created to
   investigate the bombing of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta,
   Georgia, at the Centennial Olympic Park on July 27, 1996.  The task
   force subsequently began investigating the January 16, 1997, bombing of
   the Sandy Springs Professional Building in Sandy Springs, GA; the
   February 21, 1997, bombing of The Otherside Lounge in Atlanta, GA; and
   the January 29, 1998, bombing of the New Woman All Women Health Care
   Clinic in Birmingham, Alabama.  Eric Robert Rudolph has been charged in
   all four of the bombing incidents and has been named as one of the
   FBIÂ’s Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives.  Currently, the SBTF is
   concentrating its investigative efforts on the fugitive hunt for Eric
   Robert Rudolph in the Nantahala National Forest located in western
   North Carolina.

       The SBTF, under the leadership of an FBI Inspector in Charge, is
   comprised of investigators from the Atlanta, Birmingham, and Charlotte
   offices of the FBI, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of
   Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Birmingham Police Department, and
   other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in Georgia,
   North Carolina, and Alabama.  Anyone wishing to provide information on
   the whereabouts of Eric Robert Rudolph may do so by calling the SBTF
   Hotline at 1-800-575-9873.  There is a one-million dollar reward being
   offered for information leading to the arrest of Eric Robert Rudolph.


   Fugitive Task Force

       The Atlanta Division is responsible for the apprehension of
   fugitive felons that have either departed the State of Georgia after a
   felony warrant has been issued in the State of Georgia, or fugitive
   felons for whom a felony warrant has been issued in another state.
   This Federal process involves the filing of an Unlawful Flight to Avoid
   Prosecution warrant in the state in which the original felony was
   charged.   The issuance of this warrant enables the FBI to pursue
   fugitives throughout the continental United States and in many foreign
   countries in which extradition treaties have been established.

      The FBI commonly offers rewards for assistance in the location of
   fugitives.  Information about fugitives currently sought by the FBI can
   be found on the FBI Fugitives Page.

       Individuals with information regarding fugitives are asked to
   report this information to the Atlanta FBI Field Office.  Information
   provided to the FBI resulting in the location and apprehension of
   fugitives may be provided on a confidential basis.  The FBI will take
   the necessary steps to protect the source of the information where
   appropriate.

       When providing information, try to be as specific as possible with
   information that might lead to the fugitive's arrest, i.e., address;
   make, model, and license plate of automobile driven by the fugitive;
   place of employment; or other pertinent information that might be of
   assistance in locating the individual.


   INFRAGARD/ANSIR

       The National Infragard Program is a cooperative effort between the
   FBI and an association of businesses, academic institutions, state and
   local law enforcement agencies, and other participants.  The purpose of
   Infragard is to increase the cyber and physical security of U.S.
   infrastructures through an ongoing exchange of information with public
   and private-sector owners and operators of critical infrastructure
   facilities.

       In conjunction with the Infragard Program, the FBI provides
   information regarding national security issues to corporate directors
   and executives, law enforcement, and other government agencies through
   the ANSIR (Awareness of National Security Issues and Response)
   Program.  ANSIR provides unclassified national security threat and
   warning information to ANSIR participants.

       The Atlanta Division is currently forming a local Infragard
   chapter. To obtain additional information about qualifications for
   membership in the Infragard Program or participation in the ANSIR
   Program, please contact:


             Infraguard Coordinator, Harold Phipps 404-679-9000



   NATIONAL ACADEMY

       The National Academy (NA) is an FBI program dedicated to the
   advancement of professionalism in law enforcement.  The comprehensive
   curriculum lasts 11 weeks and is taught at the FBI Academy in Quantico,
   Virginia.  Students attend courses in Police Management, Behavioral
   Science, Criminal Law, Law Enforcement Communication Arts, Forensic
   Science, and Health/Fitness.  NA students earn college credits from the
   University of Virginia upon graduation.  Attendance is virtually cost
   free for the departments and is highly desirable for those seeking
   advancement into positions of leadership.  Each year, the NA graduates
   approximately 1100 students.  These graduates represent law enforcement
   agencies from around the globe.  Georgia typically sends approximately
   24 students per year from mid- and upper-level management positions in
   local and state law enforcement.


   POLICE SCHOOLS

       The Atlanta Division actively provides specialized training to
   local police agencies throughout the state. Once a formal training
