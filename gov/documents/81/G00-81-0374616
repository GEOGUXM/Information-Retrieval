   The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has announced $1 million
   in new funding to support a pioneering conservation and tourism project
      involving some of the world's most beautiful and fragile natural
                                environments.

    According to a January 24 press release, the global cosmetics company
   Aveda has agreed to give $500,000 to the U.N.-sponsored World Heritage
        sites project, which uses tourism to help mitigate threats to
    biodiversity conservation. The new funds will be matched by an equal
          amount from the United Nations Foundation. Complete text

           U.S. Launches New Visa for Victims of Human Trafficking

   U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft has announced the implementation of
      a special visa designed for victims of trafficking in persons who
     cooperate with law enforcement against those responsible for their
                                enslavement.

   In a prepared statement released January 24, the Attorney General said
    the so-called T visa -- created by the Trafficking Victims Protection
     Act -- allows victims who would suffer "unusual and severe harm" if
      returned to their home countries to remain in the United States.
