   Permitting and Operating Internal Combustion Engine Driven Generators

   AVAPCD
   An individual interested in generating electrical power at a location
   within the Antelope Valley Air Pollution Control District (AVAPCD) has
   three options: a portable/rental unit, an AVAPCD-permitted emergency
   unit, or an AVAPCD-permitted regular (non-emergency) unit. Any internal
   combustion engine (IC engine) with a maximum rating greater than 50
   brake-horsepower requires an AVAPCD permit, unless the IC engine is a
   portable unit operating under a valid California Air Resources Board
   portable equipment certificate.

   Portable Unit
   Operation under a valid portable equipment certificate is limited to
   twelve months at one location, and requires notification of the AVAPCD
   when the unit is brought into the District. The emissions of the
   portable unit will count towards the emissions of the facility where it
   is located, which means the facility is responsible for logging
   operation of the portable unit in terms of hours and/or fuel use. Note
   that the AVAPCD would consider continued or consecutive operation of a
   portable unit beyond twelve months at one location to be circumvention
   of AVAPCD permitting requirements, resulting in a violation/compliance
   and permitting action.

   Emergency Unit
   An IC engine intended for use as an emergency unit will be limited to
   200 hours per year of operation (including periodic testing), but
   contact the AVAPCD regarding special use limits during calendar year
   2001. An emergency IC engine (compression ignited and diesel fueled,
   the most common type) is limited to the following emissions limits (in
   grams per brake-horsepower-hour): 6.9 NOx, 8.5 CO, 1.0 VOC, and 0.38
   PM10. These limits can be met by an engine that is certified to meet
   the USEPA Non-Road Tier 1 limits. An emergency IC engine is also
   required to burn diesel with a maximum sulfur content of 0.05% by
   weight. The owner/operator of an emergency IC engine is required to log
   operational and testing hours and/or fuel use. The application fee for
   an emergency IC engine rated 500 bhp or less is $297.70; for an engine
   rated greater than 500 bhp the application fee is $756.10 (annual fees
   for any emergency IC engine are $171.90).

   Regular (Non-Emergency) Unit
   Regardless of fuel type, a new or modified IC engine is required to
   emit no more than 0.15 grams per brake-horsepower of NOx or VOC. As a
   practical matter, a new IC engine can only meet these limits if it is
   fueled with natural gas and vented through a Selective Catalytic
   Reduction device with ammonia injection. The maximum annual emissions
   of an IC engine added to an existing major facility (where the annual
   emission exceed 4 tons per year of NOx, VOC, SOx or PM10) must be fully
   offset with emission reduction credits. The maximum annual emissions of
   an IC engine added to a minor facility will also trigger offset
   requirements if the total exceeds 4 tons per year of NOx, VOC, SOx or
   PM10.
