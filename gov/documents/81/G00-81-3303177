     __________________________________________________________________

   Research carried out by the Global Change Team falls into two general
   categories:

   (1) studies of past conditions designed to distinguish anthropogenic
   change from natural climate variability and to improve and evaluate
   computer-based general circulation models (GCMs), and
   (2) studies of environmental processes directed towards understanding
   how modern processes interact with global change.

   Research topics include:

     * Impacts of Climate Change and Land Use on the Southwestern United
       States
          + Possible Sighting of Asian Dust in Eastern Utah
          + Photos and information on dust studies in California and
            Nevada deserts
          + Geology, Ecology, and Land Use in the Hopi Buttes area, Navajo
            Nation, Arizona
          + Using Remote Sensing to Detect Active Dust Storms and Map
            Areas Vulnerable to Eolian Erosion
     * Climate Change and Environmental Response in the Western United
       States (Lake/Catchment Systems - LACS)
          + Extent of Pleistocene Lakes in the Western Great Basin
     * Last Interglacial - Timing and Extent
     * Yukon Basin
          + How Does Climate Change Influence Alaska's Vegetation?
          + An Illustrated Diary of Summer 1998 Field Investigations in
            Southern Alaska
     * Glacier Studies
          + A Low-Cost Mechanical "Access" Drill for Polar Glaciology
            (PDF)
          + Borehole Temperature Logs from Arctic Alaska, pre-1989
     * Rio Puerco Basin
     * Great Plains Dunes
          + Will The Dunes March Again? (Smithsonian Magazine, Dec. 1997)
     * Climate and Vegetation Changes
          + Assessing Potential Future Changes in Climate, Hydrology, and
            Vegetation in the Western United States
          + Quantitative Paleoclimatic Reconstructions From Late
            Pleistocene Plant Macrofossils of the Yucca Mountain Region
     * Carbon Cycle
          + Magnitude and Significance of Carbon Burial in Lakes,
            Reservoirs, and Northern Peatlands
          + Evidence of Climate Change over the Last 10,000 Years from the
            Sediments of Lakes in the Upper Mississippi Basin
          + Geochemistry of Sediments From Tule Lake, California
