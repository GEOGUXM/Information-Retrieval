   [USEMAP:img3.gif]

   It is the purpose of the court's mediation program to provide
   mediation  services  with  resultant savings  in  time  and expenses to
   litigants and the court without sacrificing the quality of justice to
   be rendered or the right of the litigants to trial in the event a
   voluntary settlement satisfactory to the parties is not achieved
   through the mediation procedures.
   Participants Report that Mediation:
     * SAVES MONEY

          (In 2000, attorneys and parties participating in mediations
   reported     an average estimated cost savings of $21,532.18 by
   resolving their case by mediation.  See 2000 Annual Report, p. 12.)

     * SAVES TIME

          (Attorneys reported an average per case time savings of 109.17
   hours by settling their case in mediation. See 2000 Annual Report, p.
   12.)

     * ADDRESSES MATTERS BROADER THAN THE LEGAL ISSUES IN THE CASE

     * HELPS PARTIES RECOGNIZE THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF SETTLEMENT

     * SUCCESSFUL IN A MAJORITY OF CASES FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA

           (90% of cases mediated in 2000 settled either "at the table" or
   as a direct result of the mediation.  Over the course of the program
   (since late 1995) this "Effective Settlement Rate" is 62%.  See 2000
   Annual Report, p. 9.)
