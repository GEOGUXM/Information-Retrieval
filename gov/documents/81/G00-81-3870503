Orientation and Mobility

   O&M classes are provided on an individual basis to students by
   credentialed Orientation and Mobility Specialists, to learn independent
   travel skills, based on each persons needs and abilities. This includes
   proper use of the long cane when appropriate for mobility, and concept
   development and spatial awareness for orientation purposes.

   Students are assessed and evaluated using the Texas School for the
   Blind TAPS curriculum and assessment, and other instruments as needed.
   Low vision devices are incorporated into a students program as
   appropriate.

   Students learn to travel around the WSSB campus for needed routes to
   classes and activities. Those who are cognitively able learn
   age-appropriate travel skills off campus to various locations in the
   greater Vancouver and Portland area. All students receive the
   opportunity to learn rote routes in the vicinity of the school to the
   best of their ability.

   Off campus lessons include basic and advanced residential travel
   skills, including crossing streets independently; business area travel
   skills, including bus travel; rural area travel as appropriate to a
   particular student; and major metropolitan travel in a downtown
   setting. O&M night evaluations and lessons are provided to partially
   sighted students when age appropriate.

   Safety and awareness of ones surroundings is also emphasized. Students
   may earn Walking Papers, or permission to travel independently after
   school hours to local businesses and community activities. They do this
   by demonstrating competency as a skilled, independent traveler, who can
   problem solve and remain safe and oriented without instructor
   assistance. Students are encouraged to travel with friends, or in a
   small group, for off-campus activities. They may also earn night travel
   papers when they are old enough to go off-campus unsupervised after
   dark.

   Students with multiple disabilities receive instruction for concept
   development and independent campus travel, and off campus travel as
   appropriate to their needs. Some students are introduced to alternative
   mobility devices when needed to teach them safe, independent travel at
   school. When possible these students are transitioned to a long cane,
   or adapted long cane, as their ability permits.

   O&M staff are active in the AERBVI professional organization, and work
   with city and county officials in both an advisory capacity, and to
   enhance the safety of all pedestrians.
