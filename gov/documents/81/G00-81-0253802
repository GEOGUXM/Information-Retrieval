   * Implementing a Standard Enforcement Seat Belt Law in Your State: A
          How-to Guide(posted 10/11/01)
          The benefits of statewide standard (primary) seat belt laws have
          been well documented. The enactment of such a law has been shown
          in a variety of states to results in a 10-15% increase in seat
          belt use in the first year after enactment. Combined with
          aggressive enforcement and widespread publicity and public
          education efforts, seat belt use can be increased even further.
          This publication will be of great interest to traffic safety
          leaders and legislators as they consider advocating for and
          introducing standard seat belt legislation in their States.

   * Click It or Ticket (posted 7/5/01)
          The document summarizes the implementation of South Carolina's
          Diversity Outreach Subcommittee to (1) develop recommendations
          to ensure that during their Click It or Ticket mobilization,
          differential enforcement (i.e., racial profiling) would not
          occur and (2) to assist in marketing the campaign to the
          minority community to generate increases in seat belt/child seat
          use. As a result of the program, a 14.3% increase in seat belt
          use rates by the minority community was realized - and without a
          single complaint of harassment received by any enforcement
          agency in the state.

                (from 1996 to 1998) and 11 percent increase (from 1994 to
