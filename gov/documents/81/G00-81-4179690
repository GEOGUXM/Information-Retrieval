   On November 18th, 2001 the annual Leonid meteor shower was at it's
   peak. Marylanders saw 200 meteors per hour or more, between 4:00 and
   6:00 am Sunday morning. This year's Leonid shower was predicted by some
   models to be spectacular, and it did not disappoint. The 2001 Leonid
   shower exceeded the spectacular 1998 show. Reports from Hawaii
   indicated over 1200 meteors per hour were observed.

   I (your web master) got up a 4:00 am to view the Leonids. I live north
   of Baltimore and our neighborhood suffers from urban suburban light
   pollution. The early morning hours brought dense fog, but we could see
   stars directly overhead. Because of the relatively poor viewing
   conditions, we could only see the brightest meteors. Even with these
   viewing problems we saw as many as 12 meteors a minute. Many were
   bright green meteors with long, persistent trails. The fog began to
   clear around 5:00 am and the peak of the shower seemed to occur around
   this time. Our family of four was sitting, bundled in quilts, on deck
   chairs at the side of the road to watch the show. The newspaper
   delivery man, and more than a few deer were startled by our presence.

   this winter.
