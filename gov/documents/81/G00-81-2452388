   Impetus/How Project Began Interlaboratory studies have long been used
   to ensure measurement capability for commerce since accurate
   measurements are necessary for assessing product specifications. For
   this reason design and analysis of interlaboratory studies have been an
   important part of the ITL Statistical Engineering Division's (ITL/SED)
   work for many years. Recently, however, a new type of interlaboratory
   study, known as a key comparison, has taken a critical new place in the
   NIST mission. In the last year, key comparisons, international
   interlaboratory studies for comparing measurement results between
   leading National Metrology Institutes (NMI's), have provided many new
   opportunities for ITL/SED to collaborate with scientists across NIST.
   The impetus for these new opportunities is a Mutual Recognition
   Arrangement (MRA) signed by the NMI's belonging to the International
   Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) "to establish the degree of
   equivalence of national measurement standards maintained by NMI's, to
   provide for the mutual recognition of calibration and measurement
   certificates issued by NMI's, [and] thereby to provide governments and
   other parties with a secure technical foundation for wider agreements
   related to international trade, commerce and regulatory affairs."
   Objective(s) Key comparisons serve as the technical basis for the MRA
   and must therefore accurately reflect the true relationships between
   measurement systems maintained by NMI's belonging to the CIPM. The
   results of key comparisons must also be extensible to members of
   Regional Metrology Organizations (RMO's) to maximize recognition of
   measurement capabilities that exist in other metrology laboratories
   around the world.
   Staffing Profile and Funding FTE = 1.0 (Mathematical Statistician)

   Funding is for $220K STRS.

   What Work Has ITL Done ITL/SED contributions to interlaboratory studies
   and key comparisons include the following.
     * Performed data analyses which account for covariances in the
       measurements used to compute differences in results between labs
       and which ensure that uncertainties have a confidence level of 95%,
       as outlined in MRA policies.
     * Contributed in the computation of reference values from
       interlaboratory data. Reference values are a sometimes
       controversial part of the MRA whose real role is still currently
       being worked out at both the policy and technical levels. The
       earliest key comparisons, those analyzed to date, have often used
       designs which allow for straight-forward computation of the
       necessary measurement differences but give less consideration to
       computation of uncertainties. Based on contacts from current work,
       however, ITL/SED has recently begun to contribute to comparison
       designs, ensuring that data collection will be as effective as
       possible. Opportunities to impact the design and analysis of
       comparisons have also been bolstered by participation in
       international meetings on interlaboratory studies organized by
       statisticians and other researchers from NMI's.

   What Work Has Been Done By Collaborators The contributions of
   collaborators include the following.
     * Design of comparison studies.
     * Coordination with BIPM and comparison participants.
     * Data collection.
     * Dissemination of Key Comparison results.

   What Developments Have Occurred and How Has the Project Changed Nothing
   to report at this time.
   Publications or Artifacts This project has generated the following
   publications. The Comite Consultatif or other sponsor of each Key
   Comparison will publish a full report on each comparison. The results
   of each comparison will also be available in the BIPM Key Comparison
   Database at
     * http://www.bipm.fr/enus/8_Key_Comparisons/database.html (English)
       and
     * http://www.bipm.fr/fra/8_Key_Comparisons/database.html (French).

   Summaries of each report will also be published in Metrologia.
   How Industries Have Benefited From NIST's Work Customers of key
   comparisons include NMI's in the CIPM and the various RMO's, secondary
   government and commercial metrology laboratories, and end-users of
   secondary metrology labs' services. The success of the MRA, based on
   successful key comparisons, will reduce measurement-based barriers to
   international trade by promoting convergence of measurement techniques.
   Assessment and discussion of measurement capabilities in an open forum
   may encourage NMI's to improve absolute measurement capabilities as
   well.
   Acknowledgements of the ITL's Effort Acknowledgements of ITL's efforts
   in the design and analysis of key comparisons include co-authorship and
   formal acknowledgment in official Key Comparison reports.
   Future Related Activities The recent signing (October, 1999) of the MRA
   has led to a large increase in the number of interlaboratory studies
   that ITL/SED is involved in. The fact that international recognition of
   measurement services that the NMI's offer is directly supported by
   regular participation in relevant key comparisons suggests that this
   area will be an increasingly important source of ITL activity for some
   time. As more key comparisons are finished there is likely to be a need
   for ITL/SED to answer questions about the linkages between key
   comparisons and the measurement services that they are designed to
   support.
   Additional Information There are no links to additional information at
   this time.
