   This page details plans and accomplishments with regards to integrated
   energy and environmental analysis. These tasks are proceding in
   distinct stages.

   In Stage #1 (1998- June 1999), A multi-topic energy and environmental
   site with a focus on the new African country of Eritrea was developed.
   We established a basic web site and started putting documents, papers
   and basic images on the web. In addition we utilized a PC-base program
   (the Image Display and Analysis program) to produce images at
   resolutions of typically a few kilometers using a few years of data. We
   produced data of basic climatic variables: temperature, rain, wind, and
   solar radiation.

   In Stage #2 (June 1999 - Jan. 2000), we have gradually increased the
   accuracy, resolution, interactivity, and sophistication of the
   geographic information models.  In addition we have also expanded into
   more economic modeling issues.  The study area for the geographic
   analysis tools are expaned to include the Southwest U.S. and possibly
   other study areas  We also upgraded the tools being used for the data
   analysis and presentation, increasing capacity in Perl-based CGI and
   graphic image processing capabilities. The activities for the
   geographical analysis has included some of the following:
     * Developing detailed disaggregated economic forecasting models for
       evaluating the costs, benefits and impacts of energy efficiency
       standards and policies.
     * Increasing resolution to of geographic information to approximately
       1 km when possible
     * Increasing the accuracy of the mapping projections and decreasing
       location errors
     * Expanding temporal coverage to include vegetation and rainfall from
       1981 to present at 8 km resolution.
     * Including some current, real-time image data
     * Developing an interactive data retrieval interface
     * Developing an ecosystem model with priority given to biomass,
       woodfuel, and rangeland production estimates.
     * Expanding color resolution to 255 colors for GIF images. e.g. See
       wind maps such as wsav01.html
     * Developing more sophisticated models.  These might include
       hydrology, atmospheric motions, geomorphology, and/or agricultural
       and ecosystem production.

   As of January 2000, some of this work has been completed, while some of
   the finishing touches on other components has yet to be completed.

   In Stage #3 (Jan. 2000 - Dec. 2000), we are developing an integrated
   information system framework for providing energy and environmental
   data and policy analysis tools on a global scale. This involves
   creating a framework for organizing economic and other data along with
   software, standards, and tools for automating the construction and
   development of disaggregated accounting models with dynamic feedback.
   This effort is described in more detail on the pages on economic
   modeling. We also will be doing training in information systems and
   software development to help build the human resources capacity to feed
   into these information systems development efforts. In this work there
   are several key tasks to be completed over the next year:
     * Formulate the basic rules, structure, and strategic software design
       and development strategy for a Distributed Disaggregated Modeling
       Protocol (DDMP) and its attendant user application software.
     * Produce some prototype applications that can demonstrate DDMP
       concepts and ideas.
     * Test and evaluate DDMP applications, demonstrations, and model
       development environment vis-a-vis the project goals of producing
       more powerful models with less development time.
     * Extend the energy and environment data sets and models for the
       Eritrea test case to have greater, detail, accuracy, and coverage.
     * Develop, expand, and extend energy and environment databases to
       have global coverage when possible.
     * Do automated rough-cut energy efficiency policy and energy and
       resources analyses for all countries using simplified policy impact
       and analysis models.
     * Conduct courses in Perl programming, Web CGI (Common Gateway
       Interface), and Web graphics.

   The current tasks will provide the technical and human resources for
   improving the information systems and policy analysis tools for energy
   efficiency policy analysis. There is also the possibility that these
   efforts will provide multidisciplinary information resources on a wide
   range of energy and environment issues. The potential for
   multidisciplinary applications and links to other environment, energy,
   and resource issues will also be explored during the course of this
   research.
