                     FINAL 4(d) RULES FOR PACIFIC SALMON

   January 17, 2002

   Seven Washington counties and more than a dozen Washington cities have
   submitted to NMFS a joint routine road maintenance program aimed at
   protecting salmon listed under the Endangered Species Act. The
   fisheries service is asking for public comment on the proposed program
   before it makes any final decision on whether or not to approve it. You
   can read the notice published in the Federal Register about the program
   or go to the proposal itself by clicking on these links. Comments on
   the proposal should be sent to Laura Hamilton, NMFS, 510 Desmond Drive,
   Suite 103, Lacey WA 98503. Comments must be received by February 25.

   Endangered Species Act (ESA) 4(d) rules provide protections for species
   listed as "threatened." These 4(d) rules put take prohibitions in place
   except for specific categories of activities that contribute to
   conserving listed salmon and steelhead.
