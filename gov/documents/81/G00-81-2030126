   July 2000 Abstract The MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator was developed for
   the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer
   (ASTER) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
   projects. ASTER and MODIS are both spaceborne imaging instruments on
   the Terra platform launched in the fall of 1999. Currently MASTER is
   flown on the Department of Energy (DOE) King Air Beachcraft B200
   aircraft and the NASA DC-8. In order to validate the in-flight
   performance of the instrument, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the
   University of Arizona conducted a joint experiment in December 1998.
   The experiment involved overflights of the MASTER instrument at two
   sites at three elevations (2000, 4000, and 6000 m). The two sites:
   Ivanpah Playa, California, and Lake Mead, Nevada, were selected to
   validate the visible±shortwave infrared and thermal infrared (TIR)
   channels, respectively. At Ivanpah Playa, a spectrometer was used to
   determine the surface reflectance and a sun photometer used to obtain
   the optical depth. At Lake Mead contact and radiometric surface lake
   temperatures were measured by buoy-mounted thermistors and
   self-calibrating radiometers, respectively. Atmospheric profiles of
   temperature, pressure, and relative humidity were obtained by launching
   an atmospheric sounding balloon. The measured surface radiances were
   then propagated to the at-sensor radiance using radiative transfer
   models driven by the local atmospheric data. There was excellent
   agreement between the predicted radiance at sensor and the measured
   radiance at sensor at all three altitudes. The percent difference
   between the channels not strongly affected by the atmosphere in the
   visible±shortwave infrared was typically 1±5% and the percent
   difference between the TIR channels not strongly affected by the
   atmosphere was typically less than 0.5%. These results indicate the
   MASTER instrument should provide a well-calibrated instrument for Earth
   Science Studies. It should prove particularly valuable for those
   studies that leverage information across the electromagnetic spectrum
   from the visible to the TIR. D 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

   conduct a validation experiment on each platform. The validation of
   MASTER on the B200 platform is described herein. MASTER can acquire
   data with pixel sizes in the range of 5±25 m from this platform
   depending on surface and flight altitude. It should be noted that a
   custom air-fence was installed on the B200 to minimize calibration
   errors due to wind-blast over the exposed refer- ence blackbodies. This
   phenomenon, first observed with the TIMS instrument flying on the NASA
   C-130 aircraft, produces a differential cooling on the surface of the
   black- body that makes it impossible to accurately measure its
   temperature (Schmugge, Becker, & Li, 1991). A properly sized air-fence,
   installed forward of the scanner viewing aperture, minimizes turbulent
   airflow over these surfaces. Empirical data show that this greatly
   increases the calibra- tion accuracy of the IR channels. MASTER data

   effects due to missing data at overpass are incorrect values for the
   aerosol size distribution and column ozone. Changing the Junge
   parameter by 20% (a 0.7 change in Junge parameter), led to less than
   0.2% changes in the radiance. Assuming an uncertainty in ozone amount
   of 25% led to significant changes in only bands 2 and 3 with 2% and 3%
   changes, respectively. Thus, the overall uncertainty in these bands
   would be greater than those of bands with no ozone absorption. The
   reflectance of the surface was measured using an Analytic Spectral
   Devices FieldSpec FR. This instrument covers the wavelength range of
   350±2500 nm with output reported at 1 nm intervals. It uses three
   separate gratings to cover this spectral range. The first grating
   covers approxi- mately the range from 350 to 1000 nm at better than 1
   nm spectral resolution. The second and third gratings cover the 1000 to
   2000 nm and 2000 to 2500 nm spectral ranges, respectively, at 10 nm
   resolution. Measurements of the surface were made by transporting the
   FieldSpec across the test site and measuring upwelling radiance. The
   upwel- ling radiance is converted to reflectance by comparing the
   radiance to that from a panel of known reflectance. The reference for
   this work was a 46 cm2 monolithic piece of Spectralon. The 60 Â 60 m
   test site was divided into eight east±west sections. Forty sample
   spectra were collected within each section with each sample consisting

   results. Thus, the optical thicknesses shown in the figure are those
   due to aerosol scattering and absorption and a small amount of ozone
   absorption. As can be seen in the figure, the optical thickness shows a
   significant decrease early in the morning with an apparent leveling
   around 11 a.m. local standard time. Unfortunately, optical thickness
   data are not available for the actual overflight times and the optical
   thicknesses used to retrieve the aerosol size distribution were based
   on a 20-min average of data at the end of the collection. The lack of
   solar extinction measurements at the exact time of sensor overpass are
   not expected to be a significant source of uncertainty due to the high
   surface reflectance of the test site and low aerosol loading. To
   evaluate this effect, the aerosol optical thickness was doubled and the
   radiances at the sensor recomputed. This led to less than 0.7% change
   in radiance with the effect becoming smaller at longer wave- lengths.
   For the Ivanpah test site, this level of change in optical thickness
   has not been seen without significant amounts of blowing dust due to
   high-wind conditions. Since Fig. 3. Spectral optical thickness as a

   results from the boat traversing back and forth between the mouth and

   result have greater amplitude than the subsequent traverses. The
   radiometer measurements were made every second and the location of the
   boat at the time of the measurement was recorded by differential GPS,
   allowing the location of the boat at the time of the overpass to be
   determined. The differential GPS measurements are accurate to 1±2 m.
