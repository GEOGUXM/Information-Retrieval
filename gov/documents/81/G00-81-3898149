                      Project Schedule | Presidential Records Act Overview

   Our Mission

   The Clinton Presidential Materials Project's primary mission is the
   preservation of the Presidential records, personal and donated papers,
   and memorabilia of the Clinton Administration. All Presidential records
   of the Clinton White House are administered in accordance with the
   terms of the Presidential Records Act of 1978.

   Under the Act, all Presidential records are closed for the first five
   years following the end of a President's term. The Clinton Project has
   begun processing the Presidential record material to ensure that a wide
   variety of Presidential records will be readily available at the future
   Clinton Library on January 20, 2006, five years after the end of the
   Clinton Administration. Our goal is to have open 10% of the
   Presidential records. Records not yet processed and opened by us may be
   requested by filing a Freedom of Information (FOIA) request beginning
   January 20, 2006.

   Personal papers and other donated historical materials will be
   available to researchers according to the terms of the donor&s deed of
   gift. To expand the collections, we will actively solicit donations of
   personal papers from President and Mrs. Clinton, their families,
   friends, staff and associates.

   Our History (...So Far)

   In the Fall of 2000, we moved into a renovated building located at 1000
   LaHarpe Blvd., in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas. The facility is
   equipped with state-of-the-art security, fire safety, and temperature
   and humidity controls to protect the historical materials.

   Beginning in November, 2000, and continuing until January 20, 2001
   (inauguration day), approximately 76.8 million pages of paper
   documents, 75,000 museum artifacts, and 1.85 photographs were
   transported from Washington, D.C., to the Clinton Presidential
   Materials Project. These materials form the core collections of the
   Clinton Project and future Clinton Library.

   The William J. Clinton Presidential Center, which will include the
   Clinton Library, will be constructed with funds raised by the William
   J. Clinton Presidential Foundation. For more information about the
   Center visit the Foundation's website.
