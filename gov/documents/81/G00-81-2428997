   The Creation Of The Board
   The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) is an
   independent, scientific investigatory agency, not a regulatory or
   enforcement body. The CSB was created by the Clean Air Act Amendments
   of 1990. However, the Board was not funded and did not begin operations
   until January 1998.

   The Role Of The Board
   The agency is governed by its Board, consisting of five members
   appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. One of the
   Board members is to serve as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
   of the agency. Board members serve fixed terms of five years and may be

   Chemical Incident Data
   A number of federal agencies collect data on hazardous chemical
   incidents. However, no uniform definition of a "chemical incident"
   exists across the federal government, and the reporting requirements
   for individual programs have evolved over time.
