   Why is the temperature reported on the LLNL Weather page different from
   the temperature seen on a local thermometer ?[TOC]

     There are many reasons the temperature reported by the LLNL met
     tower may be different from that of other thermometers around the
     lab.
    1. Our temperatures are taken at 10 meters above the ground (a
       standard height) and other thermometers are often near the source
       of heat - the ground. We also have a thermistor at 2 meters. We may
       start displaying the values from this sensor. The difference
       between the two can be over 2 F on a sunny day.
    2. Our thermistors are assessed every three months and have to be
       within 0.5 F of a standard. They're usually closer than that. One
       of the most common styles of consumer thermometers is the bi-metal
       strip thermometer. These are notorious for being out of calibration
       and out of linearity.
    3. Our thermistors are ventilated by a fan. This way we get a true air
       temperature, not temperature elevated by buildup of heat. Other
       thermometers are usually not ventilated and are often between
       buildings that slow down the air.
    4. Even though a thermometer may be in the shade, it is often attached
       to a wall. The wall may conduct heat from places in the sun.

   Where is the LLNL meteorological tower?[TOC]

     The LLNL meteorological tower is located in the west buffer zone
     near the corner of Vasco and Patterson Pass Roads. The base of the
     tower is about 570 feet above mean sea level.

   Where is the Site 300 meteorological tower?[TOC]

     The Site 300 meteorological tower is located on a ridge near the
     center of the site. The base of the tower is about 1200 feet above
     mean sea level.

   The current weather page loads but is missing values. [TOC]

     There are a couple of reasons why the current weather page might
     load with missing values.
    1. The met tower may be offline. This can occur due to scheduled
       maintainence, emergency maintainence and hardware failure.
    2. The computers serving the data may not be able to communicate. This
       could be the result of hardware, software or network problems.
    3. There can be latency between the software that collects the data
       and the software that serves it to the web. The met data is
       scheduled to be collected on the quarter hour. The software that
       serves this data to the web tries to access the most recent data.
       Depending on the load on the machine, the data collection software
       may not run until sometime after scheduled. In these cases, the
       server software tries to access data that does not yet exist. In
       most cases, reloading the page a few minutes later resolves the
       problem.

   My browser hangs or crashes when I try to view metdat pages. [TOC]

     Your browser may hang or crash your machine if you are using a
     really old version of your browser. Most of the metdat pages use
     javascript which can cause problems for older browsers. For example,
     versions of Netscape Navigator prior to v2.2 for the Macintosh
     behave badly when they encounter javascript.

   What is Sigma Theta? [TOC]

     Sigma Theta is measured by our wind vane and is related to
     horizontal turbulence. Mathematically it is the standard deviation
     of the vane position. This calculation is tricky because the vane
     can swing in a circle (it uses polar coordinates).

     At LLNL we take a reading of the wind vane every second. Every 15
     minutes the data logger takes the 900 readings to calculate an
     average wind direction and sigma theta. The dynamics of our Met One
     020 wind vanes are well known and within specifications set down by
     EPA for damping ratio, starting threshold, and distance constant.

     We use Sigma Theta to estimate the potential for the atmosphere to
     spread a plume. The EPA provides guidance to calculate a common
     plume dispersion index (Pasquill Stability Class) from measurements
     of wind speed and sigma theta.

   What is Solar Radiation? [TOC]

     Solar Radiation is measured by a simple photocell pointed directly
     up. The voltage from this sensor is directly proportional to the
     sun's energy striking the a horizontal surface. The photocell we use
     is sensitive to a broad band of wavelengths.

   What is Stability Class? [TOC]

     Stability Class is used to determine the spread of a plume. There
     are accepted equations for the width and height of a plume given the
     distance from the source and the Stability class. Surprisingly, wind
     speed is not included in these functions. To estimate stability
     class we use a method suggested by the EPA. The wind speed and sigma
     theta are combined in this method. There are other methods for
     estimating stability class. An old one uses wind speed and percent
     cloud cover. Another method uses solar radiation and wind speed in
     the daytime, and vertical temperature difference and wind speed at
     night. There are six Pasquill Stability categories: A through F. The
     Unstable classes (A, B, and C) occur during the daytime. The Stable
     classes (E and F) only occur at night. The Neutral class can occur
     during the day or night. Class A is the Very Unstable and
     corresponds to hot, calm days and leads to the greatest amount of
     dispersion. A plume of effluent is broken up and spread wide with A
     Stability. Class D is neutral. It corresponds to windy days or the
     transition times of dawn and dusk. This is the most frequently
     occurring stability class. Class F is Very Stable and corresponds to
     nights with low winds. A plume experiencing F Stability will feature
     very little dispersion. Here is a link to a short on-line tutorial
     on many aspects of Air Quality: http://www.shodor.org/metweb/ or
     more directly to the part about atmospheric dispersion and
     stability: http://www.shodor.org/metweb/session6/stable.html

   Is Wind Direction relative to true north or magnetic north? [TOC]

     The wind direction values presented are all relative to True North.
     We do use a compass to orient the wind vane, but we do take into
     account the local declination angle.

   Why are there discrepencies between the temperature reported by these
   web pages and the web page at http://www.llnl.gov/llnl-bin/weather ?
   [TOC]

     The web page at http://www.llnl.gov/llnl-bin/weather uses the
     instruments on the met tower located at 2m above the ground. Our web
     page http://www-metdat.llnl.gov/cgi-pub/metdat/CurrentWeather.cgi
     uses the instruments located at 10m above the ground, which is the
     regulatory standard. By using our weather reporting facility (
     http://www-metdat.llnl.gov/setup_report.html ) you can view the
     temperature readings from the 2m package. However, there is still a
     discrepency between our sites of at most 1 Â°. This reported
     difference is due to rounding. Our site truncates the fractional
     portion of temperatures reported in the farenheit scale. The other
     site uses rounding.

   Why is reported solar radiation sometimes greater on a partly cloudy
   day than on a clear day? [TOC]

     We use a Licor photometer to measure solar radiation. This sensor is
     sensitive to the short wave radiation. Clouds reflect these short
     waves towards the sensor. So, when the geometry is just right, white
     clouds will add to direct sunlight.

   Why do the reports seem to be an hour behind the current time? [TOC]

     During daylight savings time, the data will appear to be an hour
     off. All reports use PST as the time basis to ensure reports are
     consistent even when the reporting period includes one of the time
     change dates.

   Is the reported barometric pressure adjusted to sea level? [TOC]

     The pressure presented on our web pages is adjusted to sea level.
     This is common practice and makes it possible to compare data
     between stations.
     To adjust back to absolute atmospheric pressure, multiply the sea
     level pressure by: =((288-0.0065*ElevFeet/3.28)/288)^5.256 where
     ElevFeet is the elevation in feet. You can see that ElevFeet/3.28 is
     the elevation in meters.
     The sensor is usually accurate to within 3 mb. If you need more
     accuracy than this, you'll have to get a mercury barometer and take
     your own measurements.
     You can get data from our Site 300 barometer from our web site.
     Also, you can get barometric data from the Livermore Airport (KLVK),
     Oakland (KOAK), and Stockton (KSCK) here. You might have to start at
     the University of Wyoming home page and click on Weather and Surface
     Observations.
