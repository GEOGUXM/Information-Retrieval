Materials Technical Advisory Committee

Minutes of June 13, 2001 Meeting



OPEN SESSION


   1.      Introduction of attendees

   2.      Comments by the public: none

   3.      Status report on proposed revision to Category II of the
   Missile Technology Control Regime for composites and composite
   production equipment. (Jeff Tripp)
   It was proposed that prepreg and fiber winding machines would be
   controlled only if motions were coordinated in five or more axes
   instead of the present three axes, but controls on carbon fiber
   production would be extended by removing a restriction on item 6B1d to
   straining of the fiber during heating.  BXA objected to the change as
   this would control many currently uncontrolled furnaces.  BXA also
   objected to a change in 8C2 that had the effect of extending MTCR
   controls to matrices exhibiting a glass transition temperature >145C.
   This change would have extended the controls to countries that have no
   missile program but do make commercial composite products and would
   have precluded US participation in the China market due to the
   Presidential Certification Requirement for commodities controlled for
   Missile Technology reasons.

   The Open Session was adjourned.
