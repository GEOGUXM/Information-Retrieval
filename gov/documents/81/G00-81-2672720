   Postdoctoral Fellowships

   Postdoctoral Fellowship appointments with SAICs research programs are
   awarded throughout the year to recent recipients of a Ph.D., M.D., or
   equivalent degree in the biological, chemical, or biochemical sciences.
   Candidates are encouraged to apply well in advance of their
   availability date.

   Appointments are made for 1 year, renewable annually with the
   supervisors approval, for up to 3 years. Based on performance, there
   are additional 1-year appointments also renewable for up to 3 years as
   a Senior Postdoctoral Fellow. Total maximum time in the SAIC Frederick
   Postdoctoral Program should not exceed six years.

   The Postdoctoral Fellowship Program has set stipend (annual pay)
   guidelines. These guidelines are applied to all Postdoctoral Fellows,
   based on their degree date. We also provide a comprehensive benefits
   program, including medical, dental, life, long-term, short-term, and
   accident insurances as well as vacation and sick leave. We also offer a
   401(k) savings plan and stock purchase programs.

   SAIC Frederick can sponsor foreign national Postdoctoral Fellows
   through a J-1 visa, depending on the candidates individual
   circumstances.

   Postdoctoral Fellows will be individually selected by the Principal
   Investigators of SAIC Frederick. To apply, send a letter describing
   your research interests, a curriculum vitae, and the names and
   addresses of three references to research program(s) of interest, c/o:
