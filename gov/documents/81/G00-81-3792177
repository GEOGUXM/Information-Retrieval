   USGS
   Water Resources of Florida
   Mission Statement

   The mission of the Water Resources Division, which supports the overall
   mission of the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological
   Survey, is to provide the hydrologic information and understanding
   needed for the best use and management of the Nation's water resources
   for the benefit of the people of the United States.

   To accomplish its mission, the Water Resources Division in cooperation
   with State and local governments and other Federal agencies:
     * Systematically collects data needed for the continuing
       determination and evaluation of the quantity, quality, and use of
       the Nation's water resources.
     * Conducts analytical and interpretive water-resources appraisals to
       describe the occurence, availability, and physical, chemical, and
       biological characteristics of surface and ground water and their
       interrelationship.
     * Conducts supportive basic and problem-oriented research in
       hydraulics, hydrology, and related fields of science and
       engineering to improve the basis for field investigations and
       measurement techniques and to understand hydrologic systems
       sufficiently well to predict quantitatively their response to
       stress, either natural or manmade.
     * Disseminates water data and the results of investigations and
       research through reports, maps, computerized information services,
       and other forms of public releases.
     * Coordinates the activities of all Federal agencies in the
       acquisition of certain water data.
     * Provides scientific and technical assistance in hydrologic fields
       to State, local, and other Federal agencies, to licensees of the
       Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and, on behalf of the U.S.
       Department of State, to international agencies.
     * Acquires, develops, and disseminates information on water-related
       natural hazards such as droughts, floods, landslides, land
       subsidence, mudflows, and volcanoes.
     * Administers the provisions of the Water Resources Research Act of
       1984, which include the State Water Resources Research Institutes
       and the Research Grants and Contracts programs.
     * Supports the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of
       1969 and manages Geological Survey conduct of natural-resources
       surveys in response to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
       Compensation, and Liability Act (Superfund Act) of 1980.

   Authority for carrying out this mission is derived from legislation of
   1879, which created the Geological Survey, and legislation of 1888 and
   1894, which provided for gaging of streams and determining the Nation's
   water supply. Congressional appropriations have been made annually
   since 1894 for gaging streams and performing other functions relating
   to water resources. In 1964, the Geological Survey's mission was
   broadened to include the role of lead agency in the coordination of the
   activities of all Federal agencies in the acquisition of certain water
   data. This responsibility was assigned to the Department of the
   Interior by the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-67.
