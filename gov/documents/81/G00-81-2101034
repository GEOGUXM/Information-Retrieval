                     Space Scientists Online Description

   The NASA Office of Space Science (OSS) conducts research and activities
   in four main areas:
     * Search for Origins
     * Sun-Earth Connection
     * Structure and Evolution of the Universe
     * Solar System Exploration

   The Space Scientists Online super-project is a partnership with OSS to
   provide the educational community with new and exciting information
   from space sciences as well as collect relevant information from
   previous space science projects such as Online from Jupiter and Live
   from the Hubble Space Telescope.

   This project will feature material from previous projects presented in
   a new light and augmented with new events, background information and
   online interactions from OSS. We will conduct chats and Learning
   Technology Channel events. Stay tuned to this page for more information
   as the project gets rolling.

   The Space Scientists Online page will include:

     * Project News:
          + a welcome and some background for first time visitors;
          + the most recent updates are also available.
     * Featured Events: project segments to stimulate your students
       including live LTC events.
     * Biographical Information: learn about the men and women of the OSS
       to help students relate to the project at a human level.
       Biographies from previous projects will also be provided.
     * Field Journals: entries from space science personnel from previous
       projects describe their day-to-day activities and their particular
       role in the project. These reports will help students understand
       the diversity of people and skills that are needed for success in a
       modern science project.
     * Chats: talk to space science experts via the Web.
     * Q and A: view q&a from previous OSS projects and ask questions of
       Mars experts.
     * Background Information: learn about the Office of Space Science,
       NASA's space science mission as well as tidbits of information from
       previous and existing OSS projects.
