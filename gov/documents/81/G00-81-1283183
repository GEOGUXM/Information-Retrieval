   I am very excited to have the opportunity to provide information to my
   constituents and to the general public through this internet site. As a
   Member of Congress, providing information and services to my
   constituents is an important part of my job, and I hope that using the
   information highway will make it easier for you to keep abreast of the
   goings-on in Congress, in New York City, and in my office -- all from
   your keyboard. Of course, you are welcome to visit or call my offices
   at any time, and my staff will be happy to help or answer questions.

   If you live on the East Side of Manhattan or in Astoria or Long Island
   City, Queens, you are most likely my constituent. My district, NY14,
   also includes part of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and all of
   Roosevelt Island. I think our district is one of the most diverse and
   exciting places anyone could hope to represent in Congress.

   Thank you for taking the time to visit my web site. Please don't
   hesitate to contact any of my offices if my staff or I can be of
   assistance.

   Sincerely,
   [signature.gif]
   CAROLYN B. MALONEY
   Member of Congress
