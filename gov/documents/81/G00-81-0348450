   Urban forests reduce energy consumption, improve air and water quality
   as well as provide many other benefits.

      The purpose of the Urban and Community Forestry Program is to create
      sustainable urban forests to help improve the quality of urban
      environments and the quality of life. Program staff work to:

     Arrest the decline of urban forests through proper management and
   planting of trees in communities.

     Improve and encourage employment opportunities associated with urban
   forestry activities.

     Maximize the potential use of tree and vegetation cover to reduce
   energy consumption, improve air and water quality, and produce an
   assortment of products.

     Encourage coordination of federal, state, and local efforts to
   promote citizen participation in the development and implementation of
   urban forestry activities.

   The structure and delivery of the program is built upon cooperative
   relationships between agencies, and contractual agreements with
   nonprofit organizations. Participating groups include the Urban Forest
   Ecosystems Institute (UFEI) which was developed by the Natural
   Resources Management department faculty within Cal Poly San Luis Obispo
   to address the increasing need for improved management of urban forests
   in California, the California ReLeaf organization, an association of
   non-profit tree planting groups, and the California Urban Forest
   Council which focuses on technical and institutional issues of urban
   forest management.
