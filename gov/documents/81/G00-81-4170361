   Nuclear Energy Research Initiative
   Goals & Objectives

   The Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI) program sponsors new and
   innovative scientific and engineering research and development to
   address the key issues affecting the future of nuclear energy, and to
   preserve our Nation's nuclear science and technology infrastructure. In
   accomplishing this primary goal, the following objectives have been
   established for the NERI Program:
     * Develop advanced reactor and fuel cycle concepts and scientific
       breakthroughs in nuclear technology to overcome the principal
       scientific and technical obstacles to expand future use of nuclear
       energy in the United States, including issues involving nuclear
       material proliferation, unfavorable economics, and nuclear waste
       disposition.
     * Advance the state of U.S. nuclear technology to maintain a
       competitive position in overseas markets and a future domestic
       market
     * Promote and maintain a nuclear science and engineering
       infrastructure to meet future technical challenges.

   Fulfillment of these objectives will provide advanced technologies that
   will allow nuclear energy to become a significant global source of
   electricity in the 21st century. In addition, it will allow the United
   States to retain its technical competence and human resource and
   knowledge base and strengthen its world leadership position in nuclear
   energy technology and the underlying sciences.
