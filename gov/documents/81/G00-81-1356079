Commercial Space Centers

   Commercial Space Centers, located at academic institutions and funded
   by NASA, develop industry partners to pursue specific areas of
   commercial research. The industry partners generate a demand for doing
   business in space and help fund a portion of the operations and
   research.

   The Centers are subject to several types of review and appraisal. One
   measure used is the interest of industry, which is evaluated by the
   number of industry partners and funding. Another measure checks
   progress against previously established milestones. Periodic checks are
   made by an outside source, such as the National Academy of Public
   Administration, to provide an independent assessment of the Centers and
   their performance.

   Currently, NASA sponsors 17 Commercial Space Centers, with 11 of them
   operating through the Space Product Development Program. As new areas
   of commercial interest are identified, new Centers will be established,
   while other Centers may be disbanded if industry involvement wanes. The
   current Commercial Space Centers are:
