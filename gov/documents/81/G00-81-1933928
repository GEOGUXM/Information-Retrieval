                                            Sustainable Building Practices
    Sustainable or green building practices cover all aspects of building,
                                                                including:
     * land preparation
     * materials selection
     * life-cycle of the building (construction, operation and
       maintenance, demolition)

                           Sustainable building includes such practices as
     * job-site recycling of construction materials
     * native vegetation landscapes
     * stream and wetland protection and restoration
     * natural drainage
     * energy and water efficiency
     * low toxicity materials
     * recycled materials
     * reduced use of land and materials
     * design for re-use

   Green Building & Salmon Restoration

   With the federal government having listed chinook salmon as threatened,
   local developers and builders will notice an increase in inspections of
   building sites and a small increase in permit fees. New inspectors will
   look for environmentally sensitive site development and grading,
   including wetland preservation, stream protection, erosion prevention,
   natural drainage, and native plants.

   Meadowbrook Community Center is an example of a site development that
   included salmon habitat restoration on a creek that runs through the
   site.

   To restore salmon, the local building industry will be more
   sophisticated in the environmental management and overall
   sustainability--of building sites. Even water and energy use in the
   building itself impact salmon since the Northwest relies on hydropower
   and surface water for building uses.
