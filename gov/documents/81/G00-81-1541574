     The Polar Satellite Precipitation Data Centre (PSPDC) is responsible
     for the processing, storage, and distribution of oceanic monthly
     rainfall from data collected by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager
     (SSM/I) on board the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)
     satellites. Microwave-based oceanic monthly rain-rates are estimated
     for the period July 1987 through the present (except December 1987
     during which there was insufficient data). Oceanic rain rate
     products are generated for 2.5° latitude by 2.5° longitude grid
     boxes between 65° North and 65° South latitude as well as for 5°
     latitude by 5° longitude grid boxes between 50° North and 50° South.

     NASA is working closely in coordination with and providing support
     to national and international programs such as the U.S. Global
     Climate Research Program (USGCRP), the International
     Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP), and the World Climate Research
     Program (WCRP). The activities at the Polar Satellite Precipitation
     Centre (PSPDC) represent NASA's contribution to the Global
     Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) of the Global Energy and
     Water Exchange Experiment (GEWEX), which is sponsored by the World
     Climate Research Program (WCRP).

     Members of the PSPDC are also supporting the development of monthly
     rainfall algorithm for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission
     (TRMM) using data collected from the Microwave Imager on board the
     TRMM satellite (the TRMM Microwave Imager, or TMI). Rainfall
     products developed by the TRMM can be used to cross check the GPCP
     rainfall products.
