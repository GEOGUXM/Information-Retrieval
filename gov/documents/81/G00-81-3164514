   On My Mind

   200l International Aviation
   Training Symposium
   by Bill Traylor, AMA-1

      Bill Traylor, AMA-1 When we began the planning and preparation for the
      second International Aviation Training Symposium, the question we asked
      ourselves was, "How could we possibly equal the success of the
      inaugural IATS 1999?" Event sponsorship, recruitment of speakers,
      location and logistics for the event, volunteer support, and
      International participation were just some of the challenges facing the
      team. We had a lot of expectations to live up to, but as usual, the
      Academy team not only met the challenge, they overwhelmingly surpassed
      the challenge!

      Over 330 delegates, exhibitors and speakers from 42 countries met in
      Oklahoma City at the Myriad Convention Center on August 28-31 to
      participate in IATS 2001. Aviation leaders, training specialists,
      airline operations and training management personnel, government air
      transport officials and aerospace industry experts met to address
      global aviation training issues affecting each country at its own level
      of need. The IATS objective was to take advantage of training
      technology, find ways to share resources, fund new training initiatives
      and jointly tackle worldwide aviation training challenges.

      IATS 2001 offered a unique international aviation training event that
      featured projects and solutions for worldwide aviation training
      development and delivery. It successfully promoted aviation safety,
      security and system efficiency through delegate interaction in a
      variety of aviation training presentations, workshops and
      demonstrations. The focus was on subject matter that enhanced the theme
      of "Aviation Training Challenges Worldwide."

      The participants enjoyed the social events during the evenings of the
      IATS. Governor Frank Keating gave the attendees an Oklahoma Welcome
      Tuesday night during the Welcome Reception. The Oklahoma Country and
      Western International Banquet on Wednesday evening was a huge success
      among the delegates and exhibitors. The International Pro Rodeo
      Association provided Miss Rodeo 2001 and the 2000 number one and number
      two All-Around World Champion Cowboys, Jett and Cord McCoy. The Ward
      Family Trick Ropers and American Indian Inter-Tribal Dancers and
      Singers known as the Oklahoma Fancy Dancers performed to the delight of
      the audience.

      The IATS delegates, exhibitors and speakers all expressed their
      appreciation for the Academy's role in hosting such a premier event and
      had many compliments on the quality of the symposium. They commented on
      the attention paid to all of the detail and how smoothly and
      professionally the symposium ran.

      On October 18, the Academy hosted a reception at the ARB cafeteria to
      thank all of the Academy and MMAC volunteers and to show our
      appreciation for all of their support. I would like to again take this
      opportunity to express my appreciation for all of your support in
      making IATS 2001 such a tremendous success. Thanks to the many
      volunteers who contributed your time and expertise. It is truly a
      reflection of all of your hard work and dedication.
