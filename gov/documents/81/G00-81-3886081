                             About This Website

   As a key step in the transition to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
   Services (CMS) from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), we
        are building a user-driven, easy-to-use website, cms.hhs.gov.

    Over the next several months, we will be adding more and more content
     and services to the site, so check back often. Part of this process
    will include migrating content from our old website, www.hcfa.gov, to
    this site. We will make this process as seamless as possible for our
                                  visitors.

   In the interim, you will find that a large number of links on this site
        will take you to specific pages on the www.hcfa.gov website.

                          Content Reuse and Linking

   All content on cms.hhs.gov, unless specifically stated otherwise, is in
      the public domain and may be reused without explicit approval or
       permission. However, linking rather than copying information is
   strongly encouraged to prevent the distribution of dated or inaccurate
                                  content.

                               Privacy Policy
    The privacy of our customers is important to CMS. We understand that
       visitors to cms.hhs.gov need to be in control of their personal
                                information.

                               System Security
   Information about the security of this website and the appropriate uses
       of the privacy of our customers is important to the Centers for
     Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). We understand that visitors to
    cms.hhs.gov and medicare.gov need to be in control of their personal
                                information.

                            Website Accessibility
   The CMS website makes extensive use of modern web standards, including
       HTML 4, Cascading Stylesheets, and ECMAScript. To get the best
      experience using our website, we recommend using a modern browser
        (version 5 or higher). However, cms.hhs.gov will remain fully
      functional with all of the above features turned off. CMS remains
    committed to promoting the goals of the Web Accessibility Initiative
   and Section 508. This includes accessibility for visitors who are using
      assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) as well as numerous
   platforms and devices (e.g., handhelds, laptops, text browsers, etc.).
