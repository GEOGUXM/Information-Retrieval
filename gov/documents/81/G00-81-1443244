                        The GFO File Transfer System

   The GFO File Transfer System (FTS) is designed to automate the handling
   of GFO CALVAL data. It is designed to operate autonomously with user
   intervention at a minimum.

Capabilities

     The FTS will "push" data to clients via an automated FTP.

     The FTS will allow clients to "pull" data via FTP from an online
   repository.

File Naming Conventions

   The FTS works only with all-lowercase filenames. The FTS automatically
   translates upper-case filenames to an all lower-case equivalent. The
   FTS uses a unique file-naming convention to determine what to do with
   files that are processed within the system. Each unique type of file
   used by a project must have a filename beginning with a unique
   4-character code designated as "filetype". This "filetype" code must be
   assigned to the filetype by the FTS administrator. Files without an
   appropriate filetype will cause an error condition within the FTS.

Incoming Files

   A client may introduce a file into the system by transferring the file
   into the "inbox" (/in) via FTP. Criteria for submitting a file to the
   FTS via FTP are:

     Files must be put in incoming directory (/in)

     Filenames are case-sensitive and must conform to FTS file naming
   conventions.

   The FTS checks each project inbox once per minute. If it sees a file in
   the inbox, it creates a lock file containing the current size in bytes
   of the file. The next time it checks the inbox, it compares the current
   size of the file with the size saved in the lock file. If the two
   match, the FTS assumes the file has completed transfer and moves the
   file. If the file sizes do not match, the new size is put into the lock
   file and the process repeats. Do not be alarmed if files disappear out
   of the inbox; the FTS is just doing its job.

Outgoing Files

   There are two basic methods by which files may be sent to clients. A
   file may be automatically "pushed" via FTP or it may be put in the
   "outbox" (/out) for "pull" retrieval. The FTP "push" mechanism is
   somewhat persistent. It can discern whether a file has been transferred
   correctly and will keep trying for up to three times if the transfer is
   not successful. After a third unsuccessful try, the FTS will send email
   to the FTS operator informing him of an error condition. The FTS will
   keep a two-week (TBD?) repository of data for the GFO CALVAL project.
   In order to ease client "pulls", the FTS will, on a daily basis, create
   a text file listing new files which are entered into the repository.
   The text file will be named in the format:

        newfiles.YYYY_MM_DD.txt

Security

     The FTS is built upon rooted FTP directories. Clients will not have
   access to the remainder of the file system.

     Clients will be allowed FTP-only access to the server. Telnet
   services will not be permitted.

     Passwords will be provided to each client. Password changes will be
   handled locally to insure good password selection and password change
   compliance. Multiple clients may be assigned the same userid and
   password, if deemed appropriate by the FTS administrators.

     Clients must supply the FTS administrator with the hostnames and IP
   addresses of machines which need access to the FTS before attempting
   their first connection.

Logging

   All actions performed by this system are logged in a log directory. The
   administrator can check this logfile if problems occur. A sample
   logfile is shown below:
