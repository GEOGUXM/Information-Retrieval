               What is the California Department of Insurance?

   Overseeing the industry and protecting the state's insurance consumers
   is the responsibility of the California Department of Insurance (CDI).
   Insurance is a $80 billion-a-year industry in California.  The CDI
   regulates, investigates and audits insurance business to ensure that
   companies remain solvent and meet their obligations to insurance
   policyholders.  CDI issues Certificates of Authority to insurance and
   title companies seeking admittance into the California market; and
   licenses agents, brokers, solicitors and bail bonds agents domiciled in
   the state.

   CDI enforces the laws of the California Insurance Code and promulgates
   regulations to implement these laws. Laws and regulations are enforced
   by the staff in the Consumer Services and Communications Bureau,
   Enforcement Branch, Fraud Division, Rate Regulation Bureau, Financial
   Surveillance Branch, Legal Unit, Policy, Research and Special Projects
   and the Executive Branch.

   The Consumer Communications Bureau, staffed by insurance experts,
   provides immediate assistance to callers whenever possible. CDI's
   statewide toll-free hotline (800-927-HELP*) serves as an information
   clearinghouse for consumers with insurance-related questions or
   problems. The CDI responds to thousands of consumer requests for
   assistance and complaints received each month. Acting on these
   requests, the CDI protects consumers by investigating and prosecuting
   companies and licensees accused of insurance code violations, including
   fraud.
