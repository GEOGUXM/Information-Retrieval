   Health care is an issue of paramount importance to all people,
   particularly to people with disabilities. Today, there are over 54
   million Americans with disabilities, a full 20 percent of the U.S.
   population. Almost half of these individuals have a severe disability,
   affecting their ability to see, hear, walk or perform other basic
   functions of life. In addition, there are over 25 million family
   caregivers and millions more who provide aid and assistance to people
   with disabilities. New Freedom Initiative
