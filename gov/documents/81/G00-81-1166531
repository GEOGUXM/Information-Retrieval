   Announcing the "ITS Performance Measures and Evaluation Techniques"
   Seminar In TEA-21, all projects that receive federal-aid funding under
   the ITS Deployment Program are required to conduct a self-evaluation
   (unless they are among the small percentage of projects selected for a
   national evaluation) Does your agency or firm need assistance on how to
   conduct a self-evaluation? Are you a public sector employee who would
   like to learn how evaluation can improve the way you deliver ITS
   products and services to travelers in your area? Are you an ITS
   consultant who would like to break in to the rapidly growing market of
   ITS evaluation? If you answered "yes" to any of these questions and
   you're planning on attending the Institute for Transportation Engineers
   (ITE) Annual Meeting August 19-22, 2001 in Chicago, you should consider
   signing up for the "ITS Performance Measures and Evaluation Techniques"
   seminar. This half-day professional development seminar will be
   presented Sunday, August 19, 8:00am - 12:00 noon, prior to the ITE
   Annual Meeting. The seminar, which is sponsored by the Benefits,
   Evaluation and Costs (BEC) Committee of ITS America (ITSA), will teach
   participants: (1) how to conduct an evaluation of an ITS project and
   (2) how practitioners can benefit from the feedback evaluation
   provides. The fee to attend this seminar is $75. You don't need to be a
   member of ITE or even a registrant at the ITE Annual Meeting to
   participate. A mail or fax registration form is available at
   http://www.ite.org/AnnualMeeting/regform.pdf More information about the
   ITE Annual Meeting, as well as online registration, is available at

   able to take advantage of a great opportunity to learn more about ITS
   evaluation!!
