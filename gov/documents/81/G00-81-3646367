   The primary objective of the NASA Advanced Air Transportation
   Technologies project is to fully explore the possibilities of the "Free
   Flight" concept. AATT products will enable substantial increases in the
   effectiveness of national and global air transportation systems. These
   increases will be achieved by developing and testing automation aids
   that can assist in the decision-making process among pilots, air
   traffic controllers, and dispatchers.

   return to the projects and programs page. ACSYNT AirCraft SYNThesis is
   a computer program used for the conceptual design of new civil and
   military aircraft and for analyzing existing aircraft. The program
   allows an engineer to perform trade studies, sensitivities, and
   optimizations. Analysis modules include aerodynamics, weights,
   propulsion, mission performance, geometry, takeoff and landing,
   stability and control, and economics. ACSYNT was originally created at
   NASA Ames Research Center in the early `70s and has been continuously
   enhanced and updated from that time forward.

   projects and programs page.
       BAD-Web (Basic Aircraft Design Web) is an informational and
   educational service created by the Systems Analysis Branch. We operate
   BAD-Web to give some rudimentary insight into the art and science of
   aircraft design. While we have purposely limited the scope of BAD-Web
   to ensure quick results, it should demonstrate the kind of trade-offs
   and decisions that aircraft designers face on a daily basis. These
   types of studies and analyses are just one facet of what we do in our
   Branch.

   characteristics of flight crews; formulate principles and design
   criteria for future aviation environments; evaluate new and
   contemporary air traffic control procedures; and develop new training
   and simulation techniques required by the continued. technical
   evolution of flight systems.

   link to Galileo web site, use back button on browser to return to the
   projects and programs page.     The Galileo Project is a NASA unmanned
   mission to explore the planet Jupiter and its surrounding moons and
   magnetosphere. The spacecraft, which started its journey on October 18,
   1989 with the launch of the Space Shuttle Atlantis, consisted of an
   atmospheric entry probe (Galileo Probe) designed to enter Jupiter`s
   atmosphere, and an orbiter (Galileo Orbiter) designed to orbit the
   planet and observe Jupiter, its moons, and radiation belts. This
   homepage is devoted to background information and scientific results
   from the Galileo atmospheric entry probe portion of the mission.

   return to the projects and programs page.     The most recent Orbital
   Science Pegasus Mission to deliver a Brazilian Satellite to earth orbit
   and to fly a NASA Hypersonics experiment was a huge success. The
   payload was placed at the desired orbit and the NASA Glove assembly
   transmitted hypersonic flight data that will aid in the design of
   future high-speed vehicles. There has not been a flight to validate
   computer code solutions since the X-15 flew some 30 years ago. Several
   technological advancements in materials, construction, and electronic
   data collection/transmission were made in the effort to build and fly
   the glove.

   B1, use back button on browser to return to the projects and programs
   page.     NASA Ames, in conjunction with small companies, has been
   developing new Ultra High Temperature Ceramics (UHTCs). We believe the
   UHTC's will enable sharp leading edges for space vehicles. We have
   successfully tested these materials in the ground-based arc jet
   facilities, and the first flight demonstration is scheduled for May,
   1997. We are working with Sandia National Laboratory and the U.S. Air
   Force to integrate a UHTC nosetip onto a reentry vehicle.

   to return to the projects and programs page.     The Surface Movement
   Advisor (SMA) is a joint Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) project to help
   current airport facilities operate more efficiently.
   The SMA system integrates the airline schedules, gate information,
   flight plans, radar feeds and runway configuration (departure split and
   landing direction). This integrated information is then re-transmitted
   over the network system and shared between the key players at the
   airport.

   STARDUST has been selected by NASA as a candidate mission for the
   Discovery Program of highly focused deep space missions with
   exceptional science return at lowest possible cost.

   LOGO for Terminal Area Productivity (TAP) project.     The Terminal
   Area Productivity (TAP) project will increase the capacity of existing
   major US airports that experience delays in non-visual, or instrument
   meteorological conditions. TAP will increase capacity and reduce delays
   by reducing spacing requirements between aircraft approaching an
   airport and by expediting ground operations while meeting all FAA
   safety guidelines.
   The mission of the TAP project is to achieve the same level of airport
   capacity and safety associated with clear-weather operation during
   instrument meteorological conditions.

   rocket based Single Stage to Orbit (SSTO) Reusable Launch Vehicle
   (RLV). The goal of the X-33 program is to reduce the business and
   technical risks by the end of the decade such that private industry can
   build and operate the next generation reusable launch vehicle. The
   Lockheed Martin Skunk Works X-33 concept uses a lifting body shape
   coupled with an aerospike rocket engine concept to propel the vehicle
   over Mach 15. The X-33 will simulate the ascent and re-entry
   environments of the full-scale RLV. The X-33 is scheduled to complete
   its first flight by March of 1999. Edwards Air Force Base in California
   will be the launch site for the X-33.
