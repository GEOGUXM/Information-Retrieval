                       The Latest Cool Image from SPC

   This will be updated on irregular occasion as I find (and have time and
       opportunity to capture) "cool" images: interesting, beautiful,
     educational, and/or unusual radar, satellite, or analytical imagery
    dealing with any weather subject. I hope you enjoy this little page.

                           "X" Marks the Distrails

    Distrails, short for "dissipation trails," are evaporation paths cut
     through cloud layers by the heat of a jet airplane's exhaust. Their
    counterparts, contrails, are more commonly seen cloud streaks left in
    the wake of planes by cooling of water vapor in their exhaust plumes.
    Unlike contrails, which require the bitterly cold temperatures of the
   upper troposphere, distrails can form in one of two ways: in relatively
      warm, low clouds made of water droplets, or as in this case, from
    glaciation (icing) of a thin supercooled middle to high level clouds.

    Note how each distrail contains a white stripe sandwiched between two
    dark ones. The glaciation process makes the stripe of cirrus (white),
                 leaving a cloud-free swath on either side.

     Like contrails, distrails tend to expand through dispersion as they
     move away from the track where they were made, becoming many times
       larger than the plane itself. That was the case here, where the
   criscrossing trails became big enough to be detected in 1 km resolution
    visible satellite pictures. The evolution of these trails is seen in
                        this 1.8 MB javascript loop.

   Thanks to Steve Corfidi (SPC) for assistance with documentation of this
                                   event.
