     The Public Employment Relations Board issues a written decision or
     order in every case where a party appeals the decision of a Board
     agent. Decisions of the Board itself are public documents and may be
     relied upon by the parties as precedent in any matter pending before
     the Board. PERB has developed a PERB Decision Index containing
     summaries of the holdings of each Board decision, which may be
     accessed through the PERB Decision Search Engine. (See also Summary
     of Rulings in Unfair Practice Cases.) PERB also maintains a numeric
     list of its decisions and precedential court decisions that are
     included in the index. A separate Representation Index is also
     available through the PERB Decision Search Engine. Individuals may
     purchase copies of Board decisions at the Headquarters Office of the
     Public Employment Relations Board, 1031 18th Street, Sacramento,
     95814. The price is $5 per decision and $4 for postage and handling.

     Decisions of the Board are also published, with an index, in the
     Public Employee Reporter for California (PERC), a publication of the
     Labor Relations Press. Copies of the PERC are available in many
     public and university libraries throughout California.

     Board decisions also are available for review by members of the
     public at the agency's Sacramento, Oakland and Los Angeles regional
     offices.

     In addition to the three PERB regional offices, copies of all
     decisions of the PERB are maintained at certain public depository
     libraries in California. Public depository libraries agree to
     provide adequate facilities for the shelving and use of State of
     California publications and render reasonable service without charge
     to qualified patrons.
