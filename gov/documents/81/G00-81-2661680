                       ICCVAM world and sun logo

                            Guidance Document on Using In Vitro
                          Data to Estimate In Vivo Starting Doses
                                    for Acute Toxicity

          Based on Recommendations from an International Workshop
Organized by the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the
Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM)
and the
National Toxicology Program (NTP) Interagency Center for
the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM)
