Remote Access

   In the traditional workplace everyone travels to a single location and
   works a predetermined schedule. At the end of the workday, they, along
   with millions of others, make the journey home. In today's society the
   rules have changed. Options like workplace alternatives and
   telecommuting have created new opportunities. The following are a few
   advantages of telecommuting.
     * Part-time traditional office environment
     * Work from home or telecommuting centers near home--no heavy traffic
     * Save $$$ spent for bus-fare, parking, gasoline, insurance, etc.
     * Spend more time with your family
     * Environmental improvement
     * Stress reduction
