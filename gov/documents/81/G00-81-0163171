ASSURANCE/COMPLIANCE


   Assurance jpg
   The Assurance/Compliance Program is responsible for monitoring
   institutional compliance with the PHS regulation on research
   misconduct. The Assurance Program ensures that PHS research and
   research training support is awarded only to eligible institutions. The
   names of institutions that have an assurance are maintained in a
   database that is automatically run against applications submitted by
   institutions to determine funding eligibility. A computer bar prevents
   the processing of awards to ineligible institutions. An institution is
   eligible when it has an assurance on file with ORI stating that is has
   developed and will comply with an administrative process for responding
   to allegations of research misconduct in PHS-supported research that
   complies with the PHS regulation. An institution establishes an
   assurance when an official signs the face-page of the PHS grant
   application form or when the institution files a separate assurance
   form. Once established, institutions maintain their assurance by
     * filing the Annual Report on Possible Research Misconduct,
     * submitting their policy for responding to allegations of research
       misconduct for review when requested by ORI,
     * revising their policy when requested by ORI to bring the policy
       into compliance with the PHS regulation, and complying with the PHS
       regulation.

   The Compliance Review Program ensures that institutions comply with
   their policy and the PHS regulation in responding to allegations of
   research misconduct. In addition, the Compliance Review Program
   responds to retaliation complaints from whistleblowers and monitors the
   implementation of PHS administrative actions by institutions and PHS
   agencies.
