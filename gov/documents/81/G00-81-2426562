                      About the U.S. Geological Survey

   As the nation's largest water, earth and biological science and
   civilian mapping agency, the USGS works in cooperation with more than
   2000 organizations across the country to provide reliable, impartial,
   scientific information to resource managers, planners, and other
   customers. This information is gathered in every state by USGS
   scientists to minimize the loss of life and property from natural
   disasters, to contribute to the conservation and the sound economic and
   physical development of the nation's natural resources, and to enhance
   the quality of life by monitoring water, biological, energy and mineral
   resources.
