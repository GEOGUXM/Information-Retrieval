                              PRIVACY STATEMENT

   A. This is a United States Government computer system, maintained
   pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1331 et al. All data on this system may be
   monitored by, recorded by, and disclosed to authorized personnel, in
   any manner. Use of this system by any user, authorized or unauthorized,
   constitutes consent to this monitoring, recording, and disclosure.
   Improper use may be punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1030 et al.

   B. We do not collect information identifying you as an individual
   unless you choose to provide such information. We learn certain
   information automatically from your visit to our websites:

     * The Internet Protocol address of your computer or firewall, and the
       name of the domain (e.g., your_company.com or aol.com) and server
       from which you access the Internet;
     * Your browser type, operating system, and HTTP request method;
     * The date and time you access our sites and how long your
       transaction lasted;
     * The pages and sizes of our sites you access;
     * The status of your request; and
     * The website from which you linked directly to our sites.

   If you visit certain pages of our sites, you will be asked to supply
   additional information such as your name, telephone number, and e-mail
   address, employer type, agency or firm name, address, and account
   number. Disclosure of such information is voluntary, but failure to
   provide the information may result in denial of access to certain
   pages.

   C. We primarily use the information to help you in obtaining the
   assistance you seek from our sites. We also use the information for
   statistical purposes, such as assessing numbers of visitors, system
   performance and cost, and identifying problem areas. Finally, we
   monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or
   change information, or otherwise cause damage, knowingly or
   inadvertently. Information may be shared with staff of our agency and
   contractors assisting our staff who have a need for the information.
   When required by law or in very unusual circumstances such as misuse of
   our system, we may share individual information with Congress, the
   public, union personnel, other agencies, or in litigation. We handle
   information in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Act of
   1974, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552a; in particular, we recognize the importance of
   safeguarding personal privacy, and do not normally publish information
   that identifies individuals except as required by law.

   D. Certain pages on our site use "session cookies." A session cookie is
   a small piece of information containing a random number and an
   expiration time that is placed on your computer when you access a page.
   Cookies help us support your shopping cart transactions. You are not
   obligated to accept cookies from us, but if you do not, some of the
   functions on our site may not be available to you. Once your
   transaction is completed, our cookie expires. Our cookies do not
   contain individually identifiable information, and we do not share
   cookie information outside the agency.
