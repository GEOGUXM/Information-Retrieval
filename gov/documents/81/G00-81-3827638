[why.gif] In traditional models of the atmosphere, the extent of the
          influence of the ocean on the atmosphere is limited to providing the
          bottom boundary condition in terms of SST. It has become increasingly
          clear that the finite heat capacity of the upper ocean and the
          dependence of air-sea momentum transfer on the sea state must be
          properly accounted for. In many cases, the two-way interaction between
          the ocean and the atmosphere is crucial to the evolution of meso-scale
          features in the atmosphere.

     For research on air-sea interactions and ocean-atmosphere coupling on
     sub-basin scales, the NOAA/ETL-CU Coupled Coastal Modeling System
     (CCMS) has been developed that couples the Penn State/NCAR mesoscale
     atmospheric model (MM5V2) to the University of Colorado version of the
     Princeton ocean model (CUPOM) through the WAMDI group wave model cycle
     4 (WAM). The entire development is lead by J.-W. Bao and J.M. Wilczak
     at NOAA/ETL in collaboration with L. Kantha and J.-K. Choi at
     University of Colorado. MM5V2 is a regional, finite-difference,
     nonhydrostatic, three-dimensional primitive equation-based numerical
     weather prediction model with movable nesting capability. CUPOM is a
     three-dimensional, hydrostatic, Boussinesq, sigma-coordinate model that
     is well-suited for application to marginal and coastal seas. WAM
     describes the evolution of the wave spectrum by solving the wave energy
     transfer equation with no constraints on the spectral shape. The three
     model components of CCMS are initialized separately at this moment.
     MM5V2 is initialized by performing a successive-scan Cressman objective
     analysis on conventional surface and rawinsonde observations, together
     with the first guess fields from the gridded global analyses of wind,
     temperature, geopotential, and relative humidity at the mandatory
     levels from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. CUPOM is
     initialized using results from an ocean nowcast model simulation forced
     by six-hourly wind stresses from the U.S. Navy FNMOC. In addition, the
     model assimilates TOPEX altimetric data and the SST is damped to weekly
     MCSSTs derived from NOAA AVHRR data to provide a realistic state of the
     ocean at the start of the coupled model forecast. WAM is used to
     properly partition the stress applied by the atmosphere to waves and
     ocean currents. CCMS has been applied to simulations of Hurricane Opal
     (1995) and Hurricane Danny (1997) in the Gulf Mexico.
