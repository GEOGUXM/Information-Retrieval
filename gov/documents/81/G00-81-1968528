   The U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century was initiated
   over two years ago out of a conviction that the entire range of U.S.
   national security policies and processes required examination in light
   of new circumstances that lie ahead.
   The Phase II Report devised a U.S. national security strategy to deal
   with the world in 2025. The purpose of the Phase II Report is to define
   an American strategy based on U.S. interests and key objectives. It
   develops a strategy for America to reap the benefits of a more
   integrated world to expand freedom, security, and prosperity and to
   dampen the forces of instability.
