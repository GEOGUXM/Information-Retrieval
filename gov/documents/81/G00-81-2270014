   Customer Survey

   Click here to read the letter from DWR's Deputy Director, Jonas Minton,
   inviting you to take the survey (.doc format).

   What is the purpose of the survey?

   The purpose is three-fold:
    1. Marketing - to increase awareness and acceptance (e.g., expanding
       our user base, increasing credibility through stakeholder buy-in)
    2. User Needs Assessment - to answer, "How can the Water Plan best
       assist existing and potential Water Plan users with their
       missions?"
    3. Evaluation â€“ to answer, "What can we do better and how?"

   What is the main question we are trying to answer?


    How can we make the Plan more widely read, understood and useful?

   Who is the target audience?

   The target audience is very diverse as we are trying to reach existing
   as well as potential new users.  This expands the audience of
   government, private and non-profit entities to include land use
   planners, natural resources planners, environmental and social advocacy
   groups, business sectors (e.g., agricultural, real estate, financing),
   professional associations, academic institutions, water planners,
   wholesalers and retailers, and similar individuals and groups.

   How will we use the information?

   Two key deliverables resulting from this survey will be: (1) a summary
   of user suggestions; and (2) correlations intended to tell us
   which elements of the plan are most and least used/useful and to whom.
   We will capture all of these suggestions and correlations and share
   them with the public Advisory Committee for Update 2003. Based on their
   input and DWR resources, suggestions and insights will either be
   incorporated into Update 2003 or will be available for use by the
   Update 2008 team.
