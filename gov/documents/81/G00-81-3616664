                            NASA Energy Mission:
   "Improving energy efficiency to save taxpayer dollars, reduce emissions
    contributing to air pollution and global climate change, and conserve
             precious natural resources for future generations."

        KSC Energy Program ensures we make continual progress towards
   compliance with Federal energy efficiency mandates and reducing energy
                                   costs.
