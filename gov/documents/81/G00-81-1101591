                                 Space Wear

   Astronauts wear various types of clothing for all aspects of a mission
   to space. Whether it is preparing for launch, working inside the space
   shuttle, working inside the space station, working outside in space or
     landing back on Earth, astronauts wear the proper garments for both
                           comfort and protection.

   Before a shuttle launch, the astronauts are dressed in orange pressure
    suits. In the event of a pressure leak in the space shuttle's flight
     cabin, the suits would maintain a positive air pressure around the
      astronaut. This provides enough air pressure for the astronaut to
     survive the return to Earth during an emergency landing. Should an
    astronaut be forced to bail out over cold water, the pressurized suit
                   would also provide thermal protection.

       Just before entering the space shuttle and after they have been
       outfitted in their pressure suits, the astronauts are helped by
    technicians into a parachute harness and a back support pad. The back
   support pad, or lumbar pad, is inflatable and helps provide comfort as
     astronauts wait for launch inside the shuttle. After crawling into
   their seats, the helmet is installed on the suit and the astronauts are
    attached to parachutes. The parachutes, along with survival equipment
   stored in the suit, would be used in the event of a bailout emergency.
   These same suits are also worn during re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.

   Once in space, the astronauts don more comfortable gear. The shuttle's
     crew cabin is essentially a shirt-sleeve environment from which to
        perform experiments or space-related work. Shirts are casual
    long-sleeve or short-sleeve golf-type shirts. The trousers come with
      velcro strips to which pockets or food trays can be attached. The
         astronauts can also wear shorts if they choose. Aboard the
    International Space Station, the astronauts wear essentially the same
     thing. However, the astronauts occasionally wear their nicer flight
     suits for events such as interviews with reporters on Earth. Since
    shoes aren't necessary when floating in space the shuttle and station
                          crews wear slipper-socks.

     Working outside in the vacuum of space requires special suits that
   provide an environment necessary for the survival, mobility and comfort
   of a space walker. Built with up to nine protective layers, these suits
    supply oxygen and shield astronauts from temperature extremes, debris
     and meteoroids, and other hazards of space. Water-cooling tubes run
    through the astronauts long underwear to provide comfort and prevent
   overheating during active work periods. The helmet visors also protect
              against solar ultraviolet and infrared radiation.

    Space suits contain enough oxygen, power and other consumables to let
   the astronaut walk in space for up to about eight hours (although space
     walks are usually planned for less). They can be recharged and used
    again for 24 more space walks before they need to be returned to the
    ground for a tune up. The different parts of the space suits, such as
   the arms, elbows, knees and legs come in various sizes and are attached
   to make one complete space suit that fits the space walker. This can be
   done prior to launch, or in space as long as the correct parts for any
                       given astronaut are available.

   How many changes of clothes does an astronaut bring in space?

   *
     Two (2): A casual work outfit during the day and a suit for formal
     events at night.
   *
     Three (3): a launch suit, a work outfit and space suit.
   *
     Four (4): a spring ensemble, a summer swimsuit, a fall work uniform and
     a winter coat.
   *
     Depends on the length of the mission.
