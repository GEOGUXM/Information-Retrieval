      EXIST is being studied as a Free Flyer mission. Following is the
    Presentation to SEUS/Roadmap Committees by Josh Grindlay (December 3,
                   2001) and associated movie (.mpg) file:

   EXIST was recommended as a high priority mission for the coming decade
   by the NASA Gamma Ray Program Working Group (GRAPWG), as summarized in
   the 1999 GRAPWG Report. The Decadal Survey Report recommended EXIST as
    a mission for this decade. EXIST was included in the most recent NASA
   Strategic Plan as a Mid-Term mission; it is now being considered by the
     Structure and Evolution of the Universe Science (SEUS) and Roadmap
                   committees for the next Strategic Plan.
   Accordingly, an EXIST Science Working Group (EXSWG) has been formed to
    further define the science and mission needs for EXIST. The EXSWG is
    likely to expand  beyond the present initial group as the mission is
           further defined and considered in the planning process.
     EXIST would make use of large area arrays of Cd-Zn-Te (CZT) imaging
     hard x-ray detectors. Technology development for CZT is progressing
        rapidly, with major interest for medical x-ray imaging. EXIST
   Technology development  will also include accomodation of the telescope
   modules and both hardware and software for real-time "back projection"
           imaging of each photon at the full data rates expected.
