   Since 1996, under the auspices of The Pew Charitable Trusts, the
   Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs of Syracuse University
   has rated the management capacity of local and state governments and
   selected federal agencies in the United States. The project, called the
   Government Performance Project (GPP), is administered by The Maxwell
   Schools Alan K. Campbell Public Affairs Institute. The GPP is a
   comprehensive survey of the effectiveness of core government management
   activities. It is the most in-depth survey ever completed. For the 2002
   survey, Maricopa County was selected to be reviewed and graded. The
   survey was divided into six categories. To view our responses returned
   in the survey, click a category of interest.
