   relevance of each element of the D3D The D3D software, as delivered by
   FSL, was configured to software, and how it could be used if included
   in future display case study data. A case study was included in the
   AWIPS builds. In addition, due to the beta status of the original
   software package distribution. Since the test was software, questions
   concerning software performance intended to gauge the utility of the
   D3D workstation in an were included. The results of the questionnaires
   can then be used as input to the D3D developers at FSL. 4.2 Using

   utility of D3D is The third dimension was simulated by changing the
   values to present two examples where the capability of D3D, as of

   on a surface, such as vorticity on the 500-mb surface, one would have
   trouble reconciling which of the vorticity maximums will likely have
   the most effect on the sensible weather at the surface. As documented
   in this case, the vorticity advection, coupled with the temperature
   advection, produced numerous areas of upward vertical velocity. The
   three-dimensional area with the largest atmospheric depth had the most
   effect on the sensible weather at the surface.
