   Candidates and Committees
   "Receipts and expenditures in election campaigns should be fully and
   truthfully disclosed in order that the voters may be fully informed and
   improper practices may be inhibited."
   California Gov. Code Section 81002(a)
   California's Political Reform Act requires disclosure of campaign
   contributions and expenditures in connection with state and local
   elections, including ballot measure elections. Disclosure is required
   by:
     * Candidates for state and local offices
     * State and local elected officeholders
     * Campaign committees, including:
       1. Candidate controlled committees: State and local candidates and
       officeholders who receive contributions totaling $1,000 or more in
       a calendar year;
       2. Recipient committees: Individuals and organizations that receive
       contributions--$1,000 or more in a calendar year--to support or
       oppose state or local candidates, or to qualify, support or oppose
       state or local ballot measures, including initiative, referendum
       and recall measures (either primarily formed to support or oppose a
       single candidate or ballot measure, or more than one candidate or
       measure being voted on in a single election, or general purpose to
       support or oppose a variety of candidates and/or measures);
       3. Major donor committees: Individuals or entities that use their
       own money (i.e., personal funds, corporate or business funds) to
       make contributions totaling $10,000 or more in a calendar year to
       candidates or to committees supporting or opposing candidates or
       ballot measures;
       4. Independent expenditure committees: Individuals or entities that
       use their own money to make "independent expenditures" totaling
       $1,000 or more in a calendar year to support or oppose candidates
       or measures (e.g., Jane Brown uses personal funds to send a mailing
       to voters or to purchase an advertisement supporting a candidate,
       but she does so independently--not in coordination with the
       candidate or his or her campaign committee).

   There are also restrictions on how campaign funds are used. In general,
   expenditures from a candidate or recipient committee's campaign funds
   must be reasonably related to a political, legislative, or governmental
   purpose. Any expenditure that confers a substantial personal benefit on
   an individual must be directly related to a political, legislative, or
   governmental purpose.
   For detailed information, see the Forms and Manuals section.
   For federal elections (Presidential, U.S. Senate, House of
   Representatives), consult the Federal Election Commission at
   1-800-424-9530 or on the web at www.fec.gov.
