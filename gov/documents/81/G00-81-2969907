   Information Agency Provides to CSEAT



     Welcome to CSRC
     Feedback

     NIST CSEAT Team has just finished their review of our Information
     Security program and given us the draft report. They have done a great
     job for us. The report is a first-rate product and gives us a very
     practical guide on how best to apply our limited resources to fix our
     shortfalls.

     Of all the reviews and audits we have done on us or against us, this is
     the most useful.

     From communication between agency CIO and OMB

     Each review will produce high-level findings, a sanity check of how
     well personnel understand policies, and report with prioritized
     recommendations.

     "Gordon Fullerton, engineering division director in FEMAs IT Services
     Directorate, called the 95-page report probably one of the best Ive
     ever seen."

     "CSEAT team members studied all the agencys computer and communications
     systems and IT-related personnel practices. The team then recommended a
     list of actions that would give FEMA the most security for its money,
     Fullerton said. Fullertons staff will use the report, once complete, to
     brief upper-level managers and implement new security practices."
