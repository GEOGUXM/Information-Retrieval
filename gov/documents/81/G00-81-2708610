   Terra Mission Status

   New! Weekly Mission Status Updates

   April 19, 2000
          Terra, NASA's premier Earth Observing System satellite, is
          officially "open for business." First glimpse images of North
          America, the Indian subcontinent, and "spring greening" were
          among the observations from Terra's scientific instruments
          presented today at a NASA press briefing. (Terra Mission First
          Images Release)

   March 10, 2000
          After eleven weeks of on-orbit checkout and verification and a
          series of orbital ascent maneuvers, the Terra Spacecraft reached
          its final orbit on February 23. Terra's spacecraft subsystems
          continue to perform flawlessly, with almost all systems now in
          their operational science mode. (Terra Mission Status Report #8)

   February 1, 2000
          Terra is continuing with instrument activation. The MODIS
          instrument opened its space view door as well as performed its
          first recorder dump of data. Terra has also continued its orbit
          ascent maneuvers. (Terra Mission Status Report #7)

   January 20, 2000
          Terra continues to perform extremely well. On-board instruments
          are continuing their outgassing, the high gain antenna is being
          used for both S- and Ku-band transmissions, and maneuvers to
          move Terra up to its final orbit have begun. (Terra Mission
          Status Report #6)

   January 10, 2000
          Activation of the Terra spacecraft is continuing at a brisk
          pace. At weeks beginning, the spacecraft was placed back in the
          normal control mode (had been in earth sensor based acquisition
          mode during Y2K rollover), with communications via the high gain
          antenna. MOPITT and MODIS were powered-on, joining CERES and
          MISR which were powered-on before the New Year. (Terra Mission
          Status Report #5)

   December 29, 1999
          "Spacecraft operations under the control of the Spacecraft
          Controls Computer (SCC1) resumed yesterday. All subsystems
          on-board the spacecraft continue to operate extremely well and
          as expected. Flight software engineers were successful in
          recreating the scenario that resulted in the entrance into
          "safe-hold" on the fourth day of the mission. The spacecraft
          simulator (SSIM) was loaded with the identical conditions that
          were present on-orbit when the spacecraft controls computer
          initialized and handed control over to the safe-hold processor.
          The simulator duplicated the safe-hold entrance at the exact
          second in which it occurred on-orbit." (Terra Mission Status
          Report #4)

   December 23, 1999
          "Overall the mission is going extremely well, with the
          performance of both the team and the spacecraft superb," said
          Kevin Grady, Terra project manager at NASA's Goddard Space
          Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. "All of the activities planned to
          be completed by mission day 5 have now been accomplished, with
          the exception of the turn-on of one of the instrument outgas
          heaters. A number of spacecraft components have been powered-on
          over the past three days, and the performance of these has been
          excellent." (Terra Mission Status Report #3)

   December 22, 1999
          Activation of the Terra spacecraft is continuing, with the
          mission going extremely well. A number of spacecraft components
          have been powered-on over the past two days, and the performance
          has been nominal. (Terra Mission Status Report #2)

   December 18, 1999 -- Success!
          Terra lifted off today at 1:57 p.m. EST from Vandenberg Air
          Force Base. The liftoff took place at the very end of the 25
          minute launch window. View images from the launch (Terra Mission
          Status Report #1)

   December 17, 1999
          NASA Launch Managers postponed today's launch of the Terra
          spacecraft today from VAFB, CA, due to launch ground system
          problems. The launch has tentatively been rescheduled for no
          earlier than Saturday, December 18, 1999, at 1:33PM EST (10:33AM
          PST) with a launch window of 25 minutes.

   December 16, 1999
          Terra's scheduled December 16 launch attempt was scrubbed. The
          next attempt is scheduled tentatively for December 17, 1999 at
          1:30PM EST (10:30AM PST).
