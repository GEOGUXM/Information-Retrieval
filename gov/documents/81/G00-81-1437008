   For Immediate Release
   DODD, CORZINE ANNOUNCE INITIATIVE TO PROTECT INVESTING PUBLIC
   Legislation would take steps to improve auditor independence standards

   January 23, 2002

   Washington, D.C. Â— Senator Chris Dodd, D-Conn., Chairman of the
   Securities and Investment Subcommittee, and Senator Jon Corzine,
   D-N.J., former Co-Chairman of Goldman Sachs and a member of the
   Securities and Investment Subcommittee, announced their intent today to
   introduce legislation that would address longstanding problems in the
   accounting industry, including some that may have contributed to the
   collapse of Enron.

   "Our markets work when they're predicated on information that is
   truthful and accurate. That's why just as you wouldn't want the builder
   of your house to also be the building inspector we need to build a
   better financial firewall' to protect investors from conflicts of
   interest," said Dodd. "This proposal will help prevent future financial
   failures, like the one caused by Enron, and ensure renewed investor
   confidence and stability in the markets."

   "The public's trust in the independence of auditors is central to the
   integrity of our financial markets. That confidence has now been
   undermined. Investors must be sure that the sole purpose of an audit is
   full, truthful disclosure not some other end for the auditing firm, or
   its client. This proposal builds on the vision of former SEC Chairman
   Arthur Levitt, and goes further. The time is now to protect investors
   and restore the public trust," said Corzine.

   The proposed Investor Confidence Protection Act would: restrict
   independent auditors from providing non-audit services to audit
   clients; double the size of the SEC audit staff to enable them to
   improve oversight of public accounting; ban any accounting firm from
   providing a public audit for a company whose controller or chief
   financial officer had worked for such accounting firm in the previous
   two years; and strengthen the independence of the Financial Accounting
   Standards Board (FASB) by securing a steady funding source and
   demanding timeliness of action.
