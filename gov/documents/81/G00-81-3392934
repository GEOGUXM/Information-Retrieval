  Mineral Resources Program - Program Information

                    Technology and Information Dissemination

   USGS minerals research results are available to users in easily
   accessible, accurate, and timely products. Information is disseminated
   through traditional paper products, in digital form, over the Internet
   (http://minerals.usgs.gov/), by FAXBACK (703-648-4999), through
   interagency collaborations, and in technical and non-technical public
   presentations.

   In the last three years, the program has focused on electronically
   disseminating national and regional databases of geochemistry,
   geophysics, mineral and mine localities, and lithology, as well as the
   extensive science applications developed using the data. The USGS is
   actively working with partners to develop an interactive geospatial
   decision support system that can be served on the World Wide Web, and
   will assist land managers and policymakers with analysis of natural
   resources and the potential environmental effects of resource
   utilization.

   Included in this section is electronic dissemination of national and
   regional databases of geochemistry, geophysics, mineral and mine
   localities, and lithology
