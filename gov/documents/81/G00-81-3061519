   National Register of Historic Places/ Washington Heritage Register

   The Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP) administers
   two registers that provide formal recognition for the stateâ€™s diverse
   historic and cultural resources: The Washington Heritage Register and
   the National Register of Historic Places. Eligible properties include
   historic buildings, structures, historic and archeological sites,
   cultural landscapes, and traditional cultural properties.

   State and National Register properties are assets that help sustain the
   social, cultural, and economic well-being of communities. Listing
   properties in either register raises awareness about the values of
   historic and cultural resources and encourages their preservation. In
   certain jurisdictions, a state tax provision, known as the "special
   valuation," enables owners of state or National Register-listed
   properties to reduce property taxes.

   Owners of properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places
   may be eligible to take advantage of preservation easements, or federal
   tax incentives for the proper rehabilitation of income-producing
   properties.

   Many of these incentives may be combined to make attractive economic
   investments.

   More than 150 Heritage Register and National Register properties have
   been successfully rehabilitated, creating construction-related jobs,
   increased property values, and local tax revenues that have helped to
   revitalize local economies. A growing interest in heritage tourism has
   linked historic properties, archaeological sites, and cultural
   landscapes with economic development and tourist promotions. The
   educational potential of designated historic and cultural resources is
   unlimited.
