   1. Project Summary

          The main objectives of the Spatial Data Delivery Project (SDDP)
          are to: 1) coordinate the generation of complete, seamless,
          digital databases of geologic, lithologic, geochemical,
          geophysical, and mineral deposit information in consistent,
          standard formats; 2) develop methods and tools for serving this
          data to all customers, both internal and external, over the
          Internet; 3) develop Internet-based methods and tools for
          analytical processing of Mineral Resource Program (MRP) data;
          and 4) maintain communications with the rest of the Division and
          the Bureau on activities which are related to the electronic
          delivery of spatial data.

   2. Project Objectives

          The primary objective of this project is to develop hardware and
          software methods and tools for serving MRP spatial information
          over the Internet and to investigate the possibility of
          developing on-line data analysis tools. The national databases
          of the MRP, geochemistry, geophysics, mineral deposits, and
          lithology, require continual maintenance to fill in holes in the
          existing data, update information that is time dependent, and to
          continue to acquire new information. This project also serves as
          a vechicle for coordinating the development of standard data
          models and formats to build consistent, seamless, complete
          spatial data sets that are a required for serving MRP
          information on the Internet.

   3.Project Personnel

          The SDDP has put together a work group consisting of a project
          chief, five Surveys and Analysis project chiefs, five Regional
          GIS project chiefs, four National Database project chiefs, one
          representative of all MIT databases, and technical staff. This
          group coordinates all major spatial data activities within the
          MRP including, the collection of new data for the national
          databases, the transfer of national databases to the Oracle
          database manager and, where needed, the development of standard
          data models and formats for the national databases. The group
          has developed an Internet-based user interface to integrate
          access to all MRP national databases and investigating the
          possibility of developing Internet-based, on-line data analysis
          capability. The coordination activities of the project occur
          through periodic meetings of the entire project team as well as
          through smaller, topic-specific meetings.

   4.Technology Used

          The technology chosen to serve MRP spatial data over the
          Internet is ESRI's ArcView Internet Map Server (IMS). ArcView
          IMS allows users the ability to readily and easily display,
          analyze, and interpret MRP spatial data from their desktop using
          a Web browser connected to the Internet. The ArcView IMS client
          used by MRP (MapClient) has been extensively modified by the
          USGS for use with MRP data. The IMS application is currently
          being served from a Compaq 6000 Server with dual 450 MHZ Pentium
          II Xeon processors with 1024 MB RAM and 20 Gb of disk space.

          This site uses Unisys Patent No. 4,558,302 and/or foreign
          counterparts and is provided by Unisys as a public service.

   5. Future Enhancements

          The development and enhancement of the SDDP IMS application is
          active and ongoing. Currently, the IMS application and the
          MapClient Java applet are undergoing additional customization to
          provide added functionality. In the future additional spatial
          data sets will be made available.
