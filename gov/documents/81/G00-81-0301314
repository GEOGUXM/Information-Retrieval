                                   Mission

   The mission of the Scientific Visualization Studio is to facilitate
   scientific inquiry and outreach within NASA programs through
   visualization. To that end, the SVS works closely with scientists in
   the creation of visualization products, systems, and processes in order
   to promote a greater understanding of Earth and Space Science research
   activities at Goddard Space Flight Center and within the NASA research
   community.

   The work of the SVS is organized into several large projects supporting
   particular NASA programs and missions. We are always interested in
   consulting with anyone who might need our expertise, products, or
   facilities in order to further their mission.

     See our Projects page for a description of our current activities.


                                  Personnel

   The Scientific Visualization Studio is composed of visualizers from
   both the physical and computer sciences. This creative team includes
   people interested in creating animations and imagery from data, people
   interested in assembling end-to-end visualization systems, and people
   interested in visualization tools supporting scientific inquiry. The
   strength of the SVS comes from the synergy of having personnel involved
   in such a diversity of projects who can technically contribute to the
   solution of problems as they arise.

   See our Staff Directory page for a listing of our current personnel,
   their backgrounds, and contact information.


                                 Facilities

   The Scientific Visualization Studio is in the Earth and Space Data and
   Computing Division, part of the Earth Sciences Directorate at the NASA
   Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD. The SVS is co-located
   with the NASA Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS), from which it
   gets facility and system administration support.

   The work of the SVS is primarily performed on a tightly coupled group
   of SGI workstations of various sizes, augmented by a group of Apple
   Macintosh systems for image and video editing. Video creation and
   digitization is performed on a dedicated video distribution
   infrastructure comprised of various tape, encoder, and display systems.

   See our Facilities page for more information on the tools and systems
   available in the SVS.
