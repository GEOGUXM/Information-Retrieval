  [world.gif] Global tropospheric ozone production

   [bluebar.gif]

   Most of us have heard about ozone in the context of the stratosphere's
   ozone layer (the "good" ozone, 10-15 miles above our heads, that
   shields us from harmful ultraviolet radiation). Most of us have also
   heard about ozone in the context of pollution problems in smoggy cities
   and even in some rural areas (the "bad" ozone at the Earth's surface
   that harms crops, forests, and human health). This is the story of yet
   another of ozone's roles in our atmosphere, one that you might not be
   as familiar with. Here we will consider the bulk of ozone that exists
   in the entire lower atmosphere ("troposphere"), not just the "smog"
   ozone at surface locations.

   The Earth's atmosphere is a reactive chemical system. Ozone, as one of
   the most reactive gases in the atmosphere, is one of the key players in
   chemical processes that "cleanse" it of various substances. For
   example, ozone either directly or indirectly contributes to the
   breakdown of a wide range of substances containing carbon and hydrogen,
   such as methane (CH[4]) and the hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) that
   are being used as substitutes for ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons
   (CFCs). The cleansing action causes these and other gases to be removed
   from the lower atmosphere, or troposphere, and limits (or, in some
   cases, eliminates) their ability to reach the stratosphere.

   Many of these gases are infrared-active-- "greenhouse gases." They
   absorb infrared (heat) radiation that would otherwise escape to space,
   lending a warming term to the heat budget of our planet. And ozone
   itself is a major greenhouse gas.

   Changes in tropospheric ozone and its chemical precursors are thus
   coupled to the Earth's climate system, both directly (because ozone
   itself absorbs infrared radiation) and indirectly (because ozone, its
   precursors, and its close relatives influence the amount of other
   greenhouse gases in the atmosphere).

   What processes govern the amount of ozone in the global troposphere?
   How are the activities of humans affecting that ozone and, more
   generally, the oxidizing capabilities of the lower atmosphere? What are
   the implications of changes in global tropospheric ozone for climate?
   At the Aeronomy Laboratory, scientists are engaged in field,
   theoretical, and laboratory studies that address these questions (see
   below).
