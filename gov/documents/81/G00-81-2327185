   The U.S. Commerce Departments Trade Compliance Center (TCC) now offers
   American companies new and simpler exporting tools through its
   redesigned website at www.export.gov/tcc.

   Our top priority is to ensure that U.S. firms and workers receive the
   full benefits negotiated in our trade agreements and that foreign
   governments comply with their trade obligations to the United States,
   said William H. Lash, III, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Market
   Access and Compliance.

   The newly refurbished TCC On-Line web site delivers to the business
   community proven tools to maximize export opportunities:

     * One touch access to the Trade and Related Agreements database with
       nearly 300 agreements with links to Exporter's Guides 
       plain-language executive summaries
     * Improved search and index functions put the most relevant
       information at visitors fingertips; search by content areas,
       including Agreements, Exporter's Guides, Market Access News and
       Country Market Reports
     * Links to all of the Commerce Department export resources via
       Export.gov and to Export Alert! for notifications of proposed
       technical regulations in global markets.

   With this latest upgrade of the TCC On-Line, the Commerce Department
