   Many U.S. Passenger Cars
   Are Driven on "Bald" Tires,
   NHTSA Research Shows

   U.S. Transportation Secretary Mineta Announces Launch
   Of Major Nationwide Campaign to Promote Tire Safety

   Responding to new studies showing that a significant number of American
   motorists are driving on bald tires and that many gas stations that
   provide air pumps fail to provide accurate tire pressure gauges, U.S.
   Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta today urged motorists to
   closely monitor their tires.

   "It is extremely important to motorists' safety that they ensure their
   tires have ample tread and are properly inflated," Secretary Mineta
   said. "Motorists who drive on tires that are bald or substantially
   under-inflated risk injuries or fatalities."

   To better protect motorists, the U.S. Department of Transportation's
   National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is launching a
   new tire safety campaign based on the theme: "Tire Safety: Everything
   Rides on It." The purpose of the campaign, to involve radio public
   service announcements, print ads and brochures, is to stress the
   importance of proper tire inflation and vehicle load limits. The
   campaign is also designed to encourage motorists to check their tires
   monthly, as well as prior to a long trip, to be sure they have adequate
   tread.

   "It is vitally important that motorists monitor tread depth to guard
   against tire failure and replace unsafe tires. Checking tires is a
   crucial element in regular vehicle maintenance," said Dr. Jeffrey W.
   Runge, NHTSA's Administrator.

   According to a major survey conducted by NHTSA, fully 9 percent of
   passenger cars on U.S. roadways are driven with at least one bald tire.

   Moreover, another major NHTSA study found that 14 percent of gas
   stations are either not equipped with air pumps or have malfunctioning
   pumps. Also, only 49 percent of gas stations that are equipped with air
   pumps provide tire pressure gauges, which are critical to determining
   if the correct amount of air has been delivered to tires. However, for
   a nominal price, motorists can purchase a tire pressure gauge.

   To help vehicle owners better monitor the air pressure in their tires,
   NHTSA in July proposed a new federal motor vehicle safety standard that
   would require the installation of tire pressure monitoring systems in
   new passenger cars and light trucks. The new system would warn the
   driver when a vehicle has a significantly under-inflated tire.

   One alternative would require that the driver be warned when the
   pressure in one or more tires, up to a total of four tires, has fallen
   to 20 percent or more below the vehicle manufacturer's recommended cold
   inflation pressure for the vehicle's tires, or a minimum level of
   pressure to be specified in the new standard, whichever is higher.

   The other alternative would require that the driver be warned when tire
   pressure in one or more tires, up to a total of three tires, has fallen
   to 25 percent or more below the vehicle manufacturer's recommended cold
   inflation pressure for the vehicle's tires, or a minimum level of
   pressure to be specified in the new standard, whichever is higher. Only
   one version will be in the final rule.

   Tire tread provides the gripping action and traction that prevent a
   vehicle from slipping and sliding, especially when the road is wet or
   icy. In general, tires are not safe and should be replaced when the
   tread is worn down to 1/16th of an inch. Tires have built-in treadwear
   indicators that let a motorist know when they should be replaced. These
   indicators are raised sections spaced intermittently in the bottom of
   the tread grooves. When they appear "even" with the outside of the
   tread, it's time for tire replacement.

   Another method of checking tire tread involves use of a Lincoln penny.
   The motorist should place the penny upside down within the tread. If
   the top of Lincoln's head is visible, the tire needs to be replaced.

   NHTSA's new tire safety campaign will involve three new public service
   announcements to run on 2,000 radio stations throughout the country;
   print ads in newspapers and magazines; and more than 500,000 flyers to
   be given free-of-charge to consumers through tire retail outlets and
   other channels. Some of the materials will be in Spanish as well as
   English. Consumers can obtain tire safety information from NHTSA by
   calling the agency's Hotline: 888-327-4236. NHTSA's new flyer and
   brochure, both titled "Tire Safety: Everything Rides on It," can be
   viewed on the agency's web site, www.nhtsa.dot.gov.

   Printed materials used as part of the campaign will be distributed by
   NHTSA as well as Championship Auto Racing Teams, Inc. (CART), the
   Rubber Manufacturers Association (RMA), and the Tire Association of
   North America (TANA).

   NHTSA's analysis of tire wear was based on information gathered on
   6,240 passenger cars during a 14-day period earlier this year.
   Information for the survey was collected with the cooperation of
   motorists who visited gas stations for refueling at 300 sites in urban,
   suburban and rural settings located throughout the country.

   To conduct its survey on air pumps at gas stations, NHTSA collected
   information at the same 300 stations where data were gathered on tire
   wear. Just 139 of those 300 stations were found to have working air
   pumps, along with tire pressure gauges. These stations were later
   revisited to evaluate the accuracy of their gauges.

   Key findings of the NHTSA study on tire tread include these estimates:
     * Nine percent of passenger cars are being driven on at least one
       "bald" tire. (For purposes of this survey, a tire was considered
       bald if it had 1/16th of an inch or less of tread depth.)
     * Bald tires are between 1.5 and 1.8 times more likely to be
       underinflated than are tires with deeper tread, depending on tire
       location. Key findings of the NHTSA study on gas station air pumps
       include these estimates:
     * Well over 90 percent of U.S. gas stations are equipped with air
       pumps. However, nearly 10 percent of these pumps are out-of-order.
     * Fewer than half of the pump-equipped gas stations also provide a
       tire pressure gauge for customer use.
     * Nearly 20 percent of the stations providing customers with tire
       pressure gauges on their air pumps use gauges that over-report the
       pressure present in a tire by at least 4 psi (pounds per square
       inch) or more. (This means that motorists who use such gauges in
       the belief that they are inflating their tires to the recommended
       pressure would, in fact, be under-inflating them by 4 psi or more.)
     * At the pressure levels that are typical for most passenger cars or
       SUVs, nearly 10 percent of gas station air pump gauges over-report
       by 6 psi or more.

   A NHTSA research survey of U.S. passenger vehicles that was released in
   August found that 27 percent of passenger cars on U.S. roadways are
   driven with one or more substantially under-inflated tires. In
   addition, the survey found that 33 percent of light trucks (including
   sport utility vehicles, vans and pickup trucks) are driven with one or
   more substantially under-inflated tires.

   A radial tire can lose much of its air pressure and still appear to be
   fully inflated. Operating a vehicle with substantially under-inflated
   tires can result in a tire failure, such as instances of tire
   separation and blowouts, with the potential for a loss of control of
   the vehicle. Under-inflated tires also shorten tire life and increase
   fuel consumption.

   Tires should be inflated in accord with the vehicle manufacturer's
   recommendations. These can be found in the owner's manual or on a
   placard, which is often located in the glove compartment or on the
   driver's doorjamb. Motorists should not rely on visual tire inspections
   to determine whether a tire is properly inflated but should use a tire
   pressure gauge to do so.

   Like tires that are under-inflated, bald tires also pose risks to
   motorists. A tire with insufficient tread can cause a driver to lose
   traction, especially under wet conditions. In addition, bald tires are
   more prone to damage caused by road debris.

   NHTSA's National Center for Statistics and Analysis conducted the two
   new studies. Statistics from the studies are contained in research
   notes on the agency's Website at: www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/ncsa.
