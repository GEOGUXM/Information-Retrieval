Impacts of Volcanic Gases on Climate, the Environment, and People

  U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 97-262
  Version 1.0

   By Kenneth A. McGee, Michael P. Doukas, Richard Kessler, and Terrence
   M. Gerlach

   1997

   Gases from volcanoes give rise to numerous impacts on climate, the
   environment, and people. U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists are
   inventorying gas emissions at many of the almost 70 active volcanoes in
   the United States. This effort helps build a better understanding of
   the dynamic processes at work on the Earth's surface and is
   contributing important new information on how volcanic emissions affect
   global change.
