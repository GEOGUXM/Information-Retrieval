   Environmental Measurements

      The Toxics Program develops methods for field and laboratory
      measurements of a wide range of environmental properties. The
      effectiveness of simulation models and qualitative judgements is
      limited by our ability to make efficient and accurate measurements of
      properties as fundamental as streamflow, and as complex as the
      concentrations of a trace contaminant in different media (water,
      sediment and tissue).Techniques include:
        * Aquifer and tracer tests to determine flow and transport properties
          in unconsolidated and fractured-rock aquifers,
        * Stream tracers to determine contaminant sources and dispersal,
          surface and borehole geophysics that indicate subsurface
          properties,
        * Measurement of chemical tracers, such as CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons)
          or caffeine, or isotopes that indicate relative age and source,
        * Measurement of the concentration of pesticides and their
          environmental degradates, and
        * Laboratory experiments that estimate rates of biodegradation.
