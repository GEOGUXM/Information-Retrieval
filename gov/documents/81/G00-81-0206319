                Eruption Warning and Real-Time Notifications

   The best warning of a volcanic eruption is one that specifies when and
   where an eruption is most likely to occur and what type and size
   eruption should be expected. Such accurate predictions are sometimes
   possible but still rare in volcanology. The most accurate warnings are
   those in which scientists indicate an eruption is probably only hours
   to days away based on significant changes in a volcano's earthquake
   activity, ground deformation, and gas emissions. Experience from around
   the world has shown that most eruptions are preceded by such changes
   over a period of days to weeks.

   A volcano may begin to show signs of unrest several months to a few
   years before an eruption. In these cases, however, a warning that
   specifies when it might erupt months to years ahead of time are
   extremely rare.


             People need real-time warnings of volcanic activity

   Just as important as advance warning for saving lives and minimizing
   property damage is the real-time detection of a sudden eruption or
   lahar and immediate notification of the activity to the public and
   local, state, and federal emergency-management officials.

    Strategy of Volcano Warnings

   System of Alert Levels in use for various volcanic areas in the United
   States.

   The strategy that we use to provide volcano warnings in the United
   States involves a series of alert levels that correspond generally to
   increasing levels of volcanic activity. As a volcano becomes
   increasingly active or as our monitoring data suggest that a given
   level of unrest is likely to lead to a significant eruption, we declare
   a corresponding higher alert level. This alert level ranking thus
   offers the public and civil authorities a framework they can use to
   gauge and coordinate their response to a developing volcano emergency.

   We currently use different alert levels (also referred to as status
   levels, condition levels, or color code) for providing volcano warnings
   and emergency information regarding volcanic unrest and eruptions.
   These levels are different for Long Valley caldera in California and
   for volcanoes in Alaska, the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest,
   and Hawai`i for several reasons:
    1. Volcanoes exhibit different patterns of unrest in the weeks to
       hours before they erupt, which means that uniform and strict
       criteria cannot be applied to all episodes of unrest
    2. Communities, people, and economic activity are threatened by US
       volcanoes with different types of volcano hazards so that a warning
       scheme must address specific hazards from a volcano
    3. US volcanoes are not monitored with the same degree of intensity,
       depending on degree of historical unrest and eruptions and
       potential future risk
