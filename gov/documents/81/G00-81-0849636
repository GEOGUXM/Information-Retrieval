   [sv_image3.jpg] Welcome to my North East Ohio office, serving the
   counties of Ashland, Ashtabula, Carroll, Columbiana, Crawford,
   Harrison, Holmes, Huron, Jefferson, Mahoning, Medina, Portage,
   Richland, Stark, Summit, Trumbull, and Wayne.
   My job in the Senate begins and ends with Ohio. Everything I do is
   focused on service to the people of our state. I believe we all have
   been given missions in life and I believe mine is to work in public
   service to improve the lives of my fellow Ohioans and Americans.
   I am privileged to have the opportunity to be of immediate and direct
   assistance to the citizens of Ohio through my five regional offices,
   which are charged with providing local level responsiveness on issues
   before the federal government.
   My North East Ohio office plays a key role in gathering information
   about issues that are affecting the state. My District Staff
   communicate those issues to me on a regular basis so that I can do the
   best job I can of serving Ohio. The best way to let me know your
   thoughts on key issues is to call, write, or email me at any of my
   state or DC offices, or to visit the office nearest you between the
   hours of 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. Please call or email in advance to set up
   an appointment so my staff may prepare for your visit.
   Additionally, my District Staff regularly travel throughout the region
   to work with local community leaders to see how the federal government
   can help them implement local solutions to local problems. Ohioans meet
   personally with District Staff during office hours held in each of
   Ohio's 88 counties each year.
   What new challenges should I address? How can I assist you? I welcome
   your feedback to information on this website and answers to these
   questions. I am proud to serve Ohio and, with your help, together we
   will continue to make a positive difference for our great state and
   nation.
