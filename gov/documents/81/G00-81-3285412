   The Imaging Compton Telescope (COMPTEL) utilizes the Compton Effect and
   two layers of gamma-ray detectors to reconstruct an image of a
   gamma-ray source in the energy range 1 to 30 million electron volts
   (MeV). Gamma rays from active galaxies, radioactive supernova remnants,
   and diffuse gamma rays from giant molecular clouds can be studied with
   this instrument.
   COMPTEL's upper layer of detectors are filled with a liquid
   scintillator which scatters an incoming gamma-ray photon according to
   the Compton Effect. This photon is then absorbed by NaI crystals in the
   lower detectors. The instrument records the time, location, and energy
   of the events in each layer of detectors which makes it possible to
   determine the direction and energy of the original gamma-ray photon and
   reconstruct an image and energy spectrum of the source.
