       Heat and Energy Pathfinder


   Heat & Energy Some of the sun's rays reaching the Earth are reflected
   back up into space, and some are absorbed and stored as heat energy.
   Some of this stored heat is later emitted and radiated back into space,
   but some of the heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
   and re-radiated back to the surface. Is the Earth currently storing
   more radiant energy than it reflects and emits back to space? Or, is
   the "radiation budget" in balance?
