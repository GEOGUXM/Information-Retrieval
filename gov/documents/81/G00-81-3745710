   Employee Assistance
   FedSource offers Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) to help improve the
   productivity and well-being of your employees. These programs are
   designed to help employees and their family members identify and
   resolve problems that may interfere with job performance.


   How will my agency benefit from an EAP program?
   For every dollar they invest in an EAP, employers generally save
   anywhere from $5 to $16. The average annual cost for an EAP ranges from
   $12 to $20 per employee. --What Works: Workplaces Without Drugs - U.S.
   Department of Labor, 1990.

   Confidential Service
   All EAP services are treated with the strictest confidence. The
   personal information that you share with your EAP counselor is
   confidential, unless you sign a release of information, or if the law
   requires disclosure. Every EAP counselor knows that keeping your
   situation confidential is important. That goes for any help we provide
   you or anyone in your family. We want you to feel absolutely
   comfortable with us. That way we can make sure we are providing you
   with the best advice and care possible.

   Nationwide Practitioner Network
   The FedSource network includes thousands of licensed credentialed
   professionals who can help with almost any situation. EAP counselors
   are located throughout the country, including U.S. territories,
   ensuring that care is never far away.
