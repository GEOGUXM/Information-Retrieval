                                December 11, 2001

     As I started to put pen to paper to write this article on this 11th day
     of December, 2001, my thoughts turned to that fateful day three months
     ago. I remember it started like any typical Monday morning for me;
     phone message light flashing, email waiting to be read, mail waiting to
     be opened and my secretary scheduling the week's meetings. Suddenly, I
     hear someone yelling past my door that a plane had accidentally hit the
     World Trade Center. I quickly thought that cannot be some accident but
     someone who had intended to hit the building.

     I ran into the hallway and could hear the television on in the
     Immigration & Naturalization Senior Officer's office blaring out the
     ghastly details of the events unfolding in New York City. I entered the
     office where at least twenty people were crowded around and my eyes
     quickly glanced outside the window and I saw a large black cloud
     forming in the distance near the Washington Monument. The Pentagon was
     also hit! Cell phones and office phones were ringing, including mine.
     My daughter from New Hampshire was on the line screaming and crying for
     me to leave the building, to leave DC now! I tried to calm her fears,
     to give her comfort that I am all right and that I was in a safe place
     but all I could hear was her screaming and crying. She was not to be
     consoled. I explained to her that I had a job to do, that as an officer
     it was my duty to stay at my station until I received further orders.
     She screamed at me - "Who do I think I am? What could I possibly do as
     a PHS Officer?" Before I could respond, the call went dead. All cell
     phones became inoperable. My daughter's words stayed in my head all
     that day and for the next several weeks. What could I do as a PHS
     Officer? It has become my personal challenge to try to answer that
     question in everything that I do. I am committed to devoting my
     resources and energies to serve - to serve my family, my community, my
     profession, my fellow officers and my country.

     After this life changing event, I have felt a renewed energy and sense
     of commitment. Not long after September, I was given a great honor and
     privilege to serve, in an acting capacity, as your Chief Health
     Services Officer. I have channeled my energies and resources into this
     position to continue to move us forward, to make a contribution to the
     Corps and to meet the challenges of our mission. Through this position
     as Chief Health Services Officer, I hope to continue to answer the
     question of what we all can do as USPHS Officers in these changing
     times. I know we must grow in order to serve, we must recognize and
     respect the worth and value of our fellow officers and we must not be
     satisfied with the status quo. We must stimulate change through
     innovation and renewal and not be afraid of taking risks. Your HS-PAC
     has made significant efforts in the areas of recruitment and retention
     and formulated recommendations for improvement in the appointment and
     promotion processes.

     We must instill these values among our officers, especially in our
     junior officers, who continue to develop their leadership skills. We
     must support a strong and vigorous mentoring program, which will
     strengthen the Corps and our Category, which your HS-PAC is making
     available on line through the HS-PAC web site. We must be open to new
     opportunities, to stretch our minds. Such new opportunities are being
     vigorously explored with City of DC's Child and Family Protective
     Services Department and the Division of Commissioned Corps to enter
     into an agreement for social workers. Discussions and efforts are also
     continuing with the Veteran's Administration. In addition, the doors of
     opportunity are also opening in local, county and state health
     departments and the door is wide open with the Department of
     Agriculture.

     The marketing of our Category to agencies and organizations outside the
     Corps require the efforts and assistance from each of you. Such a large
     undertaking cannot be done by one person and needs the talent and
     dedication of all Health Service Officers. Each Chief Professional
     Officer was directed by the Surgeon General's Office to provide a work
     force projection report for their respective category. I have projected
     an increase in our Category, over the next five years, to 2755
     officers. The projected increase is based on expected growth in the
     areas of bioterrorism, microbiology, research, mental health,
     information technology, radiological sciences, social workers, health
     education, respiratory therapy, public health
     administration/management/planning, to mention a few, and supported
     with Bureau of Labor statistics. The feedback and contributions
     received from your Discipline Representatives, HS-PAC members and
     numerous other HSOs to complete this report were invaluable.

     Let each of us ask ourselves, as we enter in to this new year, "What
     can I do as a USPHS Officer?" and take up the banner of renewed energy,
     vision and vigor to meet any future challenge that may cross our path!
     I look forward to serving alongside each of you over the next few
     months.
