                           OPENING PLENARY SPEECH
                          RAIL~VOLUTION CONFERENCE
                              SAN FRANCISCO, CA
                              November 30, 2001

   Thank you, Bill [Millar], for that kind introduction. I consider it
   quite an honor to be introduced by Bill  whom I have come to know as a
   superb leader and committed advocate for public transportation. During
   his tenure as president of APTA, Bill has reached out to a broad range
   of coalitions like Rail~Volution. He has led innovative efforts to
   promote public transportation and improve business practices throughout
   the industry. And, from my perspective, he has also been so very
   generous with his time. Already, I have turned to him on many occasions
   for advice and counsel. Thank you, Bill, for all that you and APTA have
   done to help me as I have learned the ropes at FTA, as well as for all
   that you do to promote and support public transportation.

   I also want to thank and acknowledge Congressman Earl Blumenaur,
   someone whom I greatly admire and respect. A fellow Oregonian,
   Representative Blumenaur is one of the founders of Rail~Volution, as
   well as the Congressional Bike Caucus and the Task Force on Livable
   Communities. He has been called the "Johnny Appleseed" of livability,
   but he has done far more than plant. He has nurtured this vital concept
   and tended crops all over the country, ensuring that livability is a
   healthy and thriving part of so many communities. I am sorry to say
   that I will miss the big event tomorrow morning, when he and Wendell
   Cox go head-to-head. I certainly dont always agree with Wendell, but
   both men have fine intellects and believe strongly in public
   transportation. Im just not sure whether to liken this event to the
   Lincoln-Douglas Debates or the Foreman-Ali match. Whichever it most
   resembles, Im sure it will be both enlightening and entertaining.

   I really cant tell you how pleased I am to finally be here at
   Rail~Volution! As part of my original trip to this conference in
   September, I had traveled to Los Angeles on the 10^th  and spent the
   next week grounded, along with thousands of other travelers, 3,000
   miles away from my family and my office in Washington, DC. Im sure Im
   not the only one here who would have much preferred to have been
   "Rail~Volutionizing" that week, for it would have meant that the world
   had not changed as it did. Certainly, we are different people  both
   professionally and personally  than we would have been had the tragic
   events of September 11 not occurred. But our public transportation
   providers proved on that day  and in the weeks and months afterward 
   that they are ready and able to respond. Throughout the nation  but
   especially in the Washington and New York metropolitan areas  subways
   and trains were essential to the rapid, safe evacuation of thousands of
   people. And it is thanks to many of the people in this room that
   America has such a superb public transportation system, ensuring
   mobility even in times of disaster.
