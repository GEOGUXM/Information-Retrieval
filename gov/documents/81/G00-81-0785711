INTRODUCTION

   This handbook is designed to familiarize you with the information
   available from the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) and how to
   obtain that information, including the process for making a Freedom of
   Information Act (FOIA) request. The process is neither complicated nor
   time-consuming. Following these guidelines will make it more likely
   that you will receive the information you are seeking in the shortest
   amount of time. This guide also includes descriptions of the types of
   records maintained by different parts of the agency, some of which are
   available without making a FOIA request.

   The Freedom of Information Act, which can be found in Title 5 of the
   United States Code, section 552, was enacted in 1966 and provides that
   any person has the right to request access to federal agency records or
   information. All agencies of the United States government are required
   to disclose records upon receiving a written request for them, except
   for those records that are protected from disclosure by the nine
   exemptions and three exclusions of the FOIA. This right of access is
   enforceable in court. The federal FOIA does not, however, provide a
   right of access to records held by state or local government agencies,
   or by private businesses or individuals. All states have their own
   statutes governing public access to state and local records and state
   authorities should be consulted for further information about them.

   There is no central office in the government which processes FOIA
   requests for all federal agencies. Each agency responds to requests for
   its own records. Therefore, before sending a request to the FLRA, you
   should determine whether this agency is likely to have the records you
   are seeking. Every federal department or agency either already has or
   will soon issue its own information guide, so if the records you are
   interested in are kept by another agency, you may wish to request a
   copy of that agency's Guide from its FOIA office.

   The formal rules for making FOIA requests to the FLRA are set forth in
   Chapter XIV of Volume 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. This
   multiple-volume set is available in all law libraries and federal
   depository libraries. A copy of the portions of Chapter XIV pertaining
   to making FOIA requests may be obtained from the Office of the
   Solicitor, Federal Labor Relations Authority, 607 14^th Street, NW,
   Suite 330, Washington, DC. 20424.

   The following are some general sources of information about how to make
   a FOIA request:

     "Your Right to Federal Records," available for fifty cents per copy
     from the Consumer Information Center, P.O. Box 100, Pueblo, CO
     81002. This publication also can be accessed electronically on the
     Internet at: http://cpsr.org/cpsr/foia/

     "A Citizen's Guide on Using the Freedom of Information Act and the
     Privacy Act of 1974 to Request Government Records." This report is
     published by the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight of the
     House of Representatives. It is available for sale for $5.00 from
     the U.S. Government Printing Office, stock number 052-071-012-30-3.
     It also can be accessed on the Internet by going to
     http://www.house.gov, selecting the committee pages, then selecting
     the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, and accessing the
     topic entitled "Committee and Subcommittee Reports."

     "Consumer's Resource Handbook." This handbook describes the federal
     agencies that are responsible for specific consumer problems and
     where to write for assistance. Single copies of this publication may
     be obtained for free by writing to: Handbook, U.S. Office of
     Consumer Affairs, 750 17th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.
     20006-4607. This booklet also can be found on the Internet at:
     http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/1997res.htm.

   Access to Certain Records Without a FOIA Request

   Certain types of FLRA records are available without the need to make a
   FOIA request. They include: (1) final opinions and orders made in
   adjudicating cases; (2) final statements of policy and interpretations
   which have not been published in the Federal Register; (3)
   administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a
   member of the public; (4) copies of records that have been the subject
   of a FOIA request and that are of sufficient public interest or
   curiosity that the agency believes other persons are likely to request
   them; and (5) the agency's annual FOIA report to Congress--which
   includes such information as the number of requests received by the
   agency, the amount of time taken to process requests, the total amount
   of fees collected by the agency, information regarding the backlog of
   pending requests, and other information about the agency's handling of
   FOIA requests. These types of records may be inspected in the FLRA's
   reading room, which is located in the FLRA's Headquarters Library at
   607 14^th Street, NW, Suite 404, Washington, DC. 20424.

   You may also access certain FLRA records online. The FLRA has a site on
   the World Wide Web which can be accessed at http://www.flra.gov/. This
   site includes links to the FLRA's Government Information Locator
   Service (GILS) site. In accordance with Office of Management and Budget
   guidance, agencies' descriptions of their major information systems and
   record locator systems are found through their GILS sites. The text of
   the FLRA's GILS site is attached to this guide as Attachment A. In
   addition, the records referred to as items 1 through 4 in the preceding
   paragraph are also available by accessing the FLRA's web site.

   determinations of representation petitions. Consistent with its
   statutory charge to provide leadership in establishing policies and
   guidance to participants in the federal labor-management relations
   program, the Authority also assists federal agencies and unions in
   understanding their rights and responsibilities under the Statute, and
   actively encourages, through its Collaboration and Alternative Dispute
   Resolution Program the use of alternative dispute resolution, to allow
   the parties to resolve their problems without adjudication. The
