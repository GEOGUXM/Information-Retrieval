     Recipient No. 436040

     Dear Ms. Asbury:

     This report (INP-01-008) provides the results of our inspection of
     the Legal Aid Society of Greater Cincinnati's client trust fund
     account at the main office and at the Hamilton branch office. The
     inspection focused on compliance with record keeping requirements
     established in the LSC Accounting Guide For LSC Recipients
     (Accounting Guide).

     The on-site inspection was conducted on September 17 through
     September 20, 2001. The inspection determined that Legal Aid Society
     of Greater Cincinnati generally complied with the LSC Accounting
     Guide. However, internal controls should be improved in the
     following areas:

    1. Outstanding Checks. Four checks issued by the main office totaling
       $108 remained outstanding for over two years. LSC recommends that
       checks outstanding over 60 days be cancelled. The grantee does not
       have procedures to follow up when checks remain outstanding for
       long periods of time. We suggest that the grantee adopt a policy
       requiring a monthly review of outstanding checks. A letter should
       be sent to clients that do not cash checks within two months. If
       the clients cannot be located the checks should be voided.
    2. General Ledger. The grantee did not post client trust fund
       transactions to the General Ledger on a monthly basis as required
       by the Accounting Guide (pages 36, 75). The client trust fund
       account is posted at year end to the general ledger. We suggest
       these transactions be posted on a monthly basis.
    3. Oversight. The main office staff did not maintain adequate
       oversight of the Hamilton branch office's client trust fund
       account. The main office receives and reviews the Hamilton office's
       bank statement and does the check reconciliation. However, the
       Hamilton office does not provide documentation to support the
       receipts and disbursements. The main office staff told us that the
       Hamilton office's client trust fund was reviewed twice a year. The
       reviews were not documented. To improve oversight of the account,
       we suggest that each month the Hamilton branch office provide the
       main office backup documentation for all receipts and
       disbursements. The documentation should be compared to the
       transactions reflected in the monthly bank statement.
    4. Escheat Policy. The grantee had not escheated $337 to the state of
       Ohio as required by state regulations. This amount constitutes the
       money in seven client accounts dating from 1993 to 1995. State law
       requires unclaimed funds to be escheated within five years. The
       grantee has not established policies and procedures for escheating
       funds. We suggest that the grantee establish a process to track
       unclaimed funds and submit them to the state in accordance with
       state escheat regulations.
    5. Financial Manual. The grantee is using an outdated financial policy
       manual. We suggest the manual be updated to reflect current
       policies.

     The grantee's comments on the draft report indicated agreement with
     the inspection's findings and suggestions with the exception of
     issuing separate receipt books. The grantee stated that it would be
     too costly to implement our suggestion. After considering the
     grantee's comments, we deleted the suggestion. The comments
     indicated that the other suggestions had been or would be
     implemented.

     Please provide a copy of this report to each member of the Board of
     Directors of the Legal Aid Society of Greater Cincinnati.

     Sincerely,

     Leonard J. Koczur
     Acting Inspector General
