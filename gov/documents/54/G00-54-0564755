Control the ABCs of Diabetes


   If you have diabetes, you are at very high risk for heart attack and
   stoke. But you can reduce your risk by controlling the ABCs of
   diabetes. The NDEP's new campaign, Be Smart About Your Heart: Control
   the ABCs of Diabetes, is designed to make people with diabetes aware of
   their high risk for heart disease and stroke and the steps they can
   take to lower that risk - dramatically. The campaign emphasizes
   managing blood glucose (best measured by the A1C test), blood pressure,
   and cholesterol. The NDEP's new brochure explains the ABCs of diabetes
   and provides a handy wallet card to help you track your ABCs.
