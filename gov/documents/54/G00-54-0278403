                          A Tool for Assessment of
                            Renewable Energy and
                         Energy Efficiency Projects

   What is ProForm?

   ProForm is a software tool designed to support a basic assessment of
   the environmental and financial impacts of renewable energy and energy
   efficiency projects. Given the necessary data, ProForm calculates basic
   financial indicators and avoided emissions of CO[2] and local air
   pollutants expected from a project.

   As a spreadsheet-based tool, ProForm is designed to be simple enough to
   be easily usable, yet sophisticated enough to provide credible results.
   A typical application of ProForm would be in preparation of a project
   proposal that the developers might submit to potential investors,
   financiers, or a national climate change office. ProForm allows project
   developers, financial institutions, and other parties to investigate
   how changes in basic assumptions affect the key parameters of a
   project.

   Types of Applications

   ProForm is designed for assessment of renewable energy and energy
   efficiency projects. ProForm can be used for renewable energy projects
   that involve either electricity generation or non-electric energy
   production, and for energy efficiency projects that save electricity
   and/or fossil fuels.

   Within the above categories, ProForm allows for assessment of:
     * Displacement of fossil fuel combustion associated with electricity
       production, and/or
     * Displacement of fossil fuel combustion at the end-use level.

   ProForm can be used for a project that involves a single installation,
   such as an energy efficiency improvement at a factory or an
   installation of a wind turbine, or for one that involves installation
   over time of multiple units of a technology, such as a residential
   lighting efficiency program.

   Basic Assessments by ProForm
     * Environmental assessment  ProForm calculates emissions of CO[2]
       and several local air pollutants that may be avoided as a result of
       a project. It allows the user to construct a baseline that can
       reflect changes in emissions impacts expected over the lifetime of
       the project.
     * Financial assessment  The financial assessment in ProForm is from
       the perspective of the sponsor of the project. A basic assessment
       considers a locally-owned project that sells carbon credits, while
       an advanced assessment can consider a project that has a foreign
       equity investor.

   Data Requirements

   ProForm requires basic performance and cost data for the technology to
   be installed, the number of units expected to be installed in each
   year, and data on the baseline technology that will be displaced as a
   result of the project. For projects that will displace grid
   electricity, the user can estimate the extent to which various types of
   electricity generation will be affected. In addition to technology cost
   data, the financial assessment requires data on costs of any fuel
   inputs for the project, and of fuel use or electricity generation that
   will be avoided. ProForm is able to accommodate data on carbon credits,
   grants, or tax credits that may be associated with a project.

   Output from ProForm

   The main financial results are the projects IRR and NPV with and
   without revenue from carbon credits. By modifying assumptions regarding
   the value of carbon credits, the user can assess what the financial
   impact of these credits would be under varying future scenarios.
