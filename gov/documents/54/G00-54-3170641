   "The Effects of Globally Transported African and Asian Dust on Coral
   Reef and Human Health" is an eight minute mini-documentary featuring
   biologist Ginger Garrison, geologist Gene Shinn, chemist Chuck Holmes,
   and microbiologist Dale Griffin as they explain the deterioration of
   Caribbean coral health over the past several decades, and how unlocking
   the key role of trans-Atlantic dust transport has opened the door to
   understanding the effects and implications of this global phenomenon.
   Narrated by geologist Terry Edgar.

   Why have coral reefs that are bathed in clear oceanic waters throughout
   much of the Caribbean suffered algal infestation, coral diseases, and
   near extinction of herbivorous sea urchins from the 1970s through early
   1990s? The best known factors detrimental to coral reefs do not apply
   for many of the affected reefs where human population is low.

   The geology and and hydrology of the central Indian River region along
   the central east coast of Florida is of critical concern to the St.
   Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD). In this area the upward
   migration of deeper, more saline ground water in the lower Floridan
   aquifer to the shallower, fresher ground water of the upper Floridan
   aquifer and above, may impact the water quality of this resource.
