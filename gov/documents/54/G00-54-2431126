                          Rep. Bernard Sanders (I)
     [bio_vt01bernie.gif] Elected 1990; b. Sept. 8, 1941, New York, NY;
     home, Burlington; U. of Chicago, B.A. 1964; Jewish; married (Jane).

    Career: Writer; Dir., Amer. People's History Soc.; Burlington Mayor,
      1981-89; Lecturer, Harvard, 1989; Prof., Hamilton Col., 1989-90.

   Vermont's single House member is Bernie Sanders, a Socialist elected as
      an independent since 1990 but treated as a Democrat in the House.
     Sanders grew up in Flatbush, Brooklyn, the son of a paint salesman,
   became involved in radical politics at the University of Chicago, then
    came to Vermont as part of the hippie invasion of 1968. His rumpled,
   tieless, sincere persona helped him win election as mayor of Burlington
      in 1981 by 10 votes, after losing four statewide races. There he
    governed ably for eight years, using the city's prosperity to start a
   municipal day-care center, expand low- and moderate-income housing, put
   a pollution control facility on Lake Champlain and switch the tax base
       from property to hotel and restaurant fees and a utility tax on
    companies using certain public facilities. In 1988, when Congressman
   Jim Jeffords ran for the Senate, Sanders ran for the House and lost to
    Republican Peter Smith. Two years later he ran again and reversed the
     result by capitalizing on Smith's support of the 1990 budget summit
      agreement and his vote for the ban on semiautomatic weapons. The
       National Rifle Association came out against Smith, and Sanders'
    opposition to gun control-Vermont is the only state with no limits on
     gun ownership at allhelped this urban-based Socialist carry 227 of
   Vermont's 251 cities and towns, and three gores and one grant. Sanders
     became only the third Socialist elected to the House, after Victor
   Berger of Milwaukee (1911-13, 1923-29) and Meyer London of Manhattan's
   Lower East Side (1915-23), and the only Socialist elected by an entire
                                   state.

    Sanders's Socialist label doesn't matter much in the House. Initially
      Democrats balked at accepting him in their caucus, but they have
    granted him seniority as a Democrat since 199 1; when a Democrat had
      the effrontery to run against him in 1996, none less than George
     Stephanopoulos came to Burlington to speak at a Sanders fundraiser.
   House Democrats gave him the ranking minority position on a Government
   Reform subcommittee in 1997 over the objections of Elijah Cummings and,
     when a Banking subcommittee ranking position opened up in November
   1997, he got that over the claims of Carolyn Maloney. Sanders adds to a
     heavily liberal voting record his own particular stamp. He formed a
   Progressive Caucus, with 58 members in the 104th Congress, with what is
         for the moment a quixotic agenda: progressive tax reform, a
    Canadian-style single-payer health care system, a 50% cut in military
     spending over five years, a national energy policy and-here Vermont
   speaks-support for family farms (including opposition to bovine growth
     hormone). He decries the tumbling of the barriers to international
     capital movement, and says the world economy is growing more slowly
        than at any time in the last 30 years; he joined conservative
     Republicans in voting against IMF funding. Why has he not become a
    Democrat? "Here is the Democratic Party, a party which prided itself
   for 60 years on defending the interests of working people and the poor,
   making a radical shift to the right, and accepting policy which Richard
   Nixon would have summarily rejected," writes Sanders in his biography,
                           Outsider in the House.

       But Sanders has also been a practical and sometimes successful
    legislator, gaining Republican allies in targeting what they consider
     corporate welfare. With Chris Smith of New Jersey, for example, he
     passed an amendment barring Defense spending for defense contractor
   mergers ("payoffs for layoffs"), and he passed another barring defense
     spending on bonuses for defense contractor executives. With Budget
   Chairman John Kasich, he got the House to pass a threeyear phaseout of
      OPIC, which provides risk insurance for foreign investments. With
     Gerald Solomon, whose Upstate New York district borders Vermont, he
     battled Wisconsin's Steven Gunderson who was trying to end the milk
       marketing system; and he was the House's leading backer of the
   Northeast Dairy Compact, which Senator Patrick Leahy got into the 1996
   Freedom to Farm Act; he backed the Vermont-Maine-Texas compact to send
     nuclear waste to Sierra Blanca, Texas. He got Majority Leader Dick
   Armey to agree to a vote in the 105th Congress banning "gag rules," HMO
       directives to doctors not to mention procedures not covered by
    insurance. He has passed amendments requiring U.S. representatives on
   the IMF to insist on workers' rights (but none ever has voted against a
     loan for this reason, he notes) and banning import of goods made by
     indentured child labor. He co-sponsored the 1998 law criminalizing
   identity fraud. He has called for a "Manhattan-type project on Gulf war
    illness," and for satellite TV subscribers to receive local stations.
