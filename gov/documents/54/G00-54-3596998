   2.    Can I send comments to OAL about a regulation that OAL is reviewing or
   other proposed regulations ?

      No.

      OAL cannot accept comments on proposed regulations. Comments on
      proposed regulations must go directly to the agency which is proposing
      them. There is an exception for emergency regulations which allows you
      to comment both directly to the agency and to OAL.

   3.    Can OAL give me legal advice?

      No.

      OAL does not provide legal advice. OAL can answer questions on the
      statutes and regulations governing California rulemakings (see
      Government Code section 11340 et seq. and Title 1, CCR, section 1 et
      seq.) and the status of regulations filed with OAL. For information on
      the APA, OAL's regulations, or the status of regulations filed with
      OAL, you may contact us at staff@oal.ca.gov.

      We cannot answer questions about unrelated legal matters such as
      divorce and we cannot give other legal advice. For help with legal
      problems, please call your local Bar Association's lawyer referral
      service. In Sacramento, the number for referral to an attorney is (916)
      444-2333.

   4.    Where can I find the California Code of Regulations (CCR)?

      The CCR is available at the offices of County Clerks or County Law
      Libraries and 100 state depository libraries. It is available in
      loose-leaf form from the publisher, West Group. For information,
   contact West Group at 1-800-888-3600.

5.    How does OAL count time ?

   With one exception, OAL follows the basic rule of Government Code
   section 6800 (also Civil Code section 10). The law provides that
   whenever an act is to be done, you compute the time by excluding the
   first day and including the last, unless the last is a weekend or
   holiday [defined in the Civil Code], and then it is also excluded,
   unless the law provides otherwise.

   Example: By law, OAL has ten days to review and approve or disapprove
   proposed emergency regulations. An agency submits emergency regulations
   to OAL on Wednesday, March 5, 1997. Excluding the first day, Day 1 of
   the ten days is Thursday. Day 10 falls on Saturday, March 15th.
   Excluding the weekend or holidays, the due date will fall on Monday,
   March 17th. The only exception for OAL is that OAL has 30 working days
   to complete the review of a non-emergency regulation filing, so
   weekends and holidays which fall during the thirty-day period are
   excluded.

6.    Is the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) the same as the Office of
Administrative Hearings?

   No. OAL is not the same as OAH.

   OAL carries out the rulemaking part of the Administrative Procedure Act
   (APA) which allows executive branch state agencies to adopt rules and
   regulations.

   The Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) in the Department of
   General Services administers the administrative adjudication part of
   the Administrative Procedure Act regarding proceedings such as license
   revocation hearings which follow APA hearing procedures.

   OAL does not conduct administrative hearings.

7.    What are "administrative" or rulemaking" agencies ?

   Like the United States government, the government of California is
   divided into three separate and distinct branches or departments--the
   legislative, executive, and judicial. The Legislature is made up of the
   Senate and the Assembly whose members are elected by the citizens of
   the State. The judiciary includes the court system, including the trial
   courts, Courts of Appeal, and the California Supreme Court.

   The California Constitution and the statutes enacted by the Legislature
   create the various agencies, departments, offices, commissions, boards,
   and so on to carry out the laws found in statute. These "state
   agencies" have and exercise the power granted to them by both statutes
   and the California Constitution. These powers often include
   "rulemaking" or the making of rules and regulations in order to carry
   out their other duties.

8.    What is the difference between a regulation and a statute ?

   The Legislature enacts statutes. The People of the State may also enact
   statutes and constitutional provisions.

   Administrative agencies adopt, amend and repeal regulations under the
   authority granted to them by either constitutional provisions or
   statutes. Unless the Legislature has created an exemption, agencies
   must follow the procedures in the Administrative Procedure Act when
   adopting, amending or repealing regulations.

9.    Does OAL review statutes ?

   No.

   OAL does not review statutes enacted by the Legislature.

10.    Can I ask for a change in an agency's regulation ? How do I do it ?

   You may ask an agency to repeal or amend an existing regulation, or to
   adopt a new regulation by petitioning the agency, using the method
   described in Government Code sections 11340.6 and 11340.7. A petition
   is simply a letter which requests the change and contains certain
   information. Specifically, the petition must identify the nature of the
   regulation change you are asking for; it must state the reason for the
   change you are requesting; and it must identify the agency's rulemaking
   power (a reference to the law giving the agency the power to adopt
   rules and regulations).

   By law, a state agency must respond to a petition within 30 days. The
   agency's decision will be published in the California Regulatory Notice
   Register. See Government Code sections 11340.6 and 11340.7 which spell
   out the complete process.

   an exception for emergency regulations. Please send any comments on
   proposed regulations directly to the agency proposing them.
