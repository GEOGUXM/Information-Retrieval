Records Schedules Available for Public Comment

   NARA publishes notices in the Federal Register of proposed Federal
   agency records schedules that are available for public comment before
   NARA approves the schedule. Once approved by NARA, records schedules
   provide mandatory instructions on what happens to records when they are
   no longer needed for current Government business. The schedules
   authorize the preservation of records of continuing value in the
   National Archives of the United States and the destruction, after a
   specified period, of records lacking administrative, legal, research,
   or other value.

   NARA invites the public to request copies of the schedules and NARA
   appraisal memorandums on those schedules, and to submit comments on
   them. Current notices for which the comment period is open are:
     * 12/10/01 Notice published on page 63725.
       Deadline for requesting copies: 1/24/02.
     * 1/2/02 Notice published on page 114.
       Deadline for requesting copies: 2/19/02.
     * 1/23/02 Notice published on page 3237.
       Deadline for requesting copies: 3/11/02.

Other NARA Requests for Public Comment

   NARA is seeking public comment on the Report on Current Recordkeeping
   Practices within the Federal Government. The report is an analysis of
   two significant data collections that were conducted by NARA and SRA
   International, Inc. to assess the state of recordkeeping and records
   use in the Federal Government. This is an important step in NARA's
   efforts to review and, if necessary, revise records management policies
   and guidance to fit the changing office environment.

     Comments are due by January 31, 2002.
     Please send comments to comments@nara.gov, or fax them to
     301-713-7270, or mail them to NARA (NPOL), 8601 Adelphi Rd. Rm.
     4100, College Park, MD 20740-6001

   NARA publishes notices in the Federal Register periodically to request
   public comment on other proposed actions. The following notices have
   been published for comment:
     * Information Collection. Notices on proposed information collections
       (e.g., forms and surveys completed by non-Federal entities and
       individuals) describe the collection, how we will use the
       information, and our estimate of the reporting burden to
       respondents.
       The following proposed information collection has been published in
       the Federal Register for public comment:
          + 12/03/01 Notice published on page 60225.
            Comments are due by 02/01/02.
