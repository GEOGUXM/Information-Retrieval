   TIPSshdw.gif (9377 bytes) Electronic Permitting Initiative


   Using computers and computer applications has become the way of doing
   business in today's office environment. Text, laboratory and field
   data, including maps and data bases, are generated and captured in
   computer systems; any related environmental and engineering analyses
   are performed with computers using specific softwares.

   The focus of OSM's electronic permitting initiative's is to provide
   permit reviewers computer-based tools and methodologies to access
   readily useable electronic documents, maps and data, and to perform
   necessary technical and environmental analyses applying sound science
   principles. Additional benefits include the ability to share data with
   managers, field personnel, with other agencies and public.

   Electronic permitting is the ability to utilize all aspects of the
   electronic work environment -- capturing or creating documents or text,
   maps, and data in electronic format in order to:

   1.   easily transfer to any location or computer system,

   2.   provide easy access (including public access),

   3.   allow modifications to suit the user's needs,

   4.   allow review and processing of the data, and

   5.   facilitate efficient archiving into appropriate data bases or
   storage systems for future use.
