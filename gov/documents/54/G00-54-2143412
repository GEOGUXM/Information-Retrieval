   Radio Address by the President to the Nation

   FOR RELEASE:
   January 19, 2002 Contact: Public Affairs
                    (202) 401-3026



    "Our challenge is to make sure that every child has a fair chance to
   succeed in life. That is why education is the great civil rights issue
                               of our time."

      The White House Office of the Press Secretary released the following
      text of the Radio Address by the President, embargoed until delivery at
      10:06 a.m. EST Saturday.

      THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. On Monday, communities across America will
      celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Laura will
      visit Atlanta to commemorate the day in Dr. King's home town. I will
      welcome Dr. King's family to the White House. This year's observance is
      an opportunity to celebrate the contributions of Dr. King, and honor
      the principles for which he lived and died.

      Americans can proudly say that we have overcome the institutionalized
      bigotry that Dr. King fought. Now our challenge is to make sure that
      every child has a fair chance to succeed in life. That is why education
      is the great civil rights issue of our time.

      So my administration worked with Republicans and Democrats to enact
      into law the most far-reaching educational reform in a generation. We
      are insisting on high standards for all our children. We're putting a
      new emphasis on reading as the first step toward achievement. We're
      offering teachers new training, and states and localities new
      flexibility. And we're going to measure and test how everyone is doing
      in our new accountability system, so we can get help to children before
      it is too late.

      We have a special obligation to disadvantaged children to close the
      achievement gap in our nation. In my next budget, I will propose an
      increase of $1 billion for the federal program that aids disadvantaged
      schoolchildren. That's on top of the 18-percent increase in last year's
      budget.

      In fact, federal spending on Title I will increase just about as much
      in the first two years of my administration as it did in all the
      previous eight years combined. I hope Congress will approve this
      request.

      At the same time as we fund Title I, we're giving extra help to
      children with special needs. The federal program for special needs
      children was established by the law known as IDEA, the Individuals With
      Disabilities Education Act. My 2003 budget requests an additional $1
      billion for IDEA, as well -- an important increase. But we want these
      new dollars to carry to

      special education the same spirit of reform and accountability we have
      brought to other education programs.

      This reform effort began Tuesday, when Education Secretary Rod Paige
      convened the first meeting of the new presidential commission on
      excellence in special education. This distinguished and diverse group,
      chaired by former Iowa Governor Terry Brandstad, has a clear mission --
      to propose reforms that will make special education an integral part of
      an education system that expects all children to reach their full
      potential.

      We must have high expectations for children who are more difficult to
      teach or who have fallen behind. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. would
      accept no less than an equal concern for every child in America, and
      neither will my administration.

      Thank you for listening.

                                        ###
