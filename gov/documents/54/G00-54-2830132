   USGS presence at BSA Jamboree

   Gary Speiran, hydrologist in Richmond, Va., shows Boy Scouts the
   equipment used to collect
   water-quality samples. USGS personnel from Virginia and other states
   staffed an exhibit on the
   Conservation Trail at this yearâ€™s Boy Scout National Jamboree, which is
   held every four years at
   Fort A.P. Hill. The exhibit displayed information and equipment
   relating to USGS activities in water,
   biology, geology, and mapping.
