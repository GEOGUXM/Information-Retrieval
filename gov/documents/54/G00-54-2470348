      What you'll learn
      This 3-hour interactive forum addresses the establishment of interfaces
      between organizations for the purpose of emergency response. Forum
      content is based on DOE O 151.1 and DOE Guide 151.1-1 Volume III. This
      forum supports the learning objectives of the overview-level course,

      course material, case studies, and any questions or concerns of
      participants.

      Who will benefit
      This forum is intended for DOE managers, contractors, and any personnel
      with responsibility for planning, preparedness, and response to
      emergencies affecting DOE sites, facilities, and activities. Other
      personnel who should be invited to attend include off-site agency
      personnel who may be involved in establishing and maintaining DOE
      offsite response interfaces.

        * Examples of the documentation process.
