   Aerospace education is a "CAP Mission," just like Emergency Services
   and Cadet Program?

     Yes!  The authority for Civil Air Patrol's Aerospace Education and
     Training Mission is derived from Public Law 476, signed on 1 July
     1946.  The law states the objectives and purposes of CAP are "to
     provide an organization to encourage and aid American citizens in
     the contribution of their efforts, services, and resources in the
     development of aviation and in the maintenance of air supremacy..."
     and "to provide aviation education and training, especially to the
     senior and cadet members..."
     See CAPR 280-2

   How does CAP accomplish that mission?

     Civil Air Patrol Aerospace Education Programs implement the AE
     mission goals and objectives.  These AE programs provide an
     understanding and appreciation of aviation and space exploration in
     our world.   Aerospace Education is communicating knowledge, skills
     and attitudes relating to aerospace activities and the total impact
     of air and space technology upon society.

     See CAPR 280-2

   Okay, so it's a mission.  But I don't have to do anything personally.
   Right?

     Wrong!

     Civil Air Patrol members are obligated to involve themselves in
     aerospace education.  Members are required to

     (1) be informed on aerospace developments and issues.

     (2) speak out on aerospace matters at appropriate formal occasions
     and during informal daily contacts, and

     (3) share aerospace knowledge and experiences with CAP members and
     the general public.

     See CAPR 280-2

   (Some senior members might not be involved in the Cadet Program.  And
   some senior members and cadets might not be involved in Emergency
   Services.  But, according to CAP regulations, every member is obligated
   and required to help fulfill the CAP Aerospace Education mission.)



      Here's what CAP's Aerospace Education Mission is all about...


                     The CAP Aerospace Education Program

     CAP has an Internal Program that reaches out to its members, and an
       external program that reaches out to the general public.   This
      section defines the elements of that program, and the pages below
                help you to carry out elements of the program.

                       Aerospace Education Activities

           Every CAP Aerospace Education Activity should be fun and
     interesting.  The last thing that you want to do is to read from the
      Cadet AE handbook for an hour, or find somebody to drone on and on
        about what it was like to repair aeroplanes forty years ago...
       Instead, try some of these activities to capture the interest of
                                your students!

                         Aerospace Education Awards

       Do you know an individual or organization that is doing a really
       great job promoting aerospace education?  CAP has many awards to
          recognize those individuals - cadets, senior members, and
                              non-members, too!

                          Aerospace Education Links

     The internet offers many resources that can help you carry out CAP's
     Aerospace Education Mission.  Some helpful links are provided here.

                       Aerospace Education Membership

         An entire class of membership exists for people that want to
     participate in CAP's aerospace education mission, but don't want to
     become regular uniform-wearing active members.  This can be a great
         way to work with a local teacher who likes to use aerospace
              education materials and lessons in the classroom.

                     Aerospace Education Specialty Track

      Remember, every CAP member is required and obligated to help carry
      out our Aerospace Education Mission.  In fact, that mission is so
       important, many senior members choose to make implementing CAP's
     Aerospace Education Program their specialty. And, if you're already
      a professional educator that wants to become an AE officer in CAP,
      you can get some special promotions based upon your unique skills,
              just like pilots, chaplains, doctors and nurses...
