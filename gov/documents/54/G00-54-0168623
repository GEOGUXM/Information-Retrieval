   by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) unless otherwise noted.

Privacy

   The USGS web site which referred you to this document conforms to the
   general U.S. Department of Interior policy on privacy as outlined in
   the DOI Privacy Statement and as detailed below.

  How we handle the information we gather when you visit our web site-

    Web server activity logs

   Like most web servers on the Internet, our servers collect and store
   all of the information that your web browser sends when it requests a
   web page, including:
     * the name, domain, and numerical internet address of the "host"
       computer (typically a computer belonging to your Internet Service
       Provider and not your personal computer) from which you access the
       Internet. For example, your host computer's name is
       crawler.dlib.vt.edu and its numerical address is 128.173.49.57;
     * the date and time you accessed our site;
     * the Internet address of the web page that you came from (for this
       visit that address is (none));
     * the page you requested from our site and the number of characters
       sent to your computer; and
     * the information your web browser software sends as its so-called
       "User Agent," which typically identifies the browser software and
       may also indicate the operating system and type of CPU used in your
       personal computer. Your User Agent information is MultiText/0.1.

   It is impossible to determine the actual identity of an individual user
   from this information.

   The logs are periodically summarized and analyzed in order to study
   site usage over time and to perform other studies to help us improve
   the site's organization, performance, and usefulness.

    Electronic mail

   When you send us personal identifying information via e-mail (that is,
   in a message containing a question or comment, or by filling out a form
   that e-mails us this information), we use it to respond to your
   requests. We may forward your e-mail to other Government employees or
   contract personnel who are better able to answer your questions. We do
   not retain or distribute lists of e-mail addresses to any parties
   outside of the USGS except as necessary to conduct official U.S.
   Government business. In no event, do we distribute lists of e-mail
   addresses to non-Government entities.

    File transfer protocol (FTP)

   Many USGS sites using the file transfer protocol may also store your
   e-mail address if your web browser is configured to provide it. By
   default most web browser software does not send your e-mail address;
   this option is configured through your browser preferences. In Netscape
   Navigator, for example, this option must be set by you through the
   Advanced preferences category by the item labeled, "Send email address
   as anonymous FTP password."

    Online surveys

   When you voluntarily provide us with personal information as part of an
   online survey, we use it to perform various quantitative and
   qualitative analyses to improve customer service and satisfaction. We
   may forward the information collected to other Government employees or
   contract personnel to perform the actual analysis. You are under no
   obligation to participate in such surveys. Non-participation will not
   inhibit your use of our web site in any way. If you provided the
   information to us in error, you may request its removal at any time.

    Ordering products

   When you voluntarily provide us with personal information such as name,
   shipping and billing address, and credit card number when ordering
   products online, we use the information to fulfill your order. We may
   forward the information collected to other Government employees or
   contract personnel or to other computer systems (such as secure
   electronic commerce servers) to complete the requested transaction.

    Marketing information

   We may collect information from you, with your permission, that will
   allow us to provide various customer services, such as promotional
   materials and product availability notices. We may forward the
   information collected to other Government employees or contract
   personnel to provide specific marketing services. We will remove such
   information at your request.

    Collection and release of gathered information

   We want to make it clear that we will not obtain personal identifying
   information about you when you visit our web sites, unless you choose
   to provide such information to us. Except in the course of officially
   authorized law enforcement investigations, or in the event of a
   suspected attempt to deliberately circumvent our system's security with
   the intent to gain unauthorized access or to do physical damage (for
   example, an attack by hackers), we do not attempt to identify
   individual users or share any information we receive with any parties
   outside of the USGS. In the latter case, collected information
   associated with a suspected intruder might be shared through the USGS's
   Bureau Information Resources Security Administrator with an incident
   response service such as the CERT^Â® Coordination Center.

    Retention of collected information

   Cookies - Some applications may save a "cookie" on your computer's hard
   disk to provide a temporary history of actions taken. A common example
   is the tracking of items placed in an online "shopping basket." We do
   not retain any record of "cookies" beyond what is necessary for running
   the application.

   Web server activity logs - Monthly extracts of the log files are
   archived and stored off-line at our discretion for an indefinite period
   of time. Some statistical summaries derived from these data may be
   retained online or off-line at our discretion for an indefinite period
   of time.

   E-mail - Information collected via e-mail will be retained at our
   discretion in a directly readable form for as long as necessary to
   complete our response. The e-mail itself may be retained in an archival
   form as required by Federal laws and regulations governing the
   retention of historical records of government agencies. For more
   information, please refer to the National Archives and Records
   Administration's Records Management Program.

   Online surveys - Information collected via online surveys may be
   maintained at our discretion for an indefinite period of time.

   Marketing information - Such information may be maintained at our
   discretion for an indefinite period of time.
