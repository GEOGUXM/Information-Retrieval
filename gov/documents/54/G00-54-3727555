     __________________________________________________________________

   The Mission Services Program (MSP), locally known as Code 450, is a
   part of the Goddard Space Flight Center's Flight Projects and Program
   Directorate (aka Code 400). The MSP provides tracking and data services
   to a customer community comprised of low earth orbiting satellites
   (such as Hubble Space Telescope), the space shuttle, the space station,
   and expendable launch vehicles. The resources used to provide these
   services include a Space Network (SN) and a Ground Network (GN). The SN
   is comprised of a fleet of tracking and data relay satellites in
   geostationary orbit and a pair of ground terminals in White Sands, NM
   with an auxiliary antenna system on the Island of Guam. The GN is
   comprised of polar ground stations in Alaska and Norway and ground
   stations at Antartica, Wallops Island, VA, and Merrit Island, FL.
