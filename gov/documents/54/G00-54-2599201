        This issue of FoodReview presents a series of articles about

     * Consumer Preferences and Concerns Shape Global Food Trade--Twenty
       years ago, bulk commodities accounted for most agricultural trade.
       In recent years, processed and semi-processed foods have jointly
       accounted for two-thirds of total agricultural trade. Despite trade
       growth in developing countries, the much larger volume of processed
       food trade among developed countries has primarily accounted for
       the shift in world agricultural trade from grains to high-value
       foods. Factors influencing changes in global food trade include
       rising per capita incomes that cause consumers to seek out
       high-value foods, growth in two-way trade and intra-industry trade,
       developments in transportation technology, and urbanization. (87

     * Processed Food Trade Deficit Continues in 2000--U.S. processed food
       imports grew 5.9 percent in 2000 to a record high of $36.8 billion.
       In the same year, U.S. processed food exports grew 4.0 percent to
       $30 billion. The $6.8 billion trade deficit in 2000 marked the
       third consecutive year of progressively larger processed food trade
       deficits for the United States. In 2000, meatpacking retained its
       ranking as the top U.S. processed food export, growing 16.1 percent
       to $6.5 billion. Japan remained the top market for U.S. processed
       food exports. Fresh and frozen seafood repeated as the top U.S.
       processed food import in 2000, growing 10.5 percent to $7.8
       billion. With a 23-percent share, Canada was the largest source of
       U.S. processed food imports in 2000. (76 kb)
     * Imports' Share of U.S. Diet Rises in Late 1990s--Food imports
       account for a relatively small share of the total U.S. diet, but
       they grew considerably in importance during the late 1990s. ERS
       estimates that imports' share of the total quantity of food
       consumed domestically rose from an average of 7.5 percent for
       1979-94 and 7.4 percent for 1995 to 9.1 percent for 1998 and 1999.
       A strong U.S. economy, lower import prices, and U.S. participation
       in trade agreements, among other factors, contributed to the
       increase in imports in the last half of the 1990s. High-value
       products, such as seafood, red meat, cheese, fruits and juices,
       vegetables, beer, and wine, were among the fastest-growing U.S.
       imports and each increased significantly since 1995. (90 kb)
     * U.S. Food Companies Access Foreign Markets Through Investment--U.S.
       foreign direct investment (FDI) in foreign food processing
       companies grew from $9 billion in 1980 to $36 billion in 2000.
       Foreign food processing affiliates of U.S. companies generated $150
       billion in sales in 2000, compared with $30 billion generated by
       U.S. processed food exports. The United Kingdom, Mexico, and Canada
       had the most sales from U.S. FDI in 2000. Following a high of $8
       billion in 1996, foreign food company FDI in the U.S. processed
       food industry decreased to $1.5 billion in 2000. The largest
       foreign investments in U.S. companies were in grain and oilseed
       milling, dairy products, bakeries, tortilla-making plants, and
       beverages. (95 kb)
     * U.S. Exports Face High Tariffs in Some Key Markets--From 1996 to
       2000, U.S. food and agricultural exports averaged about $60.6
       billion per year. Tariffs imposed on U.S. food and agricultural
       exports in foreign markets had a dampening effect on the volume and
       value of this trade. Measuring the trade-distorting effects of
       tariffs is complicated, as it is a function of numerous factors,
       including the manner in which producers and consumers respond to
       changes in relative prices. This article identifies major markets
       in which U.S. agricultural exports face high tariffs and takes
       various approaches to computing the average tariff faced by U.S.
       agricultural exports in these markets. (100 kb)
     * Food Supply Nutrients and Dietary Guidance, 1970-99--In 1999, the
       available U.S. food supply contained more grain products, fruit,
       vegetables, and legumes, nuts, and soy products per capita than in
       1970. Likewise, per capita amounts of most nutrients in the U.S.
       food supply increased during 1970-99. In 1999, the food supply
       provided 111 more grams of carbohydrates per capita per day than in
       1970, although sugars and sweeteners provided almost 40 percent of
       the total amount. Per capita per day amounts of fiber increased 26
       percent, protein increased 16 percent, and total fat increased 8
       percent (although use of saturated fats decreased). In the same
       period, the food supply provided increased levels of iron, calcium,
       antioxidant vitamins, and B-vitamins (except B12). (87 kb)
     * Food Marketing Costs at a Glance--In 2000, U.S. consumers spent
       $661.1 billion on food, excluding imports and seafood. Estimated
       marketing costs for domestic farm goods in 2000 totaled $537.8
       billion, or 81 percent of consumer expenditures. From 1990 to 2000,
       consumer expenditures for farm goods rose $211.3 billion. In the
       same period, marketing costs rose 57 percent and accounted for most
       of the 47-percent rise in consumer spending. Labor used by
       manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and eating places totaled
       $253 billion in 2000 and accounted for nearly 40 percent of total
       consumer food expenditures. (59 kb)
