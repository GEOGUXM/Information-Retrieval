BIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH - Program Summary

                            [blue_green_line.gif]

   LLNL conducts multidisciplinary bioscience of high national importance.
   Our primary roles are to:
     * improve our understanding of the genome and its relationship to
       disease susceptibility;
     * advance healthcare; and
     * apply our expertise in support of national security and other
       laboratory programs.

   We execute our roles through synergistic, integrated programs that
   apply our competencies in:
     * genomics - the structural and functional characterization the DNA
       and the genes it encodes;
     * structural biology - the structure and function of proteins;
     * biomarkers - the identification and application of biological
       markers to understand susceptibility to disease;
     * bioinstrumentation - the application of physical and engineering
       technologies to laboratory automation, robotics, medical device
       development, and healthcare;
     * bioinformatics - databasing, networking, and analysis of biological
       data; and
     * computational biology - the application of high-speed computing
       technology to answer complex biological questions.

   We leverage the Laboratory's unique capabilities in the physical,
   computational and engineering sciences, and partner with both industry
   and universities.

Research Areas

   The Biology and Biotechnology Research Program is focused on three
   strategic thrust areas: genomics, disease susceptibility and
   prevention, bioengineering research. These thrust areas provide a set
   of core compentencies and a foundation for our laboratory-wide
   strategic plan in the biosciences.
   Genomics
   -- including the DOE Joint Genome Institute, functional genomics,
   comparative genomics, environmental and molecular microbiology, and
   mouse models for disease
   Molecular and Structural Biology
   -- including DNA repair, structural biology, molecular toxicology,
   genetic damage and disease, mechanisms of cancer, and computational
   biology
