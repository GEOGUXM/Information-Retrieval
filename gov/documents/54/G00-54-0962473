                              ComSci Fellowship

   The U.S. Department of Commerce Science and Technology Fellowship
   (ComSci) Program was established in 1964 to provide senior level
   executive branch employees (professional and management series) with an
   opportunity to study national and international issues relating to the
   development, application and management of science and technology.

   The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, which mandates the
   ComSci Program, gave management responsibility to the Secretary of
   Commerce. The program is administered by the Office of the Under
   Secretary for Technology.
