   Mission Operations

Payload Operations

   The Payload Operations Center at Marshall Space Flight Center is the
   world's primary science command post for the International Space
   Station, the most ambitious space research facility in human history.

   The Payload Operations team is responsible for managing all science
   research experiments aboard the Station. The center is also home for
   coordination of the mission-planning work of a variety of international
   sources, all science payload deliveries and retrieval, and payload
   training and payload safety programs for the Station crew and all
   ground personnel.

   State-of-the-art computers and communications equipment deliver
   round-the-clock reports from science outposts around the planet to
   systems controllers and science experts staffing numerous consoles
   beneath the glow of wall-sized video screens. Other computers stream
   information to and from the Space Station itself, continuously linking
   the orbiting research facility with the science command post on Earth.

   The Payload Operations Center continues the historic role Marshall has
   played in the management and operation of NASA's on-orbit science
   research. In the 1970s, Marshall managed the science program for
   Skylab, the first American space station, Spacelab -- the international
   science laboratory carried to orbit in the late '70s by the Space
   Shuttle for more than a dozen missions -- was the prototype for
   Marshall's Space Station science operations.
