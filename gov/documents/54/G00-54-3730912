                              Mission Statement
                          U.S. Flag flat-line shape

   For over sixty years, the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
   have enjoyed a strong relationship based upon mutual respect and common
   interests. Diplomatic relations were established in 1933. The U.S.
   Embassy opened in Jeddah in 1944 and moved to Riyadh in 1984. In
   addition to the Embassy, the American government maintains consulates
   in Jeddah and in Dhahran. The United States and Saudi Arabia share a
   common concern for regional security, oil exports and imports, and
   sustainable development. Close consultations between the U.S. and Saudi
   Arabia have developed on international, economic, and development
   issues such as the Middle East peace process and shared interests in
   the Gulf. The U.S. is Saudi Arabia's largest trading partner, and Saudi
   Arabia is the largest U.S. export market in the Middle East. The United
   States and Saudi Arabia have a history of technical and educational
   exchange which has benefited both nations, and the longstanding
   security relationship continues to be important. As the twenty-first
   century dawns, the vibrancy of the U.S.-Saudi relationship, based on
   multifaceted interests in the political, economic, business and
   humanitarian fields, remains secure.
