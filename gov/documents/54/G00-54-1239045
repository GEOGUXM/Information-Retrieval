   Introduction

      The Upper Illinois River Basin in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin is
      one of more than 50 study units that are part of the U.S. Geological
      Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program. The
      long-term goals of this program are to describe the status and trends
      in the quality of a large, representative part of the Nation's surface-
      and ground-water resources, and to provide a sound, scientific
      understanding of the primary factors affecting the quality of these
      resources.

      The Upper Illinois River Basin (UIRB) study began in 1997 and was one
      of the NAWQA Pilot studies from 1986 to 1992.
