   Nifty maps displaying different resources and information on the
   planets under review. Your maps might look very nice wrapped as
   terrains around our planets on the UBUBU's desktop replacement worlds.

   Great site. I love how much information you're presenting but of course
   it is a LOT. I noticed that Dr. Schatten's page at
   http://denali.gsfc.nasa.gov/926/schatten/sunpredlatest.htm is still
   around. Dr. Ken is of course no longer with NASA. Is there a more
   recent update to the solar cycle prediction and if so WHERE do I find
   it?

   Your site is pretty good. I was specifically intrested in the
   Pathfinder pictures and documents about the MARS missions. I am also
   intrested in your tectonic plate pictures. Ireally like this site. All
   in all, it is really good. You should write to schools telling them a
   short desription. They will use your site to teach students about
   Biological and geological classes. Good site.

   Interesting and informative. I was with RCA in the early '70s working
   on a NASA project to measure techtonic plate movement utilizing pulsed
   lasers ranging off a common satellite to provide a triangulated
   baseline crossing a fault line. is that program still working? if u
   could e-mail me an answer i would appreciate it. keep up the good work
   here.

   For many Decades, I have been contemplating Theories of interplantary
   Travel..The Types of vehicles that could very well enhance the
   Future..Many of the facts are that of Theory..But the practical aspects
   of them, do have many avenues to research on.. Keep this in mind..The
   Things that I have done in this area have been kept primarily to
   myself..In many discussions with Scientists, I have found that my
   concepts have valid theortical thoughts that may be refreashing for the
   Mind...The Avenue of limited space travel with limited speed, is the
   key...It was in the early 60's and is still valid this day...But not
   many have even come close to the possibilities of the areas I have
   studyed in the past 30 plus years...I seek no compensatoin for these
   concepts..I just would like to introduce a new way at looking at this
   age old problem if Speed and the Energy's that could be used in these
   missions to distant Galaxys...I you could possibly, get this to someone
   in NASA and or Group within NASA, I would appreciate it..
