     The US Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station is seeing a great deal of
   construction activity these days. Years of planning are finally coming
   to fruition as the steel frame of the new station rises out of the snow
   and ice of the polar plateau. More pictures of the construction can be
   found here. From mid April until September don't be surprised to find a
     black photo.  The sun is below the horizon for roughly six months.
   During the summer months you can see the Dome, Sky Lab (orange building
   left of  the dome), and the new station under construction, anticipated
                              completion 2005.
