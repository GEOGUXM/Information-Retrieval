                         Welcome to the JSC LTP Site

                 The NASA JSC Learning Technologies Project

                          Accessibility Information
     __________________________________________________________________

   One purpose of the Learning Technologies Project is to communicate
   information about NASA science and technology to the broadest possible
   audience, including persons with disabilities. We continuously check
   our HTML pages to maintain compliance with accepted guidelines for
   compatibility with assistive technology. However, our site includes
   advanced web-based applications which are intended to deliver 3-D
   visual content and, to our knowledge there is no assistive technology
   that renders this type of content into a form accessible to a screen
   reader. If you use a screen reader there is still much other content
   accessible to you and we believe this other content to be well worth
   your time. If you have suggestions, questions, need assistance, or have
   knowledge of any technology that might make this site more accessible,
   please send mail to info@prime.jsc.nasa.gov.
