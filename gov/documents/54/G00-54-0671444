   OBJECTIVES:
   Increase the safety, accuracy and efficiency of semi-autonomous /
   autonomous spacecraft rendezvous and docking:

   Neurocontrol technologies that can learn in near real-time the mass
   property of a spacecraft and its changes, and can compensate for
   thruster strength degradation, thruster failures, and uncontrolled
   venting (e.g. uncontrolled gas venting on Apollo 13 resulting from an
   onboard explosion), will make semi-autonomous / autonomous spacecraft
   navigation, rendezvous and docking safer, more accurate, faster, and
   more fuel efficient. Moreover, docking to a moving target will be
   possible.

   The Smart Systems Research Lab at NASA Ames Research Center is
   developing adaptive neurocontrol technologies to safely, accurately and
   efficiently dock a spacecraft to a target under a wide range of
   difficult operating conditions. The MIR accident that occurred is an
   example of the kind of disaster that can take place if docking is not
   done optimally. Difficult operational scenarios include 1) docking a
   spacecraft when its thruster strengths are not well known, stuck or
   leaking, 2) docking a spacecraft whose mass property is not well known,
   3) rendezvous and capturing a disabled spinning satellite, 4) docking a
   spacecraft to a spinning target, and (5) docking a spacecraft when some
   of its sensors become inoperable or fail. Operating a spacecraft under
   these conditions is a complex and dangerous task.

   We are developing neurocontrol technologies to operate under these
   difficult operating conditions, and are applying them in various
   operational modalities, ranging from computer-aided joystick control,
   semi-automated docking, and fully automated docking.

   Conventional automated docking approaches work well only when an
   accurate mathematical model of the spacecraft is available. In the
   operational scenarios described above, an accurate mathematical model
   is not available. The approach being applied is to use advanced
   identification technologies and adaptive neurocontrol to provide
   optimal control of the spacecraft. These development efforts merge
   adaptive neural network technologies with conventional feedback control
   techniques to handle problems in system identification and control of
   nonlinear systems. This approach does not require a mathematical model
   of the spacecraft a priori but instead it effectively learns an
   accurate model of the spacecraft from its behavior. The controller uses
   gathered data from a set of navigational sensors to quasi-statically
   learn an accurate model of the spacecraft performance. In this manner,
   the controller can control the spacecraft under a variety of changing
   conditions such as varying mass, changing center-of-mass location,
   thruster degradations/failures, uncontrolled venting, and sensor
   failures. Optimization methodologies are then used to achieve optimal
   performance.
