Hardware
Platforms

   Open Nirvana Cluster

   Little Blue Penguin Cluster


   The ACL provides its users access to a unique computing environment
   which includes
     * the largest unclassified computer in the world: the ACL Nirvana
       Machine, a 1-TeraOp peak speed SGI Origin 2000 system with one half
       TeraByte of memory
     * the Little Blue Penguins cluster, a 128-node Pentium Pro cluster
       system running the Linux operating system and interconnected with
       Myrinet
     * the largest unclassified, integrated visualization system in the
       world centered around 10 clustered SGI Infinite Reality systems
       attached directly to the ACL Nirvana Machine

Software
and Visualization

   Object-oriented Frameworks

   Scalable Run-time Systems

   Scientific Visualization

   Software Component Architecture





   The ACL provides cutting-edge scalable software and advanced
   visualization capabilities for high-performance computing. All of the
   software technologies developed at the ACL run on the SGI and Linux
   systems, and most ACL software packages are available for non
   commercial use at your local institution. The ACL is a leading national
   institution in several areas of computer science including the
   development of:
     * portable parallel software, which allows our users to develop codes
       that scale to thousands of processors with minimal effort
     * scalable run-time systems for clustered SMP systems of thousands of
       processors
     * scalable visualization environments to enable the interactive
       rendering of terabytes of data in a variety of modalities
     * systems integration science to address the challenges of
       integrating teraflops of CPU power, terabytes of memory and disk,
       and terabits of high-speed interconnections into a balanced
       supercomputing solution for the ACL community
