   The Office of Inspector General was established as an independent
   entity on March 29, 1989. As set forth in the Inspector General Act of
   1978 (Public Law 95-452), as amended, the Office of Inspector General
   provides independent and objective audits and investigations relating
   to agency programs and operations. The OIG provides leadership and
   coordination, and recommends policies to prevent and detect fraud and
   abuse in agency programs and operations. The Inspector General also
   provides a means for keeping the Chairman, Commissioners and the
   Congress fully informed about problems and deficiencies at the agency.
   The Inspector General reports to, and is under the general supervision,
   of the FCC Chair.

   The OIG has dedicated itself to assisting the Commission as it
   continues to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. The Inspector
   General informs the Chairman and Congress of fraud or any serious
   problems with the administration of FCC programs and operations
   discovered during audits, investigations and reviews. The Inspector
   General recommends corrective action, where appropriate, and reports on
   progress made in the implementation of actions. The IG refers criminal
   matters to the Department of Justice for potential prosecution and
   coordinates referrals to managers for administrative action by the
   agency. The office is staffed by the Inspector General - H. Walker
   Feaster III, an Assistant Inspector General for Investigations who acts
   as Counsel to the IG, an Assistant Inspector General for Audits, an
   Assistant Inspector General for Policy and Planning, four audit
   directors, and two senior auditors.
