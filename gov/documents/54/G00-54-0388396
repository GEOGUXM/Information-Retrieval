            FIRST CONFERENCE TO EXPLORE IMPACT OF DIGITAL ECONOMY

   Leaders from industry, academia and government will meet on May 25-26
   at the U.S. Department of Commerce in the first public conference to
   discuss methods to measure the impact of the Internet and the World
   Wide Web on the US economy and society.

   This conference -- "Understanding the Digital Economy -- Data, Tools
   and Research," -- is a direct result of President Clinton's November
   1998 directive to analyze the economic implications of the Internet and
   electronic commerce. Agenda items will focus on the state of research
   on the digital economy and what is needed to monitor its future
   development.

   Neal Lane, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and
   Secretary of Commerce William Daley will deliver keynote addresses.

   "The digital economy - defined by the changing characteristics of
   information, computing, and communications - is now the preeminent
   driver of economic growth and social change," said Lane. "With a better
   understanding of these fundamental transformations, we can make wiser
   decisions - whether we are investing in research, products, or
   services, or are adapting our laws and policies to the realities of a
   new age."

   The conference will examine the most recent research on the scale,
   direction, and significance of the emerging digital economy; engage the
   private sector in identifying research, tools, indicators, and data
   collection; and promote an open research agenda for better
   understanding the growth and implications of information technology and
   electronic commerce.

   "The proportion of retailers selling on the Internet tripled in just
   one year, from 12 percent in 1997 to 39 percent in 1998. In the year
   2000, Internet shopping is expected to generate $30 billion," Secretary
   Daley said. "As e-tailing takes off, retailers, manufacturers, and
   investors will have a need for ever more accurate statistics."

   registration are posted at: www.digitaleconomy.gov.
