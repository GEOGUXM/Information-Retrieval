     __________________________________________________________________

      The Center for Scientific Review (CSR) is committed to making every
      document on its World Wide Web sites accessible to the widest possible
      audience, including persons with visual disabilities. We have tried to
      the maximum extent feasible to ensure that our documents are accessible
      to persons using special screen reading software and hardware. While
      the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) used to create World Wide Web
      pages is generally accessible for persons using screen reading devices,
      care must be taken in the construction of HTML documents to insure
      maximum accessibility. A good description of the elements of accessible
      Web pages is found in The National Federation of the Blind's Guidelines
      For Web Page Accessibility and the Trace Research Center of the
      University of Wisconsin's Unified Web Site Accessibility Guidelines.

      Web-builders are also encouraged to utilize Bobby, a Web-based public
      service offered by the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST)
      that analyzes Web pages for their accessibility to people with
      disabilities, as well as their compatibility with various browsers.
      [approved32.gif] The analysis of accessibility is based on the working
      draft of the W3C's WAI Page Author guidelines with the Page Authoring
      Working Group's latest revisions. All pages on your Web site must meet
      these requirements in HTML 4.0 to display the "Bobby Approved" icon, a
      friendly uniformed police officer wearing a helmet displaying the
      wheelchair access symbol and extending his open right hand.

   Reading Acrobat Files with a Screen Reader

      Many of the documents on our Web sites are Adobe Acrobat PDF (Portable
      Document Format) files. Persons using screen reading devices generally
      cannot directly read documents in PDF format. Adobe Systems, Inc.,
      provides a free translation service through their Access Web pages
      which will translate PDF files to Web pages (HTML documents). This can
      be used in one of three ways:
        * The user can go to the Access server and fill out a form. When this
          form is submitted, the server will go get the PDF document,
          translate it, and return it to the user. [Instructions]
        * The user can send an email message to the Access server, giving the
          address of the document to be translated. If the Adobe PDF is on
          the Internet, e-mail the URL (that is, the Web address) of the PDF
          in the body of an email message to pdf2txt@adobe.com (for plain
          text) or to pdf2html@adobe.com (for HTML). The convertor will mail
          back the translation of the PDF file. Users can submit multiple
          URLs in a single e-mail. Note that this is the only one of the
          three options that also gives the ability to produce a text
          document from the PDF file. [Instructions]
        * For systems which are not connected to the Internet, Adobe has a
          free downloadable accessibility plug-in, called Adobe Access, for
          use with the latest versions of the Adobe Acrobat Reader for
          Microsoft Windows 3.1, Windows 95/98, or Windows NT. This plug-in
          helps to overcome some of the problems of reading PDF documents
          with screen readers, but for systems with Internet access, Adobe
          recommends using the on-line Access translation service instead.

      These methods of making PDF files accessible are adequate for many
      documents. However, they are not adequate for PDF documents in which
      content is included in graphic files, or for especially complex
      formatting. In these cases, CSR will try to provide an alternative
      format for use with screen readers.

      Comments on our accessibility policies are invited, and should be sent
      to the CSR Webmaster.
