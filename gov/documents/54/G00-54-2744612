                              Brief description

   The purpose of Coastal Ocean Forecast System (COFS) is to generate
   daily nowcasts (i.e. analysis) and short-term (of order of days)
   forecasts of ocean properties for the coastal ocean of the United
   States. The development of COFS for the U.S. East coast began in 1991
   and it was implemented as experimental real time forecasting system in
   August, 1993. COFS is based on hydrodynamic, three-dimensional ocean
   circulation model driven driven at the ocean surface boundary by heat,
   moisture, and momentum fluxes provided by NCEP's Eta mesoscale
   atmospheric forecast model. For description of COFS nowcast - two days
   forecast cycle contact COFS Description Site.

                                 Evaluation

   The daily output is undergoing evaluation by marine forecasters of
   NCEP's Marine Prediction Center in Camp Springs, MD. In addition, COFS
   products were evaluated as part of the Coastal Marine Demonstration
   Project in June and July, 1999 and February and March, 2000.
