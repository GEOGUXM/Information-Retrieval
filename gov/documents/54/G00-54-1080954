   [blueball.gif] NIST Surface Structure Database

      View sample illustrations of structures contained in the SSD database
      in the NIST SSD picture gallery.
      View statistics of the SSD database in graphical form:
        * SSD structures by year of publication, overall and by LEED
        * SSD structures by technique, overall and by year
        * SSD structures by material properties
        * SSD structures by author

   How were these pictures produced?
   Each '3D' picture in this gallery was prepared as follows:
   - the structure was constructed with program SARCH;
   - a PLOT3D (.PLT) file was output from SARCH;
   - using PLOT3D or (equivalently) BALSAC, a PostScript file was
   produced;
   - the PostScript file was converted to GIF format with commercial
   graphics software programs,
   using a transparent background.
   One may equally start from the SSD database, producing directly a
   PostScript file, or indirectly a PLOT3D file for postprocessing by
   BALSAC, as done for the NIST SSD gallery. For more information on
   SARCH, PLOT3D, BALSAC and SSD, please see the software and databases
   page.
   The '2D' views (projections) and graphs in this gallery were made with
   a variety of commercial software.
