                   NAME: William Douros
                   POSITION: Superintendent
                   TELEPHONE: (831) 647-4201
                   E-MAIL ADDRESS: william.douros@noaa.gov

   William J. Douros is the Superintendent of the Monterey Bay National
   Marine Sanctuary. His responsibilities at the Sanctuary include all
   aspects of management of the site and staff, interaction with the
   Sanctuary Advisory Council, and liaison to NOAA's and the National
   Marine Sanctuary Systems' leadership. Bill's past work and educational
   experience combines coastal policy, marine science and operational
   management. Immediately after graduating with a Master's degree in
   Marine Ecology from U.C. Santa Barbara in 1985, Bill worked for, and
   for seven years managed, Santa Barbara County's Energy Division, which
   regulates offshore oil and gas development in that county. Other skills
   Bill has from past jobs include bagging groceries, baking pizzas, and
   fighting forest fires.

   Bill's graduate work, conducted at Santa Cruz Island, examined
   intra-specific competition within extremely high density populations of
   black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii). He also evaluated archaeological
   remains to determine how pre-historic predation on abalone may have
   affected their population sizes. Bill has performed well over 500
   research dives for his own work and as a field assistant for others. He
   graduated with a bachelor's degree, with Honors, in Environmental
   Biology from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1981.

                NAME: Erica J. Burton
                POSITION: Research Specialist
                TELEPHONE: (831) 647-4246
                E-MAIL ADDRESS: erica.burton@noaa.gov

   As a Research Specialist, Erica Burton organizes scientific data and
   information for ecological monitoring projects ( rocky shores,
   beachcast seabirds and marine mammals, and kelp), updates the MBNMS
   Site Characterization document and bibliography, coordinates research
   meetings, and assists with web page development and design.

   Erica earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Marine Biology at Long
   Beach State University, and a Master of Science Degree in Marine
   Science at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML) and San Francisco
   State University. Her research focused on age, longevity, and growth
   determination of fishes. Her past work experience has primarily
   involved radiometric age determination of fishes including the giant
   grenadier, bocaccio rockfish, Atlantic tarpon, and Atlantic sturgeon.
   Recently, she collaborated with graduate students and researchers from
   MLML and California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) to conduct an
   extensive literature survey of nearshore fishes of California. In
   addition, a data matrix of known life history characteristics was
   constructed. The consolidation of life history information will aid
   CDFG, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Pacific Fisheries
   Management Council to manage and regulate the respective fisheries. The
   data matrix also identified major gaps in the knowledge of the life
   histories of these species, and will aid in prioritization of future
   research.
