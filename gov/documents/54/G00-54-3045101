                      About the Federal Bulletin Board

   The Federal Bulletin Board (FBB) is a free electronic bulletin board
   service of the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing
   Office (GPO). All file library documents can be downloaded free of
   charge.

   The FBB enables Federal agencies to provide to the public self-service
   access to Federal information in electronic form. The FBB runs in Web,
   FTP, and Telnet mode at Internet address fedbbs.access.gpo.gov. The FBB
   is a component of the GPO Access service and provides utility and
   support files for use with GPO Access online, searchable databases.

   Federal agencies use the FBB as a means to distribute electronic files
   in various file formats to the public. Users can access information
   from the White House and Executive Branch agencies (includes
   independent agencies) such as the Department of State and Treasury, the
   Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Federal Labor Relations
   Authority. Supreme Court opinions and files are also available from the
   1992 Term to the 1999 Term. The Federal Depository Library Program has
   information available on the FBB as well.
