   Prior to coming to LBL we established a Regional ICP-MS Facility at the
   Univeristy of Victoria. This facility is equipped with a VG PQS ICP
   mass spectrometer. The facility is presently open for trace element
   analysis of solution samples. Also, a Merchantek UV laser ablation
   solid sampling attachment has just been installed.
