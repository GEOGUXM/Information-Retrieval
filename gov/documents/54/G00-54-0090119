   Administrative Systems at ANL

   There are many administrative systems at Argonne National Laboratory
   concerned with the day-to-day operations of the laboratory. These range
   from very large and complex, serving clients lab-wide and beyond to
   those which are fairly simple, possibly single user applications. They
   have been categorized in various ways, but include accounting, budget,
   effort reporting, human resources, facilities management, etc.

   Several are described in more detail on our Administrative Systems home
   page.

   For a partial list of important systems along with the ECT-MIS section
