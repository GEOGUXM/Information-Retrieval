                     International Program Office (IPO)

     "..We have moved beyond Cold War definitions of the United States'
   strategic interests. Our foreign policy must now address a broad range
      of threats -- including damage to the world's environment -- that
     transcend countries and require international cooperation to solve.
   Environmental problems such as global climate change, ozone depletion,
   ocean and air pollution, and resource degradation -- respect no border
     and threaten the health, prosperity, and jobs of all Americans." --
                           Vice President Al Gore

   [IPO3.gif] The International Program Office (IPO) was established to
   serve as a single focal point for NOS-wide international activities and
   to coordinate cross-program international activities between NOS and
   national and foreign government agencies, non-governmental
   organizations, and donor organizations. The IPO serves as a bridge
   bringing together the wealth of expertise and technical capabilities of
   NOS program offices and the interests and needs of the global coastal
   and marine and science management community. In addition, the IPO
   fosters new partnerships among government agencies, non-governmental
   organizations, academia, and the private sector to increase awareness
   and to further the effective participation of stakeholders in planning
   and implementing international treaties, conventions, and agreements.
   IPO shares insights and ideas in coastal and marine management and
   science with other countries and regions to learn from each other's
   experiences, and enhances and increases international awareness of the
   programs and capabilities of the National Ocean Service and the
   benefits of its programs.


   [ipo1.gif] The IPO areas of focus include:
                * Integrated Coastal Management
                * Marine Protected Area Management
                * Mitigation of Climate Change Impacts
                * Safe, Efficient, and Environmentally Sound Maritime Navigation
                * Reduction of Natural Disaster Impacts
                * Science, Training, and Education.


  Vision:  To build and sustain capacities for global coastal and marine
           stewardship through effective international partnerships.
  Mission: To serve as a focal point for NOS international activities;
           provide a forum for exchanging ideas and new proposals; support the
           international interests and responsibilities of the NOS Assistant
           Administrator and Program Offices; provide a bridge among NOS, its
           Program Offices, and the international coastal stewardship community;
           and provide new incentives to NOS Program Offices for active
           participation in international activities.

   [IPO2.gif] The International Program Office is a staff office reporting
   directly to the Assistant Administrator of the National Ocean Service.
