   Frequently Asked Questions Elections in the state of Washington Why are
   results "unofficial" election night and not final? After election day,
   election officials must process and tabulate absentee ballots that were
   received on or after election day, process special ballots, and canvass
   the election. These tasks are completed up to the time of certification
   of the election. Primary Election results are certified ten days after
   the election; General Election results are certified fifteen days after
   the election. (See RCW 29.62.020) For the November 6, 2001 General
   election, County Canvassing Boards will certify their results on
   November 21st. Secretary of State Sam Reed must certify results of the
   statewide ballot measures by December 6th. (By law, the Secretary of
   State certifies all statewide ballot measures and contests that cross
   county lines.) Following election day, how often will ballots be
   counted and reported? At least every third day after an election,
   (excluding Sundays and holidays), County Auditors are required to
   tabulate absentee ballots if they are in possession of more than 25
   ballots. (See RCW 29.62.020) Why are ballots received and tabulated
   after election day? To be valid, absentee ballots must be postmarked by
   the day of the election. Ballots mailed on election day arrive at
   county election offices in the days following the election and then
   must be processed and tabulated prior to certification. (See RCW
   29.36.290, WAC 434-240-240) What are "special" ballots? Special ballots
   are issued to voters who appear at the polls and their name does not
   appear in the poll book, they were issued an absentee ballot, or there
   is a question regarding the issues or candidates that a voter is
   eligible to vote on. These ballots are separated from the rest of the
   ballots and not tabulated on election night. During the certification
   period following the election, officials research each special ballot
   to determine the eligibility of the voter. Special ballots are
   presented to the canvassing board at certification for determination on
   whether or not the ballot is counted based on the voter's eligibility.
   (See RCW 29.01.006) What triggers a recount? A mandatory recount is
   triggered if the difference between the top two candidates is fewer
   than 2000 votes and less than one-half of one percent. If the
   difference is fewer than 150 votes and less than one quarter of one
   percent, the ballots must be recounted manually. ( See RCW 29.64.015)
   When a mandatory recount is not required, a candidate, political party,
   or any group of five registered voters may request a recount. The
   request must be filed within three business days after the election
   results are certified. (See RCW 29.64.010) To request a machine
   recount, a deposit equal to fifteen cents for each ballot cast in the
   jurisdiction or portion of the jurisdiction for which the recount is
   requested must be filed along with the request for a recount. To
   request a manual recount, a deposit equal to twenty-five cents for each
   ballot must be filed along with the request for a recount. (See RCW
   29.64.020) What is canvassing the election? Canvassing an election is
   examining the ballots, and vote totals in order to determine the
   official returns for the election. (See RCW 29.01.008) The county
   canvassing board consists of the county auditor, prosecutor, and chair
   of the county legislative authority or their designee. (See RCW
   29.62.015) http://search.leg.wa.gov/wslrcw/RCW 29 TITLE/RCW 29 . 62

   Absentee ballots -- Unofficial returns. (1) At least every third day
   after a special election, primary, or general election and before
   certification of the election results, except Sundays and legal
   holidays, the county auditor shall convene the county canvassing board
   or their designees to process absentee ballots and canvass the votes
   cast at that special election, primary, or general election, if the
   county auditor is in possession of more than twenty-five ballots that
   have yet to be canvassed. The county auditor may use his or her
   discretion in determining when to convene the canvassing board or their
   designees during the final four days before the certification of
   election results in order to protect the secrecy of any ballot. Each
   absentee ballot previously not canvassed that was received by the
   county auditor two days or more before the convening of the canvassing
   board or their designees and that either was received by the county
   auditor before the closing of the polls on the day of the special
   election, primary, or general election for which it was issued, or that
   bears a date of mailing on or before the special election, primary, or
   general election for which it was issued, must be processed at that
   time. The tabulation of votes that results from that day's canvass must
   be made available to the general public immediately upon completion of
   the canvass. (2) On the tenth day after a special election or a primary
   and on the fifteenth day after a general election, the canvassing board
   shall complete the canvass and certify the results. Each absentee
   ballot that was returned before the closing of the polls on the date of
   the primary or election for which it was issued, and each absentee
   ballot with a date of mailing on or before the date of the primary or
   election for which it was issued and received on or before the date on
   which the primary or election is certified, shall be included in the
   canvass report. (3) At the request of any caucus of the state
   legislature, the county auditor shall transmit copies of all unofficial
   returns of state and legislative primaries or elections prepared by or
   for the county canvassing board to either the secretary of the senate
   or the chief clerk of the house. http://search.leg.wa.gov/wslrcw/RCW 29

   if: (1) It is returned in the return envelope; (2) The affidavit is
   signed by the registered voter to whom it was issued; (3) The signature
   has been verified by the county canvassing board; (4) It is postmarked
   not later than the day of the election or deposited not later than 8:00

   certification of the election. The canvassing board must compare the
   signature on the return envelope, or on a copy of the return envelope,
   with the signature as it appears on the voter's voter registration
   card. The canvassing board may designate in writing representatives to
   perform this function. All personnel assigned to the duty of signature
   verification shall subscribe to an oath administered by the county
   auditor regarding the discharge of his or her duties. Personnel shall
   be instructed in the signature verification process prior to actually
   canvassing any signatures. Local law enforcement officials may instruct
   those employees in techniques used to identify forgeries. For service
   voters, overseas voters, and out-of-state voters the date of mailing
   shall be the date indicated by the voter on the return envelope, and
   any envelope which shows a date subsequent to the date of the primary
   or general election shall be referred to the county canvassing board
   for disposition. For all other absentee ballots, the date of mailing
   shall be the postmark, if present and legible. If the postmark is not
   present or legible, the date of mailing shall be considered the date
   indicated by the voter on the return envelope. All absentee ballots
   showing a postmark subsequent to the date of the primary or election,
   or a date indicated by the voter subsequent to the date of the primary
   or election if the postmark is missing or illegible, shall be referred
   to the county canvassing board for their disposition. The signature
   verification process shall be open to the public, subject to reasonable
   procedures adopted and promulgated by the canvassing board to ensure
   that order is maintained and to safeguard the integrity of the process.

   auditor shall send each absentee voter a ballot, a security envelope in
   which to seal the ballot after voting, a larger envelope in which to
   return the security envelope, and instructions on how to mark the
   ballot and how to return it to the county auditor. The larger return
   envelope must contain a declaration by the absentee voter reciting his
   or her qualifications and stating that he or she has not voted in any
   other jurisdiction at this election, together with a summary of the
   penalties for any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter.
   The return envelope must provide space for the voter to indicate the
   date on which the ballot was voted and for the voter to sign the oath.
   A summary of the applicable penalty provisions of this chapter must be
   printed on the return envelope immediately adjacent to the space for
   the voter's signature. The signature of the voter on the return
   envelope must affirm and attest to the statements regarding the
   qualifications of that voter and to the validity of the ballot. For
   out-of-state voters, overseas voters, and service voters, the signed
   declaration on the return envelope constitutes the equivalent of a
   voter registration for the election or primary for which the ballot has
   been issued. The voter must be instructed to either return the ballot
   to the county auditor by whom it was issued or attach sufficient first
   class postage, if applicable, and mail the ballot to the appropriate
   county auditor no later than the day of the election or primary for
   which the ballot was issued. If the county auditor chooses to forward
   absentee ballots, he or she must include with the ballot a clear
   explanation of the qualifications necessary to vote in that election
   and must also advise a voter with questions about his or her
   eligibility to contact the county auditor. This explanation may be
   provided on the ballot envelope, on an enclosed insert, or printed
   directly on the ballot itself. If the information is not included, the
   envelope must clearly indicate that the ballot is not to be forwarded
   and that return postage is guaranteed. [2001 c 241 § 8; 1987 c 346 §

   reveals that the difference in the number of votes cast for a candidate
   apparently nominated or elected to any office and the number of votes
   cast for the closest apparently defeated opponent is less than two
   thousand votes and also less than one-half of one percent of the total
   number of votes cast for both candidates, the county canvassing board
   shall conduct a recount of all votes cast on that position. (a)
   Whenever such a difference occurs in the number of votes cast for
   candidates for a position the declaration of candidacy for which was
   filed with the secretary of state, the secretary of state shall, within
   three business days of the day that the returns of the primary or
   election are first certified by the canvassing boards of those
   counties, direct those boards to recount all votes cast on the
   position. (b) If the difference in the number of votes cast for the
   apparent winner and the closest apparently defeated opponent is less
   than one hundred fifty votes and also less than one-fourth of one
   percent of the total number of votes cast for both candidates, the
   votes shall be recounted manually or as provided in subsection (3) of

   may select an alternative method of conducting the recount. To select
   such an alternative, the two candidates shall agree to the alternative
   in a signed, written statement filed with the election official for the
   office. The recount shall be conducted using the alternative method if:
   It is suited to the balloting system that was used for casting the
   votes for the office; it involves the use of a vote tallying system
   that is approved for use in this state by the secretary of state; and

   by either telephone, fax, e-mail, or other electronic means at the time
   of mailing. At least three attempts must be made over a two-day period
   to notify the affected parties or until the affected parties have
   received the notification. Each attempt to notify affected parties must
   request a return response indicating that the notice has been received.
   Each person entitled to receive notice of the recount may attend,
