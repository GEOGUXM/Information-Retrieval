   Visitor Centers -- The Office of Water Education (OWE) designs and
       creates water education exhibits for use in visitor centers at
       State Water Project (SWP) facilities.
       These exhibits describe the importance of water in our state and
       how it is transported and used. They also explain the State Water
       Project and its aqueducts, reservoirs, pumping plants, powerplants,
       and other features.
       California state-wide issues such as water conservation, floods,
       droughts, and environmental uses are also the subject of Department
       of Water Resources exhibits.
       OWE assists and trains visitor center guides who are available
       onsite to explain the exhibits. OWE staff also coordinate special
       events at the visitor centers.
       Tours of SWP facilities are arranged by OWE staff for school
       classes, special interest groups, and for visitors from foreign
       countries.
