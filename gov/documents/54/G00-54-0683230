   [newcapitol.jpg] You will find easy access to valuable information
   about government in Louisiana, both state and local. All three branches
   of state government are represented: Executive, Legislative and
   Judicial. The Executive branch includes most state agencies, the
   Governor, and the Lieutenant Governor. If you would like to see a
   message from our Governor, you'll find it here. Through the Legislative
   branch, you can contact your legislative representatives, search
   Louisiana laws, monitor bills currently under consideration, find out
   how your representative voted, and watch live House Committee
   broadcasts. The Judiciary provides information on federal, state and
   local courts, including dockets, opinions, and filing fees. You can
   also access the Clerks of Court and various legal resources from this
   page.

   In Louisiana, we believe that government should be responsive and
   helpful to make the lives of citizens better. Government services and
   publications and data are now more efficient and more easily available.
   If you still can't find what you need, try our FAQ page.

   Check back often, as we continue to expand our use of technology to
   ensure the future growth of our state and make the lives of our
   citizens easier.
