INTERNATIONAL

   Efforts to respond to scientific misconduct and promote the responsible
   conduct of research are being made by several countries around the
   world. Websites have been developed by organizations in some countries
   to address these subjects. Activities supporting these topics include
   the development of policies for handling misconduct allegations and
   standards of good practice as well as the convening of conferences to
   discuss issues and stimulate action. Some cases have been reported in
   the media and journal articles.  The articles in the Activities and
   Misconduct Cases sections are reprinted from the ORI Newsletter.
