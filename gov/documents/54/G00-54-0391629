        Borehole Temperature Logs from Arctic Alaska, pre-1989
                This dataset consists of borehole temperature measurements
                acquired in permafrost regions of arctic Alaska between
                1950 and 1988 by the U.S. Geological Survey. A large
                number of the 87 sites (boreholes) represented in this
                dataset are deep enough to penetrate the base of
                permafrost.

        Hydroclimatological Data From Three Benchmark Glaciers
                The USGS makes measurements of the net, winter, and summer
                mass balance on three "benchmark" glaciers, South Cascade
                Glacier in Washington State, and Gulkana and Wolverine
                Glaciers in Alaska. Daily measurements are also made at
                each glacier of air temperature and precipitation.

  Streamflow Data for Hydroclimatology

        USGS Water-Resources Investigations Report 93-4076
                Hydroclimatic data network (HCDN): Streamflow data set,
                1874-1988 (CD-ROM). The USGS presently measures streamflow
                at about 7000 sites nationwide; data also are available
                for more than 10,000 sites where measurement has been
                discontinued. The HCDN is a subset of about 1600
                high-quality streamflow records at sites where the
                streamflow is not significantly regulated and where the
                records span periods of time long enough to be of use in
                detecting trends or changes in streamflow characteristics.
