   A. Kadamus Subject: Educational Framework for Interscholastic Athletic
   Programs (EFA) The New York State Public High School Athletic
   Association in conjunction with the New York State Athletic
   Administrators Association; the New York State Association of
   Independent Schools; the New York State Association of Health, Physical
   Education, Recreation, and Dance; the New York State Council of
   Administrators; SUNY at Cortland; the New York State Federation of
   Secondary School Athletic Association; and the New York City Public
   School Athletic League have developed an educational framework for
   interscholastic athletics. This initiative began out of a concern for
   the need to identify educational expecta- tions for school-based
   athletics and in response to the SAVE legislation. It specifically
   addresses Learning Standard 2 for health, physical education, and
   family and consumer sci- ences, A Safe and Healthy Environment, which
   calls for students to demonstrate personally and socially responsible
   behavior, to care for and respect themselves and others, to recognize
   threats to the environment, and to demonstrate responsible personal and
   social behavior while engaged in physical activity. The EFA links
   character development with educational goals and addresses the
   characteristics of competence, character, civility, and citizenship.
   The State Education Department supports this document and encourages
   schools to use it as a resource to enrich athletic programs and to help
   students reach the State's learning stan- dards. It provides a
   framework for staff development, parent meetings, and program evalua-
   tion that school administrators can use to improve sportsmanship and
   the overall educational experience of athletics. For further

   Eric Malmberg; Tom Lickona BACKGROUND On behalf of a number of
   concerned educators, Dr. Eric Malmberg, an associate professor at SUNY
   Cortland, raised some interesting issues in a letter to Deputy
   Commissioner James Kadamus of the New York State Education Department
   and Chancellor Carl T. Hayden of the New York State Board of Regents.
   Dr. Malmberg wrote (March 16, 2000): ...I have had a serious concern
   with the "evolution" of sport and the chang- ing values that seem to be
   invading our school-based athletic programs. Our greatest concern here
   is that changing values seem to continually force coach- es and
   administrators into defense modes with a plethora of problems trying to
   "control" unruly parents, unsportsmanlike behaviors, trash-talking,
   steroid/drug use, etc. Unlike curricular academic subjects, athletic
   programs seem to be very vulnerable to forces outside the schools. If
   school-based athletic programs are supposed to be about something edu-
   cational then: 1. What are the common educational objectives? 2. Why
   couldn't a framework of educational objectives be developed? Addressing
   these issues, Chancellor Hayden wrote Bob Goldberg, president of the
   NYSAAA (March 15, 2000): Dr. Eric Malmberg has shared with me, both in
   writing and in the course of a personal visit, his suggestion that it
   may be possible to develop a set of learn- ing standards for
   competitive athletics. As I understand it, these standards might
   represent a curricula framework for athletics. ...I want you to know
   that I find it provocative and worth pursuing, and I would be
   interested to hear from you and your colleagues when this propos- al
   has been sharpened and more fully vetted. I previously made the
   existence of this proposal known to Jim Kadamus and I think you should
   continue to keep him in the loop as this work goes for- ward. James
   Kadamus, Deputy Commissioner for Elementary, Middle, Secondary, and
   Continuing Education, also responded. He wrote (April 27,2000): I am
   writing in response to your letter of March 16, 2000, related to the
   idea of creating an "Educational Framework for Athletics" in schools
   throughout New York. The New York State Education Department supports
   the concept of pursuing the development and implementation of a
   curricular framework that would help to enhance quality athletic
   experiences, in addition to providing com- pleteness to many virtues we
   aspire to in educating children. We look forward to working in concert
   with you and the professional statewide athletic leadership in meeting
   the challenges associated with this unique initiative. Please keep the
   Education Department informed of all future progress. 1 MAJOR NEEDS
   IDENTIFIED The committee cited the need for educational guidelines that
   emphasize character development and, through identification of
   educational goals, effectively address recently enacted SAVE
   legislation. The committee also pointed out the necessity for
   guidelines that are easily and quickly implemented, and that set
   reasonable expectations for school-based athletics. Local school
   districts were assigned the responsibility of developing and carrying
   out specific implementation strategies. GOAL: FOUR GUIDELINE DOCUMENTS
   It was agreed that, if student athletes are expected to represent
   educational institutions, then those insti- tutions should identify
   educational expectations of athletes. Addressing the concerns of Deputy
   Commissioner Kadamus, the committee decided to focus its efforts on
   producing a set of guidelines for administrators and coaches of
   athletic programs. These guidelines could serve as a useful framework
   to help school districts develop, implement, and enhance a quality,
   educationally oriented interscholastic athletic program. After many
   hours of discussion, the committee began the task of creating four
   documents, which together would comprise the Educational Framework for
   Interscholastic Athletic Programs (EFA): * Mission Statement *
   Educational Goals of a Quality Interscholastic Athletic Program *
   Action Steps of a Quality Interscholastic Athletic Program * The Four
   C's of Athletic Excellence: A Programmatic Assessment Tool UNIFYING
   IDEAS AND PERSPECTIVES The following ideas and perspectives informed
   and guided the creation of the four framework documents: Adults are
   major stakeholders in the sport experience. As coaches, parents, and
   officials, they provide structure for sports. An ongoing partnership
   should be maintained among schools, athletic programs, and parents to
   ensure the realization of educational goals in sports. Coaches and
   parents are central to the enterprise and must have the necessary
   knowledge to convey values and goals to student athletes. Consensus is
   necessary but not always easy to achieve. If we cannot reach consensus
   regarding "the right action" on the playing field, our chances of
   promoting positive behaviors and values are significantly diminished.
   Quality coaching is important. * Good coaches can and should be good
   character educators. * Coaches can, through their actions and
   nonactions, have an effect-either positive or negative. * Coaches who
   make a difference are those who guide with principle. * Coaches must be
   effective and efficient in teaching skills and habits. * Coaches must
   evaluate program objectives as well as student athletes' performances
   with compassion, justice, and honesty. 2 Successful coaches possess the
   following core traits: (Boyea, 1994) * Purpose-They have a vision of
   how a quality program can best be achieved. * Skill-They demonstrate
   competence in knowledge, teaching ability, communication, prioritizing,
   goal setting, and orchestrating the overall atmosphere of the program.
   * Empathy/Relationship-They genuinely care about, respect, show concern
   for, and have the ability to motivate their players. * Character
   Habits-They have a solid work ethic, exhibiting responsibility,
   honesty, integrity, and dedication. These habits foster virtue in
   athletes. The quality of sport is improved when competition and
   collaboration are appropriately balanced. The members of a winning team
   in a vigorously contested game should, in an appropriate manner,
   congratulate their opponents for bringing out the best in them. All
   players should be aware that it takes two teams to play the game; that
   is, collaboration and competition go hand in hand. Teammates, opposing
   team members and staff, athletic directors, parents, and other
   spectators are important collaborators in achieving a positive athletic
   experience at all levels of competition. TEACHING CHARACTER THROUGH
   SPORT Strengthening the connection between interscholastic athletics
   and character development was a primary goal of the framework
   committee. To determine how to reach this goal, committee members
   reviewed a large quantity of material from various sources across the
   country. After much discussion, study, and rethinking, they reached
   consensus on a number of principles regarding the teaching of char-
   acter through interscholastic sport. The following ideas significantly
   inform the Educational Framework document: Proper behavior enhances
   both sport and character development. * Character development enhances
   both sport and ethical behavior. * Character development is defined as
   the formation of universally desirable traits such as respect,
   responsibility, courage, moderation/balance, care, compassion,
   trustworthiness, generosity, and humility. * Character in coaching
   provides the basis for athletic programs founded on respect and focused
   on achieving success of all kinds and at all levels. * Most people
   involved in athletics say that character is a significant component of
   athletic programs. * Many heads of school want practical strategies
   that directly address the issue of character in their programs. * Sport
   may not build character but will reveal it. * Regardless of winning or
   losing, a person's character traits remain the same. * The game should
   foster a healthy interaction among well-intentioned human beings and
   provide a balance of competition and cooperation. * If most people
   agree that participation in sports should be a happy, positive
   experience, then why are so many adults involved in athletic programs
   marred by negative behaviors? Many people play a role in the
   development of character. Parents, teachers, peers, coaches, and other
   role models help to form and reinforce desirable character traits. A
   person of good character possesses knowledge and attitudes that are
   consistent with good behavior and beneficial to that person as well as
   others. Attitudes reflect a person's character, views, values, and core
   virtues, which are defined as follows: (Yeager et al, 2001) Character:
   The formation of universally desirable traits such as respect and
   responsibility. A person who has a well-formed character will most
   likely aspire to act in a consistently just and caring manner. Note: It
   is important for a coach to share with student athletes his/her goals
   in regard to character, and in conveying these goals, the coach should
   use easy-to-understand terminology. 3 Views: Beliefs and opinions
   derived from an individual's intellectual standpoint. Views thrive on
   controversy and heated debates, and may or may not be moral/ethical.
   They are not necessarily exhibited in a person's behavior. Values:
   Emotional-laden wants and desires. Values are personal choices related
   to individual thoughts and feelings. A group of people holding similar
   values share a common morality. Values may or may not be moral or
   ethical and may or may not be put into action. A person who has
   unethical values may choose to play by the rules of the game; or on the
   other hand, a person who has ethical values may fail to play by the
   rules of the game. However, having ethical values tends to increase the
   chances of playing by the rules. Core Virtues: Universally desirable
   habits that all people involved in athletic programs should aspire to
   attain. Virtues are commonly accepted positive traits that transcend
   most creeds and cultures. They are habits of mind, heart, and action
   and are always moral and ethical. Developing good character habits
   requires time and effort. Becoming a good sport is a learned behavior
   that is reinforced over time through practice. An individual who has
   developed strong character has formed enduring habits of head, heart,
   and hand. Such a person knows what is right and has continually
   practiced right actions. A person of well-formed character has less
   difficulty in choosing to behave morally and ethically. Knowing,
   valuing, and acting on the good helps to prevent the bad from
   occurring. 4 Appendices * Mission Statement * Educational Goals of a
   Quality Interscholastic Athletic Program * Action Steps of a Quality
   Interscholastic Athletic Program * The Four C's of Athletic Excellence:
   A Programmatic Assessment Tool These four appendices were developed by
   educators and coaches who represent a variety of school-based athletic
   organizations in New York State. They provide useful guidelines to help
   improve the overall effectiveness and educational nature of school
   athletic programs. These documents will help school districts craft
   effective mission statements; identify educational goals in athletic
   programs; identify action steps to develop a quality interscholastic
   athletic program; and assess specific sports teams in regard to
   competence, character, civility, and citizenship. 5 MISSION STATEMENT
   The mission of New York State interscholastic athletic programs is to
   foster the quest for excellence by creating an educational and
   competitive experience within an atmosphere of sportsmanship.
   Successful programs develop individual and team potential by promoting
   high standards of competence, character, civility, and citizenship.
   EDUCATIONAL GOALS OF A QUALITY INTERSCHOLASTIC ATHLETIC PROGRAM
   Competence A student athlete in a quality program is competent in terms
   of: Skill Development Knowledge of the game/Strategies
   Fitness/Conditioning/Healthy behavior Character A student athlete in a
   quality program demonstrates: Responsibility Accountability Dedication
   Trustworthiness/Fair play Self Control Civility A student athlete in a
   quality program demonstrates civility toward others, showing: Respect
   Fairness Caring Citizenship A student athlete in a quality program
   demonstrates citizenship through actions showing evidence of:
   Loyalty/Commitment Teamwork Role Modeling 6 ACTION STEPS OF A QUALITY
   INTERSCHOLASTIC ATHLETIC PROGRAM Consider the following steps when
   developing an interscholastic athletic program. Develop Mission
   Statements. * Involve coaches, students, parents, and school officials
   in the creation of mission statements. * Create mission statements that
   focus on the development of competence, character, civility, and
   citizen- ship. Define Program Values. * Explain program values by
   citing examples of specific student behaviors that reflect these
   values. Communicate Values Thoroughly. * Clearly communicate program
   values, rules, policies, and expectations to all. * Establish clear
   lines of communication among school officials, coaches, students, and
   parents. Ensure Equality. * Provide equal opportunity for male and
   female student athletes. * Provide a variety of sport offerings
   (include individual, team, closed-skill, and open-skill sports).
   Increase Participation Opportunities for All. * Set goals that embrace
   a sport-for-all philosophy. Compete at Equitable Levels. * Compete in
   leagues or associations that are equitable in number of participants,
   size of school, availability of community resources, etc. Identify,
   Teach, and Assess Ways Sport Fulfills Mission Statement. * Sport should
   enhance development of competence, character, civility, and
   citizenship. Create Positive Learning Environments. Nurture Coaches
   Through Sustained Staff Development. Evaluate Program Effectiveness via
   Mission Statement Criteria. 7 8 THE FOUR C'S OF ATHLETIC EXCELLENCE: A
   PROGRAMMATIC ASSESSMENT TOOL Assumptions: * This assessment tool frames
   athletic excellence around four educational aims or characteristics
   (the 4 C's): competence, character, civility, and citizenship. * This
   instrument is designed to be used by athletic directors,
   administrators, or coaches to assess the performance of a specific
   sports team. It could also be used in a peer or self-assessment
   context. Note: The New York State SAVE legislation mandates instruction
   in competence, character, civility, and citizenship. Usage: * A
   separate score is computed for each of the four components. The overall
   excellence score is the average of the scores on the four components. *
   For all items, ratings should be based on observed behavior.
   Modifications: * This tool could be modified to assess an individual's
   athletic performance or an entire athletic program. It could also be
   modified for use as a self-assessment by athletes. Team
