                     Cal Grant (A and B) Entitlement Awards

     12/20/2001

     Governor Davis' historic financial aid guarantee resulted in a Cal
     Grant participation increase of 54.6 percent over the previous year.
   Final data made available by the California Student Aid Commission
   shows that 48,425 high school seniors, compared to 31,326 high school
   seniors in 2000, were given Cal Grant A and B awards. Of the total
   amount of awardees, 44,567 students attended public high schools.
   This program experienced an 86 percent average increase in awards going
   to schools with low college going rates.
   Governor Davis signed the first-ever Cal Grant guarantee last year.
   This guaranteed financial assistance covers full fees for enrollment at
   any California public college or university (up to $9,700 a year at a
   private institution). Every recent high school graduate with a B
   average and financial need is eligible.
   Outreach efforts since the landmark legislation was signed have
   targeted schools with traditionally low college going rates and those
   with students showing great financial need. These efforts include
   statewide mailings, regional workshops and a public relations campaign
   to encourage students to apply.
   A coalition of partners including the Governors Office of the
   Secretary for Education, higher education institutions, the California
   Student Aid Commission and the Irvine Foundation will begin a new
   outreach program after the new year to assist students with the
   application process.
   The Cal Grant Guarantee is in line with Governor Davis initiatives to
   make college accessible and affordable for all California students.
   These efforts include:

   -Making high quality education a possibility for students from every
   high school, by promoting the University of Californias plan to admit
   the top four percent of students from every high school to a UC campus

   - Providing access to Advanced Placement courses at schools where
   rigorous courses were previously unavailable.

   -Sharpening the focus on academics at high schools, Governor Davis also
   instituted the Governors Scholars Program to provide $1,000
   scholarships to students at every high school who score in the top 10
   percent of their class or top 5 percent statewide on standardized
   tests.
