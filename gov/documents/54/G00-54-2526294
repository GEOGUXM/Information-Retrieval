                     American Memory Viewer Information
            Viewing and Listening to American Memory Collections

   The majority of American Memory collections can be seen and read
   without special viewers. However, in some collections the Library
   provides sound recordings, films, additional high-resolution images,
   and text with enhanced navigation. Just as you need special equipment
   to play videotapes, cassettes, or CDs at home, you need special viewers
   to see and hear these historical materials.

   For information on what viewers are needed, select a format from the
   list below. For installation on your computer, follow the directions
   found on the viewer homepage. To connect your browser to the viewers,
   on the browser toolbar open Options, General Preferences, Helpers and
   follow the browser's directions.

   NOTE: Additional viewer and format information is available on
   individual American Memory collection home pages and on item pages
   within the collections.

                                    Audio

   Sound recordings in American Memory are offered in three formats,
   RealAudio, MPEG 2, Layer 3 (.mp3) and .wav (WaveForm). These sound
   recording formats require special players. See a list of American
   Memory sound recordings in RealAudio, MP3, and .wav Formats.

   RealAudio
   American Memory sound recordings presented in the RealAudio format
   deliver sound faster, with a minimum of download time. To use
   RealAudio, you must have a 14.4 K-bps (kilobits per second) or faster
   Internet connection for your computer.

   Note: RealAudio upgrades its players for improved performance. If you
   have trouble playing an American Memory sound recording presented in
   RealAudio, try downloading the most recent version of the RealAudio
   player.
   RealAudio Player Suggestion:
     * Windows & Macintosh - RealPlayer

   MPEG 2, Layer 3
   Some American Memory collections offer audio files in the MPEG 2, Layer
   3 (MP3) format. MP3 offers high quality sound that comes close to the
   quality of WaveForm at greatly reduced file size. MP3 files download
   much faster than .wav files. Many popular audio players can play MP3
   files.

   Note: Some audio players that are not specifically designed to play MP3
   files do not display the bibliographic information that resides in the
   ID3 v.2 tag of the .mp3 file.
   MP3 Audio Players Suggestion:
     * Windows & Macintosh - MP3 Software Players

   WaveForm
   American Memory sound recordings are also presented in a higher-quality
   version, known as the .wav (WaveForm) format. Sound recordings
   presented in the .wav format must download completely before they can
   be played. Download time for .wav files is longer than for RealAudio.
   Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 computers come equipped with a player that
   plays .wav files. Later Web browsers (ex. Netscape 3.0) have a built-in
   media player that will also play .wav sound files. For users with
   earlier browsers, search the World Wide Web for free or inexpensive
   players that will play .wav files. WAV Player Suggestion:
     * Windows - c:\windows\mplayer.exe (on your local computer)

   Note: To search for freeware or shareware audio players on the World
   Wide Web, use the search words audio helper applications.

                                    Maps

   No Viewers Required
   You need no special viewers to view maps in the American Memory
   collections. Your Internet browser automatically shows images presented
   in .gif (Graphics Interchange Format) format in which American Memory
   maps are presented. A special technology called MrSID (Multi-Resolution
   Seamless Image Database) by LizardTech allows you to zoom in or out on
   an area of the map that you wish to inspect. Maps are stored in .sid
   format.
   See a list of American Memory map collections requiring no special
   viewers.

   MrSID Viewer Option
   For most American Memory maps, the .sid files are now available to
   download to your computer. You have the option of using a free viewer
   to see .sid format maps that you save to your computer. To use the
   viewer, install it on your machine. The average file size in the .sid
   format is 5 megabytes. Viewer Options:

   MrSID Image Viewer:
     * Windows 95/NT & Macintosh - LizardTech Online Viewer

                                    Video

   All American Memory film collections require special viewers.
   Currently, films are presented in three formats, QuickTime, .mpg
   (Motion Pictures Experts Group or MPEG), and .rm (Real Media). For
   detailed playback information, see Video Viewer - Additional Playback
   Information.

   QuickTime Format
   All American Memory films are displayed in the QuickTime (with Cinepak
   compression) format. This format offers smaller, downloadable files and
   allows films to be viewed on lower-end computer systems. In QuickTime,
   film quality is not as crisp as .mpg format film (see below). On
   lower-end, slower-speed computers, QuickTime will drop video frames.
   The average file size in the QuickTime (Cinepak) format is about five
   megabytes for each minute of motion picture.

   Quicktime 3 (with Sorenson compression), has enhanced image quality and
   higher resolution, and is now available in one collection. The average
   file size in QuickTime 3 (Sorenson) format is about six megabytes for
   each minute of motion picture. QuickTime 3 (Sorenson) requires a
   high-end, high-speed computer (Pentium 90 or PowerMac).
   See a list of American Memory film collections in QuickTime format.
   QuickTime Player Suggestion:

   Quicktime (with Cinepak compression)
     * Windows 3.1 - Quicktime 2.1.2
     * Windows 95 - Media Player
     * Macintosh - QuickTime

   Quicktime 3 (with Sorenson compression)
     * Windows & Macintosh - QuickTime

   MPEG Format
   American Memory's highest-quality film files are presented in the .mpg
   (Motion Picture Experts Group) format. Films presented in .mpg format
   are higher resolution and better quality than the equivalent QuickTime
   versions. To view films in the .mpg format, you should have a high-end,
   high-speed computer (such as a Pentium 90 (or better) with a PCI or AGP
   graphics card and .mpg playback software, or a PowerMac with .mpg
   playback software).

   An MPEG-1 video playback board or hardware-assisted playback may
   increase the playback performance of MPEG movies, but it is not
   necessary for modern computers. The average file size for the .mpg
   format is about nine megabytes for each minute of film.
   See a list of American Memory film collections in MPEG format.
   MPEG Player Suggestions:
     * Windows 3.1, 95 - VMPEG 1.7 Lite
     * Windows 95 - Media Player
     * Additional MPEG recommendations

   Real Media (.rm)
   American Memory film collections will add this format, one collection
   at a time. Real Media allows viewing of the film as it arrives at the
   user's computer, eliminating the need to download the film completely
   before viewing. Real Media format is especially useful for computers
   with slower Internet connections, such as a 28.8 modem. Video playback
   is slower (3-6 frames per second) and may be affected by Internet
   traffic.
   See a list of American Memory film collections in Real Media format.
   Real Media Player Suggestions:
     * Windows 3.1, 95 - Real Media Player

   Note: To search for freeware or shareware video players on the World
   Wide Web, use the search words video helper applications.
