   Question:
   How do I determine the interest rate that may be added to a federal
   judgment??

   Answer:
   Effective December 21, 2000, the rate of interest that may be added to
   a judgment, subject to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. ยง3612, 28 U.S.C.
   ยง1961, and 40 U.S.C. ยง258(e)(1), shall be equal to the weekly average
   1-year constant maturity Treasury yield. To obtain the most recent
   rate, the Federal Reserve provides a table of Selected Interest Rates.
   The applicable rate may be found by scrolling down to the section
   entitled: "US government securities - Treasury constant maturities -
   1-year." The most recent rate is found under the column headed "Week
   Ending ____." Earlier rates may be found in the table at the following
   site: http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/H15/data/wf/tcm1y.txt.
