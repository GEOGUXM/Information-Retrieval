    The IHS Pharmacy Practice Training Program: A Certificate Program in
                          Patient Oriented Practice

   This is a four day course designed to improve pharmacists' ability to
   deliver direct patient care in the Indian Health Service and tribal and
   urban program settings.

   This activity is designed to improve pharmacists' patient care skills
   such as chart screening, communication, conflict resolution, patient
   education and consultation, and interviewing. Sessions are included in
   the physical assessment of selected diseases. A prerequisite of the
   program is a basic understanding of IHS pharmacy practice. Participants
   gain an understanding of the philosophy of Indian health program
   pharmacy practice, familiarity with IHS standards of practice, an
   increased sensitivity to cultural issues unique to the Indian health
   programs, and increased knowledge in selected areas of clinical
   pharmacy. The seminar is taught by experienced, practicing IHS
   pharmacists who are role models in this type of practice.

   Participants are asked to review the therapeutic management of several
   of the most common disease states seen in American Indians and Alaska
   Natives. There is a focus on assessment of patients who present to the
   pharmacy with minor problems or requests for chronic medication
   refills. The teaching relies upon a case study format, which includes
   role playing and practice. The cases used are designed to simulate real
   situations seen in Indian health care facilities.

   Direct outpatient care accounts for most of the Indian health program
   pharmacists' duties. Often, a pharmacist uses written protocols,
   approved by the medical staff, to give him or her prescriptive
   authority for selected acute and chronic conditions. The PPTP training
   examines how these protocols can expand the duties of pharmacists in
   the delivery of ambulatory pharmaceutical care.

   The Pharmacy Practice Training Program is open to IHS, urban, and
   tribally employed pharmacists. The pharmacist or his or her service
   unit must pay the travel and per diem expenses for the training, but no
   tuition is charged for IHS, urban, or tribal employees (except when the
   tribal employee works for a tribe that has taken their tribal share of
   the CSC budget; tribes that have taken shares through Title 1 or 3 of
   P.L. 93-638 will need to negotiate a return of funds to CSC to cover
   tuition). Pharmacists are encouraged to attend every two to three years
   to refresh and enhance their skills.

   The IHS Pharmacy Practice Training Program is recognized by pharmacists
   throughout Indian health programs, and indeed, the nation, as a unique
   and valuable training program intended to maintain the high standards
   of care given to our patients.

   On-line Registration is now closed.  The sessions are currently full.
