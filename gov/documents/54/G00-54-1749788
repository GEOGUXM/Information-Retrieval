                                   Contracting

   The USDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region, manages 20 million
   acres of public land in the State of California, and assists the State
   and Private landowners in California, Hawaii, and the U.S. affiliated
   Pacific Islands. To accomplish this mission, Forest Service offices
   throughout California annually purchase goods and services. While all
   national forest locations in California have a contracting contact,
   potential bidders need to contact lead contracting officers at their
   respective Province locations. For administrative purposes, Provinces
   are made up of 3-4 forests.

   The USDA Forest Service purchases a wide variety of goods and services.
   Examples include reforestation services such as tree planting and
   thinning, janitorial, equipment with operator, professional services,
   numerous supplies and construction of roads and facilities.

   USDA Forest Service procurements are guided by the Federal Acquisition
   Regulation as modified by various Department of Agriculture and Forest
   Service policies. These rules and regulations may differ from Uniform
   Commercial Code. USDA Forest Service procurements are generally
   set-aside for small business and may be subject to specific preference
   requirements.
