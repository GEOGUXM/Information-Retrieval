   Kirtland AFB Vehicle Gate Pass

   Kirtland Air Force Base (Albuquerque) requires that the driver of a
   privately-owned or rental vehicle must have a decal on the vehicle or
   be in possession of a valid vehicle gate pass (Form AF75) to enter the
   base. For those individuals who would like to obtain a vehicle gate
   pass prior to going to Kirtland AFB, the Badge Office, following the
   requirements set by Kirtland AFB, can issue passes to LANL
   badgeholders. DOE's Office of Los Alamos Site Operations (formerly Los
   Alamos Area Office) can issue passes to its employees. Consult the
   detailed information on what documents you must have, valid period of
   the pass, etc., prior to coming to the Badge Office, OLASO, or Kirtland
   AFB.
   NOTE: Government vehicles do not require a vehicle gate pass.

   Security Training Room

   The Badge Office makes available as a courtesy a small room containing
   two workstations which badgeholders may use to take the online annual
   security refresher.or check their badge status. You must complete your
   online security training by the Badge Office's service closing time
   (Monday, Wednesday Thursday - 4:30 p.m.; Tuesday, Friday - 3:30 p.m.)
   You should allow 1 - 1.5 hours to complete the training. PLEASE NOTE:
   Occasionally the room must be reserved for some other important
   activity - for the reserved period this room will NOT be available to
   those needing to take the online training or check their status at the
   Badge Office.

   Storing Badges

   [arrow-y-up.gif] The Badge Office will store DOE Standard badges for
   those going on "casual" status. It also can store LANL site-specific
   badges (Official Visitor, Uncleared Foreign National) for those who
   come to the Laboratory on an intermittent basis during the period for
   which their badge is valid. Under no circumstances should a badgeholder
   leave his or her badge with a Group Office for storage. A badge that
   cannot be accounted for will result in denial of badging services.

   The Badge Office will NOT accept nor store any other paraphernalia
   (e.g., dosimetry badge, keys, SmartCard) worn along with the badge --
   each individual is responsible for retaining such items or returning
   them to the appropriate organization. Any items other than the actual
   badge that are left with the Badge Office will be destroyed.

   Badge Office Conference Room

   [arrow-y-up.gif] The Badge Office Conference Room is available for open
   meetings by Laboratory organizations. The Conference Room must be
   reserved in advance. Occupancy capacity is 20 people, seated or
   standing. All users of the Conference Room are expected to follow the
   Guidelines for maintaining this room. First priority for use of the
   Conference Room is the Badge Office Team and other S-6 teams. To check
   the schedule and reserve the Conference Room, send e-mail to
   badge@lanl.gov or call 667-6901.

   Tag Your Bag

   [arrow-y-up.gif] The Badge Office creates tags for employees' tote
   bags, briefcases, backpacks, purses and similar items on a walk-in
   basis only. Employees must bring business cards (three maximum) with
   them in order for the Badge Office to create the tags. If employees do
   not have business cards, they must get their tags through Emergency
   Management and Response Group (S-8) by sending e-mail to either
   emr@headcrash.lanl.gov or emrweb@lanl.gov. Neither the Badge Office nor
   S-8 will hand out the actual materials needed for employees to make the
   tags themselves. Consult S-8's Tag Your Bag page to find out more about
   why this program is so important.

   Alternatively, employees may obtain tags by sending their business
   cards (three maximum) to S-8 by interoffice mail at Mail Stop K496.

   Lost and Found

   [arrow-y-up.gif] The Badge Office functions as a de facto Lost and
   Found service for the Laboratory. If you have lost an item, contact us
   at badge@lanl.gov or 667-6901. You will need to claim lost items that
   have been found and sent to the Badge Office by coming in to the Office
   and showing your badge or other valid photo ID.

   Badge Posters

   [arrow-y-up.gif] The The Badge Office can provide, at no cost, a
   limited number of badge posters, displaying every type of badge issued
   at LANL. These posters are on heavy, semi-glossy stock, in full color,
   and come in two sizes, 11x17 inches and 17x22 inches. They are intended
   for placement in Laboratory buildings to assist workers in recognizing
   the different kinds of badges. They show both the DOE Standard badge
   and the various types of site-specific badges valid for use only at
   LANL. The poster can also be viewed on the Web, and in electronic form
   has hyperlinks from each badge image to information about the
   particular badge. Supplies of the hard copy poster are limited, so
   please only request a few. Posters can be picked up in person at the
   Badge Office. For inquiries contact the Badge Office at badge@lanl.gov
   or 667-1332.
