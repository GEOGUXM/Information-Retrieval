                            Deputy Commissioners

   Approximately 60 Deputy Commissioners are employed by the Board. Deputy
   Commissioners are civil service appointments, unlike Commissioners, who
   are appointed by the Governor. Most have years of experience working in
   corrections and/or law enforcement. Deputy Commissioners primarily
   preside over quasi-judicial parole revocation and parole extension
   hearings to determine whether the parolee has violated his/her parole
   conditions, and if so, to make a determination whether to send the
   parolee back to prison.
   Deputy Commissioners also conduct documentation hearings and multi-year
   denial review for life prisoners; review and decide administrative
   appeals of Board decisions; conduct certification, placement,
   discharge, and re-hospitalization hearings for mentally disordered
   offenders; conduct probable cause hearings for inmates who have been
   determined, via criminal history review and psychiatric evaluations, to
   meet sexually violent predator criteria; and perform other
   decision-making functions relating to prisoners and parolees. Deputy
   Commissioners may also serve as a panel member on lifer parole hearing
   panels with two Commissioners.
