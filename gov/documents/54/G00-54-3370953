   2001 Aqua Fair Attracts 1800 Students

   The 2001 6th statewide Aqua Fair (a USDA Honor Award recipient), held
   at Sardis Lake in Panola County, October 24 & 25, 2001 attracted more
   than 1800 students from twenty-three schools in northeast Mississippi
   and the Mississippi Delta.

   "Aqua Fair 2001" was made possible through a grant from the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency's Nonpoint Program to the Mississippi
   Department of Environmental Quality. The event was accomplished through
   the efforts of 30 different agencies, organizations and corporate
   sponsors.

   NRCS employees, Earth Team volunteers and soil and water conservation
   district employees each played a major role in the success of the
   two-day event by serving as resource presenters and in many other
   capacities. NRCS is a lead agency along with the Mississippi Department
   of Environmental Quality and this year, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
   Sardis Lake. The 2002 Aqua Fair is tentatively scheduled to be held
   next fall in Natchez.
