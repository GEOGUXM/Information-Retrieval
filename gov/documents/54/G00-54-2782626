   Tropical Storm Barry made landfall on the western Florida panhandle
   early this morning and is now well inland.  Barry is forecast to slow
   and turn more to the northwest later today, moving across southern
   Alabama, northern Mississippi and eastern Arkansas over the next 3
   days.  The storm should weaken, but slow forward speed across
   Mississippi and Arkansas is expected to produce very heavy rain and
   serious inland flooding across the lower Mississippi Valley throughout
   the week.

   A tropical storm warning remains in effect from Apalachicola to Ft.
   Walton Beach Florida.  These warnings are expected to be lowered later
   today.

   Heavy rainfall of 6 to 8 inches, with isolated higher amounts, is
   possible over portions of northern Florida, the Florida panhandle,
   Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi later today and tonight.

   Isolated tornadoes are also possible today over portions of northern
   Florida, the Florida panhandle, southern Georgia and southern Alabama.
