   The Atmospheric Chemistry Program (ACP) is a Global Change Research
   program sponsored by the Environmental Sciences Division of the U.S.
   Department of Energy (DOE)

   The overall objective of the ACP is to provide DOE with advanced
   information on the atmospheric environment that is required for
   long-range energy planning. The research is carried out primarily at
   four DOE laboratories and approximately twelve universities and non-DOE
   labs. The thrusts of this research are on regional and continental
   chemistry and fate of tropospheric air pollutants, extracontinental and
   global chemistry and fate of tropospheric air pollutants, and aerosol
   genesis. Laboratory studies emphasize rate and equilibrium processes.
   Field studies are conducted with aircraft and surface measurements on
   reaction chemistry, advective influences on the chemical composition of
   chemistry, and air-surface exchange processes. Modeling efforts address
   both chemistry and dynamics on regional and global scales.
