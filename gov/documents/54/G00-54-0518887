   IRS.gov Accessibility

      The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is committed to making every one of
      the hundreds of thousands of pages, documents, and files on IRS.gov,
      its World Wide Web site, accessible to the widest possible audience.
      The navigation and layout have been improved using recommended
      guidelines outlined in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments
      of 1998. As new content is added, we will continually be working to
      refresh and improve the site to increase its accessibility.

      What is Accessibility? Information on the Web needs to be accessible to
      those with functional impairments in accordance with 508 requirements.
      Accessibility refers to ensuring that access to information is
      available to the widest possible audience. The design of a web site
      determines its accessibility.
        * Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended in 1998, is a
          Federal mandate that requires that information technology be
          accessible to people with disabilities.

        * It requires that Federal agencies’ electronic and information
          technology (EIT) developed, procured, maintained, or used by the
          Federal government be accessible to people with disabilities,
          including employees and members of the public.

      Using the site:

      Most visitors will be able to view the IRS Web site using the most
      popular browsers. The accessibility features that have been put in
      place thus far are just the beginning. The IRS, in an effort to serve
      the needs of all who visit our web site, will continue over the next
      several months to make content accessible for persons using special
      assistive technology.
        * Text Descriptions Provided for Images and Pictures - When the mouse
          pointer or pointer alternative moves over an image, a small window
          pops up to give you a description of the image. This description is
          also provided to visitors who are using screen readers to access
          information on the page.

        * Style Sheets Used to Format Page Content on this site are designed
          using cascading style sheets. This allows visitors to disable the
          formatting provided and apply their own formatting if they choose.
          Style sheets are disabled within an Internet browser's settings or
          preferences options. People with a slight visual impairment who
          need a larger font size to read comfortably will find this feature
          useful.

        * Persons using screen-reading devices, who generally cannot directly
          read documents in PDF format, will find a HTML version of many of
          the forms and the publications on the IRS site. Over the next
          several months, the IRS plans to make all PDF files accessible. As
          new publications become available in Acrobat 5.0, which is 508
          compliant, they will be posted on the site.

        * Direct Links to Main Sections of Each Page are provided for those
          using Screen Readers - Screen readers tend to read pages from left
          to right and from top to bottom. The pages in IRS.gov provide
          internal bookmarks so that screen reader users can jump directly to
          specific sections of the page. This feature is referred to as a
          navigation menu bypass.

      For information on Forms and Publications Accessibility:

      The IRS Alternative Media Center has prepared hundreds of its most
      popular tax forms, instructions, and tax publications using full text
      descriptions where needed and is making these files available for
      download through the IRS web site. Adobe Acrobat PDF format has been
      used as a means of distributing government forms as well as other
      documents.
