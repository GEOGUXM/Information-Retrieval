   Report to the Secretary of Energy and the Congress.
   April 2001

     In this report, the Board summarizes its major activities in
     calendar year 2000. During 2000, the Board identified four priority
     areas for evaluating the potential repository at Yucca Mountain. The
     areas are the following:
     * meaningful quantification of conservatisms and uncertainties in the
       DOE's performance assessments
     * progress in understanding the underlying fundamental processes
       involved in predicting the rate of waste package corrosion
     * an evaluation and a comparison of the base-case repository design
       with a low-temperature design
     * development of multiple lines of evidence to support the safety
       case of the proposed repository, the lines of evidence being
       derived independently of performance assessment and thus not being
       subject to the limitations of performance assessment.

     The report summarizes the Board's views on each priority area. A
     more detailed discussion of the priorities can be found in letters
     to the DOE included among the appendices to the report.

   Report to the U.S. Congress and the Secretary of Energy.
   April 2000.

     In this report, the Board summarizes its major activities in
     calendar year 1999. Among the activities discussed in the report is
     the Boards 1999 review of the DOEs viability assessment (VA) of
     the Yucca Mountain site. The Boards evaluation of the VA concludes
     that Yucca Mountain continues to warrant study as the candidate site
     for a permanent geologic repository and that work should proceed to
     support a decision on whether to recommend the site for repository
     development. The Board suggests that the 2001 date for a decision is
     very ambitious, and focused study should continue on natural and
     engineered barriers. The Board states that a credible technical
     basis does not currently exist for the above-boiling repository
     design included in the VA. The Board recommends evaluation of
     alternative repository designs, including lower-temperature designs,
     as a potential way to help reduce the significance of uncertainties
     related to predictions of repository performance.

   Report to the U.S. Congress and the Secretary of Energy.
   April 1999.

     In this report, the Board summarizes its major activities during
     calendar year 1998. The report discusses the research needs
     identified in the DOEs recently issued Viability Assessment of the
     Yucca Mountain site, including plans to gather information on the
     amount of water that will eventually seep into repository drifts,
     whether formations under the repository will retard the migration of
     radionuclides, the flow-and-transport properties of the groundwater
     that lies approximately 200 meters beneath the repository horizon,
     and long-term corrosion rates of materials that may be used for the
     waste packages. The report describes other activities undertaken by
     the Board in 1998, including a review of the hypothesis that there
     were hydrothermal upwellings at Yucca Mountain, a workshop held to
     increase understanding of the range of expert opinion on waste
     package materials, and a review of the DOEs draft environmental
     impact statement for the Yucca Mountain site.

   Report to the U.S. Congress and the Secretary of Energy: Moving Beyond
   the Viability Assessment.
   April 1999.

     In its report, the Board offers its views on the DOEs December 1998
     Viability-Assessment of the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada. The Yucca
     Mountain site is being characterized to determine its suitability as
     the location of a permanent repository for disposing of spent
     nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The Board discusses
     the need to address key uncertainties that remain about the site,
     including the performance of the engineered and natural barriers.
     The Board addresses the DOEs plans for reducing those uncertainties
     and suggests that consideration be given to alternative repository
     designs, including ventilated low-temperature designs that have the
     potential to reduce uncertainties and simplify the analytical bases
     for determining site suitably and for licensing. The Board also
     comments on the DOEs total system performance assessment, the
     analytical tool that pulls together information on the performance
     of the repository system.

   Report to the U.S. Congress and The Secretary of Energy.
   November 1998.

     In its report, the Board offers its views on the direction of future
     scientific and technical research under way and planned by the DOE
     as part of its program for characterizing a site at Yucca Mountain,
     Nevada, as a potential repository for spent fuel and high-level
     radioactive waste. The Board discusses some of the remaining key
     scientific and technical uncertainties related to performance of a
     potential repository. The Boards report addresses some of these
     uncertainties by examining information about the proposed repository
     system presented to it in meetings and other technical exchanges.
     The Board considers and comments on some of the important
     connections between the sites natural properties and the current
     designs for the waste package and other engineered features of the
     repository.

   1997 Findings and Recommendations.
   April 1998.

     This report details the Boards activities in 1997 and covers, among
     other things, the DOEs viability assessment, due later this year;
     underground exploration of the candidate repository site at Yucca
     Mountain, Nevada; thermal testing underway at the site; what happens
     when radioactive waste reaches the water table beneath Yucca
     Mountain; transportation of spent fuel; and the use of expert
     judgment. The Board makes four recommendations in the report
     concerning (1) the need for the DOE to begin now to develop
     alternative design concepts for a repository, (2) the need for the
     DOE to include estimates of the likely variation in doses for
     alternative candidate critical groups in its interim performance
     measure for Yucca Mountain, (3) the need for the DOE to evaluate
     whether site-specific biosphere data is needed for license
     application, and (4) the need for the DOE to make full and effective
     use of formally elicited expert judgment.

     This publication was developed from remarks made by Dr. John
     Cantlon, Chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, at
     Topseal 96, an international conference on nuclear waste management
     and disposal. The meeting was sponsored by the Swedish Nuclear Fuel
     and Waste Management Company (SKB) and the European Nuclear Society.
     The publication highlights the Boards views on the status of the
     U.S. program for management and disposal of commercial spent nuclear
     fuel and provides a brief overview of the programs organization. It
     summarizes the DOEs efforts to characterize the Yucca Mountain site
     and to develop a waste isolation strategy for the site. The
     publication also outlines legislative and regulatory changes under
     consideration at that time and the Boards views on the technical
     implications of those possible changes.

   Disposal and Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel - Finding the Right Balance.
   March 1996.

     This special report caps more than two years of study and analysis
     by the Board into the issues surrounding the need for interim
     storage of commercial spent nuclear fuel and the advisability and
     timing of the development of a federal centralized storage facility.
     The Board concludes in the report that the DOEs efforts should
     remain focused on permanent geologic disposal and the site
     investigations at Yucca Mountain, Nevada; that planning for a
     federal centralized spent fuel storage facility and the required
     transportation infrastructure be begun now, but actual construction
     delayed until after a site-suitability decision is made about the
     Yucca Mountain site; that storage should be developed incrementally;
     that limited, emergency backup storage capacity be authorized at an
     existing nuclear facility; and that, if the Yucca Mountain site
     proves unacceptable for repository development, other potential
     sites for both centralized storage and disposal be considered.

   Letter Report to Congress and the Secretary of Energy.
   February 1994.

     This report is issued in letter format due to impending legislative
     hearings on the DOEs fiscal year 1995 budget and new funding
     mechanisms sought by the Secretary of Energy. The 8-page report
     (ninth in the NWTRB series) restates a recommendation made in the
     Boards Special Report, that an independent review of the OCRWMs
     management and organizational structure be initiated as soon as
     possible. Also, it adds two additional recommendations: ensure
     sufficient and reliable funding for site characterization and
     performance assessment, whether the program budget remains level or
     is increased, and build on the Secretary of Energys new public
     involvement initiative by expanding current efforts to integrate the
     views of the various stakeholders during the decision-making
     process-not afterward.

   Underground Exploration and Testing at Yucca Mountain A Report to
   Congress and the Secretary of Energy.
   October 1993.

     This report (eighth in the NWTRB series) focuses on the exploratory
     studies facility at Yucca Mountain, Nevada: the conceptual design,
     planned exploration and testing, and excavation plans and schedules.
     In addition to a number of detailed recommendations, the Board makes
     three general recommendations. First, the DOE should develop a
     comprehensive strategy that integrates exploration and testing
     priorities with the design and excavation approach for the
     exploratory facility. Second, underground thermal testing should be
     resumed as soon as possible. Third, the DOE should establish a
     geoengineering board with expertise in the engineering,
     construction, and management of large underground projects.

   Special Report to Congress and the Secretary of Energy.
   March 1993.

     The Boards seventh report provides a nontechnical approach for those
     not familiar with the details of the DOEs high-level nuclear waste
     management program. It highlights three important policy issues: the
     program is driven by unrealistic deadlines, there is no integrated
     waste management plan, and program management needs improvement. The
     Board makes three specific recommendations: amend the current
     schedule to include realistic intermediate milestones; develop a
     comprehensive, well-integrated plan for the overall management of
     all spent nuclear fuel and high-level defense waste from generation
     to disposal; and implement an independent evaluation of the Office
     of Civilian Radioactive Waste Managements (OCRWM) organization and
     management. These recommendations should be implemented without
     slowing the progress of site-characterization activities at Yucca
     Mountain.

     congressional testimony, changes in Board makeup, and the Little
     Skull Mountain earthquake. Chapter 2 details panel activities and
     offers seven technical recommendations on the dangers of a
     schedule-driven program; the need for top-level systems studies; the
     impact of defense high-level waste; the use of high capacity,
     self-shielded waste package designs; and the need for prioritization
     among the numerous studies included in the site-characterization
     plans. In Chapter 3, the Board offers candid insights to the
     high-level waste management program in five countries, specifically
     those areas that might be applicable to the U.S. program, including
     program size and cost, utility responsibilities, repository
     construction schedules, and alternative approaches to licensing.
