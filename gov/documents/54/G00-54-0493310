TREASURY SECURITIES AT A GLANCE
     __________________________________________________________________


Introduction

   This document describes marketable and nonmarketable securities that
   the Treasury issues currently and unmatured securities that we issued
   in the past, but have withdrawn from current sale. The information
   covers the statutory authority, governing regulations, and the features
   of each type of security.

   The full faith and credit of the United States guarantees the timely
   payment of principal and interest on Treasury securities. The Treasury
   sells marketable bills, fixed-principal notes and bonds, and
   inflation-indexed notes and bonds in regularly scheduled auctions.
   Bills, fixed-principal notes and bonds, and inflation-indexed notes and
   bonds are freely transferable. They are traded in the highly
   competitive global capital markets. They are available in book-entry
   form in the commercial book-entry system through a financial
   intermediary. They also may be held in book-entry form in
   TreasuryDirect.

   Treasury securities generally are not callable prior to maturity. The
   exception is that prior to 1985, the Treasury issued marketable,
   callable long-term bonds, and many of them remain outstanding. The
   Treasury can redeem those callable bonds on their first call date,
   which is five years prior to the maturity date, or on any semiannual
   interest payment date thereafter. The Treasury must provide four
   months' notice before calling a bond. In fact, we have called a number
   of bonds during their call periods.

   Until late 1998, the method for selling marketable Treasury securities
   generally had been multiple-price auctions. In a multiple-price
   auction, we accepted the yields (discount rates in the case of Treasury
   bills) that were bid competitively from the lowest to the highest yield
   required to sell the amount offered to the public. Competitive bidders
   whose tenders were accepted paid the price equivalent to the yield (or
   discount rate) that they bid. Noncompetitive bidders paid the
   weighted-average price of accepted competitive bids.

   We started to conduct single-price auctions on an experimental basis
   for monthly sales of 2- and 5-year notes in September 1992 and extended
   the use of single-price auctions to all marketable Treasury securities
   in November 1998. All auctions of inflation-indexed notes and bonds
   have been on a single-price basis since we began selling
   inflation-indexed securities in January 1997. As with multiple-price
   auctions, single-price auctions are conducted in terms of yield (bank
   discount rate in the case of Treasury bills). Bids are accepted from
   the lowest yield (or discount rate) to the highest required to sell the
   amount offered. In contrast to multiple-price auctions, all awards are
   at the highest yield (or discount rate) of accepted bids.

   We have found that single-price auctions have advantages for the
   Treasury. First, they tend to distribute auction awards to a greater
   number of bidders than under the multiple-price auction. Second,
   auction participants may bid more aggressively in single-price
   auctions. Successful bidders are able to avoid the so-called "winner's
   curse," the risk that a bidder will pay more than others buying
   securities in an auction. We estimate that more aggressive bidding has
   lowered Treasury borrowing costs somewhat. You can obtain the Treasury
   studies of single-price auctions on http://www.treas.gov/domfin/.

   The Treasury also sells nonmarketable securities to the public in the
   form of U.S. Savings Bonds, State and local government series
   securities, foreign-series securities, domestic-series securities, and
   mortgage guaranty insurance company tax and loss bonds. Nonmarketable
   securities that the Treasury issues to the public are not transferable,
   and they can be purchased and redeemed, through a Federal Reserve Bank,
   or in the case of U.S. Savings Bonds, through issuing and paying agents
   (mostly commercial banks and thrifts).

   Generally, interest income on Treasury securities is reportable for
   Federal income tax purposes but is not reportable for State or local
   income tax purposes. This document contains information on the income
   tax treatment of securities, including U.S. Savings Bonds and
   inflation-indexed securities, where there may be special Federal income
   tax considerations.

   The Treasury does not provide investment or tax advice. You may want to
   consult with a financial professional before you decide to purchase a
   particular Treasury security.
