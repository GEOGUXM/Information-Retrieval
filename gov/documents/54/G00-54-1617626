   For Immediate Release: March 26, 1997 2:32 P.M. EST

                          Remarks by The President
             during Health Care Quality Commission Announcement

                                The East Room

   The President: Thank you very much. Thank you, Secretary Shalala,
   Acting Secretary Metzler. Thank you both for the work you've done on
   this. I thank the commission members for their willingness to serve --
   those who are here and a few who could not be here with us today. And I
   thank all of you here in this audience for your interest in this
   profoundly important matter.

   The Advisory Commission that I announced today will help to chart our
   way through a time of profound change in health care. Their task will
   be focused and urgent: to find ways to ensure quality and to ensure
   that the rights of consumers in health care are protected.

   Since I took office, we have been committed to improving our health
   care system -- to making it more affordable, more accessible, while
   preserving its high quality. You have heard Secretary Shalala mention
   some of the things we have done together. We've worked with states to
   expand Medicaid to more than 2 million Americans who previously had no
   insurance. We reached across party lines to enact the Kassebaum-Kennedy
   law that provides that working families will not lose their insurance
   when they change jobs. We increased the health care tax deduction for 3
   million self-employed Americans. And now in our budget plan, we have
   funds sufficiently targeted to extend coverage to as many as half of
   our 10 million American children who still don't have medical coverage.

   We've worked to constrain costs. Just yesterday I announced a new
   effort to combat the multi-billion dollar problem of fraud and abuse in
   Medicare and Medicaid. Our balanced budget proposal also strengthens
   Medicare through savings and overdue structural reforms.

   Of course, we're not alone in this. The private sector has found ways
   to rein in costs, sometimes dramatically. And in many cases, changes in
   the health care delivery system have, frankly, also improved its
   quality. For example, the growing recognition of the value of
   preventive care, such as mammography screening, is saving and extending
   lives and the quality of life. This is all very encouraging. Step by
   step we have been working to expand access to health care and today we
   take the next step.

   In this time of transition, many Americans worry that lower costs mean
   lower quality and less attention to their rights. On balance, however,
   managed health care plans -- HMOs, PPOs and others -- give patients
   good care and greater choice at lower cost. Still, we must make sure
   that these changes do not keep health professionals from offering the
   best and the most medically appropriate services to their patients.
   Managed care managed well can be the best deal for our families.
   Whether they have traditional health care or managed care, none of our
   people should ever have inferior care.

   I am proud that the Medicare and Medicaid programs have taken the lead
   in responding to the quality concerns of both patients and health care
   providers, as Secretary Shalala has just described. But we're learning
   the defining, measuring and enforcing quality is far from a simple
   task. There are many complicated issues; they require thoughtful study.
   And, not surprisingly, there are many areas where broad-based consensus
   on how best to proceed does not yet exist.

   That is why I decided late last year to establish the Advisory
   Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the health care
   industry. Today, I am happy to introduce the members of that commission
   to the American people. They are a highly distinguished, broad-based
   and diverse group. They represent consumers, business, labor, health
   care providers, insurers, managed care plans, state and local
   governments, health care quality experts. Their specialties are
   wide-ranging, including care for children, the elderly, women, people
   with disabilities, mental illness or AIDS. This commission includes
   some of the best health care policy minds in our nation, and a lot of
   people with hands-on experience. Its task will be as challenging as it
   is critical.

   Today, to assure that they get busy right away, I am charging the
   commission to develop a consumer bill of rights so that health care
   patients get the information and care they need when they need it.
   Let's assure that patients and their families first, that the health
   care professionals who are treating them are free to provide the best
   medical advice available. Second, that their providers are not subject
   to inappropriate financial incentives to limit care. Third, that our
   sickest and most vulnerable patients, frequently the elderly and people
   with disabilities, are receiving the best medical care for their unique
   needs. Fourth, that consumers have access to simple and fair procedures
   for resolving health care coverage disputes with plans.

   Fifth, and perhaps most important, that consumers have basic
   information about their rights and responsibilities, about the plans --
   the benefits the plans offer, about how to access the health care they
   need, and about the quality of their providers and their health care
   plans.

   I'm delighted that the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the
   Secretary of Labor will take on the task of being the commission's
   co-chairs. I look forward to reviewing their first report at the end of
   the year and their final report next March.

   The need for this commission is real. It is urgent. It will give us a
   road map to help us make our way through the time of rapid change we
   now see in our health care system. There are few people in the nation
   better suited to the task than the members of this commission. And
   again, let me say, I want to thank them for their commitment to serve.
   And to all the rest of you, let me say one of the things -- one of the
   many things I have learned in the last four years as President -- is
   that a distinguished commission broadly based with a clear mandate can
   make a profound positive difference for our country.

   In the health care related areas, I ask you to think of only two. Think
   of the work done by the Gulf War Commission and what we now know that
   we did not know then they started to meet and work. Think of the
   remarkable work done by the commission that dealt with those who were
   exposed to human radiation experiments just a few decades ago here and
   the work that they have done.

   There is a peculiar way in which the citizens of the United States when
   brought together around a clear mandate interfacing with their
   government and with the private sector can do more than either the
   government or the private sector could do alone.

   And so again, let me say, I'm very hopeful about this commission. I
   look forward to their progress on the consumer's bill of rights. I look
   forward to all the work that they do. And I ask you to join me in
   thanking them for their willingness to serve.

   Thank you very much. (Applause.)
