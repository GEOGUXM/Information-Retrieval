   General Information Concerning OIG Vacancies:

   The Office of Inspector General of the National Science Foundation is
   considering hiring scientific and engineering staff, scientific and
   investigative attorneys, and audit advisors. The NSF OIG investigates
   all allegations of wrongdoing under NSF awards, including allegations
   of criminal and civil fraud and misconduct in science. Applicants with
   a science background would be more involved in investigations of
   misconduct in science, which includes plagiarism and the falsification
   of fabrication of research data. The NSF OIG also oversees the
   expenditure of NSF funds, both within NSF and under NSF awards to
   outside entities.

   Applicants for scientific and engineering staff should have a graduate
   degree in science or engineering (a Ph.D. is highly desirable), should
   be familiar with the research and education communities that NSF
   serves, and should be interested in working to uphold those
   communities' ethical standards. Applicants for the other positions
   should have a law degree and/or a graduate degree or substantial
   experience in criminal justice, forensic science, business
   administration, finance, or a scientific field. The salary for these
   positions will depend on the applicant's training and experience.

   NSF is an independent agency of the federal government, established in
   1950 to promote and advance scientific progress by sponsoring
   scientific and engineering research and education.
