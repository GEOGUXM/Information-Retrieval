      The Next Generation Airborne Observatory

      Astronomical objects emit many forms of energy, which neither the human
      eye nor ordinary telescopes can detect. Infrared is one form of this
      invisible energy. SOFIA is an airborne observatory that will study the
      universe in the infrared spectrum. Besides this contribution to science
      progress, SOFIA will be a major factor in the development of
      observational techniques, of new instrumentations and in the education
      of young scientists and teachers in the discipline of infrared
      astronomy.

      NASA and the DLR, German Aerospace Center, are working together to
      create SOFIA Â— a Boeing 747SP aircraft modified by Raytheon Aircraft
      Integration Services to accommodate a 2.5 meter reflecting telescope.
      SOFIA will be the largest airborne observatory in the world, and will
      make observations that are impossible for even the largest and highest
      of ground-based telescopes. The observatory is being developed and
      operated for NASA by a team of industry experts led by the Universities
      Space Research Association. SOFIA will be based at NASA's Ames Research
      Center at Moffett Federal Airfield near Mountain View, California, and
      is expected to begin flying in the year 2004.

      SOFIA is just one of the space-based observatory missions under NASA's
      Origins Program, which along with the ground-based observatories paves
      the way for future achievements. As each Origins mission makes radical
      advances in technology, innovations will be fed forward, from one
      generation of missions to the next.

   rendering of SOFIA in flight


   Using an aircraft to carry an astronomical telescope above most of the
   Earth's obscuring atmosphere is not a new idea. NASA scientists have
   been flying airborne telescopes for nearly thirty years. But SOFIA will
   be the biggest and the most powerful. With its larger telescope and
   more modern detectors, SOFIA will be many times more sensitive than its
   predecessor, the Kuiper Airborne Observatory, which flew out of Ames
   from 1971 to 1995.

   SOFIA is expected to fly into the stratosphere, open the telescope
   cavity door, and point its telescope at the heavens three or four
   nights a week for at least twenty years.
