         Welcome to the USGS Woods Hole Field Center Ourtreach Page!

   The USGS in Woods Hole is a part of the nation's Coastal and Marine
   Geology Program. As a government agency, part of our mission is to
   provide geologic information that is important to communities around
   the country. At the Woods Hole Field Center, we offer a variety of
   information about coastal and marine issues for the Northeast and other
   regions of the U.S. and the world. This information is useful for the
   public, educators, students, scientists, businesses, and other
   government agencies.
