                            Questions and Answers

   1. What casues the error code 400 that I get on some forms? This is an
   issue with the Netscape Browser associated with Active Server Pages. We
   are working on isolating the code that causes this but the process is
   very slow. In the meantime, you can eliminate the issue by using
   Microsoft Internet Explorer as you browser.
   2. How do I set-up my wing structure related to assigning units into
   groups? This feature is supported under the MIS staff option using the
   Administer the Wing database link, then choosing Web MMU Setup
   Parameters option. You will see an option to Define Wing Unit
   Organizational Structure.
   3. The password creation form will not accept my information. Your
   birthdate is used to validate your identity when you first create a
   password. The value that you enter is compared with the date on file at
   National Headquarters. We have found that about 10% of the dates on
   file are incorrect. If you get this error, check with your unit
   printout or CAPWATCH and check the information on your birthday. If it
   is incorrect, you can use the incorrect value to create your password,
   but you should notify National to make the correction.
   4 When I print a CAPF 101 card, all the specialties show even though
   they are blacked out on the screen. This is an issue with your browser
   settings. Most browsers have a default setting to not print background
   images and colors. You must change this setting. In IE, go to the tools
   and choose Internet Options. Click on the Advanced tab and look for the
   Printing options. Make sure the box is checked.
