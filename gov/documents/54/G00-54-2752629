   [spacer.gif] [vert.gif] [spacer.gif] To email my office a message,
   please go here to use the House of Representatives "Write Your Rep"
   mail system.

   For those of you who have previously emailed my office using "Citizen
   Direct" and are used to that service, I apologize. Unfortunately my
   office had to discontinue that service. I appreciate your patience as
   we move to a more efficient service.

   Because of the tremendous volume of mail we receive each day,
   unfortunately, we cannot accept e-mail which comes from outside the
   22nd District of Texas. I trust you will understand. If you prefer to
   send me regular mail, also known as "snail mail," please do so. My
   contact information in Washington is:
