      OSHA STEEL ERECTION STANDARD TAKES EFFECT

      The nation's iron workers have enhanced workplace safety protections as
      a result of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's new
      steel erection standard, which goes into effect today.

      "This standard focuses on the most dangerous hazards in the industry
      and the hazards posed by evolving work practices and new technologies,"
      said OSHA Administrator John L. Henshaw. "This emphasis will help
      prevent many of the 2,300 unnecessary injuries and 35 fatalities that
      occur in this industry every year."

      This rule is the first OSHA safety standard developed under the
      Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 and the Department of Labor's
      negotiated rulemaking policy. Developed in conjunction with industry
      and union groups, the new rule is expected to save employers nearly $40
      million a year.

      The new standard improves protection to iron workers by placing special
      emphasis on the most serious hazards in the steel erection industry.
      These include hazards associated with working under loads; hoisting,
      landing and placing decking; column stability; double connections;
      landing and placing steel joists, and falls to lower levels.

      Although the new steel erection requirements are now in effect, OSHA
      will not conduct general schedule inspections for 60 days, until March
      19, 2002. During this period, the agency will emphasize outreach and
      education to assist the industry in training employees on the new
      requirements.
