   Most Asked Questions About Bioterrorism and Anthrax
        __________________________________________________________________

      1. Is it possible to get a prescription for antibiotics like
      ciprofloxacin?

      No, it is not good practice to take antibiotics without the need to do
      so. Personal supplies of antibiotics for use in the event of a
      biological attack are not recommended for several reasons. Taking them
      ahead of time does not build any immunity to infection, and may weaken
      your immunity.

      There are a number of different germs a bioterrorist might use to carry
      out an attack. There is no one antibiotic that is effective against all
      diseases. Hoarding antibiotics can lead to shortages of medication
      needed for people with serious infections. There are large supplies of
      medications already stored that can be in our area within hours.

      2. Can I receive an anthrax immunization?

      No, anthrax vaccines are not being recommended for the general public
      and are only made available to active duty military.
      3. Can I receive a smallpox vaccination?

      The smallpox vaccine is not recommended for anyone right now, because
      there is no evidence of an outbreak of smallpox, and the vaccine can
      have serious side effects. Smallpox was eradicated from the world in
      1980 and there have been no infections in people since then. The CDC
      will make the vaccine available if there is an outbreak.

      Many if not most Americans were vaccinated as children, while this
      immunity does not last a lifetime; there is no indication that you need
      a vaccine immediately. Health Care providers are not carrying smallpox
      vaccine now. The only stock of vaccine is at the CDC in Atlanta. CDC
      has contracted with manufacturers to produce more smallpox vaccine.
      people and more vaccine is going to be delivered in 2002.

      4. Is my smallpox immunization still good?

      No. The vaccine is estimated to be good for approximately 10-20 years.
      Everyone is the US is considered susceptible to smallpox now that 30
      years has passed since the last routine vaccinations were given.

      5. I handle a lot of mail and sometimes there is dust that gets on my
      clothes and hands, what do I do?

      There are no documented instances of anthrax in Washington State and
      the risk of anthrax being sent here is thought to be extremely low. It
      is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water any time
      you handle something dirty or dusty since handwashing is a good way to
      avoid all the more common flu and bacterial germs as well. Hand washing
      with regular soap and water is also the recommended way to remove
      anthrax from your skin.

      6. I'm just really worried about all the things I've heard about in the
      news. I'm really worried I have anthrax. I think I've been exposed.

        1. The risk of anthrax is very low. The number of real cases
        identified so far is small compared to the number of people that
        will get sick or die from the flu this year.

        2. Anthrax cannot be transmitted from person to person.

        3. Within our region, public health officials, the police and the
        fire departments have developed bioterrorism surveillance systems.
        They are working with the FBI and the Federal Government on a
        coordinated response. VA has specific roles and responsibilities
        that will be initiated if a threat or event occurs here.

        4. Any substance thought to be possible anthrax can be tested and
        identified.

        5. If there is a threat of anthrax you should call extension 911
        within the medical center, a team is available to evaluate the
        situation and test the substance if necessary.

      7. I have flu-like symptoms should I be evaluated for anthrax or I want
      to be evaluated for anthrax?

      In general, persons with flu-like symptoms need to use the same
      judgment as they always would if you would usually see your doctor for
      your symptoms, you should do so now. If you would not usually see your
      doctor for your symptoms, there is no special reason to do so now.

      If you think you have been exposed, contact a Doctor immediately. The
      only people that need to have special concern about typical flu-like
      syndromes are persons who have a known exposure to anthrax or a
      potential aerosol exposure to a suspicious substance. In these
      circumstances, persons should seek medical evaluation for any flu-like
      illness or skin rash.
