Description of the experiment

   E949 is a rare kaon decay experiment in the C4 beamline (LESB III) at
   the AGS. We are seeking to measure the branching ratio of K+ -> pi nu
   nu. E949 is a successor experiment to the very successful E787
   experiment. E787 was the first experiment to observe this very rare
   decay during the 1995 run at the AGS. More information on E787 can be
   found at the web site, or in the following brief description. E949
   plans to substantially upgrade the photon veto system, the trigger, the
   data acquisition, and several other key detector systems.
