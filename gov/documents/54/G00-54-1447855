   As the Nation's largest natural resource science agency, the USGS
   provides information that is used to protect life and property from
   natural disasters, manage natural resources, and protect the
   environment. The USGS is a science agency; we have no regulatory or
   management function. Our mission, since being established by Congress
   in 1879, is to provide relevant, impartial, and timely natural resource
   information. These web pages are designed to do just that.

   The USGS works in cooperation with more than 2000 organizations across
   the United States. We have at least one office in every state. Our
   cooperative approach to conducting science and our widespread
   distribution help us to do science that is relevant. This also helps us
   in communicating science to managers and regulators so they can make
   sound decisions.

   The USGS has four divisions. The National Mapping Division is best
   known for providing topographic maps used by hikers and others. The
   Geologic Division is best known for assessing the Nation's energy and
   mineral resources and for research and monitoring related to
   earthquakes and volcanoes. The Biological Resources Division is best
   known in Michigan for extensive research and monitoring in the Great
   Lakes. The Great Lakes Science Center, located in Ann Arbor, works
   closely with local, state, federal, and binational agencies to provide
   critical biological information for the Great Lakes. The Water
   Resources Division is best known for it's national streamflow
   monitoring program, extensive mapping of the nation's ground-water
   resources, and a national water-quality monitoring and assessment
   program. The Michigan District, with our main office in Lansing and
   field offices in Grayling and Escanaba, is part of the Water Resources
   Division.
