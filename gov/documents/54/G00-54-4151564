       be requested by customs officials.

     * Companies planning to use privately created certificates of origin
       should obtain Customs approval beforehand.

       US$1000, (2) for goods which do not qualify under the NAFTA
       provisions for the lower tariff rate, or (3) for temporary entry
       goods.

     * Certificate can be submitted for a refund up to 1 year after the
       importation of the good.

     * The U.S. and Canada require that the certificate be kept for 5
       years, Mexico for 10 years.

   Note: This document is meant to be a guide on the Rules of Origin
   provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Exporters should
   keep in mind that only the NAFTA text itself and the customs
   regulations of each country that may be issued to implement NAFTA are
   definitive. For complex issues or where interpretation is required,
   exporters should seek legal assistance or an advanced ruling from the
   Customs Administration in the country to which they are exporting.
