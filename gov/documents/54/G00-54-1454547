   United States Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service

                     Monday, December 6, 1999 9:45 a.m.

                       3810 4th Street Lubbock, Texas

Mission and Purpose

   The Mission of the USDA-ARS Plant Stress and Water Conservation
   Laboratory is to conduct fundamental and applied research on the
   response of plants to stress. The research develops appropriate
   germplasm and management systems to reduce the impact of these stresses
   on crop yields and product quality.

   The laboratory is housed in a 64,000 square foot facility containing
   offices, laboratories, and greenhouse space. The facility is designed
   to foster scientific interaction while allowing flexibility for the
   future. The building will house 20 scientists, plus professional
   technical support personnel, numerous students and assistants, and
   administrative and maintenance staff.

History of the USDA Plant Stress and Water Conservation Laboratory

   The new Plant Stress and Water Conservation Laboratory is the
   culmination of efforts dating from the drought of the 1950's. Planning
   for a Plant Stress and Water Conservation Laboratory was initiated as a
   result of a 1959 senate report (Senate Document 59) entitled "Facility
   Needs-Soil and Water Conservation Research" developed by a working
   group appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture. Droughts and severe
   winters in the early 1970s raised concerns about the effect of these
   conditions on our nations food supply. In 1977, Congress appropriated
   $100,000 for a feasibility study by a "Blue Ribbon Committee" of
   distinguished scientists who concluded that Lubbock, Texas, would be an
   ideal location for this Laboratory (U.S. Congress Senate report on the
   Agriculture and Related Agencies Appropriates Bill, 1978). In fiscal
   year 1979, Congress appropriated $800,000 to initiate planning for the
   research program and proposed facility in cooperation with Texas Tech
   University at Lubbock. In 1988 the 100th Congress passed and the
   President signed Public Law 100-339 authorizing the construction of the
   Plant Stress and Water Conservation Laboratory at Lubbock, Texas. Final
   funding of $8,100,000 for construction of the laboratory was
   appropriated in 1997 and construction was completed in spring of 1999.

   The research program has grown during the time since the report in 1978
   as scientists with diverse research backgrounds joined to form a
   multidisciplinary research team. The College of Agricultural Sciences
   and Natural Resources provided continuous support throughout the
   development of the plant stress program.  The planning and design of
   the Plant Stress and Water Conservation Laboratory involved a unique
   partnership between USDA-ARS, Texas Tech University, and the Texas A&M
   University System Agricultural Programs. This is most clearly
   demonstrated by the "Partnership Declaration developed from a summit
   meeting held in December of 1998, to develop a framework for further
   development of the research program and coordination of the effort of
   the three institutions.
