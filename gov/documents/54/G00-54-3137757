    The Reverse Buyer Auction is a web-enabled capability where the buyer
       initiates an auction for purchasing commodities and selects the
      suppliers with whom the auction will be conducted. Suppliers are
      selected in accordance with acquisition regulations and contract
                          provisions. [learn more]

   Note: Reverse Auctions is an operational pilot to implement auctioning
    and aggregation capabilities within the Government. Please check back
                       often for news and information.
