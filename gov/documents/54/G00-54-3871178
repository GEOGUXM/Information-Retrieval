   Purge Spurge:
   Leafy Spurge Database Version 4.0
     __________________________________________________________________

   CD cover Evaluation copies of the latest version of the award-winning
   "Purge Spurge: Leafy Spurge Database" CD-ROM were distributed at TEAM
   Leafy Spurge's "Spurgefest II" event held in Medora, North Dakota in
   June 2001. Currently undergoing final revisions, "Purge Spurge Version
   4.0" will be complete and ready for widespread distribution in late
   August 2001.

   The original CD, last published in 1995, featured more than 400
   research reports, abstracts, bulletins, conference proceedings and
   other articles, photos, maps and illustrations on leafy spurge and its
   management. It earned a Federal Technology Leadership Award as well as
   enthusiastic accolades from its many users on the frontlines of the
   battle against this pervasive noxious weed.

   More than 800 documents are included in this newest version of "Purge
   Spurge" along with an extended bibliography listing hundreds more. The
   CD also includes a complete collection of Leafy Spurge Symposium
   abstracts and proceedings beginning with the meeting's inception in
   1979 through 2001, along with numerous photos, maps, tables and more.

   The new version uses Adobe Acrobat's portable document format for easy
   printing and better handling of tables and graphics. The CD is both Mac
   and PC compatible and is fully searchable. Ultimately, TEAM Leafy
   Spurge plans to place the information from the CD on this web site,
   ensuring even broader access for those most in need of it, the
   landowners and managers combating this pernicious weed.
