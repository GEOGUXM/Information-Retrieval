                 Dioxins
     __________________________________________________________________


   The Bay Area Air Quality Management District, in cooperation with the
   California Air Resources Board and the US Environmental Protection
   Agency, has established an ambient air dioxin monitoring network.
   The sampling sites, currently operating on a quarterly sampling
   schedule, are:
   Ft Cronkhite (site courtesy of GGNRA)
   San Jose - 4th Street
   Richmond - 7th Street and Hensley Street
   San Francisco - Arkansas Street
   Oakland - 68th & International

   There are plans to add the following sampling sites in the future:
   Crockett - Pomona Ave
   Livermore - Rincon Ave.

   Once samples are collected, extensive laboratory analysis is required
   to measure the amount of dioxins sampled.  Sampling data will then be
   available once all the required quality assurance and quality control
   procedures have been verified.

   Why should I be concerned about dioxins?
   Dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs are toxic compounds and have been shown to
   cause cancer and other health problems such as birth defects and liver
   damage.  They have a tendency to accumulate in the body and do not
   readily degrade.  Studies have estimated dioxin exposure in humans to
   be 95% from dietary intake of animal fats.

   Where do dioxins come from?

   Dioxin emissions, nation-wide, have been decreasing for the last 30
   years.  Dioxins are formed as a byproduct of combustion when materials
   containing chlorine are burned.  Sources of dioxin emissions include
   woodburning, diesel engines, and industrial sources such as municipal
   waste incineration, sludge incineration, and medical waste
   incineration.  However, dioxins may get into the environment through
   various mechanisms.  Historical reservoir sources such as lakes,
   sediments, and soil deposits can re-entrain dioxins into the
   environment, possibly resulting in human exposure.

   Are there ambient air quality standards for dioxins?

   Currently, neither the US EPA nor the State of California have adopted
   ambient standards for dioxins.  The California Air Resources Board has
   listed dioxins as a toxic air contaminant and the US EPA has them
   listed as a hazardous air pollutant.  EPA is actively researching the
   cancer risk associated with dioxin exposure and is attempting to
   determine the best strategy to reduce that risk, should it be
   determined to be too high.

   What's being measured?

   Dioxins & Dioxin-like PCBs:  Polychlorinated dibenzo-para-dioxins
   (7-PCDD Congeners), Polychlorinated dibenzofurans (10-PCDF Congeners),
   Coplanar polychlorinated biphenyl (7-PCB Congeners) compounds.
   Concentrations in the air are measured in femptograms (10^-15) grams,
   or one  quadrillionth of a gram, per cubic meter of air.

   How are the samples collected?

   The sampler draws ambient air through a two-stage filter assembly.  In
   the first stage, a quartz fiber filter collects all the particulate
   phase of the compounds and then the air passes through the second stage
   where polyurethane foam collects the vapor phase compounds.

   The sampler runs for 4 weeks, approximately 5-6 days per week.  During
   this time, 7,000 to 8,000 cubic meters of ambient air are drawn through
   the sample media.  The sample media is then sent to a specialized
   laboratory that will extract, concentrate, and analyze the sample for
   dioxin levels.

   When will the sampling data be available?

   Because the concentrations are in such small amounts, there are very
   extensive quality assurance and quality control measures must be
   followed during the sample media preparation, the sample collection,
   and the laboratory analysis.  Once all the QA and QC procedures have
   been verified for each sample, the data will be made available.  This
   process takes several months up to half a year, depending on the extent
   of quality control verification that may be required.

   What will be done with the information?

   The ambient data will be reviewed along with emission inventory data,
   modeling data, and other sources of information to estimate the health
   risk from dioxins in the San Francisco Bay Area.  The data should also
   be useful in estimating the extent to which dioxins in the air become a
   deposition problem for San Francisco Bay. The EPA has listed the Bay
   under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act as being impaired for a
   number of pollutants including dioxins and PCBs. This provision of the
   Clean Water Act requires a "Total Maximum Daily Load" or TMDL to be
   prepared. A TMDL is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant
   that a waterbody can receive and still meet water quality standards,
   and an allocation of that amount to the pollutant's sources (including
   atmospheric deposition).

   Comparisons of levels of ambient dioxins with other areas in the State
   and Nation will also be available, for those areas where similar
   measurements have been done.
