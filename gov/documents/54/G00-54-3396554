   access to Bankruptcy cases. We have further enhanced WebPacer to
   include images of selected filed documents

   All documents that are filed on or after January 1, 1998 will be
   scanned.



                             What about claims?

   Please note that claims are docketed and accessible in asset cases
   only. All claims that are filed on or after January 1, 1998 will be
