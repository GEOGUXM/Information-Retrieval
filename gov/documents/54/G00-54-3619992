   Project Management Career Development & Planning

   Career Development Path

   Do you think you might want to enter some phase of program/project
   management at GSFC, move ahead in your career field in support of
   program/project management, or perhaps change to a different career
   field? Or do you want to see if you've achieved the knowledge and
   skills that have been identified for your job category or what you
   would need to know for the next in your career? If the answer is "Yes"
   to either of these questions, then read on. This information is for
   you.
   NASA has developed a process to help employees and their supervisors
   proactively deal with change in the workplace. It involves assessing
   the employee's skills and expertise in relation to current or future
   job requirements and then identifying appropriate training and other
   developmental experiences.
   By participating in this process, employees take responsibility for
   their own career management. Employees focus on how development
   activities would improve current work performance and prepare them for
   possible new duties. Supervisors focus on current and changing job
   requirements, observed strengths and weaknesses of their employees, and
   the organization's changing needs.
   The Flight Programs and Projects Directorate has initiated a Career
   Development and Planning Program to allow it to combine both
   organizational and personal goals and guide individuals in making the
   necessary decisions for career development and planning. The process
   illustrated here will lead you to each decision-making point on your
   way to developing an Individual Development Plan (IDP). The links at
   the top provide other ways to navigate the site. Click on the Career
   Paths link to go directly to the diagrams that show you the various
   career paths you might take.

                          How to Navigate This Site

   There are two ways to navigate this site.
    1. Use the spiral diagram on this page or the text equivalents below
       to progress through the seven steps that comprise the FPPD Career
       Development process. Along the way, you will be asked to download
       and complete several worksheets and complete an assessment
       exercise. You will also have the opportunity to read or link to
       various references such as job descriptions, core and technical
       matrices, a list of mentors, career paths, training opportunities,
       and workforce outlooks. The final in the process is the completion
       of an Individual Development Plan (IDP). A small version of the
       spiral is at the bottom of each screen. Click on the spiral to
       return to the Home Page. You can also go directly to another
       segment of the spiral by clicking on one of the options listed at
       the bottom of each page.
    2. Use the links at the top of this page to go to specific parts of
       the website. This will allow you to obtain the desired information
       without selecting a segment of the spiral to access the items.

   All pages and reference documents can be printed by using the "print"
   buttom at the top of your browser screen.
