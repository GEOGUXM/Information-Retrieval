                    The FIPS PUB 140-2 DTR is available.
    FIPS PUB 140-2 validation reports are now being accepted from the CMT
                                laboratories.

   The Computer Security Division at NIST maintains a number of
   cryptographic standards, and coordinates validation programs for many
   of those standards. The Cryptographic Module Validation (CMV) Program
   encompasses validation testing for cryptographic modules and
   algorithms:

   Cryptographic Modules
     * FIPS 140-1: Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules,
       January 4, 1994.
     * FIPS 140-2: Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, May
       25, 2001. Change Notice 1: 10/10/2001
       Cryptographic Algorithms
     * FIPS 46-3 and FIPS 81: Data Encryption Standard (DES) and DES Modes
       of Operation. FIPS 46-3 specifies the DES and Triple DES
       algorithms.
     * FIPS 186-2 and FIPS 180-1: Digital Signature Standard (DSS) and
       Secure Hash Standard (SHS), which specify the DSA, RSA, ECDSA, and
       SHA-1 algorithms
     * FIPS 185: Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES), which specifies the
       Skipjack algorithm

   The CMV Program was established by NIST and the Communications Security
   Establishment (CSE) of the Government of Canada in July 1995. All of
   the tests under the CMV Program are handled by third-party laboratories
   that are accredited as Cryptographic Module Testing (CMT) laboratories
   by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP).
   Vendors interested in validation testing may select any of the six
   accredited labs.

   A diagram is available, which maps the general flow of the CMVP testing
   process.
                     ___________________________________

   Two other cryptographic standards (MAC; ANSI X9.17 Key Management) no
   longer have active validation testing, but the standards remain in
   effect. Cryptographic module (FIPS 140-1) validation testing by the CMT
   laboratories may include testing for conformance to FIPS 113 and 171,
   as appropriate:

     * FIPS 113: Computer Data Authentication, which specifies the
       generation of a Message Authentication Code (MAC), from ANSI X9.9,
       and
     * FIPS 171: Key Management Using ANSI X9.17.
                     ___________________________________

   Information Technology Laboratory at NIST, please take a look at the
   Directory of Conformance Testing Programs, Products, and Services.
