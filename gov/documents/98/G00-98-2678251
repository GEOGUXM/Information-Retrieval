   Welcome to my personal homepage!  Hopefully this will be a little bit
   of an intro into my exciting life here at Woods Hole.......Thanks for
   taking the time to visit.

   I am currently working for the U.S. Geological Survey in Woods Hole,
   Massachusetts.  I am involved in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine
   Sanctuary Mapping Project, in which we are focusing on developing the
   first full-coverage, detailed maps of the region.  The Stellwagen Bank
   National Marine Sanctuary is a newly designated sanctuary located
   approximately 25 miles off the coast of Boston, Massachusetts (location
   map).  The sanctuary supports both commercial and recreational fishing
   and serves as habitat for marine mammals including the endangered right
   whale.    The objectives of the project include the mapping and
   characterization of the Stellwagen Bank region in terms of: geologic
   structure and stratigraphy; texture and morphology; sediment movement;
   impact of physical disturbance by storms, trawling, and dredging; and
   distribution of benthic species in relation to habitats and near-bottom
   flow. My co-worker Tanya Unger and I are in charge of the GIS and image
   processing components of the project, however we are also involved in
   going out to sea and doing field work, collecting more digital data and
   grab samples, as well as hopefully utilizing a submersible this summer.
   I work for Page Valentine, who is the Project Chief.
