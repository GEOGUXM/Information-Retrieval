                              Magnetic Particle

                                General Uses:

     * Location and identification of surface or near-surface defects on
       or in ferromagnetic materials.

                          Examples of Applications:

     * Fatigue cracks in steel dies.
     * Shrinkage in machined castings.
     * Stringers or cold shunts in forgings after finish machining.

                                Test Samples:

                  Virtually any size sample is acceptable.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Limitations:

   The sample must be ferromagnetic thus this technique can not be used on
                           most stainless steels.
