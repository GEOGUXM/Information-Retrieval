      About the CIA

      The Central Intelligence Agency was created in 1947 with the signing of
      the National Security Act by President Truman. The National Security
      Act charged the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI)  with
      coordinating the nations intelligence activities and correlating,
      evaluating and disseminating intelligence which affects national
      security.

      George J. Tenet was confirmed on July 10, 1997, and is the current
      Director of Central Intelligence (DCI).  The DCI serves as the head of
      the United States Intelligence Community, principal advisor to the
      President for intelligence matters related to national security, and
      head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

      The CIA is an independent agency, responsible to the President through
      the DCI, and accountable to the American people through the
      intelligence oversight committees of the U.S. Congress.

      CIAs mission is to support the President, the National Security
      Council, and all officials who make and execute the U.S. national
      security policy by:
        * Providing accurate, comprehensive, and timely foreign intelligence
          on national security topics.
        * Conducting counterintelligence activities, special activities, and
          other functions related to foreign intelligence and national
          security, as directed by the President.

      To accomplish its mission, the CIA engages in research, development,
      and deployment of high-leverage technology for intelligence purposes.
      As a separate agency, CIA serves as an independent source of analysis
      on topics of concern and also works closely with the other
      organizations in the Intelligence Community to ensure that the
      intelligence consumer-whether Washington policymaker or battlefield
      commander-receives the best intelligence possible.

      As changing global realities have reordered the national security
      agenda, CIA has met these new challenges by:
        * Creating special, multidisciplinary centers to address such
          high-priority issues such as nonproliferation, counterterrorism,
          counterintelligence, international organized crime and narcotics
          trafficking, environment, and arms control intelligence.
        * Forging stronger partnerships between the several intelligence
          collection disciplines and all-source analysis.
        * Taking an active part in Intelligence Community analytical efforts
          and producing all-source analysis on the full range of topics that
          affect national security.
        * Contributing to the effectiveness of the overall Intelligence
          Community by managing services of common concern in imagery
          analysis and open-source collection and participating in
          partnerships with other intelligence agencies in the areas of
          research and development and technical collection.

      By emphasizing adaptability in its approach to intelligence collection,
      the CIA can tailor its support to key intelligence consumers and help
      them meet their needs as they face the issues of the post-Cold War
      World.
