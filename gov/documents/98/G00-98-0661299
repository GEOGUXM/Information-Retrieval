   Botanical Details

   For Searches, use of Botanical Names is encouraged whenever possible.
   Common names are included only for convenience. Many plant species have
   several common names and others none at all, and some names are used
   differently in different regions. Lesser-known common names have been
   changed to names familiar in the U.S.

   Botanical names include family, genus, species, and occasionally
   variety (FSGV),
   e.g. Cruciferae: Brassica oleracea var. capitata.

   Common names are listed with the primary name first followed by
   appropriate modifiers,
   e.g. clover, white New Zealand.
