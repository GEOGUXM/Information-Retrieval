   three-dimensional (3D) structure of solar active region NOAA 7986
   observed on 1996 August 30 with the Extrem-ultraviolet Imaging
   Telescope (EIT) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO)
   is analyzed. We develop a new method of Dynamic Stereoscopy to
   reconstruct the 3D geometry of dynamically changing loops, which allows
   us to determine the orientation of the loop plane with respect to the
   line-of-sight, a prerequisite to correct properly for projection
   effects in 3D loop models. With this method and the filter-ratio
   technique applied to EIT 171 *A and 195 *A images we determine the 3D
   coordinates [x(s); y(s); z(s)], the loop width w(s), the electron
   density ne(s), and the electron temperature Te(s) as function of the
   loop length s for 30 loop segments. Fitting the loop densities with an
   exponential density model ne(h) we find that the mean of inferred scale
   height temperatures, T *e = 1:22 \Sigma 0:23 MK, matches closely that
   of EIT filter-ratio temperatures, T EITe = 1:21 \Sigma 0:06 MK. We
   conclude that these cool and rather large-scale loops (with heights of
   h ss 30 \Gamma 225 Mm) are in hydrostatic equilibrium. Most of the
   loops show no significant thickness variation w(s), but we can measure
   for most of them a positive temperature gradient (dT =ds ? 0) across
   the first scale height above the footpoint. Based on these temperature
   gradients we find that the - 2 - conductive loss rate is about two
   orders of magnitude smaller than the radiative loss rate, which is in
   strong contrast to hot active region loops seen in SXR. We infer a mean
   radiative loss time of o/rad ss 40 minutes. For steady state models,
   the heating rate has to balance the radiative loss, i.e. the heating
   rate has to scale with the squared density (EH / n2e). No correlation
   between the heating rate EH and the magnetic field B is found. The
   potential field model (computed from MDI magnetograms) is found to
   represent well the coronal magnetic field traced out by EIT loops. The
   thermal pressure is found to be smaller than the magnetic pressure
   everywhere in the EIT loops. The Alfv'en velocity is highest near the
   loop footpoints (vA ss 2000 \Gamma 6000 km s\Gamma 1) and reaches
   asymptotic values (vA ss 500 \Gamma 1000 km s\Gamma 1) in the upper
   parts of the loops. Subject headings: Sun: corona -- Sun : active
   regions -- Sun: EUV -- Techniques: 3D stereoscopy 1. INTRODUCTION The
   evolution of coronal plasma loops, beginning from the well-kept secret
   of the elusive heating mechanism, to the somewhat better understood
   conductive and radiative cooling processes, and the various transitions
   from steady-state to non-equilibrium states, still represents a key
   problem of coronal plasma physics. Because the average temperature of
   the solar corona ranges around Te ss 1:5 MK, this temperature seems to
   reflect the most likely steady-state condition of coronal structures,
   demarcating at the same time a watershed where cooling and heating
   processes start to lose equilibrium. It is therefore a physically
   meaningful choice to distinguish between cool and hot loops with
   respect to this maximum likelyhood temperature Te ss 1:5 MK, which also
   separates roughly the line formation temperatures in the EUV/XUV and
   SXR wavelength regimes. Coronal loops in EUV/XUV wavelengths could only
   be studied with few instruments, mainly from the two spacecraft
   missions SKYLAB and SoHO, and from a few short-duration rocket flights
   (e.g. AS&E, HRTS, or SERTS). The scarce EUV observations before the
   launch of SoHO provided little systematic information on the physical
   structure of cooler active region loops in the temperature regime of Te
   !, 1:5 MK, opposed to the much more frequently studied hotter loops (Te
   ?, 1:5 MK) in soft X-rays (with OSO-8, P78-1, Hinotori, SMM/XRP,
   Yohkoh/SXT, Coronas, SoHO/EIT and CDS, etc.). A number of statistical
   studies exist on hot active region loops observed in SXRs (e.g.
   Pallavicini, Serio, & Vaiana 1977; Rosner, Tucker, & Vaiana 1978;
   Porter & Klimchuk 1995; Klimchuk & Gary 1995; Kano & Tsuneta 1995,
   1996), but there is no comparable statistics available on cooler active
   region loops observed at temperatures of Te = 1:0 \Gamma 1:5 MK in EUV.
   Moreover, not much effort has been invested in the 3-dimensional
   reconstruction of coronal loops at any wavelength so far (although the
   technology is ready, see e.g. Gary 1997). This study represents a first
   comprehensive statistical study on physical parameters of cool active
   region loops in the Te = 1:0 \Gamma 1:5 MK temperature range, measured
   with unprecedented accuracy using a newly developed 3-dimensional
   reconstruction method called Dynamic Stereoscopy. Let us shortly review
   some highlights of earlier work on EUV loops in the Te ss 1:0 \Gamma
   1:5 MK temperature range. A comprehensive account on literature before
   1991 can be found in Bray et al. (1991). The Skylab XUV
   spectroheliograph provided images with 2"-3" resolution at wavelengths
   of 180-630 *A , including the Mg IX line with a formation temperature
   of Te = 0:9 MK. Dere (1982) analyzed such XUV loops and found (1) that
   they are close to hydrostatic equilibrium (within the uncertainties of
   the unknown 3D geometry) and (2) that hot (Te ? 1 MK) loops do not have
   a cool core structure as suggested by Foukal - 3 - (1975). Sheeley
   (1980) studied the temporal variability of EUV loops and found
   lifetimes of ss 1:5 hours for 1 MK loops, somewhat longer than those of
   0.5 MK loops. This lifetime of 1 MK loops, estimated by Sheeley from
   time-lapse movies, is actually close to the value we infer for the
   radiative cooling time from SoHO/EIT data. Observations with SERTS
   revealed that the brightest structures seen in Mg IX are not spatially
   coincident with hotter coronal loops seen in SXR, but are rooted in
   chromospheric He II features, and thus seem to trace out cooler coronal
   loops with apex temperatures of Te !, 1 MK (Brosius et al. 1997). The
   existence of numerous cooler loops has also been postulated from the
   observed discrepancy between SXR-inferred temperatures of active
   regions and simultaneous radio brightness temperature measurements,
   because the former include only the contributions from hot loops, while
   the latter are sensitive to the combined free-free opacity of both hot
   and cool loops (Webb et al. 1987; Nitta et al. 1991; Schmelz et al.
   1992, 1994; Brosius et al. 1992; Klimchuk & Gary 1995; Vourlidas &
   Bastian 1996). The most recent work on EUV loops comes from SoHO/EIT
   (Neupert et al. 1998; Aschwanden et al. 1998a,b) and SoHO/CDS (Fludra
   et al. 1997; Brekke et al. 1997). Neupert et al. (1998) analyzed a
   long-lived loop structure and an open-field radial feature and found
   (1) that they are close to hydrostatic equilibrium (within the
   uncertainties of the unknown 3D geometry), and (2) that radiative
   energy loss strongly dominates conductive energy loss at these loop
   temperatures of Te = 1:0 \Gamma 1:5 MK, requiring a heating function
   that scales with the squared density, EH / n2e. The temporal
   variability and lifetime of EUV loops can now best be studied from
   SoHO/EIT movies (Newmark et al. 1997). What progress can we expect from
   a new analysis of active region loops, using the most recent EUV data
   available from SoHO/EIT? To accomplish sensible tests of theoretical
   models on heating and cooling processes, accurate physical parameters
   from resolved single loops are needed. However, most of previous
   literature deals with line-of-sight averaged quantities without
   discriminating between single loops. For a proper determination of
   physical parameters from single active region loops, a number of
   analysis problems have to be overcome:\Gamma geometric loop
   definition,\Gamma identification and tracing of loops in images,\Gamma
   disentangling of nested loops,\Gamma separation of overlying or
   closely-spaced loops,\Gamma discrimination of mulitple loops along the
   line-of-sight,\Gamma 3-dimensional reconstruction of loop geometry and
   de-projection,\Gamma temperature discrimination along the
   line-of-sight,\Gamma reliable temperature and emission-measure
   determination. Most of these problems have not been treated in a
   systematic way in previous studies. Here we present the results of a
   new approach, making use of the principle of dynamic stereoscopy to
   reconstruct the 3-dimensional orientation of loops, which provides a
   reliable method to obtain more accurate physical parameters as function
   of the loop length, which can be used to test theoretical loop models
   and coronal heating models. Future studies with the same method are
   planned for hotter loops (using SoHO/EIT, CDS, and Yohkoh/SXT data). In
   Section 2 we describe the stereoscopic data analysis of 30 loops
   observed with SoHO/EIT at a wavelength of 175 *A . In Section 3 we
   apply physical loop models to the data and investigate loop scaling
   laws. A summary and conclusions are given in Section 4. - 4 - 2.
   STEREOSCOPIC DATA ANALYSIS 2.1. Data Set The investigated active region
   is a long-lived coronal structure that was present during several solar
   rotations, from its apparition in July 1996 until its disappearance in
   September 1996 (Hudson et al. 1998; Harvey & Hudson 1998;
   Portier-Fozzani et al.1998), numbered as NOAA 7978, 7981, 7986 during
   consecutive rotations. We concentrate here on the central meridian
   transit on 1996 Aug 30, when the dipolar magnetic field structure
   offered the most favorable perspective to disentangle the "jungle" of
   nested loops. An Fe IX/X image recorded with SOHO/EIT (Delaboudini`ere
   et al. 1995) at a wavelength of 171 *A on 1996-Aug-30, 0020:14 UT, is
   shown in Fig.1 (top). For stereoscopic correlations we will use also
   EIT images from the previous (1996-Aug-29, 0015:15 UT) and following
   day (1996-Aug-31, 0010:14 UT). The multi-loop structure of this active
   region is clearer visible in the high-pass filtered rendering shown in
   Fig.1 (bottom) The filtered image is simply created by subtracting a
   smoothed image (with a boxcar average over 3 \Theta 3 pixels) from the
   original image. The original (full disk) image has a pixel size of
   2.616" and was recorded with an exposure time of 3.5 s. The absolute
   coordinate system of the full-disk image was established by fitting a
   circle to the solar limb (at 30 limb positions). The accuracy of the
   so-defined Sun center position is estimated to be oex ss 1 pixel=p30 ss
   0:2 pixel. The offset of the Sun center position (x00; y00) provided
   (by an automatic limb fitting routine) in the FITS header of the
   archive EIT image with respect to our value (x0; y0) is found to be
   (x00 \Gamma x0) = +0:5 and (y00 \Gamma y0) = \Gamma 3:9 pixels. For the
   solar radius we find a difference of (r00 \Gamma r0) = \Gamma 1:2
   pixels. The EIT pixel size of \Delta x = 2:616" is corrected for
   spacecraft orbit (by a factor of 1:01) and the chromospheric height of
   the limb (by a factor of 1:0036). 2.2. Dynamic Stereoscopy Method In
   order to analyze the 3-dimensional structure of coronal loops we
   develop a new technique we might call "Dynamic Stereoscopy", opposed to
   "Static Stereoscopy", where the solar rotation is used to vary the
   aspect angle of otherwise static structures (e.g. Loughhead, Chen &
   Wang 1984; Berton & Sakurai 1985; Aschwanden & Bastian 1994a,b; Davila
   1994; Aschwanden et al. 1995; Aschwanden 1995). The innovative feature
   of this new technique is that spatial structures, e.g. coronal loops,
   are allowed to evolve dynamically during the time interval over which
   the stereoscopic correlation is performed. In the Dynamic Stereoscopy
   method we take advantage of the fact that the global magnetic field is
   slowly evolving (say during a day) compared with heating and cooling
   processes in coronal loops. Consequently, the coronal magnetic field
   B(x; t) can be considered as invariant over short time scales, while
   the confined plasma can flow through "magnetic conduits" in a highly
   dynamic manner. If a specific coronal fluxtube following a field line
   B(x; t1) is loaded with bright plasma at time t1, the same fluxtube may
   be cooled down at time t2 (say a day later) and invisible at the same
   observed wavelength, while heating may occur in an adjacent fluxtube
   B(x + \Delta x; t2), which was dark at time t1 and appears now bright
   at time t2. For adjacent fluxtubes, the two field lines B(x) and B(x +
   \Delta x) will run almost parallel, a property we will exploit in our
   dynamic stereoscopy method. Our method is applicable to coronal
   structures that meet the following two conditions: 1. The global
   magnetic vector field B(x; t) is static (or slowly-varying) during the
   time interval over - 5 - which stereoscopic correlations are performed
   (typically 1 day). The magnetic field can be traced out by
   optically-thin emission (e.g. in soft X-ray or EUV wavelengths). 2. At
   least one footpoint of an observed coronal loop is identifiable, which
   can be used as a reference level of the altitude. For EUV emission we
   assume that the altitude of a loop footpoint is located in the lower
   corona above the chromosphere, at an altitude of hfoot ss 2500 km above
   the photosphere. We outline briefly the numerical procedure of our
   implementation of the dynamic stereoscopy method, while the
   mathematical coordinate transformations are given in Appendix A. The
   projected geometry of a loop segment in an image at time t1 is traced
   out by a series of image coordinates (xi; yi); i = 1; :::; n, starting
   at footpoint position (x1; y1), assumed to be anchored at height hfoot
   (Fig.2). Two additional variables to characterize the 3D geometry of
   the loop segment are the azimuth angle ff of the footpoint baseline,
   and the inclination angle # of the mean loop plane (intersecting the
   footpoint baseline, see Fig.2). The procedure of stereoscopic
   correlation (illustrated in Fig.3) includes the following steps: 1.
   Measuring of positions (xi; yi); i = 1; :::; nj by tracing a loop
   segment in an image recorded at time t1, starting with the primary
   footpoint at (x1; y1). 2. Estimating the position of the secondary
   footpoint (xF2; yF2) to obtain the azimuth angle ff of the footpoint
   baseline. If the full length of the loop can be traced, the secondary
   footpoint is just given by the last point xn; yn, and the tangens of
   the azimuth angle ff corresponds to the ratio of the latitude (bF2
   \Gamma bF1) and longitude difference (lF2 \Gamma lF1 ) of the two
   footpoints, i.e. tan(ff) = (bF 2 \Gamma bF1) (lF2 \Gamma lF1) : (1)
   However, most of the loops analyzed here extend over several density
   scale heights, so that only a segment above the primary footpoint can
   be traced out, while the location of the secondary footpoint has to be
   estimated based on the general dipole characteristic of the ambient
   magnetic topology. We repeat the localization of the secondary
   footpoint 5 times and obtain from these estimates ffj; j = 1; :::; 5 a
   mean and standard deviation ff \Sigma dff. 3. The loop positions (xi;
   yi) measured in the image at time t1 are then transformed into
   heliographic longitude and latitude coordinates (lij; bij) and
   altitudes (hij), based on the azimuth angle ff of the footpoint
   baseline and the variable inclination angle #j, which is varied over a
   range of\Gamma 900 ! #j ! +900 in increments of \Delta # = 10. 4. The
   heliographic coordinate lij(t1) is then transformed to the time t2 of
   the second stereoscopic pair image, l0ij(t2), using the solar
   differential rotation rate applied to the time interval (t2 \Gamma t1).
   We use the differential rotation rate specified by Allen (1973), l0(t2)
   = l(t1) + [13:450 + 30 sin2(B)] (t2 \Gamma t1)1 day : (2) The
   heliographic latitude bij and altitude hij are assumed to be constant
   during the considered time interval. 5. In the stereoscopic pair image
   at time t2 we calculate the image coordinates (x0ij; y0ij) of the
   projected loop structure. Parallel to these loop curves (with typical
   lengths of ns = 50 \Gamma 200 pixels) we extract image stripes of some
   width (nw = 16 pixels) by interpolating the image brightness F (x; y)
   at the positions of the curved coordinate grid. - 6 - 6. The stretched
   2D image stripes (ns \Theta nw pixels) are then scanned for parallel
   brightness ridges, caused by "dynamic" structures that are co-aligned
   (or parallel-displaced) to the loop projection in image t2 (for
   illustration see examples shown in lower panels of Fig.3). This
   scanning process is numerically performed by measuring the total length
   L(#k) of coaligned brightness ridges that are detected in each stripe k
   associated with each angle #j. The maximum of this quantity
   (max[L(#k)]) is used to infer the most likely value of the inclination
   angle # of the loop plane. 7. The same procedure is repeated in forward
   and backward direction in time. The mean and standard deviation of #
   \Sigma d# is determined by averaging the two stereoscopic solutions
   (\Sigma 1 day). The independent stereoscopic correlation in forward (+1
   day) and backward (\Gamma 1 day) direction provides a useful redundancy
   of the solution. The time difference of \Sigma 1 day corresponds to an
   aspect angle change of\Sigma 13:50. Except for steps 1-2, which
   constitute the definition of a selected loop feature, all other steps
   (3-7) of the stereoscopic correlation are performed automatically by a
   numeric code without human interaction. The determination of the loop
   inclination angle # is therefore achieved in a most objective way,
   within the principle of dynamic stereoscopy. 2.3. Loop Geometry With
   the dynamic stereoscopy method described above we analyzed the
   3-dimensional (3D) coordinates of 30 loops from the EIT 171 *A image on
   1996-Aug-30 (Fig.4, middle column). The true 3D geometry of (the
   central axis) of a coronal loop can be characterized with three
   orthogonal spatial coordinates [x(si); y(si); z(si)]; i = 1; :::; n,
   parametrized by the loop length parameter si. When we trace a loop
   structure in an image (see Fig.4, panels in middle column), we can
   accurately measure the two coordinates [x(si); y(si)], without imposing
   any geometric constraint on its shape, opposed to a method that fits a
   predefined geometric model (e.g. a circular geometry or its elliptic
   projection). We impose only some constraints on the third coordinate
   z(si), namely assuming that the loop segment is confined into a plane,
   whose orientation we quantify with two free parameters (Fig.2): with
   the azimuth angle ff (of the loop footpoint baseline) and the
   stereoscopically measured inclination angle # (with respect to the
   vertical). One additional constraint is also introduced by the
   reference level h(s1) of the first footpoint position, assumed to be
   located at a fixed height of h(s1) = hfoot ss 2:5 Mm. Some geometric
   elements of the analyzed 30 loops are listed in Table 1: the
   heliographic longitude (l1) and latitude (b1) position of the primary
   footpoint [x(s1); y(s1); h(s1) = hfoot], the azimuth angle ff of the
   footpoint baseline measured at the primary footpoint, and the
   inclination angle # of the loop plane. The average heliographic
   position of the 30 loop footpoints is ! lF1 ?= 251:00; ! bF1 ?= \Gamma
   11:80, which is slightly southward of the Sun center position at this
   time, l0 = 255:80, b0 = 7:20. The average azimuth angle (modulo 1800)
   of the 30 loop footpoint baselines is ff = \Gamma 30 \Sigma 100, which
   represents the global orientation of the large-scale dipolar magnetic
   field that dominates the active region, that was used as a guide to
   estimate the azimuth angle of the footpoint baseline for individual
   loop segments. The only complete loop that could be traced out (without
   gaps between the footpoints) is Loop #1, which has an azimuth angle of
   ff = 150 \Sigma 10. The inclination angles # of the loop planes cover a
   large range from # = \Gamma 560 to # = +690, having an average of ! #
   ?= 70 \Sigma 370. The southern loops (Loops #1-11, 23-30) show all an
   inclination toward south (with # negative if the primary footpoint is
   to the East), while the northern loops (Loops #12-22) - 7 - show a
   systematic inclination toward North (with # positive if the primary
   footpoint is to the East). This fan-shaped divergence of loop planes is
   consistent with the overall magnetic dipolar field, having the dipole
   axis aligned to the East-West direction. We visualize the 3D structure
   of the stereoscopically reconstructed 30 loops in Fig.5, where
   different perspectives and viewing angles are displayed. The traced
   segments (Fig.4) of the reconstructed loops are marked with thick lines
   in Fig.5, while the thin lines represent circular segments in the loop
   plane, constrained by the two footpoints and the endpoint of the traced
   segment. We rotated these reconstructed 30 loops by -7.2 days to the
   East (Fig.5 bottom left), in order to illustrate the distribution of
   inclination angles. The group of loops that are inclined to the South
   in our EIT image of 1996-Aug-30, are also found to have a similar
   configuration (with similar loop heights and loop plane inclinations)
   in an EIT image observed 7.2 days earlier, when this active region
   crossed the East limb (Fig.5 top left). 2.4. Loop Background
   Subtraction We parametrize the positions of the traced loop segments
   from the image coordinates [x(si); y(si)] as function of the
   (projected) loop length parameter si, by interpolating the coordinates
   with a constant resolution of \Delta si = si+1 \Gamma si = 1 pixel in
   the image plane. These positions mark the central axes of the analyzed
   loops. For single-loop analysis it is convenient to introduce a
   coordinate grid [si; tj] that is stretched out along the loop axis,
   with tj a coordinate orthogonal to the loop axis. The projections
   [x(si; tj); y(si; tj)] of these curved coordinate grids are shown in
   Fig.6 (top right panel). We parametrized both coordinates [si; tj] with
   a uniform resolution of 1 pixel, and have chosen a width of 16 pixels
   for the width of the stripes (tj), symmetrically bracketing the central
   loop axis. We show the flux F (tj) as function of the loop
   cross-section tj for each loop (#1\Gamma 30), and for each position si
   along the central loop axis with an incremental step of \Delta si = 1
   pixel in Fig.6, measured from the EIT 171 *A image of 1996-Aug-30. In a
   next step we attempt to separate the loop-associated fluxes from the
   loop-unrelated background. This is a very crucial step to determine the
   correct emission measure and electron density in a given loop. This
   task is difficult because most of the loops are very closely spaced and
   separated only by a few pixels at their primary footpoint (see Fig.6).
   Very few loops occur in an isolated environment (e.g. such as loop #25,
   see Figs.4-6). For many cross-sections there is not enough separation
   between adjacent loops to model the loop-unrelated background properly.
   The fact that the flux-unrelated background makes up typically 50-90%
   of the total EUV flux measured at a given line-of-sight (see Fig.7),
   indicates that we can separate out only a fraction of super-imposed and
   nested loops, like the top-most elements on the topological surface of
   a "strang of spaghettis". We tested various methods and found the
   following to be least susceptible to confusion by adjacent loops. We
   calculated the background profile FB(tj) to the observed flux F (tj) by
   cubic spline interpolation between various cross-section intervals [t1;
   t2], which were varied over a range of t0 \Gamma t1 = 1:::4 and t2
   \Gamma t0 = 1:::4 pixels (or 2-7 Mm for the half width of the loop
   cross-section) on both sides of the central loop axis (at t0). From the
   varied loop boundaries [t1; t2] those were used for the background
   envelope that maximize the flux of the loop cross-section, i.e. which
   yield the maximum ofR [F (tj) \Gamma FB(tj)]dtj. This method has the
   advantage to adjust for loop thickness variations, for offsets in
   tracing of the central axis, and for co-alignment errors between the
   171 and 195 *A image in the use of the filter-ratio technique. The
   so-determined loop-associated fluxes are shown with grey areas for each
   cross-section F (tj)js=si in Fig.6. The results show that the allowed
   loop half-width range of \Sigma 1 \Gamma 4 pixels separates most of the
   loops reasonably, except for occasional double loop detections near the
   primary footpoint. Such loop segments where the loop separation fails
   will be excluded in further analysis. - 8 - 2.5. Loop Cross-Sections We
   measured the loop width w(s) as function of the loop length parameter
   s, using the definition of the equivalent width w(s), w(s) = R F (s;
   tj) \Gamma FB(s; tj) dtjmax[F (s; t j) \Gamma FB(s; tj)] : (3) These
   loop widths w(s) are shown as function of the loop length s in Fig. 8
   for the 10 loops that are least confused by adjacent loops, as it can
   be judged from the cross-sections F (tj)js=si shown in Fig.6 (Loop #1,
   8, 11, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 25, 28). Performing a linear regression fit
   to the observed values w(s) we find a significant variation of the loop
   thickness only for two of them (Loop #20 and 28). To quantify the
   variation of the loop thickness we calculated a loop divergence factor,
   defined by the average width in the upper part (smax=2 ! s ! smax) to
   the lower part (0 ! s ! smax=2) of the traced loop segment. We remind
   that the traced loop segments generally extend over about one density
   scale height, but do often not reach the loop top (except for the
   smallest loop, #1). The loop divergence factors and their uncertainties
   are shown in Fig.8 (bottom right panel) for each loop. We caution that
   some of the loop thickness variation near the footpoints is due to
   separation problems of closely-spaced adjacent loops (as it can be
   judged from Fig.6). A histogram of average loop widths is shown in
   Fig.8 (top right panel), while the individual values w and their mean
   and standard deviation (w = 7100 \Sigma 800 km) are also listed in
   Table 1. The preference for such a narrow range of loop diameters is
   perhaps an instrumental resolution bias, because the finest
   recognizable structures are most likely to be seen at a scale
   corresponding to the size of a few pixels. 2.6. Loop Densities and
   Scale Heights For electron density and temperature diagnostics we are
   using a filter ratio technique applied to the EIT 171 *A and 195 *A
   wavelength images, based on the most recent EIT standard software
   (status of February 1989). The resulting emission measures EM and
   temperatures T EITe are based on the calculation of synthetic spectra
   using the CHIANTI data base, containing some 1400 emission lines in the
   150-400 *A wavelength range (Dere et al. 1997). For details of the EIT
   calibration the reader is referred to Delaboudini`ere et al. (1995),
   Moses et al. (1997), and Neupert et al. (1998). Further
   cross-calibrations of the EIT instrument with NRL rocket flights
   carrying an EIT duplicate instrument are in progress (led by Dan
   Moses). To determine the electron density ne(s) along individual loops,
   we use the background-subtracted EIT fluxes Floop(s) = F (s) \Gamma
   FB(s) in the filter ratios and the loop widths w(s). An additional
   important loop parameter is the line-of-sight angle (s), which provides
   a correction factor of the effective column depth for a loop with
   circular cross-section specified by a diameter w(s), i.e. wz(s) = w(s)=
   cos[(s)] (see Appendix B). With this parametrization we define the
   density ne(s) along a loop (normalized to a filling factor of unity) by
   ne(s) = sEM (s)w z(s) = s EM (s) cos[(s)] w(s) ; (4) with the loop
   length s(x; y) parametrized as a function of the image position (x; y),
   from where the EIT emission measure EM (x; y) is measured. Because the
   line-of-sight angle (s) is very sensitive to the loop orientation,
   correct values of the electron density ne(s) can only be obtained from
   an appropriate 3D model of the loop (constrained by stereoscopic
   correlations here). The projection effect of the loop curvature on - 9
   - the effective column depth wz(s), and the effect of the inclination
   angle # of the loop plane on the inferred density scale height *(#) are
   illustrated in Fig.9 (see also discussion in Alexander & Katsev 1996).
   The electron density ne(s) calculated from Eq.4 is shown graphically
   for the 10 least-confused loops (# 1,8,11,14,15,19,20,21,25,28) in
   Fig.10 (left panels). Because the height dependence s(h) of the loop
   length is known from our stereoscopic reconstruction (displayed in
   Fig.5), we can directly obtain the parametrization ne[s(h)] 7! ne(h)
   and fit an exponential density model, ne(h) = ne0 exp(\Gamma h*(T e) )
   (5) to obtain a scale-height temperature T *e , which is defined by
   (e.g. Lang 1980, p.285) *(Te) = kBTe_ m H g ss 46( Te 1M K ) [Mm] ; (6)
   with kB the Boltzmann constant, _ the mean molecular weight (_ ss 1:4
   for the solar corona), mH the mass of the hydrogen atom, and g the
   acceleration of gravity at the solar surface. The so obtained scale
   height *, with a mean of * = 55 \Sigma 10 Mm, and the inferred scale
   height temperature T *e , with a mean of T *e = 1:22 \Sigma 0:23, are
   listed in Tables 1 and 2 for each of the analyzed 30 loops. Loop
   segment ranges that are obviously confused by adjacent or crossing
   loops (as it can be judged from Fig.6), have been excluded in the
   fitting of the scale height model. We find that most of the analyzed
   loop segments fit closely an exponential density model (see Fig.10
   left). Deviations from an exponential density model can often be
   explained by uncertainties in the background subtraction, or by
   confusion from adjacent or overlying loops. 2.7. Loop Temperatures
   Independently of the scale height temperature T *e , we can also
   determine the temperature directly from the EIT filter ratio, which
   moreover provides a temperature differentiation along the loop, T EITe
   (s). Since our loop definitions are based on tracing of an EIT 171 *A
   image, we use only the filter ratio of EIT 171 *A (Fe IX,X) and 195 *A
   (Fe XII), which is sensitive in the temperature regime of Te = 1:0
   \Gamma 1:5 MK. We are using the spatial loop definition [x(s); y(s)]
   based on the 171 *A image, and apply the same background-subtraction
   technique to the 195 *A image, before we determine the temperature from
   the filter ratio (F 171 \Gamma F 171B )=(F 195 \Gamma F 195B ). Because
   our background-subtraction technique has some tolerance (of\Sigma 1
   \Gamma 4 pixels) in the localization of the loop cross-section (by
   maximizing the flux integrated over the loop cross-section), the
   filter-ratio is not susceptible to small co-alignment errors between
   the 171 and 195 *A image. The employed background-subtraction technique
   requires also a correlated structure (with a width of 2-8 pixels) in
   both wavelengths, while larger or diffuse structures with possibly
   different temperatures are safely subtracted out. The filter-ratio
   temperatures T EITe averaged over the loop segments are tabulated in
   Table 2, with a mean of T EITe = 1:21 \Sigma 0:06 MK. The distribution
   of filter-ratio temperatures N (T EITe ) is shown in Fig.11 (bottom
   left), along with the distribution of scale height temperatures N (T *e
   ) (Fig.11 top left), both having almost identical means. The range of
   scale height temperatures (\Sigma 0:23 MK) is broader than the range of
   EIT filter-ratio temperatures (\Sigma 0:06 MK), probably because of
   systematic errors in background subtraction and loop separation. This
   is also consistent with the scatterplot of the two temperature
   definitions (Fig.11 top right), where no obvious correlation is seen.
   Despite of these unavoidable uncertainties in the background
   subtraction, it is remarkable that the means of the two independently
   determined temperatures coincide so closely. - 10 - 2.8. Loop
   Temperature Gradients The detailed variation of the temperature T EITe
   (s) along the loop length s is shown for the 10 least-confused loops in
   Fig.10 (right panels). We note that the filter-ratio temperature varies
   sometimes discontinuously along the loop, e.g. there is a jump from Te
   = 1:35 MK to Te = 1:1 MK at s = 70 Mm in Loop #1 (Fig.10, top right),
   which may be caused by contamination from a hotter loop that is located
   almost parallel to Loop #1 at s ! 70 Mm (see cross-sections in Fig.6).
   Such confusion problems can only be identified in hindsight. Despite of
   such confusion problems, there seems to be a trend of a positive
   temperature gradient dT =ds ? 0 above the footpoint for most of the
   loops (Table 1). To estimate these average temperature gradients
   (without correcting for multi-loop confusion) we performed a linear
   regression Te(s) for all loops. The most significant temperature
   gradients are found for Loop #11 (dT =ds = +0:0049 MK/Mm), for Loop #20
   (dT =ds = +0:0012 MK/Mm), and for Loop #25 (dT =ds = +0:0054 MK/Mm),
   see examples in Fig.10 and Table 1. The distribution of temperature
   gradients N (dT =ds) is shown in Fig.11 (bottom right), revealing that
   ss 75% of the loops have a positive temperature gradient dT =ds ? 0
   across the first scale height above their footpoints. Higher parts (h
   ?, 1*) of these loops are not detectable in EIT images due to
   unsufficient density contrast (one scale height corresponds to a factor
   of ss 3 in density or a factor of ss 10 in emission measure or EIT
   flux). 2.9. Magnetic Field, Plasma-fi Parameter, and Alfv'en Velocity
   There is no accurate method available yet to determine the
   height-dependence of the coronal magnetic field, nor to trace the
   magnetic field along a particular active region loop. Some attempts are
   in progress to match loop geometries observed in SXR or EUV with
   potential field models (constrained by the photospheric boundary and
   projections of coronal loops; Gary 1997, Gary & Alexander 1998). As a
   first approximation to investigate the magnetic field along the
   observed EUV loops, we calculate here a potential field model of
   AR7986, using the code of Sakurai (1982) applied to a SoHO/MDI
   (Michelson-Doppler Imager) magnetogram, recorded at the same day as the
   EIT image (with a time difference of 20 hours). The potential field
   model is shown in Fig.12, overlaid on the MDI magnetogram, and
   coaligned with the traced EIT loops (by transforming the 3D field lines
   according to the solar rotation rate during the time difference). Note
   that the EUV loops represent independent tracers of the plasma along
   magnetic field lines, and thus convey an important test how good the
   coronal magnetic field is represented with a potential field model. The
   match of the traced EUV loops with the potential field shown in Fig.12
   is remarkably good, given the time difference of 20 hours and the
   non-potential structure implied by currents that are likely to be
   present in this active region, imposed by the observed filament along
   the neutral line. Detailed modeling with potential and force-free
   magnetic fields and investigating the best match with individual loops
   traced from EIT and SXT images will be pursued in a subsequent study.
   To estimate the magnetic field along the traced EIT loops we localize
   those potential field lines that have the closest footpoints to the EIT
   loop footpoints, and take the height-dependence of their magnetic field
   strength B(h) as a proxy for the EIT loops. The height-dependence of
   the magnetic field B(h) of the 30 potential field lines closest to the
   analyzed EIT loops is shown in Fig.13 (top). It can be approximated
   with a dipole model, B(h) = Bfoot\Gamma 1 + hh D \Delta \Gamma 3 ; (7)
   with a mean dipole depth of hD = 75 Mm and a range of footpoint field
   strenghts Bfoot ss 20:::150 G (dashed lines in Fig.13 top), or a mean
   of Bfoot ss 100 G. - 11 - With the potential field B(h) and the
   measured density ne(h) and temperature profiles Te(h) we can now
   determine the height-dependence of the plasma fi-parameter for each of
   the 30 analyzed loops, fi(h) = n(h)kTe(h)[B(h)2=8ss] ss 3:47 \Theta
   10\Gamma 15 ne(h)Te(h)B(h)2 ; (8) which quantifies the ratio of the
   thermal to the magnetic pressure, and thus provides a crucial criterion
   for magnetic confinement. The plasma-fi parameter is shown in Fig.13
   (middle), ranging typically at fi !, 0:1 in the entire coronal range (h
   !, 200 Mm ) of the EUV loops. We find only 2 (out of 30 loops) that
   exceed the critical limit of fi * 1, possibly implying currents and
   non-potential magnetic fields along the loops. Gary & Alexander (1998)
   found such regimes with fi ?, 1 in the upper corona h ?, 0:2Rfi from
   analysis of SXR loops, in contrast to the common belief that the
   coronal value is always fi o/ 1 (Priest 1981; Tandberg-Hanssen & Emslie
   1988; Yokoyama & Shibata 1997; Sakurai 1989; Gary 1990; McClymont,
   Jiao, & Miki'c 1997). Reliable measurements of the plasma-fi parameter
   require fully resolved structures, such as single loops analyzed here
   (save for unknown filling factors), while line-of-sight averaged
   densities are expected to underestimate the density in loop structures,
   and thus are biased towards too low fi-values. A further plasma
   parameter that is of interest for coronal loop dynamics is the Alfv'en
   velocity, which can be computed along individual loops thanks to the
   knowledge of the magnetic field B(h) and density ne(h), vA(h) =
   B(h)p4ssn i(h)mi ss 2:18 \Theta 10 11 B(h)p ne(h) cm s \Gamma 1 : (9)
   This quantity is shown in Fig.13 (bottom). The Alfv'en velocity is
   found to be hightest near the footpoints of the analyzed EUV loops,
   ranging from vA(h = 0) ss 1000 to 7000 km/s, and is dropping off
   steadily with larger height, to a characteristic value of vA(h ?, 100
   Mm) ss 500 \Gamma 800 km/s. 3. PHYSICAL MODELS AND DISCUSSION The
   density and temperature diagnostics obtained as function of 3D space
   coordinates allows us to investigate the physical conditions in the
   analyzed loops and to test some theoretical loop models and scaling
   laws. The major benefit of this study is that the loop geometry is
   well-determined by the data, so that no geometric assumptions have to
   be made in the application of theoretical loop models. 3.1. Loop Length
   Parametrization Because the thermal energy is generally much smaller
   than the magnetic energy in the corona (plasma parameter fi =
   nekBTe=(B2=8ss) o/ 1), energy transport in coronal loops can be reduced
   to one dimension, as function of the loop length parameter s. In our
   analysis we detected, except for one complete loop, only segments of
   loops that extend about one scale height above the primary footpoint.
   We will denote the start of the traced loop segments at the primary
   footpoint with s = 0, the end of the traced loop segment with s = L1,
   and the full loop length extending all the way to the secondary
   footpoint with s = L. By localizing the secondary footpoint of traced
   loops from the global dipolar magnetic field of the active region, we
   obtained the approximate azimuth angle and length of the footpoint
   baseline. Using the stereoscopically determined inclination angle # and
   the azimuth angle ff of the footpoint baseline (Fig.2), we were able to
   project the 3D loop coordinates into the loop plane X-Z (Eq.A5). In
   this loop plane we can approximate - 12 - the loop geometry with a
   circular function, by interpolating the 3 loop positions (s = 0; L1; L)
   with the circle parametrization [X(OE); Y (OE)], X = R0 cos(') (10) Z =
   R0 sin(') + Z0 (11) yielding the circular loop radius R0 and the offset
   Z0 of the circle center from the footpoint baseline. The loop length
   s(') can now be parametrized as function of the circular angle ', s(')
   = R0 (' + '0) ; \Gamma '0 ^ ' ^ (ss + '0) ; (12) where the starting
   angle '0 is defined by the loop radius R0 and center offset Z0, '0 =
   arcsin( Z0R 0 ) : (13) The full loop length L is then L = R0(ss + 2'0)
   : (14) The geometric elements R0, Z0, L1, and L are listed in Table 1
   for all 30 loops. The same circular geometry was also used to visualize
   the extrapolated loop segments in Fig.5. For the application of the
   hydrostatic equilibrium equation we need also to quantify the height
   dependence h(s) of the loop length, which is determined by the loop
   plane inclination angle # and Eqs.8-10, h(s) = Z cos(#) = [Z0 + R0 sin(
   sR 0 + ' 0)] cos(#) : (15) The apexes or loop tops, htop = [Z0 + R0]
   cos(#), have a range of htop = 30 \Gamma 225 Mm in our sample of 30
   loops, and thus extend up to 4 scale heights (with * = 55 \Sigma 10
   Mm). 3.2. Static Loop Model In static loop models it is assumed that
   mass flows can be neglected, leading to the basic energy balance
   equation (e.g. Rosner, Tucker, & Vaiana 1978), EH(s) + ER(s) \Gamma
   rFC(s) = 0 (16) where EH denotes the rate of heat deposition, ER the
   energy radiated from the loop, and FC is the thermal conductive flux,
   to be balanced in at each location s of the loop in a static model. The
   conductive flux term can be expressed in one-dimensional form (with the
   Spitzer thermal conductivity ^ = 0:92 \Theta 10\Gamma 6 erg s\Gamma 1
   cm\Gamma 1 K\Gamma 7=2; Spitzer 1962) by rFC(s) = dds [\Gamma ^T 5=2(s)
   dT (s)ds ] ss \Gamma 52 ^T 3=2(s)\Theta dT (s)ds \Lambda 2 erg cm\Gamma
   3 s\Gamma 1 ; (17) where the approximation on the right-hand-side
   includes only the linearized temperature dependence T (s). The
   linearized temperature dependence can be written in terms of our
   measured temperature gradients (dT =ds) and mean temperatures T EITe
   listed in Table 2 by T (s) = T EITe + ( dTds )(s \Gamma L12 ) : (18) -
   13 - The conductive flux term rFC(s) in the energy balance equation
   (17) is calculated for s = 0 in Table 2, having a mean of ! r(Fc) ?=
   \Gamma 0:003 \Sigma 0:005 \Theta 10\Gamma 3 erg cm\Gamma 3 s\Gamma 1.
   The radiative loss term ER(s) can be written in terms of the electron
   density ne(s) and the radiative loss function \Lambda (T ), ER(s) =
   \Gamma ne(s)2\Lambda [T (s)] ergs cm\Gamma 3 s\Gamma 1 ; (19) which can
   be approximated with a constant value in our relatively narrow
   temperature range of interest (Te = 0:5 \Gamma 2:0 MK), \Lambda [T ] =
   10\Gamma 21:94 erg cm3s\Gamma 1 (105:75 ! T ! 106:3); (20) as
   calculated by Raymond, Cox, and Smith (1976) for solar abundances
   (Rosner et al. 1978). The radiative loss rate ER(s) is calculated for s
   = 0 in Table 2, having a mean of ! ER ?= \Gamma 0:46 \Sigma 0:29 \Theta
   10\Gamma 3 erg cm\Gamma 3 s\Gamma 1 for our 30 analyzed loops,
   surpassing the conductive loss rate by about two orders of magnitude
   (under the assumption of a filling factor of unity). The required
   heating rate has to balance essentially the radiative loss rate, i.e.
   EH ss \Gamma ER. The heating rate requirement EH is also listed in
   Table 2, with a mean of ! EH ?= +0:45 \Sigma 0:29 \Theta 10\Gamma 3 erg
   cm\Gamma 3 s\Gamma 1. Because the radiative loss rate is proportional
   to the squared density (Eq.19), for which we found an exponential
   decrease with height (Eq.5), the heating rate requirement follows a
   similar exponential relation, EH(s) ss \Gamma ER(s) ss n2e0\Lambda (T )
   exp[\Gamma 2h*(T ) ] ; (21) with an exponential scale height that
   equals half the density scale height. Such an exponential heating scale
   height sH , has been introduced, for instance in loop models of Serio
   et al. (1981), EH(s) = EH0 exp[\Gamma ss H ] ; (22) which has the
   following mean value for our group of EUV loops, sH = *=2 = 28 \Sigma 5
   Mm (see Table 1). The finding of hydrostatic equilibrium in all of our
   analyzed loops sheds some light on their thermal stability. While
   uniform-pressure loops were found to be thermally unstable under some
   conditions (e.g. if the base heat flux is too small), the influence of
   gravity (or hydrostatic equilibrium) has a stabilizing effect (Wragg &
   Priest 1982), which may partially explain the numerous existence of
   hydrostatic EUV loops observed by EIT during four solar rotations in
   this active region. 3.3. Loop Lifetime To investigate the lifetime of
   loops we have to consider the fastest of the energy loss time scales.
   The conductive loss time, o/cond = EthdE C=dt = 3nekbTer FC ss 1:1
   \Theta 10 \Gamma 9 ne T \Gamma 5=2L2 0 [s]; (23) is found to be o/cond
   ss 9 \Theta 105 s (or 10 days), using the average parameters from Table
   1, ne = 1:92 \Theta 109 cm\Gamma 3, T EITe = 1:22 \Theta 106 K, and L0
   = L=2 = 2:2 \Theta 1010 cm. The conductive loss time of EUV loops is
   therefore substantially longer than for SXR loops, for two reasons: (1)
   the temperature is cooler, and (1) the loop length is somewhat larger.
   If we compare typical SXR loops as observed with Yohkoh/SXT, where
   typical temperatures of T SXRe = 5 MK, densities of ne = 3 \Theta 109
   cm\Gamma 3, and loop lengths of LSXR = 1010 - 14 - cm were measured
   (Kano & Tsuneta 1995), we find conductive loss times of o/ SXRcond ss 8
   \Theta 103 s (or 2.4 hours). The huge difference in the conductive loss
   times of EUV and SXR loops comes mainly from the temperature factor, (T
   SXR=T EUV ) ss 5, which raised to the T \Gamma 5=2 power yields a ratio
   of o/ EUVcond o/ SXRcond ss \Gamma T EUV T SXR \Delta \Gamma 5=2 ss 55
   ; (24) i.e. a 55 times longer conductive loss time for EUV loops. Let
   us now estimate the radiative loss time of EUV loops (under the
   assumption of a filling factor of unity). The radiative lifetime is
   o/rad = EthdE R=dt = 3nekbTe n2e\Lambda (Te) ; (25) yielding a mean
   lifetime of o/rad ss 2:3 \Theta 103 s or about 40 minutes, based on our
   mean values ! ne ?= 1:92 \Theta 109 cm\Gamma 3, ! Te ?= 1:22 MK, and
   \Lambda (T ) = 10\Gamma 21:94 erg cm3 s\Gamma 1. Comparing the
   radiative lifetime of EUV loops with SXR loops, there is less of a
   difference than for the conductive loss time. The mean electron
   densities are similar, i.e. nEUVe ss 2 \Theta 109 cm\Gamma 3 versus
   nSXRe ss 3 \Theta 109 cm\Gamma 3 (Kano & Tsuneta 1995), and the
   radiative loss function has a somewhat smaller value at SXR
   temperatures, i.e. \Lambda (T EUV ) ss 10\Gamma 21:94 erg cm3 s\Gamma 1
   (Eq.17) versus \Lambda (T SXR) ss 10\Gamma 22:18 erg cm3 s\Gamma 1
   (Kano & Tsuneta 1995), while the temperatures differ by a linear factor
   T SXR=T EUV ss 5. This temperature ratio dominates the radiative loss
   time, o/ EUVrad o/ SXRrad ss \Gamma T EUV T SXR \Delta ss 0:2 ; (26)
   yielding a radiative cooling time of o/ SXRrad ss 104 s (or about 3
   hours). The mean physical loop parameters of EUV and SXR loops and the
   resulting time scales are also summarized in Table 3 for convenience.
   From these average physical parameters of our 30 analyzed EIT loops we
   find therefore that the conductive cooling time is at least 2 orders of
   magnitude larger than the radiative cooling time, a result that we have
   already noticed by comparing conductive loss rates versus the radiative
   loss rates in Table 2. This extreme ratio for EUV loops is in marked
   contrast to SXR loops, where the ratio o/ SXRcond =o/ SXRrad = 8 \Theta
   103=104 ss 1 is close to unity according to the mean loop parameters of
   Kano & Tsuneta (1995). This is also consistent with numerical solutions
   of the static energy equation in coronal loops, where the conductive
   energy loss was found to be about twice the radiative loss (e.g.
   Vesecky, Antiochos, & Underwood 1979). Because this theoretical ratio
   does apparently not apply to EUV loops, a possible explanation is that
   EUV loops are not in steady-state condition, but rather in the cooling
   phase far off the equilibrium. We have only limited information on the
   lifetime of the analyzed loops. The fact that stereoscopic correlations
   over time intervals of \Sigma 24 hours clearly show spatial
   displacements of loops (as localized with our dynamic stereoscopy
   method), indicates that the identity of static loop structures is
   generally not warranted over a time interval of 24 hours. It is
   therefore conceivable that the heating function is not co-spatial over
   24 hours, but rather could affect multiple neighboured field lines,
   while individual loop strands could cool off on time scales as short as
   the radiative cooling time (ss 40 minutes). A conceivable scenario is
   quasi-periodic microflare heating as simulated by Peres (1997). - 15 -
   3.4. Loop Scaling Laws Rosner, Tucker & Vaiana (1978) derived a (RTV)
   scaling law between physical loop parameters, i.e. Tmax ss 1:4 \Theta
   103(pL)1=3, under the assumption of a constant pressure p, which
   restricts the application to loops that are essentially smaller than a
   density scale height. Serio et al. (1981) generalized the RTV-law (1)
   for larger loops with a length L0 greater than the pressure scale
   height sp, and (2) for a heating deposition scale height sH , i.e. T ss
   1:4 \Theta 103(p0L0)1=3 exp[\Gamma 0:04L( 2s H + 1 sp )] ; (27) where
   L0 = L=2 corresponds to the half loop length L. Because we find that
   heating has in first order to balance radiative energy loss, and thus
   scales with the half pressure scale height, we can substitute sH ss
   sp=2 in the law of Serio et al. (1981), T ss 1:4 \Theta 103(p0L)1=3
   exp[\Gamma 0:2( Ls p )] : (28) We apply Serio's scaling law to our set
   of 30 loops, using the loop base pressure p0, p0 = p(s = 0) = 2ne0kBT
   EITe ; (29) inferred from the loop lengths L (Table 1), the loop base
   densities ne0 and EIT filter ratio temperatures T EITe (Table 2). A
   scatterplot of the two temperatures is provided in Fig.14. It shows
   that the mean loop temperature predicted by the law of Serio et al.
   (1981), i.e. T Serioe = 1:39 \Sigma 0:30 MK matches closely the mean
   observed EIT temperature T EITe = 1:21 \Sigma 0:06, while the RTV law
   would overestimate the loop temperature by a factor of ss 2 due to the
   breakdown of the constant-pressure assumption. Deviations from the
   RTV-law have also been reported by Kano & Tsuneta (1995) for SXR loops,
   where the temperature bias of Yohkoh/SXT for higher temperatures or
   uncertainties in the loop length determination were suspected to be
   responsible for the discrepancy. In this context we like to emphasize
   that the consideration of the loop pressure decrease p(h) with height,
   as it was done in the generalized law of Serio et al. (1981), was
   sufficient to reconcile the theoretically predicted scaling law
   temperatures with the observed values here. Rosner, Tucker, & Vaiana
   (1978) derive also a scaling law for the base heating energy rate, E0
   ss 105p7=60 L\Gamma 5=60 , under the assumption that the conductive
   flux vanishes at the temperature maximum (assumed to be at the loop
   top). This energy scaling law was also generalized by Serio et al.
   (1981) for large loops with a length L greater than the pressure scale
   height sp, and for a heating deposition scale height sH , E0 ss 105
   p7=60 L\Gamma 5=60 exp[0:5L( 1s H \Gamma 1 sp )] : (30) From our result
   that the heating scale height equals half the pressure scale height, sH
   ss sp=2, we can substitute sH , E0 ss 105 p7=60 L\Gamma 5=60 exp[0:5 Ls
   p ] : (31) Plotting this quantity E0 versus the heating rate EH
   calculated from the energy balance equation (Eq.13), we find that both
   the RTV as well as the Serio energy scaling law roughly matches the
   calculated heating rate. The heating rate is found to have a mean of EH
   = 10\Gamma 3:6\Sigma 0:3 erg cm\Gamma 3 s\Gamma 1, while the RTV
   scaling law yields a mean of ERTV0 = 10\Gamma 3:8\Sigma 0:2 erg
   cm\Gamma 3 s\Gamma 1, and the Serio scaling law a systematically
   smaller mean of ESerio0 = 10\Gamma 2:9\Sigma 0:3 erg cm\Gamma 3 s\Gamma
   1 (Fig.14 right). - 16 - Kano & Tsuneta (1996) derived an energy
   scaling law for loop-top heating, in which the total energy input
   (=conductive and radiative loss) scales as E0 = 4:0 \Theta 103(p0T 1=2m
   )L0 erg cm\Gamma 3 s\Gamma 1 (32) with Tm the maximum temperature at
   the loop top. Setting this maximum loop temperature to Tm = 1:5 MK for
   our 30 loops detected in the EIT 171 *A filter (sensitive in a range of
   Te = 1:0 \Gamma 1:5 MK), we find an equal good agreement of the mean
   energy estimated by this scaling law, EKano0 = 10\Gamma 3:8\Sigma 0:2
   erg cm\Gamma 3 s\Gamma 1 as with the RTV energy scaling law (see
   Fig.14). For comparison with other work (e.g. for parameters of SXR
   loops in Porter & Klimchuk 1995, Klimchuk & Porter 1996), we show
   relationships between heating rates EH, loop lengths L, loop pressures
   p, and magnetic footpoint fields Bfoot for our sample of 30 EUV loops
   in Fig.15. The footpoint field strengths Bfoot have been measured from
   the MDI magnetograms by taking the maximum field values among the
   nearest MDI pixels to the EIT loop footpoints, (see values of Bfoot
   listed in Table 1). Linear regression fits reveal the following
   correlations: p / L\Gamma 0:41\Sigma 0:12 (33) B / L\Gamma 1:02\Sigma
   0:43 (34) EH / L\Gamma 0:73\Sigma 0:23 (35) EH / p1:89\Sigma 0:07 (36)
   We do not find a significant correlation between the loop pressure p
   and the magnetic field B (Fig.15 middle right), or between the heating
   rate EH and the magnetic field B (Fig.15 bottom right). These
   correlations can be used to test functional dependences of the heating
   rate EH(p; L) predicted by theoretical models. For instance, Galeev et
   al. (1981) proposes a magnetic field-related heating model involving
   nonlinear tearing-mode, predicting for steady-state the relation EH /
   p1:2L\Gamma 0:83 (37) which is consistent with Eq.35, but rather
   inconsistent with Eq.36. Another model proposed by Cargill (1993)
   predicts EH / L\Gamma 2, which is not consistent with Eq.35. For models
   where loop heating is accomplished by dissipation of magnetic energy
   (e.g. nanoflare heating model of Parker 1988), one would expect a
   relation EH / B2, which is also not consistent with our findings. A
   wave heating model with resonant Alfv'en waves predicts in quasi-static
   equilibrium a relation (Ofman, Klimchuk, & Davila 1998), EH / n7=5e ss
   p1:4 ; (38) which is not fare from our findings (Eq.36) for EUV loops.
   In heating models with twisted magnetic field lines, a threshold value
   of the magnetic field B is related to the loop length L. This relation
   constitutes a correlation B / Lfi ; (39) which was narrowed down to a
   (90%-confidence) range of \Gamma 1:55 ^ fi ^ \Gamma 0:40 from the
   analysis of SXR loops (Porter & Klimchuk 1995). This value obtained
   from SXR loops is fully consistent with our findings from EUV loops,
   ffi ss \Gamma 1:02 \Sigma 0:42 (Eq. 34). This agreement is expected,
   because this relation is independent of - 17 - loop temperatures, and
   thus should not discriminate between plasma radiating at the cooler EUV
   or hotter SXR temperatures. However, this relation may not apply to
   large-scale magnetic fields that extend beyond dipolar structures, such
   as the global coronal field extending out to the heliosphere, where no
   correlation is found between Bfoot and L (Wang et al. 1997). 3.5. Loop
   Filling Factors So far we assumed a filling factor of unity in our
   derivation of physical loop parameters. However, there is some indirect
   evidence that coronal loops may consist of many unresolved thin strands
   (Golub et al. 1990), suggesting a higher electron density inside the
   strands than obtained from the volume-averaged emission measure across
   a macroscopic loop diameter. If we denote the true density inside the
   strands with n\Lambda e and the volume filling factor of strands by f,
   the two densities relate by n\Lambda e(s) = s EM (s)w z(s) 1 f = ne(s)p
   f : (40) This filling factor affects the radiative loss rate (Eq.16),
   but not the conductive loss rate (Eq.14). Numerical solutions of the
   static energy equation in coronal loops have shown that the conductive
   energy loss to the chromosphere is about twice as much as radiative
   loss in the corona (Vesecky, Antiochos, & Underwood 1979). Based on
   this argument, the filling factor can be derived by equating twice the
   conductive loss rate with the radiative loss rate, 2rFC(s) ss ER(s)
   (Porter & Klimchuk 1995). However, because we found that the radiative
   energy loss surpasses the conductive energy loss by two orders of
   magnitude, the introduction of a filling factor would increase the
   density in loop strands, and thus their radiative energy loss, so that
   there exists no physical solution for filling factors f ^ 1 to equate
   radiative with conductive energy loss. Therefore, our finding of
   dominant radiative loss in EUV loops in the temperature regime of Te =
   1:0 \Gamma 1:5 MK does neither require nor support the hypothesis of a
   filling factor less than unity. A similar conclusion was drawn by
   Cargill & Klimchuk (1997) that the nanoflare heating model cannot
   explain the steady-state of cool loops Te !, 2 MK, because it would
   lead to unphysical filling factors. 3.6. Implications for Coronal
   Heating Theories There are two simple cases that can be discussed for
   the interpretation of our cool EUV loops: (1) either they are just
   cooling off without additional heat input, or (2) the energy loss is
   balanced by heating input, i.e. a steady-state situation. In the first
   case, an immediat prediction would be that the lifetime of the loops is
   just the radiative cooling time (ss 40 minutes), which can only be
   tested by tracking their temporal evolution (which is beyond the scope
   of this paper). In the second case, the energy balance equation (Eq.16)
   can be applied, and some statements can be made about the required
   heating function, which may convey some constraints on theoretical
   heating theories. Since our cool EUV loops were found in hydrostatic
   equilibrium, radiative energy loss is stronger in the denser parts near
   the footpoints than in greater heights. The observed loop segments
   extend roughly over one scale height. The radiative cooling time, which
   scales reciprocally with the density (for a constant temperature),
   o/rad ss n\Gamma 1e (Eq.25), would therefore differ by a factor e ss
   2:7 over a scale height. Based on our average radiative loss time of
   o/rad(s = 0) ss 40 min at the loop base, we expect a longer radiative
   loss time of o/rad(s = *) ss 40 \Theta e ss 110 min at an altitude of
   one scale height. However, if we try to explain the - 18 - observed
   temperature gradient of dT =ds ss 10\Gamma 3 K/m by differences of
   radiative cooling times, for a loop that cools off from a temperature
   of Tmax ? 1:5 MK, the approximate time to produce such a temperature
   gradient dT =ds would be tcool ! o/rad(s = 0) (dT =ds)(T max=*) (1
   \Gamma 1 e ) ; (41) i.e. tcool !, 4 min for our parameters (o/rad(s =
   0) = 40 min, * = 55 Mm). Such a short cooling time would be a far too
   strong constraint on the loop lifetime to explain the frequent
   occurrence of observed EIT loops in this temperature regime. This
   implies that these loops are not just cooling off, but that radiative
   energy loss is balanced to a large fraction by a heating source, i.e.
   the energy balance has to be in near steady-state. It is difficult to
   infer the spatial structure of the heating function. The fact that the
   density profile ne(s) is found to be consistent with hydrostatic
   equilibrium (within the uncertainties resulting from background
   subtraction and loop separation), requires that the heating function
   either adjusts to this barometric density profile, EH(s) / ne(s), which
   is a rather strong constraint, or the heating function redistributes
   quickly along the loop, e.g. with Alfv'enic or electromagnetic wave
   speed. Regardless of the spatial structure inside a particular loop,
   the heating function has to have an efficiency that scales with the
   density squared among different loops, EH / n2e, because our sample of
   loops have almost identical temperatures and scale heights. In all of
   our analyzed cool EUV loops we found that radiative loss exceeds
   conductive energy loss by far, so that the required energy input in a
   steady-state cannot be provided by a heating source near the loop-top
   that supports the radiative energy loss by thermal conduction, an
   argument that was used by Neupert et al. (1998) against the
   heat-deposition model at large heights (e.g. Wheatland, Sturrock, &
   Acton 1997). A consequence of this argument is that thermal conduction
   cannot explain the temperature structure of cool EUV loops at all,
   requiring a nonthermal heating source. Such a nonthermal heating model,
   for instance, is offered by the nanoflare concept (Parker 1988), but
   dominant radiation loss (with a ratio of o/rad=o/cond ss 10\Gamma 2),
   as observed for the EIT loops here, is only possible in the final
   cooling phase of a nanoflare event, according to a model of Cargill
   (1994). In the discussion of heating requirements we neglected mass
   flows, which could play a significant role. Downflows were found from
   Doppler shift measurements at EUV temperatures of Te ss 1 MK that carry
   an energy flux comparable with radiative energy loss (Foukal 1978).
   Upflows with (Doppler-shift) velocities of 50 km s\Gamma 1 have been
   reported in Mg IX and Mg X lines (Te ss 1 MK) in an active region
   recently observed with SoHO/CDS (Brekke et al. 1997). Brown (1996)
   performed hydrodynamic simulations of loops that cool down an initial
   temperature of Te = 2 MK down to temperatures of Te = 0:1 MK, with
   subsequent heating back to the original temperatures of Te = 2 MK (in
   cycles of 3000 s). These simulations demonstrate that downflows with
   velocities of 7-45 km s\Gamma 1 occur during the cooling phase due to
   coronal condensation. From the large number of analytical and numerical
   simulations of (hydrodynamic) loop evolutions in literature, we were
   not able to find cases that reproduce the physical properties of the
   EUV loops observed here: in particular, loops with dominant radiative
   loss in the cooling phase with hydrostatic equilibrium, but having
   longer lifetimes than the radiative cooling time. The closest
   simulations are perhaps those of Brown (1996) with cooling cycles
   between Te = 2 MK and Te = 0:1 MK. Brown (1996) varies the loop half
   length from 7.5 to 50 Mm and finds that the evolution time scale
   increases with loop length, from 10 minutes for loops with a length
   around 10 Mm to well over 30 minutes for loops with lengths of 50 Mm.
   Although the largest loops simulated by Brown (1996) still fall short
   of the average length (L = 433 \Sigma 136 Mm) of EUV loops observed
   here, his conclusion that larger loops tend to have their evolution
   paths closer - 19 - to the static equilibrium path is likely to apply
   to our large-scale EUV loops, which were all found in hydrostatic
   equilibrium. 4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS We developed a 3D-analysis
   method designed to determine geometric and physical parameters of loop
   structures in solar EUV or SXR images. This method, called Dynamic
   Stereoscopy, makes use of stereoscopic correlations of dynamically
   evolving loop structures that can be traced from high-pass filtered
   images. The method is designed to separate closely-spaced, nested
   loops, in the plane of the sky as well as along the line-of-sight, by
   suitable background subtraction. With this method we analyzed SoHO/EIT
   171 *A observations of active region AR 7986, obtained on 1996 Aug 30.
   We traced 30 loop segments of this active region and determined the 3D
   cartesian space coordinates [x(s); y(s); z(s)], the loop widths w(s),
   the electron density ne(s), and the electron temperature Te(s) as
   function of the loop length s. The vertical density scale height * of
   these loops was properly corrected for the inclination angle # of the
   loop plane to the vertical, and the column depth wz(s) of loops was
   corrected for the projection angle (s) between the loop axis and the
   line-of-sight, which enters the conversion of emission measures EM (s)
   into electron densities ne(s). From potential field lines neighboured
   to the selected EUV loops we estimated also the magnetic field B(h),
   the plasma-fi parameter fi(h), and the Alfv'en velocity vA(h) along the
   loops. The physical parameters obtained with this stereoscopic
   3D-method have therefore an unprecedented accuracy. The statistical
   results of geometric and physical parameters of the analyzed 30 EUV

   findings and conclusions of this analysis are: 1. The analyzed cool EUV
   loops are in hydrostatic equilibrium, i.e. the mean scale height
   temperature is identical to the filter-ratio temperature, T *e ss T
   EITe , and the density profile ne(h) is nearly exponential. The high
   accuracy of this result could only be accomplished by proper
   reconstruction of the 3D loop geometry, in particular by the
   stereoscopic measurement of the inclination angle # of the loop planes.
   2. The loop width w(s) is found to be almost constant for most of the
   analyzed loops. Only 4 out 30 loops show a significant divergence with
   height, as it is expected for dipolar fields. The constant thickness of
   EUV loops indicates the presence of current-induced non-potential
   magnetic fields (Wang & Sakurai 1998), consistent with the findings
   from SXR loops (Klimchuk et al. 1992). 3. The conductive loss rate rFC
   is found to be about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the radiative
   loss rate ER for these cool EUV loops, a fact that is in marked
   difference to hot SXR loops, where both loss rates are comparable, rFC
   ss ER. The dominance of radiative cooling over conductive cooling is
   mainly an effect of the cooler temperature of EUV loops. As a
   consequence, the heating rate has to balance mainly the radiative loss
   in steady-state, implying that the heating rate scales - 21 - with the
   squared density, EH / n2e, and that the heating scale height sH
   corresponds to the half density scale height *, sH = *=2. 4. The
   temperature scaling law of RTV fails for these cool EUV loops, because
   the constant-pressure assumption breaks down due to their large height
   extent over several scale heights, but the generalized temperature
   scaling law of Serio et al. is found to be consistent with the data.
   The energy scaling laws of RTV, Serio et al., and Kano & Tsuneta all
   match the data reasonably well. Furthermore, we find the following
   scaling laws with loop length L and loop pressure p:\Gamma p / L\Gamma
   0:41\Sigma 0:12\Gamma B / L\Gamma 1:02\Sigma 0:43\Gamma EH / L\Gamma
   0:73\Sigma 0:23\Gamma EH / p1:89\Sigma 0:07 5. The relatively short
   radiative cooling time (ss 40 min) with respect to the used
   stereoscopic time intervals (\Sigma 1 days) suggests that radiative
   loss is supported by a near steady-state energy input. Coronal heating
   models with a dependence EH / n2e are favored. Heating models with
   downward conduction of heat input from a large height are not
   consistent with the density and temperature structure of these cool EUV
   loops. 6. The potential magnetic field is found to convey a fair
   representation of the coronal magnetic field traced out by EIT loops.
   The ratio of the thermal to the magnetic pressure is found to be always
   fi ?, 1 up to the apexes of the EIT loops, garantueing magnetic
   confinement in all parts of the EUV loops. The Alfv'en velocity is
   found to be highest near the loop footpoints, and reaches
   asymptotically values in the range of vA ss 500 \Gamma 1000 km s\Gamma
   1 in the upper parts of the loops. In future work we will analyze the
   hotter loops Te ?, 1:5 MK of this active region with stereoscopic
   methods. A further goal is to investigate the time variability of cool
   and hot active region loops, their steady-state phases and transitions
   to non-equilibrium states. Acknowledgments: We thank Dr. Stephen White

   (APPENDIX) Heliographic Coordinate Systems and Transformations For
   analysis of observed images, for time-dependent coordinate
   transformations that take the solar rotation into account (as needed in
   stereoscopic correlations), and for convenient definitions of loop
   geometries we define 3 different coordinate systems: Image Coordinate
   System (x,y,z): The (x; y) coordinates refer to the x-axis and y-axis
   of an observed image, while the coordinate (z) is orthogonal to the
   image, or parallel to the line-of-sight direction, defined positive
   toward the observer. The origin (x; y; z) = (0; 0; 0) of this
   coordinate system is most conveniently assumed at the Sun center
   position. A solar FITS image should contain the position of the Sun
   center in pixel units (ix0; jy0) (in FITS header CRPIX1, CRPIX2 or E
   XCEN, E YCEN), the pixel size (\Delta x; \Delta y) - 22 - in units or
   arcseconds (in FITS header CDELT1, CDELT2), and the solar radius ir0 in
   pixel units (in FITS header SOLAR R, or E XSMD, E YSMD if the
   semi-diameters of an ellipse are fitted). With this information, a
   pixel position (i; j) can then be converted into the coordinate system
   (x; y) by xi = \Delta x (i \Gamma ix0) (A1) yi = \Delta y (j \Gamma
   jx0) ; (A2) where \Delta x=arcseconds/pixel for (x; y) in units of
   arcseconds, or \Delta x = Rfi=ir0, with Rfi = 696; 000 km, if physical
   length units (km) are preferred. Heliographic Coordinate System
   (l,b,r): The heliographic coordinate system is co-rotating with the
   solar surface. A position on the solar surface is generally specified
   by heliographic longitude and latitude coordinates (l; b) (in units of
   heliographic degrees), with reference to the Carrington rotation grid.
   The heliographic longitude and latitude [l0(t); b0(t)] of the Sun
   center and the position angle P (t) of the solar rotation axis for a
   given time t are published in The Astronomical Almanac (Nautical
   Almanac Office, NRL, Washington DC). The 2-dimensional spherical
   coordinate system (l; b) can be generalized into a 3-dimensional
   coordinate system by incorporating the height h above the solar
   surface, which can be expressed as a dimensionless distance to the Sun
   center (in units of solar radii), r = (1 + hRfi ) : (A3) The
   transformation from the 3D heliographic coordinate system (l; b; r)
   into image coordinates (x; y; z) can be accomplished by applying a
   series of 4 rotations to the (normalized) vector (0; 0; r) (see also
   Loughhead, Wang, & Blows 1983),0 @ x=Rfi y=Rfi z=Rfi 1A = 0@ cos(P +
   P0) \Gamma sin(P + P0) 0 sin(P + P0) cos(P + P0) 0 0 0 1 1A 0@ 1 0 0 0
   cos(b0) \Gamma sin(b0) 0 sin(b0) cos(b0) 1A 0@ cos(l 0 \Gamma l) 0

   1 0 0 0 cos(\Gamma b) \Gamma sin(\Gamma b) 0 sin(\Gamma b) cos(\Gamma
   b) 1A 0@ 0 0 r 1A ; (A4) where (l0; b0) are the heliographic longitude
   and latitude of the Sun center, P is the position angle of the solar
   rotation axis with respect to the North-South direction (defined
   positive towards East), and P0 is the image rotation (roll) angle with
   respect to the North-South direction, (P + P0 = 0 for images rotated to
   solar North). In stereoscopic correlations, only the longitude of the
   Sun center, l0(t), is time-dependent in first order (according to the
   solar rotation rate), while b0(t) and P (t) are slowly-varying, and
   thus almost constant for short time intervals. Loop Plane Coordinate
   System (X,Y,Z): To parametrize coronal loops it is also convenient to
   introduce a cartesian system that is aligned with the loop footpoint
   baseline (X-axis) and coincides with the loop plane (X\Gamma Z plane, Y
   = 0). For instance, a circular loop model defined in the X\Gamma Z
   plane is specified in Eqs.7-8. The transformation of loop coordinates
   (X; Y = 0; Z) into cartesian coordinate system (X0; Y 0; Z0) that is
   aligned with the heliographic coordinate system (l; b; r) can simply be
   accomplished with help of two rotations, 0@ X0 Y 0 Z0 1A = 0@ cos(ff)
   \Gamma sin(ff) 0 sin(ff) cos(ff) 0 0 0 1 1A 0@ 1 0 0 0 cos(#) sin(#) 0
   \Gamma sin(#) cos(#) 1A 0@ X Y Z 1A ; (A5) - 23 - where the azimuth
   angle ff denotes the angle between the loop footpoint baseline and the
   East-West direction, and # represents the inclination or tilt angle
   between the loop plane and the vertical to the solar surface (Fig.2).
   Placing the origin of the loop coordinate system [X = 0; Y = 0; Z = 0]
   (which is also the origin of the rotated coordinate system [X0 = 0; Y 0
   = 0; Z0 = 0] at heliographic position (l1; b1) at an altitude hFoot
   above the solar surface, the transformation into heliographic
   coordinates is then given by0 @ l b r 1A = 0@ l1 + arctan[X0=(Z0 +
   hFoot + Rfi)] b1 + arctan[Y 0=(Z0 + hFoot + Rfi)]p [X02 + Y 02 + (Z0 +
   hFoot + Rfi)2]=Rfi 1A : (A6) B. (APPENDIX) Line-of-Sight Correction on
   Loop Column Depth Column depth of loops with constant cross-section: In
   order to convert observed emission measures EM (x; y) = R n2e(x; y;
   z)dz into local electron densities ne(x; y; z) we need information on
   the column depthR dz. An approximation that is often useful are coronal
   loops with a constant cross-section w, which can be measured from the
   FWHM as it appears perpendicular to the line-of-sight in the plane of
   the sky. For 3-dimensional models of loops parametrized by coordinates
   (xi; yi; zi), the angle between the line-of-sight and a loop segment
   can then directly be derived by the ratio of the projected to the
   effective length of a loop segment [i; i + 1]. cos([xi; yi; zi]) =

   Fe IX/X image of active region AR 7986, recorded on 1996-Aug-30,
   0020:14 UT, at a wavelength of 171 *A, sensitive in the temperature
   range of Te = 1:0 \Gamma 1:5 MK (top). The greyscales of the image is
   scaled logarithmically in flux, the contours correspond to increments
   of 100 DN (data numbers). The heliographic grid has a spacing of 50.
   The filtered image (lower panel) was created by subtracting a smoothed
   image (using a boxcar of 3\Theta 3 pixels) from the original image, in
   order to enhance the loop fine structure. Fig. 2.-- Definition of loop
   parameters: loop point positions (xi; yi); i = 1; :::; n starting at
   the primary footpoint at height h1 = hfoot, the azimuth angle ff
   between the loop footpoint baseline and heliographic East-West
   direction, and the inclination angle # between the loop plane and the
   vertical to the solar surface. Fig. 3.-- The principle of Dynamic
   Stereoscopy is illustrated here with an example of two adjacent loops,
   where a thicker loop is bright at time t1, while a thinner loop is
   brightest at time t2. From the loop positions (xi; yi) measured at an
   intermediate reference time t, i.e. t1 ! t ! t2 (middle panel in middle
   row), projections are calculated for the previous and following days
   for different inclination angles # of the loop plane (left and right
   panel in middle row). By extracting stripes parallel to the calculated
   projections # = 100; 200; 303 (panels in bottom part) it can be seen
   that both loops appear only coaligned with the stripe axis for the
   correct projection angle # = 200, regardless of the footpoint
   displacement \Delta x between the two loops. The coalignment criterion
   can therefore be used to constrain the correct inclination angle #,
   even for dynamically changing loops. Fig. 4.-- Projections of 30
   stereoscopically reconstructed loop segments (numbered white curves)
   are shown overlaid on the SoHO/EIT 171 *A images (top panels) and the
   filtered images (bottom panels) of 1998-Aug-29, 30, and 31. The 30 loop
   segments were traced from the filter image of Aug 30 (bottom middle
   panel), while the projections on the previous and following day were
   calculated from the inclination angles # obtained from the dynamic
   stereoscopy method. Note that the overall magnetic field structure is
   almost invariant during the 3 days, but dynamic changes of the loops
   produce slight displacements between the calculated projections forward
   and backward in time and the actually observed fine structure. Fig.
   5.-- Three different projections of the stereoscopically reconstructed
   30 loops of AR 7986 are shown. The loop segments that were traced from
   the 96-Aug-30 171 *A image are marked with thick solid lines, while the
   extrapolated segments (marked with thin solid lines) represent circular
   geometries extrapolated from the traced segments. The three views are:
   (1) as observed from Earth with l0; b0 (bottom right panel), (2)
   rotated to North by b00 = b0 \Gamma 1000 (top right panel), and (3)
   rotated to East by l00 = l0 +97:20 (corresponding to -7.2 days of solar
   rotation; bottom left panel). An EIT 171 *A image observed at the same
   time (-7.2 days earlier) is shown for comparison (top left panel),
   illustrating a similar range of inclination angles and loop heights as
   found from stereoscopic correlations a week later. The heliographic
   grid has a spacing of 50 degrees or 60 Mm. - 31 - Fig. 6.-- The
   positions of the curved coordinate grids of the 30 analyzed loop
   segments are shown in the top right panel, which has the same
   orientation as the 1996-Aug-30 map shown in Fig.4 (middle). The
   coordinate grid of loop #1 is represented with 1-pixel resolution,
   while only the outer borders and central axes are indicated for the
   other loop segments. - The vertically oriented panels represent the
   coordinate grids of the analyzed 30 loops, stretched out along the loop
   axis. The top of the panels corresponds to the primary footpoint (see
   positions l1; b1 in Table 1). In each panel we show the EIT 171 *A flux
   loop cross-sections measured perpendicularly to the loop axes.
   Successive cross-sections are separated by a distance of 1 pixel along
   the loop axis. The flux associated with each loop is marked with a grey
   area, obtained by background subtraction with a cubic spline
   interpolation between both sides of the loop cross-section. Fig. 7.--
   The loop-associated EUV flux (Floop(s), thick line), the total EUV flux
   (Ftotal(s), thin line), and the background (Ftotal(s) \Gamma Fflux(s),
   dotted line) measured along the loop is shown for Loop #1 (left panel).
   A histogram of the relative fractions Floop=Ftotal (integrated over the
   traced loop lengths) is shown from all 30 analyzed loops in right
   panel. Fig. 8.-- The variation of the loop thickness is shown for the
   10 loops with the least confusion by adjacent loops (see cross-sections
   in Fig.6) as function of the loop length s (left panels). A linear
   regression fit is indicated (solid line in left panels). The average
   (equivalent) width w is histogrammed for all 30 analyzed loops (top
   right). A loop divergence factor is calculated from the ratio of the
   average width in the upper half and lower half (traced) loop segments
   (right bottom). Note that most of the loops show no significant loop
   thickness variation. Fig. 9.-- Left panel: The effect of the variable
   column depth wz(s) measured parallel to the line-of-sight z is
   illustrated as function of the loop length parameter s, for a loop with
   a constant diameter w. Right panel: The effect of the inclination angle
   # of the loop plane on the inferred density scale height *(#) is shown.
   Both effects have to be accounted for the determination of the electron
   density ne(s) along the loop. Fig. 10.-- The electron density ne(s)
   (left panels) and the EIT filter-ratio electron temperature Te(s)
   (right panels) as function of the loop length s for the same 10 loops
   selected in Fig.8. An exponential model ne(h) is fitted, yielding the
   density scale height * and scale height temperature T *e indicated in
   the left panels. The average EIT filter-ratio temperature T EITe
   (obtained from 171/195 *A images) is indicated in the right panels. A
   temperature gradient dTe=ds is listed if the gradient is significant.

   panel), EIT filter-ratio temperatures T EITe (left bottom panel),
   scatter plot of these two temperatures (right top panel), and EIT
   temperature gradients dT =ds (right bottom panel) for all analyzed 30
   loops. Fig. 12.-- SoHO/MDI Magnetogram recorded on 96-Aug-30, 2048 UT,
   rotated to the time of the analyzed EIT image (96-Aug-30 0020:14 UT),
   with contour levels at B = \Gamma 1050; :::; \Gamma 150; \Gamma 50; 50;
   150; ::::; 1050 G. Magnetic field lines calculated from a potential
   field model are overlaid (thin lines) onto the 30 loops (thick lines)
   traced from the SoHO/EIT image. - 32 - Fig. 13.-- The magnetic field
   B(h) (top), the plasma fi-parameter or ratio of thermal to magnetic
   pressure, fi(h) (middle), and the Alfv'en velocity vA(h) (bottom)
   determined as function of height h h for the 30 analyzed EIT loops. The
   magnetic field B(h) is taken from the nearest potential field line (see
   Fig.12). The vertical density scale height * = 55 Mm is marked with a
   dotted line. A potential field model is indicated with dashed curves
   (top). Fig. 14.-- Test of loop scaling laws for our sample of 30 EIT
   loops. The loop temperature predicted by the RTV-law (diamonds) and the
   scaling law of Serio et al. (1981), see Eq.22 in text, (triangles), are
   shown. Note that the scaling law of Serio et al. predicts the correct
   mean loop temperature compared with the observed EIT temperatures (thin
   line). Fig. 15.-- Scaling laws between the steady-state heating rate
   EH, loop pressure p, loop length L, and magnetic field strength Bfoot
   for our sample of 30 EUV loops. Linear regression fits are indicated
   with solid lines, the standard deviations of the slopes are marked with
   dashed lines. - 33 - -0.05 0.00 0.05 -0.16 -0.14 -0.12 -0.10 -0.08
