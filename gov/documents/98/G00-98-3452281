                      Research and Monitoring Projects

   There have been, and continue to be, a variety of research projects on
   the Flower Garden Banks and Stetson Bank.  The isolated nature of the
   banks, coupled with the unique climatic conditions assoicated with
   their geographic location, makes these areas ideal for research.   The
   following links lead to more detailed descriptions of current and past
   research within the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary.  If
   more information is desired, please contact the individuals indicated
   on the following pages, or the research coordinator for the Sanctuary.

   Cleaning Behavior - Dr. Mary Wicksten provides a detailed description
   of cleaning behaviors on the Flower Garden Banks and Stetson Bank.

   Coral/Dinoflagellete Symbioses - Jay Reichman describes his
   investigations into the symbiosis between coral polyps and the
   microalgae they house.

   Elasmobranch Research - Jeff Childs describes his research on
   elsamobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays) in the Gulf of Mexico.

   Sanctuary Reef Fish - Dr. Christy Semmens details her work with the
   reef fish communities of the three banks in the Sanctuary, and provides
   a list of species known to occur on these banks.

   Macroalgal Primary Production - Harlon (Lanny) Miller and Ken Dutton
   describe their research into the macroalgal production in the
   Sanctuary. Relatively low nutrient loads on the banks due to the
   distance from the coast provide potential baselines from which
   scientists can determine the impact of elevated nutrients on coral
   reefs world wide.

   Coral Reproduction - Derek Hagman describes his research on coral
   reproduction.  The Flower Garden Banks are valuable for this type of
   research because the annual mass spawning event that occurs throughout
   the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico seems to be most prolific at the
   Flower Gardens.

   Turtle Research - Emma Hickerson, research coordinator for the
   Sanctuary, describes her research on the sea turtles that use and
   inhabit the Flower Garden Banks and Stetson Bank.

   Monitoring - In addition to the above named research projects, the
   Sanctuary conducts annual monitoring cruises.  Benthic monitoring on
   the banks is conducted to monitor changes over time, and to establish a
   baseline in the event that a catastrophic event takes place (ship
   grounding, heavy oil spill, etc...).   Sport divers can also
   participate in monitoring the reef fishes of the banks.
