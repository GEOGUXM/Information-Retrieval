              Nonindigenous Crustacean Distribution Information
     __________________________________________________________________

   Crustaceans (Phylum Arthropoda, Class Crustacea) are found in marine,
   brackish and fresh waters. Common methods of introduction include
   ballast water discharge, intentional release as forage for sport fish,
   and accidental release from aquaculture facilities. Potential impacts
   include competition with, and predation on, native species. The opossum
   shrimp, Mysis relicta, was first introduced into Kootenay Lake, British
   Columbia, in 1949 and was widely stocked as a forage food for sport
   fish in the West. It is an opportunistic feeder with both predatorial
   and filter feeding habits. Dramatic changes in native zooplankton
   communities, including species extinctions, have been observed after
   opossum shrimp were introduced. After the introduction of the opossum
   shrimp into Flathead Lake, Montana, Daphnia longiremis and Leptodora
   kindti were reduced to undetectable levels while Diaptomus ashlandi
   declined more than 75% from previous levels.
