                     WINGS/AFSS Pilot Visitation Program

   REFERENCE: Advisory Circular AC 61-91H, Pilot Proficiency Award Program

   The Dayton AFSS, in conjunction with the Cincinnati and Columbus Flight
   Standards District Offices, has developed a WINGS program, whereby
   pilots can receive WINGS credits upon completion of a facility
   familiarization of the Dayton AFSS. Upon completion of the facility
   familiarization and the required 3 hours of flying as specified in AC
   61-91H, pilots will be awarded an appropriate level WINGS lapel/tie pin
   and a certificate of completion.

   The program will provide pilots with an opportunity to sit down with a
   specialist as they perform their Preflight, Broadcast, Inflight, and
   Flight Data duties. In general, the specialist hosting a pilot will
   provide the pilot with an overall view of the Dayton AFSS equipment and
   function. More specifically, the specialist will provide an overview of
   the operating position and duties, answer questions and allow the pilot
   to listen in as the specialist performs their duties. Some additional
   suggested topics for discussion could include TIBS/HIWAS broadcast,
   briefing techniques, and frequency congestion.

   It is hoped that this program will give pilots a better understanding
   of our job functions and how we can serve their needs. If you would
   like to participate or if you have any questions regarding this
   program, please call one of our supervisors at 937-454-8398.
