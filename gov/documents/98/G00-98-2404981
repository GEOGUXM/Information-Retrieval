   Educational Attainment of Foster Youth: Achievement and Graduation
   Outcomes for Children in State Care (#01-11-3901)

   Over 12,000 school-age children in Washington State lived in foster
   care sometime during the past 12 months because of abuse, neglect,
   abandonment, or family conflict.  While the health and safety of these
   children are of primary concern, the educational attainment of foster
   children will also greatly impact their ability to succeed as adults.
   This study finds that at both the elementary and secondary levels, the
   educational attainment foster students in Washington falls
   significantly behind other students.  Furthermore, foster students are
   likely to experience additional risk factors related to poor school
   outcomes.  As directed by the Legislature, this study also suggests
   alternatives for sharing information about the educational experiences
   of foster students.   [Mason Burley and Mina Halpern - November 2001]

   Long-Term Foster Care in Washington: Children's Status and Placement
   Decision-Making (#01-06-3901)

   The 2000 Legislature directed the Washington State Institute for Public
   Policy (Institute) to compare placement decisions and funding
   methodologies for residential care services for children in long-term
   foster care and to examine the best practices in other states (EHB
   2487).  This report finds that initial placement decisions that
   correspond to the level of difficulties faced by a foster child and
   ongoing supports appropriate to the needs of the foster family are two
   steps that may improve the continuity of foster care placements and
   lead to positive outcomes for youth in foster care.  [Lucy Berliner and
   David Fine - June 2001]

   Placement Decisions for Children in Long-Term Foster Care:  Innovative
   Practices and Literature Review (#01-02-3902)

   The 2000 Legislature directed the Washington State Institute for Public
   Policy (Institute) to examine best practices in other states regarding
   placement decisions for children in long-term foster care (EHB 2487
   ยง607 (5)).  The following topics are covered in this report:  1)
   Placement decision-making;   2) Research findings of children in foster
   care; and 3) Innovative practices in other states.  A forthcoming
   report will describe the characteristics of Washingtons children in
   long-term foster care and their placement history.  [Lee Doran and Lucy
   Berliner - February 2001]

   Encouraging Adoption of Children in Foster Care:  Trends in
   Washington's Financial Assistance Program (#01-02-3903)

   Washington States Adoption Support Program encourages families to adopt
   children from the child welfare system who, because of age, race,
   physical condition, or emotional health, are considered difficult to
   place.  The program was established by the 1971 Legislature and is
   intended to remove financial barriers to adoption.  Adoption assistance
   includes help with legal costs, fees for adoption, ongoing monthly
   maintenance for adopted children with special needs, medical coverage,
   counseling reimbursements, and training opportunities for adoptive
   parents.  The 2000 Legislature directed the Washington State Institute
   for Public Policy (Institute) to review the Adoption Support Program
   (EHB 2487 ยง607 (5)).  [Lee Doran and Lucy Berliner - February 2001]
