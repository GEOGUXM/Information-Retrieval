NIDA Web Privacy Notice
     __________________________________________________________________

   Thank you for visiting the National Institute on Drug Abuse Website and
   reviewing our Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy for visits to
   www.nida.nih.gov, www.drugabuse.gov, www.clubdrugs.org,
   www.sarasquest.org, www.steroidabuse.org, stopdrugaddiction.org is
   clear:

     We collect no information about you, other than information
     automatically collected and stored (see below), when you visit our
     web site unless you choose to provide that information to us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Information Collected and Stored Automatically

   When you browse through any web site, certain personal information
   about you can be collected. We automatically collect and temporarily
   store the following information about your visit:

     * The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a
       private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect
       from a university's domain), and IP address (an IP address is a
       number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
       are surfing the Web) from which you access our website
     * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site,
     * The date and time you access our site,
     * The pages you visit, and
     * If you linked to our website from another website, the address of
       that website.

   We use this information for statistical purposes and to help us make
   our site more useful to visitors. Unless it is specifically stated
   otherwise, no additional information will be collected about you.

   Personally Provided Information:

   You do not have to give us personal information to visit our web sites.

   If you choose to provide us with additional information about yourself
   through an e-mail message, form, survey, etc., we will only maintain
   the information as long as needed to respond to your question or to
   fulfill the stated purpose of the communication.

   However, all communications addressed to Information@lists.nida.nih.gov
   or the Webmaster are maintained, as required by law, for historical
   purposes. These communications are archived on a monthly basis, but are
   also protected by the Privacy Act which restricts our use of them, yet
   permits certain disclosures.

   Disclosure:

   NIDA does not disclose, give, sell or transfer any personal information
   about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement or statute.

   Intrusion Detection:

   This site is maintained by the U.S. Government. It is protected by
   various provisions of Title 18, U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18 are
   subject to criminal prosecution in federal court.

   For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
   available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor traffic
   to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or
   otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement
   investigations, and pursuant to any required legal process, information
   from these sources may be used to help identify an individual.

   Systems of Records:

   Information originally collected in traditional paper systems can be
   submitted electronically, i.e., electronic commerce transactions and
   information updates about eligibility benefits. Electronically
   submitted information is maintained and destroyed pursuant to the
   Federal Records Act, and in some cases may be subject to the Privacy
   Act. If information that you submit is to be used in a Privacy Act
   system of records, there will be a Privacy Act Notice provided.

   Security:

   Information collected online in the form of server logs, form
   submissions or e-mail to Information@lists.nida.nih.gov are stored
   securely and have limited access by NIDA staff. Archival data is stored
   offline in a secured storage facility.

   Cookies:

   A "cookie" is a small file that a Web site transfers to your computer's
   hard disk allowing our server to "remember" specific information about
   your session while you are connected.

   The NIDA web site does not make use of cookies, or permit other parties
   to use our server to host their cookies in order to collect information
   from our visitors. The Publication Catalog makes use of "session
   cookies" that keep your place when requesting more information than can
   be received on one page. These cookies are not stored on your system
   and are deleted at the end of each session. The NIDA site does not use
   or allow the use of any other systems (invisible graphics for example)
   to allow other parties to monitor and track visitors to the NIDA web
   site.
