   USGS Finds West Nile Virus in Missouri, Arkansas

   **Note: The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services can be
   reached at 573-751-6113 on Friday or 573-751-6400 over the weekend and
   the Columbus Day holiday on Monday.**

   Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Madison, Wisc.,
   confirmed today that five dead crows found in the St. Louis, Mo., area
   tested positive for the West Nile Virus. On Thursday, USGS biologists
   announced that a dead blue jay, found near El Dorado, Ark., also tested
   positive for the virus. These most recent cases mark the furthest west
   the virus has been identified in the United States.

   One year ago, USGS scientists said the West Nile Virus was on the move
   south and possibly west. The virus, considered a special threat to
   crows and jays, has appeared this year from Florida to Maine and now
   crossed the Mississippi River. "This year has seen a rapid westward
   expansion of the virus," said Scott Wright, a wildlife disease
   pathologist at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center where the tests
   were performed. "We had expected some expansion to the west, but we
   could not have predicted how fast the virus would move. As the weather
   begins to cool though, we should see the virus activity slow down in
   northern parts of the country."

   Primarily a wild bird disease, West Nile Virus has been confirmed in 25
   humans in 2001, including an Atlanta woman who died. It has been found
   in more than 80 bird species and 9 mammal species since its arrival in
   this country in 1999. This summer, the virus has also been identified
   in 137 horses in Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,
   Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and
   Virginia and in thousands of birds in eastern states.

   A USGS West Nile Virus website with additional information is available
   at: http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/research/west_nile/west_nile.html.

   This year, the virus has been identified in 27 states, the District of
   Columbia and in Ontario, Canada.
