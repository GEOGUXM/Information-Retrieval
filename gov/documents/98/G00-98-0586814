CD Answer Trouble Shooting Guide from Dataware

   CAUTION: Always backup the config.sys and autoexec.bat files before
   editing them. Call Dataware Customer Support at 617-577-2844 if you
   have any questions about the installation process.
    1. Did CD Answer finish installation?
          + If it finished installing, skip to 2.
          + If it did not finish, at what point in the installation did it
            fail? What was the error message you received?
            Contact Dataware Customer Support at 617-577-2844
    2. Are you able to start CD Answer?
          + If you could start CD Answer, skip to 3.
          + If you could not start CD Answer, are you trying to run CD
            Answer from a network workstation?
          + If you are not on a network workstation, skip to 3.
          + If you are on a network workstation, is CD Answer installed on
            the workstation or on the server?
          + If CD Answer is installed on the workstation and the CD-ROM
            resides on the workstation what is the error message you
            receive? Call Dataware Customer Support at 617-577-2844.
          + IF CD Answer is installed on the workstation and the CD ROM
            resides on the server, make sure the CD-ROM drive is mapped to
            the workstation.
          + If the CD Answer is installed on the server, the CD-ROM must
            also reside on the server, or on a network CD-ROM drive (such
            as CD-Net or Opti_net), to which the server has a drive letter
            mapped. And in order for workstations to be able to run CD
            Answer, the full path to the CD Answer executable file,
            dw.exe, must be flagged as read/write/sharable on the server.
            In addition, the CD Answer configuration file, _dw_.cfg, must
            also be read/write/shareable. If these things are done and you
            can't start CD Answer, what is the error message you receive?
            Call Dataware Customer Support at 617-577-2844.
    3. Is CD Answer able to read from the CD?
          + If CD Answer can read from the CD, but you cannot run CD
            Answer, please note exactly any error messages that you
            receive, and call Dataware Customer Support at 617-577-2844.
          + If CD Answer cannot read from the CD, did you choose to use a
            CD-ROM driver or a CD-ROM drive letter while you were going
            through the installation?
          + If you chose to use a CD-ROM driver name and are running
            Windows 95 or Window NT 4.0, you may not have config.sys and
            autoexec.bat files. CD Answer relies on getting it's
            information about a CD-ROM driver from these files. You can
            fix this problem by using a CD-ROM drive letter in place of
            the CD-ROM driver name. This will have no affect on CD
            Answer's performance or ability to read the CD-ROM drive,
            unless your CD-ROM drive letter changes (due to addition of
            network drive, protable drives, etc.). You can replace your
            CD-ROM driver name in one of two ways:
            Go through the installation program again, this time when you
            are prompted to choose whether to use a driver name or drive
            letter, make sure that the drive letter that appears in the
            heading above the options is your CD-ROM drive letter, and
            select option that allows you to use a drive letter. If the
            drive letter in the heading above the options is not your
            CD-ROM drive letter, or if you wish to use a different CD-ROM
            drive than the one listed in the heading, select the option
            that allows you to use another drive letter, enter the drive
            letter of your CD-ROM drive in the box to the right of the
            words "Database Location", and proceed with the installation.
            Open the directory that CD Answer was installed to and look
            for a file called _dw_.cfg. This is the CD Answer
            configuration file. It is a text file that can be edited using
            MS_DOS edit or Windows Notepad. Open this file and look for
            the line that says Driver =" ". In between the quotes you will
            probably see something like "FS_MSCDX=MSCDEX00" or
            "FS_ISGEN=MSCDEX00". MSCDEX00 is the false driver name that is
            used by Windows 95/NT 4.0 in place of the standard driver name
            that would be loaded in the config.sys and autoexec.bat files.
            Simply delete the text between the quotations marks and
            substitute your CD-ROM drive letter. The final line should
            look similar to Driver = "D:\", where D:\ is your CD-ROM drive
            letter. Close the file, making sure to save it.
    4. If you chose to use a CD-ROM driver name and you are running MS_DOS
       or Window 3.x, check your config.sys file. You can find it on the
       root directory of your hard drive. It is an editable text file that
       you can open with MS-DOS edit or Windows Notepad. Look for a line
       similar to DEVICE=C:\TEAC\TEAC_CDI.SYS /D:TEAC_CDI. This line loads
       your CD-ROM driver (TEAC_CDI.SYS) into the computer's memory, and
       assigns it a driver name (in this case, TEAC_CDI). Now check your
       autoexec.bat file. Similarly, it is a text editable file and will
       also be located in the root directory of your hard drive. Look for
       a line similar to C:\TEAC\MSCDEX.EXE /D:TEAC_CDI. This line runs
       the Microsoft CD-ROM extensions (MSCDEX) on your CD-ROM dirver (the
       device driver that was loaded in your config.sys file, and is
       represented by the driver name TEAC_CDI), and will assign your
       CD-ROM drive the next available drive letter.
       If either of these lines (or something similar to them) does not
       appear in your config.sys and autoexec.bat files, your CD-ROM drive
       is probably not loaded on your computer, and CD Answer will not be
       able to read from your CD-ROMs. If you have a driver disc that came
       with your CD-ROM drive, attempt to run the installation from the
       disc. If this does not work, contact the manufacturer of your
       CD-ROM drive to find out how to correctly install your CD-ROM
       drivers.
       If these lines do appear, and are correct, and your CD-ROM drive is
       loaded, note the CD-ROM driver name assigned to the CD-ROM driver
       in your config.sys file (in the example, TEAC_CDI). Did this CD-ROM
       driver name appear in the heading above the options as the CD-ROM
       device during the installation process? If you do not know or
       cannot remember, you can find out in one of two ways:
       Go though the installation program again, this time when you are
       prompted to choose whether to use a driver name or drive letter,
       look at the heading above the options. Does the CD-ROM driver name
       that appears in your config.sys file match what is in the heading
       as the CD-ROM device? If not, select the option that allows you to
       use another CD-ROM driver; in the next screen, select the option
       that allows you to enter your CD-ROM device manually; enter your
       CD-ROM driver name in the box to the right of the words CD-ROM
       Device Name; and then proceed with the installation.
       Open the directory that CD Answer was installed to and look for the
       file called _dw_.cfg. This is the CD Answer configuration file. It
       is a text file that can be edited using MS-DOS edit or Windows
       Notepad. Open this file and look for the line that says Driver = "
       ". In between the quotes you will probably see something like
       "FS_MSCDX=TEAC_CDI" or "FS_ISGEN=TEAC_CDI". Does the CD-ROM driver
       name that appears in your config.sys file match what is on the
       right hand side of the equals sign in the quotation marks? If not,
       change the driver name on the right hand side of the equals sign to
       match your CD-ROM driver name. Close the file, making sure to save
       it.
    5. If you chose to use a CD-ROM drive letter, when you were prompted
       to choose whether to use a CD-ROM driver or a drive letter, was the
       drive letter that appeared in the heading above the options the
       same as the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive, and did you select
       the option that said use this drive letter?
       If you are positive that the drive letter in the heading above the
       options was the same as the drive letter of your CD-ROM, and you
       did select the option that said Use this drive letter, verify that
       the configuration file was correctly written. Open the directory
       that CD Answer was installed to and look for a file called
       _dw_.cfg. This is the CD Answer configuration file. It is a text
       file that can be edited using MS-DOS edit or Windows Notepad. Open
       this file and look for the line that says Driver = " ". In between
       the quotes you will probably see something like "D:\". Does the
       CD-ROM drive letter that was assigned to your CD-ROM drive match
       what is in the quotation marks? If not , change the drive letter in
       the quotation marks to match your CD-ROM drive letter. Close the
       file, making sure to save it.
       If you are not sure if the drive letter in the heading above the
       options was the same as your CD-ROM drive letter, or if you
       selected the option that said Use this drive letter, you can
       replace your CD-ROM drive letter in one of two ways:
       Go through the installation program again, this time when you are
       prompted to choose whether to use a driver name or drive letter,
       check in the heading above the options. Does the CD-ROM drive
       letter that was assigned to your CD-ROM drive match the drive
       letter listed in the heading? If not, select the option that allows
       you to use another drive letter, enter the drive letter of your
       CD-ROM drive in the box to the right of the words Database
       Location, and proceed with the installation.
       Open the directory that CD answer was installed to and look for a
       file called _dw_.cfg. This is the CD Answer configuration file. It
       is a text file that can be edited using MS-DOS edit or Windows
       Notepad. Open this file and look for the line that says Driver = "
       ". In between the quotes you will probably see something like
       "D:\". Does the CD-ROM drive letter that was assigned to your
       CD-ROM drive match what is in the quotation marks? If not, change
       the drive letter in the quotation marks to match your CD-ROM drive
       letter. Close the file, making sure to save it.
    6. If you get to this point and cannot run CD Answer, please note
       exactly any error messages that you receive and contact Dataware
       Customer Support at 617-577-2844.
