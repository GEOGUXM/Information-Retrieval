   Vandenberg launch goes smoothly By DIANE AINSWORTH Circling the Earth
   every 97 minutes, NASA's new QuikScat ocean-viewing satellite is in the
   thick of a series of cluster burns that will bring the spacecraft into
   a uniform, 800- kilometer (500-mile) mapping orbit for the start of the
   primary mission on July 19. "The spacecraft is extremely well behaved
   and the engineering and science teams are per- forming exceptionally
   well," said Jim Graf, QuikScat project manager at JPL. "In addition to
   that good fortune, the telemetry we're receiving actually looks better
   than the simula- tions. We're ecstatic with the satellite's perfor-
   mance so far." The QuikScat spacecraft with the SeaWinds instrument
   onboard will measure ocean surface winds, providing both speed and
   direction for use in oceanographic research, weather fore- casting and
   storm monitoring. PIA01342 Launched at 7:15 p.m. Pacific Daylight A
