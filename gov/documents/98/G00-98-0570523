                      Accessing ETDE's Energy Database

   ETDE's Energy Database is available to anyone in an ETDE member
   country.This benefit leads to invaluable opportunities for those in
   commercial and academic settings, as well as for those in government
   organizations. Any organization, library, or institution in an ETDE
   member country is eligible to access ETDE's database.

   The database is available publicly via the World Wide Web as ETDEWEB,
   and in a number of formats through commercial online hosts and on
   CD-ROM products. Each of these products offers advantages to the user.
   The representatives from each ETDE member country can provide
   information about the best access options for those in that country.

     * STN International

   In addition to these products, member organizations provide database
   access within their national borders. Member services are tailored to
   meet the specialized needs of their researchers, policymakers, and
   other customers. Such services include selective dissemination of
   information (SDI) programs, in-house database systems, full-text
   delivery services, special searching services, and publications
   containing database abstracts in specific subject areas.

   The exchange of full-text documents that are not easily available
   elsewhere is another important aspect of ETDE's information sharing.
   This non-conventional literature (also known as grey literature)
   includes documents such as government reports, technical papers, and
   some conference proceedings. Information about sources of the full text
   of non-conventional literature has been provided by ETDE's member
   countries.
