   Nevada Test Site

   [ Photograph ] Nevada Test Site A unique national resource, the Nevada
   Test Site is a massive outdoor laboratory and national experimental
   center that cannot be duplicated.  Larger than the state of Rhode
   Island, approximately 1,375 square miles, making this one of the
   largest restricted access areas in the United States. The remote site
   is surrounded by thousands of additional acres of land withdrawn from
   the public domain for use as a protected wildlife range and for a
   military gunnery range, creating an unpopulated land area comprising
   some 5,470 square miles.

   Established as the Atomic Energy Commission's on-continent proving
   ground, the Nevada Test Site has seen more than four decades of nuclear
   weapons testing. Since the nuclear weapons testing moratorium in 1992
   and under the direction of the Department of Energy (DOE), test site
   use has diversified into many other programs such as hazardous chemical
   spill testing, emergency response training, conventional weapons
   testing, and waste management and environmental technology studies.
