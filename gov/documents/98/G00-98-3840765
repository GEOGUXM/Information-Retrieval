   Personal Service (Consulting) Contracts

   Personal services or consulting services, as they are commonly called,
   include a variety of types of professional and technical services which
   Washington State agencies purchase such as: actuarial services,
   financial and economic analysis, environmental planning, legal
   services, management consulting, marketing services, needs assessment,
   quality assurance, research, scientific studies, statistical analysis,
   strategic planning, etc.

   The state law governing personal services is Revised Code of Washington
   39.29. Competition for procurement of personal services is provided
   within the law. State agencies have authority to conduct their own
   purchases for personal services, so such purchasing is done in a
   decentralized manner in Washington. Certain personal service contracts
   are, however, required to be filed with the Office of Financial
   Management for review and/or approval either prior to start of work or
   no later than the date of start of work. This review also results in a
   central location of personal service contract information for ease of
   public review.

   Client Service Contracts

   OFM is responsible for issuing contract guidelines for client service
   contracts, but agencies procure and award their own client service
   contracts. Client services are defined in RCW 39.29.006(2) as: services
   provided directly to agency clients including, but not limited to,
   medical and dental services, employment and training programs,
   residential care, and subsidized housing.

   Clients are generally members of the public, external to state
   government, who have social, physical, medical, economic, or
   educational needs. These individuals may require government assistance
   to meet those needs. Clients are those for whom the agency has
   statutory responsibility to serve, protect, or oversee. For example,
   clients of the Department of Social and Health Services include nursing
   home patients, institutionalized individuals, or children in need of
   therapy. Clients of the Department of Labor and Industries include
   injured workers. Clients of the Employment Security Department include
   unemployed and displaced workers and veterans.
