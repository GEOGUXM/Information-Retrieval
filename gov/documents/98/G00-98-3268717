   Introduction

   In the late 19th century, elements of a hatchery system for Pacific
   salmon started to develop. Hatcheries are fish breeding and raising
   centers that have been built primarily to enhance harvest in
   commercial, sport, and Tribal fisheries, and reduce the impacts of
   development that destroys or degrades salmon habitat and blocks
   migratory routes.

   Salmon have existed for millions of years and are a critical part of
   the Pacific Northwest's economy and culture. As the demand for salmon
   has grown, so has our dependence on hatcheries. Hatcheries currently
   contribute between 70-80% of the fish in coastal salmon and steelhead
   fisheries in the Pacific Northwest.

   Over the past several decades, wild salmon populations have declined
   dramatically, despite, and perhaps sometimes because of, the
   contribution of hatcheries. Many salmon stocks in Washington and Oregon
   are now listed as either threatened or endangered under the U.S.
   Endangered Species Act. With this decline has come an increased focus
   on the preservation of indigenous wild salmon stocks.

   Hatcheries have the potential to assist in the conservation of wild
   stocks, but they also pose some risks. At this time, scientists still
   have many questions about the extent to which hatchery programs enhance
   or threaten the survival of wild populations. Additional research and
   investigation is needed.

   This list of Q&As provides some general information about hatcheries
   and the interaction of hatchery fish with wild stocks. The Q&As were

   Introductory Q&As

   Why is salmon conservation important?

   Salmon conservation is important for biological, economic, cultural,
   and religious reasons. Salmon play a major role in aquatic and
   terrestrial ecosystems. When salmon return to their natal streams to
   spawn and die, they bring large amounts of nutrients from the marine
   environment into rivers and streams, where they enrich both plant and
   animal life.

   Salmon are a part of Native American spiritual and cultural identity.
   Salmon support religious ceremonies held by Pacific Northwest Indian
   Tribes and are a vital part of Tribal economies. Salmon also support
   the greater Pacific Northwest economy. In 1996, fish caught by
   Washington commercial fishers were worth an estimated $148 million. In
   addition, recreational anglers spent approximately $700 million on
   fishing related expenses, which translates into about $1.3 billion and
   over 15,000 jobs.

   Life in the Pacific Northwest would be very different without salmon.

   What are hatcheries?

   Hatcheries are facilities where fish are bred and raised for at least
   part of their life cycle. Click here to learn about the salmon life

   What happens at a hatchery?

   Hatcheries vary in their practices but the general process is as
   follows:

      salmon returning to spawn in hatcheries or in rivers and streams
     are captured
      eggs and sperm are collected and mixed together
      fertilized eggs are incubated
      hatched fish are placed in holding tanks to grow and develop
      fish are released into the river
      fish spend 1-3 years in the ocean
      fish that are not harvested return to the hatchery or spawning
     grounds

   Why are there hatcheries?

   Hatcheries improve the survival of young salmon (eggs, fry, and
   juveniles). More young salmon survive in the hatchery than would
   survive in the wild because there are no predators in hatcheries, food
   is abundant, and the environment is relatively constant. Click here to
   learn about the potential benefits of this increase in survival.

   Why should we focus on conserving "wild" populations? Why not rely
   instead on hatcheries?

   Wild salmon have existed for millions of years. The oldest salmon
   fossil dates back about 50 million years. Pacific salmon, as we know
   them today, emerged about 2 million years ago. Remaining natural salmon
   populations provide the best chance for long-term survival of salmon
   because they have had to evolve and respond to significant
   environmental changes over many thousands of years, and can be expected
   to do so in the future.

   Salmon hatcheries can provide a number of benefits to society, but
   reliance on salmon hatcheries as a substitute for the conservation of
   wild populations is risky as a long-term conservation strategy. While
   wild salmon populations have existed for many thousands of years, most
   hatchery populations have only existed for several decades or less. We
   do not know if hatchery stocks have the same resilience as wild salmon
   populations. If hatchery stocks can't survive on their own in the wild,
   they will need a hatchery to sustain them forever. This can be
   problematic because:

      mechanical and technical difficulties occur periodically in
     hatcheries, such as disruption of power or water supplies or disease
     outbreaks; and

      hatcheries are expensive to operate, requiring a large and
     constant source of funds.

   Why worry about salmon conservation? Why don't we just wait until ocean
   conditions change?

   Ocean conditions (e.g., air and sea temperature, currents, and
   productivity) fluctuate from year to year, as well as during periodic
   events, such as El Nino and La Nina. Because salmon typically spend
   between 1-3 years in the ocean before returning to their natal streams
   to spawn, ocean conditions impact salmon survival and growth. It is
   true that even if we don't take any direct salmon conservation actions,
   we may temporarily see higher adult returns, as a result of more
   favorable ocean conditions. For example, adult salmon returns in many
   parts of the Pacific Northwest were higher in 2000 and 2001 than they
   had been for many yearsa result that is primarily attributed to
   favorable ocean conditions. But waiting for improved ocean conditions
   is not a good conservation strategy for salmon because:

      No one is sure whether we are about to enter a more favorable
     period of ocean conditions for Pacific Northwest salmon or, if we
     are, how long it will last; and

      Even if salmon do experience a long period of better ocean
     conditions, if we don't address the underlying causes of salmon
     decline (habitat loss and degradation, hydropower, development,
     harvest, and hatchery propagation), any "recovery" the salmon
     experience will be temporary, and the next time ocean conditions
     decline we could see widespread extinction of salmon populations.

   General Hatchery Q&As

   Why are hatcheries controversial?

   Hatcheries are controversial because:

     1) For more than a century they have been viewed as a substitute for
     addressing the root causes of salmon decline, like loss and
     degradation of habitat, blockage of migratory routes, and
     over-harvest.

     2) While it is not hard to identify risks that hatcheries pose for
     wild populations, it is not so easy to predict whether damaging
     effects to natural populations will occur in any specific case, and
     if they do, how serious the effects will be.

     3) Critics of hatcheries sometimes disagree among themselves and
     don't always present consistent proposals for change.

     4) They have strong support from groups that rely on them to provide
     fish for commercial, recreational, and Tribal harvest, as well as
     jobs.

     5) There has been little effort to develop a comprehensive
     cost-benefit analysis that outlines the value and costs of
     hatcheries.

   Are there different types of hatcheries

   Each hatchery program is unique. The easiest way to differentiate
   hatcheries is to look at their goals and how they implement those
   goals. Hatcheries have one of three basic goals:

     1. To Produce Fish for Harvest

     2. To Recover Wild Populations

     3. Fish for Harvest and Recover Wild Populations

                                 Back to top
     __________________________________________________________________

   What benefits can hatcheries provide to wild populations?

   The primary goal of a hatchery is to ensure high survival of eggs, fry,
   and juvenileslife stages that typically experience high mortality in
   the wild. By collecting broodstock from the wild, a successful salmon
   hatchery can produce more returning adults than would have occurred in
   the wild.

     Potential benefits to society include:
      Continued harvest
      Reducing the impacts of development or blockage of access to
     habitat
      Recovery of wild stocks

     Potential benefits of hatcheries in wild stock recovery include:
      Minimizing short-term extinction risks for endangered populations
      Helping to maintain a population at a safe level until factors for
     decline can be addressed, such as habitat degradation and loss
      Speeding recovery by providing a demographic boost to an existing
     population
      Reintroducing salmon into vacant habitat

     __________________________________________________________________

   What risks do hatcheries pose to wild populations?

   Scientists have known for decades that salmon spawned and reared in
   hatcheries tend to become different from their wild ancestors. Risks to
   wild populations from hatchery fish include the following:

      Genetic
      Ecological
      Behavioral
      Overfishing
      Fish Health

                                 Back to top
     __________________________________________________________________

   Have hatcheries improved in recent years?
   Considerable improvements have been made in fish culture and fisheries
   management. Some of these improvements include:

      more focus on local broodstocks
      better broodstock collection and mating protocols
      more natural rearing conditions
      more natural release strategies

   These changes have helped to reduce the direct and indirect effects of
   hatchery programs on natural fish populations (and in some cases have
   also increased hatchery productivity). It is important to note,
   however, that these changes can not make the risks that hatcheries pose
   to natural populations disappear altogether.

   Diversity Q&As

   What is genetic diversity and how is it important to the conservation
   of salmon?

   Genetic diversity is a part of "biodiversity," which refers to our
   planet's wide variety of life forms.
   Genes determine the characteristics of living things. Variation in
   genes allows organisms to evolve and adapt to new conditions. Two
   components of genetic diversity are important to maintaining healthy
   salmon populations:

      Diversity within populationsthat is, ensuring that not all
     individuals are alike and that there are differences between
     individuals in traits such as age, size, and migration timing.

      Diversity among populationsthat is, ensuring that not all salmon
     populations are alike and that there are differences between
     populations.

   Diversity within and among populations ensures that salmon populations
   have the ability to respond to changing environmental conditions (such
   as warmer or cooler sea temperatures). Without genetic diversity,
   salmon would be more susceptible to fluctuations because all
   individuals and/or populations would face the same environmental
   conditions, good or bad.

     Example of Diversity within populations
     Example of Diversity among populations

                                 Back to top
     __________________________________________________________________

   Why is it important to conserve salmon in the Pacific Northwest if
   there are salmon in Alaska?

   Diversity is not only important within and among populations but also
   at larger geographic scales. In the last decade, we have learned that,
   in general, salmon abundance in Alaska and in the Pacific Northwest is
   inversely relatedthat is, when salmon abundance is relatively high in
   Alaska, it is relatively low in the Pacific Northwest, and vice versa.
   This pattern appears to be driven by cycles in ocean productivity,
   lasting about 20-30 years. If we fail to conserve salmon in the Pacific
   Northwest, relying instead on salmon in Alaska, there would be no
   populations poised to take advantage of the next cycle of relatively
   good ocean conditions in the Pacific Northwest. Instead, all the
   remaining populations (in Alaska) would be exposed to relatively
   unfavorable conditions at the same time. This would greatly reduce the
   overall productivity of salmon, and increase the risk of extinction of
   the species as a whole. In addition, conserving salmon in Alaska but
   not in Pacific Northwest would ignore the major role salmon play in
   Pacific Northwest ecosystems, culture, economy, and religion.

   Surplus Hatchery Fish Q&As

   How do you get surplus hatchery fish?

   Many variables influence the number of fish that return to a hatchery,
   including changing ocean conditions, food availability, fishing
   pressures, and disease. Because the outcome of all of these variables
   is not predictable, it is impossible to know exactly how many hatchery
   fish will return in any given year. In years of relatively good ocean
   conditions, it is not uncommon for more adult hatchery fish to return
   than can be used to produce the next generation of hatchery fish and
   fulfill other needs at a hatchery. When hatchery programs get back more
   fish than they can use, these fish are considered to be surplus.

                                 Back to top
     __________________________________________________________________

   What is the maximum number of hatchery fish that can be incorporated
   into a wild population?

   There is no universal upper limit to the number of hatchery fish that
   can be allowed to spawn in the wild. Each individual hatchery program
   will have its own thresholda point above which the biological risks
   outweigh the benefits. For relatively healthy natural salmon
   populations, the optimal level of spawning by hatchery fish in the wild
   might be zero. In contrast, for natural salmon populations that are
   severely depressed, allowing a substantial number of hatchery fish to
   spawn naturally might be a reasonable approach to alleviate the short
   term risk of extinction. The optimal percentage of naturally spawning
   hatchery fish also depends on the history of the hatchery population
   and the characteristics of the ecosystem where they will be released
   (see carrying capacity issues). Hatchery populations that pose
   significant genetic risks (such as those where there is inbreeding or
   where non-native stocks are used as broodstock) can reduce the fitness
   and diversity of the natural population. In cases like this, few, if
   any, hatchery fish may be allowed to spawn naturally.

                                 Back to top
     __________________________________________________________________

   Can anything be done to reduce the frequency or magnitude of surpluses?

   Yes, some actions can be taken. It is important to note, however, that
   even though some things can be done to reduce the frequency and/or
   magnitude of the surpluses, surpluses cannot be eliminated entirely.
   The major reason for this is that the number of hatchery fish that
   survive after they are released as juveniles, can vary greatly due to
   fluctuating environmental conditions (e.g., warmer or cooler sea
   temperatures). Given this situation, one of the most important things a
   manager can do is to have a biologically sound plan in place to deal
   with hatchery surpluses. Each plan should comprehensively address the
   full range of scenarios that are likely to result.

   Actions that can be taken to reduce the frequency and/or magnitude of
   surpluses include:

     Reducing the scale of the hatchery program
     Fixing the underlying issues
     Selectively harvesting surplus hatchery fish

                                 Back to top
     __________________________________________________________________

   Is there anything that surplus fish can be used for?

   There are a wide range of uses for surplus hatchery fish that don't
   increase risk to natural populations. As surpluses occur, hatchery
   managers must decide which options are the most appropriate, depending
   on available opportunities and the quality of the fish. Possibilities
   for using surplus hatchery fish include:

      Providing the fish to tribal governments for ceremonial and
     subsistence purposes.

      Increasing fishing opportunities by taking fish downriver where
     they are released and allowed to swim back upriver, giving anglers
     another opportunity to harvest them.

      Providing fish to charitable organizations, prisons, and/or the
     general public for consumption.

      Processing the carcasses to make fish food in order to raise the
     next generation of hatchery fish.

      Giving the carcasses to wildlife rehabilitation centers to use as
     food.

      Placing the fish carcasses in streams to enrich the environment.

      Collecting some gametes from all adults to increase the genetic
     diversity of the hatchery population.

      Cyropreserving milt to alleviate problems that may arise in future
     years.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Are there any guidelines for euthanizing surplus fish?
   The U.S. Department of Food and Agriculture has guidelines for
   euthanizing animals intended for human or animal consumption. If fish
   are to be consumed, severance or destruction of the spinal cord or
   overanesthetizing with carbon dioxide are approved methods. If fish are
   not to be consumed, then another appropriate option is the use of
   MS-222 (a euthanasia agent that is dissolved in water and which fish
   are then immersed in).
