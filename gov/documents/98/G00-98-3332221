   Statement by Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt on the Census 2000
             "Initial Response Rate" for the State of California

                               April 19, 2000

   I want to commend the state of California, whose government went beyond
   what the Census Bureau itself could have done to promote Census 2000
   participation. In mounting your own promotional campaign, you
   complemented the Census Bureau’s paid advertisements.

   One-hundred and thirty-two out of 547 jurisdictions in California —
   that is, counties, cities and towns — met or exceeded their ‘90 Plus
   Five goals. This is a major accomplishment. Among the larger cities
   that beat their goals were Compton (6 percentage points above its goal
   of 54 percent), Santa Ana (4 percentage points above goal) and Anaheim
   and Modesto (both 3 percentage points above their goals).
   Carmel-by-the-Sea and Huron did 16 percentage points better than their
   goals, Colma and Irwindale surpassed their goals by 15 points and
   Laguna Woods beat its mark by 10 points.

   Our hearty congratulations to our partners in California and to the
   civic-minded people of our nation’s most populous state.
