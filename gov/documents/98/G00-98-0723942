   All federal agencies, including the Department of Transportation (DOT),
   are required under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to disclose
   records requested in writing by any person. However, depending on the
   purpose and use of such documents, there are circumstances under which
   agencies may withhold information pursuant to exemptions and exclusions
   specified by the Act. FOIA applies only to federal agencies and does
   not create a right of access to records held by Congress, the courts,
   or by state or local government agencies. Most states have public
   information laws governing access to state and local records.

   Each agency is responsible for meeting its FOIA responsibilities for
   its own records. Likewise, each DOT component is responsible for
   processing FOIA requests for the records it maintains. If you have any
   questions regarding OIG's FOIA office, please call 202-366-8751.

   We also urge you, before making a FOIA request, to first browse through
   OIGs Electronic Reading Room, for information on matters already
   available to the public.
