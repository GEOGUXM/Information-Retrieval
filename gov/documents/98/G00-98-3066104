   ATTACHMENT 1 52.226-1 Utilization of Indian Organizations and
   Indian-Owned Economic Enterprises. As prescribed in 26.104, insert the
   following clause: Utilization of Indian Organizations and Indian-Owned
   Economic Enterprises (June 2000) (a) Definitions. As used in this
   clause: "Indian" means any person who is a member of any Indian tribe,
   band, group, pueblo, or community that is recognized by the Federal
   Government as eligible for services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs
   (BIA) in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 1452(c) and any "Native" as defined
   in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601). "Indian
   organization" means the governing body of any Indian tribe or entity
   established or recognized by the governing body of an Indian tribe for
   the purposes of 25 U.S.C., chapter 17. "Indian-owned economic
   enterprise" means any Indian-owned (as determined by the Secretary of
   the Interior) commercial, industrial, or business activity established
   or organized for the purpose of profit, provided that Indian ownership
   constitutes not less than 51 percent of the enterprise. "Indian tribe"
   means any Indian tribe, band, group, pueblo, or community, including
   native villages and native groups (including corporations organized by
   Kenai, Juneau, Sitka, and Kodiak) as defined in the Alaska Native
   Claims Settlement Act, that is recognized by the Federal Government as
   eligible for services from BIA in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 1452(c).
   "Interested party" means a prime contractor or an actual or prospective
   offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award
   of a subcontract or by the failure to award a subcontract. (b) The
   Contractor shall use its best efforts to give Indian organizations and
   Indian-owned economic enterprises (25 U.S.C. 1544) the maximum
   practicable opportunity to participate in the subcontracts it awards to
   the fullest extent consistent with efficient performance of its
   contract. ATTACHMENT 1 (1) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor,
   acting in good faith, may rely on the representation of an Indian
   organization or Indian-owned economic enterprise as to its eligibility,
   unless an interested party challenges its status or the Contracting
   Officer has independent reason to question that status. In the event of
   a challenge to the representation of a subcontractor, the Contracting
   Officer will refer the matter to the-- U.S. Department of the Interior
   Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Attn: Chief, Division of Contracting and
   Grants Administration 1849 C Street, NW, MS-2626-MIB Washington, DC
   20240-4000. The BIA will determine the eligibility and notify the
   Contracting Officer. No incentive payment will be made within 50
   working days of subcontract award or while a challenge is pending. If a
   subcontractor is determined to be an ineligible participant, no
   incentive payment will be made under the Indian Incentive Program. (2)
   The Contractor may request an adjustment under the Indian Incentive
   Program to the following: (i) The estimated cost of a cost-type
   contract. (ii) The target cost of a cost-plus-incentive-fee prime
   contract. (iii) The target cost and ceiling price of a fixed-price
   incentive prime contract. (iv) The price of a firm-fixed-price prime
   contract. (3) The amount of the adjustment to the prime contract is 5
   percent of the estimated cost, target cost, or firm-fixed-price
   included in the subcontract initially awarded to the Indian
   organization or Indian-owned economic enterprise. (4) The Contractor
   has the burden of proving the amount claimed and must assert its
   request for an adjustment prior to completion of contract performance.
   ATTACHMENT 1 (c) The Contracting Officer, subject to the terms and
   conditions of the contract and the availability of funds, will
   authorize an incentive payment of 5 percent of the amount paid to the
   subcontractor. The Contracting Officer will seek funding in accordance
   with agency procedures. (End of clause) ATTACHMENT 2 SECTION B

   operating costs associated with awarding and managing this contract are
   recovered through a Contract Access Fee (CAF) of 1 percent of the
   task/delivery order amount. Contractors should include the CAF in the
   unit prices submitted with their task/delivery order offer(s). The
   previous modification (dated 4/28/00) incorporated the CAF of 1% and at
   the time of the modification, some task/delivery orders were already in
   progress. GSA could not expect the contractor to re-propose work to
   their clients so that GSA would receive the CAF. Unfortunately, a
   cutoff date needs to be established. Therefore, effective December 31,
   2000, all task/delivery orders shall include the CAF of 1%. All active
   Task/Delivery Orders and any modifications thereto in effect after
   December 31, 2000, regardless of initial award date, shall include the
   CAF. The contractor shall collect the CAF and rebate to GSA the amount
   of the fee. The CAF amount due shall be paid by check to: General
   Services Administration FTS, Solutions Development Center (6TS-A) P.O.
   Box 16020 Kansas City, MO 64112 Where multiple invoices and/or multiple
   task/delivery orders are involved, the CAF may be consolidated into one
   payment. To ensure the payment is credited properly, the contractor
   shall submit the check along with a printed copy of the Cost Recovery
   Report (CRR) as required by clause I.14 Contractor's Report of Sales.
   The contractor shall pay GSA not later than the fifth work day of each
   month, the CAF for all invoices for which payment has been received by
   the contractor during the reporting period. If the full amount of the
   CAF is not paid within 30 calendar days after the end of the applicable
   payment date, it shall constitute a debt to the United States
   Government under the Debt Collection Act of 1982, including withholding
   or setting off payments and interest on the debt (see FAR 52.232-17,
   Interest). If the contractor fails to submit documented sales reports,
   payments, falsifies payment documentation, or fails to pay the CAF in a
   timely manner, the Government may terminate or cancel the contract.
   Willful failure or refusal to furnish the required reports,
   falsification of reports, or failure to pay the CAF timely constitutes
   sufficient cause for terminating the contractor for cause under the
   termination provisions of this contract. ATTACHMENT 4 I.14 CONTRACTOR'S
   REPORT OF SALES Cost Recovery Report (CRR) . CRR's shall be submitted
   with the CAF and sent to the following: General Services Administration
   FTS, Solutions Development Center (6TS-A) P.O. Box 16020 Kansas City,
   MO 64112 The Government reserves the right to inspect without further
   notice, such records of the contractor as pertain to orders under this
   contract. Willful failure or refusal to furnish the required reports,
