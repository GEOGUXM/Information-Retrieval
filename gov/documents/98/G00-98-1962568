   The Washington D.C. Earth Science Information Center ceased operations
   on December 28. Customers are being directed to the Reston ESIC or the
   888-ASK-USGS telephone system.

   Learning Web Image of butterfly The USGS unveils a new Learning Web for
   Earth Science Week beginning October 9. The new Learning Web will have:
     * a brand new look with enhanced search capability
     * a dynamic database that links science and education
     * eye-popping exploration of natural science
     * educational glossaries covering geology, biology, cartography and
       hydrology
     * help with school projects and homework
     * lesson plans and activities for all ages
     * links to other educational sites

   Image of DOI Window on Earth Science In keeping with the spirit of
   Celebrating Earth Science Week a team of employees from Eastern Region
   Geography (ERG) headed down to the Department of the Interior (DOI) to
   create a new display highlighting ESW. The team consisted of Bob
   Kelley, Steve LePage, Loreen Utz, and Beth Stettner. The display which
   is located near the DOI cafeteria entrance showcases the new National
   Atlas separate on Presidential Elections, the Solar System Poster, and
   the Chesapeake Bay Poster. In keeping with a patriotic theme, the
   colors of red, white, and blue are visible throughout the display as
   well as a large American Flag. In addition, the earth science packets
   created by the American Geological Institute are on display as well as
   many USGS general interest publications.

   Small image of South Florida Everglades The South Florida Image Map is
   now on-line. Digital versions of the recently published South Florida
   Everglades image map are now available via the Internet. A merged copy
   of the two-map set was scanned to National Archive standards and posted
   on the South Florida Information Access web site. The file is available
   for download at several resolutions and a CD-ROM of the file at full
   resolution can be requested. SOFIA is the mechanism for the exchange of
   USGS data and information related to South Florida research and
   restoration activities.

   Library Poster The newly formed USGS Library Consortium is sponsoring a
   USGS Librarians' Meeting August 7-9 in Reston, Virginia. Welcoming
   remarks will be given by USGS Director, Chip Groat; Eastern Region
   Director, Bonnie McGregor; and Geographic Information Officer, Karen
   Siderelis. USGS librarians from all disciplines and regions will
   participate in sessions which will shape the future of the Consortium,
   help them learn to more effectively reach out to their customers,
   provide opportunities to get to know each other better, and encourage
   interaction with other USGS information providers.

   Boy Scout Jamboree Region Map A special edition of the Rappahannock
   Academy quadrangle was updated for this year's national Scout Jamboree.
   The front is a standard USGS 1:24,000-scale map showing the Jamboree
   area. The back side is a color infrared orthophotograph of the Jamboree
   grounds, a locator map, and text about the National Mapping Program and
   USGS. Thirty-eight thousand maps were printed and folded for
   distribution at the Jamboree plus copies for USGS sales distribution.

   Science Camp Logo Science Camp 2001 begins June 25! The U.S. Geological
   Survey (USGS) is proud to announce the 6th year of the Reston
   Association-USGS Science Camp partnership. Science camp consists of
   four 2-week sessions that end August 17. Children ages 8-12 will
   experience science lab, computer time, and visits from guest scientists
   each week. The Science Camp is run and operated by the Reston
   Association and managed by the National Center's Visitors Center with
   the cooperation and assistance of security, safety, and facilities.

   Mosquito image In collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control
   and USGS Geographic Research, the CINDI launched the West Nile Virus
   Web site. The site displays the occurrence and distribution through
   time of the disease by State and by county for five types of disease
   cases.

   Fire image collage on the National Fire Plan Website Check out the
   National Fire Plan Web site, a cooperative effort of the USDA Forest
   Service and the Department of the Interior. In response to the
   devastating fires of 2000, the USDA Forest Service and the Department
   of the Interior have embarked on a long-term commitment to better
   manage the impacts of wildland fire on communities and the environment.

   Thumbnail of GNIS Page GNIS Users! The "Geographic Names Information
   System" (GNIS) page is now on a new Oracle web server with a
   reprogrammed and improved GNIS public web site. You can locate the new
   URL at http://geonames.usgs.gov . Please check us out and use this
   great resource for locating popular features of the United States and
   Antarctica.

   New Status Graphics online: Status graphics depicting selected USGS
   Digital Cartographic Data in the Chesapeake Bay Region are online at
   http://chesapeake.usgs.gov/statusgraphics/statusgraphics.html.

   picture of the Caves Teaching Packet
   The "Exploring Caves" teacher's packet is on-line at
   mac.usgs.gov/mac/isb/pubs/teachers-packets/exploringcaves/. Two kids
   get lost in a cave and are guided out by a friendly bat. As the
   students follow the bat through the five chapters, the adventures
   include meeting cave residents, learning about the cave ecosystems, and
   finding a primitive cave painting. The packet helps the students learn
   about limestone cavesgeology, biology, earth science, mineralogy,
   hydrology, and other sciences using a read-aloud story, activities, and
   coloring sheets. Poster is now available for $7.00 plus handling fee,
   call 1-888-ASK-USGS for more information.

   The very popular teacher packets Volcanoes, Global Change, What Do Maps
   Show?, and Map Adventures are available in both HTML and PDF versions
   on the Educational Materials page of the USGS Information Products
   About Mapping and Related Subjects Web site.
