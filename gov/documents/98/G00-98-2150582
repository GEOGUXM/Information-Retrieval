   CHARLOTTE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER LETTER TO AIRMEN 01-01

   SUBJECT:  Area Navigation (RNAV) routes through Charlotte Approach
   Control Airspace

    CANCELLATION:  January 30, 2003

   In order to expedite the handling of IFR overflight traffic through
   Charlotte Approach Control Airspace, several Area Navigation (RNAV)
   Routes have been developed in coordination and cooperation with the
   Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.  These routes are listed
   below.  Pilots desiring to avail themselves of these services should
   include the appropriate route when filing their flight plan.  Any RNAV
   capable aircraft filing flight plan equipment codes of /E, /F or /G may
   file these routes.  Other aircraft may request vectors along these
   routes but should only expect vector routes as workload permits.

    The future plan is to publish the routes in the FAA’s Airport Facility
   Directory (AFD).

   Comments on these routes may be sent to Charlotte ATC Tower at
   704-359-1000.
