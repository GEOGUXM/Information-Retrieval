   Where to Land on Mars?

   Of all the places to land on Mars, where in the world should twin
   rovers go? This question has been on the front burner of discussion
   with Mars scientists who have the arduous task of selecting a site
   where it is safe to land. Read More...

   If Santa Were a Martian

   If Santa Claus were a martian, he'd be in for one bumpy ride.

   That's the assessment of navigators and engineers controlling the
   flight of NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft as it presently flies
   four times daily above the north polar region of Mars.

   Machinists to the Stars

   It's the middle of the night at JPL, and the usual dozens of deer are
   on their nightly foraging rounds across the campus. Mars is up. So is
   the Moon. And so are nine machinists in the lab's high-precision
   fabrication shop, working the second shift that ends between midnight
   and 3 a.m. Read More...
