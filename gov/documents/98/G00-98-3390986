  Abstract

   St. Clair River is a connecting channel of the Great Lakes between Lake
   Huron and Lake St. Clair. The river forms part of the international
   boundary between the United States and Canada in the eastern Lower
   Peninsula of Michigan and southern Ontario. Drifting buoys were
   deployed to help investigate flow characteristics near public water
   intakes in ten reaches of St. Clair River from October 3-5, 2000. In
   eight deployments, buoys were released at uniform intervals in a
   transect across the river to better understand flow patterns. In the
   remaining six deployments, buoys were released in a cluster near the
   middle of the channel to study turbulent dispersion characteristics.
   The eight spherical and seven cylindrical buoys used in the study were
   equipped with drogues and had similar drift characteristics. Each buoy
   contained a geographical positioning system (GPS) to monitor its
   movement. Computer animations were developed that integrated these GPS
   data with data shown on navigational charts. These computer animations,
   which can be viewed through the Internet, provide a scientific
   visualization tool to study the deployments.

  Introduction

   Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) Source Water
   Assessment Program (SWAP), in cooperation the U.S. Geological Survey
   (USGS), is assessing the vulnerability of 13 public water supplies
   along the St. Clair-Detroit River Waterway. Intakes in this area
   provide water to about one third of the residents of Michigan. The
   assessment will identify likely sources of water to public supply
   intakes and provide a basis for planning emergency responses to
   contaminant spills. Drifting buoy deployments described in this report
   were conducted as part of this assessment to better understand flow
   patterns and turbulent dispersion characteristics in St. Clair River.

    Location

   St. Clair River is a connecting channel between Lake Huron and Lake St.
   Clair that forms part of the international boundary between the United
   States and Canada (fig. 1). In addition to being a major commercial
   navigation route through the Great Lakes, the river provides a water
   supply for adjacent communities. Port Huron, Marysville, St. Clair,
   Marine City, and Algonac, Michigan, in addition to communities in the
   Canadian province of Ontario, have water intakes on St. Clair River.

   fig. 1
   Figure 1. Location of St. Clair River between the United States and
   Canada.

   St. Clair River extends about 39 miles from its head at the outlet of
   Lake Huron to its mouth on Lake St. Clair. The river discharges an
   average of 182,000 ft^3/s (cubic feet per second) from a drainage area
   of about 222,400 mi^2 (square miles). Within the river, water surface
   elevations fall about 5 ft (feet), much of which occurs in the upper
   reaches of the river. Model simulations show that average flow
   velocities range from about 5.76 ft/s (feet per second) near Port
   Huron, Michigan during high flow conditions to about 1.84 ft/s near
   Algonac, Michigan during low-flow conditions (Coordinating Committee on
   Great Lakes Hydraulic and Hydrologic Data, 1986).

    Purpose and Scope

   Drifting buoys, which carried geographical positioning systems (GPS),
   were deployed to help describe flow patterns and turbulent dispersion
   characteristics within selected reaches of St. Clair River. Computer
   animations showing the generalized buoy movements during these
   deployments were developed to aid visualization of the results. Flow
   and stage data are provided as supporting information. Further analysis
   and interpretation of these data is needed to quantify hydraulic
   properties of the river for the vulnerability analysis.

    Previous Investigation

   The Detroit District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (1983)
   conducted a drifting buoy study of St. Clair River in May and June of
   1982. In this study, drifting buoy movements were monitored from the
   air. Detailed plots provide quantitative surface-current velocity data
   throughout the river and graphs of wind velocity. The study enhances
   emergency preparedness by providing detailed information on local flow
   patterns, thus facilitating the prediction of constituent transport.

    Acknowledgements

   The study was made possible by funding from the Michigan Department of
   Environmental Quality (MDEQ), Source Water Assessment Program (SWAP).
   Brad Brogren of MDEQ assisted with the field deployment and recovery of
   the buoys. Environment Canada provided the use of their research
   vessel, The Pelican, and the assistance of Brian Magee and Aaron
   Thompson to help deploy, track, and recover the buoys. Staff from the
   Detroit District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), John
   Koschik, Paul Taylor, Marty Kuhn, and Phil Ross measured streamflow in
   St. Clair River and major tributaries during the deployments. Rick
   Hooper, Office of Water Quality of the USGS provided the spherical
   buoys, and John Costa, USGS Office of Surface Water, provided enhanced
   equipment for recording buoy positions. Stewart Rounds, USGS Oregon
   District, integrated the report text and animations to create the web
   version of the report.

  Methods

    Drifting Buoys Construction

   Eight spherical and seven cylindrical buoys were deployed in St. Clair
   River. The spherical buoys are surface drifters that were originally
   designed for extended deployments in ocean environments by Clearwater
   Oceanographic Instrumentation. These buoys are about 16 inches in
   diameter and weigh about 45 pounds (fig. 2). They are equipped with
   telemetry to transmit positional information to satellite or hand-held
   receivers. For St. Clair River deployments, the electronics of these
   buoys were enhanced to decrease the sampling interval from 30 minutes
   to about 90 seconds and to increase the precision of positional
   information from about 700 ft to about 70 ft. Local interferences,
   however, often reduced the average sampling intervals to more than 180
   seconds. One of the spherical buoys was enhanced to internally record
   data at one-second intervals.

   fig. 2
   Figure 2. Spherical buoy and plastic bucket drogue used in the drifting
   buoy deployments on St. Clair River.

   The cylindrical buoys were constructed by joining a 9-inch length of
   3-inch diameter PVC (polyvinyl chloride) pipe with a 36-inch length of
   4-inch diameter PVC pipe (fig 3). The 3-inch diameter pipe floated
   above the waterline (fig. 4) and contained a Garmin GPS 12 unit that
   was set to internally record positional information at 45-second
   intervals. The specified positional accuracy of the Garmin GPS units,
   during the period of the Selective Availability Program, was 49 ft
   (Garmin Corporation, 1999). The 4-inch diameter part of the cylindrical
   buoys provided buoyancy. The lower end of the buoy was weighted to help
   provide a vertical orientation when deployed.

   Figure 3. Cylindrical buoy used in deployments on St. Clair River.

   fig. 4
   Figure 4. Spherical and cylindrical buoys drifting in St. Clair River.

   The U.S. Department of Defense Selective Availability Program had been
   discontinued before these buoy deployments. Thus, the accuracy of the
   positional information is considered constant throughout the
   deployments. In some deployments, positional data was not transmitted
   or recorded from one or more buoys with sufficient frequency to include
   in the animations.

   All buoys were equipped with drogues to reduce the effects of wind on
   buoy movements. Drogues were made from 5-gallon plastic buckets that
   were suspended about 3 feet below the bottom of the buoys. Holes were
   cut in the bottom of the buckets to allow drainage and facilitate buoy
   recovery. The drogues were weighted so that they remained suspended
   below the buoys. Floats were attached to the buoys to facilitate
   recovery.

    Buoy Deployments

   Fourteen buoy deployments were used to investigate flow characteristics
   in ten reaches of St. Clair River. Deployments generally lasted about 1
   hour. During all deployments, winds were generally light to calm (under
   10 miles per hour) and wave heights were generally less than one foot.
   Thus, winds and waves are not thought to significantly impact buoy
   movements during these deployments.

   In eight of the deployments, buoys were distributed at about equal
   distances in a transect across the river. In these transect
   deployments, spherical and cylindrical buoys were generally released
   alternately. The transect deployments were used to investigate flow
   patterns and relative velocities within the reach.

   In the remaining six deployments, buoys were released in a tightly
   grouped cluster near the center of the channel. The cluster deployments
   were used to investigate the turbulent dispersion characteristics of
   the reach.

    Ancillary Data

   Streamflow. Staff from the Detroit District of the U.S. Army Corps of
   Engineers measured streamflow on St. Clair River and selected
   tributaries by use of an acoustic Doppler current profiler (Table 1).
   Streamflow during the buoy deployments was generally lower than
   average.

   Table 1. Streamflow measurements during buoy deployments on St. Clair
   River. [Measurements were taken by the Detroit District of the U.S.
   Army Corps of Engineers.]

   Stage. Water surface elevation (stage) is recorded at 6-minute
   intervals at six National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
   gauges on St. Clair River. During the buoy deployments, average water
   levels remained fairly constant (fig. 5). Greater variation in water
   levels, however, was detected at upstream gauges than downstream
   gauges. Specifically, the standard deviation of water levels ranged
   from 0.12 foot at the Fort Gratiot gauge compared to a standard
   deviation of 0.05 foot at the Algonac gauge.

   deployments.

    Animation Techniques

   Buoy animations were developed by use of LiveMotion®, a software
   product of Adobe Corporation. All animations represent one minute of
   actual deployment time as one second of animation time. Background maps
   for the animations were scanned from 1:15,000 scale maps (National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 1999), which show contour and
   point depths of flow in feet below low-water datum. The pixel
   coordinates of the scanned images were registered with positional
   information on the maps to facilitate plotting of measured buoy
   locations. Buoy locations were generally included at about 90-second
   intervals, when GPS data was available. Between measured locations,
   buoy positions were automatically interpolated by use of a Bezier
   curve. Pairs of Macromedia Flash file format (SWF) and hypertext markup
   language (html) files were created to display the animations through
   the Internet. A Flash file reader plug in for standard Internet
   browsers is available without charge from Macromedia.

  Results

   Data on buoy deployments were animated to help visualize the flow
   pattern and turbulent dispersion characteristics near public water
   intakes on St. Clair River. Figure 6 shows the locations of the drifter
   studies, with links to the animations.

  Summary

   The Michigan Department of Natural Resources, in cooperation with the
   U.S. Geological Survey, is conducting a source water assessment of
   public water supply intakes on St. Clair River. As part of this
   assessment, 14 deployments of drifting buoys were used to investigate
   flow patterns and turbulent dispersion characteristics in ten reaches
   of St. Clair River from October 3-5, 2000. As many as eight spherical
   and seven cylindrical drifting buoys were used in each deployment. The
   spherical buoys transmitted identification, time, and position
   information as frequently as every 90 seconds to a receiver carried
   aboard the Environment Canada research vessel the Pelican. The
   cylindrical buoys carried a handheld GPS device that stored time and
   positional information at 45-second intervals. Data on buoy movements
   during the deployments were animated and referenced to a navigational
   chart to help visualize the results. The animations are available
   through the Internet to those interested in the flow characteristics of
   St. Clair River.
