   Introduction

   "The flexibility to assure quality diabetes services for your
   community"

   Thank you for choosing the Indian Health Service (IHS) Integrated
   Diabetes Education and Clinical Standards Recognition Program. The IHS
   Recognition Program enables you to seek recognition of quality diabetes
   education and care services offered within your community. The IHS
   Recognition Program offers you flexibility in measuring your program
   success against nationally accepted standards.
   The IHS recognition program allows you to build program success by
   using a three-stage approach:

   Level 1 - Developmental
   Completion of all elements at this level shows your community that your
   health services are starting work to develop a quality diabetes
   program.
   Level 2 - Educational
   Completion of all elements at this level shows your community that you
   provide quality diabetes education services.
   Level 3 - Integrated Diabetes Program
   Completion of all elements at this level shows your community that you
   provide quality diabetes education, clinical and public health
   services. Recognition at this level is the best you can be! It means
   that your facility offers the best in diabetes care and education
   practices. This includes community-wide prevention programs, diabetes
   clinical systems and educational programs for people with diabetes and
   their families.

   This was developed to assist you in meeting your diabetes recognition
   needs. We use the National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management, May
   2000, as the framework. Each of the ten standards is divided into three
   sections: developmental, educational and the integrated public health
   approach. Programs applying for the IHS Diabetes Education Program
   Recognition must meet the review criteria listed in the developmental
   (level 1) and educational (level 2) sections. Programs also have the
   choice to apply for the IHS Integrated Diabetes Program Recognition by
   meeting the review criteria elements at all levels.
