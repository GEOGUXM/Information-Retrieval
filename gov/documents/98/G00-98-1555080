   The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) is a cooperative
   asset-sharing program among Federal government agencies, state and
   local governments, and the private businesses and civilian volunteers
   to ensure resources are available to provide medical services following
   a disaster that overwhelms the local health care resources.

   The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) is a Federally coordinated
   system that augments the Nation's emergency medical response
   capability. The overall purpose of the NDMS is to establish a single,
   integrated national medical response capability for assisting state and
   local authorities in dealing with the medical and health effects of
   major peacetime disasters and providing support to the military and
   Veterans Health Administration medical systems in caring for casualties
   evacuated back to the U.S. from overseas armed conflicts.
