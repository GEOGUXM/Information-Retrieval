   Fission Track Radiography

   This technique measures the spatial distribution of trace amounts of
   uranium in a variety of solid materials, at a microscopic scale.
   Fission of ^235U is induced during slow neutron bombardment. Fission
   fragments emitted from the polished surface of a small sample are
   recorded as a visible image of fission tracks in a "detector" of mica
   that is placed over the sample. The density of recorded fission tracks
   is directly proportional to the uranium concentration in the sample.
   This low cost spatial-chemical measurement of U can only be duplicated
   by the most advanced microbeam analytical instruments. Recent
   applications include screening of suitable samples for dating by
   U-series or U-Pb methods, measuring U distribution in small particles
   of coal fly ash, and determining mineral hosts of U in polished thin
   sections of natural or contaminated rocks and soils. In some cases the
   distribution of U can be used as a proxy to suggest the residence of
   other trace elements of environmental concern such as radium, or
   arsenic.

   Geochronology

   Call 303-236-5619

   This is the science that deals with measuring past time and assigns
   events to their proper dates based on geologic data.
   ^40Ar / ^39 Ar Geochronology

   The ^40Ar / ^39Ar isotopic dating technique is a variant of the
   conventional K-Ar method and is based on the formulation of  ^39Ar
   during irradiation of potassium-bearing samples. It is used to date
   terrestrial rocks and minerals as well as meteorites and lunar samples
   ranging in age from approximately 30,000 years to the age of the Solar
   System (4.65 billion years). The method is derived from the natural
   occurrence of the radioactive isotope of potassium, ^40K, which has a
   dual decay to ^40Ca and ^40Ar and a half-life of 1250 million years.
   Radiogenic ^40Ar ideally accumulates in a mineral over geologic time.
   So by irradiating a sample of unknown age with a standard of known age
   and then measuring the abundances of argon isotopes, we can determine
   an ^40Ar / ^39Ar date, that is, the sample's geologic age. As a result
   of irradiation, ^39Ar serves as a proxy for potassium since it is
   produced from ^39K by fast neutron bombardment. After irradiation,
   argon isotopes are extracted from samples and standards and separately
   measured on a gas-source mass spectrometer. Apparent ages for the
   samples then are calculated by comparing the sample's ^40Ar / ^39Ar
   ratio with that of the standard. Isotopic measurements on modern mass
   spectrometers are highly sensitive and precise. Thus, very small
   amounts of material, ranging in size from a single mineral grain to a
   few millimeters, are analyzed commonly with small associated analytical
   errors (less than 0.25% absolute).

   ^40Ar / ^39Ar geochronology has evolved rapidly over the past 25 years
   into one of the most commonly used isotopic dating techniques because
   of its applicability to a broad range of geologic problems. At the U.S
   Geological Survey, ^40Ar / ^39Ar geochronology is used primarily for
   mission-related scientific research funded through congressionally
   mandated programs. Currently, the method is applied to geologic studies
   on the origin and thermal histories of mineral deposits; emplacement,
   cooling, and uplift history of plutonic rocks; formation of metamorphic
   belts; development of volcanic terranes, formation and amalgamation of
   the Earth's crust; age and development of the landscape; and the timing
   of catastrophic events in earth history, such as the K/T boundary
   event. Argon laboratories have hosted more than 200 guest investigators
   from other agencies, academia, and other countries.

   Introduction

   Neutron activation analysis (NAA) is an analytical technique that
   relies on the measurement of gamma-rays emitted from a sample that was
   irradiated by neutrons. The rate at which gamma-rays are emitted from
   an element in a sample is directly proportional to the concentration of
   that element. The major advantages of NAA are that:
    1. it is a multi-element technique capable of simultaneously
       determining up to about 50 elements in many materials
    2. it is non-destructive and therefore, does not suffer from the
       errors associated with yield determinations
    3. it has very high sensitivities for most of the elements that can be
       determined by NAA - most detection limits range from 0.05 to 50 ppm
    4. it is highly precise and accurate - overall errors of less than 2%
       relative standard deviation can be achieved for many elements
    5. samples as small as a few micrograms can be analyzed by NAA
     __________________________________________________________________

   Principle

   The process for analyzing samples by NAA involves irradiating them with
   a neutron source. Neutrons are captured by elements in the sample to
   produce unstable radioactive isotopes (radio-nuclides). Beta particles,
   and in some cases gamma-rays, are emitted from the radio-nuclides as
   they decay. The energies of these gamma-rays are, in general, distinct
   for a specific nuclide and the rate at which these photons are emitted
   with a particular energy can be measured using high-resolution
   semiconductor detectors. Because the production and decay rate of
   gamma-ray radiation are dependent on the half-life of the nuclide,
   elemental measurements can be optimized by varying the irradiation and
   the decay times (i.e., how long the sample is near a neutron source and
   when the sample is counted).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Procedure

   The most common procedure for NAA involves encapsulating the samples
   and suitable standards in heat-sealed polyethylene or quartz vials and
   simultaneously irradiating them.  Ideally, the samples are irradiated
   in a "lazy susan" facility that revolves around the core thereby
   insuring that the samples and standards experience the same neutron
   fluence. Following sequential decay periods, each standard sample is
   counted utilizing high resolution germanium detectors coupled to a
   multi-channel analyzer system. Such counting of samples over sequential
   decay periods optimizes the determination of 35 to 50 elements in
   various types of samples. The analyzer system converts the signals that
   result from gamma-ray photons impinging the detector into digital
   electronic pulses. Gamma-ray counts accumulated in an energy region
   above the background counts produce photo peaks. After counting is
   complete, these data are processed using sophisticated computer
   programs that smooth the spectral data and determine the net areas of
   gamma-ray photo peaks and translates the area into count rates (counts
   per minute or cpm). These programs are capable of resolving overlapping
   and complex photopeak energy regions. Additional data for decay time
   differences, electronic dead time losses and unresolved interferences
   and compares the sample data (cpm/weight) to the standard data (cpm/ug)
   to calculate elemental abundance in the sample.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Errors in Analysis

   The principal error in the analysis of materials by NAA is the counting
   statistic error, which is based on the signal to background ratio at
   the gamma-ray energy region of interest. A one sigma error for a photo
   peak area determination is approximately equal to the square root of
   the total counts (background plus net counts) divided by the net
   counts. For example, a peak area determination with 2000 total counts
   and a net area of 1000 counts produces a counting error of about 4.5%.
   An additional source of error for some elemental determinations is due
   to unresolved interferences. The most serious interferences are those
   that result when identical radio nuclides are produced from different
   nuclear reactions. For example, high concentrations of U fission
   products can interfere with the accurate determination of La, Ce, Nd,
   Mo, and Zr abundances. In addition, the determinations of some elements
   can suffer because the photo peaks produced by gamma-rays emitted by
   two or more radio nuclides is not readily resolved. In these cases,
   empirical corrections are integrated into the data reduction procedure.
   Self-shielding is a phenomenon that occurs when the neutron flux
   experienced by a sample is attenuated, thereby reducing the neutron
   activation of the nuclides in self-shielded samples. This effect occurs
   when a sample contains extremely high concentrations of elements with
   very high probabilities that a neutron will be captured, which is
   measured in terms of a cross section.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Detection Limits

   Elemental detection limits for NAA are variable because the production
   of radioactive nuclides depends on the cross section of a specific
   element. Also important is the number of gamma-rays that are emitted by
   a radio nuclide. In some cases, only a small fraction of the total
   emissions from a specific nuclide is in the form of gamma-rays. In
   general, elements that have large cross sections will have low
   detection limits. Detection limits are also matrix dependent. Samples
   with high concentrations of elements that are readily activated and
   emit a considerable number of gamma-rays, such as Na and Sc, can
   generate high background count rates and raise the detection limits.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Applications

   Neutron activation analysis remains at the forefront of techniques for
   the quantitative multi-element analyses of major, minor and trace
   elements in hundreds of different types of materials. The following
   list includes some of the materials that can be readily analyzed by
   NAA:

   Instrumental Neutron activation analysis (INAA) is a non-destructive,
   highly precise and accurate analytical technique capable of determining
   up to 48 elements in almost all types of sample matrices. The INAA
   procedure involves irradiating samples and appropriate standard
   reference materials with neutrons in the GSTR to produce unstable
   radioactive nuclides. Many of these radio nuclides emit gamma-rays with
   characteristic energies that can be measured utilizing high-resolution
   semiconductor detectors. The rate that the gamma-rays are emitted from
   an element in the sample is directly proportional to its concentration.
   Samples as small as 1 mg can be quantitatively measured by INAA.
   Detection limits are in the parts per million to parts per billion
   range depending on the element and sample matrix.
