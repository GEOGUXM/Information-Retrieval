             Data Usage on the USGS Spatial Data Delivery Web Site

   The Mineral Resources Program (MRP) of the U.S. Geological Survey
   maintains an Internet web site to provide public access to various
   forms of digital data. Digital data sets include geology, geochemistry,
   geophysics, mineral resources, base maps, and other data. Coverage
   varies from regional to global. We present these data in an interactive
   map-based format that allows the user to create individualized maps by
   selecting data sets and map areas.

   The MRP invites participation from other governmental agencies in
   supplying data to this web site. Because there have been questions in
   the past concerning ownership and publication rights to digital data
   sets, the MRP issues this policy statement, which covers all data
   presented on the web site.

What Users Will Be Allowed To Do:

   ·       Display all data sets on screen at scales that are appropriate
   to the data set.

   ·       Overlay data sets in any combination.

   ·       Print simplified explanations (symbols and short descriptions)
   for all data sets.

   ·       Print small-scale (page-sized) renditions of maps containing
   any combination of data sets.

   ·       Download plot files to plot maps containing any combination of
   data sets at user-specified scales.

   ·       Query all data sets.

   ·       Download portions of data sets that are freely available to the
   public.

What Users Will Not Be Allowed To Do:

   ·       Download any data set or portion thereof which is not freely
   available to the public.

What MRP Will Do:

   ·       Provide public access to digital data sets produced by MRP and
   related data sets from other sources.

   ·       Provide links to other agencies for user access to data sets
   that are not freely available to the public.

What MRP Will Not Do:

   ·       MRP will not sell or give away any data sets that are not
   freely available to the public.

   We believe that there is an opportunity for cooperation and synergism
   in this activity. We can offer a single location where users can come
   to create relatively simple individualized maps and to browse for
   geoscience-related digital data sets. Users who have needs that are
   more complex than can be accommodated on the MRP web site will be able
   to download freely available data for local use. For privately held
   data sets, we will provide visibility and links to sources for those
   data sets.
