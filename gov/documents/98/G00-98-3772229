                         About the debt calculation

     The national debt clock on this page provides an accurate,
     up-to-the-second estimate of the total U.S. national debt based on
     data retreived daily from the U.S. Treasury Department's Bureau of
     the Public Debt.
     Occasionally, you may notice the estimate of the debt grow smaller.
     This occurs because the selling of treasury notes occasionally
     results in a short-term reduction in the national debt.
     Last year, the U.S. spent $343 billion in interest on the national
     debt alone, accounting for one-fifth of all government spending.
