   If you work for an environmental agency and are interested in a
   voluntary environmental program that encourages businesses not only to
   comply with regulations but to go beyond them, you have come to the
   right place.


   The Bay Area Green Business Program
   is a cooperative regional effort that assists businesses and government
   agencies to come into full compliance with environmental regulations,
   and take steps to prevent pollution and conserve resources. Green
   businesses and public agencies receive certificates and may display the
   Green Business logo on their premises and in their advertising. The
   Green Business Program markets the logo so that consumers can identify
   environmentally responsible businesses. The public's growing
   environmental awareness represents purchasing power that can motivate
   businesses to become "green."

   The Bay Area Green Business Program was developed by the Bay Area
   Hazardous Waste Management Facility Allocation Committee of the
   Association of Bay Area Governments. The committee championed the
   program as a way to reduce hazardous waste generation in the nine Bay
   Area counties. The Green Business Program works to lower generation
   rates by providing businesses with clear consolidated information on:
     * how to comply with environmental regulations (including those
       pertaining to air quality, wastewater discharge, storm water
       management, chemical storage and handling, and hazardous waste
       management); and

     * how to go beyond those regulations to adopt environmentally-sound
       business practices in four areas - energy efficiency, water
       conservation, and solid and hazardous waste reduction


   Motivated to Be Green
   Until recently, most federal and state environmental initiatives
   targeted big businesses. The Bay Area Green Business Program initially
   chose to work with small and medium-sized businesses - auto repair,
   printing/graphic arts, and wineries. Small operators do not have
   dedicated environmental specialists on staff and are often not in a
   position to hire consultants. They tend to avoid seeking help from
   government and therefore miss opportunities to run
   environmentally-friendly operations. As the Green Business Program
   matures, participants are expanding the program to all interested
   businesses. The Bay Area Green Business Program motivates business
   participation in three ways. The Program:

     * Offers businesses the opportunity to develop a positive, proactive
       relationship with environmental regulators who provide regulatory
       and pollution prevention expertise.
     * Coordinates inspections so that the businesses receive consistent
       rather than conflicting information. Program-developed checklists
       cover all regulatory concerns that may apply.
     * The Green Business Program promotes the program and the Green
       Business logo to the public. Green businesses are recognized for
       their efforts. They receive a certificate and a window decal that
       displays the Green Business logo once they meet program standards.
       They may use the program logo in their advertising.


   Green Five Years and Counting
   The Bay Area Green Business Program was formally launched in 1996. The
   Program combined the successful compliance - only Sonoma Green Business
   Program model with the Pollution Prevention and Resource Conservation
   standards developed by Santa Clara County. Initial outreach was to auto
   repair shops in Alameda and Napa Counties. Alameda County subsequently
   extended the program to printers, hotels and restaurants and now works
   with all businesses. Contra Costa County began offering the program to
   auto repair shops in 1998, and extended it to printers in 2000. In
   2002, Contra Costa County will also open the program to all businesses.
   Sonoma County added wineries and printers to their program in 1999.
   Santa Clara launched its program to all interested businesses in 1999.
   Marin County initiated program development in 2001 and expects to offer
   certification to qualified businesses in 2002. Since program inception,
   more than 160 businesses have been certified green and the pace is
   accelerating.

   Green Business partners are working to achieve the following by the
   year 2001:
     * Recognize 200 auto repair shops;

     * Offer the program to more industries;

     * Develop and implement a regional marketing campaign to encourage
       the public to shop "green";

     * Distribute comprehensive environmental information to businesses;
       and

     * Expand the Program so that it is available in six Bay Area
       counties.
