   Self-Help Plan June 1999 UCRL-MA-135314 Summary For all personnel, when
   evacuating your building: * Exit in a safe and orderly fashion. * Leave
   your building, trailer or work area promptly, using the shortest route
   possible. * Take mental notes of problems or unusual conditions as you
   leave your area. * Report to the appropriate Assembly Point and give
   your name. * Follow instructions from the Assembly Point Leader. F - 6
   Environmental Restoration Division Self-Help Plan June 1999
   UCRL-MA-135314 Purpose In a major disaster, such as an earthquake,
   toxic chemical release, or fire, this Self-Help Plan can be used in
   combination with good judgment to reduce the risk of injury to
   personnel and minimize property damage in our laboratory and office
   areas. Additionally, in following this procedure we will be able to;
   account for all personnel who have been safely evacuated; determine
   whether or not anyone is trapped or left in the buildings for some
   other reason; render appropriate first-aid to the injured; properly
   arrange for transport to medical facilities of those more seriously
   injured; inform personnel of relevant conditions prior to discharge
   from the laboratory. These emergency procedures apply to all personnel
   including visitors and program contract personnel working in T-4302,
   T-4316, T-4377, T-4378, T-4383, T-4384, T-4386, T-4387, B-011, B-042,
   B-187, B-406, B-438, B-472, B-597 and all Portable Treatment Units
   (PTUs). See Appendix B for evacuation routes, Assembly Point locations,
   and Responsible Personnel for these areas. In the event of an
   emergency, you need to be aware of assembly point locations. Roles And
   Responsibilities Every person in T-4302, T-4316, T-4377, T-4378,
   T-4383, T-4384, T-4386, T-4387, B-011, B-042, B-187, B-406, B-438,
   B-472, B-597, and all PTU's has a role to perform in preparation for
   and during an emergency. In each facility, the Supervisor, an
   alternate, and at least one other individual must be knowledgeable
   about all utilities (gas, electric, water) within the area and the
   switches and/or procedures to secure/deactivate them. Appendix-D lists
   the ERD individuals who have been assigned specific Self-Help
   responsibilities. A description of the assigned roles and
   responsibilities of Self-Help personnel follows. Emergency Preparedness

   Remain at Assembly Point for further instructions. F - 9 Environmental
   Restoration Division Self-Help Plan June 1999 UCRL-MA-135314 Emergency
   Supplies And Equipment Equipment and supplies required to perform
   search/rescue, first-aid/CPR treatment, utility shutdown, and other
   Assembly Point functions are to be stored in a locked and protected
   locker at each Assembly Point and to be readily accessible in the event
   of an emergency. The emergency supplies listed in Appendix-F, are to be
   maintained in sufficient quantities to accommodate anticipated needs.
   The APL is responsible for the supplies in the locker at the respective
   Assembly Point. The APL is also responsible for assuring that a
   quarterly inventory is performed and a written record is kept of the
   inventory. A copy of the inventory list is to be located in the
   emergency supply locker. The APL is assigned to inspect the emergency
   supplies regularly (i.e., at least quarterly) to make sure that the log
   is current and the equipment and supplies remain in useable condition.
   Communications Communications are necessary during an emergency to
   provide orderly assistance and direction to personnel. During an
   emergency it is particularly important to restrict communications to
   essential traffic. All communication must be clear, accurate and
   concise. Methods for communicating emergency information are available.
   These methods include: * laboratory emergency radio 1610 AM or KKIQ
   101.7 FM * emergency public address (PA) system * telephones * radio
   pagers, radio transceivers * horns, sirens, klaxons * portable
   loudspeakers, megaphones * runners In addition, the Radio Amateur
   Communications Emergency System (RACES), a network of employee radio
   operators, is organized to supplement normal communications when
   required by the Self-Help Program. The following considerations and
   restrictions apply to these methods of communications in a major
   emergency: Emergency PA System Follow the instructions that may be
   given over the LLNL emergency PA system. If you are told to evacuate
   the building, go to the designated Assembly Point and wait for
   instructions. In the event of a major earthquake in the Bay Area, the
   Laboratory will attempt to advise employees over the PA system about
   road conditions and general status. F - 10 Environmental Restoration
   Division Self-Help Plan June 1999 UCRL-MA-135314 Telephones Avoid
   overloading the telephone system during major emergencies. Use the
   telephone only for reporting emergencies. Horns, Sirens, Klaxons
   Emergency Signals given by horns, sirens, or klaxons are listed in the
   LLNL phone book. Everyone is urged to review these signals
   periodically. Portable Loudspeakers and Megaphones At the discretion of
   the Assembly Point Leader, a power amplified megaphone may be used for
   communication within the Assembly Point. Runners Runners are to be used
   for communications between the Assembly Point Leader and Zone
   Supervisor, particularly when problems are encountered with the radio
   transceiver network. The APL will appoint personnel as needed for this
   purpose. Evacuation When the conditions in a major emergency justify
   evacuation, notification will be given by means of an announcement over
   the LLNL Emergency PA system. The announcement is to be preceded by an
   emergency signal consisting of a steady blast or tone lasting for three
   to five minutes. If an order is given to evacuate, everyone in T-4302,
   T-4316, T-4377, T-4378, T-4383, T-4384, T- 4386, T-4387, B-011, B-042,
   B-187, B-406, B-438, B-472, B-597, and each PTU is to stop ongoing
   operations safely and then quickly proceed to their assigned Assembly
   Points using the established evacuation routes. Routes and Locations
   Diagrams of the evacuation routes and assembly point locations are to
   be maintained and conspicuously posted in each facility. A map showing
   the locations of the ERD Assembly Points is provided as Appendix-B. If
   the specified location becomes unsuitable, then the APL is to designate
   an alternate site. Visitors and Others Support personnel assigned to a
   given facility are to go to the Assembly Point designated for that
   facility. Visitors and contract personnel are to be directed to the
   Assembly Point designated for the responsible facility. Handicapped and
   Injured Personnel are urged to assist handicapped individuals during
   the evacuation. Injured individuals should also be helped to move out
   of potentially hazardous areas if this can be done without undue risk
   of additional injury. F - 11 Environmental Restoration Division
   Self-Help Plan June 1999 UCRL-MA-135314 Reporting At the Assembly
   Point, personnel are to report to their APL and remain there until
   otherwise instructed. Similarly, the Self-Help communication chain is
   to be established between the APL and the ZS. Additional information
   and instructions for each level in the various Zones are specified in
   the body and appendices of this plan (see Table of Contents). Personnel
   Accountability DOE requires provisions to account for all on-site
   personnel within a reasonable length of time after determination of an
   emergency and continually thereafter as long as the emergency exists.
   What is considered a "reasonable" length of time varies depending on
   the location and activity (30 minutes is considered typical). One of
   the two following systems is required for all self-help plans: Roll
   Call System  a full-time, reliable, muster accountability system that
   records movement of all personnel to and from a facility or area.
   Although this is the preferred system, it is feasible in only a few
   LLNL facilities, such as the firing areas at Site 300. Exception System
   A system of accounting for personnel who have evacuated to an Assembly
   Point and by performing a thorough search of all areas of a facility.
   The search process is based on trained, Re-Entry/First-Aid Teams. It is
   the responsibility of the APL to initiate, coordinate, and ensure the
   effectiveness of the personnel accounting process. For additional
   considerations regarding sweeps and re-entry, refer to Section:
   RE-ENTRY/RE- OCCUPANCY and Appendix-D, List of ERD Self Help Personnel.
   Some emergency situations may DELAY OR PROHIBIT a search by the
   Re-Entry/First-Aid Team; i.e., building collapse, fire, etc...In this
   situation, the APL will perform a roll call and will query assembled
   personnel to determine the probability of personnel remaining in the
   facility/area. If there are missing/unaccounted-for personnel, the APL
   is to notify the ZS of the situation and request instructions.
   Transportation Taxis Transporting injured personnel by taxi is
   encouraged during a major emergency when ambulances may not be readily
   available. Government Vehicles Government vehicles may be used to
   transport injured people. Extra vehicle keys are to be maintained in
   the Assembly Point Locker. Government vehicles may also be used in the
   care and treatment of injured personnel to protect them from the
   elements. Private Vehicles Because of insurance limitations, private
   vehicles should not be used to transport injured personnel. F - 12
   Environmental Restoration Division Self-Help Plan June 1999
   UCRL-MA-135314 Re-Entry/Re-Occupancy After a major emergency resulting
   in an evacuation, the re-entry/re-occupancy of T-4302, T-4316, T-4377,
   T-4378, T-4383, T-4384, T-4386, T-4387, B-011, B-042, B-187, B-406,
   B-438, B-472, B- 597 areas and all PTUs are subject to the following
   considerations and stipulations: Key Code: ERD office keys have been
   color-coded in order to expedite matching individual keys to offices.
   Keys have been identified using various colors of tape. Offices have
   strips of tape of various colors on the door jam above each office
   door. Matching the color of tape on a key with the color of tape above
   an office precludes matching keys to doors by number. The key with no
   tape is the "GX92" key which opens all ERD buildings and all offices
   with no tape above the doors. Access Control and Restrictions Besides
   the normal Safeguards and Security Department requirements and
   procedures, the ZS or the Hazards Control Safety Team Leader may impose
   additional access controls and/or restrictions. Access for authorized
   search/rescue and damage control personnel will be at the discretion of
   the APL and/or ZS. Assessment Re-Entry/First-Aid Teams will be deployed
   to provide an initial assessment of the situation. Re- Entry/First-Aid
   Teams organized and trained for each Assembly Point are identified in
   Appendix- D, ERD Self-Help Personnel. All facilities require inspection
   by knowledgeable personnel before being re-occupied. If local personnel
   are unable to establish that a building is safe for re-occupancy, Plant
   Engineering is to be contacted to provide a damage assessment team.
   Approval to Re-Occupy Facility re-occupancy is to be undertaken only
   when it is safe to do so and expressly by the ZS through the APL.
   Training Self-Help personnel will receive specialized training for the
   specific assignment as shown in the table below: It is mandatory to
   keep this training current and up-to-date. Title Required Course Title

   First-Aid HS1620 While not required, it is useful to have a number of
   additional trained personnel to perform emergency duties. It is the
   responsibility of line organization supervisors to: * Encourage
   personnel to take classes that would be valuable to others during an
   emergency. Basic first-aid and CPR are highly recommended. * Maintain
   records of specially trained personnel whose services could be applied
   in the event of an emergency. Exercises DOE prescribes conducting of
   tests and exercises under simulated conditions for the identified
   credible emergencies at LLNL. To comply, an annual exercise is
   performed at Livermore and Site 300 with all personnel and facilities
   participating. APLs are encouraged to conduct additional exercises for
   their personnel as appropriate. Plan Review & Update This Self-Help
   Plan is organized to generally follow the guidelines provided in the
   LLNL Emergency Preparedness Plan. It is assembled in loose-leaf form to
   facilitate keeping its individual components updated. The ERD Facility
   Manager is assigned oversight responsibility for review and
   coordination of this plan in conjunction with the LLNL Emergency
   Preparedness Manager who has oversight responsibility for all LLNL
   Self-Help Plans. This plan is to be reviewed and updated as needed to
   ensure its effectiveness by incorporating constructive input from
   appropriate ERD personnel, as well as from external reviewers, such as
   Hazards Control, Safeguards & Security. All those affected are urged to
   contribute updates/corrections, criticisms, observations, etc. Input
   based on experiences and observations during emergencies and emergency
   exercises is particularly useful. Please make your contributions
   through administrative channels or directly to the ERD Facility
   Manager. Management Review In compliance with the LLNL Emergency
   Preparedness Plan, this Self-Help Plan is to undergo (at least
   annually) a "documented" review, with approvals by the responsible
   Facility Manager and Department Head. F - 14 Environmental Restoration
