    The Solar-Terrestrial Physics division of the National Geophysical Data
    Center is the focal point for data pertaining to solar activity, the
    ionosphere, and geomagnetic variations. The Solar and Upper Atmospheric Data
    Services group handles, archives and distributes solar data from the
    following disciplines:

     * Solar and Interplanetary Phenomena
     * Flare- Associated Events
     * Cosmic Rays
     * Solar Publications

   We are interested in the sun because of the many influences it has on
   our lives and our environment. Aside from the many aspects of purely
   scientific research, there are numerous environmental influences caused
   by the sun. Beyond the obvious considerations of heat and light, some
   examples of these direct and indirect solar influences are the effects
   on short-wave radio communications, navigation, use of satellites for
   communication and navigation, hazards to humans and instruments in
   space, electrical power transmission, geomagnetic prospecting, gas
   pipeline monitoring, and possibly weather and human and animal
   behaviour.

    We offer most of our digital data sets via anonymous FTP.

   We offer data on-line via the SPIDR (Space Physics Interactive Data
   Resource) data delivery and browse system. Click here to enter the
   SPIDR system.

Announcements:

     * Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN) 1-second data is now on SPIDR!
       Click here. Data is continually being added, but due to the size of
       the database only certain dates are currently on-line.
     * Cosmic Rays are now on SPIDR! Click here to find out more.
     INTERNATIONAL GEOPHYSICAL CALENDARS - Click here to download the
       final 1998 International Geophysical Calendar in postscript format,
       GIF format, or in PDF. The 1997 International geophysical Calendar
       is also available in in postscript format, GIF format or in PDF.
       More information about the calendar can be found here, or on our
       FTP archive. Click here to find more information about ISES.
     * Solar Databases for Global Change Models paper on-line. Gives
       information about the Sun and how it affects our Earth and
       near-Earth environment. Also gives good information about our FTP
       archive and brief description of on-line data.
     * The Solar Group is offering a multi-discipline CD-ROM set, titled
       Solar Variability Affecting Earth. To find out more about the
       CD-ROM set, please click here.
     * Digital solar synoptic charts for the years 1966-1987 are currently
       available through the Data Center. For more information, click
       here.
     * A complete listing of all the UAG Reports is on-line. To see this
       list, click here.
     * To see a listing of historical solar observations available on
       microfilm, please click here.
     * To view a listing of some of our more popular and extensive solar
       indices data products, please click here.
