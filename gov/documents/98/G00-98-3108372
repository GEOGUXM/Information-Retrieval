                    Non-Radioactive Air Emissions at LANL

   This portion of the air emissions monitoring program is limited, since
       under the Clean Air Act the Laboratory is classified as a small
   quantity generator for air emissions or is exempt due to the age of our
                                 facilities.

   We perform engineering calculations to estimate emissions for a number
    of specific air pollutants (New Mexico 2.73 Emissions Inventory) and
   publish annual reports. Data may be updated more recently, as shown on
    each data page. The Laboratory has the potential to emit 100 tons per
      year of suspended particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx),
   carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). For 1997,
       combustion products from the industrial sources contributed the
       greatest amount of regulated air emissions from the Laboratory.
   Research and development activities contributed the greatest amount of
   VOCs. Emissions of beryllium and aluminum were reported for activities
             permitted under 20 NMAC 2.72, Construction Permits.

    We also do a limited amount of actual stack emissions monitoring for
   non-radioactive species. An initial description of our stack monitoring
    program at our permitted beryllium facility will be included here in
                              the near future.
