   September 18, 1998 Mars moon Phobos hip-deep in powder By DIANE
   AINSWORTH New temperature data and close-up images of the Martian moon
   Phobos gathered by JPL's Mars Global Surveyor indicate the surface of
   this small body has been pounded into powder by eons of meteoroid
   impacts, some of which started landslides that left dark trails marking
   the steep slopes of giant craters. New temperature measurements show
   the surface must be composed largely of finely ground powder at least
   one meter (three feet) thick, accord- ing to scientists studying
   infrared data from the thermal emission spectrome- ter instrument on
   the spacecraft. Measurements of the day and night sides of Phobos show
   such extreme temperature variations that the sunlit side of the moon
   rivals a pleasant winter day in Chicago, while only a few kilometers
   away, on the dark side of the moon, the climate is more harsh than a
   night in Antarctica. High temperatures for Phobos were measured at
   minus 4 degrees Celsius (25 degrees F) and lows at minus 112 Celsius
   (minus 170 degrees F). The extremely fast heat loss from day to night
   as Phobos turns in its seven-hour rotation can be explained if hip-deep
   dust covers its surface, said Dr. Philip Christensen of Arizona State
   University, principal investi- gator for the experiment on Global
   Surveyor. "The infrared data tells us that Phobos, which does not have
   an atmosphere to hold heat in during the night, probably has a surface
   composed of very small particles that lose their heat rapidly once the
   Sun has set," Christensen Temperatures are shown as recorded on the
