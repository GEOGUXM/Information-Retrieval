   Cancer Prevention Models
   The Animal Models for Cancer Prevention (Prevention Models) Focus Group
   has been formed to enhance research using transgenic or null mice as
   well as other animal models that can provide insight into genes whose
   activity drives carcinogenesis and genes whose activity may be targeted
   to prevent carcinogenesis at any stage. Small-molecule drug or dietary
   inhibitors as well as vaccines and gene therapy reagents are of
   interest. Prevention Models subgroups are focusing on:

     * emerging technologies
     * comparative intervention
     * molecular targets for cancer prevention

   Prevention Models members are contributing to the NCI-wide database of
   mouse models and advocate the generation of new mice and new tools that
   will facilitate the discovery and validation of prevention targets.
