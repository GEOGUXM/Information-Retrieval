ProStar Concept

   The idea of ProStar -- PROtein STructure ARchive, was born in the
       aftermath of the first Asilomar Conference on the Critical
       Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction in
       December 1994, where long discussions r/evolved around the problem
       of establishing criteria for an objective assessment of the
       performance of prediction methods.
       The concept of Prostar includes:

     * How well can present potentials discriminate between correct and
       incorrect protein structures?
     * Is there a cost in discrimination in simplifying the structural
       description of a protein?
     * What is the best reference state to use?
     * What sorts of approximation representation of different terms -
       hydrophobic, electrostatic solvation, hydrogen bonds... are
       effective in potentials?
     * How complicated must a potential be?
     * What is the underlying physics of the hydrophobic effect and
       secondary structure preference?
     * Where can future effort in potential development be most
       effectively focused?

     This site aims to address these and other questions about potentials
     for protein structure prediction. The strategy is simple:
    1. Collect examples of right and wrong structures from the prediction
       community.
    2. Collect results of different potentials operating on these
       examples.
    3. Provide mechanisms for effective discussion of the significance of
       the results.

ProStar Service

   Decoys
       ProStar provides a variety of decoys to test potential functions
       used in protein structure evaluation.
       Total decoys were divided into sepetated decoy sets based on their
       origin and characteristics. Each decoy set was stored in an
       independent directory in the disk named exactly by the decoy set
       name. A decoy set usually consists of a couple of crystal
       structures and decoy structures. Each structure is identified by a
       decoy set name and a decoy ID, which are shown at the beginning two
       lines of the PDB coordinates file with the keyword of DECSET and
       DECID. The decoy ID of the crystal structures start with "CRYSTAL".
       Currently, the majority of decoys is based on work done in our
       group. Some sets were derived from publicly available sources or
       provided by other people, groups and institutions. We want to thank
       all contributors and encourage further contributions and
       suggestions. Detailed information about each decoy set and medline
       reference is also provided.
       Many current potentials are in one or another way parameterized
       utilizing information from experimental protein structures. As a
       basis for standardizing the structural information contained in a
       potential we also provide standard libraries of experimental
       structures.
       We do our best to ensure 'clean' data sets, i.e. complete
       sidechains, ASN/GLN sidechain O/N assignments, unique sidechain
       conformation, etc. (see submit decoys). We greatly appreciate any
       help we can get on this clean-up. So, if you find a problem in one
       of the structures, please tell us.
       Potentials
       ProStar provides a unique database of Potential functions. It has
       comprehensive information on the present popular potential
       functions, including their principles, references, and very
       conveniently, medline links etc. To make it more useful to the
       protein folding community, many of the energy functions have source
       codes. You are encouraged to contribute your potential source code
       to this site.
       Potential evaluation
       ProStar review the test results of the potentials on the structure
       decoys. At present, we use two evaluation protocols:

     * DISCRIMINATED
     * LOG PROB

   We also provide a simple and straightforward form to evaluate and
   compare the performance of different potentials in different decoys. In
   the form, first, you highlight the potentials you want to evaluate, and
   second highlight the decoy sets you want to test, third, select the
   result display order sorted by either potential names or decoy set
   names, finally, click DISPLAY button to get the result.

   The result will be shown in a bar chart. The height of the bar
   represents the summary score of a potential tested on a decoy set using
   a specific evaluation method. You can click the relevant links on the
   chart to get further information on what kind of potential, decoy or
   evaluation method are used. You can also click INDIVIDUAL SCORES to get
   all the detailed individual scores of this potential on this decoy set.

   Any suggestions of improvements or changes to the current evaluation
   protocols or of alternative or additional protocols are very welcome.

  Submission

   The Site will only be successful if all the people in the field
   contribute to it!

   ProStar need you to submit your own decoys, potentials and test results
   to this web site. To make the process of your submission as quick as
   possible, ProStar provides some fundamental format.
