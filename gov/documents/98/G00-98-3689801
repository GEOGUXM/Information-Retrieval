   Getting Started

      The NASA Commercial Technology Network (NCTN) encompasses over 20 Web
      sites operated by NASA's national network of programs, centers and
      offices sponsored by, and affiliated with, the Commercial Technology
      Division at NASA Headquarters. These include the Commercial Technology
      offices at the 10 NASA field centers, the NASA Regional Technology
      Transfer Centers (RTTCs), the National Technology Transfer Center, NASA
      Tech Briefs, COSMIC, UNISPHERE, and other specialized organizations and
      services dedicated to fostering dual-use technology partnerships, and
      the transfer and commercialization of NASA-sponsored research and
      technology.

      NCTN provides access to a wide array of information resources that can
      be searched and consulted for research and technology, patents,
      technical expertise, and R&D facilities as well as for technology
      partnering, licensing and commercialization opportunities. In addition
      to serving as an integrated information resource, the NCTN is
      developing into an electronic marketplace for NASA-sponsored
      technology, facilitating communications, transactions and partnerships
      between NASA and the U.S. private sector.

      This site -- operated by the Commercial Technology Division -- serves
      as a gateway and core resource for the NCTN. The NASA Electronic
      Commerce/Networking team is responsible for the operation and
      development of the network. For further information on this site, the
      team and the NCTN, contact Jonathan Root.

   Check out What's New for NASA technology transfer and commercialization
   highlights and events, selected technology opportunities, and featured
   web resources of the NCTN.

   Service Directory
   Consult the Service Directory to access NASA's national network of
   programs, organizations and services dedicated to technology transfer
   and commercialization. The directory provides links to the sites of the
   NASA Commercial Technology Network, which offer a wealth of technology
   resources available to U.S. enterprises, highlight opportunities and
   services for technology partnering, licensing and commercialization,
   and much more!

   Technology Resources
   You are invited to explore the nation's past and current investment in
   NASA programs to discover research, technology, scientific/technical
   expertise and R&D capabilities that match the needs and interests of
   your enterprise. Technology Resources include searchable publications
   and databases that provide current and archived information on NASA
   research, technology and capabilities that may be utilized and
   leveraged to launch new products, services and enterprises, strengthen
   technological competitiveness, and bolster commercial success.

   Since NASA's inception in 1958, the agency's aeronautical and space
   programs have produced and sponsored advanced technology and pioneering
   research involving a broad range of scientific/technical fields and
   associated industries. The commercial application of this great wealth
   of innovation and knowledge has yielded -- and continues to generate --
   unprecedented dividends for U.S. commercial enterprises, economic
   growth and quality of life.

   Search and browse our Technology Resources to discover NASA solutions
   and opportunities for your enterprise, and contact the NASA Commercial
   Technology Network for technology transfer and commercialization
   assistance.

   Business Resources
   Technology transfer and commercialization requires expertise and
   resources in management,business planning, financing, market research,
   partnering and other business and marketplace factors critical to
   commercial success. Consult our collection Business Resources to aid
   your business development and commercialization efforts.

   Search
   Try out our powerful Search service to speed your exploration of NASA
   technology resources, and technology transfer / commercialization
   opportunities and services. Options include searching this site and/or
   selected sites of the NASA Commercial Technology Network.

   Small Business/SBIR
   Visit the NASA SBIR/STTR site to discover how NASA's Small Business
   Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer
   (STTR) programs can help your enterprise on the pathway to successful
   technology development and commercialization! The site provides
   comprehensive information on the two programs, which provide seed
   funding to U.S. small businesses and research institutions to produce
   scientific and technical innovations that address NASA R&D objectives
   and have commercial applications. The programs seek to promote the
   commercial application of federally-supported R&D, strengthen the role
   of small business in Federal R&D, and foster the participation by
   socially and economically disadvantaged persons and women-owned small
   businesses in technological innovation. The site also features the NASA
   SBIR/STTR Mall -- a growing resource for locating technologies and
   partners.

   Success Stories
   Looking for NASA spin-offs and commercial applications? Success Stories
   highlights recent examples of NASA technology transfer and
   commercialization, and provides links to the NASA Spinoff publication,
   and other searchable sources of past and current success stories. In
   addition to learning how others have put NASA technology to work, these
   resources are useful for locating commercially available products and
   services derived from NASA-sponsoredtechnology.

   For nearly forty years NASA has served as a prime source for much of
   the nation's innovation as a result of the agency's accomplishments in
   scientific research and technology development, and pioneering
   commitment to the secondary and commercial application of research and
   technology produced and sponsored by NASA programs. These spin-offs and
   applications of NASA technology are found throughout our daily lives,
   the U.S. economy and global marketplace, andcollectively represent a
   substantial dividend on the nation's investment in NASA.

   Building upon this rich heritage, NASA established the Commercial
   Technology Mission in 1994 to further strengthen its efforts to foster
   partnerships to develop technology for NASA missions and commercial
   purposes, and to facilitate the transfer and commercialization of
   NASA-funded research and technology. These efforts serve to stimulate
   new commercial enterprises and economic growth, strengthen the
   international competitiveness of U.S. industry, enhance our quality of
   life, and improve the effectiveness of NASA programs.
