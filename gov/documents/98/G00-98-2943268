   California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS)
   CalPERS is the nation's largest public pension fund, with assets
   exceeding $157 billion. It serves more than one million active and
   retired public employees, and provides services ranging from pension
   administration and home loans to medical and long-term care insurance.
   The system is administered by a 13-member board: six elected from the
   membership; three appointed - two by the Governor and one by the
   Speaker and Senate Rules Committee; and four statutory designated
   members who include the State Treasurer, the State Controller, the
   Director of the Department of Personnel Administration, and a member
   designated by the State Personnel Board.

   State Board of Control (SBC)
   The board is comprised of the Director of the Department of General
   Services as Chair, the State Controller as a member, and another member
   appointed by the Governor. The term of the Governor's appointee is four
   years, and the appointee does not require Senate confirmation. The
   three major programs administered by the board are the Victims of Crime
   (VOC) Program, the Revenue Recovery Compliance (RRC) Program, and the
   Government Claims (GC) Program. The VOC Program, the first victims'
   compensation program established in the United States, reimburses
   victims for certain expenses incurred as a direct result of a crime,
   including mental health counseling and medical expenses. The RRC
   Program works to ensure that statutorily mandated restitution fines and
   orders are imposed and collected from all offenders guilty of
   misdemeanors and felonies. The GC Program processes civil claims for
   money or damages filed against the state and presents claim
   recommendations to the board regarding potential claim settlements.

   State Personnel Board (SPB)

   SPB was constitutionally established in 1934 and given broad authority
   to administer the state civil service statutes established by the
   Legislature. The board provides a variety of recruitment, selection,
   classification, appellate, goal setting, training, and consultation
   services to state departments. It is led by a five-member board
   appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate for 10-year
   terms. Meeting bimonthly, the five-member board is responsible for
   establishing and altering classifications, adopting personnel rules and
   policies, administering the selection plan, resolving disciplinary and
   merit-related examination and appointment appeals, resolving
   discrimination and whistle blower complaints, as well as citizen and
   employee requests for disciplinary actions against state employees.

   California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS)
   CalSTRS is also one of the largest public pension systems in the
   nation, with assets exceeding $70 billion. It offers services similar
   to CalPERS to 450,000 active and retired members in the educational
   community. CalSTRS is governed by a 12-member board that includes the
   State Treasurer, the State Controller, the Superintendent of Public
   Instruction, and the Director of Finance. The Governor appoints the
   eight remaining members to four-year terms, and they represent specific
   interests (e.g., classroom teachers, retired members, and the public).
