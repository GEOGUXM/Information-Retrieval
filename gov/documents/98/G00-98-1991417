                       Conservation/Preservation Program

   The Conservation/Preservation Program provides State funding for
   libraries and other organizations engaged in efforts to preserve
   deteriorating library research materials. The program was established
   as part of the landmark 1984 library legislation and was expanded in
   1986 and 1990. It is administered by the New York State Library's
   Division of Library Development.

   The purposes of the Conservation/Preservation program are to encourage
   the proper care and accessibility of research materials, to promote the
   use of development of guidelines and technical standards for
   conservation/preservation work, and to support the growth of local and
   cooperative activities within the context of emerging national
   preservation programs.
