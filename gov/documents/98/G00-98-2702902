FY 2002 FULL & OPEN COMPETITION OPPORTUNITIES

   Title: NAEP Contractor Team
   Reference: NAEP Team
   Acquisition Method: Full & Open Competition
   Abstract: The Department of Education (Department or ED) has determined
   that a team, consortium, or other collection (hereinafter referred to
   as a "team") of contractors may be necessary to fulfill our upcoming
   requirements. We feel this is the best approach for the reasons listed
   below, but we will consider all proposals received whether from a
   single entity, single with subs, or a team approach. ED relied on the
   following reasons in making this determination:

     * The Department does not expect one single offeror on its own to be
       able to offer a complete solution that addresses all aspects of the
       solicitation.
     * The Department sees a need to communicate with any resultant
       contractor(s) in a direct manner. Further, we think that this
       communication could be hampered by an award made to one prime
       contractor who has several subcontractors. To this end, the
       Department is considering awarding prime contracts to each member
       of the winning team.
     * The Department sees value in having a team provide an integrated
       solution to all aspects of the solicitation.
     * The Department sees reduced risks for both parties (ED and the
       contractors) by having a prime contract with each team member as
       opposed to one prime with several subcontractors.
     * The Department sees its task of contractor performance monitoring
       as both more efficient and more effective if the contractors we
       monitor are primes to us.

   The contractor team (or other prospective offeror) will have to address
   all of the following areas.

   Alliance Coordination:
   To ensure that coordination occurs among contractors on the team at
   appropriate points, and between the team and contractors working on
   other phases of NAEP; to maintain data useful in tracking the progress
   of the other contractors on the team; and to work with NCES in ensuring
   that smooth transitions are made between activities and tasks
   implemented by the separate contractors.

   Design Analysis and Reporting:
   To create a design plan for each assessment and special study; to
   propose assessment methods consistent with previous practices that
   ensure the reporting of valid results; to propose and study
   psychometric and statistical analyses compatible with previous NAEP
   methodology; to determine the data needed to meet the goals for
   reporting and how to provide the information; and to coordinate the
   design and writing of reports.

   Item Development:
   To work with the DAR contractor to develop the background variables,
   cognitive items, and scoring rubrics; to work with the MDS contractor
   to help implement scoring and the training of scorers; to conduct a
   field test of the items and rubrics; and to participate in reviews of
   items.

   Materials Distribution and Scoring:
   To prepare and package the assessment and all necessary auxiliary
   materials; to print an adequate number of all assessment booklets and
   questionnaires; to distribute materials to the test administrators for
   each school; to ship completed assessment materials to the scoring
   sites; to develop training and scoring materials; and to develop and
   implement up-to-date scoring systems.

   Sampling and Data Collection:
   To select representative samples; to prepare sample weights for NAEP
   assessments; and to collect data from representative samples of
   students for NAEP assessments and special studies.

   Web Operations and Maintenance:
   To acquire, develop, implement, and support Internet-related
   applications and services for NAEP and the NAEP contractors; to
   identify and deploy emerging technologies and new products to improve
   NAEP's offerings; and to ensure timely release of quality products and
   services using web technologies.

   We expect to post a Draft SOW in early February on FedBizOpps.

   Title: Development and Maintenance of the What Works Clearinghouse:
   Registry of Instructional Successes in Education (RISE)
   Solicitation Number: TBD
   Acquisition Method: Full & Open Competition
   Abstract: The Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) in
   the U. S. Department of Education expects to request proposals for the
   development and maintenance of a national registry of instructional
   successes in education (RISE). The RISE will be a national
   clearinghouse that documents "what works" in education in a multitude
   of topic areas. More specifically, it will be an easily accessible and
   searchable online database of effective instructional products,
   programs, and practices that enhance student academic outcomes or
   characteristics of educational systems known to affect student academic
   outcomes, as determined through reviews of scientifically rigorous
   research and evaluation studies documenting their worth. A core
   expectation of the Department is that the interventions in the RISE can
   be successfully adopted by a significant number of educational
   practitioners throughout the nation. Therefore the system designed
   under the contract must ensure that entries in the RISE have rigorously
   documented evidence of effectiveness in enhancing student academic
   outcomes, as well as high potential for transportability to many other
   settings. The RISE is also expected to include a registry of qualified
   organizations and individuals committed to implementing evaluations of
   instructional interventions that are consistent with the standards and
   criteria established for entry into the RISE.

   The Department anticipates that major tasks will include:
     * developing standards and criteria for reviews of studies, and a
       multidimensional grading system for rating the effectiveness of
       instructional products, programs and practices
     * conducting reviews of studies and of the scientific evidence
       supporting claims about the effectiveness of educational
       interventions in designated topic areas
     * developing and supporting an online system and databases for the
       registries
     * disseminating information on successful products, programs, and
       practices
     * developing and supporting a registry of qualified evaluators of
       instructional interventions
     * creating and supporting an expert technical group to provide
       planning and ongoing operational advice to the contractor

   Title: National Study of Faculty and Students (NSOFAS)
   Plan Number: ED-02-R-0008
   Acquisition Method: Full & Open Competition
   Abstract: The United States Department of Education has a requirement
   for a large, complex data collection. The National Study of Faculty and
   Students [NSoFaS] is designed to collect information on nationally
   representative samples of faculty, instructional staff and students.
   The study consists of two main components. The faculty and
   instructional staff component [Part A-NSoPF:2004] will be similar in
   scope to prior National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF) data
   collections. The student survey component [Part B-NPSaS:2004], will be
   similar to prior National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) data
   collections, plus include state-representative samples of students
   enrolled at public 2-year, public 4-year, and private not-for-profit
   4-year in 12 states. Data will be collected primarily via the web and
   include self-administered, telephone interview and web field work.
   Although different modes of collection are anticipated, the system will
   be web-based. This study will result in documented data files,
   electronic codebooks, data analysis systems, and
   tabulations/descriptive reports for each main component. The faculty
   and instructional staff component [Part A or NSoPF] will consist of a
   field test in 2002-03 of 150 institutions and 600 faculty and
   instructional staff, and a full-scale sample in 2003-04 of
   approximately 1,000 institutions and 35,000 faculty and instructional
   staff. Data will be collected from a nationally representative sample
   of faculty and instructional staff in 2- and 4-year (and above) public
   and private, not-for-profit colleges and universities that are Title IV
   eligible, degree-granting institutions in the 50 states and the
   District of Columbia. If additional funding becomes available, faculty
   and institutions in the private for-profit 4-year sector will be added
   to Part A. The student component [Part B or NPSaS] will consist of a
   field test in 2002-03 of about 150 institutions and approximately 1,000
   students and a full-scale sample in 2003-04 of about 1,500 institutions
   and 100,000 to 125,000 students. NPSaS is a comprehensive nationwide
   study of how students and their families pay for postsecondary
   education. It includes nationally representative samples of
   undergraduates, graduates, and first-professional students; students
   attending less-than-2-year institutions, community colleges, 4-year
   colleges, and major universities. For 2004, the sample will also
   include state-representative undergraduate student samples enrolled in
   public 2-year, public 4-year, and private not-for-profit 4-year
   institutions in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois,
   Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, and Texas.
   Students who receive financial aid and those who do not receive aid
   participate in NPSaS. Results of the study are used to help determine
   federal policy regarding student financial aid. Contact Elizabeth
   Cappel at (202) 401-3538.
