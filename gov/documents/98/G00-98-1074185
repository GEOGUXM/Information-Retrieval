   Press Releases
   For Immediate Release

   TRANSIT/VANPOOL RIDERS NOW CAN SAVE UP TO $480 PER YEAR WITH COMMUTER
   CHECK®
   Tax-free Monthly Benefit Increases From $65 to $100
   Due to changes in federal law taking effect January 1, 2002, commuters
   can now save up to $480 annually through the Commuter Check® transit
   voucher program. Employers save more on payroll taxes as well -- up to
   $120 per employee.
   Beginning January 1, the maximum benefit for tax-free transit rises
   from $65 to $100 per month. Commuter Check® is a "Qualified
   Transportation Fringe Benefit" under IRS Section 132(f). Previously,
   the law allowed employers to give employees up to $780 per year in
   Commuter Checks as a pre-tax payroll deduction or a tax-free employee
   benefit. The increase in the monthly cap to $100 allows employers to
   give employees up to $1,200 per year as a tax-free benefit and
   increases their annual per employee savings to about $120. (The
   estimated $480 in annual tax savings enjoyed by the average employee
   assumes that the $1,200 being directed to the Commuter Check® program
   would otherwise have been taxed at the going rate of around 40
   percent.)

   "After informing our employees about the new cap, people in the office
   were very excited, frankly. We think itís wonderful and only wished the
   cap was raised sooner," said Ruth Soderback of Trinity Capital
   Corporation in San Francisco. "The news is especially exciting for
   those who commute from the East Bay and the Peninsula. Itís a huge
   savings for them. Commuter Check® allows us to help reduce emissions
   and assists in saving our environment."
   Commuter Check® vouchers can be redeemed for transit passes, tickets
   and tokens and are accepted by all transit operators throughout the Bay
   Area, as well as vanpools. About 80,000 commuters currently receive
   Commuter Checks® at more than 3,200 Bay Area employers.
   Commuter Check is a national program that is sponsored in the Bay Area
   by MTC in conjunction with RIDES for Bay Area Commuters. For more
   information about Commuter Check call 800/559-7909, or visit
   www.commutercheck.com.
