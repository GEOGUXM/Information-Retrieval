    Interplanetary radio emission due to interaction between two coronal
                               mass ejections

                             and J.-L. Bougeret

                 Geophysical Research Letters in press, 2001

                                  Abstract

   We report on the detection of a new class of nonthermal radio emission
   due to the interaction between two coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The
   radio emission was detected by the Radio and Plasma Wave Experiment
   (WAVES) on board the Wind satellite, while the CMEs were observed by
   the white-light coronagraphs of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
   (SOHO) mission. There was no type II radio burst (metric or
   interplanetary) preceding the nonthermal emission. The radio emission
   occurred at a distance beyond 10 R from the Sun, where the two CMEs
   came in contact. Using H-alpha and EUV images, we found that the two
   CMEs were ejected roughly along the same path. We argue that the
   nonthermal electrons responsible for the new type of radio emission
   were accelerated due to reconnection between the two CMEs and/or due to
   the formation of a new shock at the time of the collision between the
   two CMEs.

        SPACE WEATHER STUDY USING COMBINED CORONAGRAPHIC AND IN SITU
                                OBSERVATIONS

                                N. Gopalswamy

                  Advances in Space Research in press, 2001

                                  Abstract

   Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) play an important role in space weather
   studies because of their ability to cause severe geoeffects, such as
   magnetic storms. Shocks driven by CMEs may also accelerate solar
   energetic particles. Prediction of the arrival of these CMEs is
   therefore of crucial importance for space weather applications. After a
   brief review of the prediction models currently available, a
   description of an empirical model to predict the 1 AU arrival CMEs is
   provided. This model was developed using two-point measurements: (i)
   the initial speeds and onset times of Earth-directed CMEs obtained by
   white-light coronagraphs, and (ii) the corresponding interplanetary CME
   speeds and onset times at 1 AU obtained in situ. The measurements yield
   an empirical relationship between the interplanetary acceleration faced
   by the CMEs and their initial speeds, which forms the basis of the
   model. Use of archival data from spacecraft in quadrature is shown to
   refine the acceleration versus initial speed relationship, and hence
   the prediction model. A brief discussion on obtaining the 1-AU speed of
   CMEs from their initial speeds is provided. Possible improvements to
   the prediction model are also suggested.

                   Global picture of solar eruptive events

                                N. Gopalswamy

               Journal of Geophysical Research in press, 2001

                                  Abstract

   This introduction highlights some of the scientific results reported in
   this special section on solar eruptive events and provides a brief
   description of issues related to the new results. Most of these papers
   grew out of the coordinated data analysis workshop held at the Goddard
   Space Flight Center during April 27-30, 1999, and the subsequent
   International Conference on Solar Eruptive Events held at the Catholic
   University of America, Washington, D. C. during March 6-9, 2000.

          Near-Sun and near-Earth manifestations of solar eruptions

          N. Gopalswamy, A. Lara, M. L. Kaiser, and J.-L. Bougeret

               Journal of Geophysical Research in press, 2001

                                  Abstract

   We compare the near-Sun and near-Earth manifestations of solar
   eruptions that occurred during November 1994 to June 1998. We compared
   white-light coronal mass ejections, metric type II radio bursts, and
   extreme ultraviolet wave transients (near the Sun) with interplanetary
   (IP) signatures such as decameter-hectometric type II bursts,
   kilometric type II bursts, IP ejecta, and IP shocks. We did a two-way
   correlation study to (1) look for counterparts of metric type II bursts
   that occurred close to the central meridian and (2) look for solar
   counterparts of IP shocks and IP ejecta. We used data from Wind and
   Solar and Heliospheric Observatory missions along with metric radio
   burst data from ground-based solar observatories. Analysis shows that
   (1) most (93%) of the metric type II bursts did not have IP signatures,
   (2) most (80%) of the IP events (IP ejecta and shocks) did not have
   metric counterparts, and (3) a significant fraction (26%) of IP shocks
   were detected in situ without drivers. In all these cases the drivers
   (the coronal mass ejections) were ejected transverse to the Sun-Earth
   line, suggesting that the shocks have a much larger extent than the
   drivers. Shocks originating from both limbs of the Sun arrived at
   Earth, contradicting earlier claims that shocks from the west limb do
   not reach Earth. These shocks also had good type II radio burst
   association. We provide an explanation for the observed relation
   between metric, decameter-hectometric, and kilometric type II bursts
   based on the fast mode magnetosonic speed profile in the solar
   atmosphere.

           X-ray Ejecta, White Light CMEs and a Coronal Shock Wave

         N. Gopalswamy, O. C. St. Cyr, M. L. Kaiser, and S. Yashiro

                        Solar Physics in press, 2001

                                  Abstract

   We report on a coronal shock wave inferred from the metric type II
   burst of 1996 January 13. To identify the shock driver, we examined
   mass motions in the form of X-ray ejecta and white light coronal mass
   ejections (CMEs). None of the ejections could be considered fast (> 400
   km/s) events. In white light, two CMEs occurred in quick succession,
   with the first one associated with an X-ray ejecta near the solar
   surface. The second CME started at an unusually large height in the
   corona and carried a dark void in it. The first CME decelerated and
   stalled while the second one accelerated, both in the coronagraph field
   of view. We identify the X-ray ejecta to be the driver of the coronal
   shock inferred from metric type II burst. The shock speed reported in
   the Solar Geophysical Data (1000-2000 km/s) seems to be extremely large
   compared to the speeds inferred from X-ray and white light
   observations. We suggest that the MHD fast-mode speed in the inner
   corona is low enough that the X-ray ejecta is supermagnetosonic and
   hence can drive a shock to produce the type II burst.

       Characteristics of coronal mass ejections associated with long
                       wavelength type II radio bursts

                                  Bougeret

               Journal of Geophysical Research in press, 2001

                                  Abstract

   We investigated the characteristics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs)
   associated with long wavelength type II radio bursts in the near-Sun
   interplanetary medium. Type II radio bursts in the
   decameter-hectometric (DH) wavelengths indicate powerful MHD shocks
   leaving the inner solar corona and entering the interplanetary medium.
   Almost all of these bursts are associated with wider- and
   faster-than-average CMEs. A large fraction of these radio-rich CMEs
   were found to decelerate in the coronagraph field of view, in contrast
   to the prevailing view that most CMEs display either constant
   acceleration or constan t speed. We found a similar deceleration for
   the fast CMEs (speed > 900 km/s) in general. We suggest that the
   coronal dra g could be responsible for the deceleration, based on the
   result that the deceleration has a quadratic dependence on the CME
   speed. About 60% of the fast CMEs were not associated with DH type II
   bursts, suggesting that some additional condition needs to be sat
   isfied to be radio-rich. The average width (66°) of the radio-poor,
   fast CMEs is much smaller than that (102°) of the radio-rich CMEs,
   suggesting that the CME width pays an important role. The special
   characteristics of the radio-rich CMEs suggest th at the detection of
   DH radio bursts may provide a useful tool in identifying the population
   of geoeffective CMEs.

         Predicting the 1-AU Arrival Times of Coronal Mass Ejections

     N. Gopalswamy, A. Lara, S. Yashiro, M. L. Kaiser, and R. A. Howard

               Journal of Geophysical Research in press, 2001

                                  Abstract

   We describe an empirical model to predict the 1-AU arrival of coronal
   mass ejections (CMEs). This model is based on an effective
   interplanetary (IP) acceleration described in Gopalswamy et al. [2000b]
   that the CMEs are subject to, as they propagate from the Sun to 1 AU.
   We have improved this model (i) by minimizing the projection effects
   (using data from spacecraft in quadrature) in determining the initial
   speed of CMEs, and (ii) by allowing for the cessation of the
   interplanetary acceleration before 1 AU. The resulting effective IP
   acceleration was higher in magnitude than what was obtained from CME
   measurements from spacecraft along the Sun-Earth line. We evaluated the
   predictive capability of the CME arrival model using recent two-point
   measurements from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Wind
   and ACE spacecraft. We found that an acceleration cessation distance of
   0.76 AU is in reasonable agreement with the observations. The new
   prediction model reduces the average prediction error from 15.4 to 10.7
   hrs. The model is in good agreement with the observations for high
   speed CMEs. For slow CMEs, the model as well as observations show a
   flat arrival time of ~4.3 days. Use of quadrature observations
   minimized the projection effects naturally without the need to assume
   the width of the CMEs. However, there is no simple way of estimating
   the projection effects based on the surface location of the
   Earth-directed CMEs observed by a spacecraft (such as SOHO) located
   along the Sun-Earth line because it is impossible to measure the width
   of these CMEs. The standard assumption that the CME is a rigid cone may
   not be correct. In fact, the predicted arrival times have a better
   agreement with the observed arrival times when no projection correction
   is applied to the SOHO CME measurements. The results presented in this
   work suggest that CMEs expand and accelerate near the Sun (inside 0.7
   AU) more than our model supposes; these aspects will have to be
   included in future models.

   SOLAR ERUPTIONS AND LONG WAVELENGTH RADIO BURSTS: THE 1997 MAY 12 EVENT

                       N. Gopalswamy and M. L. Kaiser

                  Advances in Space Research in press, 2001

                                  Abstract

   We report on the cause of the 1997 May 12 type II bursts observed by
   ground based and space-based radio instruments. We estimate the fast
   mode speed in the corona as a function of heliocentric distance to
   identify the regions where fast mode shocks can be driven by CMEs. We
   find that both the coronal and the interplanetary type II bursts can be
   explained by shocks driven by the same CME at two different spatial
   domains. The fast mode speed in the corona has a peak at a heliocentric
   distance of ~ 3 Rsun which does not allow the coronal shock wave to
   propagate beyond this distance. When the CME continues to travel beyond
   the fast mode peak, another shock forms in the interplanetary medium
   where the fast mode speed falls sufficiently. From the radio
   observations we can infer that the plane of the sky speed of the CME is
   smaller than the space speed by at least a factor of 2, consistent with
   the location of the eruption at N21 W08. The inferred CME speed is also
   consistent with previous deprojected speed estimates.

     Radio Signatures of Coronal Mass Ejection Interaction: Coronal Mass
                            Ejection Cannibalism?

    Gopalswamy, N.; Yashiro, S.; Kaiser, M. L.; Howard, R. A.; Bougeret,

        The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 548, Issue 1, pp. L91-L94.

                                  Abstract

   We report the first detection at long radio wavelengths of interaction
   between coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the interplanetary medium. The
   radio signature is in the form of intense continuum-like radio emission
   following an interplanetary type II burst. At the time of the radio
   enhancement, coronagraphic images show a fast CME overtaking a slow
   CME. We interpret the radio enhancement as a consequence of shock
   strengthening when the shock ahead of the fast CME plows through the
   core of the preceding slow CME. The duration of the radio enhancement
   is consistent with the transit time of the CME-driven shock through the
   core of the slow CME. As a consequence of the interaction, the core of
   the slow CME changed its trajectory significantly. Based on the
   emission characteristics of the radio enhancement, we estimate the
   density of the core of the slow CME to be ~4×10^4 cm^-3. The CME
   interaction has important implications for space weather prediction
   based on halo CMEs: some of the false alarms could be accounted for by
   CME interactions. The observed CME interaction could also explain some
   of the complex ejecta at 1 AU, which have unusual composition.
