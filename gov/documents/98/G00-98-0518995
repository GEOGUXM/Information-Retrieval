   Information on Ex-Im Bank Project Finance Program.

   Project and Structured Finance at Ex-Im Bank

   Ex-Im Bank offers a range of financing solutions for U.S. exporters and
   their foreign customers. Limited Recourse (Project) and Structured
   financing are two options that offer maximum flexibility for project
   sponsors and help U.S. exporters compete globally in natural resource
   and infrastructure sectors. Ex-Im Bank can consider limited recourse
   project financing in most countries and has no country or project
   dollar limits.

   Limited Recourse Project Finance

   Ex-Im Bank`s limited recourse project finance is an arrangement in
   which we lend to newly created project companies and look to the
   project`s future cash flows as our source of repayment instead of
   relying on foreign governments, financial institutions or established
   corporations directly for repayment of the debt. This financing
   arrangement is especially appropriate where hard currency revenues can
   be captured offshore or long-term offtake contracts insure project cash
   flows. But Ex-Im Bank is looking at other innovative structures such as
   risk sharing with suppliers and reinsurance in order to facilitate
   transactions in important industry sectors that may not meet these
   criteria.

   Structured Trade Finance

   While the "Project Finance Division" was created just five years ago,
   Ex-Im Bank has been doing "structured" deals for many years. Now these
   two functions are being handled jointly by the Project and Structured
   Finance Division under Vice President Barbara O`Boyle. "Structured
   finance" means that we can look at existing companies overseas as
   potential borrowers based on their creditworthiness as reflected on
   their balance sheet AND other sources of collateral or security. Ex-Im
   Bank has done structured deals such as multiple country fiberoptic
   cable, oil and gas projects, air traffic control, telecommunications
   and manufacturing entities. In either case, Project or Structure
   finance, Ex-Im Bank has two primary goals:
    1. Maximize U.S. company participation in the transaction in order to
       insure U.S. jobs.
    2. Lend responsibly into creditworthy projects in order to protect the
       interests of our "shareholders," the U.S. taxpayers.

                          An Award Winning Program

   In July 1999 Project Finance magazine named U.S. Ex-Im Bank the "Best
   Project Finance Export Credit Agency" citing impressive responsiveness
   to the needs of project sponsors. The first quarter of 2001, Project
   Finance magazine announced their "Deals of the Year", three financed by
   Ex-Im Bank:

   Intergen/Enka - European Power Deal(s) of the Year
   Bajio - Latin American Merchant Deal of the Year
   KEPCO Ilijan - Asia Pacific Power Deal of the Year

   But we`re not resting on our laurels. Ex-Im is working to improve our
   Project and Structured Finance in a number of areas:
    1. Coverage - Offering comprehensive coverage for a greater variety of
       projects.
    2. Dependability - Converting past political risk only construction
       guarantees into comprehensive term loans and guarantees at "take
       out." (16 projects have successfully converted to date, 2 take out
       dates have been extended, and our remaining portfolio is sched for
       take out through 2002)
    3. Cooperation - Sharing advisors with other lenders and initiating
       intercreditor dialogues earlier in a project life cycle.
    4. Creative - Looking at alternatives to traditional, contractually
       based offtake arrangements that include risk sharing and unique
       structures in a diversity of challenging industry sectors. We may
       also be able to provide guarantees in non-traditional currencies.

   But some things won`t change . . .
    1. Responsiveness - You`ll still get your letters of interest in 7
       days or less (and you can request them on line) or a preliminary
       commitment within 45 days of formally applying for financing.
    2. Transparency - You can still estimate our exposure fees, get
       detailed application information, and look at all of Ex-Im Bank`s
       published documentation (including environmental guidelines,
       country limitations, and project criteria) at "www.exim.gov" under
       "programs" and "structured finance."
    3. Availability - We still have no country or project limits.
       Our ever-expanding pipeline of new deals would seem to indicate
       that we`re on the right track. But we look forward to a
       strengthened dialogue with our customers in order to insure we are
       are being responsive to our customers and our "shareholders."
