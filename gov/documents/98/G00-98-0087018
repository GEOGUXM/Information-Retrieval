   From Galieo to the Stars

   Not since Galileo turned his telescope towards the Heavens in 1610 has
   any event so changed our understanding of the Universe as the
   deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope.

   Hubble Released into Orbit Hubble orbits 600 Kilometers (375) above
   Earth, working around the clock to unlock the secrets of the Universe.
   It uses excelllent pointing precision, powerful optics, and
   state-of-the-art instruments to provide stunning views of the Universe
   that cannot be made using ground-based telescopes or other satellites.
   (Track Hubble's path in orbit!)

   Hubble was originally designed in the 1970s and launched in 1990.
   Thanks to on-orbit service calls by the Space Shuttle astronauts,
   Hubble continues to be a state-of-the-art, model year 2001 space
   telescope.

   Hubble is the first scientific mission of any kind that is specifically
   designed for routine servicing by spacewalking astronauts. It has a
   visionary, modular design Astrnonauts Servicing Hubble which allows the
   astronauts to take it apart, replace worn out equiptment and upgrade
   instruments. These periodic service calls make sure that Hubble
   produces first-class science using cutting-edge technology. See
   technology highlights. Each time a science instrument in Hubble is
   replaced, it increases Hubble scientific power by a factor of 10 or
   greater!

                          Hubble's Accomplishments

   Cluster of Galaxies Abell 2218 Hubble's accomplishments are
   extraordinary. Before Hubble, distances to far-off galaxies were not
   well known. Questions such as how rapidly the Universe is expanding,
   and for how long, created great controversy.

       Hubble data has changed all of that.

   Every day, Hubble archives 3 to 5 gigabytes of data and delivers
   between 10 and 15 gigabytes to astronomers all over the world.
   See science highlights. As of March 2000, Hubble has:

     Taken more than 330,000 separate observations.
     Observed more than 25,000 astronomical targets.
     Created a data archive of over 7.3 terabytes (that√≠s like completely
       filling a PC every day for 10 years).
     Provided data for more than 2,663 scientific papers.
     Traveled about 1.489 billion miles - nearly the distance from Earth
       to Uranus. It circles the Earth about every 97 minutes.
     Received more than 93 hours of on-orbit improvements in three
       successful servicing missions.
