   All sequence from I.M.A.G.E. human cDNA clones have been used to create
   two types of gene clusters: Known Gene Clusters based on NCBI's
   Reference Genes, and Candidate Gene Clusters having no known gene
   association. TIGR clones are used to supplement the Candidate Gene
   clustering. Those clones whose sequence does not match any other cDNA
   are grouped as Singletons. Submit a query against either cluster set to
   obtain a ranked display of available I.M.A.G.E. clones aligned with the
   corresponding known human gene or consensus sequence. Alternative
   methods to query against the Singleton database will be provided at a
   later date.
