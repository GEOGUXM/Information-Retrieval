                  CARNAHAN RETURNS FROM TRIP TO WAR REGION

       "I'M MORE CONVINCED THAN EVER THAT WE WILL WIN THIS WAR AGAINST
    TERRORISM," CARNAHAN SAYS AFTER VISITS WITH U.S. AND MISSOURI TROOPS

   WASHINGTON, DC - Senator Jean Carnahan has returned from her weeklong
   trip with a bipartisan group of nine Senators to countries in the
   United States Central Command (Central Asia) to see firsthand the war
   against terrorism.

   "This trip was our opportunity to send a message to the new Afghan
   government as well as our allies in the region that the United States
   is committed to winning the war on terrorism," Carnahan said. "It also
   highlighted the urgency of bringing peace, freedom, and democracy to
   the region.

   Carnahan poses with Missourians on board the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt
   "I also had the opportunity to meet and speak with many of our troops,
   including several from Missouri. I am honored to report that their
   spirit is strong. They know why they are there and why their work is so
   important. They are proud to be defending the cause of freedom. After
   having met these brave men and women, I am more convinced than ever
   that we will win this war against terrorism."

   The trip lasted from January 3 to January 10 and included visits to
   Ankara, Turkey; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Dushanbe, Tajikistan; Bagram Air
   Force Base in Afghanistan; Islamabad, Pakistan; the aircraft carrier
   U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt; and Muscat, Oman. In Afghanistan, Carnahan
   met with interim President Hamid Karzai, Defense Minister Mohammad
   Qasim Fahim, Foreign Minister Abdullah, and Women's Affairs Minister
   Sima Samar. She also met with Turkish Prime Miniser Bulent Ecevit,
   Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, and the Sultan of Oman.

   Joining Carnahan on the trip were Senators Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.),
   John McCain (R-Ariz.), Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.),
   Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), John Edwards (D-N.C.),
   and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).
