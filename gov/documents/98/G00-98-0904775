   products can be answered on this website, most questions fall into one
   of the categories listed below. If your question is not answered below,
   please submit your query to Bob Stone, CoastWatch Operations Manager.

CoastWatch Websites

    1. What CoastWatch websites are available? Central Operations
       maintains two websites, namely the CoastWatch home page and Ocean
       Product Server. Each CoastWatch Regional Node has a unique website
       for data distribution and specialized products and projects which
       utilize CoastWatch data. Links to these sites are found on the
       Regional Offices page.

Data Formats

    1. What is the CoastWatch data format? CoastWatch supports a variety
       of data formats for satellite images. Scientific quality data may
       be stored in HDF, Arc/Info, or CoastWatch's CWF format. These data
       retain special parameters and metadata required for scientific
       analysis. Image products may be available in GeoTIFF, PNG, or GIF
       formats. These products are easily viewable in graphics
       applications or web browsers. More information on these formats is
       located on the Data Formats page.
    2. When will the new data format be implemented?

Registration

    1. Why do I have to register / How do I register? Registration is only
       required to access higher level scientific datasets and
       registration requirements may differ depending on the type of data
       (i.e. SeaWiFS, AVHRR) that is requested. Registration is necessary
       to access the computers hosting these data.
       If you decide to register, you may do so at the Registration page.
    2. Do I need to be a 'registered' user to access ocean color products?
       No. SeaWiFS imagery purchased and processed by NOAA can be viewed
       online through this website (Browse=>Ocean Color, Browse). If you
       need access to the data (i.e., HDF files) or near real-time imagery
       (i.e., coastal management, resource monitoring) then you must
       become a registered user.
    3. Why must I register for each regional site ? One of the strengths
       of the NOAA CoastWatch Program is the partnership between the
       various NOAA Line Offices. Although data products are consistent
       and older products are stored at a central location, each office
       manages their own information technology systems locally; therefore
       administrative control is maintained at the participating regional
       site. In other words, regional nodes do not issue the same
       usernames and passwords.
    4. Why is the SeaWiFS data restricted? The satellite that supports
       SeaWiFS is a commercial platform owned by OrbImage. Because this is
       a commercially owned and operated platform, NOAA must purchase data
       subject to a contract that defines the appropriate use of ocean
       color data derived from SeaWiFS. NOAA purchased data is restricted
       to "civil marine" operational use and is intended for civil
       authorities (federal, state, and local governments) for watershed
       management and monitoring. Data for research purposes may be
       obtained from NASA under a separate agreement with OrbImage.
    5. How do I become a CoastWatch Ocean Color User? You must meet the
       following criteria:

    1. be a qualified NASA SeaWiFS user (Dear Colleague Letter in place)
       with a need for NRT processing/NOAA algorithms in support of NOAA
       projects
    2. be a coastal manager (local, state, federal government) with a need
       for NOAA operational data for civil marine management
    3. have an understanding of the NOAA CoastWatch SeaWiFS Data Use
       Policy

   If you meet these criteria or have additional questions, then contact
   Kent Hughes, CoastWatch Program Manager to request access. If you only
   need SeaWiFS data solely for research purposes, you should request data
   from the NASA SeaWiFS Project.

Applications or use of CoastWatch Data

    1. How is CoastWatch data used? There are many uses for CoastWatch
       data. Temperature images for instance, are used to locate fishing
       spots and for forecasting weather. Ocean color images help
       scientists track changes in the ocean, and sea surface wind images
       are used primarily by meteorologists and boaters.
    2. Is there any software available that can read CoastWatch data
       formats or help in visualizing the data? Yes. CoastWatch provides
       software and utilities that can read CoastWatch data and allow the
       user to convert or customize the display of CoastWatch products.
       The CoastWatch Data Analysis Tool and Utilities Library are
       available for free through this website.

    1. Why do I get a "JavaScript" error when the pages load?
       This website is designed to be JavaScript 1.2 compliant. This site
       has been tested with Netscape 4+, MS Internet Explorer 4+, and
       Lynx.
    2. How do I obtain data no longer available through this site /
       register with the SAA (Satellite Active Archive)?
       Sea Surface Temperature data is stored in the CoastWatch format at
       the Satellite Active Archive.
       Ocean color products can be browsed on this website and if the data
       is no longer available, checkboxes will be beneath the thumbnail.
       Selecting the appropriate box and pressing the "SAA" button will
       prepare an order for submission to the Satellite Active Archive. In
       order to access the SAA for ocean color products, you must first be
       a CoastWatch Ocean Color User registered with the SAA. To register,
       follow the "SAA Register" link from either the Ocean Color
       Browse/Search interface or after submitting a filelist for
       retrieval.
    3. How accurate are CoastWatch products?
       Accuracies vary with each type of sensor and processing used.
       Validation for most products are available through websites that
       describe the methodology and techniques used to create CoastWatch
       products. The Validation section of the Links page provides access
       to these sites.
