   Advanced Computing and High Energy Physics for the 21st Century

   Physicists and computer scientists at the Department of Energy's Fermilab can
   stake a larger claim on the future of high-energy physicsand on the next
   generation of computingthrough their part in the first-ever awards in DOE's
   Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing Program (SciDAC).


   Department of Energy's Fermilab

      December 10, 2001Through the SciDAC awards, Fermilab will receive
      approximately $1.28 million a year for the next three years as a
      participant in three nationwide collaborations: the Particle Physics
      DataGrid; Advanced Computing for 21st Century Accelerator Science and
      Technology; and the National Computational Infrastructure for Lattice
      Gauge Theory.

      Together, the efforts share in ambitious scientific goals: creating
      computer tools that will allow physicists to work at their home base
      with up-to-the-second experimental data from sources anywhere the
      world; and adapting those access tools to design the high-energy
      physics discovery machines of the future more efficiently and
      economically.

      "We know that there are basic questions of nature that can only be
      answered by building new accelerators to reach higher energy levels,"
      said Fermilab Computing Division Head Matthias Kasemann. "These
      facilities will absolutely require world-wide collaboration, and
      computing is a critical element in making this collaboration work."

   IBM and DOE Pool Supercomputing Talents to Examine Disease

   Massive computing power and biology are coming together in a big way through
   a cooperative research and development agreement between IBM and the U.S.
   Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory.


   Pool Supercomputing

      November 12, 2001At the heart of the agreement is IBM's Blue Gene
      research project, which combines advanced protein science with IBM's
      next-generation cellular architecture supercomputer design.

      Unlike today's computers, cellular servers will run on chips containing
      "cells," which are processors that contain memory and communications
      circuits. Cellular architecture will help scale computer performance
      from teraflops (1 trillion calculations per second) to petaflops (1,000
      trillion calculations per second).

   SciDAC Center for Supernova Research

   National Lab Astrophysicists Explore Supernovae with an Eye on National
   Security

   Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore and Los
   Alamos national laboratories, the University of California Santa Cruz, and
   the University of Arizona will receive a $2 million, three-year grant from
   DOE's Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program to
   research supernovae, the cataclysmic deaths of stars.


   Simulation of the density profile

      November 5, 2001The SciDAC program within DOE's Office of Advanced
      Scientific Computing Research supports High Energy and Nuclear Physics
      research in the use of terascale computers to dramatically extend
      exploration of the fundamental processes of nature, as well as advance
      the ability to predict the behavior of a broad range of complex natural
      and engineered systems.

      "With this grant, we are trying to understand some of the most
      challenging issues in theoretical and computational physics," said Rob
      Hoffman of LLNL, one of the principal scientists for the project.
      "These processes include hydrodynamics, neutrino and radiation
      transport, the nuclear equation of state, convection, thermonuclear
      fusion, and flame propagation. These are precisely the issues at the
      forefront of research at the national laboratories, and progress in
      these areas advances our national security interests as well as our
      understanding of basic science."

   World's Largest Unclassified Supercomputer

   The U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Research Scientific Computing
   Center (NERSC), operated by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, has opened
   its newest supercomputera 3,328-processor IBM RS/6000 SP systemto more than
   2,000 researchers at national laboratories and universities across the
   country.

      October 29, 2001Scientists at universities and national laboratories
      across the country are now tapping into the power of the world's
      largest supercomputer dedicated to unclassified research and have
      reported important breakthroughs in climate research, materials science
      and astrophysics. The IBM SP, named "Seaborg" in honor of Berkeley Lab
      Nobel Laureate Glenn Seaborg, is capable of performing five trillion
      calculations per second (5 teraflop/s).

      "Until now, this level of computing power simply has not been available
      to support research across a broad range of computational science,"
      said Berkeley Lab Director Charles Shank. "As of today, however,
      scientists who are researching global climate change, exploring how to
      cut pollution from internal combustion engines, designing power sources
      for the future and finding new ways to treat disease have a much more
      powerful tool at their disposal. We fully expect this research to help
      shape how we live in the future."

   Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing

   The Department of Energy today announced its first awards under the new
   Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program.

      August 14, 2001Fifty-one projects will receive a total of $57 million
      this fiscal year to develop the scientific computing software and
      hardware infrastructure needed to use terascale computers to advance
      fundamental research in several areas related to the department's
      missions, including climate modeling, fusion energy sciences, chemical
      sciences, nuclear astrophysics, high energy physics and high
      performance computing.

      The SciDAC program will help create a new generation of scientific
      simulation codes. The codes will take full advantage of the
      extraordinary computing capabilities of terascale computers (computers
      capable of doing trillions of calculations per second) to address ever
      larger, more complex problems. The program also includes research on
      improved mathematical and computing systems software that will allow
      these codes to use modern parallel computers effectively.
