   Researchers have released new evidence that strengthens their original
   hypothesis concerning ancient life on Mars. Researchers have also found
   magnetic material in a 4.5-billion-year-old Martian meteorite that
   could only have been produced by bacteria.

   Exploring Mars and Beyond

   As world history illustrates, humans are compelled to discover new
   frontiers. Our exploration of the space frontier has already begun.
   Robotic missions and new technology are the first steps toward
   expanding human presence in the solar system. Human missions to the
   Moon, Mars and beyond may become a reality in the 21st century, and
   NASA is leading the way.

   The world's attention is focused on the exploration of the solar system
   more strongly now than ever before. The discovery of possible ancient
   life on Mars and the Pathfinder examinations are credited with much of
   that attention.

   The rationale for exploring and settling space mirrors the spirit that
   has compelled explorers through the ages.

   NASA's mission to explore continues as we build a foundation of
   technology, experience, and scientific knowledge. During the first
   decades of the 21st century, explorers from Earth could set foot on the
   Moon and Mars and expand the human frontier.
