      The mission of the Southern Appalachian Field Laboratory is to conduct
      basic and applied research to address natural resource management
      problems on Department of the Interior lands, with an emphasis on
      experimental research; long-term or regional, national, or global
      issues; and a holistic perspective of problem solving directed toward
      entire ecosystems.

   Core Capabilities

        * Water resources and watershed research in upland ecosystems of the
          Southeast,
        * Landscape modeling using Geographic Information Systems as a tool
          to predict and mitigate effects of human disturbance on wildlife,
        * Wildlife habitat and population analysis with emphasis on
          management of large mammals,
        * Development of protocols for inventory and monitoring both natural
          and human resources in upland ecosystems in the Southeast.

   Current Research Areas

        * Wildlife research directed toward management problems with emphasis
          on habitat and population analysis.
        * Environmental impacts on the structure and functioning of
          naturally-managed ecosystems..
        * Inventories of natural resources of the Southern Appalachians and
          integration of the data into models of landscape patterns.
        * Social, economic and political parameters that best predict the
          nature and magnitude of human influences on ecosystem processes and
          biodiversity.
