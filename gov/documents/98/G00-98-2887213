   Media Resources

   Image of the flow about a delta wing Tired of those same old Space
   Shuttle and Mars stories? Looking for a new angle on NASA Research?
   While the work in the NAS Systems Division doesn't always make national
   headlines, our cutting-edge information technology research and
   development often forms the foundation for many of NASA's more
   high-profile missions and projects.

   Our web site offers source material for news agencies developing
   stories on NASA work in high-performance computing, national
   computational grids, nanotechnology, and scientific visualization.
     * Recent Announcements contain NASA press releases and short "media
       alerts." You can subscribe to a mailing list that automatically
       sends press releases and announcements.
     * Our fact sheet has background information on the NAS Systems
       Division.
     * Use the Media Contacts section to get more details about NAS work
       from division representatives who are available for comment.
     * The Multimedia Library has high-resolution photos, graphics, and
       video clips for use in news stories.
     * Feature stories regularly appear on the NAS home page. More
       detailed (PDF) versions of many of these stories are published in
       Gridpoints, our quarterly magazine.
