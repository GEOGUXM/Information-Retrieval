              Solar System Orbit Diagrams and Distribution Graphs

[orbit_logo.gif] Solar System Orbit Diagrams NEW!

   Below are diagrams of the planets, asteroids, and comets showing the
   inner solar system (out to the orbit of Jupiter) and the outer solar
   system. There are two diagrams for each: one showing the view looking
   down onto the ecliptic plane and one showing the view from the edge of
   the ecliptic plane. All diagrams represent the positions of the bodies
   on 2002 January 1. These diagrams were created by Paul W. Chodas.

     * Inner Solar System Orbit Diagrams
     * Outer Solar System Orbit Diagrams

   Alternate views of the solar system are available (currently without
   asteroids and comets) at JPL's Solar System Simulator site. Plots of
   the solar system can be created for any specified time. Here are
   examples of the inner and outer solar system on 2002 January 1. Note
   that these alternate views are oriented with the vernal equinox to the
   left instead of the right and therefore appear rotated by 180 degrees
   compared to our plots).

[graph_logo.gif] Small-Body Distribution Graphs

   Plots showings the distribution of asteroids and comets in the inner
   solar system (to ~8 AU). In the following descriptions, ``a'' refers to
   semi-major axis and ``e'' refers to eccentricity. These diagrams were
   created by Alan B. Chamberlin.
     * Asteroids and Comets Inner Solar System Distribution (a vs. e)
     * Asteroid Inner Solar System Distribution (a vs. e)
     * Asteroid Inner Solar System Distribution (histogram of a)
