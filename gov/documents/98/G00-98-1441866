   Statistics

           INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE IS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER
   It is against the law to discriminate against an employee or applicant
   because of his/her race, color, sex (including sexual harassment),
   national origin, age, physical/mental disability, or religion. It is
   also illegal to retaliate or take actions of reprisal against an
   employee for having opposed a discriminatory practice or for having
   participated in an EEO matter. Complaints regarding the Equal Pay Act
   may now be processed in the same manner as other complaints (under Part
   1614). DHHS policy prohibits discrimination because of sexual
   orientation.

   If you believe that you have been discriminated against for any of the
   above reasons, you must contact your respective EEO Office within 45
   days of the alleged discriminatory event. Your right to file a formal
   complaint could be jeopardized if you fail to contact the EEO Office
   within the 45 day time limit.

   Commissioned Officers are not covered under Title VII. In accordance
   with Chapter Series CC26, Conditions of Service, Subchapter CC26.1,
   Officers' Responsibilities and Conduct, Personnel INSTRUCTION 6, Equal
   Opportunity: Discrimination Complaints Processing Commissioned Officers
   should contact the EEO Officer/Manager within 15 days of the alleged
   discriminatory event.

   If you wish to file a complaint or need further information, contact
   one of the following:
