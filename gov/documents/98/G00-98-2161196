   [spacer.gif] Who We Are: JGI Production Genomics Facility [spacer.gif]


   The Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is located in the former Dow Chemical
   Agricultural Research facilities, constructed in the early 1960s in
   Walnut Creek, California. The Institute, established on January 1,
   1997, is a consortium of scientists, engineers and support staff from
   the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore
   and Los Alamos National Laboratories. The JGI has assumed a significant
   role in the effort to determine the 3 billion letters ("base pairs")
   worth of genetic text that make up the human genome. This international
   project, the largest biological undertaking in history, promises untold
   opportunities to understand the basic molecular foundation of life and
   to improve human health. The Production Genomics Facility (PGF)
   consists of 57,000 square feet of laboratory and office space and
   currently houses ~150 researchers and support staff.
