   Welcome to CTAS! The Center-TRACON Automation System, or CTAS, is a set
   of tools designed to help air traffic controllers manage the
   increasingly complex air traffic flows at large airports. The tools in
   CTAS benefit air traffic controllers by reducing stress and workload,
   and benefit air travelers by reducing delays and increasing safety.
   This CTAS Home Page will keep you informed with up-to-date information
   on news items, progress reports, and technical developments concerning
   CTAS research and technology.
