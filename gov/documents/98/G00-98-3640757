                              - Hurricane Mitch

     In late 1998, Hurricanes Mitch and Georges pounded Central America
     and the Caribbean causing thousands of fatalities and billions of
     dollars in damage. As one of the leading US government authorities
     on international trade and environmental protection and restoration,
     the Department of Commerce (DOC) has developed a comprehensive plan
     [.pdf format] to help Central America and the Dominican Republic
     rebuild their economies and improve their abilities to respond to
     and mitigate against hurricanes and other natural disasters. The
     Department's plan is comprised of assistance programs developed by
     three of its bureaus:

     * International Trade Administration (ITA)
     * National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
     * National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

     This Web page is intended to provide helpful information to US
     businesses which currently have, or are interested in developing,
     business contacts and/or operations in Central America or the
     Caribbean; non-governmental organizations and US and national
     agencies involved in the reconstruction effort; and private
     individuals wishing simply to learn more about the assistance being
     provided by DOC and other US government agencies.
