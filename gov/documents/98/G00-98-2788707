     ArcView Extensions and Scripts

        ESRI
          * Spatial Analyst - provides a broad range of powerful spatial
            modeling and analysis features. ArcView Spatial Analyst allows you
            to create, query, map, and analyze cell-based raster data and to
            perform integrated vector-raster analysis.
          * Image Analysis - brings "geographic imaging" capabilities to
            ArcView GIS. This extension supports a range of image analysis
            capabilities including image rectification, color enhancement, and
            simple change detection.
          * Internet Map Server - an out-of-the-box map publishing tool for the
            World Wide Web. It includes a Java applet for map display across
            the Web.
          * 3D Analyst - provides a suite of high-quality, easy-to-use tools
            for creating, analyzing, and visualizing surface data and other 3D
            data.
          * Tracking Analyst - a new extension that allows direct feed and
            playback of real-time data, such as Global Positioning System (GPS)
            data, within the ArcView GIS environment.
          * ArcScripts - useful user scripts to automate many ArcView and
            ARC/INFO functions.

        USGS
          * Animal Movement Analysis - a collection of over 30 functions to aid
            in the analysis of animal movement data. Includes home range
            calculations, site fidelity tests, polyline from pointfile, nearest
            neighbor analysis, spider diagrams and more. There are two
            versions, one that requires Spatial Analyst and one that does not.
          * Spatial Tools - a collection of grid tools. Menus, tools and
            buttons provide access to various spatial modeling and analysis
            capabilities such as geometric transformations, mosaicking,
            resolution alteration, data clean-up and spatial analysis. Requires
            Spatial Analyst.
