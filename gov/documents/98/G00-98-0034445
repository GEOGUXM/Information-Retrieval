   CERINE produces derived satellite images for the eastern United States.
   Data is collected from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
   (AVHRR), aboard the polar-orbiting satellites NOAA-12 and NOAA-14, and
   from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWifs) aboard the
   Orbview-2 satellite. The AVHRR is a high-resolution (1 km),
   multi-channel visible and infrared radiometer used for analyzing cloud
   variability and heights, deriving sea surface temperature (SST), land
   vegetation indices, and total outgoing longwave radiation. CERINE
   generates AVHRR images daily for near-infrared and thermal infrared
   bands, sea surface temperature, wind, normalized vegetation index,
   geopotential height at 500mb, and temperature at 850 mb. SeaWiFs images
   are generated on a delayed schedule (about 1 month) for chlorophyll,
   near-infrared, and Aerosol Optical Depth. There are two regions
   covered: Eastern SeaBoard (ESB) covering most of the eastern U.S. and
   parts of Canada and Long Island Region (LIR) covering the eastern
   mid-atlantic states. The ESB region is at 5 km resolution. The LIR
   region is at a higher 1 km resolution.
