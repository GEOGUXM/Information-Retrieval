        * Lake Tahoe Basin Riparian Assessment
          The United States Forest Service Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit
          and researchers at the University of Nevada at Reno recently
          completed an assessment of channel conditions and wildlife habitat
          in the riparian corridors of fifteen streams in the Tahoe Basin.
          This study was funded in part by the California Tahoe Conservancy.
          The study produced several sets of geographic data for each of the
          riparian corridors.
