   .69 - viii - GLOSSARY "APIs" Application Programming Interfaces. APIs
   are interfaces exposed by an operating system or other platform
   software that can be invoked by other software to obtain a wide range
   of system services, such as displaying text on the video monitor or
   saving a document to the hard disk. "DOJ" Antitrust Division of the
   U.S. Department of Justice. "FF" Findings of fact issued by the
   district court on November 5, 1999 and reported at 84 F. Supp. 2d 9
   (D.D.C. 1999). "IAPs" Internet Access Providers. Plaintiffs use the
   term IAPs to refer collectively to both ISPs and OLSs. "ICPs" Internet
   Content Providers. ICPs are entities that provide content and
   applications to users of the Internet by main- taining Web sites. "IE"
   The Internet Explorer components of Windows operating systems. "ISPs"
   Internet Service Providers. ISPs provide their subscribers with a
   connection to the Internet via telephone, cable or satellite, typically
   in exchange for a monthly fee. "ISVs" Independent Software Vendors.
   ISVs are entities engaged in developing and marketing software
   products, including applications, tools and utilities. "Java" The term
   Java applies to three separate but related con- cepts: (i) a high-level
   programming language developed by Sun, (ii) a set of class libraries
   that provide services to Java programs, and (iii) a runtime called a
   Java Virtual Machine that executes Java programs. The Java programming
   langu- age is an object-oriented variant of the C++ programming
   language that has been simplified to eliminate features like memory
   pointers that cause common programming errors. "JVM" Java Virtual
   Machine. Software that executes programs written in the Java
   programming language after they have been compiled into intermediate
   instructions called Java bytecodes. JVMs are included with popular
   operating systems from vendors like Apple, Hewlett-Packard, IBM,
   Microsoft and Novell. - ix - "Linux" An operating system whose kernel
   was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish graduate student, and
   subse- quently expanded and improved on a cooperative basis by software
   developers around the world. "MS Br." Brief for Defendant-Appellant
   Microsoft Corporation. "Navigator" Web browsing software developed by
   Netscape. Netscape and Navigator are now owned by AOL Time Warner.
   "Netscape" Netscape Communications Corp. A company co-founded by Marc
   Andreessen and Jim Clark that developed the first commercially
   successful Web browsing software. Netscape is now owned by AOL Time
   Warner. "NSP" Native Signal Processing. NSP is the name Intel gave to a
   group of software products designed to consume additional
   microprocessor cycles and thereby spur demand for more advanced Intel
   products. NSP narrowly refers to the ability of Intel microprocessors
   to process certain digital signals internally rather than through the
   use of an external device known as a digital signal processor or DSP.
   As originally designed by Intel in 1995, NSP software was incompatible
   with both Windows 95 and Windows NT. "OEMs" Original Equipment
   Manufacturers. OEMs are manufac- turers or assemblers of personal
   computers. "OLSs" Online Services. OLSs provide their subscribers with
   a connection to the Internet as well as proprietary content and
   services like e-mail and personal Web pages. "PC" Personal Computer.
   "Pls. Br." Brief for Appellees United States and the State Plaintiffs.
   "Windows 95" A client operating system developed by Microsoft that was
   commercially released in August 1995. Windows 95 incorporated the
   functionality of MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 in a 32-bit operating system
   with a range of new fea- tures and functionality. Windows 95 was
   updated with various interim releases, called OSRs, that were provided
   by Microsoft to OEMs. - x - "Windows 98" A client operating system
   developed by Microsoft that was commercially released in June 1998.
   Windows 98 is an improved version of Windows 95 that includes a range
   of new features and functionality. Windows 98 has been updated by
   interim releases provided to OEMs. "Windows NT" An operating system
   developed by Microsoft that was first commercially released in 1992.
   Windows NT has a funda- mentally different architecture than Windows
   95, Windows 98 and Windows Millennium. The three principal versions of
   Windows NT (3.1, 3.51 and 4.0) were targeted primarily at business
   customers. Windows NT is the predecessor of Windows 2000. "Windows
   Update" A feature of Windows 98 that automatically detects when new
   enhancements to the operating system have not been installed on a
   user's computer and allows the user to down- load such enhancements
   easily from a Microsoft Web site. - xi - INTRODUCTION Plaintiffs
   acknowledge that much of the conduct they challenge was lawful and
   procom- petitive. On the central issue in the case, plaintiffs concede
   that Microsoft did not violate the antitrust laws by "offering IE to
   OEMs in a bundle with Windows at no extra charge." Pls. Br. at 63-64.
   Indeed, they admit that the district court found Microsoft's conduct
   "in developing a Web browser and offering it to OEMs and users with
   Windows to be lawful." Id. at 66. With regard to the challenged
   distribution agreements, plaintiffs concede that "[d]eveloping and
   improving [IE], making it widely available, and encouraging its use
   based on the merits of the product consti- tuted competition on the
   merits." Id. at 62. And, with regard to Java, plaintiffs acknowledge
   that Microsoft "develop[ed] an attractive alternative Java
   implementation" for Windows. Id. at 66-67. Whatever remains of
   plaintiffs' case after these concessions does not amount to a Sherman
   Act violation, and is certainly not sufficient to justify breaking up
   Microsoft and imposing other extreme relief. Despite acknowledging the
   procompetitive nature of much of the challenged conduct, plaintiffs'
   over-arching theme is that Microsoft's conduct "would be inexplicable
   for a non- monopolist." Id. at 42. Contrary to plaintiffs' repeated
   assertions, e.g., id. at 3, 36, 65, the chal- lenged conduct made
   perfect "business sense" for anyone seeking to develop and market oper-
   ating systems that appeal to users and ISVs. In response to demand for
   Internet-related functionality, all major operating systems-not just
   Windows-now include Web browsing soft- ware. Schmalensee ¶¶ 216-23;
   Allchin ¶¶ 261-77. In fact, Netscape correctly predicted in January
   1995-before any of the challenged conduct occurred-that all vendors
   would "eventu- ally incorporate some Web browser functions into their
   operating systems as standard features" and "offer this functionality
   at little or no additional cost to customers." DX 68 at 69242.
   Microsoft announced its decision to "include built-in access to the
   Internet" in Windows long before Netscape released its first version of
   Navigator. MS Br. at 21. Even plaintiffs grudgingly concede that
   "improving the quality of Windows by including Web browsing or other
   func- tionalities without separate charge might have made business
   sense." Pls. Br. at 62; see also United States v. Microsoft Corp., 84
   F. Supp. 2d 9, 45 (D.D.C. 1999) (FF 140). After investing "more than
   $100 million each year" to improve the IE components of Windows, Pls.
   Br. at 15, it also made perfect business sense for Microsoft to enter
   into agree- ments designed to achieve widespread distribution of IE,
   thereby helping to attract ISV interest in the new platform
   capabilities IE provided. Such cross-marketing agreements are
   commonplace in all industries, not just in software. 1/4/99 pm Tr. at
   83-91; 2/9/99 am Tr. at 31-37; GX 1256 at 294, 295; DX 1427; DX 2082.
   Microsoft has been following this same business model- improving its
   platforms to meet demand for additional functionality, distributing
   those improvements broadly and encouraging ISVs to utilize those
   improvements-for 20 years. Instead of addressing the fatal defects in
   their case, plaintiffs drape themselves in the district court's
   findings of fact, intimating that this Court is constrained to accept
   those findings without subjecting them to scrutiny. In considering this
   invitation to rubberstamp what the district court did, the Court should
   bear in mind the district court's goal in drafting its findings. As the
   district judge told Ken Auletta, a reporter for the New Yorker writing
   a book about the case, he separated his findings of fact from his
   conclusions of law (thus enabling him to import numerous conclusions
   into his findings) in order to insulate his ruling from reversal: There
   may have been another motive to split the facts from the law, whispered
   lawyers on opposite sides of the case: Judge Jackson was trying to box
   in the Court of Appeals. Guilty, Jackson later admitted to me, "The
   general rule of law is that the Court of Appeals is generally expected
   to defer to the trial judge as to matters of fact-unless the findings
   are clearly erroneous . . . . What I want to do is confront the Court
   of Appeals with an established factual record which is a fait - 2 -
   accompli. And part of the inspiration for doing that is that I take
   mild offense at their reversal of my preliminary injunction in the
   consent-decree case, where they went ahead and made up about ninety
   percent of the facts on their own." KEN AULETTA, WORLD WAR 3.0:
   MICROSOFT AND ITS ENEMIES 230 (2001). The district judge's repeated
   public comments (see MS Br. at 146-50) also demonstrate an animus
   towards Microsoft so strong that it inevitably infected his rulings.
   For example, Auletta reports that the district judge compared Microsoft
   executives to unremorseful gang mem- bers convicted of brutal,
   execution-style murders, AULETTA, supra at 369-70, and criticized
   Microsoft's CEO for having "`a Napoleonic concept of himself and his
   company,'" id. at 397. Indeed, in the public eye, the district judge
   has joined the fray as an adversary of Microsoft. By contrast, the
   district judge told Auletta that he holds government lawyers in
   particu- larly high regard, giving credence to the charges they level
   against a defendant: "I trust the lawyers from the Department of
   Justice. I trust civil servants and the U.S. attorneys. I'm not hostile
   to the government . . . . In criminal cases, by and large, my
   experience is that when the government charges someone, they are
   probably guilty. I give the benefit of presumptive innocence, but I
   know of no case of a wrongful conviction." Id. at 44. Such comments put
   the proper gloss on the district court's findings. In another case in
   which there was reason-but far less reason-to question whether a
   district judge improperly decided a matter based on his personal views,
   this Court stated: "[I]n light of the special circum- stances of this
   case, we have reviewed the District Court's findings against the record
   with parti- cular, even painstaking, care." S. Pac. Communications Co.
   v. AT&T, 740 F.2d 980, 984 (D.C. Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S.
   1005 (1985). Painstaking review is warranted here as well. SUMMARY OF
   ARGUMENT 1. Plaintiffs continue to retreat from their tying claim.
   Although they pay lip service to the notion that Windows and IE are
   "separate products," plaintiffs make no effort to satisfy this - 3 -
   Court's test. In fact, plaintiffs no longer argue that IE can or should
   be removed from Windows, recognizing that other parts of the operating
   system and numerous Windows applications rely on IE. Instead of
   attempting to show that the many benefits of Microsoft's integrated
   design could be duplicated by combining an operating system with a
   standalone Web browser such as Navigator, plaintiffs argue something
   completely different: that Microsoft violated Section 1 because it
   failed to permit its distributors-OEMs-to hide "user access" to the
   built-in Web browsing functionality in Windows. That argument flies in
   the face of this Court's June 1998 decision and tying law generally.
   See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 147 F.3d 935, 941 n.3 (D.C. Cir.
   1998) ("[B]y allowing OEMs to conceal IE, rather than to refuse it, the
   remedy fits poorly with the Department's tying theory."). Plaintiffs'
   failure to show that the alleged tie fore- closed competition in the
   "Web browser" market is also fatal to their tying claim. Microsoft's
   lack of success with IE 1 and IE 2 is dispositive on this point.
   Although included in every copy of Windows 95 distributed through the
   OEM channel over a twelve-month period, IE 1 and IE 2 struggled to
   obtain a 5% usage share, while Navigator enjoyed a usage share
   exceeding 80%. 2. Plaintiffs have not shown that Microsoft possesses
   "monopoly power," i.e., the power to control price or exclude
   competition. Plaintiffs also have not established that Microsoft
   engaged in "anticompetitive" conduct, or that the challenged conduct
   contributed significantly to the maintenance of Microsoft's supposed
   monopoly. The two principal pillars of plaintiffs' monopoly maintenance
   claim-tying and exclusive dealing-were also the bases for plaintiffs'
   Section 1 claims. Plaintiffs cite no authority for their assertion that
   conduct can be "exclusion- ary" under Section 2 even though it did not
   "unreasonably restrain trade" under Section 1. Nor do plaintiffs
   address the district court's findings that Netscape was able to
   distribute 160 million copies of Navigator in 1998 alone and had access
   to "every PC user worldwide," which under- - 4 - mine any claim of
   foreclosure. Finally, plaintiffs failed to prove that there would be
   any more competition in the putative market for "Intel-compatible PC
   operating systems" if Microsoft had not engaged in the challenged
   conduct. 3. Plaintiffs base their attempted monopolization claim
   primarily on the June 1995 dis- cussions between Microsoft and
   Netscape, which they concede resulted in nothing. Plaintiffs cite only
   one case, United States v. American Airlines, Inc., 743 F.2d 1114 (5th
   Cir. 1984), cert. dismissed, 474 U.S. 1001 (1985), in which a court
   found that making a proposal that is then rejected by the other party
   can constitute attempted monopolization. Microsoft's efforts to per-
   suade Netscape to utilize Internet-related functionality in Windows 95
   bear no resemblance to the naked price-fixing proposal in American
   Airlines. Plaintiffs also ignore Barksdale's admis- sion that Microsoft
   was eager at the time for Netscape to release a version of Navigator
   for Windows 95 because Microsoft believed it would increase demand for
   the new operating system. Plaintiffs go on to argue that Microsoft's
   "post-June 1995" conduct likewise constituted attempted monopolization.
   Yet they concede that Microsoft's goal in competing with Netscape was
   to prevent Navigator from becoming the "standard" Web browsing
   software, not to obtain "monopoly power" in the alleged "Web browser"
   market. Plaintiffs also have not established a dangerous probability of
   monopolization, especially now that Navigator is in the hands of AOL
   Time Warner, a formidable competitor. 4. The extreme relief imposed by
   the district court without conducting an evidentiary hearing is
   unsustainable. Plaintiffs' various arguments in defense of the district
   court's decision to impose extreme relief based on uncross-examined
   declarations and excerpts from newspaper and magazine articles are
   specious. The district court was not at liberty to deny Microsoft an
   evi- dentiary hearing on disputed factual issues or to base permanent
   injunctive relief on rank hear- - 5 - say. More fundamentally, neither
   the facts nor the law justifies breaking up Microsoft or impos- ing
   punitive "conduct" remedies that would result in confiscation of
   Microsoft's intellectual property and unprecedented governmental
   regulation of the design of Microsoft's operating systems. In addition
   to these defects, if the Court rejects any of the district court's
   liability rulings, the entire decree must be vacated because it is
   impossible to determine which provisions were intended to redress which
   supposed violations. 5. Once plaintiffs were permitted to expand their
   case dramatically, the district court abused its discretion in rushing
   the case to trial and limiting both sides to twelve witnesses. Contrary
   to plaintiffs' assertions, Microsoft never agreed to the district
   court's unorthodox pro- cedures. Nor can plaintiffs deny that it is
   impossible to ascertain whether the district court improperly relied on
   inadmissible hearsay because there are no record citations in its
   findings. 6. The district judge's public comments about the merits of
   the case and his ad hominem attacks on Microsoft are indefensible.
   Plaintiffs cannot seriously contend, for example, that it was
   permissible for the district judge to compare Microsoft to "gangland
   killers" in comments made to a reporter while the case was still
   pending. Such comments (i) violate the Code of Conduct for United
   States Judges, (ii) are clear grounds for disqualification under 28
   U.S.C. § 455(a), and (iii) provide an independent basis to vacate the
   judgment. ARGUMENT Plaintiffs argue that Microsoft waived any challenge
   to the district court's findings be- cause it did not "assert
   specifically that any fact found by the district court is clearly
   erroneous." Pls. Br. at 3. They acknowledge, however, that Microsoft
   expressly stated that the district court's findings are subject to
   review for clear error, id. at 46, and their brief makes abundantly
   clear that they understand Microsoft is challenging the accuracy of
   many findings, particularly those relat- - 6 - ing to market
   definition, monopoly power, product design and Netscape's distribution
   of Navigator through the OEM and IAP channels. Plaintiffs fail to cite
   a single case which holds that a defendant waives its challenge to
   factual findings if it does not expressly invoke the "clearly
   erroneous" mantra each time it takes issue with a finding. To the
   contrary, when an appellant expresses disagreement with a finding of
   fact, this Court reviews the evidence discussed by the district court
   and the parties and rejects the finding if the Court is "left with the
   definite and firm conviction that a mistake in factfinding has been
   committed by the trial court." S. Pac. Communications, 740 F.2d at 998.
   Given the district court's failure to cite any evidence in its findings
   of fact, plaintiffs have done nothing to assist this Court's review by
   simply regurgitating the findings in their statement of case and only
   sporadically citing record evidence. Making matters worse, plaintiffs'
   descrip- tion of the facts is sometimes so incomplete as to be
   misleading. For example, in discussing Intel's NSP software, Pls. Br.
   at 39-40, plaintiffs fail to mention that NSP was incompatible with
   Windows 95 and Windows NT, MS Br. at 55-57; DX 978. Plaintiffs also
   state that Microsoft delayed the release of Windows 98 to permit
   inclusion of IE 4, Pls. Br. at 23, but they fail to acknowledge that IE
   4 was made available on October 1, 1997, eight months before the June
   1998 release of Windows 98, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 13 (FF 8); Chase ¶ 136;
   2/4/99 pm Tr. at 11-12. In other instances, plaintiffs' description of
   the facts is simply false. For example, they assert that "[e]ven as
   late as June 1995," Microsoft was planning to include only "low-level
   Internet `plumbing'" with Windows 95. Pls. Br. at 20 (emphasis added).
   The cited finding, however, says something different: "[A]s late as the
   fall of 1994, Microsoft was planning to include low-level Internet
   `plumbing,' such as a TCP/IP stack, but not a browser, with Windows
   95." 84 F. Supp. 2d at 49 (FF 156) (emphasis added). And the two cited
   exhibits, GX 124 and GX 125, are dated - 7 - April 1994 and June 1994,
   respectively. GX 124 (April 20, 1994 e-mail); GX 125 (June 10, 1994
   e-mail); see also MS Br. at 20-24 (Microsoft's decision to include IE
   in Windows predated Netscape's emergence as a competitor). For
   Microsoft to prevail, however, this Court need not reject a single
   finding of fact. As Microsoft explained in its opening brief, MS Br. at
   68, even if one were to accept the district court's one-sided findings
   in toto, the district court's conclusion that Microsoft violated the
   Sherman Act and corresponding state-law provisions is unsustainable as
   a matter of law. I. The District Court's Tying Ruling Should Be
   Reversed. Plaintiffs continue to de-emphasize their tying claim, which
   was the focus of their com- plaints and their sole basis for urging
   that the case be rushed to trial. See 5/22/98 Tr. at 5-12, 20- 24,
   30-33. Plaintiffs no longer seriously contend that IE is a "separate
   product" that can be removed from Windows. Instead, they now claim that
   Microsoft violated the antitrust laws because it did not permit its
   distributors, OEMs, to remove from Windows "the means of user access"
   to some of the Web browsing functionality provided by IE. Pls. Br. at
   104. By arguing that only "user access" to this functionality should be
   made removable, plaintiffs acknowledge that IE provides important
   functionality to other parts of the operating system (e.g., the Windows
   Update feature) and to applications running on Windows. Plaintiffs cite
   no case upholding a tying claim based on a defendant's failure to
   permit its distributors to hide "user access" to valuable features of a
   product that benefit consumers. Recognizing that they cannot establish
   that Windows 98 is an unlawful tie under control- ling precedent,
   plaintiffs focus on Microsoft's inclusion of IE 1 and IE 2 in Windows
   95 in the twelve months between August 1995 and August 1996, something
   barely mentioned in their complaints. Pls. Br. at 101, 102, 105.
   Plaintiffs argue that "[w]hatever the implications of [this - 8 -
   Court's decision] for the versions of Windows and IE that are
   physically linked, it provides no basis to reverse the district court's
   determination that Microsoft unlawfully tied IE 1 and IE 2." Id. at
   102. That plaintiffs are reduced to arguing about obsolete versions of
   IE that have not been part of Windows for more than four years speaks
   volumes about their tying claim. Although IE was less integrated in the
   initial releases of Windows 95 than it was in sub- sequent releases,
   Microsoft's inclusion of IE 1 and IE 2 in the operating system had no
   antitrust significance because it resulted in no foreclosure of
   competition in the putative "Web browser" market. As the district court
   found, in late 1995 and early 1996, IE's usage share was approximately
   5%, whereas Navigator's usage share exceeded 80%. 84 F. Supp. 2d at
   98-99 (FF 360); see also Barksdale ¶ 222; Warren-Boulton ¶ 137; Fisher
   ¶ 230; Allchin ¶ 322; Chase ¶ 136. The fact that so many users in 1995
   and 1996 chose to use Navigator rather than IE despite the presence of
   an IE icon on the desktop of every copy of Windows 95 distributed
   through the OEM channel demonstrates that the alleged tie had no
   competitive impact whatso- ever in the market for the putative tied
   product. Schmalensee ¶¶ 524-25. Even plaintiffs' own economist,
   Franklin Fisher, admitted that IE 1 and IE 2 were competitively
   insignificant because so few consumers used them. 6/3/99 pm Tr. at
   47-48. Absent some exclusionary effect, the inclusion of IE 1 and IE 2
   in Windows- Microsoft's first steps in integrating Web browsing
   functionality into the operating system- cannot violate Section 1, much
   less provide a basis for breaking up the company four years later. See
   Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 21 n.34 (1984)
   ("The legality of petitioners' conduct depends on its competitive
   consequences, not on whether it can be labeled `tying.'"). All that IE
   1 and IE 2 establish is that, contrary to plaintiffs' claim,
   distribution of Web browsing software in the operating system is not
   uniquely effective in garnering usage. - 9 - A. Windows and IE Are Not
   "Separate Products" under This Court's Test. Plaintiffs contend that
   the district court properly applied the "conventional" Jefferson Parish
   test rather than the test articulated by this Court in its June 1998
   decision. Pls. Br. at 98. Although the district court initially
   recognized that this Court "articulate[d] a framework for determining
   whether an integration amounts to a single product for purposes of
   evaluating a tying claim," United States v. Microsoft Corp., 1998-2
   Trade Cas. (CCH) ¶ 72,261, at 82,675 (D.D.C. Sept. 14, 1998),
   plaintiffs argue that this Court's decision provided no "direct
   guidance on how to apply Section 1 to tying arrangements," Pls. Br. at
   101. To begin with, the Supreme Court held in Jefferson Parish "that
   products are separate for tie-in purposes if there are separate markets
   for each product." Jack Walters & Sons Corp. v. Morton Bldg., Inc., 737
   F.2d 698, 703 (7th Cir.) (emphasis added), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1018
   (1984); see also X PHILLIP E. AREEDA ET AL., ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 1745d2, at
   211 (1996) ("[A] distinct market for the tied item does not imply
   separate products absent widespread sales of the tying item in
   unbundled form."). There is virtually no consumer demand for operating
   systems with no Web browsing functionality. Because Internet access is
   the leading reason consumers purchase personal computers today, all
   major operating systems now provide Web browsing functionality.
   Schmalensee ¶¶ 216-23; Allchin ¶¶ 261-77; see also Rose ¶¶ 19, 21. More
   importantly, plaintiffs do not dispute that this Court previously
   rejected the DOJ's assertion that Jefferson Parish's "consumer-demand"
   test applies to integrated products. 147 F.3d at 946. This Court stated
   that applying the "consumer-demand" test to integrated products would
   stymie innovation by thwarting companies' "legitimate desire to
   continue to integrate products that had been separate-and hence
   necessarily would have been provided in distinct markets." Id. at 953.
   Plaintiffs say nothing about the chilling effect that applying
   Jefferson Parish to integrated products would have on innovation in a
   wide range of industries. See MS Br. - 10 - at 70. They do not deny
   that under the "consumer-demand" test, every addition of new function-
   ality previously provided by a standalone product could be challenged
   as an unlawful tie, thus making the permissibility of such innovations
   a question for judges and juries. Plaintiffs' efforts to minimize the
   significance of this Court's decision are unavailing. First, although
   this Court's decision involved the "construction of a consent decree,"
   Pls. Br. at 101, plaintiffs do not deny that this Court relied on
   antitrust cases and the Areeda treatise in fashioning its test. See 147
   F.3d at 948-50. Second, plaintiffs argue that this Court's decision has
   "only limited application here" because it centered on "the
   combinations of Windows 95 with IE3 and IE4," whereas this case also
   involves IE 1 and IE 2. Pls. Br. at 101. Plaintiffs do not dispute,
   however, that the focus of this case has always been on Windows 98, and
   that IE is even more deeply integrated into Windows 98 than it was into
   Windows 95. See 11/16/98 pm Tr. at 46. Third, plaintiffs emphasize that
   this Court's decision was based on "a `limited record,'" Pls. Br. at
   105 (quoting 147 F.3d at 950 n.15), but the applicable legal framework
   does not change depending on the extent of the record. Fourth,
   plaintiffs suggest that less deference should be given to product
   design decisions in the software industry because software "is a
   uniquely malleable product." Id. at 67. Yet this Court established its
   test fully cognizant that "[s]oftware code by its nature is susceptible
   to division and combination in a way that physical products are not."
   147 F.3d at 951. As a fallback, plaintiffs argue, as they did below,
   that Windows and IE are separate products under this Court's test. Pls.
   Br. at 104-07. Had the district court agreed, it presumably would have
   so ruled. Plaintiffs come up short under this Court's test in any event
   because they cannot show that the many benefits of Microsoft's
   integrated design could be duplicated by - 11 - combining an operating
   system "with a stand-alone browser such as Netscape's Navigator." 147
   F.3d at 950. In fact, plaintiffs do not even attempt to meet that
   standard. Plaintiffs do not deny that Microsoft's design of Windows to
   include Web browsing soft- ware produced significant, tangible benefits
   to users, ISVs and OEMs. See Allchin ¶¶ 105-41 & App. A. To the
   contrary, plaintiffs concede that the district court found that
   Microsoft's inclusion of Web browsing functionality in Windows
   benefited consumers. Pls. Br. at 66, 103 (citing 84 F. Supp. 2d at 55,
   110-11 (FF 186, 408)). They also accept that there are significant
   benefits to "using HTML rendering and other technologies used in
   browsing to provide non-browsing functions" in Windows 98, such as the
   user interface, the HTML Help system and the Windows Update feature.
   Id. at 66. And plaintiffs acknowledge that "IE expose[s] APIs" on which
   ISVs rely in developing applications for Windows, id. at 122, including
   applications that display infor- mation in HTML, 147 F.3d at 950-51.
   Rather than attempting to show that any of these benefits could be
   duplicated by combining an operating system with a standalone Web
   browser such as Navigator-as required by this Court's test-plaintiffs
   proclaim with remarkable circularity that the benefits can be obtained
   by combining Windows with its IE components. Pls. Br. at 107; see also
   MS Br. at 76-77. Plaintiffs also argue that "there was no reason why
   Microsoft could not provide a `browserless' version of Windows." Pls.
   Br. at 103. They contend that "[a] `browserless Windows' is Windows
   with no accessible browsing functionality, regardless of how that is
   accomplished." Id. at 104. According to plaintiffs, "[a]dding or
   removing the means of user access to a given function, by whatever
   means, amounts to adding or removing the software product," even if no
   software code is removed. Id. Thus, under plaintiffs' view, IE would be
   "removed" from Windows even though all of the relevant software code
   remains in the operating - 12 - system and continues to expose APIs to
   applications and provide important functionality to other parts of
   Windows. In other words, plaintiffs contend that Microsoft violated
   Section 1 because it failed to provide a version of Windows in which
   "user access" to some of its Web browsing functionality was hidden or
   disabled. Id. at 103. Plaintiffs cite no authority for the startling
   proposition that the antitrust laws required Microsoft to offer
   consumers a product with useful functionality hidden. Plaintiffs' focus
   on hiding "user access" is a departure from the position they took at
   trial. For instance, the DOJ alleged in its complaint that it is
   "technically feasible and practicable to remove Microsoft's Internet
   browser software from Windows 98," but that "OEMs are prevented from
   doing so by Microsoft's contractual tie-in." DOJ Compl. ¶ 20 (emphasis
   added). Similarly, plaintiffs' technical expert, Edward Felten,
   insisted that his so-called "prototype removal pro- gram" showed "that
   Microsoft can deliver a version of Windows 98 from which the IE Web
   browser has been removed, and they can deliver that in a way which does
   not affect the non Web-browsing functionality of Windows 98." 6/10/99
   am Tr. at 9 (emphasis added). By arguing that only "user access" to Web
   browsing functionality can or should be removed, plaintiffs now
   acknowledge that Microsoft's so-called "Internet browser" should remain
   in Windows because it provides essential functionality to both
   applications and other parts of the operating system. This Court has
   already stated that requiring Microsoft merely "to hide the allegedly
   tied product" by, for example, running the Add/Remove Programs utility,
   "suggests the oddity of treating as separate products functionalities
   that are integrated in the way Windows 95 and IE are." 147 F.3d at 952
   n.18. As this Court previously observed, plaintiffs do not seek to
   "remove the IE software code, which indeed continues to play a role in
   providing non-browser func- tionality for Windows." Id. at 941. "In
   fact, browser functionality itself persists," and can be - 13 -
   summoned up "by running any application (such as Quicken) that contains
   the code necessary to invoke the functionality." Id. (emphasis in
   original). As in the prior case, all plaintiffs seek is to "enable the
   OEMs to make user access to IE more difficult." Id. Because little, if
   any, software code is removed in the process, eliminating "user access"
   to Web browsing functionality does nothing to alleviate the purported
   "collateral harm" that the district court found results from inclusion
   of IE in Windows. 84 F. Supp. 2d at 53, 111 (FF 173, 410). (This
   supposed "harm" simply reflects the engineering tradeoff inherent in
   adding func- tionality to Windows: it entails consumption of additional
   computer resources. See MS Revised Proposed Findings of Fact ¶¶
   594-95.) As plaintiffs' own technical expert, Glenn Weadock, admitted,
   "merely removing the means of access to Web-browsing software does very
   little to address" concerns about "computer resource use (disk space,
   memory, CPU power, et cetera)." 11/16/98 pm Tr. at 23-24. The absurdity
   of treating "user access" to Web browsing functionality as the tied
   product is also highlighted by the relief awarded. Although the
   district court's breakup order assigns IE to the so-called "AppsCo,"
   Pls. Br. at 120, plaintiffs still cannot identify the software code or
   files that they claim constitute IE, id. at 103-04. Presumably, the
   district court intended for "AppsCo" to receive something more than an
   icon, which is, after all, nothing but a small picture of a blue "e."
   And the restrictions on the ability of the so-called "OpsCo" to develop
   modified versions of IE are incomprehensible if there is no delineation
   of what software code or files constitute IE. See MS Comments on Pls.
   Revised Proposed Final J. at 7-8. Plaintiffs' arguments about hiding
   "user access" to functionality do nothing to undermine the fact that
   Microsoft has, once again, "clearly met the burden of ascribing
   facially plausible benefits to its integrated design as compared to an
   operating system combined with a stand-alone - 14 - browser such as
   Netscape's Navigator." 147 F.3d at 950. On this question-which is
   dispositive under this Court's test-plaintiffs are silent. B. The
   Alleged Tie Did Not Have an Anticompetitive Effect on the Putative "Web
   Browser" Market. Plaintiffs incorrectly assert that Microsoft disputes
   only the "separate products" element of their tying claim. Pls. Br. at
   97. Microsoft clearly argued in its opening brief that plaintiffs'
   tying claim fails for an additional reason: the alleged tie did not
   foreclose competition in the "Web browser" market. MS Br. at 65, 69,
   80-83. Moreover, because IE is included in Windows at no charge, there
   is no forced purchase of a separate tied product, as required by tying
   law. Id. at 80-81 (citing cases). As the Supreme Court recognized in
   Jefferson Parish, "every refusal to sell two products separately cannot
   be said to restrain competition." 466 U.S. at 11. Thus, the legality of
   an alleged tie-in "depends on its competitive consequences, not whether
   it can be labeled `tying.'" Id. at 21 n.34; accord S. Card & Novelty,
   Inc. v. Lawson Mardon Label, Inc., 138 F.3d 869, 874-75 (11th Cir.
   1998); Smith Mach. Co. v. Hesston Corp., 878 F.2d 1290, 1295 (10th Cir.
   1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1073 (1990). If the "competitive
   consequences" of an arrangement are not those to which the tying rule
   is addressed, "then it should not be condemned irrespective of its
   label." Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 21 n.34. As plaintiffs themselves
   acknowledge, "the prohibition on tying is concerned with foreclosure of
   competition on the merits in the tied product." Pls. Br. at 99.
   Microsoft's inclusion of IE in Windows did not foreclose competition on
   the merits in developing and marketing Web browsing software. Unlike
   Jefferson Parish, where a surgical patient could be anesthetized by
   only one anesthesiologist, Windows users are free to install Navigator
   on their computers and use it instead of, or in addition to, IE. - 15 -
   Plaintiffs do not contest the testimony of Netscape's CEO, James
   Barksdale, that Navigator is "perfectly interoperable" with Windows.
   10/22/98 pm Tr. at 51-52. Nor do plaintiffs deny that OEMs are free to
   preinstall Navigator on their computers and that many OEMs in fact do
   so. Pls. Br. at 74. And plaintiffs do not dispute that a user who
   obtains a personal computer on which Navigator is not preinstalled can
   use IE (or other software) to download a free copy of Navigator from
   the Internet. As Microsoft explained, MS Br. at 81, there is no
   financial disincen- tive for such a user to switch to different Web
   browsing software, or to use both IE and Navigator, because both are
   available free. Chase ¶¶ 162-65. Even if a Windows user does not want
   to download Navigator from the Internet for some reason, he or she
   would have no diffi- culty obtaining a copy of Navigator from another
   source. Schmalensee ¶¶ 373-78. As Netscape has repeatedly boasted,
   Navigator is "ubiquitous." 10/21/98 pm Tr. at 14. In short, plaintiffs
   did not-and cannot-establish that Microsoft's inclusion of IE in
   Windows prevented Netscape from distributing Navigator broadly and
   seeking to persuade consumers to use it. Cf. Roy B. Taylor Sales, Inc.
   v. Hollymatic Corp., 28 F.3d 1379, 1383 n.23 (5th Cir. 1994). The low
   usage shares of IE 1 and IE 2 demonstrate that Microsoft's inclusion of
   Web browsing software in Windows does not itself produce competitive
   success, much less foreclose competition on the merits in the putative
   "Web browser" market. See generally Schmalensee ¶ 524. Every copy of
   Windows 95 that was distributed through the OEM channel between August
   1995 and August 1996 included either IE 1 or IE 2, Allchin ¶ 322, and
   OEMs were not permitted to modify Windows by removing the IE icon from
   the Windows desktop, Rose ¶¶ 25- 31; Kempin ¶ 69. Although Microsoft
   shipped tens of millions of copies of Windows 95 during that period,
   "less than 5% of people accessing the Web were using Internet
   Explorer." Allchin ¶ 322. IE's usage share continued to languish in
   single digits until Microsoft dramatically - 16 - improved the quality
   of the Web browsing software included in Windows 95. See Schmalensee ¶¶
   288-89; Chase ¶¶ 135-36. Plaintiffs have never overcome the intuitively
   obvious fact that it was the improved quality of IE, not its inclusion
   in the operating system, that was principally responsible for
   Navigator's declining usage share. II. The District Court's Monopoly
   Maintenance Ruling Should Be Reversed. Plaintiffs admit that the
   principal basis for the district court's monopoly maintenance ruling
   was its finding that Microsoft improperly foreclosed Netscape from the
   OEM and IAP channels of distribution. E.g., Pls. Br. at 79 (district
   court found that only the "OEM and IAP components" of Microsoft's
   conduct independently violated Section 2). The district court held that
   Microsoft foreclosed the IAP channel by entering into promotion and
   distribution agree- ments with IAPs and foreclosed the OEM channel by
   tying IE to Windows (i.e., not permitting OEMs to modify the operating
   system to remove "user access" to Web browsing functionality). United
   States v. Microsoft Corp., 87 F. Supp. 2d 30, 39-42 (D.D.C. 2000). The
   district court, however, rejected plaintiffs' claim that Microsoft's
   agreements with IAPs unreasonably restrained trade in violation of
   Section 1. And it is equally clear, as explained above, that
   Microsoft's inclusion of Web browsing software in Windows did not
   amount to an unreasonable restraint of trade either. Plaintiffs cite no
   authority for their assertion that conduct that does not unreasonably
   restrain trade under Section 1-because it is not exclusionary-can
   nevertheless be "anticompetitive" under Section 2. Nor do they respond
   to Microsoft's argument, based on settled Supreme Court case law, that
   "`[c]oncerted activity subject to § 1 is judged more sternly than
   unilateral activity under § 2' because `[c]oncerted activity inherently
   is fraught with anticompetitive risk.'" MS Br. at 97 (quoting
   Copperweld Corp. v. Indep. Tube Corp., 467 - 17 - U.S. 752, 768-69
   (1984) (emphasis added)). Stripped of its two principal
   pillars-foreclosure of the OEM and IAP channels-there is little left of
   plaintiffs' monopoly maintenance claim. A. Microsoft Does Not Possess
   "Monopoly Power." Plaintiffs agree that "monopoly power is the `power
   to control prices or exclude competi- tion.'" Pls. Br. at 51 (quoting
   Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 481
   (1992)). Microsoft does not possess such power in a properly-defined
   product market. 1. Products Need Not Be Complete Substitutes To Be
   Included in the Same Product Market. The district court adopted the
   narrowest possible product market: "Intel-compatible PC operating
   systems." 87 F. Supp. 2d at 36. The district court thus excluded not
   only competitive operating systems such as Apple's Mac OS, but also the
   two middleware technologies- Navigator and Java-that were the focus of
   plaintiffs' monopoly maintenance claim and that were found to be the
   most serious competitive threats to Microsoft's operating systems. 84
   F. Supp. 2d at 28-30 (FF 68-77). Plaintiffs do not cite a single case
   in which the most serious competitive threats to an alleged monopoly
   product were excluded from the relevant product market. The antitrust
   laws do not countenance such a restrictive approach to market
   definition. Although they state that Navigator and Java "threatened the
   Windows monopoly," Pls. Br. at 53, plaintiffs argue that the district
   court properly excluded middleware from the relevant product market
   because middleware is "a complement to, rather than a substitute for,
   an oper- ating system," id. at 54. Plaintiffs acknowledge, however,
   that one of the principal functions of an operating system is to
   "serve[] as a platform for applications." Id. at 9. And they similarly
   argue that the platform characteristics of Web browsing software are a
   "critical dimension" of its value. Id. at 90. As a result, middleware
   "is not only a complementary product, but also is a potential
   substitute for a crucial function of the operating system: [it] could
   serve as a platform - 18 - for software applications developers." AOL,
   CCIA, ProComp & SIIA Br. at 15. Indeed, that is the central tenet of
   plaintiffs' monopoly maintenance claim. Plaintiffs argue that the
   district court "properly excluded middleware from the market" because
   "no middleware product currently serves the same purposes as the
   Windows operating system." Pls. Br. at 53. The Sherman Act does not
   require, however, that "products be fungible to be considered in the
   relevant market." United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351
   U.S. 377, 394 (1956). If the law were otherwise, "only physically
   identical products would be part of the market," id., which would
   result in too narrow a market in which to measure an alleged
   monopolist's power. See also United States v. Continental Can Co., 378
   U.S. 441, 457 (1964) ("complete inter-industry competitive overlap need
   not be shown"). Courts have rejected efforts to exclude from the
   relevant product market partial substi- tutes that significantly
   constrain a defendant's power over price. For example, in an antitrust
   action brought by Transamerica against IBM, the court rejected
   Transamerica's attempt to limit the relevant product market to complete
   computer systems (i.e., the combination of hardware and software needed
   to satisfy a customer's data processing requirements): Transamerica's
   definition of the systems market is, however, too narrow. Only
   suppliers of complete systems are included, suppliers of parts of
   systems are ig- nored. Firms which offer the user parts of systems have
   become a major compe- titive force in the computer industry, and,
   because they significantly constrain IBM's power to control the price
   of the systems it sells, a market definition that ignores them is
   incorrect. In re IBM Peripheral EDP Devices Antitrust Litig., 481 F.
   Supp. 965, 977-78 (N.D. Cal. 1979) [hereinafter Transamerica], aff'd
   sub nom. Transamerica Computer Co. v. IBM, 698 F.2d 1377 (9th Cir.),
   cert. denied, 464 U.S. 955 (1983). As the Transamerica court properly
   observed, "A market definition should `recognize competition where, in
   fact, competition exists,' and should include all significant
   competition even though that competition differs in form or nature."
   Id. at - 19 - 978 (footnotes omitted) (quoting Brown Shoe Co. v. United
   States, 370 U.S. 294, 326 (1962)). "By assuming that only manufacturers
   offering complete systems compete with IBM," the court stated,
   Transamerica ignores a "significant constraining force." Id. Plaintiffs
   ignore a significant constraining force on Microsoft by arguing that
   only complete operating systems (indeed, only operating systems that
   run on a particular type of microprocessor) compete with Windows. The
   relevant market inquiry "boils down to whether there are products that
   restrain a defendant's ability to act without regard for other
   manufacturers and suppliers." ILC Peripherals Leasing Corp. v. IBM, 458
   F. Supp. 423, 428 (N.D. Cal. 1978), aff'd sub nom. Memorex Corp. v.
   IBM, 636 F.2d 1188 (9th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 972 (1981).
   Competing middleware technologies constrain Microsoft's actions and
   thus must be included in the relevant product market. MS Br. at 84-88.
   As Microsoft has explained, the only sensible product market definition
   includes all platforms for developing and running applications. Id. at
   87 2. Plaintiffs Have Not Satisfied Their Burden of Establishing
   Significant Barriers to Entry. Plaintiffs do not deny that they bore
   the burden of proving that there are significant bar- riers to entry
   into the putative market. See United States v. Baker Hughes Inc., 908
   F.2d 981, 987-89 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Although plaintiffs now insist that
   they "alleged and proved other barriers," Pls. Br. at 57, the district
   court's findings leave no doubt that it found only one barrier here-the
   applications barrier to entry, see 84 F. Supp. 2d at 19-23 (FF 34,
   36-50). The nature of the purported applications barrier to entry is
   clear from plaintiffs' brief: consumers currently prefer Windows over
   competing platforms because it supports a large array of compatible
   applications (the so-called "network effect"). Pls. Br. at 57, 58; see
   also 84 F. Supp. 2d at 19-20, 23 (FF 37, 50). As plaintiffs
   acknowledge, a critical attribute of an operating system is its ability
   to run applications. Pls. Br. at 9. Windows is successful because
   Microsoft - 20 - has excelled at developing innovative platform
   technologies, distributing those technologies broadly and persuading
   ISVs to create applications that utilize them. Maritz ¶¶ 124-86.
   Although plaintiffs quote this Court's statement that "`[a]ny market
   condition that makes entry more costly or time-consuming . . . should
   be considered a barrier to entry,'" Pls. Br. at 58 (quoting S. Pac.
   Communications, 740 F.2d at 1001), they fail to cite a single case in
   which consumer demand for an attribute of a product (here, support for
   a variety of applications) alone was found to consti- tute a barrier to
   entry. Plaintiffs' defense of the district court's "empirical evidence"
   that supposedly supports the applications barrier to entry is equally
   unpersuasive. See 84 F. Supp. 2d at 22-23 (FF 45-50). Plaintiffs note
   that the district court rejected Microsoft's assertion that "the Linux
   `open source' OS has created a `serious platform threat to Windows,'"
   Pls. Br. at 58, but they do not dispute that Netscape was able to mount
   a "serious platform threat" to Windows within a year of its formation
   as a six-person startup, MS Br. at 94. In addition, plaintiffs do not
   deny that Linux, which was initially written by a Finnish graduate
   student in his spare time, was able to enter the putative market and
   now competes with Windows, particularly as a server operating system.
   84 F. Supp. 2d at 23 (FF 50). Even if Linux has not yet made
   significant inroads as a desktop operating system, it "can nevertheless
   exert competitive pressure on that market." Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at
   988. Lastly, plaintiffs do not even try to reconcile their assertion
   that ISVs have no incentive to write applications for platforms other
   than Windows with their proffered basis for breaking up Microsoft-i.e.,
   their contention that after the breakup, "AppsCo" would have an
   incentive to port its applications "to other platforms, such as Linux
   or sub-PC-operating systems installed on personal digital assistants or
   wireless telephones." Pls. Br. at 121. If the only thing preventing -
   21 - Microsoft from "respond[ing] to ordinary market incentives to port
   its powerful and widely used applications" to other platforms such as
   Linux is "a stake in the Windows monopoly," id. (em- phasis added),
   then the thousands of ISVs around the world with no such stake are
   presumably acting in accordance with those "ordinary market incentives"
   already. 3. Microsoft's Behavior Confirms That It Faces Intense
   Competition. Plaintiffs do not dispute that Microsoft-in their view a
   monopolist protected by a virtu- ally insurmountable entry
   barrier-devotes billions of dollars annually to research and develop-
   ment, more than all its competitors. MS Br. at 89. They instead assert
   that "[a] monopolist has powerful incentives to invest in R&D to
   improve its product." Pls. Br. at 61. To the contrary, monopoly is
   "expected to result in technological stagnation. Without a competitive
   spur, the monopolist is thought not to have any incentive to innovate."
   Transamerica, 481 F. Supp. at 976- 77. Plaintiffs also do not dispute
   that the district court found that they failed to show that Microsoft
   charged a "monopoly price" for Windows. See 84 F. Supp. 2d at 27 (FF
   65). More- over, in the absence of any finding that Microsoft has
   control over productive capacity, plaintiffs cannot contend-and the
   district court did not find-that Microsoft can "raise price by reducing
   output," Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 487 (Scalia, J., dissenting), the
   hallmark of monopoly power. See Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson
   Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 233 (1993) ("Supracompetitive pricing
   entails a restriction in output."). Microsoft invests heavily in
   research and development and keeps the price of Windows low because it
   must contend not only with numerous existing and potential platform
   competitors, but also with prior versions of Windows. Because software
   never wears out, Microsoft must continue to improve Windows and price
   it attractively to give existing customers an incentive to - 22 -
   purchase a new computer or otherwise obtain a new version of the
   operating system. See MS Br. at 91. "If a dominant supplier acts
   consistent with a competitive market," as Microsoft does, "the purpose
   of the antitrust laws is amply served." United States v. Syufy Enters.,
   903 F.2d 659, 668- 69 (9th Cir. 1990). Plaintiffs place great emphasis
   on Microsoft's "market share." Pls. Br. at 55-56. Given the nature of
   competition in the software industry, it is not surprising-and not at
   all indicative of "monopoly power" in the antitrust sense-that one firm
   has a large share of sales. 84 F. Supp. 2d at 25-26 (FF 59);
   Schmalensee ¶¶ 32-36, 63-73. Software firms compete for leadership in
   categories such as word processors, spreadsheets, personal finance
   software and operating systems, as well as in brand new categories.
   Schmalensee ¶ 32. If successful, software firms often obtain a high
   share of a particular category and, with it, high profits given the
   very low marginal cost of reproducing software. Schmalensee ¶ 32. As
   then Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers recently explained, "the only
   incentive to produce anything" in the "new economy" is the prospect of
   earning the high profits that arise from risk taking and success in
   achieving market leadership "because without that power the price will
   be bid down to marginal cost and the high fixed costs cannot be
   recouped." Lawrence H. Summers, "The Wealth of Nations" (Remarks, May
   10, 2000). This is not to say, however, that category leaders can cease
   innovating or that they can raise the price of their products without
   fear of being displaced. Schmalensee ¶¶ 32, 36. To the contrary,
   history shows that category leaders that fail to innovate or to price
   their products attractively are frequently displaced, oftentimes by
   so-called "niche players" or by technological advances that redefine an
   entire category or render it obsolete. Schmalensee ¶¶ 66, 71-73; Maritz
   ¶¶ 75-105. - 23 - Because of this dynamic competition, the rate of
   innovation in the software industry is remarkably high, and has been an
   engine of growth and increased productivity for the Nation's economy.
   See MS Br. at 11-12. What the Transamerica court said about the
   computer industry in 1979 rings true about the software industry today:
   This is not the story of a stagnant, dominated industry. There is no
   doubt that the pace of technological progress in the computer industry
   is extraordinary. Com- mentators are fond of saying that had the auto
   industry kept the same pace over the last 30 years, a Rolls Royce would
   cost $2.50 today and would have an EPA gas rating of 2,000,000 miles
   per gallon. 481 F. Supp. at 982. By giving undue weight to plaintiffs'
   "market share" evidence and adopting a static view of the marketplace,
   the district court ignored competitive realities that require Microsoft
   to innovate and price its software attractively. B. Microsoft Did Not
   Engage in Anticompetitive Conduct. In arguing that Microsoft engaged in
   anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2, plaintiffs cite no
   cases involving conduct similar to the conduct at issue here. Rather,
   they rely on abstract definitions of "anticompetitive" or
   "exclusionary" conduct set out in cases such as Aspen Skiing Co. v.
   Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585 (1985). See Pls. Br. at
   47-48. Courts have cautioned, however, against reading cases like Aspen
   too broadly. E.g., Olympia Equip. Leasing Co. v. W. Union Tel. Co., 797
   F.2d 370, 379 (7th Cir. 1986) (Posner, J.), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 934
   (1987). Standing alone, the language in Aspen on which plaintiffs rely
   provides an insufficient basis to distinguish lawful from unlawful
   conduct-and insufficient guidance to businesspeople (and their counsel)
   attempting to conform their conduct to the dictates of the law.
   Plaintiffs fail to address any of the Section 2 cases that articulate
   controlling legal standards applicable to the specific kinds of conduct
   challenged in this case, even though such cases exist and were relied
   on by Microsoft. MS Br. at 101-02, 109-10 (citing cases involving
   technological tying and exclusive dealing claims under Section 2). - 24
   - Microsoft's conduct was not "anticompetitive" or "exclusionary" for
   one simple reason: nothing Microsoft did excluded Netscape-the focus of
   the case-from the marketplace. Although plaintiffs do not dispute this
   crucial fact, they attempt to sidestep it by claiming that "Microsoft
   took actions to exclude Navigator" from the OEM and IAP channels of
   distribution. Pls. Br. at 63. But, even assuming that Navigator was
   excluded from those two channels-which it was not-Netscape was able to
   distribute huge quantities of Navigator to consumers through numerous
   other channels. See MS Br. at 97. Unable to refute this fact,
   plaintiffs set up a straw man: they argue that Microsoft violated
   Section 2 even though "it did not completely foreclose Netscape's
   distribution of Navigator." Pls. Br. at 68 (emphasis in original); see
   also id. at 42-43, 73-76, 78-79. Microsoft has never contended that
   Section 2 requires total exclusion from the marketplace. MS Br. at 97,
   107-10. What is required is a showing of substantial exclusion, and
   that is what is missing from this case. The district court did not find
   that Microsoft excluded Netscape from any percentage of the
   marketplace, much less a substantial percentage. Instead, the district
   court expressly acknowledged that Netscape was able to distribute
   Navigator "to every PC user worldwide." 87 F. Supp. 2d at 53 (emphasis
   added). Confronted with the district court's finding that "Netscape was
   able to distribute 160 million copies of Navigator" in 1998 alone
   despite Microsoft's supposed foreclosure of the OEM and IAP channels,
   id., plaintiffs argue that Microsoft's conduct was anticompetitive
   because it supposedly prevented Navigator from being widely used. Pls.
   Br. at 31, 63, 75-76, 78. The antitrust laws, however, ensure
   competitors access to the marketplace; they do not guarantee that
   consumers will use their products. Consumers may choose not to use a
   particular product for a variety of reasons unrelated to a competitor's
   access to distribution channels. If competitors can reach the ultimate
   consumers of their products by distributing directly to them, competing
   for the - 25 - services of existing distributors or developing
   alternative distribution channels, the "[a]ntitrust laws require no
   more." Omega Envtl., Inc. v. Gilbarco, Inc., 127 F.3d 1157, 1163 (9th
   Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 812 (1998); see also Stitt Spark
   Plug Co. v. Champion Spark Plug Co., 840 F.2d 1253, 1257-58 (5th Cir.),
   cert. denied, 488 U.S. 890 (1988); Ryko Mfg. Co. v. Eden Servs., 823
   F.2d 1215, 1233-35 (8th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1026 (1988);
   Roland Mach. Co. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 749 F.2d 380, 393-95 (7th
   Cir. 1984). In any event, Navigator is widely used. The district court
   found that Navigator's installed base of users increased from 15
   million in 1996 to 33 million in December 1998, 87 F. Supp. 2d at 53;
   84 F. Supp. 2d at 103 (FF 378), the period in which Microsoft was
   supposedly engaged in a "multifaceted campaign of exclusionary
   conduct," Pls. Br. at 62. Netscape's CEO, Barksdale, testified to even
   higher figures, estimating in October 1998 that there were "somewhere
   between 40 and 70 million" Navigator users. 10/21/98 pm Tr. at 13.
   There is also no truth to plaintiffs' suggestion that the OEM and IAP
   channels are the only channels effective in generating usage of Web
   browsing software. Pls. Br. at 15, 63. Netscape informed AOL during
   AOL's due diligence investigation that "currently about 50% of our
   installed base" of users obtained Navigator by downloading it from the
   Internet. DX 2538 at 36457; see also DX 2810 at 79. As Netscape's co-
   founder, James Clark, testified, the Internet is the most efficient
   distribution system for software in the world. DX 2562 at 41-42.
   Plaintiffs ignore this evidence. Leaving aside plaintiffs' failure to
   show that Netscape was excluded from any portion of the
   marketplace-which by itself is fatal to their Section 2
   claims-plaintiffs' specific allega- tions of anticompetitive conduct
   cannot withstand scrutiny. 1. Microsoft Did Not Exclude Navigator from
   the OEM Channel. Plaintiffs assert that Microsoft "effectively exiled
   Netscape from the OEM channel." Pls. Br. at 62. First, they challenge
   the manner in which Microsoft included Web browsing software - 26 - in
   Windows 98, id. at 66, claiming that Microsoft is guilty of "predatory
   product design," id. at 67. Second, plaintiffs contend that Microsoft's
   OEM license agreements improperly prohibited "OEMs from modifying
   Windows in any unauthorized way." Id. at 68. Third, plaintiffs contend
   that Microsoft "offered OEMs valuable incentives and discounts" to
   "limit distribution of Navigator." Id. at 17-18. None of these
   contentions has merit. Predatory Product Design. Plaintiffs concede
   that "Microsoft's conduct in developing a Web browser and offering it
   to OEMs and users with Windows [was] lawful." Id. at 66. They also
   concede that Microsoft's provision of Web browsing software with
   Windows benefited consumers. Id. Recognizing that courts generally
   refuse to second-guess engineers' product design decisions in antitrust
   cases, e.g., ILC Peripherals, 458 F. Supp. at 439, plaintiffs now
   insist that they are challenging only "very limited aspects of
   Microsoft's product design," Pls. Br. at 66, an assertion that cannot
   be reconciled with their request that Microsoft be broken up and
   subjected to wide-ranging product design regulations. Plaintiffs'
   "predatory product design" claim fails for the same reasons that their
   "technological tying" claim fails under Section 1. Plaintiffs cite no
   authority for their suggestion that a different, more stringent
   standard should apply to product design decisions under Section 2 than
   applies under Section 1. To the contrary, one of the cases plaintiffs
   cite, H.J., Inc. v. ITT, 867 F.2d 1531, 1542 (8th Cir. 1989), applied
   the Section 1 standard to a tying claim under Section 2. Nor do
   plaintiffs articulate a standard that could be applied in the future to
   distinguish beneficial innovations from "predatory" design changes or
   enable software developers to deter- mine what functionality may be
   added to leading products and whether a mechanism must be provided to
   remove "user access" to that functionality. See Pls. Br. at 66. Lastly,
   plaintiffs do not deny that there are technical reasons why Windows 98
   invokes its IE components by default in a - 27 - handful of instances.
   See MS Br. at 82-83; Pls. Br. at 108-09. Plaintiffs thus provide no
   basis to outlaw the design of Windows 98, even if courts are permitted
   under the Sherman Act to evalu- ate product design decisions under some
   vague and amorphous standard. The law is settled that design changes
   that improve a product cannot violate Section 2, regardless of the
   defendant's intent. E.g., Transamerica, 481 F. Supp. at 1005 ("Mallard
   was a design adopted primarily to preclude PCM competition, but it was
   a superior design, and its effect on competition was negligible. A
   finding adverse to IBM on this aspect of its conduct would amount to
   punishment for intent alone."). To hold otherwise would chill technical
   innova- tion. That is why courts have roundly rejected allegations of
   "predatory innovation" or "preda- tory design." See Joseph Gregory
   Sidak, Debunking Predatory Innovation, 83 COLUM. L. REV. 1121, 1121 n.2
   (1983) (citing cases). Plaintiffs do not dispute that Microsoft's
   design of Windows to include Web browsing functionality improved the
   operating system and benefited consumers. Pls. Br. at 66. Plaintiffs
   contend that Microsoft lacked "a legitimate business justifi- cation"
   for its design of Windows, id. at 67, but it is plaintiffs'
   suggestion-that Microsoft was required to create a mechanism for hiding
   "user access" to useful functionality in the operating system-that
   makes no business sense. Microsoft's OEM License Agreements. Plaintiffs
   do not dispute that "Microsoft's license agreements have never
   prohibited OEMs from pre-installing programs, including Navigator, on
   their PCs and placing icons and entries for those programs on the
   Windows desk- top and in the `Start' menu." 84 F. Supp. 2d at 63 (FF
   217). Nor do they dispute that Microsoft's license agreements do "not
   forbid the OEM to set Navigator as the default browsing software." Id.
   Plaintiffs instead claim that Microsoft's license agreements are
   unlawful because they do not permit OEMs to delete or modify parts of
   Windows without authorization. Pls. Br. at 16-17. In - 28 - particular,
   plaintiffs challenge the so-called "Windows Experience" provisions of
   Microsoft's license agreements, which require that "the very first time
   a consumer turns on his or her computer, Microsoft's Windows operating
   system . . . be allowed to go through the initial startup sequence as
   designed, developed and tested by Microsoft and to display the Windows
   desktop without any aspect of that screen having been deleted by the
   OEM." Kempin ¶ 38. a. Plaintiffs concede that Microsoft's inclusion of
   Web browsing functionality in Windows did not violate the antitrust
   laws. Pls. Br. at 102. They nevertheless argue that Microsoft was
   required to permit OEMs, which act as Microsoft's distributors, to
   delete "user access" to that functionality. By claiming that Microsoft
   must permit OEMs to make unauthor- ized modifications to its
   copyrighted operating systems, plaintiffs seek to deprive Microsoft of
   its rights under federal copyright law. Contractual provisions limiting
   the ability of a licensee to modify copyrighted works without the
   licensor's permission are common in the software industry, and are
   found in the OEM license agreements of other leading operating system
   vendors. Kempin ¶ 25; see, e.g., DX 1661 at 4; DX 1777 at 102. From an
   antitrust perspective, Microsoft's possession of this legal right
   contributes to its "efficiency in the same way that possession of any
   other asset does." Neumann v. Reinforced Earth Co., 786 F.2d 424, 427
   n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1986). As this Court has explained, "the legitimate
   assertion of a legal right against a competitor, however damaging to
   the competitor, or even to competition, that may be, does not
   constitute monopolizing or attempting to monopolize within the meaning
   of the Sherman Act." Id. According to plaintiffs, "Microsoft neither
   articulated a tenable copyright theory that sup- ports its asserted
   defense, nor offered evidence to support such a theory." Pls. Br. at
   69. That assertion is demonstrably false. From the outset of the case,
   Microsoft argued that plaintiffs' - 29 - "challenges to Microsoft's
   license agreements with computer manufacturers are without legal merit
   by reason of Microsoft's rights under the federal copyright laws."
   Answer to DOJ's Compl. at 34. As Microsoft argued in seeking summary
   judgment, "[t]he `bundle of rights' possessed by the holder of a valid
   copyright includes the right to prevent unauthorized modifica- tions to
   its copyrighted work." MS Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 54. At
   trial, Microsoft introduced into evidence Certificates of Registration
   from the United States Copyright Office for both Windows 95 and Windows
   98. 2/24/99 am Tr. at 63-66; DX 813; DX 814; see also 84 F. Supp. 2d at
   66 (FF 228); Kempin ¶ 2; 2/25/99 am Tr. at 57-58. The admission of
   these copyright registrations "shift[ed] to [plaintiffs] the burden of
   proving the invalidity of the copyright[s]." Fonar Corp. v. Domenick,
   105 F.3d 99, 104 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 908 (1997).
   Plaintiffs never contended-much less proved-that Microsoft's copyrights
   are invalid. Rather, plaintiffs argue that copyright law permits a
   licensee to make "minor modifica- tions" to a copyrighted work without
   authorization from the copyright holder. See Pls. Br. at 69- 72.
   According to plaintiffs, "deleting a single icon from Windows 95" and
   "providing users with additional information in the boot sequence of
   Windows" are "minor modifications [that] would hardly frustrate the
   objectives of the Copyright Act." Id. at 72. Leaving aside the irony
   that plaintiffs contend Microsoft violated Section 2 and should be
   broken up because it did not permit OEMs to make what they now call
   "minor modifications" to Windows, plaintiffs are wrong on both the
   facts and the law. The Second Circuit's reference in Gilliam to
   "mutilation of [the] work" (quoted at Pls. Br. at 70) was not contained
   in the discussion of the copyright infringement claim, but rather in
   the discussion of the separate claim under the Lanham Act. Gilliam v.
   ABC, 538 F.2d 14, 23-24 (2d Cir. 1976). And, contrary to plaintiffs'
   assertion, Pls. Br. at 70, the Seventh Circuit in WGN did not find that
   the "teletext" included by WGN in the vertical - 30 - blanking interval
   of its 9:00 p.m. news broadcast was a "substantial portion of the
   work." WGN Cont'l Broad. Co. v. United Video, Inc., 693 F.2d 622,
   624-28 (7th Cir. 1982). Nor can the modifications at issue be dismissed
   as inconsequential. E.g., Kempin ¶ 37. As plaintiffs acknowledge,
   "[b]etween 1995 and 1999, Microsoft spent more than $100 million each
   year" developing the IE technologies in Windows. Pls. Br. at 15. Having
   made that sub- stantial investment, Microsoft had a legitimate business
   interest in preventing OEMs from modi- fying Windows to deny "user
   access" to the functionality provided by IE. In addition, "Microsoft
   advertises Windows as including Internet Explorer, and many product
   reviews of Windows 98 discuss that feature of the operating system."
   Kempin ¶ 69. Plaintiffs do not deny that "considerable customer
   confusion would result and Microsoft's brand image could suffer if
   customers purchasing a new computer preinstalled with Windows could not
   find and utilize the Internet Explorer functionality that Microsoft
   advertises as part of the operating system." Kempin ¶ 69. b. Wholly
   apart from Microsoft's rights under federal copyright law, the
   challenged provisions of Microsoft's license agreements do not limit
   Netscape's access to the OEM channel. See DX 10 at 48339. Plaintiffs do
   not dispute that "O EMs were permitted to pre-install Navigator on PCs
   and that many OEMs did so." Pls. Br. at 74. In fact, plaintiffs' own
   exhibits show that Compaq, Fujitsu, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and
   Sony-six of the world's largest OEMs-distributed Navigator on some of
   their personal computers. GX 421 at 680; GX 2116 at 201070-71; see also
   Kempin ¶ 21. Rather, plaintiffs contend that, as the quality of IE
   improved, many OEMs decided either not to preinstall Navigator or to
   feature it less prominently on their personal computers because Windows
   already included IE. See Pls. Br. at 20, 74-75. Even if true, that
   contention does not establish an antitrust violation. - 31 - To support
   their claim that Navigator was "exiled" from the OEM channel,
   plaintiffs challenge the authenticity of the document prepared during
   AOL's due diligence investigation of Netscape that reports that
   Navigator was present on "22% of OEM shipments." DX 2440 at 341778.
   Plaintiffs assert that "[n]othing in the record explains the source or
   method of the `[e]stimate' in this anonymous document, which was not
   subject to cross-examination." Pls. Br. at 75; see also id. at 78. To
   the contrary, Barry Schuler, a senior AOL executive, testified that
   this so-called "anonymous document" represents a "summary of the
   findings and proposed finan- cials and operating plans" resulting from
   AOL's November 1998 due diligence investigation of Netscape. DX 2810 at
   74-75. Schuler also stated that AOL used this document to "make our
   final determination of whether to proceed ahead with" the $10 billion
   acquisition of Netscape. DX 2810 at 75. Plaintiffs themselves
   identified the document in their proposed findings of fact as "the due
   diligence report by Goldman Sachs on the Netscape/AOL transaction,"
   Pls. Joint Proposed Findings of Fact ¶ 380.5.i, and the district court
   credited the statement in the document that Netscape distributed 160
   million copies of Navigator in 1998, 87 F. Supp. 2d at 53. No
   Restriction on Distribution of Navigator. Plaintiffs suggest that
   Microsoft's OEM license agreements "restricted Navigator's
   distribution." Pls. Br. at 73. That suggestion is contra- dicted by the
   facts, as the district court found. 84 F. Supp. 2d at 63 (FF 217).
   Plaintiffs also suggest that Microsoft dissuaded Compaq, Gateway and
   IBM from distributing Navigator. Pls. Br. at 18. In fact, plaintiffs go
   so far as to state that Microsoft had an exclusive contract with Compaq
   requiring it to ship only IE. Id. at 77. These statements are likewise
   false. The undis- puted evidence establishes that Compaq, Gateway and
   IBM all distribute Navigator. Kempin ¶ 21; 2/19/99 am Tr. at 49-50;
   6/9/99 pm Tr. at 63. Furthermore, Compaq's John Rose and - 32 - Stephen
   Decker both testified that Microsoft never limited in any way Compaq's
   ability to preinstall Navigator on its new computers. Rose ¶¶ 32-33; DX
   2564 at 44, 45, 50. 2. Microsoft Did Not Exclude Navigator from the IAP
   Channel. Plaintiffs contend that Microsoft's agreements with ISPs and
   OLSs (collectively referred to by the district court as "IAPs")
   improperly excluded Navigator from an important distribution channel in
   violation of Section 2. They concede, however, that the district court
   rejected their claim that those same agreements violated Section 1.
   Pls. Br. at 5. They also do not dispute that courts apply exactly the
   same standard to alleged exclusive dealing agreements under Section 2
   as they do under Section 1. MS Br. at 109-10 (citing cases). In an
   attempt to salvage their monopoly maintenance claim, plaintiffs argue
   that the district court's "Section 1 ruling addressed the effects of
   Microsoft's conduct in the Web browser market, but the Section 2
   monopoly maintenance violation concerns the operating system market."
   Pls. Br. at 77-78 (emphasis in original). This is pure sophistry. Under
   plaintiffs' theory of the case-adopted by the district court-the
   challenged conduct had an anticompetitive effect in the alleged
   operating system market because it allegedly prevented Navigator from
   becoming the "standard" Web browsing software in a separate "Web
   browser" market. Id. at 14. Thus, accepting plaintiffs' theory, if the
   challenged agreements did not unreasonably retrain trade in the alleged
   "Web browser" market-as the district court concluded-they could not
   possibly have had a derivative anticompetitive effect in the alleged
   operating system market. Plaintiffs also take issue with the fact that,
   notwithstanding Microsoft's agreements with IAPs, Netscape was able to
   distribute large quantities of Navigator through the IAP channel. Once
   again, they seek to dismiss as an "anonymous document" (Pls. Br. at 78)
   the same report summarizing AOL's due diligence investigation of
   Netscape, which estimated that Navigator accounted for a "24% share of
   top 20 ISP's distribution." DX 2440 at 341778. Plaintiffs argue - 33 -
   that this document "establish[es] only that, after Microsoft dropped
   some of its restrictions in the spring of 1998, Navigator was not
   totally excluded from the IAP channel." Pls. Br. at 78. Con- trary to
   plaintiffs' assertion, Navigator was never excluded from the IAP
   channel. At a time when Microsoft was struggling to obtain "measurable
   browser share," DX 1545 at 2006380, Microsoft entered into the
   challenged agreements with only ten of the more than 4,500 ISPs in
   North America and with four leading OLSs, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 72-73, 85
   (FF 256, 305); Myhrvold ¶ 8. The agreements expressly permitted the
   IAPs to distribute Navigator to their sub- scribers upon request, MS
   Br. at 34, 35, and Navigator's share of the subscriber base of IAPs did
   not vary significantly depending on whether the IAP had entered into an
   agreement with Microsoft, Schmalensee ¶¶ 445-62 & App. D ¶¶ 100-14. To
   the extent Microsoft's ISP agree- ments could be said to have had any
   adverse effect on Navigator's distribution, that effect disappeared
   when Microsoft waived the distribution provisions of those agreements
   in April 1998, approximately 18 months after they went into effect.
   Myhrvold ¶ 91. 3. Plaintiffs' Other Allegations Do Not Amount to a
   Section 2 Violation. Plaintiffs also premise their monopoly maintenance
   claim on (i) Microsoft's agreements with certain ICPs and ISVs, (ii)
   aspects of Microsoft's Java implementation, and (iii) Microsoft's 1997
   technology agreement with Apple. See Pls. Br. at 42, 65, 79-83. They
   concede, however, that the district court concluded that these matters
   "failed to have a `significant exclusionary impact,'" and thus cannot
   "be independent bases for liability" under Section 2. Id. at 81 (empha-
   sis in original). Plaintiffs nevertheless argue that "a series of
   actions, which standing alone would not be unlawful, can . . ., in
   combination, result in a violation of the Sherman Act." Id. at 82. The
   Federal Circuit recently rejected a similar "monopoly broth" theory in
   Intergraph Corp. v. Intel Corp., 195 F.3d 1346, 1366-67 (Fed. Cir.
   1999), a case plaintiffs ignore. Plaintiffs not only are - 34 - wrong
   on the law, see MS Br. at 112-14; they also have not shown that any of
   the challenged acts were anticompetitive. Microsoft's Agreements with
   Certain ICPs and ISVs. The district court expressly found that
   plaintiffs failed to prove that Microsoft's agreements with the 24 ICPs
   included in the Channel Bar "actually had a substantial, deleterious
   impact on Navigator's usage share." 84 F. Supp. 2d at 92 (FF 332). That
   finding defeats any claim that those agreements had antitrust signi-
   ficance, under Section 1 or Section 2. Similarly, plaintiffs' assertion
   that Microsoft "contractually required ISVs to use Internet
   Explorer-specific technologies in return for timely and commercially
   necessary technical infor- mation about Windows" and "precluded
   important ISVs from distributing Navigator with their products" is
   false and not supported by any testimony. Pls. Br. at 30 (citing GX
   2071 & GX 2400). Microsoft entered into the agreements in question-the
   so-called "First Wave" agree- ments-with only a fraction of the
   thousands of ISVs that write applications for Windows. 84 F. Supp. 2d
   at 93 (FF 339). Pursuant to those agreements, the ISVs received certain
   technical and marketing support from Microsoft in exchange for their
   commitment to, among other things, use IE 4 as "the default browser" if
   their application's user in
