   The ALIAS-II instrument is a 2-channel version of the ALIAS-I (ER-2)
   instrument, with identical electronics, dewar configuration, and
   instrument- and data processing- software, built under funding from
   NASAÂ’s High-Speed Research Program to measure N[2]O, CH[4], and H[2]O
   on the UAV Perseus, and reconfigured to fly on a lightweight balloon
   gondola. In this configuration, ALIAS-II measures these gases in a very
   clean, open path defined as the 5-m round-trip from nose-to-wing (UAV)
   or a 64-meter (to 128-meter) open cradle optical cell (balloon). The
   instrument weighs about 65 lbs in its balloon configuration, and has
   alternate capability for HCl and NO[2]. ALIAS-II has made 7 balloon
   flights out of Ft.Sumner, New Mexico, Fairbanks, Alaska, and Juarzerio
   del

   photochemistry and transport.
