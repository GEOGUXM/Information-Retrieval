   Help Us Beta Test CSB's Chemical Incident Reports Center

   We're building a new information service for you. While the final
   touches are being applied, we'd like feedback from you. We invite you
   take a look, kick the tires, and put this dynamic database to work for
   you.

   After you've had a chance to use the CIRC you can send us any
   observations by email using our comments form.

   Thanks for your assistance.

   What is the purpose of the Chemical Incident Reports Center (CIRC)?

   Throughout the day, every day, the Chemical Safety Board (CSB) receives
   initial reports about chemical incidents that have occurred around the
   world. The information comes from official government sources, the news
   media, eyewitnesses and others.

   The CSB
     * incorporates incident information into databases that it maintains.
     * shares incident information with other government agencies and
       chemical safety stakeholders
     * makes decisions about whether to deploy investigation teams based
       on supplementary information developed after the initial report is
       received.

   The sheer volume of incident reports received each day exceeds the
   investigative resources of the CSB or any other single organization.
   Yet sharing knowledge of these incidents may make it possible for
   others to take actions that may contribute to improving chemical
   safety.

   Therefore, the Chemical Safety Board has committed resources to create
   and maintain the Chemical Incident Reports Center (CIRC). This dynamic,
   searchable online database of chemical incidents, although subject to
   limitations inherent in any compilation of information of this type
   (see disclaimer below), may enable or inspire actions by a researcher,
   a government agency or others in support of improving chemical safety.

   Disclaimer: The Chemical Incident Reports Center (CIRC) is an
   information service provided by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard
   Investigation Board (CSB). Users of this service should note that the
   contents of the CIRC are not intended to be a comprehensive listing of
   all incidents that have occurred; many incidents go unreported or are
   not entered into the database. Therefore, it is not appropriate to use
   the CIRC database to perform statistical analysis that extends
   conclusions beyond the content of the CIRC. Also, although the CSB
   never knowingly posts inaccurate information, the CSB is unable to
   independently verify all information that it receives from its various
   sources, much of which is based on initial reports. CIRC users should
   also note that the CSB receives more comprehensive reports about
   incidents that occur in the U.S.; comparisons made between U.S.
   incidents and those in other nations should take this fact into
   consideration. Users of data from the CIRC are requested to attach this
   disclaimer to the data and cite http://www.chemsafety.gov/circ as the
   source. We welcome your feedback about this service to circ@csb.gov or
   through our beta test user comment form.
