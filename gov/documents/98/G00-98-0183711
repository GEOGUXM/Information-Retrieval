               The science connection you've been waiting for!
  High school students, teachers and physicsts working together on physics
                              research projects

     QuarkNet is a teacher professional development program funded by the
     National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy.
     Teachers work on particle physics experiments during a summer and
     join a cadre of scientists and teachers working to introduce some
     aspects of their research into their classrooms. This allows
     tomorrow's particle physicists to peek over the shoulder of today's
     experimenters.

     You can use the following material in your classroom to guide
     students as they investigate an experiment.
