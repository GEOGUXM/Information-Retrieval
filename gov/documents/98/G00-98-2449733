      The following are official, searchable publication databases authorized
      for dissemination to the public via GPO Access. The origin of these
      databases begins with the Legislative process in both the U.S. House of
      Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Some of the publications listed
      are published by other Government entities. If Congress is not the
      publisher, the search page accessed by clicking on a listed publication
      reveals the entity with publishing responsibility.
