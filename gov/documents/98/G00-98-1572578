   In November 1986, California voters approved an initiative to address
   growing concerns about exposures to toxic chemicals. That initiative
   became The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986,
   better known by its original name: Proposition 65.

   Proposition 65 requires the Governor to publish a list of chemicals
   that are known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth
   defects or other reproductive harm. This list must be updated at least
   once a year.
