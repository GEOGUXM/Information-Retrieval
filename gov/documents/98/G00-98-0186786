                             Research Interests

   Nuclear physics and nuclear data for a variety of applications
   important to the Laboratory and Nation, including: stockpile
   stewardship; non-proliferation; rare-isotope-accelerator and
   astrophysics; external beam radiotherapy; nuclear criticality; and
   accelerator-driven systems. Nuclear reaction theory and modeling for
   understanding statistical systems, including quantum and semiclassical
   preequilibrium models, Hauser-Feshbach theory, fission theory,
   photonuclear reactions. Developing large nuclear reaction codes to
   model nuclear reactions and scattering. Development of nuclear
   databases for representing evaluated cross sections for use in
   radiation transport simulation codes.
