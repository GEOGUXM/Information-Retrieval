                        15th William R. Cherry Award
     __________________________________________________________________

   This award is named in honor of William R. Cherry, a founder of the
   Photovoltaic community. In the 1950s, he was instrumental in
   establishing solar cells as the ideal power source for space satellites
   and for recognizing, advocating, and nurturing the use of photovoltaic
   systems for terrestrial applications. The award was instituted in l980,
   shortly after Bill Cherry's death.

   This award is presented at each IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists
   Conference (PVSC) and recognizes those who have made outstanding
   contributions to the advancement of photovoltaic science and
   technology. The recipient is selected by the William R Cherry
   Committee. This committee is composed of past PVSC conference
   chairpersons and past recipients of the award. Those nominated for the
   award do not participate in the process. Please send any nominations
   for the next William R. Cherry award to: Prof. Adolf Goetzberger,
   Fraunhofer ISE, Oltmanstrasse 5, D-79100 Freiburg, GERMANY Fax:
   +497614588116; E-mail: goetzb@ise.fhg.de

                 This year, the award will be presented to:

                           Dr. Christopher Wronski

   Dr. Wronski is the Leonhard Professor of Microelectronic Materials and
   Devices with a joint appointment in Electrical Engineering, Engineering
   Science and Mechanics, and the Materials Research Laboratory. Before
   joining the Pennsylvania State University in 1987, he carried out
   research on optoelectronic materials and devices in industrial
   laboratories between 1963 and 1986. In 1976, Dr. Wronski co-invented
   with Dr. D. Carlson the hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cell. This
   important development in solar energy led to worldwide effort in
   applied and fundamental research of amorphous silicon-based
   technologies. His work resulted in several key discoveries of novel
   optoelectronic phenomena (e.g., the Staebler-Wronski Effect) as well as
   improved understanding of new materials such as amorphous silicon-based
   superlattices. For this pioneering work on amorphous silicon solar
   cells, he was awarded the prestigious IEEE Morris Libermann Memorial
   Award in 1984.

   Dr. Wronski has been internationally recognized for his scientific
   papers on optoelectronic materials and devices, an area in which he has
   more than two hundred publications and ten patents. From 1991 to 1995,
   Dr. Wronski was the coordinator and leader of the Stable Materials
   Advisory Team, which was a nationwide research effort on improvement of
   stability in amorphous silicon materials and devices. In 1995, Prof.
   Wronski received a fellowship from the Japanese Society for the
   Promotion of Science to carry out research in Japanese laboratories. In
   December 1995, he was recognized by the Department of Energy for
   "outstanding contributions and leadership in photovoltaic research and
   development."

   The William R. Cherry award will be presented to Dr. Wronski on Tuesday
   evening, September 19, 2000, at the Cherry Award Ceremony. The ceremony
   will begin at 6:30 p.m. in the Egan Center Ballroom and will be
   followed by a reception in the exhibit area, sponsored by the
   exhibitors, for all attendees and their accompanying spouse or guest.
