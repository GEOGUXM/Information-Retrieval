   If you have moved or changed your name, you are required by law (Title
   16, California Code of Regulations, Section 1409.1), to notify the BRN
   within 30 days of the change.

   If you are changing your address you must provide the Board with
   written notification, that is to include your name, RN number, Social
   Security Number, the old address, and the new address.

   If you are changing your name please provide the above information,
   along with your old name, new name, and a copy of the legal
   documentation. If you would like a card that reflects the new name, you
   must send back the card that has the old name, and the replacement card
   fee of $30.00 to the Board of Registered Nursing, Attn: Renewals Unit.

   If you hold a permanent California RN license, and would like to update
   your address online please click here.
