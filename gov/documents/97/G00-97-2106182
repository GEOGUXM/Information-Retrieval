                                  Why PDF?

   About PDF
   Portable Document Format (PDF) is the de facto standard for electronic
   distribution of documents because it's the best way to keep the look
   and feel intact. PDF files are compact, cross platform and can be
   viewed by anyone with a free Acrobat Reader.

   Additional benefits of using PDF:
   PDF files can be distributed globally via e-mail, the Web,corporate
   intranets or CD-ROM. Acrobat Reader's navigation and zoom features
   enable closer review of PDF file text and images, even within your
   browser! PDF files can be easily viewed and printed a page at a time.
   Links, annotations, live forms, security options, video, and sound can
   be added to PDF files for enhanced online viewing with Adobe(R) Acrobat
   3.0.
