San Francisco Bay Trail Grant Summary

     1999-2000 Regional Development Program

     __________________________________________________________________

    The San Francisco Bay Trail competitive grant program is designed to:
     * speed development of high priority, ready-to-build sections;
     * provide strong leverage with significant local and in-kind matches;
     * employ the California Conservation Corps wherever possible for
       construction, landscaping and maintenance;
     * encourage creative solutions and foster new partnerships; and
     * offer limited funds for planning/feasibility studies to overcome
       long-standing obstacles to trail development.


   Recently, 13 applications were received for trail projects all around
   the Bay Area. Combined, the requests would provide over 15 miles of new
   trail, several new bridge crossings, and would leverage over $8 million
   in total project costs. Following, in counter-clockwise order starting
   in the North Bay, is a summary of 9 stellar Bay Trail projects that
   received "Phase l" allocation by the Coastal Conservancy Board on April
   27, 2000.


   The City of San Rafael, in partnership with the Marin Conservation
   League and the Marin Community Foundation, will build 1,000 linear feet
   of Bay Trail in Shoreline Park including an asphalt pedestrian and
   bicycle path, a gravel jogging path and a landscaped park. A grant
   award of $140,000 leveraged 50% by outside funds will extend an already
   improved and well-used portion of the Bay Trail increasing the
   opportunities for nearby residents and businesses to enjoy expansive
   views along the Bay.

   The City of Mountain View will conduct a planning study for a .75-mile
   extension of the Bay Trail across the northern end of Moffett Field.
   The $30,000 grant will be used to advance the planning and future
   development of this critical Bay Trail segment across a federal
   facility.

 In partnership with Cargill and Lockheed Martin, the City of Sunnyvale
 will provide access to one mile of new Bay Trail. The $55,000 grant is
 matched 50% by the City and Lockheed Martin. The project will connect
 with the popular Bay Trail segment in Sunnyvale Baylands Park and
 provide new access to Lockheed property, serving as an extension of
 this well-used recreation and transportation corridor.
                                                                       Sunnyview

   Alviso Marina

   Bay Trail development and improved amenities at Alviso Marina County
   Park are part of the Santa Clara County Parks and Recreation Department
   master plan for the former marina basin. A grant award of $150,000 will
   contribute to the construction of a new boardwalk creating a Bay Trail
   loop around the park and an enhanced destination area for Bay Trail
   users.

   The City of San Leandro received a $60,000 planning grant for a
   300-foot bicycle/pedestrian bridge across a slough from Oyster Bay
   Regional Shoreline and a 600-foot bicycle/pedestrian path north of the
   bridge in San Leandro. The planning study will address the existing gap
   between Oyster Bay Regional Park and the Bay Trail alignment within the
   vicinity of Oakland International Airport.

   Oakland

           The Port of Oakland will construct 1.1 miles of Bay Trail along the
           outer edges of Oakland International Airport with a $250,000 grant
           award matched by 80% outside funding. The project will provide
           connection to existing Bay Trail alignment north along Martin Luther
           King, Jr. Regional Shoreline with future connections south to Oyster
           Bay Regional Shoreline and continuous access to the Hayward Regional
           Shoreline.

   The City of Richmond is planning for construction and improvement of 5
   miles of Bay Trail from Marina Bay Harbor to Wildcat Creek as well as a
   spur trail to Miller-Knox Regional Shoreline. A $400,000 grant
   supported by 50% non-grant funding will facilitate the project.
   Completion of this segment will result in a continuous Bay Trail
   alignment from Point Isabel to Wildcat Creek, a distance of
   approximately 13 miles, providing much-needed community access to the
   shoreline and serving as a critical transportation corridor.

   Pinole

          Through a collaborative effort involving the East Bay Regional Park
          District and the cities of Pinole and Hercules, a 1/2-mile segment of
          new Bay Trail will be constructed linking two regional parks along the
          Bay. Using a grant award of $100,000 and leveraging 48% of the total
          project budget, the East Bay Regional Park District plans to construct
          a paved pathway, bikelanes and a bridge over Pinole Creek. The project
          will provide a new connection to the existing spur trail around
          Bayfront Park and will link downtown Pinole to the waterfront by
          connecting to the existing Pinole Creek spur trail.

   The City of American Canyon will conduct a trail alignment and planning
   study for 2.7 miles of Bay Trail. A $15,000 grant will be used to
   identify a preferred Bay Trail alignment along the edge of the city's
   bay wetlands as an alternative to the current alignment along Highway
   29. The new alignment will be developed on recently acquired land along
   the east side of the Napa River providing trail users with an improved
   Bay Trail experience by bringing them off-street within close proximity
   to restored wetlands.
