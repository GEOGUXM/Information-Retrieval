    Picture of the smart balloon with the transponder packaged inside the
   balloon shell rather than tethered under the balloon. This packaging of
    the transponder protects it from rain and reduces exposure to damage
                                from impact.

   1. INTRODUCTION

   With funding from the U.S. Weather Research Program (USWRP), NOAA Air
   Resources Laboratory, Field Research Division, in collaboration with
   the University of Hawaii have made improvements to the smart balloon
   (constant volume adjustable density balloon) that will make this
   platform suitable for hurricane research. The 10.3-foot diameter
   balloon shell has been redesigned to allow the transponder and sensors
   to reside inside the balloon shell to help protect them from turbulence
   and rain that may be encountered inside a hurricane. The temperature
   and relative humidity sensors are no longer passively aspirated but are
   housed in a radiation shield and are fan aspirated to increase
   accuracy. A rain gage has been added to provide information on the
   precipitation rate as the smart balloon moves through rain bands within
   a hurricane. An infrared temperature sensor has also been added to
   provide remote sea-surface temperature data.  Satellite communications
   replaces the point to point radio system to allow continuous monitoring
   of the balloon position and sensor data without requiring an aircraft
   to be in close proximity to the smart balloon.

   The improved smart balloons will be deployed as a part of a Lagrangian
   experimental strategy to better characterize the evolution of the
   energy content of the marine boundary-layer inflow to a hurricane and
   its relationship with hurricane intensity changes. This effort will be
   accomplished in cooperation with reconnaissance missions flown by the
   NOAA Hurricane Research Division.

     This cross sectional drawing shows the physical relationship of the
   balloon exterior shell, the air and helium bladders the transponder and
                                 top plate.

   2. BALLOON DESIGN

   The constant volume balloon shell is made from a high-strength fabric
   that allows the balloon to be pressurized without tearing the balloon
   and with minimal increase in the balloon volume. A high-strength fabric
   is necessary for the following reasons: 1. When pressurized to the
   maximum operating pressure, over 50,000 pounds of force are exerted on
   the balloon shell. 2. Any elasticity in the fabric requires additional
   pumping time and energy to adjust the balloon altitude.

   2.1 Transponder Protection

   With very high winds and turbulence possible inside a hurricane, the
   new smart balloon design moves the transponder inside the balloon shell
   to provide protection and added stability for the transponder.
   Designing an airtight tube inside the balloon for the transponder
   allows the balloon to better protect the transponder from; rain, impact
   with solid objects and allows the transponder enclosure tube to provide
   the function of interfacing with the internal bladders and balloon
   shell (saving weight and space). The above drawing shows the
   integration of the helium fill tube and air ballast tube into the
   transponder enclosure tube. The air ballast tube is connected to a pump
   and release valve inside the transponder to allow air to be pumped into
   or released from the ballast portion of the balloon. The helium tube is
   used only when the balloon is initially filled and is then sealed. A
   cut down device installed on the top of the balloon releases helium.


                             [Water%20Drops.jpg]

   Picture of a 50 mm wide by 37 mm high area of the Spectra balloon shell
     that has been sprayed with water.  Note that the combination of the
   tight weave of the fabric and the water repellent treatment causes the
     water to bead up and roll off the balloon rather than soak into the
                                   fabric.

   2.2 Rain Repellant Shell for Balloon

   The shell is a porous fabric that does not stop the migration of air or
   water between the exterior and interior of the balloon shell. Internal
   to the fabric shell, bladders contain the helium and air as shown in
   the drawing. However these internal bladders do not keep the balloon
   shell from absorbing substantial quantities of water when rain is
   encountered. Since rain will very likely be encountered in hurricane
   deployments, it is important to know the possible increase in balloon
   weight due to rain and provide protection or be capable of compensating
   for this eventuality.

   Two tests were conducted to determine rain loading on the balloon. The
   first test was with the outer shell of the balloon exposed directly to
   simulated rain. During the second test a waterproof plastic cover or
   skirt was used to protect the upper half of the balloon during similar
   simulated rain conditions. Testing results (see table 1 and table 2)
   show that without a protective cover the balloon weight increases about
   5500 to 6900 grams. With the waterproof plastic cover, rain loading was
   reduced to 1100 grams at a similar rate of precipitation. The ballast
   adjustment capability of the balloon is in the range of 3000 to 4000
   grams depending on meteorological conditions and conditions at launch
   time.

   weight increase as a function of precipitation rate.

   The above results indicate the necessity of providing a rain cover or
   developing a waterproof balloon shell. The balloon shells are presently
   being fabricated from the same high strength fabric with a waterproof
   treatment. This fabric (prior to sewing) has tested favorably against
   plastic at repelling water. Future testing of balloons made with only
   the waterproof fabric (gore seams may leak water) should indicate if
   balloons sewn with this fabric repel water well enough to eliminate the
   plastic cover. If the plastic cover can be eliminated, it will decrease
   the weight of the balloon by about 700 grams, reduce balloon costs and
   significantly simplify balloon inflation and launch procedures. It
   should be noted that use of a plastic cover is still a backup option.


                [Poly%20Urithane%20Film%20400%20x%20300.jpg]

    High strength yet elastic 1 mil polyurethane film is used to make the
                     new bladders for the smart balloon.

   2.3 Improved Bladders

   The previous balloon design used large weather balloons (300 and 600
   grams) inside the high strength shell to contain the helium and air
   ballast. It was necessary to treat the helium balloon with a special
   polymer prior to inflation to minimize the loss of helium through the
   permeable wall of the weather balloon. The outer weather balloon, used
   to contain the ballast air, required no treatment with the polymer.
   However, stress-induced leaks would develop over the space of a day or
   two in areas where the outer weather balloon was in contact with the
   discontinuities caused by gore seams in the shell. Testing showed that
   treating the outer balloon with the polymer could help with this
   problem but not eliminate it. The process of treating both balloons and
   the lengthy inflation procedures necessary to do this eliminated the
   initial simplicity and low cost associated with using the rubber
   weather balloons.

   Polyurethane bladders were chosen to replace the weather balloon
   bladders that were for ACE-2 because they offer very low permeability
   to helium without any special polymer treatment and provide the
   flexibility and elasticity necessary and have are not adversely
   affected by the discontinuity caused by the balloon gore seams.

   This picture shows the packaged instruments that fit inside the 6 inch
                   transponder tube up inside the balloon.

   3. INSTRUMENTATION

   Measurements made along the path of the smart balloon in a hurricane
   are an important part of this project. New instruments have been added
   to the transponder and changes have been made to others.


                   [IR%20Temperature%20480%20x%20360.jpg]

                Picture of the Apogee IR temperature sensor.

   3.1 Infrared Thermometer

   Measuring the sea surface temperature is critical in estimating the sea
   surface heat fluxes. Since the balloon is several hundred meters above
   the sea surface, it is necessary that this measurement be made
   remotely.

   An Apogee infrared temperature sensor has been added to the smart
   balloon to estimate sea- surface temperature based on the emitted
   infrared radiation. Unlike conventional thermometers, the infrared
   thermometers do not need to come in direct contact with the object or
   surface temperature being measured. The Apogee infrared sensor is
   mounted at the bottom of the transponder enclosure tube with an opening
   in the horizontal plate to allow a downward view of the sea surface.
   Accuracy of this thermometer is one degree centigrade and has a
   resolution of .1 degree centigrade. Because the sensor measures the
   temperature within the field of view, it will measure the temperature
   of any other objects that emit infrared radiation between the sensor
   and the sea surface (such as rain and sea spray).


                   [Solar%20Radiation%20480%20x%20360.jpg]

                    Licor LI200X solar radiation sensor.

   3.2 Solar Radiation

   The small solar electric cell that was used during ACE-2 in 1997, has
   been replaced with a precision Licor LI200X. This pyranometer measures
   incoming solar radiation with a silicon photovoltaic detector mounted
   in a cosine-corrected head. This pyranometer is calibrated against an
   Eppley Precision Spectral Pyranometer to accurately measure sun plus
   sky radiation to within 2% over a broad temperature range. This sensor
   weighs only one ounce and is less than one inch in diameter. This small
   size allows the sensor to be easily mounted on the balloon top-plate.


                      [Rain%20Gage%20300%20x%20225.jpg]

    Rain gage sensor (pressure transducer measuring water column height).

   3.3 Rain Gage

   It is very likely that rain bands in the hurricane will be encountered
   as the smart balloon travels toward the eye wall of a hurricane. To
   help understand the behavior of the balloon and to help in predicting
   the necessary altitude control actions that need to be initiated, a
   miniature precipitation gage is mounted to the top plate of the smart
   balloon.

   The miniature rain gage is built into the top plate of the balloon
   allowing the gage to measure up to 15 inches of precipitation before it
   is full. A small pressure transducer in the base of the rain gage
   converts the water column pressure to total rain. Because vertical
   balloon motion shows up as changes in the water column pressure the
   data is processed through a low pass filter to remove high frequency
   noise caused by turbulence and motion.


   3.4 Barometric Pressure, Temperature, and Relative Humidity

   The equivalent potential temperature of the inflow layer has been tied
   to the potential intensity of hurricanes and therefore represents a key
   quantity for the smart balloon to track. Pressure, temperature and
   relative humidity data are necessary to calculate equivalent potential
   temperature, which is a conserved quantity for moist adiabatic motions.


                    [Baro%20Pressure%20480%20x%20360.jpg]

                      Barometric pressure transmitter.

   A Vaisala model PTB101B pressure transmitter was selected for accuracy,
   small size and low power requirements. The pressure range of this
   sensor is 600 to 1060 millibars. Total accuracy is ±2 millibars, with a
   linearity of ±.45 millibars and a hysteresis and repeatability of ±.05
   millibars. This pressure sensor uses only 4 milliamps when active and
   can be turned off between measurements. Temperature dependence of the
   output is rated at ±.05 millibars per degree centigrade. Altitude
   accuracy is improved by processing the GPS altitude data and barometric
   pressure altitude data through a low pass filter to provide a
   correction to the real-time barometric pressure altitude.

                  Temperature and relative humidity probe.

   Temperature and humidity measurements will be improved by use of an
   aspirated temperature shield inside the transponder and a high quality
   Vaisala HMP45C temperature and relative humidity probe. The radiation
   shield is made of thin wall copper tubing and aluminum with an
   aspirator fan pulling 250,000 cubic centimeters per minute past the
   probe continuously. The air is isolated from other instruments inside
   the transponder to protect them from condensing moisture and possible
   sea salt.

   Temperature accuracy for the probe is within ±.4 degrees centigrade and
   a resolution and repeatability of ±.05 degrees centigrade.

   Relative humidity accuracy is within ±3% over the full range of 0 to
   100% relative himidity. Resolution and repeatability of the relative
   humidity are ±.05%. The long term stability of the relative humidity
   portion of this probe is better than ±1% per year.


   4. BALLOON ALTITUDE CONTROL

   The smart balloon is controlled by pumping air into (decreased the
   balloon altitude) or releasing air from (increased the balloon
   altitude) the pressurized air ballast portion of the balloon. Each
   liter of air stored in the ballast portion of the balloon weighs about
   1.2 grams per liter at sea level. Since the balloon volume is constant
   under pressure, the density of the balloon changes when ballast air is
   increased or decreased.


            [Transponder%20Interface%20Board%20400%20x%20300.jpg]

      The transponder interface is the control center of the hurricane
   balloon.  The micro controller mounted on the back side of this printed
    circuit board provides all measurement and control functions for the
    balloon.  The low power GPS receiver is also mounted on the back side
                           of this circuit board.

   Control of pumping and release valve action is determined by comparing
   the actual flying altitude to the desired altitude setting. The actual
   altitude is updated every second by the onboard GPS receiver. Prior to
   launch or even during flight the desired altitude range is controlled
   by the operator on the ground. The smart balloon micro controller
   maintains this data and manages control of the pump and release valve
   operations for total autonomous operation. The operator is able to
   override automatic altitude control with manual operation of the
   release valve or turning the pump on/off.


   4.1 New Dual Head Pump

   Pumping rate has been doubled by using a dual head pump. The new pump
   is capable of pumping 26.4 grams (22 liters) of air per minute at a
   balloon pressure of 1.5 psi. See table 3 for more complete information
   on the pumping rate.

   4.2 Improved Ballast Release Valve

   An electro-mechanical pinch valve was specifically designed by FRD to
   allow faster ballast release rate. The new pinch valve uses a small,
   low power gear head motor and pinch plate to make a very high flow rate
   (when open) valve. Advantages to this type of valve include:

     Low power operation and no power required once it is open or closed.

     Once the tube is pinched closed pressure from the tubing actually
     keep the pinch valve latched closed.

     Much larger diameter tubing can be used which allows for faster
     release of ballast air.

                       Globalstar satellite telephone.

   5. SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS

   With the very recent introduction of a small satellite telephone on the
   market, it is now feasible to use one of these for data communications
   on the smart balloon. A handheld Globalstar satellite telephone has
   been selected for this purpose. Some of the advantages of using the new
   satellite phones are:


     A data gathering aircraft is not required to relay data from the
     balloon to the ground over the period of tracking (12 to 24 hours).

     Data receiving equipment is required in only one location rather
     than on the ground and multiple aircraft.

     Tracking is simplified by keeping tracking and control in one
     location (preferably at the release site where balloon control will
     take place). Balloon data will be forwarded to other scientists at
     the experiment operations center and on participating aircraft via
     the Internet.

     The Satellite telephones are a several hundred dollars less
     expensive than the VHF radio/modem combination that were used during
     ACE-2.

     Even though talk time is expensive ($1 to $1.50 per minute),
     additional equipment and aircraft time make the alternative much
     more expensive and less flexible.

     A data rate of 9600 bits per second provide data at about 8 times
     the rate available previously over long distances (50 to 200 miles).
     This increased data bandwidth allows for one second update of
     position and meteorological data and still allows for retransmission
     of data that may be found in error.

     No modem is required. The satellite phone is digital and only an
     RS-232 adapter cable is required.


   6. SUMMARY

   A new generation of smart balloon is being constructed to serve as a
   data gathering platform in the environment of hurricanes. A number of
   recent technical advances make this possible, including the appearance
   of lightweight, affordable satellite telephones, improvements in
   balloon and transponder design, better instrument accuracy, and
   improved GPS position and altitude accuracy (Selected Availability has
   been turned off).
