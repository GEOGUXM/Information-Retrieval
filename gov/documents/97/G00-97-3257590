                              The Clarity Award

   The Pythagorean theorem contains 24 words, while the Ten Commandments
   consists of 179 words and the Gettysburg Adress is all of 286 words
   long. By contrast, U.S. government regulations on the sale of cabbage
   boasts 26,911 words and California regulations on catching trout and
   salmon consume 18,897 words.

   The Governor's Office for Innovation in Government has initiated
   California's "Clarity Award" program with the goal to simplify the
   language used in state government documents. The Clarity Award program
   involves reducing complexity and verbosity in documents, from pamphlets
   and loan applications to everyday forms and regulations. By simplifying
   the language, we will send a clear message about what the state is
   doing, what it requires, and what services it offers.

   The four categories of the Clarity Award are:
     * Public information
     * Forms
     * Regulations
     * Internal documents

   The Clarity Award is given on a regular basis to those departments and
   agencies that produce higher-quality, easy to comprehend documents that
   enhance service delivery to Californians. For more information,
   contact: Erin Larson, Project Manager, at (916) 445-1176, or e-mail:
   info@innovation.ca.gov.
