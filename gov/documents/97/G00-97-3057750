   Picture of the F-8, the Transonic Tunnel, and the Advanced Flexible
   Wing The Dynamics and Control Branch can trace its history back several
   decades during which a common research theme has been aircraft guidance
   and control. Several examples of specific work during that time follow.
   In the early 1970's branch members were responsible for developing
   digital control laws for the F-8 Fly-by-Wire airplane.

   During this time period, it became clear that there was an urgent need
   for a software package of efficient and reliable algorithms to provide
   solutions to time invariant continuous or discrete linear quadratic
   gaussian (LQG) problems. In response to this need, a software package
   called ORACLS (Optimal Regulator Algorithms for the Control of Linear
   Systems) was developed to incorporate the best numerical methods that
   the rapidly developing state of the art in LQG theory was providing for
   isolated cases. ORACLS systematized these algorithms so that they could
   be applied efficaciously in an entire control system design. The
   software was made generally available through COSMIC (Computer Software
   Management and Information Center) and at one point was the eleventh
   most often accessed program out of more that 2000 programs in the
   COSMIC inventory.

   In order to provide adequate models for model based control laws and to
   provide uncertainty bounds on theoretical or wind tunnel derived
   aerodynamic models, an extensive effort was undertaken in the field of
   system identification applied to aircraft flight data in the 1980's.
   System identification algorithms were developed and software written to
   extract aerodynamic model structure and associated parameters
   (stability and control derivatives) in both linear and nonlinear flight
   regions. These software included stepwise regression, maximum
   likelihood, and Kalman filtering techniques and were validated on a
   wide variety of line and research aircraft including general aviation,
   high performance fighters, transports, unpowered drop-models, and the
   Shuttle Orbiter.

   Also during that decade, working with engineers from Rockwell
   International Corporation, branch members designed control laws for the
   Active Flexible Wing (AFW). This concept, pioneered and advanced by
   Rockwell, exploited rather than avoided wing flexibility to provide
   weight savings and improved aerodynamics for advanced fighter
   configurations. The test bed for the AFW Program, an
   aeroelastically-scaled wind tunnel model of an advanced fighter
   configuration was extensively tested in Langley's Transonic Dynamics
   Tunnel.

   In the 1990's work began on anticipating the problems that would be
   encountered by a National Aerospace Plane (NASP) type vehicle as it
   flew through an uncertain atmosphere. To investigate the effects that
   atmospheric uncertainties and inhomogeneities might have on such
   vehicles, branch members developed the NASP Integrated Atmospheric
   Model (NIAM). NIAM integrated features from the Global Reference
   Atmospheric Model (GRAM-90), a random turbulence model developed by
   McDonnell Douglas (PERT), and deterministic wind and gust models based
   on the NASP Natural Environment Requirements Document.

   The areas of expertise developed by people in the organization include
   classical and modern control theory; control law design for aircraft
   from conception through flight test and evaluation; batch, real time,
   and piloted simulation, flight test design and analysis of resulting
   data ; system identification and parameter estimation; aircraft
   mathematical modeling; and atmosphere modeling.

   These areas of expertise have been exercised with support of NASA
   research facilities including computers, wind tunnels, and aircraft. A
   number of memoranda of agreement (MOA) have been executed with industry
   for the exchange of data and expertise to the mutual benefit of the
   branch and the industry. Through these MOA's the branch expanded its
   available data sources to current and developing aircraft. It has also
   brought current problems in industry closer to the organization.
