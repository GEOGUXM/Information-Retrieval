     Welcome to the NASA Goddard DAAC Earth System Science Educational
     Home Page. We are one of the Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) data
     centers. The data are used to study changes in Earth's atmosphere,
     lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. We are developing
     educational materials for the high school and college level that may
     be used for personal and classroom enhancement of scientific
     knowledge.

    Highlights of educational resources for high school and college:

     Oceanography from the Space Shuttle
     space shuttle icon This is a photographic survey of oceanic
     phenomenon visible to the naked eye acquired by NASA astronauts.
     Some of the things you will observe sets of internal waves as they
     propagate through the Strait of Gibraltar, complex linking of spiral
     eddies, ship wakes covering hundreds of miles, pollution at sea, and
     coastal phenomena.

     Geomorphology from Space: A Global overview of Regional Landforms
     earth view icon This is a study of landforms and landscapes,
     including the description, classification, origin, development, and
     history of planetary surfaces. The core of the book is a gallery of
     space imagery consisting of 237 plates, each treating some
     geographic region where a particular landform theme is exemplified.
     Commentary, photographs, locator maps, and sometimes a geologic map
     accompany each plate.
