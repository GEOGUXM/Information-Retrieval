   Description: high resolution images:
   true color
   cirrus detection channel

   The Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) cloud
   detection capability is so sensitive that it can detect clouds that
   would be indistinguishable to the human eye. This pair of images
   highlights MODIS ability to detect what scientists call sub-visible
   cirrus. The image on top shows the scene using data collected in the
   visible part of the electromagnetic spectrumthe part our eyes can see.
   Clouds are apparent in the center and lower right of the image, while
   the rest of the image appears to be relatively clear. However, data
   collected at 1.38µm (lower image) show that a thick layer of previously
   undetected cirrus clouds obscures the entire scene. These kinds of
   cirrus are called sub-visible because they cant be detected using
   only visible light. MODIS 1.38µm channel detects electromagnetic
   radiation in the infrared region of the spectrum. These images were
   made from data collected on April 4, 2000.
