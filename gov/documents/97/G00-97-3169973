The VA Community Based Outpatient Clinics

   As part of our primary care service, you may receive treatment at one
   of our Community Based Outpatient Clinics. The Dayton VA Medical Center
   currently offers three locations, Springfield, Middletown and Lima. You
   may continue to use the Dayton VA Medical Center for healthcare
   services, however veterans from Clark, Champaign, and Greene counties
   are encouraged to use the Springfield clinic for primary care; veterans
   from Warren and Butler Counties are encouraged to visit the Middletown
   clinic, and veterans from Allen, Auglaize, Defiance, Hancock, Hardin,
   Logan, Mercer, Paulding, Putnam, Shelby, Van Wert, & Wyandot counties
   may use the Lima clinic.
