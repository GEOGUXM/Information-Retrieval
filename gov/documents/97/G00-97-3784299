  Project Goals

   Abramowitz and Stegun's Handbook of Mathematical Functions is being
   thoroughly reviewed with regard to the needs of today. The new DLMF
   (Digital Library of Mathematical Functions) will be an electronic
   publication on the World Wide Web. It will make full use of advanced
   communications and computational resources to present not only static
   data but also, we hope, made-to-order dynamic information such as
   graphs, tables of numerical values, and symbolic transformations. The
   authoritative status of the existing Handbook, and its orientation
   toward applications in science, statistics, engineering and
   computation, will be preserved. An applications component will be
   included for electromagnetism and quantum physics to provide access to
   mathematical information in these fields, to coordinate and standardize
   definitions and notation, and to serve as a prototype applications
   component for other fields.

   Thus the utilitarian value of the Handbook will be extended far beyond
   its original scope and the traditional limitations of printed media.
   The term digital library has gained acceptance for this kind of
   information resource, and our choice of project title reflects our hope
   that the NIST DLMF will be a vehicle for revolutionizing the way
   applicable mathematics in general is practiced and delivered.
