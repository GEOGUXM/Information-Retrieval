   NHTSA Biomechanics Test Database
   The NHTSA Biomechanics Test Database is a repository of experimental
   data used by NHTSA for developing Anthropomophic Test Devices and
   associated Injury Criteria. The data is disseminated via this website
   for use by academia, the automotive industry, and the public to improve
   the safety of automobiles and reduce death and injuries on our nations
   highway. Because of the nature of the testing, the applicability of the
   data extends far beyond auto safety, and may be useful for those in the
   sports medicine, space travel, aircraft, military or any activity where
   the human body is exposed impact.
