   Although today's sophisticated program delivery systems are much more
   dramatic, it is important to remember that Correspondence Study is
   equally important in the FAA's delivery of training.

   The FAA Academy's Correspondence Study Program offers technical,
   management, and business skills training allowing individuals to work
   at their own pace outside the classroom. There are about 100 courses to
   choose from.

   For more information, contact the Correspondence Study Office by phone
   (405) 954-0227, fax (405) 954-0231 or email.
