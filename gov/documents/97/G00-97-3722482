   Program Description

   The Federal Aviation Administration oversees the designation of
   Aviation Medical Examiners (AMEs) who serve the needs of airmen across
   the nation. AMEs are qualified medical doctors who have applied to the
   FAA for designation to perform aviation flight physicals on airmen.

   To be designated as an Alaskan AME, physicians must meet several
   professional and logistical requirements mandated by the FAA and must
   attend a training seminar in Oklahoma City. AMEs must also comply with
   requirements for FAA training every 3 years. The AME is designated by
   the Regional Flight Surgeon after all requirements have been met.

   An AME may be designated in a particular area or location after we have
   established the need for an AME in that area. The AME may perform
   second and third class aviation flight physicals for pilots/student
   pilots. Upon examination, the AME is required to complete FAA Form
   8500-8, Application for Airman Medical Certification.

   A physician may apply for Senior AME designation, to perform first
   class medical examinations for air transport pilots, after serving as
   an AME for 3 years. A physician with prior flight surgeon training may
   apply at initial designation for Senior AME status.

   AMEs may also apply for and be designated to perform Air Traffic
   Controller Exams in those areas with an established need.
