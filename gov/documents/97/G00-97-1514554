             Historical Volcanic Eruptions in the United States

   Alaska

   Alaska hosts within its borders over 80 major volcanic centers that
   have erupted during the past 10,000 years. At least 29 of these
   volcanic centers had historical eruptions and 12 additional volcanic
   centers may have had historical eruptions. Historical in Alaska
   generally means the period since 1760 when explorers, travelers, and
   inhabitants kept written records. These 41 volcanic centers have been
   the source for more than 256 historical eruptions reported from Alaska
   volcanoes.

   Washington

       Mount Baker

          1840-1870: Historical literature refers to several episodes of
          small tephra-producing events in the mid 1800s, and increased
          fumarolic activity began in Sherman Crater near the summit in
          1975 and remains elevated today.

       Glacier Peak

          17th - 18th centuries: Between about 200 and 300 years ago,
          small eruptions deposited pumice and ash east of the volcano,
          and may have been observed by Native Americans.

       Mount Rainier

          1894 & early 1800s: Several eyewitness accounts describe minor
          releases of steam and ash-laden steam during November and
          December 1894. The most recent eruption that formed a thin and
          discontinuous tephra layer, however, occurred during the first
          half of the 19th century.

       Mount St. Helens

          1980-1986: Large explosive eruption on May 18, 1980, followed by
          21 smaller eruptive episodes. The last 17 episodes built a lava
          dome in the volcano's crater.

            including illustrations
          + Fact sheet: Mount St. Helens Â– From the 1980 Eruption to 2000

          1800-1857: Large explosive eruption in 1800 was followed by
          extrusions of lava that formed a lava flow on the volcano's
          northwest flank (Floating Island lava flow) and a lava dome on
          the north flank (Goat Rocks lava dome).

          Late 1700s: Layers of volcanic rocks record a variety of
          activity related to the growth of a lava dome at the volcano's
          summit, including pyroclastic flows, lahars, and tephra fall.

   Oregon

       Mount Hood

          1856-1865 & late 1700s: According to eyewitnesses, small
          explosive eruptions occurred from the summit area between 1856
          and 1865. In the latter half of the 18th century, however, a
          lava dome was erupted, which was accompanied by pyroclastic
          flows, lahars, and tephra fall.

   California

       Mount Shasta

          1786: An eruption cloud was observed above the volcano from a
          ship passing by north coast California, and the activity
          included pyroclastic flows.

       Lassen Peak

          1914-1917: A series of small explosions that began on May 30,
          1914, was followed 12 months later by extrusion of lava from the
          summit and a destructive pyroclastic flow and lahars on May 21,
          1915. Minor activity continued through middle of 1917. See fact
          sheet, Eruptions of Lassen Peak, 1914-1917 (PDF).


   Hawai`i

       Kilauea Volcano, Hawai`i

          1790-present, eruption summary table: First written record of
          eruption at Kilauea was in 1823; strong explosive activity
          occurred in 1790.

       Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawai`i

          1832-present, eruption summary table: First written record of
          eruption at Mauna Loa was in 1832 (eyewitness was on Maui, 190
          km away).

       Hualalai Volcano, Hawai`i

          late 1700s - 1801: Six different vents erupted lava between the
          late 1700s and 1801, two of which generated lava flows that
          poured into the sea on the west coast of Hawai`i.

       East Mau`i Volcano (Haleakala), Mau`i

          1790: Two lava flows erupted on the southwest flank and reached
          the sea.
