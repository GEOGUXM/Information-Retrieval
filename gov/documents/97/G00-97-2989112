   THE 1960's

          The civil rights movement picked up momentum during the 1960's,
          The movement started in the 1950's to protest segregation. In
          1896, the Supreme Court had ruled that there should be "Separate
          but equal" facilities for black and white Americans. The ruling
          dictated that everything from maternity wards to morgues be
          segregated. Though separate, segregated facilities, particularly
          schools, were seldom, if ever, equal. White schools were usually
          new and well-maintained while black schools were single room
          shacks. In 1951, the Reverend Oliver Brown tried to enroll his
          daughter, Linda, in all-white Sumner Elementary School in
          Topeka, Kansas. Denied, Brown sued the Board of Education, and
          the case was argued before the Supreme Court in 1953. In an
          unanimous decision, the Court ruled, "Separate educational
          facilities are inherently unequal," Brown v. the Board of
          Education ended segregation in public schools, but school
          systems in both the North and South fought the decision.

          The civil rights movement began in earnest after 43-year-old
          seamstress Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her
          seat to a white person on a Montgomery, Alabama bus. The black
          community of Montgomery selected the minister of her church,
          Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., to lead the protest against
          her arrest. King put his philosophy of non-violent civil
          disobedience into action by organizing a boycott of Montgomery's
          buses. For more than a year no black person rode a Montgomery
          bus, In November 1956, the Supreme Court ordered Montgomery to
          desegregate its buses. For the next ten years, peaceful protests
          led the civil rights movement slowly along until it boiled over
          in the mid- I 960's

          In 1963, King led 250,000 people in a peaceful march on
          Washington, D.C, His televised ''I have a dream" speech
          confronted white America with the justice of the civil rights
          movement. He said, "I have a dream that one day this nation will
          rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold
          these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created
          equal."' In June 1964, the Civil Rights Act was passed, and in
          October, King won the Nobel Peace Prize.

          By 1965, however, the tenor of the movement changed; it's
          nonviolence was being increasingly met with violence and death.
          President Kennedy and Mississippi NAACP (National Association
          for the Advancement of Colored People) leader Medgar Evars had
          both been killed in 1963. In 1964, a Birmingham, Alabama church
          was bombed, killing four little girls, and three civil rights
          workers were slain in Mississippi. Malcolm X, one-time spokesman
          for the Nation of Islam and leader of the Organization for
          Afro-American Unity, was murdered in early 1965. On August 1],
          1965, a predominately black section of Los Angeles called Watts
          erupted in six days of riots. A white policeman had arrested a
          black motorist for drunk driving, and the gathering crowd's
          frustration erupted into violence. The summer of 1965 was the
          first of several summers that left cities smoldering with
          unrest, the worst rioting happening in Newark and Detroit in
          1967. Presidential commissions studying the riots determined the
          cause was economic. Martin Luther King agreed, "I worked to get
          these people the right to eat hamburgers, and now I've got to do
          something to help them get the money to buy them." However, he
          was killed in March 1968, setting off another wave of riots.



          June 1960

          Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev pledged support for "wars of
          national liberation" in an address to the United Nations in New
          York, At one point during the speech, Khrushchev took off his
          shoe and banged it on the table. (One of his biographers
          speculated that this was designed to improve his image at home.)
          Khrushchev came to New York in the middle of the 1960
          Presidential election campaign. His U.N address awakened Western
          fears that he planned to aid Communist revolutionary movements
          around the world. After his U.N. speech, Fidel Castro, leader of
          the recent revolution in Cuba, visited Khrushchev in his hotel
          room.

          January 1961

          The 1960 presidential election had taken place during a time of
          increasing hostility between the United States and the Soviet
          Union. Tensions were rising in Berlin, and the Soviets had shot
          down an American U-2 reconnaissance plane over Soviet territory.
          Senator John Kennedy campaigned as a tough anti-Communist cold
          warrior. In a televised debate between Vice President Richard
          Nixon and Senator Kennedy, Kennedy charged that the "missile
          gap" had given the Soviets military superiority and he was
          determined to make the United States "number one" again. Kennedy
          won the election by a slim margin.

          In his inauguration speech, President Kennedy said, "Let every
          nation know whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay
          any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any
          friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of
          liberty." He cautioned the Soviets against "aggression or
          subversion anywhere in the Americas." He also said, "We dare not
          tempt them with weakness, For only when our arms are sufficient
          beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never
          be employed."



          April 1961

          On April 12, 196 1, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was the first
          human in space. His ship, Vostok 1, made one orbit of the Earth,
          lasting 89.1 minutes. The entire trip from blastoff to landing
          lasted one hour and 48 minutes,



          April 1961

          The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)-backed invasion of Cuba at
          the Bay of Pigs failed. Shortly after taking office, President
          Kennedy approved the CIA's plan, inherited from the Eisenhower
          administration, to invade Cuba and oust Fidel Castro's Communist
          government, The United States launched the invasion three months
          into Kennedy's administration. Over 1,400 Cuban exiles, trained
          and equipped by the CIA, landed on Cuba's coast without air
          cover, The success of the invasion depended on a large uprising
          against Fidel Castro. However, the CIA had underestimated
          Castro's military strength and his popular support. All of the
          exiles were captured or killed by the Cuban armed forces within
          three days.



          August 1961

          The Berlin Wall was erected between West and East Berlin, During
          the summer of 1961, a substantial number of East Germans had
          fled to the West through East Berlin. In August, the Soviet
          Union closed the Brandenburg Gate and sealed off the border
          between the eastern and western sectors of Berlin to stop the
          flow of refugees.

          Partly because of the tense Berlin situation, President Kennedy
          asked Congress for a major increase in the U.S. defense budget,
          Kennedy requested more intercontinental ballistic missiles, more
          nuclear submarines, and more funds for civil defense.



          September 1961

          As part of a campaign to reduce the United States' vulnerability
          to nuclear attack, President Kennedy advised Americans to build
          fallout shelters. President Kennedy's letter in the September
          issue of Life magazine set off a wave of "shelter mania" which
          lasted for about a year.

          At this time, the Soviet Union also unexpectedly exploded the
          largest nuclear device in history, equal to 57 million tons of
          TNT. The Soviet Union had voluntarily stopped testing nuclear
          devices three years before, and Khrushchev had assured President
          Kennedy in June 1961 that the Soviet Union wouldn't test nuclear
          devices if the United States didn't.

          October 1962

          An American U-2 reconnaissance plane discovered Soviet missiles
          in Cuba on October 14, 1962, On October 16, considered Day I of
          the Cuban Missile Crisis, the President's National Security
          Advisor showed him the photographs taken by the U-2. They showed
          components of Soviet medium-ranged missiles that once assembled
          could reach at least 50% of the United States. President Kennedy
          chose to blockade Cuba, both by air and sea, to prevent any more
          Soviet shipments of weapons from reaching Cuba,

          On Day 7 of the 13 day crisis, President Kennedy showed the
          photographs to the American people and warned the Soviets that
          if the Cubans launched their missiles, the United States would
          launch a "full retaliatory response against the U.S.S.R."
          Kennedy's speech led to mass protest demonstrations in London,
          Cairo, Tokyo, and Rio De Janeiro and to panic buying in U.S.
          supermarkets. The Soviet Union responded 13 hours later that the
          United States could lose millions of lives because of its
          aggressive policy. Soviet Premier Khrushchev ordered submarines
          to rendezvous with Soviet ships nearing the blockade.

          On Day 10, the United States confronted the Soviet Union in the
          United Nations, The next day, a KGB (Soviet secret service)
          chief contacted the ABC Network's State Department correspondent
          to hint that the Soviet Union might remove its missiles if the
          United States promised not to invade Cuba. Shortly thereafter,
          President Kennedy received a long teletype from Premier
          Khrushchev outlining the same deal. A second teletype insisted
          on the United States also removing its missiles from Turkey,
          Attorney General Robert Kennedy met with the Soviet ambassador
          to work out a deal. The Soviets agreed to remove their missiles
          from Cuba, and the United States promised not to invade Cuba.
          The United States also informed the Soviet Union that it had
          already decided to remove its now-obsolete missiles from Turkey
          On October 28, Radio Moscow announced that the Soviet Union
          would remove its missiles from Cuba, ending the Cuban Missile
          Crisis.

          The Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world to the brink of
          nuclear war, but it also led to a hot line between Moscow and
          Washington (see June 1963) and the Limited Test Ban Treaty (see
          August 1963).

          June 1963

          The United States and the Soviet Union set up a hot line
          (teletype) between the White House and the Kremlin. The Cuban
          Missile Crisis showed both the United States and the Soviet
          Union the need for better communication. The two superpowers
          signed an agreement on June 20, 1963 to set up the hot line, and
          it was installed a few weeks later.



          August 1963

          On August 5, 1963, the United States and the Soviet Union signed
          the Limited Test Ban Treaty, prohibiting underwater,
          atmospheric, and outer space nuclear tests. The treaty does not
          ban underground nuclear tests, which limit the radiation
          released into the environment. More than 100 countries have
          ratified the treaty since 1963. Satellites in high orbits
          monitor the treaty by watching for the characteristic flash of a
          nuclear explosion.

          March 1965

          The French colonized Vietnam in 1867, and the Vietnamese
          resisted them from that point on, In 1930-3 1, the French
          suppressed a peasant uprising, killing 10,000 and deporting
          50,000 Vietnamese. During World War 11, the Japanese took over
          Vietnam but left French collaborators in charge. Vietnamese
          nationalists, including the communists led by Ho Chi Minh, went
          underground and formed a coalition called the Viet Minh. The
          Viet Minh liberated northern provinces of Vietnam from the
          Japanese at the end of World War 11, After the war, the United
          States set up the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) to
          protect South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos from the Viet Minh.

          Throughout the 1950's, the United States aided the non-communist
          government of South Vietnam while China and the Soviet Union
          aided North Vietnam. The government of South Vietnam jailed
          20,000-30,000 suspected communists. Taking advantage of the
          antigovernment sentiment in South Vietnam, the Viet Minh in
          North Vietnam organized the National Liberation Front in the
          south in 1960. The South Vietnamese government dubbed them the
          Viet Cong, or Vietnamese communists

          The United States saw the unrest in South Vietnam as communist
          aggression from Chinese and Soviet-backed North Vietnam.
          (Ironically, U.S. intelligence revealed later that 80-90% of the
          Viet Cong were from South Vietnam.) In 1956, then-Senator
          Kennedy had called South Vietnam "the cornerstone of the Free
          World in Southeast Asia, the keystone in the arch, the finger in
          the dike." Kennedy agreed with President Eisenhower's "domino
          theory," He believed that if one country in Southeast Asia fell
          to communism, the others would topple-like a line of dominoes,
          each falling and knocking the next over. As president, Kennedy
          said, "We have a very simple policy in Vietnam. We want the war
          to be won, the communists to be contained, and the Americans to
          go home." The United States had already sent Green Berets and
          other military "advisors" to Vietnam,

          On August 4, 1964, two U,S. destroyers reportedly tangled with
          North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin, On August
          7, Congress passed almost unanimously the Tonkin Gulf
          Resolution, which authorized the President to "take all
          necessary measures to repel any armed attack against forces of
          the United States and to prevent further aggression." The
          open-ended language of the resolution gave President Lyndon
          Johnson considerable war-making power. (President Johnson
          himself said the resolution "was like Grandma's nightshirt-it
          covered everything." Congress repealed the resolution in 1970.)
          In December 1964, President Johnson approved bombing raids
          against North Vietnam, In March 1965, the first U.S. combat
          troops were sent to Vietnam. By the end of 1965, 184,314
          American troops were in Vietnam. Within a year, that number grew
          to 385,000,

          1966-67

          The large number of utility orders for nuclear power reactors
          made nuclear power a commercial reality in the United States,
          Before 1966, electric utilities had ordered less than ten
          reactors total. In 1966-67, that number quadrupled. After
          declining slightly in 1969, nuclear power reactor orders peaked
          in 1972-73.



          July 1968

          The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)-calling for halting
          the international spread of nuclear weapons capabilities-was
          signed. Non-nuclear nations-those that had not developed nuclear
          weapons at the time they signed the NPT-pledged never to make or
          acquire nuclear weapons. Nuclear nations pledged not to assist
          other countries in making or acquiring nuclear weapons and to
          curb the growth of their own arsenals. By 1970, more than 50
          countries had ratified the NPT. By 1986, more than 130 countries
          had ratified it.

          American astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first human on the
          moon. Apollo 11 astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin touched down on
          the moon near the Sea of Tranquillity on July 20,1969. At 10:56
          pm Eastern Daylight Time, Armstrong stepped out of the lunar
          lander Eagle and said, "That's one small step for man, one giant
          leap for mankind."
