               EASTIN SUPPORTS NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK
                                IN CALIFORNIA

          SACRAMENTO-State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine
     Eastin issued the following statement in recognition of February
     4-8, 2002 as National School Counseling Week:

          "I urge Californians to take time during this week to
     acknowledge school counselors for the tremendous impact they can
     have in helping students achieve academic success and plan for a
     career. School counselors work as an integral part of the school
     team of teachers, parents, and administrators in enabling all
     students to achieve success in school, and to become responsible and
     productive members of society.
          "National School Counseling Week, February 4-8, 2002, provides
     recognition for school counselors who implement comprehensive school
     counseling programs, a vital part of the educational process for all
     students as they meet the challenges of the 21st century. In
     addressing such areas as student achievement, crisis response, and
     career planning, school counselors have played a critical role in
     early intervention and prevention through counseling and guidance
     programs that provide direct services to students and their
     families.
          "Schools across California and the nation celebrate National
     School Counseling Week each year with a variety of activities,
     focusing on student achievement, safe schools, multiculturalism,
     human rights, parent and family involvement, child advocacy,
     community collaborations and partnerships, and professional renewal.
     As all educators focus their efforts on improved academic
     achievement of students, it is important that we recognize school
     counselors for their continuing efforts in reducing barriers to
     learning and in providing the support necessary for all students to
     achieve at the highest level possible.
          "It's time that every student in California receives the
     academic, career, and personal/social benefits of an effective
     school counseling program. California schools, however, still suffer
     from the worst student-to-counselor ratio in the nation. The
     2000-2001 student-to-counselor ratio in California is 945-to-1,
     significantly higher than the national average of 490-to-1. I
     encourage the media to join with local communities in publicizing
     the important role that school counselors play in California's
     schools, and the need for all students to have access to the
     important programs and services that counselors provide."
