   The Audit Program


   Background

   Chapter 10 of the Political Reform Act provides the guidelines for an
   ongoing program of mandatory audits. The program encompasses campaign
   statements filed by all candidates for elective office, from statewide
   offices to special local jurisdictions, as well as the reports filed by
   lobbying firms and lobbyist employers. It also includes statements
   filed by state ballot measure committees and state general purpose
   committees. The majority of the audits are conducted by a special unit
   of the Franchise Tax Board. Statements filed by candidates for state
   controller and state Board of Equalization, however, are audited by the
   Fair Political Practices Commission.

   The Selection Process

   All candidates for statewide office, supreme ourt, court of appeal, and
   Board of Equalization are subject to audit if they have raised or spent
   $25,000 or more. Additionally, all state ballot measure committees
   which have spent more than $10,000 and all candidates for the
   legislature in a special election who have raised or spent $15,000 or
   more are subject to audit. The FPPC determines the remainder of the
   audit workload in a series of random drawings conducted shortly after
   each two-year election cycle.

     Statewide candidates who have raised or spent less than $25,000: 10%
     of these candidates are selected for audit.

     Lobbying firms and lobbyist employers: 25 % of the lobbying firms
     and 25% of the lobbyist employers are selected for audit.

     Legislative districts and contested superior court offices: 25 % of
     the senate districts, assembly districts, and contested superior
     court offices are selected. Candidates who raised or spent $15,000
     or more in the selected races are subject to audit.

     General purpose committees that have raised or spent more than
     $10,000: Committees which have had no prior audit, or which have not
     previously been determined to be in compliance, are all subject to
     audit. Of those committees the FPPC had determined in a prior audit
     to be in compliance with the provisions of the Act, 25 % are
     selected.

     Local jurisdictions: A group of twenty local jurisdictions, includng
     eight counties, eight cities, two school districts and two special
     districts, is selected. If the Franchise Tax Board has additional
     audit hours available after completion of this workload, a second
     group of twenty jurisdictions is provided.

   Candidates for the Board of Administration of the Public Employees'
   Retirement System are subject to audit if they have received
   contributions of $1,000 or more during an election year. Additionally,
   25% of the candidates who have received contributions of less than
   $1,000 will be selected for audit in a random drawing.
