                       ARM Cloud and Radiation Testbed Sites


                Southern Great Plains
   Tropical Western Pacific | North Slope of Alaska
               ARM sites on world map

      The ARM Program establishes and operates field research sites, called
      Cloud and Radiation Testbeds (CARTs), to study the effects of clouds on
      global climate change. Three primary locations -- Southern Great
      Plains, Tropical Western Pacific, and North Slope of Alaska -- were
      identified as representing the range of climate conditions that should
      be studied. Each CART site has been heavily instrumented to gather
      massive amounts of climate data. Using these data, scientists hope to
      better understand the effects and interactions of sunlight, radiant
      energy, and clouds on temperatures, weather, and climate.
