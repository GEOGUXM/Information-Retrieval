   NOAA Central Library

The Interlibrary Loan Service

   The Interlibrary Loan (ILL) service allows NOAA Employees and
   Contractors to obtain materials not available in the NOAA Central
   Library. All materials obtained through Interlibrary Loan must be used
   solely by the requestor for research purposes only. To obtain items for
   personal use, please use your local public library. The requesting
   patron is responsible for all copyrights associated with the material
   under Title 17, U.S. Code.

   WHO MAY USE INTERLIBRARY LOAN?

   Interlibrary Loan is available to authorized NOAA employee and
   contractors simply by completing an ILL Request Form.  The requesting
   patron should be entered into the Central Library's system. Please
   contact the Reference Desk (713-2600 x124) to be registered as a
   library user and to obtain a User ID to complete the ILL form.

   The general public should use the Interlibrary Loan services at their
   local public, university, or corporate libraries to request for
   circulating items held at the NOAA Central Library. Borrowing libraries
   should make ILL requests to the NOAA Central Library through OCLC (OCLC
   symbol: OLA) or on ALA ILL request forms which can be faxed or emailed.

   PROCESSING A REQUEST

   The ILL Desk usually processes a request within one business day of
   submission. To expedite the ordering process, please provide citations
   that are accurate and complete. Please use the bibliographic databases
   available through the Central Library or consult the Reference Desk
   (713-2600 x124, reference@nodc.noaa.gov) for help. Requests for
   materials held at the Central Library are not processed by the ILL
   Desk. NOAA Employees and Contractors not located in Silver Spring, MD
   should contact the Reference Desk to borrow materials from the Central
   Library or should use their local NOAA Library.

   LOAN PERIOD

   The loan period of a borrowed item may range from two to four weeks and
   is determined by the lending library. It is important to return an ILL
   material when it is due or recalled to avoid fines and so that the
   Central Library can maintain borrowing privileges with that library. A
   renewal request can be made before the due date, but renewals are not
   always granted. An ILL material can be recalled by the lending library
   at any time.

   The requesting patron will be held responsible for the ILL item
   throughout the duration of the loan. The patron is expected to treat
   the material properly and to respond promptly to any notifications sent
   by the Central Library regarding the loan. Tardiness in returning
   items, losing books and poor handling of materials will jeopardize the
   Central Library's ability to borrow from other libraries. A patron's
   ILL privileges may be limited or suspended for poor ILL borrowing
   practices.

   HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?

   The length of time needed for a material to arrive depends on the type
   of material being requested, its availability, location of the
   supplying library and the delivery method used. Please, allow at least
   five working days for a photocopy and 7-10 working days for a book to
   arrive. Rush requests are possible for emergency cases only. When the
   material arrives, it is held at the Reference Desk and the patron is
   notified by email.

   (Please Note: The ILL and Renewal requests forms are restricted to NOAA
   Staff only.)
