   Mission Statement What is Spectrum Engineering?    Why is Spectrum

   Office of Spectrum Policy & Management represents the United States
   (U.S.) in meeting of the ITU and ICAO which require frequency spectrum
   engineering expertise and deal with civil aviation interests. These
   meetings address various issues, but all develop policy, technical
   procedures, and criteria concerning the use, sharing, management, or
   allocation of the radio frequency. Office of Spectrum Policy &
   Management provides the U.S. member to the ICAO's FMSG which meets once
   or twice a year to assist ICAO in formulating ICAO positions on various
   frequency management related issues. Office of Spectrum Policy &
   Management represents the FAA and TSC in IRAC, which meets twice a
   month under the auspices of NTIA, whose basic functions are to develop
   policies, programs, and procedures, and technical criteria pertaining
   to the allocation, management, and use of the radio frequency spectrum.
   The definition and establishment of frequency coordination procedures
   with Canada and Mexico are important aspects of the project. Office of
   Spectrum Policy & Management is active in a number of IRAC ad hoc
   groups addressing a wide variety of spectrum management issues such as
   preparation for World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRC), improved
   utilization of Government frequency resources, and providing spectrum
   resources for new system developments and services supporting current
   and future civil aviation needs.
