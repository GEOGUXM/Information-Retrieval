                        United States District Court
                             District of Hawaii

               NEW DOCUMENT RECEPTACLE FOR AFTER-HOURS FILING*

   On April 14th at 4:30p.m., the close of the business day, the Clerk's
   Office will place a clear Plexiglas document receptacle with a
   date/time stamper at the first floor entrance to the U.S. Courthouse.
   Effective April 15, 2000 the Federal Protective Service will no longer
   accept after-hours filing.
   Documents must be date/time stamped to reflect the exact time they were
   placed in the receptacle.
   Persons using this after-hours filing service should also be aware of
   the following:
     * The Plexiglas document receptacle created for after-hours filing is
       equipped with an automated date/time stamper above the receptacle
       opening. To activate the date/time stamper, insert the back side of
       the first page of the original document into the stamper. You will
       hear the stamper imprint your document with the correct date and
       time.
     * Once your document is date/time stamped, place it into the
       receptacle. Documents will be collected from the receptacle each
       day. Only documents that have been stamped and placed in the
       receptacle at the time of stamping will be accepted for filing.
     * The receptacle opening is approximately 2 3/4" by 10". If your
       document is too large to fit, divide it into parts that will fit.
       Each part should be marked with the title of the document, the case
       number and the part number, e.g. "Part 1 of 4 parts", etc.
     * A security video camera will record all transactions at the
       document receptacle.

           IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR SUGGESTIONS, CALL 541-1300

   * "After-hours" includes weekends and holidays.
