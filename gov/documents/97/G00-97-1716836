              Seatbelt / Child Safety Seat Checkpoint a Success


   Belmont, CA --

   The Belmont Police Department, with assistance from the San Carlos,
   Redwood City & Millbrae Police, held a seatbelt and child safety seat
   checkpoint in the 1400 block of Alameda, on Wednesday, November 28,
   2001 from 10:00AM to 2:00 PM.

   "The checkpoint is an educational tool to remind the public that both
   adults and children need to ‘Buckle Up’ - especially with the heavily
   traveled holiday season upon us," said Chief Greg Janke.

   Officers with special training on the proper installation of child
   safety seats, conducted inspections of child safety seats and provided
   information to parents.

   In all, 1300 drivers were contacted and only 20 of those were not
   wearing seatbelts. 41 parents had their child safety seats inspected,
   with 37 of those being used incorrectly. However, due to the
   educational nature of the checkpoint, no citations were issued.

   Several other parents made appointments for child safety seat
   inspections, to be conducted at a later date. Parents wishing to have
   their child safety seat inspected should contact their local Police or
   Sheriff's Department to see about scheduling an appointment for an
   inspection.
