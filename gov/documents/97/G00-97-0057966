     EPA is launching a new public awareness campaign, called CHANGE, to
     highlight how we can protect our environment for future generations by
     changing to more energy-efficient practices today. Each of us has a
     responsibility to protect the environment. Changing to ENERGY STAR is
     one easy way we can all do our part.
     In your home
     We can change to ENERGY STAR in our homes by choosing any of the more
     than 25 home products that have earned the government-backed ENERGY
     STAR label, by improving our homes as recommended by the Home Energy
     Yardstick and Home Energy Advisor, or by asking for ENERGY STAR if
     buying a new home. For an overview of how your can change to ENERGY
     STAR please order a brochure on the ENERGY STAR Change campaign or call
     1-888-STAR-YES for more information.
     At work
     The most energy-efficient businesses in America use about 30 percent
     less energy than their competitors. Organizations can change to ENERGY
     STAR, help protect the environment, and gain a competitive advantage.
