                  NIEHS Press Release #01-22, Oct. 3, 2001:
     Drop of 30 Percent in use of Animals in Some Tests Could Be Quickly
                  Achieved Through Use of Cells, U.S. Says

   Federal regulatory agencies require toxicity testing to determine the
   safety or hazard of various chemicals and products prior to human
   exposure. This information is used to properly classify and label
   products according to their potential hazard.
   Studies suggest that in vitro cytotoxicity methods may be useful in
   predicting starting doses for in vivo studies, potentially reducing the
   number of animals used for such determinations. Other studies have
   indicated an association between in vitro cytotoxicity and human lethal
   blood concentrations.
   However, these in vitro methods have not been evaluated in validation
   studies to determine their usefulness, limitations and compliance with
   regulatory testing requirements. Additionally, other in vitro methods
   are needed to establish accurate dose-response relationships before
   such methods could substantially reduce or replace animal use for acute
   toxicity determinations.
   A scientific workshop, In Vitro Methods for Assessing Acute Systemic
   Toxicity, was held October 17-20, 2000 at the Hyatt Regency Crystal
   City Hotel in Arlington, VA.
   Workshop Goal: to assess the current status of in vitro test methods
   for evaluating the acute systemic toxicity potential of chemicals. The
   status of available in vitro methods was examined and recommendations
   for validation efforts necessary to characterize the usefulness and
   limitations of existing methods were compiled. Recommendations for
   future research and development efforts that might further enhance the
   usefulness of in vitro assessments of acute systemic lethal toxicity
   were also being developed.

   Completion and publication of the Final Report on the In Vitro Workshop
   is expected in August 2001.

   In Vitro Methods for Assessing Acute Systemic Toxicity is co-sponsored
   by NIEHS, NTP, and the U.S. EPA, and coordinated by ICCVAM and NICETAM.
