   Solar radiation is the driving energy for the geophysical and
   biochemical processes that control weather and life on earth. The
   Integrated Surface Irradiance Study (ISIS) is a continuation of earlier
   NOAA surface-based solar monitoring programs, in the visible and ultra
   violet wavebands. ISIS provides basic surface radiation data with
   repeatability, consistency, and accuracy based on reference standards
   maintained at levels better than 1% to address questions of spatial
   distributions and time trends, at sites selected to be (1) regionally
   representative, (2) long-term continuous, and (3) strategic foci for
   the research that is now needed.

   The Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) operates the NOAA national broadband
   solar radiation network collecting data in both the visible and
   ultraviolet (UV-B) wavebands. ISIS operates at two levels: Level 1
   monitors incoming radiation only, and Level 2 (SURFRAD) focuses on
   surface radiation balance. The map shows the of operating sites and is
   a link to various pages.

   Irradiance Study (ISIS) - A New Surface Radiation Monitoring Program",

   Daily time series plots are available for the previous 30 days. Please
   proceed through the state by state listings to find this data.
                        ____________________________

   The previous month's processed data are available in ascii. Filenames
   are of the following format: ISmonthcity.year
   Example: ISDECORT.Y96

   The instrument list, measurements being reported, and data file format
   are included.

   Earlier data is available from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)
   which archives the data.

   Please contact Detlef Matt if there are any comments or questions.
