      Missions to Mars

      The exploration of planets happens in three stages: flyby, orbit, and
      surface operations. When we were just starting out in solar system
      exploration, the very first missions simply flew by Mars, taking as
      many pictures as possible on their way past. As our knowledge and
      technologies grew, we began putting spacecraft in orbit around Mars for
      longer term studies. Then, with even more capabilities over the years,
      we began to land on the surface. Today, we're not only landing in one
      place, but have shown that we can be mobile on the surface of Mars, as
      well as receive increasingly detailed pictures and other critical data
      from orbit.

      The future of Mars Exploration holds even greater rewards:
      long-distance surface mobility, improved imaging, subsurface
      exploration, and even life-detection technologies. None of our missions
      stand alone. New scientific and technological knowledge is passed on
      from one mission to the next, not only improving our journeys into
      space, but also providing benefits here on Earth.
