                            From the AA's Office

   NOS has numerous channels for providing information to employees and
   senior NOAA Management on NOS news and the progress of our programs.
   This page provides a description of those channels and direct access to
   that information.

   The AA has initiated a new information and discussion forum called the
   NOS Open House. Open Houses are held in the morning on the third
   Wednesday of every month. It is hosted by the AA, attended by the
   Senior Management Council, and open to all employees. An email
   announces the location about a week before each Open House event.

   At the end of each week, the AA or Deputy sends out the NOS Update
   email to all NOS employees. The update includes the week's news and
   notable events, information on budget and administrative matters, and
   program highlights. The NOS Weekly Report is required by NOAA
   Headquarters for ultimate transmission through the Department to the
   White House. It contains submissions from program offices relating to
   major NOS activities. Finally, NOS Quarterly Review and Strategic Plan
   contains NOS' Quarterly Review presentations, presentations given to
   the Under Secretary and NOAA Senior Management on significant NOS
   milestones accomplished in the last quarter, and the NOS Strategic
   Plan.
