                           Shark Observer Program

   Since 1993, an observer program has been underway to estimate catch and
   bycatch in the directed shark gillnet fisheries along the southeastern
   US Atlantic coast. This study is necessary to meet the intent of the
   Marine Mammal Protection and the Endangered Species Acts, and the 1999
   revised Fishery Management Plan for Highly Migratory Species to obtain
   better data on catch and bycatch and discards in the shark fishery.
   Sharks are landed primarily by two types of gear. The most common type
   is drift gillnet gear, wherein the vessel basically sets a gillnet in a
   straight line off the stern. The net soaks or fishes at the surface for
   a period of time, is inspected at various occasions during the soak,
   and then hauled onto the vessel when the captain/crew feel the catch is
   adequate. It is usually a nighttime fishery. The other type of gear
   utilized is strike-netting, wherein the vessel takes its gillnet and
   encircles a school of sharks. This is done usually during daylight
   hours, using visual sighting of shark schools from the vessel and or a
   spotter plane. The gear is encircled around the sharks, but is
   otherwise hauled back onto the vessel without much soak time. More
   information regarding this fishery can be found in:
