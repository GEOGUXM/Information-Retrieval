   Information Abstract The Electronics and Electrical Engineering
   Laboratory (EEEL) promotes U.S. economic growth by providing
   measurement capability of high impact focused primarily on the critical
   needs of the U.S. electronics and electrical industries, and their
   customers and suppliers. This measurement capability promotes economic
   growth by improving the competitiveness of U.S. industries. This
   capability is part of the national infrastructure that helps attract
   and retain businesses and jobs in the United States. EEEL focuses on
   measurement capability that U.S. industries need but cannot provide for
   themselves, for technical, economic, or other reasons. The
   beneficiaries include U.S. industry, government, academia, other
   organizations, and the general public. The supported electronics and
   electrical industries are highly important to the U.S. economy. In
   round numbers, the electronics industry ships $500 billion of products
   each year. The electrical-equipment industry ships the better part of
   $100 billion of products each year. The electric-power industry, a
   service industry, relies on the electrical-equipment industry for power
   equipment and uses that equipment to provide $200 billion of
   electricity each year. These three industries are enabling industries
   for the entire U.S. economy. Virtually all other manufacturing and
   service industries rely on these three industries for equipment, power,
   information and control technology, and related services. EEEL's
   measurement capability is an important part of the tools that
   manufacturers need to conduct research and development toward new
   products, to manufacture those products, to market them successfully,
   and to support them after sale. Successful marketplace exchange
   requires proving product performance to customers, and proving
   compliance with domestic and international requirements that would
   otherwise bar market entry. EEEL's measurement capability is also
   important to the success of the providers of materials, information
   services, and energy. Examples include the telecommunications and
   electric-power providers, as they seek to remain competitive while
   addressing new technical challenges inherent in deregulation. EEEL's
   strategic plan describes important measurement contributions to the
   supported industries and the nation. The projects selected result from
   close interaction with industry and government to identify the needs
   most important to economic growth and competitiveness. Keywords

   (Internet). Printed on January 25, 2001 PREFACE This Strategic Plan
   supports effective management of the Electronics and Electrical
   Engineering Laboratory (EEEL). This laboratory is one of eight that
   provide measurement research and related services at the National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). NIST itself is an agency
   within the U.S. Department of Commerce. The format chosen for the
   Strategic Plan is responsive to the Government Performance and Results
   Act of 1993 (GPRA). (Terms with specially defined meanings in the GPRA,
   like Strategic Plan, have been capitalized.) This Strategic Plan also
   specifies Performance Goals for multiple years. As a result, this
   document supports the development of both the Strategic Plan and the
   Annual Performance Plans required of the Department of Commerce by the
   GPRA. The scope of EEEL's Performance Goals is considerable, so only a
   selection from the most important can appear here. The format of this
   plan was derived from OMB Circular No. A-11, Part 2: Preparation and
   Submission of Strategic Plans and Annual Performance Plans. The table
   below shows how the sections in the OMB circular relate to the sections
   of this plan. Elements (2) and (4) are addressed in a single section of
   this plan called "Goals and Objectives". This approach relates
   Objectives to Performance Goals by stating each Performance Goal
   immediately after the Objective supported. The other four elements
   track one- to-one with the sections of this plan. Circular Section
   Content Circular Section Number EEEL Strategic Plan (1) Mission
   Statement 210.6 Mission Statement (2) Goals and Objectives 210.7 Goals
   and Objectives (3) how they will be achieved 210.8 Strategies (4)

   Annual Performance Plan (5) key factors affecting achievement 210.10
   Factors Affecting Achievement (6) program evaluations used, and
   scheduled 210.11 Program Evaluations The Goals expressed in this plan
   are generally within EEEL's span of influence. The Objectives are
   generally within EEEL's span of control, as defined in the OMB
   Circular. Exceptions are noted where they occur. This plan has been
   written to address Evaluation Factors 1 through 6 of the document
   "Interim Evaluation of Draft Strategic Plans". The Evaluation Factors
   track with elements (1) through (6) above, respectively. Evaluation
   Factors 7 through 10 are addressed in plans at higher organizational
   levels. This approach simplifies the use of this document by the
   Department of Commerce in responding to the GPRA. In some of EEEL's
   other planning documents, EEEL's work is divided into programs that
   provide a structure for description. To track to these programs, each
   Objective in this plan ends with a three-letter code in brackets, such
   as [SEM] for "Semiconductors". This code identifies the EEEL program
   conducting the work. The program names are listed alphabetically below,
   along with the associated codes: Displays DIS Electromagnetic
   Compatibility EMC iii Electronic Data Exchange EDE Law Enforcement
   Standards LES Low Frequency LFQ Magnetics MAG National Electrical
   Standards NES National Semiconductor Metrology NSM Optoelectronics OPT
   Power PWR Radio Frequency RFQ Semiconductors SEM The scope of this plan
   includes all work managed by EEEL, whether conducted within EEEL or in
   other parts of NIST, and whether funded by (1) direct appropriations to
   NIST, (2) other agencies, or (3) other sources outside NIST. All but
   two of the above programs are conducted primarily within EEEL, and they
   draw on skills from the other NIST laboratories as needed. The two
   conducted primarily outside EEEL are shown below along with their
   associated codes. Law Enforcement Standards LES National Semiconductor
   Metrology Program NSM Performing organizations that conduct the work of
   these two programs, and that are outside EEEL, are referenced after
   each applicable Objective in this Strategic Plan. iv ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

   . . . 14 vii viii MISSION STATEMENT The Electronics and Electrical
   Engineering Laboratory (EEEL) promotes U.S. economic growth by
   providing measurement capability of high impact focused primarily on
   the critical needs of the U.S. electronics and electrical industries,
   and their customers and suppliers. U.S. economic growth requires
   international competitiveness, which in turn requires new technology.
   New technology requires new measurement capability, which must be based
   on world-class scientific research. Therefore, EEEL pursues world-class
   capability in measurements to facilitate U.S. economic growth. This
   capability is part of the national infrastructure that helps attract
   and retain businesses and jobs in the United States. This capability is
   an essential tool that industry uses to develop and market new
   products. EEEL focuses on measurement capability that U.S. industries
   need but cannot provide for themselves for technical, economic, or
   other reasons. The needed capability reflects the rapidly changing
   nature of electronic and electrical technologies that are both global
   and critical. Provide Measurement Capability that U.S. Industries
   Cannot Provide NIST provides measurement capability that U.S.
   industries cannot provide Table 1: Manufacturers' for themselves. There
   are several circumstances under which NIST's Challenges assistance to
   industry is appropriate: (1) Special measurement expertise is Research
   and Development required (often multidisciplinary) that is not
   available in industry; (2) Manufacturing industry cannot recover the
   costs of measurement development that is so Marketplace Exchange
   fundamental and so broadly beneficial; (3) NIST's acknowledged
   impartiality After-Sales Support and measurement competence are
   required to gain acceptance among manufacturers, suppliers, and
   customers in order to realize the maximum Table 2: Product benefits to
   the nation; or (4) NIST's imprimatur as the lead U.S. agency for
   Characteristics for measurements is required to gain international
   acceptance so that U.S. Competitiveness products can be sold abroad.
   Performance Quality and Reliability Compatibility Focus on Improving
   Competitiveness Safety EEEL strengthens the U.S. economy by
   strengthening the international competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers.
   To be competitive, a manufacturer Table 3: Marketing Requirements for
   must meet the challenges in Table 1. Success in addressing the first
   two Competitiveness challenges is largely dependent on a manufacturer's
   ability to realize Access to market desirable product characteristics,
   especially those in Table 2. Success in Agreement with customer
   addressing all four challenges in Table 1 requires meeting a number of
   on product characteristics marketing requirements, especially those in
   Table 3. This plan shows how Attractive price EEEL helps manufacturers
   address the challenges in Tables 1, 2, and 3 thus Timely delivery Good
   after-sales support improve their competitiveness. Address Economically
   Significant Industries Table 4: Shipments of Customer Industries EEEL
   assures high impact by addressing three economically significant (2000
   estimates) industries. The estimated annual shipments of these
   industries for 2000 are Industry Shipments ($billions) shown in Table 4
   to the nearest $100 billion. All told, industries with shipments with
   approximately $800 billion per year are the direct Electronics 500
   Electric Power 200 beneficiaries of EEEL's work. Electrical Equipment
   100 800 1 Among U.S. manufacturing industries, the electronics industry
   is the largest in shipments, followed by the automotive and chemical
   industries. The electronics industry is also the largest in employment,
   by a factor of two, with 1.8 million employees. The electric-power
   industry is composed of the providers of electricity, whether
   independent or owned by investors, government, or cooperatives. The
   $200 billion shown in Table 4 is the value of all electricity that the
   providers sell in a year. The electrical-equipment industry makes
   equipment that provides electricity, through products such as
   generators, transformers, and batteries. This industry also makes
   equipment that converts electricity into other useful forms, through
   products such as motors, lighting, and heating elements. The industries
   in Table 4 are enabling industries. All other industries, government
   agencies, and the public rely on these industries for power, equipment,
   information and control technology, and related services. Further
   International Agreement on Measurements EEEL supports U.S.
   international trade by furthering international agreement on
   measurements. A key means of doing this is comparing EEEL's
   measurements with those of counterpart institutes in other nations.
   International agreement is necessary to meet the requirements for U.S.
   competitiveness embodied in Table 3, especially the first two: (1)
   International agreement enables U.S. manufacturers to gain access to
   foreign markets by proving compliance with the growing number of
   international written standards that might otherwise bar product entry.
   (2) International agreement enables U.S. manufacturers to reach
   agreement with their own suppliers and customers, both domestic and
   international, on product characteristics, so that sales can be
   completed. Focus on Highest Impact Needs for Measurement Capability
   EEEL determines the highest impact measurement needs requiring EEEL's
   assistance through workshops, surveys, Table 5: Measurement Assessments
   Published studies, and visits to companies. For example, as shown in
   Table 5, EEEL has developed and published Measurements for
   Competitiveness in Electronics Measurement Support for the U.S.
   Electric-Power measurement-needs assessments for two of the three
   Industry in the Era of Deregulation industries that EEEL principally
   serves: the electronics industry and the electric-power industry.
   EEEL's ability to anticipate industry's measurement Table 6: Industry
   Roadmaps and Sponsors needs benefits greatly from roadmaps developed by
   International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors industry, including
   those in Table 6. The roadmaps Semiconductor Industry Association lay
   out industry's plans for remaining competitive in Optoelectronic
   Technology Roadmap Optoelectronics Industry Development Association
   (OIDA) future years. This information helps EEEL to National
   Electronics Manufacturing Technology understand how industry expects to
   evolve and, Roadmaps National Electronics Manufacturing Initiative
   therefore, what measurement capability industry will Storage
   Technology, Head Metrology Roadmaps need, and when. EEEL assists
   industry in roadmap National Storage Industry Consortium development by
   determining the measurement Optical Disk Storage Roadmap National
   Storage Industry Consortium and OIDA implications for industry's
   planned route to remain Electricity Technology Roadmap competitive.
   Electric Power Research Institute 2 Assure Measurement Accuracy,
   Accessibility, and Applicability EEEL pursues three important aims when
   developing measurement capability needed by the U.S. economy. These
   aims are shown in Table 7 and are highlighted throughout this plan.
   First, EEEL pursues measurement accuracy; above all, the United States
   relies on EEEL to provide the foundation for accurate measurement of
   all electrical Table 7: Aims for EEEL's quantities. Second, EEEL
   pursues measurement accessibility; that is, EEEL Measurement Capability
   translates its measurement capability into forms that are technically
   and Accuracy economically accessible to producers and consumers.
   Without such Accessibility translation, that capability could not be
   readily afforded or adopted. Applicability Finally, EEEL pursues
   measurement applicability, which is the translation of EEEL's
   measurement capability into forms applicable to specific needs. For
   example, a measurement method for voltage applicable at 0.000001 volts
   to support the semiconductor industry would not be applicable at
   100,000 volts to support the electric-power industry, even though both
   measurements rely on the same measurement foundation maintained by
   EEEL. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES (and responsive Performance Goals) Goal 1:
   Strengthen Foundation for All Electrical Measurements The foundation
   for all measurements is based on Measurement Reference Standards. They
   are electronic systems, special devices, or special materials that NIST
   develops or measures. Each Measurement Reference Standard provides a
   high level of accuracy for a measured quantity fundamental to the
   measurement foundation. The expertise of many NIST laboratories is
   necessary to provide all of the Measurement Reference Standards needed
   for the measurement foundation. NIST must transfer accuracy from these
   Measurement Reference Standards to millions of customers in industry,
   government, universities, and other organizations. To do this
   efficiently, NIST employs several approaches; but one is especially
   important for electrical quantities: calibration. NIST calibrates a
   small number of high-performance measurement instruments provided by
   customer organizations. Calibration is done by comparing the
   measurement performance of the instrument against the Measurement
   Reference Standards. The instruments so calibrated are then used by
   customer organizations to calibrate other instruments, for themselves
   and others, and so on in an ever expanding chain of calibrations. In
   this way, NIST delivers accuracy to millions of users through
   commercial instrumentation used in commercial channels. NIST's
   Measurement Reference Standards must have high enough accuracy to
   support the most demanding users, including those pursuing major
   innovations. High accuracy is best achieved by basing the Measurement
   Reference Standards on the fundamental physics of nature. Such a basis
   is believed to be unchanging. Such a basis also furthers accessibility
   by enabling others to build similar Measurement Reference Standards of
   comparable accuracy because the fundamental physics of nature is
   accessible to all. The quantities most important to the foundation for
   electrical measurements are shown in Table 8. The first four
   quantities-time, length, mass, and current-are called base quantities.
   They are especially important because measurements of all electrical
   quantities, as well as many other quantities, are based on them.
   Measurements with improved accuracy or accessibility are particularly
   needed for the 3 quantities checked (7) in the table. Each of these
   quantities is discussed below. Table 8: Then the route from the
   measurement foundation to competitiveness is Measurement discussed.
   Foundation for Electrical Quantities Mass Base Quantities time length
   In the world of measurements, time and length have an advantage
   compared to 7777 mass mass. The Measurement Reference Standards for
   time and length are based on dc current the fundamental physics of
   nature, so they are very accurate and accessible. For Electrical
   Quantities example, time is based on counting a specified number of
   cycles of radiation dc voltage emitted by a cesium atom under special
   conditions. The cesium atom is 7 7 7 7 ac voltage 7 7 7 7 ac current
   accessible to everyone. The Measurement Reference Standard for time is
   power maintained by NIST's Physics Laboratory. Time can be measured
   more impedance accurately than any other quantity. 7 7 7 7 capacitance
   inductance resistance Unfortunately, the Measurement Reference Standard
   for mass is not yet based on the fundamental physics of nature.
   Instead, mass is referenced to a single World Measurement Reference
   Standard, in the form of a kilogram cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy
   kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in
   France. A copy is kept at NIST to serve as the U.S. Measurement
   Reference Standard, and its accuracy is established by comparison with
   the BIPM one. These cylinders are subject to change caused by factors
   such as the release of dissolved gases, or the loss of material during
   handling. This weak member in the measurement foundation limits the
   accuracy of measurements of mass, weight, electrical quantities, and
   other quantities, too. Objective 1.1 addresses this situation by
   referencing mass to the fundamental physics of nature through
   quantum-based electrical phenomena. Objective 1.1: Provide a
   time-invariant definition of mass, and increase the accuracy of the
   determination of the fundamental constants of nature which depend on
   mass, by developing a measurement system for mass that is based on the
   fundamental physics of nature. Performance Goal: Achieve a long-term
   uncertainty of 1x10-8 kilograms/kilogram in monitoring the kilogram
   mass standard by FY2003. [NES] AC Voltage and Current The next
   quantities checked in Table 8 are ac (time-varying) voltage and
   current. These ac quantities are important because, without them, most
   services provided by electronic and electrical systems would not be
   possible; examples include digital computing, wireless communications,
   and electric-power distribution. For many applications, improved
   accessibility or improved accuracy are needed for ac quantities. In
   general, ac quantities are measured by comparison to dc (steady)
   quantities because dc quantities can be measured very accurately.
   However, a loss of accuracy occurs in the comparison. Further, the
   process used for the comparison is expensive. EEEL has been pursuing
   two routes to improvement. First, EEEL has just completed development
   of a lower-cost integrated-circuit device, suitable for industry
   adoption, that relates ac quantities to dc quantities. Industry will
   use these devices to calibrate high-performance instruments [LFQ]. If
   the costs of these devices can be reduced sufficiently, industry may be
   able to build them into high-performance measurement instruments
   directly, thus assuring continued accuracy with reduced need for costly
   calibrations. Second, EEEL is improving the measurement of ac
   quantities by developing a new method for generating ac voltages, to
   improve accuracy. It is described in Objective 1.2. This approach may
   lead to a new Measurement Reference Standard for ac voltage, based on
   the same superconducting quantum effect (Josephson effect) used for the
   present Measurement Reference Standard for dc voltage. 4 Objective 1.2:
   Improve the accuracy of ac voltage measurements by developing an
   ac-voltage source based on the fundamental physics of nature through
   dependency on the Josephson effect. Performance Goal: Demonstrate first
   operational source by FY 2001. [LFQ] Capacitance The last quantity
   checked in Table 8 is capacitance. It is important because it is one of
   three quantities that can be used to impede, and thus control, the flow
   of electrical current. For example, capacitance, when used with
   inductance, enables tuning television transmitters, television sets,
   and wireless devices more generally, to specific channels by impeding
   the signals from all unwanted channels. The present Measurement
   Reference Standard for capacitance is already based on the fundamental
   physics of nature, but its use is too laborious and thus too costly.
   The new approach in Objective 1.3 promises to reduce the labor required
   from months to weeks, for each use. It, too, is based on the
   fundamental physics of nature, in this case through dependency on the
   quantum phenomena of single-electron tunneling and the Josephson
   effect. Objective 1.3: Improve accessibility of capacitance
   measurements by developing a new Measurement Reference Standard for
   capacitance that is simpler to use, less costly, and more transportable
   than the current Measurement Reference Standard, and that is also based
   on the fundamental physics of nature. Performance Goal: Demonstrate
   working approach to new representation of the farad by FY 2003. [NES]
   Routes to Impacting Competitiveness The improvements made to the
   measure- ment foundation for electrical quantities, in Table 9: Mapping
   Measurement Foundation into Competitiveness by a First Route
   fulfillment of Goal 1, impact competitive- ness through two principal
   routes. Improved Measurement Foundation Calibration of instruments with
   higher performance at lower cost The first route is through support of
   high- performance measurement instruments, as Better measurement
   support for R&D and manufacturing shown in Table 9. Such instruments
   Realization of better product performance and quality at lower cost
   directly benefit research, development, and and better ability to prove
   product performance in the marketplace manufacturing, especially
   process control. These, in turn, impact the competitiveness Improved
   competitiveness factors identified in Tables 1, 2, and 3. The second
   route from the measurement foundation to competitiveness is through
   development of application-specific measurement capability. Such
   capability derives its accuracy from the measurement foundation, but
   extends applicability to specific industry problems that cannot be
   addressed with the measurement foundation alone. This extension is the
   subject of Goal 2, which is focused on the electronics industry, and of
   Goal 3, which is focused on the two electrical industries. A similar
   extension must also be made for non-electrical quantities, such as
   length, to support these industries. Extending the measurement
   foundation greatly increases the impact of measurement capability on
   competitiveness, and thus multiplies the benefits of the investment
   made in strengthening the measurement foundation through pursuit of
   Goal 1. 5 Goal 2: Provide Measurement Capability Required for a Table
   10: Basic Product World-Class Electronics Industry Services Information
   Signals The products of the electronics and electrical industries
   provide a variety of generate laser diode control optical switch basic
   services shown in Table 10. The table includes examples of the transfer
   antenna, optical fiber products associated with each basic service. The
   electronics industry is convert sensor, detector focused primarily on
   services related to information signals. These services store memory,
   disk drive are the subject of Goal 2. In contrast, the two electrical
   industries are process microprocessor focused on services related to
   electric power and energy. These rather display liquid-crystal display
   different products and services are the subject of Goal 3. Power and
   Energy generate generator control relay, switchgear EEEL develops
   measurement capability that supports products performing transfer
   transformer, wire all of the information-signal services in Table 10,
   including the products convert motor, lighting, heater shown as
   examples. EEEL's development of application-specific measure- store
   battery ment capability for these products impacts competitiveness
   through all of the mechanisms in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Needed measurement
   capability arises in all three families of electronic materials that
   are the most important enablers of the functionality of electronic
   products. These materials are shown in Table 11: semiconductor (semi),
   optoelectronic (opto), and magnetic (mag). These materials are
   particularly critical to the services checked (7) in the table. Table

   (7) in Table 12 show how these means tie to the factors impacting
   competitiveness. The three means are interdependent; progress in one
   may enable progress in others. The discussion below shows how EEEL's
   Objectives facilitate industry's efforts to realize the desirable
   product characteristics in Table 12, and thus competitiveness. First,
   measurement needs for integration are addressed, since integration
   advances all information-signal services in Table 10. Then, measurement
   needs beyond integration are addressed for three information services:
   display, store, and transfer. Table 12: Mapping Key Means Into Product

   columns across the surfaces of thin, very flat, round "wafers" of
   silicon. Challenges Fabrication productivity can be increased by making
   individual Higher Fabrication Productivity integrated circuits smaller,
   so that more of them can fit on each wafer. smaller circuit elements
   This requires making all of the circuit elements smaller, including the
   bigger wafer sizes transistors, their internal insulating materials,
   and the "wiring" Higher Fabrication Yield interconnections. The
   resulting greater "device density", which is purer input materials
   better processes already doubling every two to three years, lowers
   costs and facilitates Higher Frequencies improving most of the
   performance characteristics in Table 12. microwave circuits However,
   achieving greater device density requires better application-
   optoelectronic circuits specific measurements. EEEL responds in
   Objectives 2.1 to 2.4. Objective 2.1: Develop improved measurements for
   making thinner insulating layers in transistors in integrated circuits,
   and for identifying better insulating materials, with thicknesses down
   to at least 2 nanometers. Performance Goal: Measurement methods
   published by FY 2001. [SEM] Objective 2.2: Support industry's pursuit
   of new, thinner insulating materials for gate stacks by developing a
   suite of dielectric evaluation techniques for characterizing electrical
   breakdown and wear-out of those stacks. Performance goal: Evaluation
   techniques completed by FY 2003. [NSM] Objective 2.3: Support accuracy
   of industrial linewidth standards used for accurate calibration of
   lithography tools for making element sizes down to 100 nanometers.
   Performance Goal: Technical support provided for industrial
   development, and method of "tracing accuracy" to NIST placed in
   service, by FY 2001. [SEM] Objective 2.4: Develop laser power and
   energy measurements to support ultraviolet lasers operating at
   additional wavelengths in the 150-200 nanometer range, including 157
   nanometers, to support imaging even smaller elements in optical
   lithography processes. Performance Goal: Calibration services for
   wavelengths between 150 and 200 nanometers implemented by FY 2002.
   [OPT] Fabrication productivity can also be improved by increasing the
   size of the wafers, so that more integrated circuits can be made on
   each wafer simultaneously. Larger wafer sizes require improved
   measurements for flatness, since flatness must be maintained over a
   larger area. Objective 2.5: Develop measurements for the flatness and
   thickness of wafers as large as 300 millimeters in diameter, with
   measurement uncertainties of only 2 nanometers. Performance Goal:
   Measurement capability delivered in industry-specified form by FY 2001.
   [NSM: Conducted in NIST's Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory.] Higher
   Fabrication Yield Reducing fabrication costs requires high "yield",
   that is a high percentage of working integrated circuits resulting from
   fabrication. Fabrication processes are disturbed by even small levels
   of contamination and even small departures from desired chemical
   composition. In particular, surfaces of integrated circuits must be
   inspected for contaminants and for desired constituents to support
   process development and trouble shooting. To assist in addressing these
   problems, EEEL has just completed development of a measurement method
   for detecting the presence and concentrations of desired and undesired
   atomic elements in integrated circuits with increased speed and
   accuracy, using a superconducting x-ray 7 detector [NSM]. This method
   has been licensed to two companies for development of commercial
   instrumentation. Higher Frequencies Semiconductor integrated circuits
   must operate at ever higher frequencies to achieve higher information
   rates in computer circuits, to support expanding applications of
   wireless communications and local radar, and to avoid congestion at
   lower frequencies. At these higher frequencies, extending into the
   microwave region above 1 gigahertz, the elements of integrated circuits
   behave differently; new measurement capability is needed to determine
   performance and to support product development. In response, EEEL has
   just completed development of measurement methods for determining the
   microwave properties of thin insulating films used within individual
   conducting lines on integrated-circuit substrates [RFQ]. Increasingly,
   optoelectronic components are being fabricated as integrated circuits,
   too. Optoelectronic components offer special capabilities, such as the
   ability to emit light. Epitaxial deposition is an important fabrication
   technique for making many of these components, such as the
   vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) used as light sources
   for local-area fiber-optic networks. However, control of fabrication
   processes, especially while they are occurring (real-time), is
   presenting major measurement challenges. In response, EEEL has just
   completed development of data and real-time measurement methods for
   controlling the thickness and composition of layered structures during
   their growth by epitaxial deposition [OPT]. EEEL is now proceeding to
   develop additional support for these fabrication processes by providing
   measurement methods for source gas purity, which must be maintained at
   very high levels to assure working devices. Objective 2.6: Provide data
   and measurement methods for the purity of source gases used in the
   growth of layered structures by epitaxial deposition to form
   optoelectronic components. Performance Goal: Measurement methods for
   source gas purity documented by FY 2001. [OPT] Display The use of
   flat-panel liquid-crystal displays is essential for competitiveness in
   portable computers and portable video products and is becoming
   increasingly important for competitiveness in desktop computer
   monitors. The United States is not a significant manufacturer of these
   displays; but U.S. manufacturers need special measurements to specify,
   evaluate, and purchase the displays. Objective 2.7: Provide measurement
   methods for display performance for use by U.S. industry when
   specifying, evaluating, and purchasing flat-panel displays for computer
   and video products. Performance Goal: Comprehensive flat-panel display
   measurement standard completed by industry by FY 2001. Within EEEL's
   span of influence, but outside EEEL's span of control. [DIS] Store
   Storage of information signals is accomplished by three principal
   methods: (1) semiconductor memory in the form of semiconductor
   integrated circuits, supported by the measurement efforts described
   above in the section on "Integration"; (2) optical disk drives; and (3)
   magnetic disk drives, discussed below. All three methods employ digital
   techniques. Pursuit of greater information density is critical to
   competitiveness of magnetic disk drives. At present, information
   density in magnetic disk drives is increasing at a rate of 60 percent
   per year. To support further advances, Measurement Reference Standards
   are needed for calibrating the special microscopes 8 that industry uses
   to develop products employing ever smaller magnetic patterns. EEEL has
   just completed development of a Magnetic Imaging Reference Sample
   (MIRS) containing magnetic patterns of accurately known dimensions in
   the vicinity of 1 micrometer [MAG]. Next, EEEL will address
   measurements methods capable of imaging magnetic patterns down to 10
   nanometers. Objective 2.8: Develop a magnetic resonance imaging
   measurement method capable of 10 nanometer resolution and quantitative
   measurements, rather than the qualitative measurements of other
   magnetic imaging approaches. Performance Goal: Demonstrate working
   approach employing sensing elements in the form of cantilevers,
   fabricated as micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), by FY 2002. [MAG]
   Also, for magnetic disk drives, higher data transfer rates, based on
   higher frequencies for reading and writing, are also a major factor in
   competitiveness. Data transfer rates are currently increasing by about
   40 percent per year. Especially needed are measurement methods for
   determining the time required to magnetize (switch) the individual bits
   (1 or 0) of information. In response, EEEL has just completed
   development of a measurement method for switching times in magnetic
   materials with resolution of 0.1 nanosecond to support data rates of 1
   gigabit per second or higher, versus the present 100-200 megabits per
   second [MAG]. Transfer Optical-fiber communications systems are
   critical to the national infrastructure and are dependent upon
   continued advances in measurement capability to support improvements in
   performance, quality control, and compatibility for components.
   Especially needed are Measurement Reference Standards for the
   calibration of instruments that measure critical quantities. EEEL has
   just completed development of Measurement Reference Standards to
   support accurate measurement of (1) wavelengths of light, with focus on
   the 1280-1560 nanometer range [OPT]. This work supports: (1)
   wavelength-division multiplexing for increased information capacity;
   and (2) propagation characteristics critical to specifying the
   information capacity of an optical fiber. The emergence of new
   microwave products, such as roadside communications, vehicle
   anti-collision radar, and automatic traffic-light controls, motivates
   the use of higher frequencies from 75 gigahertz to 100 gigahertz. These
   higher frequencies are less used than lower frequencies and offer
   special properties such as controllable range to minimize interference
   with nearby systems. New measurement capability is needed to support
   the development of the antennas required for these new applications.
   Objective 2.9: Develop the facilities and methodology needed for
   near-field scanning antenna measurements in the region 75-100
   gigahertz. Performance Goal: Facility improvements and methodology
   implemented by FY 2001. [RFQ] Microwave products are moving
   increasingly into the consumer domain, especially in the form of mobile
   and handheld communications devices for voice and data. As this
   transition takes place, both reducing costs and increasing energy
   efficiency (to maximize operating time on batteries) become paramount
   to competitiveness. Both of these aims are advanced by the use of
   non-linear components. They are less expensive and more energy
   efficient than the linear components relied on primarily to date.
   However, existing measurement capability for non-linear components is
   less than optimal to support product design and testing in industry. As
   a first step toward resolving this problem, EEEL needs to determine
   industry's existing measurement capability. 9 Objective 2.10: Establish
   industry's current capability for measuring the non-linear behavior of
   radio-frequency circuits, with a special emphasis on power amplifiers,
   through a measurement intercomparison employing a modeled non-linear
   verification device. Performance goal: Complete intercomparison by FY
   2002. Within EEEL's span of influence, but outside EEEL's span of
   control. [RFQ] The emergence of more electronic products emitting
   electromagnetic signals has increased the need to assure that products
   with critical electronic components, such as motor vehicles, are not
   susceptible to harmful interference. International standards for
   susceptibility testing are particularly needed. Objective 2.11: Provide
   technical support in pursuit of U.S. and international acceptance of
   reverberation-chamber measurements as a standard method for compliance
   testing for electromagnetic susceptibility. Performance Goal: Domestic
   and international acceptance realized by FY 2001. Within EEEL's span of
   influence, but outside EEEL's span of control. [EMC] Goal 3: Provide
   Measurement Capability Required for World-Class Electrical Industries
   The measurement needs of the electrical-equipment industry are driven
   by many of the same competitiveness Table 14: Basic Power and Energy
   Services factors that apply to the electronics industry. The eff rel
   equ env pq electrical-equipment industry supplies equipment to the
   generate generator * * * automotive industry, the appliance industry,
   and virtually control relay, switchgear ** ** * * every other
   manufacturing industry. The electrical- transfer transformer, wire ** *
   ** * equipment industry also provides equipment to the electric-
   convert motor, lighting ** * * * * power industry, which, of course,
   plays an especially store battery * * * critical role in the national
   infrastructure. The driving forces influencing these two electrical
   industries are usefully considered together and as a combination of
   competitiveness challenges and broader national challenges. Table 14
   expands on the lower half of Table 10 by showing the principal points
   of intersec- tion between basic power and energy services and national
   challenges. The challenges are energy efficiency (eff), the reliability
   and stability of the national power system (rel), equity in revenue
   metering (equ), environmental quality (env), and power quality (pq).
   The intersections of the challenges with the basic power and energy
   services are indicated by the presence of a box ( ), with or without a
   dot (*) in it. EEEL has provided measurement capability helpful in
   addressing many of these challenges. Each intersection in Table 14 that
   is the subject of EEEL work described below is marked with a dot in the
   box (**). Deregulation is being introduced to realize the benefits of
   domestic competition. It will give customers a choice of providers,
   based on market factors, such as price and quality of service.
   Deregulation, and its implications for needed measurement support, are
   examined in detail in EEEL's study of the electric-power industry,
   listed in Table 5. In Objectives 3.1 and 3.2 below, EEEL is responding
   by providing measurement capability helpful in addressing (1) equity in
   revenue metering; (2) control of the power network to assure
   reliability and stability; and (3) energy efficiency in use. Equity
   Under deregulation, electricity will be generated by more providers and
   will be delivered to users through a shared transmission and
   distribution system, just as shared highways and railways enable moving
   merchandise. Accurate revenue metering, at a greater number of sites,
   will be needed to track ownership and to support equitable volume
   billing for electricity moving through the shared system. In response,
   industry has developed electronic watthour meters with higher accuracy
   over wider ranges. 10 To support these, EEEL has just completed
   development of a new capability to support the calibration of
   electronic watthour meter standards that provide high accuracy at five
   times the voltage and twenty times the current of earlier designs.
   Next, EEEL will extend support to meters capable of accurate
   measurement in the presence of harmonics. Harmonics are unwanted
   electrical power at higher frequencies. Harmonics will become
   increasingly significant as the power grid becomes more complex.
   Objective 3.1: Develop the technical capability required to support
   electronic watthour meter standards that provide high accuracy for
   measurements of electric power containing harmonics. (Performance Goal:
   Build and test sampling system for harmonic power measurement by FY
   2001.) Reliability and Stability As the national electric-power system
   becomes more complex under deregulation, it will also become more
   challenging to control. Particularly needed are improved measurement
   sensors for providing the data required by control systems to assure
   the reliability and stability of the system. Optical sensors for
   electrical quantities are especially promising. These sensors resist
   interference, interface readily with optical fibers for transfer of
   data to control systems, and enable more measurements at more locations
   throughout the electric-power system. EEEL has just completed
   establishing the feasibility of using optical sensors to achieve
   improved accuracy in measuring ac current. Next, EEEL will seek to
   extend the dynamic range of the calibration support that it provides
   for these sensors. This improvement will support expanding applications
   of the sensors, particularly for bidirectional power measurements of
   independent suppliers, who are sometimes suppliers and sometimes
   consumers of electricity. They have high current output when producing
   electricity, but small current input when consuming electricity.
   Objective 3.2: Extend calibration support for optical current sensors
   to current levels a factor of ten smaller than now to support current
   measurements of wider dynamic range. (Performance Goal: Expand the
   calibration support by FY 2001.) Efficiency Power distribution
   transformers perform the last voltage reduction just before the
   delivery of electricity to end users. High efficiency in these
   transformers is essential to the overall efficiency of the electric-
   power system. In response, EEEL has just completed validation of the
   measurement methods and statistical sampling protocols needed to
   determine the energy efficiency of power-system distribution
   transformers operating at 35,000 volts and below. Goal 4: Provide
   Technical Support to Law Enforcement EEEL manages a special NIST-wide
   program, authorized by the Congress, that supports the criminal-
   justice community. That community includes law enforcement,
   corrections, crime laboratories, fire services, and the court system.
   This program exploits the measurement and standards capabilities of
   NIST in diverse fields of science and technology to benefit this
   community in several ways: (1) to reduce injury and loss of life in law
   enforcement encounters; (2) to improve the quality of justice and
   security by increasing the reliability of techniques used for
   investigations and identification; and (3) to hold down the costs of
   public safety. This program is funded entirely by other Federal
   agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Transportation, and
   the Executive Office of the President. For example, this program just
   completed a standard for stab- and puncture-resistant armor which has
   been issued by the National Institute of Justice. New work focuses
   increasingly on readiness for coping with the effects of weapons of
   mass destruction used by terrorists. 11 Objective 4.1: Support the
   Office of Domestic Preparedness and the Office of State and Local
   Domestic Preparedness Support in the fight against terrorist incidents
   involving chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction by
   developing guidelines for detection, decontamination, and
   personal-protection equipment for use by emergency first responders.
   (Performance goal: Draft guidelines completed by FY 2001. Within EEEL's
   span of influence but outside EEEL's span of control.) Conducted
   jointly with the National Institute of Justice, the Interagency Board
   for Equipment Standardization and Interoperability, the National
   Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, the Occupational Safety
   and Health Administration, the U.S. Army Soldier and Biological
   Chemical Command, and the National Fire Protection Association, In
   addition, this program is exploring the next step in this effort: the
   development of national standards for detection, decontamination, and
   personal protection equipment for addressing weapons of mass
   destruction. This exploration involves a diversity of cognizant
   agencies and associations. STRATEGIES (how the Goals and Objectives
   will be achieved) Resources (human, capital, and information) EEEL's
   Goals are repeated in Table 15, along with the resources applied to
   each in FY 2000. If these levels of resources can be continued in
   constant dollars, they will support pursuit of EEEL's goals to the
   extent described below. Seventy-three percent of EEEL's funding comes
   to NIST by direct appropriation. This funding supports work broadly
   beneficial to the national economy. The rest of EEEL's funding comes
   from "other agencies" and "other outside" organizations, as
   reimbursements for measurement services they require. Goal 1: This is
   EEEL's first priority, since strengthening the measurement foundation
   underpins all progress in measurements. Resources are adequate for
   pursuit of core activity but are less than needed for advances to
   support innovative new technologies developed by industry. Goal 2: This
   is EEEL's second priority. EEEL can address selected measurement needs
   of the electronics industry, including those in the Objectives.
   However, the broader needs are many times greater, based on EEEL's
   study of the electronics industry in Table 5, which integrated
   information from many key information resources, and on the roadmaps in
   Table 6. Resources are less than needed. To make up the shortfall, EEEL
   will pursue budget initiatives and support from other Federal agencies
   when possible. To maximize leverage, EEEL focuses on electronic
   materials and components that are the basis for diverse electronic
   products. Goal 3: This is EEEL's third priority. EEEL can address
   selected measurement needs of the two electrical industries, including
   those in the Objectives. The broader needs are many times greater,
   based on EEEL's study of the electric-power industry in Table 5, which
   integrated many key information resources. Resources are less than
   needed. To make up the shortfall, EEEL will pursue budget initiatives
   and support from other Federal agencies when possible. Goal 4: All
   funding is provided by other Federal agencies and is adequate to the
   tasks requested of NIST. Communication, Accountability, and Other
   Factors Goals and Objectives are developed with the EEEL staff and
   managers, and are communicated during that process. This plan is
   published and posted on the Internet for other agencies, customer 12
   organizations, and the general public. EEEL managers and staff are held
   accountable through individual performance plans. EEEL programs, as
   presently designed, are suitable for achieving the Objectives stated
   here. No legislative changes are required to enable the achievement of
   those Objectives. Table 15: FY 2000 Resources Managed by EEEL Funding

   AFFECTING ACHIEVEMENT (external) The most important challenge to EEEL
   is keeping pace with the growing number and complexity of measurement
   needs, as electronic and electrical technologies advance rapidly on a
   global basis. One form of EEEL's response is to assist industry in
   developing roadmaps because they provide early warning of impending
   measurement needs. The roadmaps are shown in Table 6. NIST faces
   considerable technical complexity in its work because NIST does only
   what industry cannot do for itself. EEEL responds by hiring able staff
   and by assisting NIST in planning the facilities required to support
   world-class research. Implementation of the NIST's Advanced
   Measurements Laboratory, now under construction, is the most important
   facilities improvement affecting the long- term health of EEEL's
   measurement program. The world of written, or documentary, standards is
   changing. Written standards are generally developed by the private
   sector. They address product performance, quality, compatibility, and
   safety, among other topics. When embodied as international standards,
   they affect market entry and U.S. competitiveness for many products.
   EEEL joins the rest of NIST in examining industry arguments for a
   different, and possibly increased role, for NIST in written standards,
   particularly when effective representation of U.S. interests in
   international standards bodies is at stake. If an a different or
   increased role is determined to be in the national interest, then a
   competing demand for NIST's resources may result. PROGRAM EVALUATION
   EEEL plans its program primarily through prospective evaluation of
   needs. EEEL continues to review program relevance throughout its own
   research-and-development stages in order to guide the work to a
   successful conclusion and to facilitate timely transfer to the user. 13
   EEEL monitors its outputs: (1) reimbursed services such as calibrations
   services and sale of Measurement Reference Standards for calibrating
   instruments; (2) joint activities, such as participation in
   written-standards organizations, professional societies, trade
   associations, and cooperative research, used for discovery of needs and
   delivery of findings; and (3) communications, such as publications,
   conference presentations, and consultations, used for delivery of
   findings and discovery of needs. EEEL's output quality is assessed each
   year by an outside panel of impartial experts from industry,
   government, and universities, convened by the National Research
   Council, which publishes the findings. EEEL measures outcomes through
   economic impact Table 16: Economic Impact Studies studies which sample
