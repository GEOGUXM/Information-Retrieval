   RECRUITING TOOLKITS
   Are you going recruiting? If you are planning to recruit at a college,
   university, or conference, these toolkits are an excellent way to help
   yourself to the materials and information you will need to have a
   successful recruiting effort. These materials are designed to guide you
   through interviews, plan your on-site Information Session, assist you
   in determining what kinds of materials you should take with you, and
   link you to valuable LANL websites to respond to candidate questions.
   Please select the toolkit for your recruiting event and print! If you
   need any assistance with these tools or have any questions, the HR-5
   Recruiting Staff can assist you. Send your questions via email or call
   665-8832 for assistance.


   RECRUITING METHODS

   Advertising
   Placing a job ad is not enough; it is only one piece in an advertising
   strategy. Developing a comprehensive advertising strategy that meets
   your organization's hiring needs is essential to finding the right
   candidate for you.

   When you request an ad placement, we commit to:
    1. Research and recommend the best advertising solution.
    2. Advertise to the largest possible audience in order to solicit a
       diverse candidate pool.
    3. Offer proactive advertising possibilities.
    4. Give you the biggest bang for you buck! AND ALL THIS IN A TIMELY
       MANNER.

   To get started today developing an advertising strategy tailored to
   your organization's hiring needs, contact Carina Stefaniak.

   Entry Level Hiring For Technical Staff Member (TSM) Positions
   The Laboratory has an expedited process for hiring recent graduates for
   Technical Staff Member positions. The purpose of this program is to
   increase the number of qualified entry level strategic hires. No
   advertising is necessary for those candidates who meet the following
   criteria:
     * degree in a technical field
     * demonstrated exceptional ability, as shown by grade point average
     * outstanding faculty recommendations, publications, patents, and
       other indicators of positive achievements in their chosen field
     * are within one year of having completed their Bachelors, Masters,
       Ph.D., or the completion of a Post-Ph.D. appointment in an
       engineering or scientific discipline

   In support of Los Alamos National Laboratory's efforts to increase the
   number of entry-level Technical Staff Members (TSMs), the University
   Hiring Program provides an expedited process for hiring recent
   college/university graduates as TSMs.

   Completion of a hiring package for an entry level TSM hire is
   simplified; use the University Hiring Program Checklist as a guide. For
   more information, call the Recruiting Office at 667-8849 or email us.
   University Relations
   The Recruiting Team in HR-5 (Staffing) coordinates an intensive college
   recruiting program. Based on LANL hiring needs, diversity issues, and
   academic reputation, a "core" list of schools has been identified for
   targeted recruiting. Teams of technical recruiters visit campuses and
   conduct interviews as well as attend career fairs. Technical recruiters
   obtain and maintain faculty contacts at universities, identify top
   candidates for UGS, GRA, Postdoc, and full time, entry level positions,
   and maintain on-going contact with students.

   Recruiters are the key link between the job seeking student and
   Laboratory hiring organizations. This link is made by routing resumes,
   speaking to colleagues, and hosting on-site interviews. Recruiters are
   selected based on their recruiting/hiring experience, their ability to
   obtain and maintain faculty and student contacts, and on references
   from supervisors. Effective recruiters are dedicated and committed to
   enhancing the diversity and strategic direction of the Laboratory.
   Contact the Recruiting Team for a list of Recruiter Recommended
   Candidates.
