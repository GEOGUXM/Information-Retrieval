   Washington Management Service Study
   The 2001-03 Operating Budget directed JLARC to conduct this study of
   the Washington Management Service (WMS), a personnel system established
   by the Legislature in 1993 for management-level positions within the
   Executive branch of state government.  Consistent with the mandate, the
   study focuses on employee and salary growth, as well as other
   compensation practices of the WMS.  Information is also presented on
   how the WMS is viewed by human resource staff within the larger state
   agencies and on the extent to which other states have similar
   programs.

   Department of Corrections Community Supervision Study
   As directed in the 2001-03 operating budget, this JLARC operational
   review evaluates the Department of Corrections' (DOC) implementation of
   the 1998 JLARC recommendations about community supervision, the 1999
   Offender Accountability Act (OAA), and the risk-based model for
   classifying and supervising offenders in the community.  The report
   also includes DOC field staff perspectives on the implementation of OAA
   and the risk-based model, and lessons learned from other states on the
   use of risk-based models.

   K-12 Special Education Study
   The 2000 Supplemental Operating Budget mandated this JLARC study of
   Special Education.  It focuses on the special education safety net,
   created in 1995 following changes to Washingtons special education
   funding formula, as a result of a previous JLARC study.  The
   feasibility of determining individual school districts need for safety
   net funds is addressed, as are options for strengthening the current
   process whereby school districts are monitored for compliance with
   regulations.  Additionally, the report focuses on the role of the State
   Auditors Office in the safety net process, together with the
   methodology that school districts are required to use for reporting
   their special education expenditures when applying for safety net
   funds.  OSPI has not concurred with most of JLARCs recommendations, and
   the JLARC response to OSPIs reaction is included in this proposed final
   report. (Report 01-11, 12/12/01)

   Unemployment Insurance Call Centers Evaluation  Legislation enacted in
   1998 (SSB 6420) allowed the Washington State Employment Security
   Department to accept initial applications for unemployment insurance
   benefits over the telephone and via the Internet.  The legislation also
   directed JLARC to evaluate the new call center approach to unemployment
   insurance.  This JLARC report assesses the performance of the call
   centers compared to the previous system and examines the link to
   re-employment services, which are services geared to getting unemployed
   workers back to work.   It also assesses the departments progress in
   meeting the goals it had articulated in making the change to call
   centers.  JLARC makes five recommendations to improve Employment
   Securitys performance.   (Report 01-10, 9/26/01)

   [PDF] Preliminary Work on Future Sunset Reviews - Intermediate Driver
   License Program, Office of Public Defense, and Underground Storage Tank
   Program  This report covers the first three programsIntermediate
   Drivers License Program, Office of Public Defense, and Underground
   Storage Tank Programsubject to Washington States new Sunset Law,
   enacted in the 2000 Session [C 189 L 00; Chapter 43.131 RCW], which
   places greater responsibility on agencies and programs subject to the
   Act.  A key change is that agencies subject to the Sunset Law are now
   required to develop performance measures and a data collection plan,
   and submit them to the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee
   (JLARC)with the two-fold purpose of 1) reaching consensus early on as
   to what measures will be used to evaluate the programs when it is time
   to conduct the sunset reviews, and 2) ensuring that the necessary data
   will be available.   (Report 01-6, 6/27/01)  [PDF]   Full report

   [PDF] Welfare Reform and WorkFirst, The Challenges of Finding and
   Keeping a Job,  The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee
   (JLARC), together with the Institute for Public Policy, has been
   assessing the impact of Washingtons 1997 welfare reformWorkFirstsince
   its beginning in 1997.  This final phase of that evaluation focuses on
   the question: Do post-employment services make a difference in keeping
   welfare recipients employed?  And we found that they do: these services
   help raise earnings and help people stay employed.  Part 1 of the
   report provides a brief overview of what we have learned to-date from
   JLARCs evaluation of WorkFirst.  Part 2 contains the Institute for
   Public Policys report on the findings of its post-employment analysis.
   Part 3 concludes with follow-up information on WorkFirsts
   implementation of JLARCs major recommendations of the past three
   years.  (Report 01-5, 6/27/01)  [PDF]   Full report available online.

   WorkFirst Evaluation Summary: How Successful Has WorkFirst Been?  What
   Happens Next? (JLARC) This report summarizes JLARC has learned about
   WorkFirst and its success in meeting the mandates and objectives
   established by the legislature.  An additional focus includes detail on
   the possible impacts of the 5-year time limit on welfare benefits,
   which will impact some clients in August of 2002.  Based on analysis
   conducted in this and other states, it appears the potential negative
   impact of time limits may not be as severe as some had originally
   predicted.

   Investing In The Environment: Environmental Quality Grant & Loan
   Programs Performance Audit This JLARC-initiated study examines the
   performance of 12 capital budget-funded grant and loan programs that,
   together, fund over $400 million in environmental quality projects
   during the 1999/01 Biennium.  The audit reviews the performance of
   these programs from an investment perspectivea new way of examining the
   performance of such programs.  Two questions are addressedwhat are the
   results of the investments made thus far, and which investment
   practices are in place to produce desired long-term results?  The audit
   finds that many programs lack key features for fostering sound
   long-term environmental investments.  Recommendations to improve
   program investment performance and grant and loan services to local
   governments are made.

   Mentally Ill Offenders: Study of the Impact of 2SSB 6214 This 1998
   measure was passed in response to the fatal stabbing of a retired
   Seattle firefighter outside the Kingdome by an individual with a
   history of violent acts and civil commitments.  The Act made changes to
   the states civil commitment and criminal competency laws.  Overall,
   this report finds that the Act is seen as having a generally positive,
   but somewhat limited effect on achieving its goals.  A total of six
   recommendations are included, relating to: the conduct of criminal
   competency evaluations; the duration of misdemeanant criminal
   competency restoration commitments; and ensuring that pertinent
   information is made available to the various entities that are impacted
   by the Acts provisions.

   Mental Health System Performance Audit The 1999 Legislature mandated a
   broad performance audit of Washingtons public mental health system to
   include the roles and responsibilities of the different organizations
   involved, the cost and outcomes of mental health services, and the
   allocation of funding to the 14 county-operated Regional Support
   Networks (RSNs).  This performance audit finds a lack of effective
   coordination of services to clients with multiple needs.  Also, current
   system oversight activities measure service activities, rather than
   outcomes.  Moreover, fiscal, client, and service data collected by the
   state are not consistent, and inequities in funding to the RSNs lead to
   inequities of services available to clients.  The report makes 14
   recommendations: to improve the coordination of services; to improve
   the consistency of data collected; to reduce process-oriented
   accountability activities; to establish a system of measuring outcomes;
   to increase equity in the distribution of funding; and to promote
   practices to provide services in a cost-effective manner.

   Commission (PDC) activities, staffing, budget and resource allocation
   practices.  The JLARC report recommends improvements in the PDCs major
   duties of information disclosure and enforcement including steps to
   improve the agencys electronic disclosure system as well as steps to
   reduce the enforcement caseload.  The report also addresses specific
   PDC staffing issues and other agency duties.  Comparative information
   on campaign finance disclosure agencies in other states is also
   included.

   Diabetes Cost Reduction Act Sunset Review  - This report finds that
   while utilization of the health benefits provided in the Act can,
   according to clinical studies, result in improved health outcomes, less
   is definitively known about the Act's cost-effectiveness.  The report
   recommends that the legislature repeal the sunset provision attached to
   the Act so that the Act will continue; and that the Department of
   Health conduct an evaluation of the Act's long-term effectiveness.
   (Unless the sunset provision is repealed, the Act will terminate on
   June 30, 2001.)  (Report 00-1  1/6/2000)

   Involuntary Commitment of Mentally Ill Persons: Study of the Impact of
   SSB 5562 Briefing Report  - This report finds the impact of the Act may
   be more limited than intended because many people in the mental health
   system are unfamiliar with it. The report recommends that the Mental
   Health Division, within the Department of Social and Health Services,
   take steps to ensure that all counties have available information on
   the Act, and also coordinate a discussion on how information about
   policy changes should be communicated in the future.
