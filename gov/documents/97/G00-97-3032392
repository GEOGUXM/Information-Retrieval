                      OFCM COORDINATION INFRASTRUCTURE

   OFCM operates with policy guidance from the Federal Committee for
   Meteorological Services and Supporting Research (FCMSSR). The
   Chairperson of FCMSSR is the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and
   Atmosphere, and Administrator of NOAA. The members of the FCMSSR are
   senior policy executives from the 14 federal agencies with
   meteorological programs. In addition to reviewing OFCM activities and
   providing policy guidance, FCMSSR is the final forum to resolve agency
   differences.

   The two Program Councils, chaired by the Federal Coordinator and
   directly under FCMSSR, coordinate key programs at the highest
   interagency policy decision-making level, and ensure that the programs
   meet joint requirements. In addition to establishing policy, the
   program councils coordinate development and oversee the preparation and
   implementation of national program plans which include R&D, systems
   development, validation and integration, acquisition strategy,
   operational concepts, agency roles, and management.

   The Interdepartmental Committee for Meteorological Services and
   Supporting Research (ICMSSR), chaired by the Federal Coordinator, is
   the primary program management body of the Federal coordinating
   structure. ICMSSR provides advice to OFCM, implements FCMSSR policies,
   and oversees the committees and working groups that address observing
   systems, weather operations and services, operational processing
   centers, and automated weather information systems.

   The Committees and their Working and Joint Action Groups provide at the
   program and working level (1) a forum for each agency to report
   activities, difficulties, and achievements; (2) a mechanism for
   coordinated change and problem solving; (3) a medium for collection,
   documentation and consolidation of agency requirements and inventories;
   (4) oversight for coordinated system development; (5) a vehicle for
   coordinating with other groups; and (6) a mechanism for the preparation
   of studies, agreements, standards, protocols, reports, and national
   plans.
