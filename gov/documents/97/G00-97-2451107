   United States District Court Northern District of Mississippi Office of
   the Clerk BILLS OF COST REFERENCE NOTES (JANUARY 2002) These notes are
   offered by the Clerk of Court merely as an aid in preparing bills of
   costs in civil actions in this court. These notes are not an
   authoritative statement of the law or practice in the United States
   District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. This
   compilation has not been reviewed or approved by any judge of this
   court. It does not necessarily represent the views of any judge of this
   court. It is not legal authority and should not be cited in motions or
   other papers supporting or opposing costs-related issues. It is neither
   legal advice nor an explanation of the law governing bills of costs.
   Prevailing Party. Generally, the prevailing party in a civil action is
   entitled to recover its costs for a limited range of expenses allowed
   by statute. The decision whether to award costs is vested in the trial
   judge. See Card v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 126 F.R.D. 658, 660
   (N.D. Miss. 1989) ("The trial court has discretion to award costs to a
   prevailing party."), citing Nissho-Iwai Co., Ltd. v. Occidental Crude
   Sales, 729 F.2d 1530, 1551 (5th Cir. 1984). Standards of Review. The
   district court's standard of review of the clerk's taxation of costs is
   de novo. See American Steel Works v. Hurley Const. Co., 46 F.R.D. 465
   (D. Minn. 1969). The appellate standard of review of a district court's
   costs determination is "abuse of discretion." Pierce v. Underwood, 487
   U.S. 552, 557 (1988); see also Stearns Airport Equipment Co. v. FMC
   Corp., 170 F.3d 518, 536 (5th Cir. 1999), and Fogelman v. ARAMCO, 920
   F.2d 278, 285 (5th Cir. 1991). Generally, - The plaintiff is the
   prevailing party when it recovers on the entire complaint. The
   defendant is the prevailing party when the case is terminated by
   judgment in favor of the defendant or on court-ordered dismissal. The
   court may determine the prevailing party when the case is voluntarily
   dismissed or when there is a partial recovery or recovery by more than
   one party. But note- "[W]here the plaintiff who files the case
   originally in the Federal courts is finally adjudged to be entitled to
   recover less than the sum of $75,000, computed without regard to any
   setoff or counterclaim to which the defendant may be . . . entitled,
   and exclusive of interest and costs, the district court may deny costs
   to the plaintiff and, in addition, may impose costs on the plaintiff."
   28 U.S.C. § 1332(b). What to file. A party claiming costs must file a
   verified bill of costs containing an affidavit attesting that each
   claimed item is correct, that each claimed item was necessarily
   incurred in the case, and that the services for which fees were charged
   were actually and necessar- ily performed. 28 U.S.C. § 1924. The
   standard federal form for the bill of costs is Bill of Costs Form AO
   133 and is available at the clerk's offices in Oxford, Aberdeen, and
   Greenville and on the Northern District's website:
   www.msnd.uscourts.gov Go to the Forms option The court's form contains
   a listing of items recoverable as costs, a worksheet for capturing
   expenses and fees for witnesses, and the necessary affidavit. If costs
   are presented on a properly completed AO 133 or the form available at
   the court's website, a separate affidavit or verification is not
   necessary. Although the conclusory statement in application to tax
   costs that "each item of cost or disbursement claimed is correct and
   has been necessarily incurred in the above action" may be sufficient in
   support of an unopposed motion to tax costs, such evidence clearly
   falls short of meeting prevailing party's burden of proof after
   necessity and reasonableness of costs have been challenged by opposing
   party. See Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., 684 F.2d 1087,
   1098-99 ("Courts are not accountants and defendants should not be
   tagged with either cost or expense bills that are horseback estimates.
   Those who are -2- entitled to recover costs and expenses bear the
   burden of furnishing a reasonable account- ing."). When to File. A
   prevailing party "shall serve the bill of costs not later than thirty
   days after entry of judgment. . . . [A]n appeal . . . shall not affect
   the taxation of costs." (Emphasis added). Rule 54.2(A), UNIFORM LOCAL
   RULES OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT
   AND THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI (Dec. 1, 2000, ed.)
   [hereinafter LOCAL RULES]. LOCAL RULE 54.2(A) notwithstanding, the time
   for filing a bill of costs or objections thereto is not jurisdictional;
   accordingly, an untimely bill or objections to a bill may be considered
   even if tardy. See United States v. Kolesar, 313 F.2d 835, 837 n.1 (5th
   Cir. 1963). The period for serving the bill may be enlarged under FED.
   R. CIV. P. 6(b). Id. A judgment is "entered" on the date it is recorded
   in the court's docket. See FED. R. CIV. P. 58 (a judgment is effective
   only when entered as provided in Rule 79(a)). A copy of this entry is
   served contemporaneously on all parties. Entry of a judgment may be
   further verified by examining the public copy of the court's docket
   through the PACER electronic process or by calling the Clerk's Office.
   Neither a bill of costs nor an objection to a bill of costs involves
   reconsideration of the decision on the merits of a civil action.
   Consequently, such a motion or application is not one to alter or amend
   the judgment under FED. R. CIV. P. 60(b) and it does not render
   ineffective a notice of appeal filed prior to disposition of costs
   issues. Buchanan v. Stan- ships, Inc., 485 U.S. 265, 268-69 (1988); see
   also Samaad v. City of Dallas, 922 F.2d 216, 217 (5th Cir. 1991).
   Application for Attorneys' Fees Distinguished. Unlike bills of costs,
   motions or applica- tions for attorneys' fees are not reviewed by the
   Clerk. Accordingly, prevailing parties should not combine an
   application for attorneys' fees in a bill of costs-they should be
   submitted as two separate and distinct applications. See FED. R. CIV.
   P. 54(d)(1) and (d)(2). Items Recoverable as Costs. "Costs" is not
   synonymous with "litigation expenses." Items allowable as recoverable
   costs are listed in 28 U.S.C. §§ 1821, 1920, 1921, and 1923. If a
   litigation-related expense is not specifically listed in these
   statutes, it probably is not recoverable as an item of compensable
   costs. The following categories of expenses are recoverable under 28
   U.S.C. § 1821: -3- * A witness's attendance fee ($40 per day) when
   subpoenaed or summoned for appearance at discovery or at trial. * A
   witness's mileage allowance (36½¢ per mile), plus charges for parking,
   tolls, taxicabs, and "all normal travel expenses." * A witness's
   "actual expenses of travel . . . at the most economical rate reasonably
   available" when traveling by common carrier. * Airport terminal parking
   fees. Ezelle v. Bauer Corporation, 154 F.R.D. 149, 154 (S.D. Miss.
   1994). * A witness's daily subsistence allowance (per diem) ($85 per
   day, Oxford, Aberdeen, and Greenville; call Clerk's Office for rates
   for other localities) when overnight stay away from home "is required
   at the place of attendance because such place is so far removed from
   the residence of such witness as to prohibit return thereto from day to
   day." Note: The rule in the Northern District of Mississippi is that
   absent a reasonable explanation, there is a presumption that a witness
   subpoenaed to trial but not called to the stand is not a necessary
   witness and attendance fees and related expenses are not recoverable
   costs. See Morris v. Carnathan, 63 F.R.D. 374, 377 (N.D. Miss. 1974). *
   Same statutory fees apply to expert witnesses. Unless specifically
   ordered by the court, the expert's fees for his or her expertise are
   not recoverable as an item of costs. See Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph
   Coors Co., 684 F.2d 1087, 1100 (5th Cir. 1982) ("Expert witnesses
   generally may be allowed only the fees allowed `fact' witnesses, . . .
   . If counsel plan to seek allowance of the entire expert's fee, the
   better practice is to seek court approval before calling the expert
   witness."); Card v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 126 F.R.D. 658, 661
   (N.D. Miss. 1989) ("Costs for expert witnesses are limited to the costs
   which would be allowed other witnesses under [U.S.C.] Sections 1920 and
   1821."). * As to whether a corporation, as the prevailing party, may
   recover the witness fee, witness mileage allowance, and per diem of its
   corporate representative, who is not personally involved in the civil
   action and who testifies for the corporation, compare Morrison v.
   Alleluia Cushion Co., Inc., 73 F.R.D. 70, 71 (N.D. Miss. 1976) (not
   allowed), with Ezelle v. Bauer, 154 F.R.D. 149, 154-55 (S.D. Miss.
   1994) (allowed). -4- The following categories of expenses are
   recoverable under 28 U.S.C. § 1920: * Fees of the clerk, including
   filing fees and statutorily-defined docketing fees. Card, 126 F.R.D. at
   660 (N.D. Miss. 1989) ("Court fees are allowed as costs whether they
   are fees which are paid when the action was initially filed or when the
   action was removed."). * U.S. Marshal's fees. See 28 U.S.C. § 1921 for
   an itemization of marshal's fees recoverable as costs. The U.S. Marshal
   does not serve civil process except (i) on behalf of the United States
   as a party, (ii) in proceedings classified as in forma pauperis, and
   (iii) on writs of seizure and execution. See Rule 4.1(B), LOCAL RULES.
   For bill of cost determinations, state and local law officers and
   private process servers are not the equivalent of U.S. Marshals-their
   service of process fees are not recoverable in a bill of costs. See
   Collins v. Gorman, 96 F.3d 1057, 1059 (7th Cir. 1996) ("Changes in the
   rules of procedure [allowing service of process by any person who is
   not a party and is at least eighteen years of age] mean that § 1920(1)
   covers a smaller portion of the costs of litigation than it used to;
   but that develop- ment does not alter the meaning of the word
   `marshal.' A private process server may be faster or cheaper . . . ,
   but the private process server does not become a `marshal.'"). *
   Reporters' fees for transcripts that are necessarily obtained for use
   in the case. For a discussion of deposition-related expenses that are
   recoverable in a bill of costs, see 10 Charles Alan Wright et al.,
   FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE, Civil 3d § 2676 (1998). The phrase
   necessarily obtained for use in the case is a term of art. A prevailing
   party seeking an award for stenographers' fees and expenses might want
   to ensure that his or her claim meets the standards enunciated in the
   following authorities, among others: Fogelman v. ARAMCO, 920 F.2d 278,
   286 (5th Cir. 1991)("Prevailing parties are entitled to recover the
   costs of original depositions and copies under 28 U.S.C § 1920(2) and §
   1920(4) . . . provided they were `necessarily obtained for use in the
   case.'"). "Use in the case" means that a transcript must have a direct
   relationship to the determination and result of the trial. Loewen v.
   Turnipseed, 505 F.Supp. 512, 517 (N.D. Miss. 1980). -5- The cost of a
   deposition may be taxed even if it is used just to structure ques-
   tioning at trial, but only if the court in its discretion believes the
   taxation of costs to be justified. Ezelle v. Bauer Corporation, 154
   F.R.D. 149, 155 (S.D. Miss. 1994). Stearns Airport Equipment Co., Inc.
   v. FMC Corporation, 170 F.3d 518, 536 (5th Cir. 1999) ("it is not
   required that a deposition actually be introduced in evidence for it to
   be necessary for a case-as long as there is a reasonable expectation
   that the deposition may be used for trial preparation, it may be
   included in costs."). Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., 684 F.2d
   1087, 1099 (5th Cir. 1982) ("While some cases hold that the costs of
   depositions are taxable only if they were either introduced in evidence
   or used at trial in examining or impeaching witnesses, the more
   equitable as well as more practical view is to allow the recovery of
   such expense if the taking of the deposition is shown to have been
   reasonably necessary in the light of facts known to counsel at the time
   it was taken." See also Nissho-Iwai, 729 F.2d 1530, 1553 (5th Cir.
   1984) (use of a deposition to structure questioning met the "reasonably
   necessary" standard). * Fees for printing, photocopying, and for
   witnesses. Fees for witnesses are governed by 28 U.S.C. § 1821, as is
   stated above. Printing and photocopying expenses are recoverable if the
   materials were necessarily obtained for use in the case and the
   prevailing party demonstrates that necessity. See Stearns Airport
   Equipment Co., Inc. v. FMC Corporation, 170 F.3d 518, 536 (5th Cir.
   1999), and Fogelman v. ARAMCO, 920 F.2d 278, 286 (5th Cir. 1991). If a
   document that is otherwise allowable as an item of costs requires
   notarization, the notary's fee may also be recovered. A claim for
   photocopy expenses should show at least the following information: *
   Date copies were made * Identification or description of document
   copied * Purpose of the copies, or the reason they were made * Number
   of pages in original * Number of copies made * Total number of pages
   copied -6- * Price per copy (25¢ per page approved in Herdahl v.
   Pontotoc County School Dist., 64 F. Supp. 1113, 1120 (N.D. Miss. 1997)
   * Total photocopy charges. A grid similar to the one below may prove
   useful (but is not mandatory) in organizing, presenting, and justifying
   claims for photocopying expenses: Purpose (or Total No. Document
   Recipient) Pages in No. Copies Pages Per Page Total Copy Date Copied of
   Copy Original Made Copied Copy Price Charge $ $ Generally, a prevailing
   party is allowed as a matter of course, without further documenta-
   tion, to recover costs for up to five sets of copies of pleadings,
   motions, proposed orders, notices, and other documents docketed in the
   clerk's office and served on the party- opposite. This allows one copy
   for counsel's office files, one copy for opposing counsel, one copy for
   counsel's client, one copy for the trial judge, and a copy for the
   clerk's office. Additional copies are routinely allowed in actions
   involving more than one party-oppo- site. Items Generally NOT
   Recoverable as Costs. See generally, 10 Charles Alan Wright et al.,
   FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE, Civil 3d § 2677 (1998). * Incompletely
   or inadequately documented expenses. Documentation supporting the bill
   of costs should include, when appropriate, copies of canceled checks,
   receipts for payments, invoices or bills for expenses, or other
   documentation reasonably showing that an allowable expense was in fact
   paid by the prevailing party. * Attorneys' fees and travel expenses
   incurred in connection with deposition taking. See J.T. Gibbons v.
   Crawford Fitting Co., 760 F.2d 613, 616 (5th Cir. 1985). * Fees charged
   by state or local law officers, or by private process servers, for
   service of subpoenas and summons. * Witness attendance fees, mileage
   allowances, and subsistence for parties. * Messengers. -7- * Telephone
   expenses or tolls, including long-distance charges and conference call
   charges, unless agreed to by the parties and/or specifically allowed by
   the court. See Ezelle v. Bauer Corporation, 154 F.R.D. 149, 155 (S.D.
   Miss. 1994). Issues related to telephone and other communications
   expenses are usually best resolved in the pretrial order. See Rule
   16.2, LOCAL RULES. * Charter airfares for witnesses, including expert
   witnesses, unless agreed to by the parties and/or specifically allowed
   by the court. Issues related to charter airfares are usually best
   resolved in the pretrial order. See Rule 16.2, LOCAL RULES. * Experts'
   professional fees for their testimony, unless agreed to by the parties
   and/or specifically allowed by the court. Issues related to experts'
   fees are usually best resolved in the pretrial order. See Rule 16.2,
   LOCAL RULES. See, e.g., Coats v. Penrod Drilling Corp., 5 F.3d 877,
   891(5th Cir. 1993) (experts' fees not recoverable under 28 U.S.C. §
   1920), and J.T. Gibbons v. Crawford Fitting Co., 760 F.2d 613, 616-17
   (5th Cir. 1985) ("The Supreme Court long ago established as a general
   rule that expert witness fees are not taxable as costs beyond the
   statutory per diem fee, mileage, and subsistence allowance provided in
   28 U.S.C. § 1821."). For excep- tions in a narrow range of cases, most
   notably civil rights cases, see Jones v. Dia- mond, 636 F.2d 1364, 1381
   (5th Cir.), cert. dismissed sub nom Ledbetter v. Jones, 453 U.S. 950
   (1981). * Expenses for photographs, graphic enlargements, charts,
   models, demonstrative evidence, and other exhibits, unless agreed to by
   the parties and/or specifically allowed by the court. Issues related to
   expenses of exhibits are usually best resolved in the pretrial order.
   Rule 16.2, LOCAL RULES. See Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. Kellstrom,
   50 F.3d 319, 335 (5th Cir.) (district court may authorize production of
   trial exhibits if such would "facilitate the just, speedy, and
   inexpensive disposition of the action," but absent pretrial approval a
   prevailing party may not seek taxation of costs for exhibits), cert.
   denied, 516 U.S. 862 (1995); Card v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 126
   F.R.D. 658, 662 (N.D. Miss. 1989) ("The cost of videotape and
   duplicates of slides will not be allowed because these costs were not
   approved and were not necessarily obtained for trial. Costs for
   demonstrative aids are not usually allowed."), aff'd without opinion,
   902 F.2d 957 (5th Cir. 1990). But note: In Ezelle v. Bauer Corp., 154
   F.R.D. 149, 155 (S.D. Miss. 1994), the court ruled that "Costs
   pertaining to videotapes are not taxable without prior authorization by
   the court and are not included under 28 U.S.C. § 1920." The clerk for
   the Northern District of Mississippi has not applied Ezelle to claims
   for -8- videotaped depositions. The use of videotaped depositions is
   expressly allowed and, with respect to experts, expressly encouraged.
