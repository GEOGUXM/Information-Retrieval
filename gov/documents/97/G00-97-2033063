      The Education Program of the Sustainable Seas Expeditions


   The sanctuary serves as a living classroom for teachers and students at
                                  Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary.

           The Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary serves as a living
                             classroom for teachers and students.

   This section of the SSE Web site describes the goals and objectives of
   the SSE Education Program, provides access to educational materials,
   links to descriptions of professional development activities for
   teachers and education events for students, and offers information on
   informal educational media and activities. Also included is an archive
   of education events, summits and resources from the 1999 SSE field
   season.

   Background: In April 1998, the National Geographic Society, in
   partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA), launched the Sustainable Seas Expeditions to explore the U.S.
   National Marine Sanctuaries and promote the need for greater marine
   conservation. One of the SSE's primary goals is to provide people with
   rich educational experiences, both through the drama of underwater
   exploration itself and the compelling photographs and video footage
   that document these little-known areas. To achieve the objectives of
   increasing regional and national interest in the marine sanctuaries,
   while addressing the national need to

   i
   mprove marine education for young and old alike, the National
   Geographic Society and NOAA established a team to develop educational
   activities and programs that involve many partners and collaborators.

   The SSE education program has four primary elements:

   (1) Developing Teacher Materials: SSE strives to provide high-quality
   marine science teaching materials that are linked to national standards
   in science and geography. One of the project's main goals is to provide
   teachers with the tools to bring new technologies, new knowledge and
   new learning opportunities to students.

   (2) Providing Professional Opportunities for Teachers: SSE provides a
   multifaceted approach to teacher professional development. Programs
   such as Teacher-in-the-Sea and Teacher-at-Sea provide special
   opportunities for teachers to conduct research with SSE scientists. In
   addition, the SSE reaches out to a broader audience of teachers through
   a series of hands-on and virtual training workshops.

     Ventura High School students toured the sanctuary aboard the National
   Park Service vessel, Ocean Ranger,during the SSE mission to the Channel
                                                                  Islands.

   (3) Developing Educational Opportunities for Students: These include
   Student Summits, Students-at-Sea (direct participation in a mission),
   and Web chats and Web casts. Each sanctuary host several educational
   events during the course of an SSE mission.

   (4) Providing Informal Educational Activities: Informal educational
   opportunities include exhibits, family activities, public programs,
   books, television programs, magazine articles and the Web. The National
   Geographic Society estimates that SSE has, during its first two years,
   potentially reached more than 200 million people through newspaper,
   radio and television coverage.
