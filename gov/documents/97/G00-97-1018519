                      URAA, GATT Amendments to U.S. Law

     On December 8, 1994, President Clinton signed the "Uruguay Round
     Agreements Act" (URAA). The URAA implements the Uruguay Round
     General Agreement on Tariffis and Trade (GATT), which includes an
     agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
     (TRIPS). Several provisions of the URAA amend the U.S. copyright law
     at 17 U.S.C. 104A, 109(b); the URAA also adds a new Chapter 11 to
     title 17 and a new section 2319A to title 18. The effective date for
     restoration of copyright for works from countries that are currently
     eligible is January 1, 1996.
