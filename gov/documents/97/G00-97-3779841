   Purpose
   To present current diagnostics tools and research activities to
   practicing engineers, building operators, and others who may be
   involved in early adoption of emerging technologies.

   To obtain feedback and spark discussion on current diagnostic
   approaches and identify strategies to bring the results of these
   research activities into practice

   Technical Scope
   Potential topics include all aspects of commercial building
   diagnostics, including market analysis, sensor quality, data
   acquisition, use of design info (black box vs. white box), approaches
   and applications to specific problems, and preventative maintenance.
   Also, methods and tools for performance verification, fault detection
   and diagnosis.
