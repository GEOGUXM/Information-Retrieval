      Description of research projects:

      Development of a year-round culture for strawberries, utilizing
      controlled environment, protective covers, and soil-less substrates.
      Optimize production of stolons/plantlets in soil-less substrates and
      enhance out-of-season fruit production. Develop production and machine
      harvest systems for bramble fruit acceptable for fresh market sale.
      Study resource storage/allocation and environmental factors effecting
      reproductive organ development in strawberry (Fragaria) and blackberry
      (Rubus). [MVC-001k.JPG] [MVC-003X.JPG]

      B.  Strawberries in a greenhouse hydroponic setting.

      C.  Strawberry runner tips with some adventitious roots.  These
      plantlets will develop into plug plants that can  be used in
      plasticulture and greenhouse hydroponic systems.
