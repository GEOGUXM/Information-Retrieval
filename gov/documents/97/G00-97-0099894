       Please be patient!  We have TONS of data (Hundreds of megabytes,
       actually), and have only begun the long and arduous task of pulling
       it all together!
       In the mean time we are making available very basic information on
       the multitude of field surveys we have done over the years.  It is
       raw information, only, and pretty sparse at that!  We apologize for
       the work you'll have to do to (maybe) find the surveys that will
       help you.  One of the things we are working on is to have a search
       engine for accessing this database, along with a lot more
       information related to each job to give you better clues as to
       which job may have the survey information you are looking for.
       We are giving you the file in two different formats, depending on
       what you want to do.   The first is in Excel 97 format.  If you
       know Excel, you can manipulate the data any way you want to try and
       find what you are looking for.   We will be updating the file as we
       add more information.
       If all you want to do is to look at the information, we also have
       it available in Adobe Acrobat v3.0 format.  If you have their free
       reader, you can read and print the information, but not manipulate
       it.
       If you find something in the listing that interests you, please
       call (916) 324-4834 for further information on how to obtain
       copies.
