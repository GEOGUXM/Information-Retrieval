   Technical Activities

   The formal specification for the materials markup language, MatML, is
   described in the MatML Document Type Definition (DTD). While this
   document is still a working draft undergoing revision, it includes
   extensive descriptive information as well as sample markup and
   represents the efforts to date of a cross section of the international
   materials community with contributions from private industry,
   government laboratories, universities, standards organizations, and
   professional societies. Annotated MatML DTD Version 2.0

     NISTIR 6785, MatML - Materials Markup Language Workshop Report The
    MatML Workshop Report NISTIR 6785, MatML - Materials Markup Language
   Workshop Report is now available. This international workshop was held
    at NIST during 26-27 June 2001 to address the technical and strategic
     future of MatML, an application of XML for materials property data.

   Catalog of Examples
   Please note that these examples illustrate the flexibility of MatML
   even if MatML is not yet optimized. The purposes of these examples are
   to provide informative illustrations for potential users and to uncover
   the strengths and weaknesses of the MatML Working Draft in order to
   optimize MatML and move it forward to proposed recommendation status.
   (Example: Notice the information redundancy in the markup that must be
   addressed in a future version of MatML.)
   The visitor interested in the markup of complex materials systems such
   as composites is referred to the journal article example.
