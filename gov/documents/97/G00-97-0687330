   The Morris K. Udall Foundation

   [clear_dot.gif] The Morris K. Udall Foundation was established by the
   U.S. Congress in 1992 to honor Morris King Udall's thirty years of
   service in the House of Representatives.

   Morris Udall's career was distinguished by civility, integrity, and
   consensus, as well as a commitment to preservation of the nation's
   natural environment. Consistent with these values, the Udall Foundation
   is committed to educating a new generation of Americans to preserve and
   protect their national heritage through studies in the environment,
   Native American health and tribal policy, and effective public policy
   conflict resolution.

   The Foundation's activities are supported by the interest accrued in a
   federal trust fund and by contributions from the private sector. The
   Udall Foundation is an executive branch agency. The President of the
   United States appoints its board of trustees with the advice and
   consent of the U.S. Senate.
