   The United States and the Department of Energy face enormous challenges
   as we clean up legacy waste from past weapons production; provide
   clean, affordable energy; and protect our national security. This
   requires innovative, science-based technology and engineering
   solutions. The Environmental and Energy Sciences (E&ES) Division is
   providing these solutions. Staff in E&ES participate in a complete
   range of research and technology development to fully explore
   ideas--from fundamental science investigation to instrument prototype
   development to field demonstrations and technology licensing.

   We conduct a wide range of basic and applied research aimed at
   developing new knowledge and understanding of complex systems. Our
   major R&D programs have the following characteristics:
     * Laboratory Intensive - involving state-of-the-art experimental,
       computational and field research facilities.
     * Multidisciplinary - involving teams of researchers combining
       multiple scientific disciplines
     * Collaborative - involving collaborations with scientists from
       academia, industry and other federal laboratories
     * Problem Solving Orientation - involving close collaboration with
       engineering scale-up and technology deployment

   The E&ES Division provides scientific and engineering support to all
   the missions of DOE -- Science, Environmental Quality, Energy and
   National Security. We support the other research divisions at the
   Laboratory by providing staff and research capabilities that contribute
   to the more applied programs at INEEL.

   We are responsible for the Laboratory's Subsurface Science Initiative.
   This initiative is providing a new signature for INEEL -- substantially
   increasing the science base at the Lab, developing new research
   programs and developing enhanced research capabilities in the
   Subsurface Geosciences Laboratory (SGL). This new $150M facility will
   be a signature facility for INEEL providing unique meso-scale research
   capability to DOE and the Nation. We are also responsible for the
   Advanced Computing & Collaboration Initiative, and the Nanomaterials
   Division Initiative.

   The E&ES Division is composed of the following departments:

   Geosciences Research - improving our understanding of the coupled
   chemical, biological, and physical processes in the subsurface, and how
   these processes affect the transport of water and contaminants.
   Researchers are designing better remediation approaches, improving
   vadose zone and groundwater monitoring technologies, and advancing
   modeling capabilities to provide more realistic risk and performance
   assessments.
     Contact: Robert Smith, 208-526-9345, rqs@inel.gov

   Applied Geosciences - providing critical support for INEEL's
   Environmental Remediation and High Level Waste Programs, Environmental
   Affairs and numerous other site operations. Support includes regulatory
   site characterization and sampling services, flow and transport
   computer modeling and analyses of the effects of contaminant releases
   on human health and the environment.
     Contact: Greg Stormberg, 208-526-1241, gjs@inel.gov

   Chemistry - advancing the science of surface analysis through new
   analytical methods, and developing novel synthetic materials for
   industrial applications. Areas of research include mass spectrometry,
   polymers and industrial separations science, supercritical fluids,
   theoretical chemistry and thermodynamics, specialty biomedical
   chemistry, and ion mobility spectrometry.
     Contact: Michael McIlwain, 208-526-2820, mem@inel.gov

   Materials - improving understanding of the relationships between
   processing and materials properties, and developing new
   characterization techniques for metals, ceramics and composite
   materials. Areas of research include nanocomposite and particulate
   materials development, fracture mechanics, advanced ceramics,
   engineering, biocorrosion of metals utilizing new scanning probe
   microscopy techniques, and computational materials science.
     Contact: Richard Wright, 208-526-6127, rnw2@inel.gov

   Physics - developing measurement systems, often with emphasis on
   hardened, noncontact sensors for field measurements, industrial process
   control, or in-situ use. Staff are active in plasma physics for
   materials processing and have extensive simulation capabilities.
   Specific disciplines include optical spectroscopy, nonlinear optics,
   nondestructive examination with acoustic and electromagnetic
   techniques, and fluid dynamics.
     Contact: Jack Slater, 208-526-7544, jxs@inel.gov

   Prototype Engineering Laboratories - developing instrument prototypes,
   experimental electronic instrumentation, and providing design
   consultation to INEEL scientists and engineers and industry customers,
   for the development, assembly, and testing of one of a kind items and
   mechanical and electronic system prototypes. Support includes design,
   machining, fabrication, modeling, assembly, design validation and
   testing services.
     Contact: Doug Speirs, 208-526-9035, speirsdr@inel.gov

   Analytical Laboratory - providing comprehensive analytical support for
   INEEL site cleanup and waste management activities. This includes
   organic, inorganic, and radiochemical laboratory services, Resource
   Convservation & Recovery Act (RCRA) and Department of Transportation
   (DOT) sample certification, and chain-of-custody sample management.
     Contact: Rod Hand, 208-526-3057, rlh2@inel.gov

   The INEEL is the only consolidated national laboratory and operating
   site in the DOE complex--a situation that offers unique research and
   engineering opportunities. The Environmental and Energy Sciences
   Analytical Laboratory and the Applied Geosciences organizations provide
   critical day-to-day technical support to the Laboratory's Environmental
   Restoration and Waste Management programs as well as other on-going
   research programs.
