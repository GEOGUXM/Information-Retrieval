   The Fission Energy and Systems Safety Program (FESSP) is one of the
   major programs in the Energy and Environment Directorate at Lawrence
   Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), encompassing at any given time
   more than 80 projects for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the
   Department of Energy (DOE), and other government agencies. FESSP is a
   work-for-others program providing technology support to government and
   industry and is committed to applying the advanced science and
   engineering capability of the Laboratory to the protection of public
   health and safety and to the advancement of technology in fission
   energy and the nuclear fuel cycle.

   In fulfilling its mission, FESSP provides technical support and
   services in the areas of:

     FISSION ENERGYAll elements of the nuclear fuel cycle
     (cradle-to-grave) including the handling of nuclear materials and
     waste management.
     SYSTEMSWith a focus on risk-based regulations, performance-based
     requirements, automation systems, and integrated approaches to
     information security.
     SAFETYWith a focus on technology development and application.

   In addition to its own staff, FESSP has immediate access to the
   Laboratory's scientific and engineering personnel and other resources.
   FESSP can provide technical support in areas such as risk and hazard
   analysis; structural and thermal analysis; containment, shielding, and
   criticality analysis; accident analysis; environmental assessments;
   radiation protection; and quality assurance.
