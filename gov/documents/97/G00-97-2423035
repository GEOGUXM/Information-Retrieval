   Overview:
   Redevelopment was created by state law to help cities renew
   themselves.  It infuses needed capital into these communities,
   empowering them to assume control of distressed areas to orchestrate
   their re-growth.

   In Long Beach, oversight for the redevelopment process is provided by
   the Redevelopment Agency of the City of Long Beach, which is governed
   by a seven-member Board appointed by the Mayor and approved by the City
   Council.

   What is Redevelopment?
   Redevelopment is a tool that can be used to bring new life in areas of
   the city that need rehabilitation. In 1964, the Long Beach
   Redevelopment Agency, in cooperation with the City of Long Beach,
   embarked upon a diversified, dynamic redevelopment plan to breathe new
   life into the city.  A portion of property taxes known as the "tax
   increment," as well as government grants, have been used to improve
   those areas of the city facing serious blight.  Partnerships were
   developed with private developers, businesses, state and federal
   agencies, non-profit and cultural organizations and neighborhood groups
   in order to get the job done.

   As the City of Long Beach prepares for the 21st century, we are now
   well-positioned at the gateway to the Pacific Rim as a beautiful,
   cultured, diverse and economically-energized community in which to
   conduct business and to live.

   Redevelopment Project Areas
   Since the Long Beach Redevelopment Agency was formed in 1961, seven
   redevelopment projects have been adopted.  The Project Areas include:
   Downtown, West Beach, Poly High, West Long Beach Industrial, Los Altos,
   Central Long Beach, and North Long Beach.
