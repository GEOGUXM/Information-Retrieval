   Grace spacecraft getting prepped The JPL-managed Gravity Recovery and
   Climate Experiment (Grace) is undergoing final preparations for its
   launch in early March. The identical twin Grace spacecraft will fly in
   tandem to measure variations in Earth's gravitational field. Results
   from this mission will yield crucial information about the distribution
   and flow of mass within the Earth and its atmosphere.

   California mosaic from Shuttle Radar Topography data Displaying
   spectacular new 3-D images and animations of California from space,
   scientists at JPL announced the release of high-resolution topographic
   data of the continental United States gathered during the February 2000
   Shuttle Radar Topography Mission -- a mission that is creating the
   world's best topographic map.

   All Days Are Not Created Equal
   Spacer
   Earth Some days don't just seem longer than others -- they are. Knowing
   exactly how Earth's rotation varies may lead to better models of the
   atmosphere and oceans, improved weather prediction and even assistance
   in spacecraft navigation.
