     The Board is proposing a regulation change (See " Special Notice to

     January testing date and content of the examination (i.e., Only Laws
     and Regulations section or Both Laws and Regulations and Patient
     Management sections) is not known at this time. Applications and
     requests for testing will not be accepted until examination content
     is determined. Please continue to consult our home page for updated
     information concerning January testing.
