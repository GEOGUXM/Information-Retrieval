   federal government will award more than $1.2 billion to small companies
   for innovative research. * How can your company have the federal
   government underwrite its R&D costs? * How can faculty members tap into
   this funding source? * How can community entrepreneurs access these
   funds? * What does it take to win? * How can you prepare a successful
   proposal? SBIR/STTR Overview Workshop This workshop will assist high
   technology and bio/medical companies, entrepreneurs, and faculty
   members in determining if they can qualify for SBIR/STTR grants.
   Participants will receive up-to-date information about federal agency
   solicitations and contracts. Topics will include qualifications for
   submitting SBIR/STTR applications, proposal preparation guidelines, and
   agency selection criteria. Differences between SBIR & STTR grants, as
   well as requirements for "fast track" consideration, will be explained.
   SBIR/STTR Success! Course This course has been designed for bio/medical
   and high tech companies, entrepreneurs, and faculty members who want to
   submit SBIR or STTR grant proposals for the NIH April 2002 deadline.
   The course will take participants through the proposal preparation
   process step-by-step. By utilizing specially designed worksheets,
   analytical writing skills, and feedback from experienced reviewers,
   participants will develop proposals that have the greatest chance of
   being funded. Each session will focus on a different part of the
   proposal. Agency guidelines and criteria will be presented. Experienced
   grant writers will critique participants' weekly writing assignments.
   Recent experience shows that participants in this course have a funding
   success rate better than the national success rate. James Moran,
   D.Eng., will again conduct the sessions. Individuals experienced in
   grant writing and review will be utilized in evaluating draft
   proposals. Course Instructor: James M. Moran, D.Eng. Jim Moran has
   worked as a research scientist, medical device engineer, and
   entrepreneur for twenty five years, primarily in the Greater Cleveland
   area. He holds three engineering degrees, including a Doctor of
   Engineering degree, from Cleveland State University, where he was also
   an instructor from 1979 to 1987. He is a member of the American Society
   of Mechanical Engineers and the Orthopaedic Research Society, and has
   published the results of his musculoskeletal research in a number of
   leading journals. Most recently, Dr. Moran was the Chief Technical
   Officer at BIOMEC Inc., a start-up medical device company that now has
   offices in Minneapolis, Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati. While at
   BIOMEC, he helped develop a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
   program that was awarded 31 Phase I and two Phase II SBIRs in only the
   first 3 years of operation. How to Register Mail, Fax or E-Mail
