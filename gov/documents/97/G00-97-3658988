   Health Consequences of the Gulf War
   An Ongoing Analysis


   Health Consequences of the Gulf War - An Ongoing Analysis has been
   published to give veterans of that war additional information about
   illnesses some veterans have experienced. This report provides a review
   of the Federal Government's efforts to address concerns about about
   these illnesses.

   The electronic version is available in either HTML (needing just your
   web browser) or PDF (requiring Acrobat Reader and frames - but
   duplicates the hard copy version).

   In addition, while a supply exists, hard copies are available to
   veterans by request. A single copy may be obtained by calling the Board
   at (202) 565-6363 or sending an email to the Board with your name and
   address.
