   LANDSAT 7 Software
   IAS Software
   The IAS receives Level 0R products (raw data organized in a digital
   image format with associated files) from the USGS EROS Data Center
   Distributed Active Archive Center (EDC-DAAC) and performs off-line
   assessment of image quality to ensure system compliance with the
   spacecraft and sensor radiometric and geometric requirements via Level
   1 processing (radiometric and geometric correction) and image
   evaluation and analysis.
   The IAS software is also used to periodically calibrate the
   instrument's radiometric and geometric properties which results in an
   updated calibration parameter file (CPF). This file is required for
   Level 1 processing and is sent to the International Ground Stations and
   the EDC-DAAC where it accompanies each Level 0R product ordered

   LPS Software
   Source code for the LANDSAT 7 Processing System (LPS), an element of
   the U.S. Government LANDSAT 7 Ground System, is now available to those
   interested.
   The LPSs principal functions are capturing raw wideband data from the
   LANDSAT 7 satellite through the LGS, processing the captured data to
   L0R, copying the data to Digital Linear Tape (DLT), and cooperating in
   the transfer of the L0R data files to EDC DAAC.

   LPGS-Lite Software
   Software from the Level-1 Product Generation System has been modified
   by the University of Maryland to run on POSIX-compliant systems. It is
   now distributed by RemosteSensing.Org, an open-source consortium for
   GIS software. For further information or to download the LPGS-Lite
   software please visit their site at:
