                               FX-Collaborate

   FX-Collaborate (FXC) is an exploratory development project started in
   1998 to study architectural issues involved in implementing
   collaboration and distributed databases. The initial approach was to
   develop an operational prototype system that would assist us in
   exploring these issues while simultaneously collecting information from
   users about what constitutes an effective collaborative system.

   The system has been developed using Java's Remote Method Invocation to
   emulate many capabilities in the National Weather Service (NWS)
   Advanced Weather Inteactive Processing System (AWIPS), while enabling
   remote users to synchronize their displays for effective collaboration.
   In addition, FXC includes interactive capabilities such as
   drawing/annotation tools and a chatroom, and allows sharing of local
   datasets between sites. Communication may be over a private network or
   the internet; if the latter, Web pages can be shared and annotated.

   The list of possible applications of FXC includes weather forecast
   coordination between offices, classroom training, briefings from NWS to
   other government agencies (severe weather, emergency management), field
   experiment support, and research coordination.

   Currently, a demonstration system is being used in Georgia and
   surrounding states featuring collaboration between the National Weather
   Service/Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Emergency Management
   Agency, and state Emergency Management agencies. The Air Force is also
   planning to use FXC to support pre-launch weather briefings at its
   space operations centers in California and Florida.

   The current software has been tested on systems running Windows95,
   Windows98, Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Linux (on both PCs and a Mac
   G3 Powerbook).
