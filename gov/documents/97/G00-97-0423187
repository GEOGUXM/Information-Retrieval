   [Fill2.gif] The Science Education Team and space science groups at Los
   Alamos National Laboratory are committed to the improvement of space
   science education throughout the state of New Mexico and the nation as
   a whole. Through a variety of enhancement programs, we have helped
   students and teachers increase not only their space science content
   knowledge, but also their critical thinking and problem solving skills.

   We invite you to peruse the background for Los Alamos Space Science
   Missions and our site of lessons and classroom activities developed for
   the LASSO project, a combination of on-going NASA projects that include
   Los Alamos National Laboratory science instrumentation and personnel.
   These lessons and activities, appropriately designed for a variety of
   educational levels and based on the actual science learned from the
   LASSO projects, were prepared by teams of teachers from northern New
   Mexico. In addition to the lessons and classroom activities, we have
   included numerous links to appropriate space science sites and a
   glossary of space science terms. A new addition to the site is a photo
   gallery of student work based on the LASSO lessons. New pictures will
   be added as they are received.

   The space science projects included in the LASSO project to date:

     * ACE - Advanced Composition Explorer - focus on Solar Wind
       composition
     * TWINS - Two Wide Angle Imaging Neutral Atom Spectrometers - focus
       on how the Magnetosphere parts interact
     * GENESIS - Solar Wind Sample Return Mission - focus on the Solar
       Wind elemental and isotopic composition
     * Lunar Prospector - remote sensing to explore the nature and
       composition of the Moon
     * LIBS - Mars Instrument Development Program - lasers used to
       determine chemistry of rock and soil particles - testing a
       prototype instrument for NASA's Mars exploration program.

   We hope you enjoy and benefit from the work published by our teachers.

   Application Materials
   _______________________

   If you are tasked to teach a science curriculum or have an opportunity
   to implement a space science unit in your classroom, you may want to
   consider becoming a LASSO teacher. We are anticipating a continuation
   of funding for the next fiscal year and will be soliciting applications
   from all teachers in New Mexico, southern Colorado, and west Texas
   beginning April 1, 2002. Two alternatives are available:
     * Click here to open a printable .pdf file of the application
       material.
     * Click here to download a Word (95-97 version) of the application

   Completed applications must be submitted to our office by May 17, 2002
   for consideration. Selected applicants will be notified by May 31,
   2002.
