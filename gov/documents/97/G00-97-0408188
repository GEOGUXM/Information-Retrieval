                                DOT Programs

    The Department of Transportation has a variety of on-going programs,
     carried out by different agencies. Many of these programs have some
   direct and some indirect beneficial impacts on greenhouse gas emissions
   and on other types of pollution from transportation. The links on this
   page lead to information on some of these programs, and describe their
                       relationship to climate change.
