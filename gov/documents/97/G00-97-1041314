   JPL Near-IR Laser Hygrometer for the
   ER-2, DC-8, and WB57F Aircraft

   Dr. Robert L. Herman (PI) and Dr. Randy D. May (consultant)

   The JPL Near-IR Laser Hyrometer is a new instrument for in-situ
   measurements of atmospheric water vapor from aircraft platforms such as
   the ER-2, the DC-8, and the WB57F aircraft. It is based upon near-IR
   tunable diode laser sources operating near 1.37 m m. These
   spectrometers feature open-path absorption cells [double-pass, or
   multipass (Herriott)]  for true in situ monitoring of H[2]O
   concentrations with precision levels exceeding those of Lyman-a and
   frost-point hygrometers. External sampling outside the aircraft
   boundary layer minimizes ambiguities. Measurement precision is Â± 0.05
   ppmv in the stratosphere for a 2 s measurement integration period. The
   flight-ready instrument weight is 18 lbs., and power consumption,
   exclusive of structural heaters, is 7.5 Watts.   The picture below
   shows the ER-2 instrument as mounted on the right-hand super pod for
   the POLARIS mission.  This same instrument was flown on the NASA WB57
   as part of WAM (WB57 Aerosol Mission) during April, 1998, and was
   mounted on an underwing hatch on the right wing of the aircraft.

   The DC-8 version of the laser hygrometer is shown here mounted on a
   window blank of the DC-8 at fuselage station 490 right.  The optical
   path is 50 cm and is a "there and back" double pass arrangement.  The
   upper blue housing holds the laser and detector, and the lower piece
   holds a single 0.5" diameter mirror for returning the beam to the
   detector.  Both the laser and detector are mounted on a single Al disk
   that is stabilized in temperature using a thermoelectric cooler (which
   actually operates as a heater most of the time during flights).

   This instrument is currently (Fall 1998) mounted on the DC-8 as part of
   the Convection and Moisture Experiment (CAMEX-3) where flights are
   underway from Patrick Air Force base near Cocoa Beach, Florida.
