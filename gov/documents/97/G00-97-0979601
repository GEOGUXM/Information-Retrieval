   Research

   My present research is centered around the ALS Infrared Beamlines.
   Together with many collaborators, we perferm a wide variety of research
   using this facility. Topics include Condensed Matter Physics, Cellular
   Biology, Environmental Science, Bioremediation, Forensic Studies,
   Chemistry, and Materials Science. My earlier research topics included
   fullerene materials, high-temperature superconductors, giant
   magnetoresistance oxides, and spin-Peierls compounds.

   I am the primary contact person for research at the IR beamlines. If
   you feel you may have a scientific problem for which the beamlines may
   be of help, please contact me. In addition to maintaining and upgrading
   beamline facilities, I am always available to help new users make the
   most of their infrared reaseach.

   Publications [bcover2.gif]

   I am an author of over 50 research articles (see my List of
   Publications) and one physics text book, Solid State Physics: Problems
   and Solutions by László Mihály and Michael C. Martin.

   Other Activities

   I created the award-winning travlang travel and language web pages. I
   also wrote and maintain all the IR beamline web pages.

   [bunnies42300.jpg] [6MonthSmiles.jpg] I enjoy skiing, volleyball,
   travel, and I am the proud father of twin daughters, Megan and Hannah,
   born 4-24-99.
