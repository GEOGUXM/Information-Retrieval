   Background
   Individuals planning to conduct any activity that may "take" (harass,
   harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect) a
   threatened or endangered species must possess a permit to perform that
   activity.  Section 10 of the ESA allows the National Marine Fisheries
   Service to issue permits for scientific purposes or to enhance the
   propagation or survival of listed species. "Section 10" permits may
   also be issued to entities engaging in lawful activities that may
   incidentally take a listed species.  To allow for processing time, and
   to ensure the timely issuance of a permit (should one be granted),
   individuals are urged to apply at least four months prior to the start
   of proposed activities.
     * Applications for Section 10 permits as well as Answers to
       Frequently Asked Questions about ESA permits are available online
       at the NMFS Office of Protected Resources.

   NOTE: NMFS Section 10 permits do NOT include fishing permits/licenses;
   these can be obtained from the following offices:
     * NMFS Fisheries Permits Office
     * California Department of Fish and Game
     * Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife
     * Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife
     * Idaho Department of Fish and Game

   CAPTION: Project Summaries for Pending Research Applications

   (1291) - U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) requests a permit for annual
   takes of juvenile Lower Columbia River chinook salmon and steelhead.
   Notice was published on February 21, 2001 (66 FR 11002) that the
   Columbia River Research Laboratory, USGS applied for a 5year scientific
   research permit (1291) for annual takes of ESA listed salmon and
   steelhead juveniles associated with a scientific research project at
   John Day, The Dalles, and Bonneville Dams on the lower Columbia River
   in the Pacific Northwest. The purpose of the research is to monitor
   juvenile fish movement, distribution, behavior, and survival from John
   Day Dam downstream past Bonneville Dam using radiotelemetry technology.
