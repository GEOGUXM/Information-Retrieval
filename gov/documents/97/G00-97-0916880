   (A text version of the Department's organization is also available.)

   About one third of the Department's 4900 employees are stationed in ten
   regional offices, making it easier to serve state and local educational
   systems. Regional staff are primarily involved in representing the
   Department's goals and views within the region, particularly in the
   areas of student financial assistance, civil rights enforcement,
   vocational rehabilitation services for the disabled, and Inspector
   General audits and investigations.
