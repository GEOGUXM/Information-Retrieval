   United States Court of Appeals FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT No.
   00-5212 September Term, 2000 98cv01232 98cv01233 United States of
   America, Filed On: October 18, 2000 [550906] Appellee v. Microsoft
   Corporation, Appellant ____________________________ Consolidated with
   00-5213 Before: Edwards, Chief Judge; Williams, Ginsburg, Sentelle,
   Randolph, Rogers, and Tatel, Circuit Judges NOTICE The parties are
   hereby advised that the Court is considering scheduling a review
   session on the fundamentals of automation to be conducted by Michael H.
   Hites, Ph.D., Chief Technology Officer at the Illinois Institute of
   Technology, on November 14, 2000. Dr. Hites, whose resume is attached,
   has no interest in this litigation. The review session would be
   descriptive only, focusing strictly on basic concepts underlying the
   fundamentals of automation; the review session would not address any of
   the issues presented in these appeals. In conjunction with the
   preparation of the review session, the Court would like for
   representatives of the parties to meet and confer with Dr. Hites to
   consult with respect to the outline of materials to be covered and the
   substantive content of both the lecture and supplemental materials. In
   addition, two representatives of each side, one counsel and one
   technical representative, would attend the review session and
   supplement Dr. Hites' presentation as appropriate. The parties are
   requested to respond to this proposal no later than 4:00 p.m.,
   Wednesday, October 25, 2000. FOR THE COURT: Mark J. Langer, Clerk
