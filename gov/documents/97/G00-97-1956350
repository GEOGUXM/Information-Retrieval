   Is mercury a significant contaminant in the Arctic?

                    Is the Arctic a missing sink for mercury?:
       New measurements of mercury speciation and depletion events at Point

      In the past decade many new sources of diffuse mercury emissions have
      been measured. These sources significantly increase the estimates of
      global mercury emissions, and suggest there may be missing mercury
      sinks in global models. Mercury levels in Arctic wildlife are elevated
      above normal levels, but there are few known Arctic mercury sources,
      and long range transport of mercury must be considered. The discovery
      of mercury depletion events (MDE, similar to ozone depletion) at Alert,
      NWT suggests a mechanism for mercury accumulation from the global pool.
      One hypothesis is that mercury is transformed into a reactive gaseous
      mercury (RGM) species which deposits locally. This species has never
      been measured in the Arctic, and MDE's must be confirmed at other
      Arctic sites.

         Steve Brooks of NOAA and Steve Lindberg of ORNL set up a denuder
     system [1] to measure atmospheric mercury speciation at the CMDL Point
                                              Barrow Observatory in Alaska.

      As part of the Barrow Arctic Mercury Study (BAMS), we have measured
      gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) at Barrow, AK since September, 1998
      with an automated Tekran analyzer [1]. The initial data provide the
      first confirmation of MDE's at this more southerly, Arctic site. MDE
      events begin soon after Polar sunrise, and persist until snowmelt.
      During MDE mercury exhibits a strong correlation with ozone, suggesting
      a link with the reactions that destroy tropospheric ozone. We have
      developed a simple model using local meteorological data which closely
      simulates the patterns of depletion events, and suggests that
      turbulence and temperature are important factors. There are a number of
      potential reaction pathways with mercury and bromine to explain the
      depletion events, which suggest that during these events mercury is
      oxidized to RGM. The model predicts a mercury deposition rate much
      higher than measured in the eastern US. To test our hypotheses, we are
      currently measuring RGM prior to and following polar sunrise during
      winter-spring 2000, and plan to measure mercury speciation and evasion
      in snowmelt during polar summer. The winter-spring 2000 RGM data are
      just now becoming available and represent the first confirmation of
      important rates of conversion of GEM to RGM in the Arctic. At Barrow we
      have recently measured some of the highest concetrations of RGM ever
      reported, including downwind of major point sources. To follow up on
      this important discovery, we are planning a major sampling campaign for
      next year: BAMS-2001 will include studies of reactive halogens and
      particulate mercury by Bob Stevens and Matt Landis of EPA-NERL, evasion
      from snowpack by Hong Zhang and George Sourhworth of ORNL, mercury
      dynamics in snow including studies of organic and bioavailable mercury
      by Karen Scott, John Rudd, and Carol Kelly of the University of
      Manitoba, and modeling of atmospheric reactions of mercury by Jerry Lin
      of Lamar University.

      [1] Researchers use a newly developed system to sample reactive gaseous
      mercury (RGM) in air. An annular denuder, developed by Tekran Inc. and
      the USEPA, is used to strip (denude) the reactive mercury gas species
      from the sampled air stream while allowing the non-reactive gaseous
      elemental mercury (GEM) species to pass through unsampled. The denuder
      is them heated to more than 500Â°C to desorb the RGM and convert it to
      GEM where it is detected by a Tekran GEM analyzer operating in the NOAA
      CMDL building.
