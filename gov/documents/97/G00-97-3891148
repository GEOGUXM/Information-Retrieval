   THE BUILDINGS

   [photo1.jpg]

   NEW U.S. COURTHOUSE
   The new Federal Courthouse will be located in the Civic Center of
   downtown Brooklyn, visible from the Brooklyn Bridge, the Manhattan
   Bridge, lower Manhattan and surrounding neighborhoods. It will be
   constructed on the site if the former Emanuel Cellar building was razed
   in 1998.
   The project is comprised of three architectural elements: the 6-story
   existing courthouse; a 6-story connecting entry hall, which includes
   the main building entrance, lobby and cross-building connectors; and
   the new courthouse, a 14-story, limestone-clad tower. The combined
   building elements will function as the new court complex.
   [photo2.jpg] The new $222 million building will ultimately house 16
   District courtrooms, nine Magistrate courtrooms and 29 judges'
   chambers. The building will open in 2002 with 12 District Courtrooms,
   for Magistrate courtrooms, one Arraignment courtroom and 17 judges'
   chambers. To provide for both current needs and beyond, areas to be
   occupied by future courtrooms and chambers will initially house the
   U.S. Probation Department, which will be relocated from the building,
   as additional court space is needed. The courtrooms and chambers are
   arranged in a collegial layout with a single chambers floor located
   between two court floors. This layout reduces the size if the
   floorplate, creating a more tapered building profile. The smaller
   Magistrate floors, located in the upper tower, allow the building to be
   setback at the top. The Courthouse will also house a U.S. Court of
   Appeals Library, offices for the District Court Clerk, the Pretrial
   Services Agency and the U.S. Marshals Service. The building will
   include a food service facility and a Jury Assembly area, as well a
   below ground parking.
   Designed by HLW International L.L.P and Cesar Pelli and Associates


      U.S. POST OFFICE AND COURTHOUSE
      [photo3.jpg] To renew its former commanding presence in the civic life
      of Brooklyn, approximately 85,000 square feet of space are being deftly
      inserted into the National Historic Landmark General Post Office, and
      the interior of the existing space will be completely renovated.
      Originally completed in 1892, and significantly expanded in 1933, this
      Romanesque Revival building will serve as a Federal Courthouse and Post
      Office. By building into portions of the interior courtyard of the1933
      addition, this $161 million project will provide a spacious new
      mezzanine, four new courtrooms on the second and third floors,
      and40,000 square feet of efficient office space on the upper floors
      that will house the U.S. Attorney's office. The U.S. Postal Service
      will occupy newly renovated space in order to continue to provide
      retail sales of postal products and mail delivery service to the
      downtown community.
      [photo4.jpg] Significant historic elements are being restored while new
      elements are being carefully integrated into the historic fabric to
      introduce maximum natural light. Original wood and marble are being
      cleaned and restored and original paint colors and patterns are being
      replicated. To determine the original paint colors, successive layers
      of paint are being removed in a series of test "windows" until the
      original surf-ace is revealed. A new monumental flight of steps, scaled
      to the existing building and overlooking a block-long public park, will
      connect the building's three entrances to the street.
      Designed by R.M. Kliment & Frances Halsband Architects
