                                ATP Funding Guidelines on
                              Research Involving Stem Cells


         The NIST Advanced Technology Program (ATP) adheres to all Presidential
         policies, statutes, guidelines and regulations regarding the use of
         human embryonic stem cells. Until further direction has been provided
         for the use of federal funds involving human embryonic stem cell
         research and NIST has had the opportunity to fully assess such
         direction and develop implementing procedures, ATP will not consider
         new proposals that involve the use of human embryonic stem cells, or
         the use of human embryonic stem cells in existing proposals.
