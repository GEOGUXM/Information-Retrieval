                          Avalanche Weather Briefer
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Avalanche Weather Briefer has been formulated to aid in
   interpretation of the NWAC Mountain Weather Forecast Product, as well
   as understanding weather in general.  If a picture is worth a thousand
   words, then these images should assist users in understanding and
   better utilizing  the forecasts.  The Briefer has been created with the
   cooperation of the National Weather Service, Seattle, and links to a
   variety of governmental and other weather web sites.  Please be aware
   that in order to run the loops correctly, the Briefer must be viewed
   with Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, Version 4.0 or greater. A
   short summary and explanation of the various products in the briefer
   follows.

   Time conventions--When viewing either the images or forecast model
   charts, unless otherwise indicated, the times listed are in Universal
   Time (Greenwich Mean Time, UT, Z-time etc.).  These times are 8 hours
   ahead of PST (Pacific standard) local time, or 7 hours ahead of PDT
   (daylight savings time).  For example, 00Z Wednesday = 4 PM Tuesday,
   and 12Z Wednesday = 4 AM Wednesday, etc. The satellite (visible and IR)
   and radar images are scheduled to automatically update every hour,
   while the other products are scheduled to automatically update whenever
   new products arrive.

   Available Products-List of Available products in this Avalanche/Weather
   Briefer

   Latest 500 mb Height and Vorticity--Latest available analysis (either
   0Z or 12Z) from the Aviation model. This overlays the 500 mb pressure
   level height chart from 00Z of the date indicated with the vorticity (a
   measure of horizontal shear at the 500mb level). In general, positive
   vorticity produces upward vertical motion and enhances storm
   development, while negative vorticity produces downward motion and
   results in weakening storm activity or decreasing clouds.  This is an
   excellent way to visualize general atmospheric circulations and relate
   them to wind flow at the 500 mb (about 18,000 feet or 5500 meters)
   level.  This chart may be compared with the water vapor image shown
   below to help visualize both small and large scale circulations. Winds
   at this level blow approximately parallel to the contour lines of the
   chart, with the lines showing height of the 500 mb pressure surface
   above mean sea level (in tens of meter).

   Display of 500 mb Heights and Vorticity--Latest available 0-72 hour
   display of the Aviation (AVN) forecast model for 500 mb heights and
   vorticity.  This model is output twice/day at 0Z and 12Z UT and is
   courtesy of the IGES (Institute of Global Environment and Society)

   Current or Latest Surface Pressure (from the MM5 model)-- shows the
   current  surface pressure pattern over the Northwest from the 12km
   domain of the MM5 model, courtesy of the University of Washington and
   the MM5 consortium.  In the absence of terrain, winds normally blow at
   an angle across lines of equal sea level pressure toward low pressure,
   the actual angle depending on frictional effects and other factors.
   However, when terrain is introduced, winds may blow directly across
   isobars--for example winds may be channeled either east or west through
   Cascade mountain passes, blowing from high pressure toward low pressure
   (like when the air is released from a balloon).

   Forecast Mean Sea Level Pressure and Precipitation-- shows a 72 hour
   animation/time loop of mean sea level pressure overlayed with model
   ouput precipitation (12-hour values)--from the Aviation (AVN) model.
   Similar information (but with 1000-500mb thicknesses instead of
   precipitation) is also available as a series of charts arranged
   vertically. In the absence of terrain, winds normally blow at an angle
   across lines of equal sea level pressure toward low pressure, the
   actual angle depending on frictional effects and other factors.
   However, when terrain is introduced, winds may blow directly across
   isobars--for example winds may be channeled either east or west through
   Cascade mountain passes, blowing from high pressure toward low pressure
   (like when the air is released from a balloon). A 10-day sea level
   pressure and precipitation loop is also available.

   1km Visible Image--Latest available 1 kilometer resolution visible
   image of the atmosphere over the Northwest.  View taken from the
   GOES-10 (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite).

   4 km Visible Loop--Latest 4 kilometer resolution visible image loop of
   the atmosphere over the Northwest.  View taken from the GOES-10
   (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite).  Please be
   patient--may take a while to load.

   4 km IR Loop --Latest available enhanced infrared image loop for the
   region centered around the Pacific Northwest and just offshore. Please
   be patient--may take a while to load.

   4 km Visible Loop --Latest available enhanced infrared image loop for
   the region centered around the Pacific Northwest and just offshore.
   Please be patient--may take a while to load.

   Northwest Radar Image--Latest available composite NEXRAD Weather Radar
   image for the Northwest region (courtesy WSI).

   Seattle Radar Image--Latest available composite NEXRAD Weather Radar
   image for the Northwest (courtesy WSI).

   Soundings--Latest available vertical atmospheric temperature, moisture
   and wind soundings from Salem, Oregon and Forks (Quillayute)
   Washington.

   Time Loops of latest available 850mb &  700mb  Heights--Time loops of
   weather forecast charts showing evolution of 850 mb (approximately 5000
   ft/1500 meter) and 700 mb (~10,000 ft/3000 m) pressure level heights
   (in meters), temperature (850mb)  or relative humidity (700mb) and wind
   barbs for the next 72 hours.  Spacing of these isopleths (lines of
   constant height) correlates closely to strength of winds while
   orientation of the lines indicates approximate wind direction (winds
   blow along or approximately parallel to these lines except where the
   pressure levels intersect higher terrain).  In these displays from the
   Aviation Forecast Model, the 850 mb heights are also displayed with
   Temperature and Winds and the 700 mb heights are displayed along with
   Relative Humidity and Winds.

   6-10 Day Outlook for Temperature & Precipitation--Latest available
   forecast charts showing statistical probabilities of precipitation and
   temperature for the 6-10 day forecast period indicated, as compared to
   climatological normals

   30-90 day Outlook--Latest available forecast charts showing statistical
   probabilities of precipitation and temperature for the 30 and 90 day
   periods indicated, as compared to climatological normals.

   University of Michigan,  the National Weather Service Forecast Office
   in Seattle, or by the Northwest Weather and Avalanche Center.
