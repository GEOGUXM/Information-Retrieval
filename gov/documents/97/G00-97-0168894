     Figure 1: Extent of airborne scanning laser (lidar) surveys along the
      west coast of the United States during October 1997 and April 1998.

   During late summer 1997, NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, NOAA's Coastal
   Services Center, and the USGS Coastal & Marine Program formulated a
   plan to determine the magnitude, spatial patterns, and causative
   processes of El Niño-induced change along the west coast of the United
   States. A key element of the plan was to survey 1200 km of
   representative reaches of the west coast both prior to and following
   the El Niño winter storms using scanning airborne laser altimetry, a
   technology which has only recently been applied to coastal change
   research.

   Research Plan

   A plan was formulated to address the following questions:
     * What were the magnitudes and spatial patterns of beach and coastal
       cliff changes along representative reaches characteristic of the
       entire west coast of the United States? How were these magnitudes
       and patterns different than what normally occurs during non-El Niño
       winters?
     * To what extent were elevated sea levels responsible for beach
       changes and ultimately cliff erosion?
     * To what extent were the observed beach and cliff changes a result
       of changes in the wave climate during El Niño years?

   To provide magnitudes and spatial patterns of beach and coastal cliff
   response to the El Niño storms, NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper
   (ATM) was used to survey three reaches of coast in October 1997, prior
   to the onset of the El Niño storms, and again in April 1998,
   immediately following the winter season. (Fig. 1)

   NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper

   The ATM can survey beach topography along hundreds of kilometers of
   coast in a single day with data densities that cannot be achieved with
   traditional survey technologies (Fig. 2 ). For each pass along the
   coast, the ATM lidar scanned a 375 m wide swath along the aircraft
   flight line. For most of the study area, four overlapping passes were
   flown yielding a typical surveyed swath ~700 m wide with laser spot
   elevations every 3 m^2. The aircraft pitch, roll, and heading were
   obtained with an inertial navigation system and the positioning of the
   aircraft was determined using kinematic Global Positioning System (GPS)
   techniques. The twin-engine turboprop aircraft, a De Havilland Twin
   Otter, was provided and operated by NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center,
   McDill Air Force Base, Tampa, FL.

   Hampton, USGS).

   Initial Results

   Sea cliffs in the Pacifica, CA area (Fig. 1) were severely impacted
   during the El Niño winter, threatening a number of homes. The local
   topography of the area was derived from ATM data acquired in October
   1997 prior to the onset of the winter storms (Fig. 3A). Note the sea
   cliff which ranges from greater than 35 m high in the north near Mussel
   Rock to about 15 m high in the central part of the map. Adjacent to the
   cliff, the lidar data show the shape and dimensions of houses and
   buildings (Fig. 3B). Pacifica is the area which attracted a great deal
   of media interest during the winter of 1997-98 as the houses on the
   brink of the cliff (shown in Fig. 3B) were threatened by erosion.
   Ultimately, 12 houses were condemned as unsafe and seven were razed
   before they were claimed by the sea.

   At the camera location (indicated on Fig. 3B), oblique photographs were
   taken prior to and after a series of severe winter storms in early 1998
   (Figs. 3C & D). Comparison of the photographs clearly shows evidence of
   landward retreat of the cliff which is composed of loosely consolidated
   sands and gravel.

       derived from lidar data of October 1997 and April 1998 of the cliff
   area near Pacifica. Each profile shows individual laser spot elevations
     that fall within a 2m wide strip oriented approximately shore normal.
   A. Example profiles showing erosion of the sea cliff and adjacent beach
           located at the southern profile location in Fig. 3B. B. Example
        profiles showing a stable cliff and accreting beach located at the
                                     northern profile location in Fig. 3B.

   Beach and cliff changes are quantitatively shown by comparing
   cross-shore profiles consisting of individual laser spot elevations
   (Fig. 4A & B). Locations of these profiles are shown in respect to
   lidar topography in Figure 3B. First note that in comparing pre- and
   post-El Niño surveys, profiles over homes and buildings are very close
   in shape and position. This provides visual confirmation that the ATM
   lidar data is sufficiently accurate to resolve the magnitudes of beach
   and cliff changes observed here. In Figure 4A, about 100 m north of the
   camera location, the crest of the cliff retreated 13 m landward while
   the toe of the cliff retreated about 10 m. Interestingly, the long term
   average erosion rate for cliffs in this general area is roughly .2
   m/year (Lajoie & Mathieson, 1985). Hence, the 1997-98 El Niño accounted
   for about 50 years of cliff erosion at this location. However, along
   the coast, the cliff did not retreat landward uniformly; in fact, there
   was considerable spatial variability in the responses of both beaches
   and cliffs. For example, consider the stable cliff in Fig. 4B which was
   located only several hundred meters north of the eroding cliff (Fig.
   4A). Further, the beach below the stable cliff accreted during the El
   Niño winter about 2 m vertically. In contrast, the beach below the
   eroding cliff eroded about 2 m vertically. These dramatic spatial
   changes in response may be similar to what Komar (1985) visually
   observed during 1982-83 El Niño on Oregon pocket beaches. The more
   southerly wave approach during an El Niño winter may have transported
   sand from the southern profile to the northern location protecting the
   more northerly cliffs from wave erosion.
