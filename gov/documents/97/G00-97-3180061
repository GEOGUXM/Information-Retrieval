   In the summer of 1989, NASA's Voyager 2 became the first spacecraft to
   observe the planet Neptune, its final planetary target. Passing about
   4,950 kilometers (3,000 miles) above Neptune's north pole, Voyager 2
   made its closest approach to any planet since leaving Earth 12 years
   agao. Five hours later, Voyager 2 passed about 40,000 kilometers
   (25,000 miles) from Neptune's largest moon, Triton, the last solid body
   the spacecraft will have an opportunity to study.
