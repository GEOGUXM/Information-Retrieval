                               AFSC Databases

   Databases on fishery, oceanography, marine mammal, and environmental
   research compiled by Alaska Center scientists are used to develop
   policies and strategies for fisheries management within the U.S.
   Exclusive Economic Zone, to monitor and manage the health of the
   region's marine mammal populations, and to assess the impacts of
   chemical contaminants and physical alterations on select organisms and
   marine habitats. The data, some dating back nearly 100 years, are
   obtained from boat surveys, aerial surveys, land counts, stream and
   beach surveys, and other miscellaneous sources. These databases are
   available for downloading from the AFSC website or from database
   managers at the Alaska Center.
   We ask that  users contact the Alaska Fisheries Science Center before
   using these data in publications and that any errors be reported. Users
   should note that the databases are continually updated and modified.
   Please check for date of last modification.
