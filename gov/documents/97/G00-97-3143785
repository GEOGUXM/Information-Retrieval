   Strandings occur when marine mammals or sea turtles swim or float into
   shore and become "beached" or stuck in shallow water. In 1999 alone,
   more than 3000 marine mammals stranded on U.S. shores. In most
   stranding cases, the cause of the stranding is unknown, but some
   identified causes have included disease, parasite infestation, harmful
   algal blooms, injuries due to ship strikes or fishery entanglements,
   pollution exposure, trauma, and starvation. While the majority of
   stranded animals are found dead, some animals strand alive and in a
   limited number of cases it is possible to transport these individuals
   to regional rehabilitation centers for care.  In rare cases,
   successfully rehabilitated animals are returned to the wild.
