   1999, the Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML) made major
   advances in the development and deployment of radiological field
   characterization and monitoring technologies. Highlights included the
   development and demonstration of PASS, a portable aerosol sampling
   system to be deployed at the Fernald Environmental Management Project
   (FEMP). Also, EML continued its efforts to have in situ gamma-ray
   spectrometry accepted by industry as a high quality measurement tech-
   nique that can be used in place of, or in conjunction with, traditional
   soil sampling and laboratory-based analytical methods. These real-time
   measurements at FEMP are projected to save more than 30 million dollars
   in measurements costs and will help the 2006 Closure Schedule to
   proceed without delays due to analytical overload. In our role as a
   federal technical lead, EML supports EM's site cleanup and closure
   activities by providing an unbiased and responsive technical capability
   to assure quality in sampling, measurements and analyses, and risk
   assessments. Highlights of our FY 1999 successes in this area include
   EML's participation in two technology deployment programs, the Brook-
   haven National Laboratory's Peconic River plutonium contamination
   study, and the West Valley closure engineering work. In addition, EML
   is leading the Center for Risk Excellence's efforts in modifying the
   Cleanup Criteria Decision Document. EML has also been designated as a
   reference labora- tory for the DOE Radiological Traceability Program.
   Of special note, an EML scientist received Vice President Gore's Hammer
   Award for participating on the Multi-Ag e n cy Radiation Survey and
   Site Investigation Manual ( M A RS S I M ) Work Group. In our mission
   to provide DOE and other federal agencies with an in- house,
   high-quality scientific capability to address important issues related
   to national security such as nonproliferation, EML has been named as
   the U.S. Radionuclide Laboratory for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
   Treaty (CTBT). I n c o n t i n u i n g m o re t h a n 50 ye a rs o f a
   t ra d i t i o n o f exc e l l e n c e, E M L i n F Y 19 9 9 achieved
   great successes for our customers, and we will strive to continue to be
   a unique and vital federal resource into the next millennium. Mitchell
   D. Erickson, Director 1 O VERVIEW The Environmental Measurements
   Laboratory (EML) is a federal technical resource with a distinguished
   50-year reputation in low-level environmental radiation and
   radioactivity measurements. It is government-owned, govern-
   ment-operated, reporting programmatically to the Office of
   Environmental Management, and administratively to the Chicago
   Operations Office. M ISSION Conducts scientific investigations and
   develops technologies related to environmental restoration, site and
   facility charac- terization, and environmental surveillance and
   monitoring. Provides DOE and other federal agencies with an unbiased
   and responsive technical capability to assure quality in sampling,
   measurements and analyses, and risk assessments of human exposure to
   radioactivity and other energy-related pollutants. Provides DOE and
   other federal agencies with an in-house, high-quality scientific
   capability to address important issues related to national security
   such as nonproliferation. S TRATEGY EML serves a broad range of federal
   customers, primarily in DOE, but also across agencies that require
   applied research and operational capabilities in environmental
   measurements, quality assurance, and contaminant detec- tion
   technologies. EML's primary near-term strategy for fulfilling its
   mission is to continue its development of technologies, measurement
   systems and software, to seek partnerships with DOE field offices for
   deployment oppor- tunities, and to provide quality assurance and
   management support. EML's FY 1999 federal customers included: DOE
   Office of Environmental Manage- ment (EM), DOE Office of Science (SC),
   DOE Office of Nonpro l i f e ration and National Security (NN), the Air
   Fo rce (AF), Defense Threat Reduction Ag e n cy ( DT R A), E n v i ro n
   m e n t a l P ro t e c t i o n Ag e n cy ( E PA ) , N u c l e a r Re g
   u l a t o r y C o m m i s- sion (NRC), and the National Ae ronautics
   and Space Ad m i n i s t ration (NASA ) . 2 Aside from the various
   principal customers and facilities specified in this report, EML also
   provides expert technical advice on environmental radia- tion and
   radioactivity to many other DOE sites, other U.S. gove r n m e n t a g
   e n c i e s, international org a n i z a t i o n s, and the private
   sector. This assistance reflects the ove rall larger role the
   Laboratory plays as a federal technical resource in sharing its
   knowledge and experience and promoting efficiency of operations
   throughout the nation and the world. Examples of those a s s i s t e d

   INVESTIGATIONS AND DEVELOPS TECHNOLOGIES RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL C
   RESTORATION,SITE AND FACILITY CHARACTERIZATION, AND ENVIRONMENTAL
   SURVEILLANCE AND MONITORING EML supports EM cleanup and closure
   activities m e a s u rement technology. EML is especially at DOE sites
   by developing, demonstrating and i n vo l ved in Deactivation and
   Decommissioning d e p l oying advanced radiological measure m e n t
   (D&D) activities throughout the DOE complex and survey methods and
   instruments; by assist- with projects including: in situ g a m m a -
   ray spec- ing in the collection, interpretation, and modeling t ro m e
   t r y, accelerated site technology deploy m e n t of ra d i o a c t i
   ve contaminant data in special low - p ro j e c t s, and innova t i ve
   data interpretation tech- l evel (at or near backg round) situations;
   and niques for "hot spot" assessments. The follow i n g by insuring the
   ove rall quality, cost effective - a re highlights of these D&D and
   other scientific ness and industry acceptance of field ra d i a t i o n
   accomplishments for FY 1999. IN SITU GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY
   DEVELOPMENTS EM, EPA To help reduce the costs and time associated with
   the environmental cleanup taking place within the DOE complex requires
   innovative measurement tech- niques of radioactive contaminants during
   site characterization work as well as certifica- tion of areas
   following remediation. In situ gamma-ray spectrometry is a technique
   that provides information on the concentrations for specific
   radionuclides that are present in soil and building materials. As the
   leading developer of this technique, EML contin- ued its efforts to
   have in situ gamma-ray spectrometry accepted by industry as a high
   quality measurement technique that can be used in place of, or in
   conjunction with, traditional soil sampling and laboratory-based
   analytical methods. Technical inquiries and guidance were provided to
   DOE sites, manufacturers, regulators and other government agencies. In
   particu- lar, EML partnered with EPA to demon- strate in situ gamma-ray
   spectrometry techniques at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The U.S. Army
   is anticipating using this technique to address depleted uranium
   contamination at DoD facilities and is interested in a cooperative
   effort with EML and EPA. ACCELERATED SITE TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT (ASTD)
   EM EML has partnered with the Fernald Environmental Management Project
   (FEMP) and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) on two ASTD projects:
   FEMP Activities continued with FEMP on "Deployment of an Integrated
   Technology Suite for Cost- iiiEffectively Delineating Contamination in
   Soils in Support of Soil Remedial Actions" at the Ohio Field i i
   Office. This project supports EM's Office of Science and Technology
   (OST) Subsurface Contaminants Focus Area (SCFA). In situ gamma-ray
   spectrometry is deployed at FEMP for characterization, excavation
   control and precertification activities. BN L The ASTD project with
   BNL, "Deployment of Innovative Characterization Technologies and
   TiiImplementation of the MARSSIM Process at Radiologically Contaminated
   Sites," supports OST's iiiDeactivation and Decommissioning Focus Area
   (DDFA). EML's role involves the application of MARSSIM (Multi-Agency
   Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual) methodology for radio-
   logical surveys and in situ gamma-ray spectrometry to stabilize and
   decommission the Brookhaven iGraphite Research Reactor (BGRR). 4 "HOT
   SPOT" ASSESSMENT EM EML has advanced the state of the art in
   interpreting in situ gamma-ray spectrom- etry results with the
   development of a deconvolution method for closely spaced measurements.
   Both smooth distributions and potential "hot spots" of gamma- emitting
   radionuclides can be mapped with this technique. The deconvolution code
   was also modified to allow for the inclusion of soil sample data in
   conjunction with in situ gamma-ray results. The code was demonstrated
   at the Aberdeen Proving Ground for the detection of depleted uranium.
   AEROSOL MEASUREMENTS COMPARABILITY STUDIES EM To better quantify the
   air component of the dose to the population in the FEMP area, EML set
   up specialized aerosol sampling equipment at FEMP's fence line. For the
   past year, the equipment has been co-located with a high volume sampler
   to establish comparability of the samplers. The data obtained during FY
   1999 indicate that the particle size distribution of uranium and
   thorium bearing aerosols must be considered to better improve the
   calculations of the dose to the popu- lation from Fernald's activities.
   PORTABLE AEROSOL SAMPLING SYSTEM (PASS) EM To meet the needs of Fernald
   in dose studies, EML designed, engineered and successfully completed a
   one-year demon- stration of a sampler to make size distribution
   measurements for remote sampling at FEMP. PASS is lightweight, has a
   low air flow, uses low d. c. power, and is automated for the col-
   lection of uranium bearing ambient aerosols. PASS is success- fully
   operating at the fence line of FEMP and at Miamitown, Ohio, the upwind
   site from FEMP. 5 CESIUM 2K ANALYZER EM EML has begun the development
   of a Cesium 2K Analyzer. The objective of this project is to develop an
   inexpen- sive, lightweight, portable field instrument to measure 137Cs
   that has been collected on 3MTM Empore Disks. The design of this
   analyzer is based on a microcomputer which will make it easy to use,
   while keeping the cost below $2000, which is one-fifth the cost of
   using a more conventional multichannel analyzer approach. Once
   developed, the Cesium 2K analyzers will be used for monitoring D&D
   operations at DOE sites. RADON INSTRUMENTATION EM A considerable
   inventory of radium and compounds exists in contaminated soils and
   facilities across the DOE complex. As a decay product of radium, radon
   forms an essential component of the monitoring needs for DOE. EML is
   applying its expertise in radon and radon progeny measurements to
   assist the FEMP in data interpretation near the K-65 silos. Among EML's
   most successful technology development activities in its 50-year
   history are various radon instrumentation innovations and engineering
   designs. In FY 1999, several radon monitor and sensor technologies were
   deployed at various sites, are ready for implementation, or are in
   various stages of development (see also the section on the Radometer in
   the CTBT section). AT M O S P H E R I CM O N I TO R S E M L'sn e a rre
   a l - t i m e 2 22Rn atmospheric monitors have been deployed at the
   Mauna Loa Observatory (a regional baseline station of the National
   Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Climate Monitoring
   and Diagnostics Laboratory) and the Atmospheric/Ocean Chemistry
   Experiment (AEROCE) Station at Tudor Hill, Bermuda. These monitors have
   provided a unique source of reliable 2 22Rn data to the scientific
   community since 1990. Researchers use the data to help determine air
   mass provenance and the timing of events transporting air that has been
   in contact with a landmass to the oceanic measurement sites.
   Additionally, atmospheric modelers use these rare databases, available
   on the EML Web Site, to test and validate the transport component of
   general circulation models. In FY 1999, a 2 22Rn monitor, deployed at
   the Finland Global Atmosphere Watch Station in Pallas (as part of a
   collabora- tion with the Finnish Meteorological Institute) continues to
   p rov i d e c r i t i c a l d a t a f o r d e t e r m i n i n g a i r m
   a s s t ra n s p o r t eve n t s. BARREL RADOMETER EML has designed,
   built a prototype, and is now testing the Barrel Radometer instrument
   to replace the much larger atmospheric monitors. Although the entire
   instrument and support electronics are contained in a weatherproof 50
   gallon drum, the Barrel Radometer has a 2 22Rn sensitivity comparable
   to the atmospheric monitors. EML has been collaborating with Advanced
   Power Technology, Inc. to strategize the com- mercialization of the
   Barrel Radometer. 6 NEUTRON SPECTROMETRY NASA EML has been doing re s e
   a rch in neutro n s p e c t rometry (measuring the energy distribution
   of neutron radiation) for over 30 ye a rs. N e u t ro n s p e c t
   rometry is essential for understanding the risks to human health caused
   by neutro n ra d i a t i o n . To determine doses from cosmic
   radiation, especially neutro n s, to occupants of high-altitude airc
   raft, EML and the NASA Langley Re s e a rch Center (LaRC) started the
   Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation (AIR) Measurements P roject, with an EML
   scientist as the Principal Inve s t i g a t o r. The AIR Project is an
   international collaboration of 12 laboratories that placed 14
   instruments on multiple flights of a NASA ER-2 high-altitude airc raft.
   The primary instrument is the EML high-energy multi-sphere neutron
   spectrometer (HEMNS). In FY 1999, work concentrated on accurately
   determining the response of the EML HEMNS and deve l o p i n g a d
   vanced spectrum analysis methods. Improved response calculations we re
   begun using the new Los Alamos h i g h - e n e rgy radiation transport
   code MCNPX. Scientists and engineers from EML, the Los Alamos Neutron
   Science Center (LANSCE), and LaRC performed an experiment at LANSCE to
   measure the response of the EML HEMNS to a known spectrum of
   high-energy neutrons in an energy region where calculations of the
   response have larg e u n c e r t a i n t i e s. EML is planning to
   apply the spectrometry capabilities developed in this project to
   neutron measurement needs for assessing enviro n m e n t a l - l evel
   doses at DOE's high energy accelera t o rs and for advancing detection
   methods in support of nonpro l i f e ration activities. GROUNDWATER
   MODELING EM EML is utilizing a state-of-the-art three-dimensional
   groundwater model to examine and predict the transport of uranium
   contamination at Fernald, Ohio for the FEMP. During FY 1999, an
   advanced graphical data visualization technique was developed in
   collaboration with IBM. The technique was used to perform model
   simulations and to analyze and display the complex three-dimensional
   model results and observations of the contamination surrounding FEMP.
   EML's work will improve the current FEMP groundwater model for cleanup
   of FEMP's groundwater plumes by helping to determine the minimum number
   of conventional extraction wells necessary to restore the sole source
   residential drinking water aquifer for FEMP within a reasonable time
   frame. 7 ROVIDES DOE AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES WITH AN UNBIASED AND

   EXPOSURE TO RADIOACTIVITY AND OTHER ENERGY- R E L ATED POLLUTA N T S E
   M L's long-standing reputation for exc e l- relate to the assessment of
   radiation and lence in environmental measurements has radioactivity in
   the environment. Projects led to its being called upon for assistance
   of this nature, highlights of which are dis- and consultation by
   numerous org a n i z a t i o n s cussed below, are a natural extension
   of the in the U.S. and around the world. The s t a f f 's collective
   expertise and are in ke e p i n g L a b o ratory fulfills special needs
   within the with a larger role that a specialized labora t o- scientific
   community outside of DOE that ry such as EML plays within the DOE
   family. ANNOUNCEMENT OF PARTNERING AGREEMENT Stan Morton, Director,
   NAMP, and Mitchell D. Erickson, Director, EML, announced a Memorandum
   of Agreement with the Office of Site Operations, the Office of Science
   and Technology, NAMP and EML to promote quality in the planning,
   management, and performance of radioanalytical characterization and
   monitoring data collection activities in support of DOE's environmental
   quality initiatives. The National Analytical Management Pro g ram
   (NAMP) objectives are to assure EM cre d i b l e, cost-effective data
   for environmental decision making and compliance. EML supports NAMP
   through the following activ- ities: Quality Assessment Pro g ram (QAP),
   development of quality control materials, gamma spectro m e t r y data
   evaluation, methods development and validation, traceability
   activities, and intera g e n cy collabora t i o n and re p resentation
   on standards committees and work groups concerned with laboratory data
   quality or validation of new ra d i o a s s ay methods. NIST
   TRACEABILITY EM NAMP, under its mission to provide scientific support
   to EM for the quality of its radiological data, has estab- lished the
   DOE Radiological Traceability Program (RTP). EML, because of its unique
   capabilities in the detection and quantification of radioactivity and
   in the preparation of radioassay testing materials, has been designated
   as a Reference Laboratory for the RTP. RTP will enable laboratories
   that perform analytical radiological testing for EM to establish
   traceability to the National Institute of Standards and Technology
   (NIST), the U.S. national standard for radioanalytical measurements. 8
   QUALITY ASSESSMENT PROGRAM EM E M L's QAP is an external, independent
   performance-based eva l u a t i o n p ro g ram designed to test the
   quality of environmental ra d i o l o g i c a l m e a s u rements
   reported by DOE contractor and subcontractor labora- t o r i e s. The
   pro g ram provides EM with complex-wide comparability of e n v i
   ronmental radiological analyses for characterization, site survey and
   monitoring activities. In FY 1999, there we re 173 national and
   international participants. Participation of EM contra c t o rs is re q
   u i re d by DOE Secretarial Memorandum (March 1993). A summary of the
   evaluation of reported re s u l t s, issued in January and July, is ava
   i l a b l e to the participants 48 hours after the reporting deadline
   via the EML Web Site. This rapid access to the data is a unique
   feature. As part of the QA P, EML provides quality control materials
   for corre c t i ve a c t i o n s, methods evaluation and batch control
   as requested by the participating labora t o r i e s. AU TO M ATED
   MICROPIPETTE S Y S T E M An automated micropipette system, designed at
   EML to spike filter samples for the QAP pro g ram, delive rs a highly
   accurate volume of solution in a p ro g rammable pattern. EML has
   fabricated this device for other customers. A similar system was
   fabricated and deployed for the International Atomic Energy Ag e n cy.
   GAMMA SPECTRO M E T RY DATA EVA L UATION PRO G R A M EML continued its
   Gamma Spectrometry Data Evaluation Pro g ram to provide DOE with an
   assessment of the participating laboratories and contra c t o rs in
   their performance of g a m m a - ray spectra analyses re q u i red for
   EM projects and site chara c t e r i z a t i o n s. This is a voluntary
   pro g ram designed to test the ability of the gamma spectroscopist to
   accura t e l y identify and quantify nuclides in both routine and more
   complicated analyses using sy n- thetic spectra. The pro g ram provides
   laboratories with analysis problems that are difficult to create with
   natural matrix or spike samples and helps participants determine if
   there a re problems in their data reduction softwa re. EML PROCEDURES
   MANUA L ( H A S L - 3 0 0 ) The 28th Edition of HASL-300, originally
   issued in 1957, p rovides a world re n owned re s o u rce for
   analytical pro c e d u res and methods. The Manual is continually
   updated via E M L's Web Site. In FY 1999, three new methods we re
   added: "P re p a ration of M i c ro p recipitation Sources for Re a n a
   l ys i s," " I ron in Aqueous Samples-Dual-DP Mode Liquid Scintillation
   Analys i s," and "Technetium-99 in Wa t er-T E VA Re s i n." 9
   ENVIRONMENTAL TEST CHAMBER EM,NN EML's Environmental Chamber is a user
   facility with unique capabilities for generating con- trolled
   atmospheres with aerosols and radio- active gases. It is capable of
   maintaining a great range of a combination of environmental aerosol and
   radioactive aerosol parameters, and is ideally suited for the creation
   of a wide variety of regimes for sophisticated experi- ments and
   instrumental calibration and testing. Since the EML Environmental
   Chamber is the only facility in North America capable of measuring
   radon and thoron mixtures over a range of environmental and aerosol
   conditions, FEMP requested in FY 1999 that EML calibrate instruments
   used to monitor airborne alpha radioactivity in areas formerly used to
   process uranium and thorium. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO DOE HEADQUARTERS
   EM,SC EML supports EM and SC Headquarters by fulfilling important
   programmatic functions and responsibili- ties. As federal technical
   experts, the EML staff not only fulfills administrative roles, but more
   importantly provides technical direction for several programs. In these
   roles, EML adds value to these programs, high- lights of which are
   described below. CH A R AC T E R I Z AT I O N ,M O N I TORING AND
   SENSOR T E C H N O L O G Y ( C M S T ) : EML provides programmatic and
   technical support for the CMST activities. EML contributes its
   technical expertise by assessing proposals, monitoring project
   progress, evaluating project products, and assessing technology
   requirements, capabilities and limi- tations. During FY 1999 EML held
   functional responsibilities as Product Line Manager for DDFA and as
   project facilitators. EML also directly responded to requests for
   technical reviews and assistance. JOINT COORDINATING COMMITTEE ON
   ENVIRO N M E N TAL M A N AGEMENT (JCCEM): EML represents EM/OST as the
   Technical Program Manager for the Site Characterization and Contaminant
   Transport Focus Area of the JCCEM cooperative projects. The JCCEM is
   the managing body of a Memorandum of Cooperation between DOE/OST and
   the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (MINATOM). The JCCEM Russian and
   American scientists collabora t i vely study contaminant migration in
   gro u n d- wa t e r, especially using the historical data and expertise
   associated with the Ru s s i a n 10 nuclear production sites at Mayak,
   Tomsk and Kra s n oya rsk and applying their use to DOE sites. The
   Technical Pro g ram Manager is responsible for ensuring that the
   techni- cal direction and execution of the pro g ram are beneficial to
   the EM cleanup activities ongoing at DOE sites. During FY 1999, this
   JCCEM pro g ram re c e i ved commitment from the Pro g ram Manager for
   the Ground Wa t e r / Vadose Zone Integration Project and fro m the DOE
   Richland (DOE-RL) Hanford Sitewide Modeling Pro g ram Manager on the
   applicability of JCCEM modeling of Russian waste sites for addressing
   contaminant m i g ration and waste management issues at Hanford . HUMAN
   SUBJECTS RESEARCH PRO G R A M As part of the SC Office of Biological
   and Environmental Research (OBER) Human Subjects Research Program, the
   Human Subjects Research Database (HSRD) documents all research
   involving the use of human subjects that is currently funded by DOE,
   occurs at DOE facilities, is performed by DOE personnel or relates to
   DOE activities in compliance with Federal Policy for the Protection of
   Human Subjects (10 CFR 745). The HSRD was initiated in response to the
   Secretary of Energy's Openness Initiative (1994). EML performs the
   administrative and tech- nical tasks associated with managing the HSRD.
   EML is responsible for creating, annually updating, maintaining and
   ensuring the quality of the database. EML also provides software
   development and participates in the Human Subjects Working Group. To
   make this informa- tion readily available to the public, the FY 1999
   database can be accessed through OBER's Web Site
   (www.er.doe.gov/production/ober/humsubj/index.html). ST R ATEGIC ENVIRO
   N M E N TAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT P ROGRAM (SERDP): SERDP
   identifies, develops, and transitions environmental technologies that
   relate directly to defense mission accomplishments. In FY 1999, EML
   con- tinued its role as SERDP Technical Coordinator for all
   Departmental activities for the DOE Offices (SC, EM, DP, EH, FE, PO)
   and the National Laboratories with the DoD, EPA and other federal
   agencies partnering with SERDP. These activities included: developing
   the statements of needs related to DOE/DoD mission for projects to be
   funded by SERDP, providing guidance for the fiscal year program,
   reviewing and selecting proposals, and reviewing SERDP new-start and
   continuing research projects. In addition to the role as SERDP
   Technical Coordinator, EML also participates as EM's repre- s e n t a t
   i ve s o n t h e "C l e a n up" a n d "C o m p l i a n ce" Te c h n i c
   a l T h r u s t A re a Wo r k i n g G ro u p s ( T TAWG). EML
   participated in the In-Pro g ress Rev i ews of projects funded in FY
   1999, rev i ewed FY 20 0 0 SERDP pro p o s a l s, and developed the
   Statement of Need for the FY 20 01 SERDP pro j e c t s. IN T E R AGENCY
   ARCTIC RESEARCH POLICY COMMITTEE (IARPC): The Arctic Research and
   Policy Act of 1984 (ARPA) provides for a comprehensive national policy
   dealing with national research needs and objectives in the Arctic. ARPA
   established an Arctic Research Commission (ARC) and the IARPC to help
   implement the Act. In con- junction with the ARC, IARPC establishes an
   integrated national Arctic research policy to guide federal agencies in
   developing and implementing their research programs in the Arctic.
   IARPC includes representatives from 13 federal agencies or offices,
   including DOE. In FY 1999, EML continued to provide staff

   THERMOLUMINESCENCE DOSIMETRY (TLD) EM Solid-state dosimeters are widely
   used for environmental monitoring around nuclear and radiological
   facilities. More than 21,000 stations worldwide are currently being
   monitored with such devices, encompassing fence line, off-site,
   residential, on-site, and long-term monitoring of areas awaiting
   cleanup. EML has played a major role in organizing and conducting the
   international dosimetry intercomparisons since their inception in 1974.
   These 11 intercomparisons serve to fill a global need for verification
   of TLDs. In FY 1999, EML began to organize the 12th International
   Intercomparison of Environmental Dosimeters in collaboration with BNL
   and NIST, which will be held in New York in the spring/summer of 2000.
   EML's TLD measurements are also being utilized at BNL's Building 650
   Sump Outfall Area and are providing accurate and precise data to show
   that contaminant movement is not taking place. These data are needed
   for regulatory pur- poses and will be important for establishing
   cleanup schedules and prioritization of areas of concern as remediation
   progresses throughout the BNL complex. BNL PECONIC RIVER STUDY EM
   Problems in survey design and quality control for an initial batch of
   sediment samples from the Peconic River in 1998 caused significant
   difficulties in data interpretation for BNL. In FY 1999, EML continued
   to provide technical assistance on sampling, radiochemical analyses and
   quality assurance to BNL in its efforts to characterize the magnitude
   and extent of any possible contamination, particularly plutonium, in
   the Peconic River and surrounding areas from past BNL operations. EML
   is also assisting the Suffolk County Health Department in performance
   testing of contractors to support the County's quality assurance
   efforts. WEST VALLEY DEMONSTRATION PROJECT EM In FY 1999, EML entered
   into an agreement with the West Valley Demonstration Project to provide
   document re- view and assistance in resolving questions on waste
   characterization and closure engineering report data. Support is being
   provided in the preparation and review of the National Environmental
   Policy Act (NEPA) document for the completion of the West Valley
   Demonstration Project and closure or long-term management of facilities
   at the Western New York Nuclear Service Center. Additional technical
   assistance is given as requested, e.g., assumption confirmation,
   impacts estimation, and public presentation support. 12 CENTER FOR RISK
   EXCELLENCE (CRE) EM The CRE works with the DOE laboratories to
   integrate risk understanding in environmental issues in order to manage
   and solve national environmental cleanup and stewardship problems. EML
   is supporting the CRE in its management and analysis of the Cleanup
   Criterial Decision Document (C2D2) Database which was developed by EM.
   The C2D2 database currently contains information on cleanup levels for
   various contaminants and media for about 300 DOE site areas. The data
   is drawn from regulatory compliance documents such as Records of
   Decision (RODs) and DOE technical reports. Representing an EM
   investment of many years, the C2D2 data- base is a valuable source of
   information for cleanup, long-term stewardship and interactions with
   regulators. In FY 1999, EML continued to lead CRE's effort by working
   closely with EM headquarters and the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL)
   to refine and update the database. EML is focusing on data analyses and
   the devel- opment of concise fact sheets in order to bring the database
   information to field managers who can use it in the development of
   restoration decisions. EML is also working with the Center and ANL to
   develop strategies for long-term management and to update the data for
   further in-depth analyses. EML SCIENTIST RECEIVES VICE-PRESIDENT GORE'S
   HAMMER AWARD As a member of the MARSSIM Workgroup, Carl V. Gogolak
   received the Hammer Award of Vice-President Gore's National Partnership
   for Reinventing Government. The MARSSIM team was recognized for working
   together to develop the new manual, which provides a single nationally
   consistent consensus guide for the process used to plan for, conduct,
   evaluate and document the measurements needed to show that a
   radioactively contaminated site has been cleaned up. MARSSIM NRC,EPA,EM
   MARSSIM provides an enhanced, cost-effective process for gathering
   information on planning, conducting, evaluating, and documenting
   environmental radiological surveys of surface soil and building
   surfaces at nuclear sites undergoing D&D. As a multi-agency effort
   (DOE, DoD, NRC, Army, Navy, and the Air Force), this information will
   be used for demonstrating compliance with regulations across all
   agencies, and for developing D&D implementation plans. This process,
   accepted by the EPA and the NRC, will have a major impact on the D&D of
   nuclear facilities. Several commercial nuclear power utilities are
   evaluating implementation at their sites. EML, after providing a lead
   technical role in the development of MARSSIM (NUREG-1575 and EPA
   402-R-97-016, December 1997), is now participating in training courses
   on MARSSIM, including final status survey design, data analysis, data
   quality assessment, and statistical methodology. The training was
   developed jointly by the EPA Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA)
   and the DOE/EM National Environmental Training Office (NETO). During FY
   1999, the MARSSIM training course was given 15 times in 14 different
   cities to the professional staff from DOE field sites, EPA's Regional
   Offices, and state regulatory agencies. EML participated as an
   instructor for three modules-Statistics, Survey Planning and Design,
   and Final Status Survey Data Analysis-for each of the three-day
   training courses. 13 ROVIDES DOE AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES WITH AN

   development and design sites more effective monitoring capabilities of
   field and laboratory-based adva n c e d for the detection of airborne
   ra d i o a c t i v i t y. EML DESIGNATED U.S. RADIONUCLIDE LABORATORY
   The U.S. Delegation to the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive
   Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) Organization has selected EML as the new
   location for the U.S. radionuclide laboratory to be incorporated into
   the International Monitoring System (IMS) in support of the
   Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. 14 AUTORAMP II EM A fully
   automated and completely unattended gamma-ray analysis system, AUTORAMP
   II collects large volume aerosol samples, measures these sam- ples
   using a high resolution germanium detector, and immediately transmits
   the resultant spectra to a data center using either a satellite
   telephone link or land telephone lines. The AUTORAMP has been deployed
   at Patrick Air Force Base, FL, since November 1996 to monitor
   atmospheric radioactivity. In FY 1999, EML continued to pur- sue
   AUTORAMP II deployments at EM sites to monitor the presence, or absence
   of atmospheric radioactivity. NEW AUTORAMP DEVELOPMENT EM For some
   applications, gamma-ray measurements are not suitable and alpha
   analyses are re q u i red. Airborne plutonium, for exa m p l e, cannot
   be detected by gamma-ray analys e s, but is detectable with alpha
   analys e s. In FY 1999, a pilot study was initiated to determine the
   feasibility of adding alpha measurement capability to the AU TORAMP to
   enable the detection of gross alpha and to perform alpha spectro m e t
   r y. The pre l i m i n a r y re s u l t s, along with the work of
   others who have obtained alpha spectrometry with air ionization
   chambers, a re encouraging and indicate a successful completion of this
   pro j e c t . TAGGED AEROSOL GENERATOR (TAG) SYSTEM NN EML's TAG,
   designed and constructed in FY 1999 for CTBT monitoring programs, will
   be used for in situ calibration of air sampling instrumentation in the
   field or at the production site. TAG will measure the collection
   efficiency of CTBT particulate samplers for the International
   Monitoring System site certifica- tion to verify that they meet
   required specifications. RADOMETER NN E M L's Radometer is a portable s
   u r vey instrument designed for real-time measurements of 2 2 2R n and
   2 20Rn. In FY 1999, a new ap- plication of the Radometer wa s p u rsued
   to utilize it in CTBT xenon monitoring for measuring ambient radon
   concentra t i o n s, which is a necessary corre c t i o n for accurate
   xenon determination. 15 EML'S GLOBAL NETWORK NN EML maintains a
   worldwide network of aerosol and deposition sampling stations to
   document spatial and t e m p o ral trends in the distribution of
   artificial and naturally produced radionuclides in the atmosphere and
   to rapidly identify any new sources of activity due to accidental
   releases or violations of the CTBT. Data fro m remote on-site analysis
   systems are re c e i ved via satellite. Samples are re c e i ved,
   analyzed and rev i ewed at EML. EML's Global Network has become a
   valuable asset in monitoring compliance to treaties and in acting as an
   early warning system for nuclear re l e a s e s. ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLE
   ARCHIVE AND INTERNET DATABASE NN EML has developed and maintains a
   unique and extensive archive of more than 50,000 environmental samples,
   some of which were collected more than 40 years ago. Many of these
   historic samples, collected during the period of atmospheric nuclear
   weapons testing, have unique isotopic compositions and, therefore, can
   be used to test and evaluate instruments developed by the NN-20
   community and others. In addition, the samples can be used for
   geolocation in forensic nuclear anal- yses, for identification of
   environmental signatures of nuclear activities, and for the
   establishment of current baseline values for selected environmental
   signatures. This archive of records is accessible over the Internet at
   EML's Web Site. 16 Mitchell D. Erickson, Director Phone: (212) 620-3619
