   FOR ATTORNEYS COMPLETING CIVIL COVER SHEET FORM JS-44 Authority For
   Civil Cover Sheet The JS-44 civil cover sheet and the information
   contained herein neither replaces nor supplements the filings and
   service of pleading or other papers as required by law, except as
   provided by local rules of court. This form, approved by the Judicial
   Conference of the United States in September 1974, is required for the
   use of the Clerk of Court for the purpose of initiating the civil
   docket sheet. Consequently, a civil cover sheet is submitted to the
   Clerk of Court for each civil complaint filed. The attorney filing a
   case should complete the form as follows: I. (a) Plaintiffs-Defendants.
   Enter names (last, first, middle initial) of plaintiff and defendant.
   If the plaintiff or defendant is a government agency, use only the full
   name or standard abbreviations. If the plaintiff or defendant is an
   official within a government agency, identify first the agency and then
   the official, giving both name and title. (b.) County of Residence. For
   each civil case filed, except U.S. plaintiff cases, enter the name of
   the county where the first listed plaintiff resides at the time of
   filing. In U.S. plaintiff cases, enter the name of the county in which
   the first listed defendant resides at the time of filing. (NOTE: In
   land condemnation cases, the county of residence of the "defendant" is
   the location of the tract of land involved.) (c) Attorneys. Enter the
   firm name, address, telephone number, and attorney of record. If there
   are several attorneys, list them on an attachment, noting in this
   section "(see attachment)". II. Jurisdiction . The basis of
   jurisdiction is set forth under Rule 8(a), F.R.C.P., which requires
   that jurisdictions be shown in pleadings. Place an "X" in one of the
   boxes. If there is more than one basis of jurisdiction, precedence is
   given in the order shown below. United States plaintiff. (1)
   Jurisdiction based on 28 U.S.C. 1345 and 1348. Suits by agencies and
   officers of the United States, are included here. United States
   defendant. (2) When the plaintiff is suing the United States, its
   officers or agencies, place an "X" in this box. Federal question. (3)
   This refers to suits under 28 U.S.C. 1331, where jurisdiction arises
   under the Constitution of the United States, an amendment to the
   Constitution, an act of Congress or a treaty of the United States. In
   cases where the U.S. is a party, the U.S. plaintiff or defendant code
   takes precedence, and box 1 or 2 should be marked. Diversity of
   citizenship. (4) This refers to suits under 28 U.S.C. 1332, where
   parties are citizens of different states. When Box 4 is checked, the
   citizenship of the different parties must be checked. (See Section III
   below; federal question actions take precedence over diversity cases.)
   III. Residence (citizenship) of Principal Parties. This section of the
   JS-44 is to be completed if diversity of citizenship was indicated
   above. Mark this section for each principal party. IV. Nature of Suit.
   Place an "X" in the appropriate box. If the nature of suit cannot be
   determined, be sure the cause of action, in Section IV below, is
   sufficient to enable the deputy clerk or the statistical clerks in the
   Administrative Office to determine the nature of suit. If the cause
   fits more than one nature of suit, select the most definitive. V.
   Origin . Place an "X" in one of the seven boxes. Original Proceedings.
   (1) Cases which originate in the United States district courts. Removed
   from State Court. (2) Proceedings initiated in state courts may be
   removed to the district courts under Title 28 U.S.C., Section 1441.
   When the petition for removal is granted, check this box. Remanded from
   Appellate Court. (3) Check this box for cases remanded to the district
   court for further action. Use the date of remand as the filing date.
   Reinstated or Reopened. (4) Check this box for cases reinstated or
   reopened in the district court. Use the reopening date as the filing
   date. Transferred from Another District. (5) For cases transferred
   under Title 28 U.S.C. Section 1404(a) Do not use this for within
   district transfers or multidistrict litigation transfers. Multidistrict
   Litigation. (6) Check this box when a multidistrict case is transferred
   into the district under authority of Title 28 U.S.C. Section 1407. When
   this box is checked, do not check (5) above. Appeal to District Judge
   from Magistrate Judgment. (7) Check this box for an appeal from a
   magistrate judge's decision. VI. Cause of Action . Report the civil
   statute directly related to the cause of action and give a brief
   description of the cause. VII. Requested in Complaint . Class Action.
   Place an "X" in this box if you are filing a class action under Rule
   23, F.R.Cv.P. Demand. In this space enter the dollar amount (in
   thousands of dollars) being demanded or indicate other demand such as a
   preliminary injunction. Jury Demand. Check the appropriate box to
   indicate whether or not a jury is being demanded. VIII. Related Cases .
   This section of the JS-44 is used to reference related pending cases if
   any. If there are related pending cases, insert the docket numbers and
   the corresponding judge names for such cases. Date and Attorney
   Signature . Date and sign the civil cover sheet.
