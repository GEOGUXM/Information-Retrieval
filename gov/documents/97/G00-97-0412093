Print Student Aid Report (SAR)

   You can print a Student Aid Report (SAR) if you submitted a FAFSA for
   the 2001 - 2002 School Year (July 1st 2001 - June 30th 2002) or the
   2002 - 2003 School Year (July 1st 2002 - June 30th 2003).

   To print a SAR, you need to have a PIN from the Department of
   Education. If you do not have a PIN, or need to request your PIN again,
   go to the PIN Site.

   If you know your PIN, select the year you would like to print a SAR for
   and select Next.
