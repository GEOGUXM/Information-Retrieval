     __________________________________________________________________


   The Judicial Opinion Database is a publicly-accessible repository for
   Court-issued Judicial Opinions. It is not comprehensive. The opinions
   comtained herein are only those judged to be of potential interest to
   the general public or legal community.

   The documents contained within this Database are only copies of actual
   Judicial Opinions. All legal references should be made to the original
   case opinion publicly available from the Clerk's office.

   All opinions contained herein are stored in WordPerfect format. Your
   machine must have WordPerfect version 7.0 (or later release) or another
   word-processor which can convert files of this type already installed
   in order to view these documents correctly.

   Your word-processor can be configured to automatically load each
   opinion as you choose it. Here's how to set it up. Otherwise, each
   document should be saved for later viewing.
