                         BUSH SPEECH "REFRESHING AND
                           INSPIRING" SAYS BENNETT
                                   1-29-02

   WASHINGTON, D.C.
   Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah) tonight issued the following statement on
   President George W. Bush's State of the Union address:

    "During the president's last address to Congress over four months ago,
   we saw the president's resolve with respect to the war. Tonight we see
   the president's vision with respect to the county and the kind of world
   we'll have when the war is over.  I found that tremendously powerful.
   This was a refreshing and inspiring speech which clearly demonstrates
   that George W. Bush is on top of his job.
