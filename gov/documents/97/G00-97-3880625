   Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, and
   Wisconsin comprise the Region. These eight states encompass about
   458,000 square miles. The landscape, natural resources, and human
   population of the Region are as diverse as any in the United States.

   There are over 2,400 NRCS employees within the region. Most of the
   Midwest's employees are located in U.S. Department of Agriculture
   (USDA) Field Office Service Centers at the local level. There are
   currently 652 Field Office Service Centers with the Region.

   Employees in the Midwest Region coordinate and carry out all activities
   in cooperation with numerous conservation partners, including soil and
   water conservation districts, state and federal agencies, and many
   other groups and organizations.
