   ABOUT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT Fire Department Logo

   Founded in 1892, Elk Grove's Fire Department started with a single hose
   cart and a small group of dedicated volunteers. From these humble
   beginnings, the Department has forged a lasting presence in the
   community.

   In 1985, the Department merged with the Elk Grove Recreation and Parks
   District to form what is known today as the Elk Grove Community
   Services District (CSD). As a member of the CSD, the Department
   provides fire, rescue and emergency medical services to an area
   covering over 130 square miles of southern Sacramento County and
   encompassing the communities of Elk Grove, Laguna, Sheldon and
   Franklin. Firemen

   The CSD opened its fifth fire station in November 1999 and expanded the
   Fire Department's personnel base by 15 line personnel - bringing Fire
   Department staffing totals to 75 line personnel, 8 chief officers and 7
   other support personnel.

   The Department works closely with other Sacramento County fire service
   agencies to maintain a progressive approach to serving the needs of the
   District's constituents. Countywide utilization of the Incident Command
   System and the creation of the Sacramento Regional Fire/EMS
   Communications Center provides the Fire Disaster Department with the
   ability to mobilize resources from over 85 fire stations in the area to
   respond to major incidents. Additionally, the Department has instituted
   an alphanumeric pager system to recall personnel during major
   emergencies or disasters, comprehensive wellness (fitness) program and
   an ongoing training curriculum to maximize the performance of the
   Department's emergency responders.

   The Elk Grove CSD Fire Department also recognizes the value of a
   comprehensive fire prevention effort -- especially as the District
   continues to experience steep increases in population growth and
   commercial development. The Department's Fire Prevenion Bureau conducts
   1500 new construction inspections each year and actively implements
   annual weed abatement and fireworks enforcement campaigns.
   Additionally, the Department's Public Education Division coordinates a
   number of fire safety activities each year including the Department's
   annual fire station open house, the "Change Your Clock Change Your
   Smoke Detector Batteries" Campaign, and a budding partnership with the
   Elk Grove Unified School District to teach children in grades K-3 from
   the National Fire Protection Association's Learn Not To Burn
   curriculum.

   Through these and other efforts, the Elk Grove CSD Fire Department
   maintains its committment to protecting the lives, property and
   environment from fire and other natural and manmade disasters and
   emergencies in a courteous, timely and effective manner.
