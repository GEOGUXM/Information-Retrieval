   MP-6 And Bypass Line In Service
   Our second accelerator (MP-6) is complete along with the "bypass line"
   which brings beam around MP-7 into the target room. See a diagram of
   the new facility (last updated 12-6-01). The diagram is available as an
   Adobe Acrobat (pdf) file.

   MP-6 To Deliver Beam To RHIC
   MP-6 and its associated Bypass Line is now (7-18) being readied to
   deliver gold ions to RHIC. This will allow MP-7 to be depressurized,
   opened and undergo several days of maintenance. There will be no SEU
   operation during this time. During this maintenance we will replace
   terminal stripping foils and perform preventative maintenance on the
   mechanical components of the charging system. We are anticipating a
   return to simultaneous RHIC/SEU operation by 7-27.

   New Calendar Showing MP-6 and MP-7
   A new calendar showing the availability of both MP-6 and MP7 is now
   available. When looking at the calendar, the 3 upper entries in each
   day cell are the 3 shifts of MP-6 and the lower 3 entries in each day
   cell are the 3 shifts of MP-7. You can go to the Calendar now and check
   it out.

   AGS/RHIC Summer Run In Progress
   We are now involved in the AGS/RHIC Summer 2001 Heavy Ion Run. We were
   pleased with the results of our dual operating mode; SEU beam from MP-6
   and TtB beam from MP-7. We can support both the SEU program and TtB
   simultaneously. During the week of 7-23 to 7-27 the AGS/RHIC program
   will be supplied with gold ions from MP-6 while MP-7 is taken off line
   for maintenance.

   Please check our Calendar to see what we are doing and to determine the
   availability of our facility for your needs.

   Check Out Our Web Site
   You can see our list of available ion species.
   You can use our on-line LET Calculator to find LETs and Ranges of
   various ions in various targets at various energies.
   You can use our web-based time request form to reserve time at our
   facility.

   It is now necessary for users who are not US citizens to submit a
   completed Form IA-473 prior to arrival (90 days in some cases) at our

   User Questionaire
   The Tandem Facility User Questionaire is now available on-line. This is
   the form you need to complete and return to us at least a week prior to
   your run. You can print a copy for yourself if you don't have a blank
   one available. This questionnaire is also available in MS Word format
   or in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) format.

   By Popular Request
   A short biography of Robert J. Van de Graaff is still available. This
   is a chronology of his life where you can learn something about the man
   who invented the electrostatic particle accelerator. This biography has
   been very popular and has received many 'hits'.
