   December 12, 2001, Fresno, California--Exports mean growth for U.S.
   businesses and the nation's economy. That's the message from U.S.
   Department of Commerce Deputy Assistant Secretary Bruce W. Blakeman,
   who today presented the Presidents "E" Award for Excellence in
   Exporting to The Export Center at The Training Institute of the State
   Center Community College District in recognition of its outstanding
   achievement in facilitating exports from area companies. Chancellor
   Judith Redwine and Candy Hansen accepted the award on behalf of the
   Center. With only ten 2001 recipients, this award is the nations
   highest honor for achievement in exporting.

   Since its establishment in 1989, The Export Center has facilitated well
   over $230 million in export sales. Including sales from trade shows the
   export actions total rises to $400 million. The Center provided export
   counseling and technical assistance to 1,700 companies, responded to
   over 20,000 exporting inquiries, and conducted 345 training seminars,
   conferences and workshops for 9,050 clients.

   Deputy Assistant Secretary Blakeman also honored San Jose company
   BioMed Diagnostics, Inc., which recently made its first export sale,
   with the U.S. Commercial Service's Export Achievement Certificate.
   Since 1989, the company has manufactured and marketed "gold standard"
   in vitro diagnostic products for the detection of infectious diseases
   and fungi in the human clinical, veterinary, and industrial markets.
   BioMed Diagnostics recently signed a distributor in Milan, Italy.

   Established by an Executive Order of the President in 1961, the "E"
   Award is managed by the Commerce Department's U.S. Commercial Service,
   an export promotion agency with a worldwide network of offices,
   including one in Fresno. The "E" Award for Export Services recognizes
   organizations like The Export Center that assist exporting efforts.

   Deputy Assistant Secretary Blakeman directs 350 U.S.-based trade
   specialists. In 2001, he said, the U.S. Commercial Service helped U.S
   businesses generate export sales worth more than $34 billion.
   "Ninety-five percent of the worlds consumers live outside the U.S.,"
   said Blakeman. "And because the worlds consumers appreciate the
   quality of American-made products, our companies enjoy a competitive
   advantage in many countries." Although there are around 23 million
   small and medium-sized businesses in the U.S., Commerce Department
   officials say that only about 1% export. "Our job is to explain the
   benefits of exporting, identify best markets, and find qualified
   buyers," Blakeman added.
