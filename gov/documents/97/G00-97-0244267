                            Federal Grant Review

   The State Clearinghouse serves as the state's Single Point of Contact
   for the review of federal grant applications and federal development
   programs, pursuant to Presidential Executive Order No. 12372.
   Notification of certain federal grant applications must be provided to
   the Clearinghouse, which in turn distributes this information to state
   and local agencies for review and comment.

   If you are an applicant for a federal grant, loan, or other form of
   financial assistance, you may be required to submit information about
   your federal application to the State Clearinghouse. Only applications
   for the specified list of federal programs must be submitted to the
   Clearinghouse. Click here to view a listing of these federal programs
   for which state review is required. If your grant program appears on
   this list, you are required to send the State Clearinghouse one copy of
   your application cover form (Standard Form 424) to the address listed
   below. You should not send your full application package. Fax copies of
   the completed Form 424 are acceptable.
