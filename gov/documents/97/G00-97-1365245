   Notice concerning delivery of 1st class and Priority mail

   The delivery of first-class mail to NEA has been delayed since
   mid-October and delays are expected to continue for the foreseeable
   future. Until normal mail service resumes, please consider using
   alternative delivery services, particularly if you are sending
   time-sensitive materials.
   Some or all of the first-class and Priority mail we receive may be put
   through an irradiation process to protect against biological
   contamination. Please be advised that support materials (e.g. CDs,
   videos, slides) put through this process are suffering irrevocable
   damage. If you are sending these kinds of materials, we encourage you
   to consider using alternate delivery services.

   Please accept our sincere apologies for any inconvenience this may
   cause. Contact us if you have any questions.
