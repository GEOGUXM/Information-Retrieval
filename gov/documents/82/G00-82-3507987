                           The CPUC and Consumers

   The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is the key source for
    help and information for customers of investor-owned utilities in our
    state. If you use natural gas to cook with, electricity to light your
   home, water to wash clothes, the phone to keep in touch with family, or
   a moving company to move within California, the CPUC is there for you.
    A good first place to look for help would be our Consumer Help Desk.

    The Commission, consisting of five members appointed by the Governor,
    and working with a staff which have wide-ranging professional skills,
   monitors utility and transportation company operations that most affect
                                 consumers:
     * how much utilities charge for their services,
     * whether the products and services they provide are safe and
       reliable,
     * whether the utilities' investors have a reasonable opportunity to
       get a fair rate of return on their investment.

      The Commission thus has the dual responsibility of protecting the
          interests both of consumers and of utility shareholders.

      Below is a list of some of key issues of particular interest and
                       importance for consumers today:
     * Telecommunications Consumer Bill of Rights
     * Lists of Electric Service Providers

     * By Name
     * By Number

     * Household Goods Moving within California
     * Passenger Carriers
