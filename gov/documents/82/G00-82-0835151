                                 Disclaimer:

   This project has just recently started and is in a developmental stage.
    Availablility to customers depends greatly on availablity of beam at
   LANSCE. The beam will be down until late February or early March. There
    is also much work to be done to refine our capabilites. Thank you for
                               your patience.

                                General Uses:

     * Generation of images corresponding to density, atomic number, and
       thickness variations of static, solid objects .
     __________________________________________________________________

                          Examples of Applications:

     * Check for internal defects such as voids, cracks or inclusions in
       materials.
     * Determination of internal clearances between parts in an assembly,
       to check for displacement of internal components.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Test Samples:

   Objects are limited in thickness to a few inches of steel. The parts to
               be imaged must be smaller than 4 inches square.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Limitations:

     Laminations, tight cracks, or cracks parallel to the film plane are
    N09T readily discernible. Beam time and availabilty are also limited.
     __________________________________________________________________

                         Estimated Evaluation Time:

    Setup typically takes a few minutes, the exposure typically 1 to 5.6
   seconds. The image is displayed as a 16bit gray scale image and can be
                           exported as a PCX file.

                                 Principle:

    Neutrons from a large spallation source at LANSCE are thermalized and
    collimated. The colliated beam is guided toward the sample which will
   scatter or attenuate the flux of neutrons. A scintillating material is
   placed between the sample and the detector array. The neutrons incident
   on the scintillating material produce visible light. The visible light
    generates electron-hole pairs in the biased photodiode. After pulsing
     the gates of a thin film transistor within the detector array. The
     charge generated in the detector is then transferred to the signal
    output columns, amplified, and readout to the computer digitally. The
      image is available for veiwing immediately after data collection.

                                 Equipment:

   We are currently testing and evaluating our radiographic capabilites at
    the LANSCE neutron spallation source. Over the next few months tests
     will be done with neutrons generated from the decay of Californium.
      The scintillating material varies and can be selected for various
      purposes although our best images have been produced using a ZnS
     scintillator doped with small amounts of Li and Ag which have high
                           Nuetron cross-sections.
   Our detector is an EG&G/Heimann RTM 128 demonstration unit. The RTM 128
   is a 96mm square amorphous silicon image sensing photodiode array. The
        array consists of 128x128 pixels with a pitch of 750microns.
    Eventually, we would purchase a similar detector with a 512x512 pixel
      array for ima ging at a higher resolution and for imaging larger
                                  objects.

  The image below displays a Cadmium sheet (left) which has a large neutron
 cross section and a mild steel calibration test piece (lower right) with a
small slot and two small holes machined into it. A larger image can be viewed

scintillator at LANSCE. If you view the larger image by clicking on this one
                    you can see the threads on the bolt.

The image below shows a Berylium block with (from left to right) a poly screw
  with stainless steel nut on it, a hollow brass bolt, and a hardend steel
  bolt. Note that you can see the threads on the bolts and in the Be Block.
