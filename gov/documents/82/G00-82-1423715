   recently revealed high explosives (HE) contamination at depths from 750
   to 1500 ft, including in the regional aquifer. The levels of HE are
   over 40 times the Environmental Protection Agency lifetime health
   advisory for the HE RDX (cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine). This discovery
   has heightened concerns among members of the public, neighboring Indian
   pueblos, and other stakeholders about groundwater contamination from
   Laboratory operations. In addition to HE, barium and nitrate
   contamination are also of concern at TA-16. We are determining the
   extent of contamination and investigating the processes that control
   contaminant concentrations in the TA-16 mesa and canyon environments.
