   Dr. M. J. Mahoney is a former radio astronomer with more than thirty
   years of hands-on experience in designing and building instruments
   covering the entire radio spectrum from sub-millimeter to decameter
   wavelengths.  He obtained B.Sc. (Honors), M.Sc., Ph.D. degrees in
   Physics from the University of British Columbia.  After completing the
   Ph.D. degree in 1976, Dr. Mahoney became the Resident Director of the
   University of Maryland's Clark Lake Radio Observatory, where he was
   responsible for conversion of the observatory's TPT phased array into a
   powerful decametric-wavelength synthesis telescope. His areas of
   research included extra-galactic radio sources, supernova remnants, the
   ISM in normal galaxies, millisecond pulsars, and solar and ionospheric
   physics.

   In 1987, Dr. Mahoney accepted a position at Caltech's Jet Propulsion
   Laboratory in the Microwave Observational Systems section, where he was
   responsible for payload design studies of various submillimeter
   wavelength missions. These included the Large Deployable Reflector
   (LDR), the Synthesis Array for Lunar Submillimeter Astronomy (SALSA),
   the Submillimeter Intermediate Mission (SMIM), and most recently, the
   Far-Infrared and Submillimeter Space Telescope (FIRST), a cornerstone
   mission of the European Space Agency. To support FIRST, Dr. Mahoney was
   appointed Submillimeter Technologist to oversee technology development
   at JPL for the heterodyne submillimeter-wavelength receiver on FIRST.
   His astronomical research at JPL has involved the use of mid- infrared
   cameras to understand the formation and evolution of stars and
   planetary systems.

   From 1992 to 1996 Dr. Mahoney served as the Technical Group Supervisor
   of the Ground-Based Microwave Applications Group. While supervising
   this group, he became very interested in the capabilities and potential
   for the Microwave Temperature Profiler (MTP). In 1996 he resigned the
   Supervisor position to spend full time on MTP-related research, and has
   served as Co-I or PI on the following field studies: VOTE and SUCCESS
   (1996), SONEX (1998), PEM Tropics B (1999), and SOLVE (1999-2000) on
   the NASA DC-8; POLARIS (1997),  CWVCS (1998) and SOLVE (2000) on the
   NASA ER-2; WAM (1998), ACCENT (1999) and ACCENT II (2000) on the NASA
   WB-57F, and TexAQS 2000 (2000) on the NCAR Electra..
