      The California Fire Plan is the stateÂ’s road map for reducing the risk
      of wildfire. By placing the emphasis on what needs to be done long
      before a fire starts, the Fire Plan looks to reduce fire fighting costs
      and property losses, increase firefighter safety, and to contribute to
      ecosystem health. The California Fire Plan is a cooperative effort
      between the State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection and the
      California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF.)
