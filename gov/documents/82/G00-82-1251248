   The Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML) is a government-owned,
   government-operated laboratory, programmatically under the Office of
   Environmental Management (EM) in the U.S. Department of Energy. The
   Laboratory is administered by the Chicago Operations Office (CH). EML,
   a descendant of the Manhattan Project, was established in 1947. It was
   formerly known as the Health and Safety Laboratory (HASL).

   EML provides program management, technical assistance and data quality
   assurance for measurements of radiation and radioactivity relating to
   environmental restoration, global nuclear non-proliferation, and other
   priority issues for the Department of Energy, as well as for other
   government, national and international organizations.
