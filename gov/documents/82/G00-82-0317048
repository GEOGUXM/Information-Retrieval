   The study of geomagnetism is one of the oldest of the geophysical
   sciences. Since before the publication of Gilbert's De Magnete in 1600,
   people have sought to solve the mysteries of the Earth's magnetic
   field.

   The National Geophysical Data Center maintains extensive archives of
   geomagnetic data to further the understanding of Earth magnetism.
   Answers to some commonly asked questions can be found at our FAQ site.

   Geomagnetic data at NGDC include surface, ocean, airborne and satellite
   measurements, as well as models of the main field and its secular
   change, and models of the space - earth environment. NGDC participates
   in national and international projects involving the preparation of
   regional and global geomagnetic models and local and global indices of
   geomagnetic activity. Data on the Earth's ancient magnetic field are
   available from archeomagnetic and paleomagnetic measurements. Please
   see additional information on geomagnetism.
