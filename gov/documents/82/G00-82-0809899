   The Office of Environment Technologies Industries (ETI) at the U.S.
   Department of Commerce offers many resources to help finance exporting
   abroad. Whether funding is needed for an existing project or a brand
   new exporting venture, the ETI can be a tremendous service. The ETI is
   a primary resource for finding help to finance your environmental
   exports and can be used to answer questions about institutions that
   offer grants and loans to exporting firms.
   In addition, ETI has published two comprehensive guides to financing
   called "Financing Environmental Exports - A Guide to the Fundamentals
   and Sources" and "Aid-to-Trade: Opportunities for U.S. Environmental
   Technologies Exports". To obtain a copy, call 202-482-5225.
