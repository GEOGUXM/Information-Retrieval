What Is Universal Access and Why Is It Important?

     A site that is universally accessible is available to all possible
     audiences. This includes users with physical disabilities as well as
     visitors using outdated or less sophisticated computer software and
     equipment. According to the World Wide Web Applications and the
     Internet Best Practices and Guidelines established by the U.S.
     Department of Health and Human Services:

     "All web site pages shall provide graphic and table information in
     text format to ensure the content is accessible and readable for
     users with disabilities as well as accommodate various browser
     software packages and low-bandwidth access."

     The National Diabetes Education Program (NDEP) recognizes the
     importance of this recommendation and has incorporated universal
     accessibility into the design of its web site. NDEP is committed to
     providing health information to the widest possible audience,
     including groups under-served by traditional information
     dissemination.

What Makes the NDEP Site Universally Accessible?

     A text version of the NDEP home page is available for visitors who
     use screen readers or text-only browsers. All images, graphics, and
     video files are accompanied by alternative text (alt-text) or
     descriptions (d-links) for blind and visually impaired users.
     Alternative text and captioning accompanies all audio files for
     hearing impaired visitors.

Instructions for Blind and Visually Impaired Users

     This web site has been designed to be used with a screen-reader.

     All images on this site are accompanied by an alt-text tag. These
     tags are visible and will be read by the screen-reader when you turn
     images "off" in your browser, if your browser supports the alt-text
     function.

     Some images are accompanied by a "d". The "d" is a link that will
     bring you to a text description of the image. The description is
     typically two or three sentences, and may contain links. At the end
     of the description is a "Return" link. Selecting "Return" will take
     you back to the image.
