                           Welcome to FX-Advanced

   FX-Advanced is the over-arching term encompassing FSL's UNIX
   workstation activities. While the focus of this work is
   WFO-Advanced/AWIPS, other efforts include work with the NWS Aviation
   Weather Center; Air Force Global Weather Center; FX-Collaborate, a Java
   system for forecaster collaboration; and a port of FX software to
   Linux.
   Here are a few links of interest:
     * A short introduction to WFO-Advanced (last updated 23 Oct 00).
     * A rather detailed overview of WFO-Advanced. Although this was
       written in 1997, it still describes the bulk of FSL's contribution
       to AWIPS.
     * A collection of publications related to WFO-Advanced. (WFO-Advanced
       is the realization of FX-Advanced that is tailored for use at a NWS
       Weather Forecast Office. WFO-Advanced constitutes the bulk of the
       forecaster component of AWIPS. We are currently completing work on
       our portion of AWIPS Build 5.1.2, which is scheduled for fielding
       beginning late 2001.
     * Configuration information for WFO-A systems. This lists the Boulder
       (FSL/NWS) data servers and their associated text and graphics
       workstations, including information on software version and
       installation date.
     * Release notes for the current software build and for other builds.
     * Requirements for our various software builds.
     * Our C/C++ coding standards.
     * Sean Kelly's homepage which contains copious quantities of
       WFO-Advanced related design and other documents.
