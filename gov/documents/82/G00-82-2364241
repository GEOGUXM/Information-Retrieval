   GEODE (Geo-Data Explorer) -- A U.S. Geological Survey Application for
   Data Retrieval, Display, and Analysis through the Internet

   By Marc Levine and Adam Schultz

   Map created using GEODE and the CREATE BUFFER LAYER feature   GEODE
   (Geo-Data Explorer) is a free service offered by the U.S. Geological
   Survey (USGS) on the Internet at http://geode.usgs.gov/. It provides
   digital geographically referenced data to the desktop computers of any
   user, including policymakers, land and resource managers, educators,
   industries, and private citizens. The ultimate goal of GEODE is to
   provide diverse users a gateway (data portal) that will supply
   real-time data and analysis over the Internet without the need for
   special hardware, software, and training.

   GEODE allows the user to retrieve, display, and manipulate multiple
   types of information, such as satellite images, geologic maps,
   graphics, live camera feed, three-dimensional images, and spreadsheet
   data. The available data coverages (see box) are dynamic, as they are
   frequently updated; some datasets are international in scope, and some
   are specific to the United States. Users can combine these datasets to
   design their own maps and digital products.
