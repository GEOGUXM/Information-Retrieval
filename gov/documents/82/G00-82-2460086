   Mental Health Related Services and Programs

   Mental Health, Department of
   Program:
   Mental Health Employment: The State Department of Mental Health
   provides services in the following four broad areas:
     * System leadership for state and local mental health departments.
     * Systems oversight, evaluation, and monitoring.
     * Administration of federal grants.
     * Operation of four state hospitals (Atascadero, Metropolitan, Napa
   and Acute Psychiatric Program at the California Medical Facility at
   Vacaville).

   Target Population:
   The target population can range from individuals with severe and
   persistent mental disabilities, as defined by mental health law, to
   individuals who are identified by local county welfare departments as
   CalWORKs clients with mental disabilities that present barriers to
   employment. CalWORKs clients must be referred to local mental health by
   the local county welfare department.
   Services:
   The array and scope of mental health services can vary from county to
   county, dependent upon available resources. Mental health services may
   range from:
     * Pre-crisis & Crisis.
     * Evaluation & Assessment.
     * Individual Service Plans
     * Medication
     * Education and Management
     * Case Management
     * 24 Hour Treatment Services
     * Rehabilitation & Support
     * Vocational Rehabilitation
     * Residential Services

   Employment Services:
   CalWORKs recipients
   Legislative intent is to enable those CalWORKs clients who have been
   determined to have mental or emotional disabilities to receive
   necessary mental health services that enable these individuals to make
   the transition from welfare to work. The local county welfare
   department and the local mental health department are to jointly
   develop a plan for mental health employment assistance services.
   Subject to specific expenditure authority, mental health services must
   include: assessment; case management as appropriate and as determined
   by the county; treatment and rehabilitation services in coordination
   with an individual's welfare-to-work plan; in cases where a secondary
   diagnosis of substance abuse is made in a person referred for mental or
   emotional disorders, the welfare-to-work plan shall also address the
   substance abuse treatment needs of the participant and lastly, a
   process by which the county can identify those with severe mental
   disabilities that may qualify them for aid under the State
   Supplementary Program for Aged, Blind and Disabled.
