              NCEP OMB Experimental Coastal Visual Range Guidance

                                                       rev 12 October 1999

    The lowest layer Coastal Visual Range Guidance products are provided as
    post-processed fields direct from the eta-32 model. These fields are in km
    and have been converted to n mi on the depictions shown on this web page.
    The 950 hPa Coastal Visual Range Guidance products are created by
    post-processing the 950 hPa level cloud liquid water fields from the 32 km
    resolution eta model and converting it to n mi.

   These products are valid all year for the coasts of the contiguous
   United States, Alaska and Gulf of Alaska. Three contours are given: 7 n
   mi in blue (the maximum range that can be seen from the bridge of a
   ship under normal conditions), 3 n mi in green (of interest to mariners
   and must be reported in offshore and coastal forecasts by National
   Weather Service Forecast Offices), and 0.5 n mi in yellow (this range
   is the WMO definition of dense fog and can be used as a guide to
   forecast fog, assuming meteorological conditions warrent such a
   forecast).

   The 950 hPa visual guidance is presented to give the viewer a means of
   determining what may be causing the reduction in visual range at the
   model lowest layer. For more detailed information, see the sections
   called about the coastal visual guidance or forecaster considerations.
   The figures are in gif format and are on the order of 80k each. To ftp
   gif or postscript data, ftp to polar.wwb.noaa.gov and cd to
   /pub/coastal.fog.

   Since these are experimental products, we are interested in getting
   feedback on their utility. Please send questions and comments to
