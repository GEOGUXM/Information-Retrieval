                             THE FALL OF PARITY

                 The Discovery that Parity is Not Conserved

     [Assembly of Low Temperature Equipment] Between Christmas of 1956
     and New Year's Day, the first exciting results emerged from a
     difficult but fundamental scientific experiment at the National
     Bureau of Standards (NBS) in Washington, DC [currently the National
     Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]. The experiment
     showed, strikingly and convincingly, that in at least one
     fundamental physical process, our world is distinguishable from its
     mirror image. Physicists had long assumed the opposite. They
     constructed their theories so as to ensure that the corresponding
     mathematical property, called parity, remains unaltered
     - is conserved - in all subatomic processes. Thus this experiment
     brought about the fall of parity from its exalted position alongside
     such well conserved physical quantities as energy, momentum, and
     electric charge.

   Exhibit designed by W. C. Martin, J. Coursey, and R. A. Dragoset

     This exhibit was prepared by the NIST Physics Laboratory as a
     project of the NIST Museum Committee. It is one of the exhibit
     panels in the NIST Virtual Museum.

     Much of the experimental apparatus for the experiment described here
     was reassembled with the help of Raymond Hayward and Bruce Dove for
     an exhibit entitled ``The Fall of Parity'' shown at the National
     Museum of American History (NMAH) in Washington, DC, during 1982 to
     mark the 25^th anniversary of the experiment. That exhibit with the
     apparatus is now in the NIST Museum in Gaithersburg, MD on long-term
     loan from NMAH.

     The title, introductory paragraph, ``Parity: What's Not Conserved?''
     and certain other material in the exhibit presented here are taken
     from, or based on, the NMAH exhibit by Paul Forman, curator for
     modern physics at NMAH, Smithsonian Institution. The ``Descriptive
     Explanation of the Experiment'' is largely taken from an account
     published in the NBS Technical News Bulletin, Vol. 41, No. 4 (April
     1957). Raymond Hayward, Ralph Hudson, and Michael Danos gave advice
     and were helpful in other ways in the preparation of this exhibit.
     Michelle Hane provided assistance in producing some of the documents
     in HTML code.
