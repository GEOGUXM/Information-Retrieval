   Education is key to the successful participation in the labor force for
   people with disabilities. The resources here will provide adults with
   learning and other disabilities the critical information they need to
   increase the quality of the education they receive. Among the subject
   areas included are high school equivalency testing, vocational
   education, service learning, literacy, and information for the
   college-bound student with disabilities.

   The Administration will expand access to quality education for
   Americans with disabilities. New Freedom Initiative
