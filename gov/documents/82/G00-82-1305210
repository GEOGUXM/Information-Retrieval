      Program Announcement for FY 2002 Biocomplexity in the Environment
                             Competition Issued

   NSF seeks to draw on the participation of relevant science and
   engineering disciplines to promote interdisciplinary research necessary
   for improved understanding of complex environmental and global change
   processes. To accomplish these goals, NSF activities related to
   Environmental Research and Education (ERE) involve support of basic
   disciplinary research, focused interdisciplinary research, and a broad
   range of educational, international, and outreach functions that cut
   across the entire spectrum of environment and natural resources
   scientific interests.
   In FY 2001, NSF funding in ERE areas will total approximately $750
   million.
   Included in the ERE portfolio is Biocomplexity in the Environment (BE),
   one of NSF's Priority Areas. The BE program is a multi-year investment
   designed to promote new approaches to investigating the interactivty of
   biota and the environment...
