From the Archivist

   John W.Carlin

   Welcome to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

   NARA is an independent Federal agency that helps preserve our nation's
   history by overseeing the management of all Federal records. Our
   mission is to ensure ready access to the essential evidence that
   documents the rights of American citizens, the actions of Federal
   officials, and the national experience. We must make it easy for
   citizens to access this essential evidence regardless of the location
   of the documentation or of the people using it. We hope that by
   providing electronic public access to more and more of our records and
   services, we will better meet your information needs.

   One of the goals of our Strategic Plan is to " expand current efforts
   to build a nationwide, integrated online information-delivery system
   that educates citizens about NARA and its facilities, services, and
   holdings." To do this, we have a number of projects under way,
   including this Web site. One such project is the NARA Archival
   Information Locator (NAIL), a pilot database of descriptions of various
   NARA holdings nationwide. In addition, some of the descriptions have
   links to digital copies of the documents being described. NAIL is the
   cornerstone of a larger Electronic Access Project through which we plan
   to develop an online catalog of all of our holdings nationwide.

   Among the treasures that await you here online are the cornerstone
   documents of our Government -- the Declaration of Independence, the
   Constitution of the United States, and the Bill of Rights -- as well as
   many of our current and past exhibits. But the National Archives is
   more than famous documents. NARA is a public trust upon which our
   democracy depends. We enable people to inspect for themselves the
   record of what government has done. We enable officials and agencies to
   review their actions, and we help citizens hold them accountable for
   those actions.

   I hope you will take the time to explore the resources available here
   and to learn more about our programs and services. You can also find
   out about changes we are making at NARA to improve customer service and
   implement our Strategic Plan. As part of the ongoing development of our
   information server, we value your comments and suggestions on how we
   can improve our services for you.

   Thank you for visiting the National Archives and Records
   Administration.

   JOHN W. CARLIN
   Archivist of the United States
