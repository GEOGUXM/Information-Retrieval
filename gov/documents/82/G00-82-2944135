    Laboratory Spectrometers (UV to NIR)

   Beckman 5270 spectrophotometer, custom modified in-house to control all
   functions. The system is described in Clark, R. N., King, T. V. V.,
   Klejwa, M., Swayze, G. A., Vergo, N., 1990, High spectral resolution
   reflectance spectroscopy of minerals: Journal of Geophysical Research,
   95, 12653-12680.
Wavelength Range: 0.2 to 3.0 microns,
   (computer selectable spectral resolution):
        0.2  to 0.85 microns region: 0.008 to 0.00005 microns
        0.85 to 4.00 microns region: 0.032 to 0.0003  microns

   The measurements contained in our spectral libraries were obtained with
   this system.

   This system is more than 20 years old and is being phased out and
   replaced with a new, custom-built spectrometer.

    Laboratory Spectrometers (NIR, MIR to FIR)

   Nicolet model Magna 760 FTIR spectrophotometer (new 1998). With our
   current equipment, we have the capability to measure from about 6666 to
   67 inverse cm (1.5 to 150 microns). Wavelength accuracy is ~0.1 inverse
   cm. Resolution is selectable from 0.125 to 32 inverse cm. This system
   has greater signal to noise than our older model 740 system. We also
   have more detectors, including liquid nitrogen cooled InSb, allowing
   even greater signal to noise.

   We typically measure reflectance spectra with 4 inverse cm resolution
   (sampling at 2 inverse cm).

    Laboratory Spectrometers (Mossbauer)

   Austin Science drive and electronics with a CO2Kr detector tube and 20
   millicurie Co57 source. 1024 channel analyzer.

    Sample Collection

   The complete collection of samples of Graham Hunt and Jack Salisbury
   (spectra published in Modern Geology series of papers). Approximately
   2100 samples of 400 minerals.

   Complete set of well-characterized samples from the Source Clay
   Minerals Repository, University of Missouri (26 samples).

   Complete set of Wards Scientific rocks (1000 samples), including many
   near-gem quality specimens.

   A large and growing collection of mineral samples, many of which have
   been very well characterized by specialists of specific minerals.

   Selected samples from the National Museum of Natural History and the
   British Museum.

    Computer Facilities

   We use a central business server concept with X-terminals on each
   user's desk. The laboratory spectrometers feed data in real time to the
   central machine. Users can monitor spectrometer functions and data from
   their offices or even from remote locations. Imaging spectroscopy data
   are huge. We maintain many tens of gigabytes of data, often analyzing
   many gigabytes at a time. The central server concept maintains large
   disk drives, read/write optical, and CD-ROM disk drives to store data.
   The analysis flow of huge data volumes is kept off the network. Users
   displaying images on their screens is a very small volume compared to
   the I/O requirements of imaging spectroscopy data analysis.

   We are currently using an HP 9000 K250 server with 2.6 GBytes RAM, 6
   read/write optical disks (two 1.3 Gbyte drives, two 2.6 Gbyte and two
   5.2 GByte drives), 3 CD-ROM drives, DAT DDS2, DDS3, 502 GBytes hard
   disk space. The machine has a 965 MByte/Sec backplane, and delivers
   more than 130 MFLOPS per cpu (we have 2 cpus) with our spectral
   analysis software. For comparison, it is about >4 times faster per cpu
   than a Sun Ultra II 200 MHz for our analysis software. This speed
   allows us to analyze for about 300 materials in a 614x1024-pixel
   imaging spectroscopy (NASA AVIRIS) data set in about 1 hour.

    Field Spectrometers

   We are currently using two ASD FR (0.4 - 2.5 micron) field
   spectrometers to measure samples and provide for in situ calibration of
   surface reflectance for terrestrial imaging spectroscopy studies. They
   also serve as laboratory spectrometers when rapid spectra are needed.
   In calibrating standards in the field, we usually obtain hundreds of
   spectra at a site and average them to provide an average spectrum
   similar to what the remote sensing instruments measure. We find that no
   field instrument can have the quality of a stable laboratory instrument
   because of temperature drifts and rapidly changing atmospheric
   absorptions. Thus we also obtain field samples which we measure on our
   laboratory instruments to confirm spectral details and to provide
   information for removing artifacts from the field data. This two step
   approach is our best assurance of precise spectra.

   Environment Chamber

   Our environment chamber allows cooling of samples to liquid cryogenic
   temperatures (typically liquid Nitrogen- LN[2]= 77 K) under vacuum
   conditions. Vacuum feed throughs allow frost growth and sample
   creation/manipulation. Temperature and pressure sensors monitor the
   sample and its environment. The chamber is used to simulate
   environments in the outer solar system. Spectrometers measure the
   sample from 0.4 to 2.5 microns currently, with mating to our Nicolet
   soon to allow measurement to the far-IR.
