   GENERAL INFORMATION

   [sumbul1a.gif]

   RESEARCH PROGRAM: Wide range, high brightness IR spectroscopy.
   Research within the BNL Physics Department deals with the otpical
   properties of solids, with particular emphasis on the "bad metals",
   transition-metal oxides, superconductors and other exotic systems which
   display evidence for correlated behavior.

   RING: VUV-IR port.
   [sumbul1a.gif]

   STATUS: Fully operational.
   [sumbul1a.gif]

   TIME DEDICATED TO NSLS GENERAL USER PROGRAM: 25% of operations.  NB:
   General Users are expected to understand the fundamentals of infrared
   spectroscopy, and to be familiar with modern rapid-scan
   Fourier-transform interferometers.  Beamline personnel are not
   responsible for instruction in these areas!  If you would like to learn
   more about the fundamentals of infrared spectroscopy, you can view a
   PDF file of a monograph Fourier-transform infrared spectrscopy that I
   am working on, but have not yet finished (you will need Adobe Acrobat
   Reader to view this document).

   The Bruker IFS66v/S is shown above in a reflectance configuration where
   the beam is drawn out of the instrument.  Some more pictures of the
   instrument and optics developed by the U10A PRT are shown below (click

  OPTICAL CONFIGURATION

    Beamline Optical System:

     A two mirror system (M1 and M2) collects and re-images the
     synchrotron infrared source at a point just outside of the storage
     rings UHV.  The M1 mirror is a water cooled plane mirror made from
     silicon with a gold reflective coating.  The M2 mirror is a glass
     ellipsoid with a bare aluminum reflective coating.  The ellipsoidal
     mirror focuses the beam through a 10 mm aperture wedged diamond
     window (~350 microns thick).  The delivered spectral range extends
     from approximately 10 cm^-1 to beyond 40,000 cm^-1; the beam is then
     collimated (aluminized off-axis paraboloid) to the IR spectrometer.
     The collimated beam is then refocused into the spectrometer using an
     off-axis parabolic mirror; this mirror is identical to the mirror
     used to collimate the light from the internal sources resulting in a
     symmetric arrangement, allowing the user to change back and forth
     between sources while the instrument is under vacuum without any
     loss in alignment.

    Experimental Apparatus:

     The Bruker IFS66v/S is a Fourier transform interferometer with rapid
     and step-scan options.  The instrument operates under vacuum for
     improved performance in the far and mid infrared.  There are three
     internal sources (Hg arc lamp, GLOBAR, and Tungsten lamp for the far
     infrared, mid infrared, and visible regions), as well as the
     broad-band external synchrotron source.  There are a variety of
     beamsplitters and detectors for the far infrared (4.2K Si:B
     bolometer & RT DTGS pyroelectric detectors, ~20 to 700 cm^-1), mid
     and near infrared (4.2K Si:B photoconductor, RT DTGS pyroelectric,
     and 77K InSb, ~300 to 18,000 cm^-1), visible and UV regions (Si and
     GaP diodes, 9,000 to over 28,000 cm^-1).  Instrument automation
     allows the sources, and to a lesser extent the detectors, to be
     changed while the instrument is  under vacuum.  A feature also
     exists to extract collimated beam after the beamsplitter through a
     port on the interferometer bench.

    Computer System Hardware and Software:

     The interferometer computer is an Intel Pentium 200 MHz system with
     OS/2 Warp 4 and Windows NT 4.0 operating systems in a dual-boot
     configuration.  The data acquisition system is Bruker's OPUS
     software, which runs under either OS/2 (version 3.0.2) or Windows NT
     (version 3.1).
