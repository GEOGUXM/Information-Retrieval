                                 CYBER SQUAD

   The threats handled by the San Diego DivisionÂ’s Cyber Squad are among
   the most challenging and dynamic problems that the FBI now addresses in
   meeting its national security and criminal missions. United States
   Government agencies and businesses are vulnerable to attacks that are
   designed to alter, steal, or destroy information contained in their
   computer systems. Some of the attacks are intended to disable critical
   electronic or physical networks on which our communities depend. The
   Cyber Squad works with the National Infrastructure Protection Center
   (NIPC) located at FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C., to conduct
   computer investigations. NIPC supports state-of-the-art computer
   investigations, both nationally and internationally, and includes
   representatives from many government agencies.

   The San Diego Cyber Squad also investigates the systematic infringement
   of intellectual property rights. The proliferation of computers and
   computer networks has made the illegal reproduction and distribution of
   protected material much easier than ever to accomplish. Information
   itself has become increasingly valuable and the focus of foreign
   espionage is in some instances directed to obtaining valuable
   proprietary information from United States businesses. The FBI engages
   in sophisticated investigations of certain thefts of intellectual
   property when the conduct exceeds available civil remedies.
