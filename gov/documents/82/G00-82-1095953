   Careers at the INEEL
   Diversity and Equal Opportunity
   The INEEL is committed to developing an environment where individuals
   and teams are valued and inspired to contribute fully to our success.
   We strive to be recognized by our employees and our community as a
   diversity leader. Diversity in our workforce and community is critical
   to the success of the INEEL. Continuing to develop our diversity
   initiative will expand our base of knowledge, skills, abilities and
   understanding.

   We are committed to providing a workplace free from all forms of
   discrimination, including sexual harassment and other forms of
   harassment.

    This year's Hispanic Youth Symposium (HYS) was held April 27-29, 2001.
   HYS is an annual outreach effort, which encourages Latino teens to seek
          brighter futures for themselves and their families by staying in
             school. This weekend event involves motivational speakers and
    interactive workshops. The students compete in speech, talent, art and
                     interactive competitions for awards and scholarships.

    The symposium was developed to decrease the over sixty percent dropout
       rate of Idaho's Latino students. It has since been in existence for
     over 10 years and the current dropout rate has declined, but is still
      over thirty percent. This program reaches out to students who are at
            risk of dropping out of high school and high achievers who are
           interested in college, but cannot financially afford to attend.

           HYS is a collaborative effort between public employers, federal
   management contractors, private industry, state and private educational
     institutions and Hispanic organizations throughout Idaho. Operational
    expenses for HYS are approved by the U.S. Department of Energy - Idaho
                                                        Operations Office.

   The INEEL is involved in various internal and external diversity
   programs including:
     * President's Diversity Awards - The President's Diversity Awards
       program strengthens the focus placed on our INEEL Diversity
       Initiative. The program recognizes the support of employees who
       have played a critical role in the success of the INEEL's diversity
       efforts.
     * INEEL Woman of the Year - In support of Women's History Month,
       DOE-ID, INEEL Contractors and Argonne-West sponsor the annual INEEL
       Woman of the Year Award. The award honors a woman who has made
       significant contributions in furthering the INEEL's mission, goals
       and objectives and who has made outstanding contributions to the
       community.
     * Cinco de Mayo Celebration - We provide sponsorship and volunteers
       to the Idaho Migrant Council for the annual Cinco de Mayo
       Celebration. The annual celebration is located at Tauphaus Park in
       Idaho Falls.
     * Idaho Falls Art Council Diversity Program - Support is provided to
       the Arts Council in their efforts to provide diverse entertainment
       for the community.
     * Idaho Falls Heritage Festival - Every August INEEL employees, along
       with other members of the community, volunteer their time to bring
       song, dance, history, various ethnic traditions, arts, crafts, and
       a variety of foods to Idaho Falls at Tauphaus Park. It continues to
       be a fun-filled family event.
     * Mayor's Special Emphasis Committee - The Mayor's Committee was
       established several years ago in response to the tensions between
       ethnic and religious groups in the community. The goal is to strive
       for celebration of diversities and commonalties that make our
       community richer. INEEL employees volunteer their time to serve on
       this committee.
     * Local NAACP, Provide a Trusting Hand (PATH) - We support activities
       for the NAACP throughout the year such as the Martin Luther King
       Celebration/Banquet and Black History Month.
     * Promoting a Successful Outcome (PASO) - PASO and PATH are two
       programs for Hispanic and Native American college students. The
       internships provide summer job experiences, role model interaction
       with personal mentors and self-improvement workshops.
     * Hispanic Youth Symposium (HYS).
