Older Americans and Family Caregivers to Benefit from New Administration on
Aging Budget
   _____________________________________________________________________

   HHS Assistant Secretary for Aging Josefina G. Carbonell today announced
   the Administration on Agings (AoA) $1.2 billion budget for fiscal year
   2002 signed into law by the President on Thursday, January 10, 2002.
   This budget will provide unprecedented investments in Americas older
   adults and their family caregivers.

   "AoAs programs touch people where they live in their homes and their
   communities. This budget, which is an almost 9 percent increase over
   the FY 2001 budget, provides for enhanced social support systems and
   enables us to more efficiently and effectively serve older persons as
   well as those who care for them," said Assistant Secretary Carbonell.

   Highlights of the AoAs budget, part of the Labor/Health and Human
   Services/Education Appropriations bill for FY 2002, include:
     * $141.5 million for the National Family Caregiver Support Program, a
       $16.5 million increase over last year. This program provides grants
       to states who work with area agencies on aging and community
       services providers to better serve caregivers who are struggling to
       care for their loved ones while holding jobs and juggling other
       family responsibilities. $5.5 million of this amount will support
       caregivers of Native American elders.
     * $357 million for AoAs core supportive services, an almost $32
       million increase over last year. These funds will provide seniors
       with access services, such as transportation; in-home services,
       including supportive services for families of older individuals who
       are victims of Alzheimer's disease; and community services, such as
       adult day care, legal assistance and health promotion.
     * $390 million for congregate meals, an almost $12 million increase
       over last year. These meals are served to older persons in local
       group meal settings. Also provided are ancillary nutrition
       screening, education, counseling and outreach services.
     * $176.5 million for home-delivered meals, a $24.5 million increase
       over last year. These meals are delivered to frail, ill and
       homebound elders.
