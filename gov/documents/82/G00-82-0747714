                                Space Weather

                    "Knowledge is the antidote to fear."
                            - Ralph Waldo Emerson

                          Space Weather Activities
                          Recent Geomagnetic Storms

   The Sun's activity causes large changes in the Sun's plasma and
   energetic particle populations, and these changes are responsible for
   the "space weather" that affects Earth. Space weather can impact the
   upper atmosphere and may influence long-term climate trends. The
   affects are related to CMEs, SEPs, and coronal holes, the source of
   high-speed streams. The largest storms occur when a fast CME hits Earth
   shortly after its shock arrives.

   In January 1997, for the first time, a coronal mass ejection was
   observed in real-time all the way from the Sun to its dramatic
   consequences at Earth four days later. The SOHO, Wind, POLAR, and
   GEOTAIL spacecraft were all involved. More about this event...

   Aurora australis Magnetic storms produce many noticeable effects on and
   near the Earth, including the northern and southern lights. This
   photograph (right) of the Aurora australis (Southern lights) is from
   Spacelab 3. Photo courtesy of R. Overmyer, NASA.

   Geomagnetic storms (magnetic storms on Earth due to solar activity)
   produce the awe-inspiring Aurora borealis and Aurora australis -- the
   Northern and Southern lights. However, they can also cause a variety of
   highly undesirable consequences. Electrical current surges in power
   lines, interference in the broadcast of radio, television, and
   telephone signals, and problems with defense communications are all
   associated with magnetic storms. Odd behavior in air and marine
   navigation instruments has been observed, and a compass anywhere on
   Earth is certainly affected. These storms are known to alter the
   atmospheric ozone layer. Even increased pipeline corrosion has been
   attributed to them.

   Variations over the 11-year solar cycle in the intensity of the Sun's
   electromagnetic output at some wavelengths significantly affect the
   chemistry, structure, and dynamics of the Earth's upper atmosphere.
   Longer-term solar variations may be linked to major shifts in the
   global climate.

   the leg of the Apollo 11 Lunar Module. Courtesy NASA archives.

   Major solar activity is a very serious concern in space flight.
   Communications may be disrupted. Large solar disturbances heat the
   upper atmosphere, causing it to expand and create increased drag on
   spacecraft in low orbits, shortening their orbital lifetime. Spacecraft
   could potentially tumble and burn up in the atmosphere.

   Intense SEP events contain very high levels of radiation, more than a
   million times the normal daily dose of a human on Earth. Radiation
   sickness can result when humans are outside the protective
   magnetosphere of the Earth, as in missions to the moon and to Mars.
   Monitoring of astronaut's exposure to radiation began during Project
   Mercury and has continued through the current Shuttle Program. The
   space radiation environment is very different from that found on Earth.
   More about radiation dangers to astronauts - from NASA JSC...

   High-energy solar protons can produce increased radiation in the
   atmosphere at altitudes where supersonic aircraft fly. This is
   especially true for flights over the north and south magnetic poles,
   areas unprotected by the Earth's magnetic field, where the radiation
   has direct access to the atmosphere. To reduce the risk to aircraft
   crews and passengers, and reduce risk to the aircraft, routine
   forecasts and alerts are sent through the Federal Aviation
   Administration so that a flight in potential danger can consider what
   course of action to take to minimize radiation exposure. The National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Environment Center
   (SEC) forecasts high-speed solar wind and solar particle events. SEC
   has a Space Weather Advisories page.

   The ACE Real Time Solar Wind (RTSW) experiment also produces on-line
   geomagnetic storm alerts.
