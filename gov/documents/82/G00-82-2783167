   AV Garmin (version 2.1.74)

   AV Garmin is an ArcViewextension.  Used with a Garmin GPS an either
   Waypoint+ or PCX download software or GarTrip, AV Garmin allows you to
   easily create shapefiles in ArcView. Point, Line or Polygon features
   can be created from either waypoint or track data.  Shapefiles can be
   projected into any ArcView supported format.  Read me file for this
   extension.

   Also, Cherie Klein of the USDAFS (U.S. Forest Service, Sequoia) has
   written a PDF document detailing the polygon creation.   Also, the help
   file has been updated and includes a "Quick Start" section.  If you
   have the current version, but the old help file then just download the
   new help file below.  This file goes into your $AVHOME/help
   directory.   Current Garmin users and folks interested in purchasing
   new Garmins may be interested to see the definitions of the IPX
   waterproofness ratings.  Also Garmin FAQ (frequently asked questions)
   can be seen at: http://www.garmin.com/support/faqs/ .   There is a DFG,
   Garmin GPS recommendations document to assist DFG folks who want to
   purchase new units.   Global Positioning System Status: USCG website

   Author: Isaac Oshima (ioshima@dfg.ca.gov ) avgarmin.exe (676 kb
   self-extracting & installing) (version 2.1.74).
   Last updated: September 13, 2001. 200109.13  -  Added code to detect
   the most common error: the use non-geographic decimal degrees as input
   into AV Garmin.  Also, added code to show the AV Garmin version number
   on the title bar of the dialog.
   200107.09    Updated the help file.  Includes a "Quick Start"
       section.
       200106.21    Added support for "saved" tracklogs
       200106.19    Fixed minor bug in Waypoint+ track reading code.
       Fixed major bug where MapSource is configured to output meters
       instead of feet.
       200105.09    This version has PCX option dropped but has a new
       option for newer Garmin models and the elevation data (eTrex
       Summit, Vista and GPSMap 76)   The attribute table for their
       shapefiles will have an "elevation" and a "depth" field when you
       create point shapefiles.  The attribute table will have an
       "elevation" and a "measure" field when you create a line/polyline
       shapefile.  Beta version is currently (version 2.1.60)
       200103.13    Added Florida Albers to "AV Projections" list.
       200101.01    Added code to the extension loading process to account
       for other languages other than English.  AV Garmin is NOT
       internationalized.  I have just changed code that was preventing AV
       Garmin from loading properly if your ArcView was for example in
       French.  The extension and dialogs are still presented in
       English.
       200101.31    Added code to help diagnose installation issues and
       did a minor update to the help file.
       200010.24    Improved handling of MapSource data where date / time
       strings are variable.
       200009.28    Saves your default projection selection and does not
       revert back to the DFG Teale Albers projection.
       200007.18    Ability to use the new Garmin MapSource (exported
       text) as input.
       200005.08    Fixed bug which affected users of PCX version 2.09.
       199911.10    Added Waypoint+ optional format support.  Use of
       user-created Waypoint+ format files with correct date and time in
       date/time field so that user can utilize the description field.
       199905.19    Previous installer defaulted to path of 'c:\esri\....'
       and did not allow the user to alter this path.

   AV SADI (beta version 1.0)

   Author: Isaac Oshima ioshima@dfg.ca.gov

   ArcView SADI extension for connecting to SADI datasources.  You need to
   have a SADI database as well as a SADI datasource (ODBC) and an entry
   in your dfgavx.ini file.   This is practical only if you have a current
   SADI database such as FishTrac, CalTrac, etc...

   AV Xlinx (version 1.0.88)

   ArcView Xlinx extension manages document links.  Basically, it lets you
   associate any number of documents to features of a theme.   This is
   like the current MS Access database xlinx function in applications such
   as FishTrac, CalTrac, etc...  The current version does not interface
   with the MS Access xlinx MDB structure, but this is planned.   Author:
   Isaac Oshima ( ioshima@dfg.ca.gov ) This is a beta version so has no
   help file.  Please, read / download / print the avxlinx.pdf file for
   brief instructions on using AV Xlinx.   200110.02    -    added
   functionality that can be called from the AV Sticke extension and
   perhaps other extensions as well.   200106.21    -    fixed bug that
   caused numeric field links to fail if the fields were not of type
   integer.  Now handles any field type correctly.   200104.24 - added
   code to correctly add the xlinx dbf files to $AVHOME\etc directory by
   default and correctly read the indexhome value in the dfgavx.ini file
   if xlinx dbf files are placed elsewhere; instead of the root
   directory.   avxlinx.exe (250 kb self-extracting & installing)

   AV Image Catalog (Version 2.1.6)

   DFG Image Catalog has been renamed to AV Image Catalog.  AV Image
   Catalog is an ArcView extension.  This extension helps you to create
   and maintain "image catalogs" for use within ArcView.  Image catalogs
   allow you to take any number of like images (scanned topo's, SPOT,
   etc...) and logically group them for display in ArcView as a single
   theme. Author: Isaac Oshima ( ioshima@dfg.ca.gov ) New AV Image Cat:
   avicat.exe (427 kb self extracting & installing)
   Last updated: October 16, 2001.
   200110.16  Added code so that if your icatinx.dbf file is located on a
       shared drive that is not editable, the extension will still let you
       "read" the contents, but will not be able to edit.  The previous
       version would error if it could not have "write" access and would
       not even show the image catalog correctly.
       200101.31  Changed the name of the extension from "DFG Image
       Catalog" to "AV Image Catalog".  Technical updates not listed below
       are the handling of MrSID images, updated help file, some minor
       fixes.
       200007.03  Fixed function for a single "Image Group" getting image
       files from multiple directories to create a single image catalog.
       Fixed function for deleting image catalog definitions and "Image
       Group" constituents.
       200005.08  Re-investigated the extension prompting for
       "N:\icat\icatinx.dbf".  This should not occur anymore.
       200003.03  Bug fix.  The "Apply" button was not enabled properly so
       did not allow users to enter new records / image catalog
       definitions.
       199912.23  The annoying prompt to find the "icatinx.dbf" file every
       time should be gone.  The user interface should be easier,
       especially concerning new image catalog definitions.  Lastly, core
       functions of Will's DRG Tools have been embedded.
       199911.08  Bug fix for default image extension ("tif").
       199909.23  The image catalog field, "IMAGE" length has been
       increased from 128 characters to 255.
       199905.10  Bug Fix has been incorporated into the latest
       self-extracting file.  (uninstall the old version using the
       'add/remove programs' applet in the control panel.)

   DRG-Tools (v3.5) and Image-Tools (v2.5)

   Because these two ArcView 3.x extensions have similar functions, they
   are offered here together in one download. Extension descriptions are
   provided below.

   Image-Tools (v2.5)

   This new extension provides various image-related utilities, including
   specific features for use with single-band images (such as topographic
   map scans, DRG, DOQ, NOAA chart, and other pseudocolor/color-indexed
   products) as well as multi-band images (such as true color airphotos).
   The current Image-Tools extension provides these options: * Side by
   side single-band image viewing (edgematching - making overlap
   transparent).
     * Isolate particular single-band image colors.
     * Toggle single-band image colors to transparent.
     * Display single-band image colors in grayscale.
     * Restore default image colors.
     * Display transparent single-band image colors as white.
     * Save a colormap file for the active single-band image (including
       transparent colors).
     * Load a colormap file for single-band images (including transparent
       colors).
     * Make all images visible (or all single-band images or all
       multi-band images).
     * Activate (highlight) all images (or all single-band images or all
       multi-band images).
     * Build an image catalog from images in the view.
     * Build an image catalog from images stored on disk.
     * Export views to georeferenced JPEG images (with quality and DPI
       settings).
     * Convert active single-band images to grids (transfers image colors
       to grid theme).

   Once downloaded and unzipped, please read the file "imgtools.txt" for
   further information. Check back for future updates.

   DRG-Tools (v3.5)

   This extension provides specific utilities for use with most digital
   raster graphic (DRG) images. A DRG is a scanned image of a USGS
   standard series topographic map.  The current DRG-Tools extension
   provides these options:  * Side by side DRG image viewing (edgematching
   - making the collar transparent).
     * Isolate particular DRG image features, such as contours or
       hydrography.
     * Toggle DRG image colors to/from transparent.
     * Display DRG image colors in grayscale.
     * Restore default DRG image colors.
     * Display transparent DRG colors as white.
     * Save a colormap file for the active DRG image (including
       transparent colors).
     * Load a colormap file for DRG images (including transparent colors).
     * Make all DRG images visible.
     * Activate (highlight) all DRG images.
     * Build an image catalog from DRG images in the view.
     * Convert active DRG images to grids (transfers DRG colors to grid
       theme).

   An archive of DRG-related colormap (*.clr), ArcView grid theme legend
   (*.avl), and ArcView palette files (*.avp) is also included with the
   extension download. These files can be useful for applying or restoring
   DRG image colors to your data within various ESRI software programs.
   Once downloaded and unzipped, please read the file "drgtools.txt" for
   further information. Check back for future updates.

   AV Sticke (beta version 1.081)

   The AV Sticke extension works with the freeware Palm Pilot application
   called, StickeNotes.   StickeNotes was created by Jason Pascoe and Nick
   Ryan Copyright © 1996-1999 and can be downloaded at:
   http://www.cs.ukc.ac.uk/people/staff/nsr/mobicomp/Fieldwork/Software/in
   dex.html The user manual can be found online at:
   http://www.cs.ukc.ac.uk/people/staff/nsr/mobicomp/Fieldwork/Software/Pi
   lot/OnlineManual/StickeV2UserManual.html

   The AV Sticke extension reads the hotsynced StickeNotes data from your
   Palm Pilot and creates corresponding points in an ArcView shapefile.
   The current version now interfaces with the ArcView xlinx dbf structure
   via the AV Xlinx extension.  You should make sure you have the at least
   AV Xlinx installed version 1.0.56.     It currently does not use /
   access the MS Access xlinx MDB structure, but this is planned.   Last
   updated: October 17, 2001 Author: Isaac Oshima ( ioshima@dfg.ca.gov )
   This is a beta version so has no help file.   Please, read / download /
   print the avsticke.pdf file for brief instructions on using AV
   Sticke.  There is also an additional document (scenario.pdf) describing
   the typical scenario of use and comments on AV Sticke's functions.
   avsticke.exe (475 kb self-extracting & installing)   Versions 1.0.80
   -  Added sound effects!  You can turn this off by editing the
   %AVHOME%\dfgavx.ini file; look for the [avsticke] section entry called,
   sndfx=TRUE and change this to sndfx=FALSE.  Also, there was a bug in
   the re-naming of the imge files that should now be fixed.   1.0.73  -
   This version has all known bugs removed.  I have added code to add the
   Sticke shapefile if it already exists and you do not already have it in
   the current view.   1.0.63    -    This version should be fully
   functional but still may have some bugs.  The automatic hotlinking of
   "Photolog" Sticke data table photo references now works.  You will need
   to have the most current version of AV Xlinx also installed (version
   1.0.56).  Monthly and spatial indexing now works.  Once you have chosen
   an indexing method and created your project and project shapefile, you
   should NOT change the indexing method.    1.0.29 - Added interim 'help'
   document, avsticke.pdf 1.0.26 - Continuing to add code for "project"
   based collection.  Handling of photo data nearing completion.
   Automatic hotlinking of these images to points will require your
   installation of the Xlink extension above.  Storage of images can be by
   "monthly directories" or by "spatial index" based on a polygon
   shapefile.  These are not fully completed.  If you use this extension
   right now, limit yourself to the non-photo collection StickeNotes
   templates.   1.0.10 - Added code for "project" based collection and
   processing of data.   1.0.17 - Continuing to update with "project"
   based file handling.

   Rapix (beta version 1.0.55)

   Rapix is an ArcView extension was created for the Resource Assessment
   Program (RAP). It can be use for more general projects provided the
   items in the "Required" section below are done. This extension helps
   manage location attributes collected in a single dbf table in
   association with the point locations collected with a Trimble GPS and
   processed by the Trimble PathFinder Office software. This extension
   also will process photograph "metafields" within the dbf that store
   digital image identifiers and associate given image(s) to the proper
   location in ArcView via customized hotlink. Required - You must have
   the location attribute dbf, (photo*.dbf)  This attribute dbf must be
   named such that the first five characters are, "photo". - You must have
   a Trimble shapefile (posnpnt.shp). This post differentially corrected
   file must have at least the fields: 'Max_pdop', 'Gps_date', 'Gps_time',
   and 'Datafile'. The configuration of Trimble's PathFinder Office
   determines the field(s) output to the shapefile. The name, posnpnt.shp
   is the default output shapefile name. - These files must be in one
   directory per each field session. - If collecting digital photographs
   that you want "hotlinked" to the points (feature locations); these
   photo image files must also be in this directory. - You can enter /
   collect the locational attributes on any device that you would like, as
   long as the final attribute file is a dbf. In the current development
   the device is a Compaq iPAQ with data being added to an Excel
   spreadsheet. This spreadsheet is transferred with the PC desktop /
   laptop and examined in Excel before being saved to dbf format. Please
   read the rapix_beta.txt document before using. Author: Isaac Oshima
