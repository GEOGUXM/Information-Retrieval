                               Quality Control

   Quality control is fundamental to the successful operation of any
   service that provides tissue for research. For this reason the
   principal investigators are experienced in anatomic pathology and
   actively are involved in a practice of anatomic pathology. The
   principal investigators, who are responsible for proper
   histopathological characterization, participate in research and
   understand the importance of quality control in the tissues provided.

   All specimens are subject to an immediate gross examination by a
   pathologist. The diagnosis is then verified through frozen section,
   touch preparations, or subsequent evaluation of permanent
   histopathology. In most cases, the diagnosis can be assured before the
   specimen is released to the investigator. However, in some cases in
   which fresh specimens are needed, the tissues are provided to the
   investigator with a preliminary diagnosis, and the investigator is
   informed of the final diagnosis as soon as this information is
   available. In all divisions and institutions affiliated with the CHTN
   pathological diagnosis and patient care have total priority over the
   use of any specimen in research.

   AT NO TIME WILL THE PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS OF A SPECIMEN BE COMPROMISED
   TO OBTAIN TISSUE FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES.

   A feedback form or postcard is enclosed in each shipment, giving the
   investigator an opportunity to provide rapid information concerning the
   quality of that particular shipment. This information provides the
   divisions quick feedback and highlights any problems so they can be
   corrected immediately. A more detailed questionnaire is sent annually
   to investigators who receive tissue from the CHTN. The information
   collected in this annual evaluation will be used to identify positive
   features that should be maintained as well as problems that will be
   corrected.
