   NEW: The symposium talk transparencies are now available on the Web,
   from the Symposium page.

   As we approach the millennium, cosmology couldn't be more exciting. We
   are entering an era of precision cosmology, where an avalanche of data
   will confront theoretical ideas born of the the inner space/outer space
   connection. Foremost of these ideas is inflation. It appears likely
   that within a few years the key tenets of inflation will be tested. We
   feel that time is ripe for a meeting devoted to inflation, and have
   organized the Pritzker Symposium and Workshop on the Status of
   Inflationary Cosmology. The city of Chicago agreed with us: Its Project
   Millennium, a year-long program to celebrate and to reflect upon the
   millennium, will have its official beginning with the opening of the
   new Pritzker Gallery of Cosmology at the Adler Planetarium and our
   Symposium. This meeting will provide an overview of major developments
   in cosmology of relevance to the inflationary universe scenario, as
   well as a forum for recent theoretical and observational results.
