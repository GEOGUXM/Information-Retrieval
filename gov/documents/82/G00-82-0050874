                              What is the EHRP?

   The Department of Health and Human Services Program Support Center
   (PSC) is working in conjunction with the DHHS Agencies to implement the
   Enterprise Human Resources and Payroll (EHRP) system. This system was
   previously named the Enterprise Human Resources and Planning System.

   The EHRP is a web-based system that will replace the existing IMPACT
   (Improved Management of Personnel Administration through Computer
   Technology) system. The Departments current Central Pay System will
   remain in use and will receive data feeds from the EHRP.

   The initial version of the EHRP will contain core functionality
   common to the DHHS and the Agencies, and will gradually be enhanced by
   the PSC over the years. DHHS Personnel Offices will use the EHRP core
   to process personnel action requests (e.g., promotions, reassignments)
   and employee benefits such as life and health insurance. The EHRP will
   be implemented at the NIH in June 2002.
