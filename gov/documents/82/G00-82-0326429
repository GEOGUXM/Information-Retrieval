   Letter Requesting Information Concerning Kenneth Lay's Enron Stock
   Transactions

                              January 24, 2002

   Mr. Kenneth L. Lay
   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
   Enron Corporation
   1400 Smith Street
   Houston, Texas 77002
   Dear Mr. Lay:

   We are writing to you to gather additional information concerning your
   Enron stock transactions. We are aware that all public sales of stock
   must be reported in the following month of such sales. According to
   these reports, during the past three years, you exercised stock options
   and then sold stock for a profit of about $205 million. However, these
   public reports do not include sales of stock back to Enron, which would
   be used to pay personal loans. A report on sales of stock back to the
   company is not required until February 14.

   An article in the New York Times, dated January 22, 2002, describes in
   general terms these transactions, based upon statements by your
   attorney. That article states:

     Mr. Lay had a $4 million revolving line of credit from Enron, which
     Mr. Silbert said was raised to $7.5 million at some point in 2001.
     He said that Mr. Lay took out money from that loan, and then repaid
     it, on 15 separate occasions from February through October.

     In each case, he repaid it by turning over stock to Enron. He
     appears to have obtained some of those shares by exercising options,
     while in other cases he returned shares he already owned. Mr.
     Silbert said Mr. Lay took out the loans from the company when he
     expected that he was likely to face margin calls from other lenders.

     If those 15 repayments averaged $4 million, then they totaled $60
     million, which would represent the value of stock he returned to the
     company. Mr. Silbert declined to give exact figures, and formal
     disclosure of the transactions is not required by Securities and
     Exchange Commission rules until Feb. 14.

   We are concerned about the unreported nature of these transactions and
   their effect upon Enron shareholders and employees, particularly during
   the stocks steep decline in 2001.

   We request that you provide our Committee with a detailed listing of
   all loan transactions involving you, Jeff Skilling, Andrew Fastow,
   Michael Kopper, Rick Buy, Rick Causey, and any other senior executive
   with your company during 2001. (We understand that you have resigned
   your position as chairman and chief executive of Enron. With respect to
   questions relating to other Enron executives, please forward this
   letter to your successor in the corporation to respond.) The
   information should include:

    1. the date and amount of each loan to you by Enron;
    2. for each repayment of the loan:

    a. the date of the repayment;
    b. the amount of the repayment;
    c. if the repayment was in the form of stock, the amount of shares and
       the value assigned to each share of stock for the purpose of
       repayment of your loans.

    3. Please describe the extent to which the Enron Board of Directors
       was made aware of any loans or repayments.

   Although as we noted, public disclosure of these transactions is not
   required until February 14, we are in the midst of an intensive
   investigation of the demise of the company. We request that this
   information be provided to the Committee no later than January 28,
   2002. If you have any questions, please contact David Cavicke of the
   Committee majority staff at (202) 225-2927, or Edith Holleman of the
   minority staff at (202) 226-3400.

                                 Sincerely,


   W. J. "BILLY" TAUZIN
