                            Security Liquidations

   Purpose: The security liquidation process is the disposal or
   liquidation of obligations, including bonds, notes or other securities
   acquired by the Secretary of the Treasury for the United States
   Government or delivered to the Secretary by an Executive Agency.  It is
   the Secretarys responsibility to liquidate the securities.  Through
   redelegation authorities, this process is accomplished by the Bureau of
   the Public Debt, Office of Public Debt Accounting, Financial Accounting
   Branch.

   Obligations are usually the result of debt collection efforts.
     * Internal Revenue Service (IRS) levy
     * Bankruptcy, Settlement or Other Litigation
     * Donations to the United States Government

   Address: Securities must be mailed by registered mail or special
   messenger.  See our address.
   Proceeds: After the sale, the Financial Accounting Branch will notify
   the originating agency of the proceeds amount.  All proceeds will be
   credited to the agencys Agency Location Code.  Any security dividends
   received, or additional shares of securities received as a result of a
   stock split, will be liquidated and credited to the Agency Location
   Code.

   If the Financial Accounting Branch is unable to liquidate the security
   after a reasonable time, it will be returned along with an explanation
   to the originating agency.
