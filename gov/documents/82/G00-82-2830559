   [dot_clear.gif] The Commercial Building Systems Group explores
   different ways to integrate the efforts of the other Program groups
   (windows, lighting and simulations) with the goal of developing
   coherent and innovative building construction and design techniques.
   The Group focuses on the development of advanced computer-based
   building design tools that assist the architect or engineer in decision
   making from early, schematic design through building construction,
   commissioning and operation. In the spirit of the Healthy or Green
   Building, the Group also seeks ways to integrate a variety of isolated
   building technologies into complete systems that allow for compounded
   energy efficiency and an increased building life-cycle.
