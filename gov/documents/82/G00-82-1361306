   Menu List The Cassini spacecraft, on its journey to Saturn, made a
   flyby of the giant planet Jupiter. The Galileo spacecraft has been
   exploring Jupiter since 1995. It is unusual in the history of space
   exploration to have two robotic spacecraft on separate missions,
   actively observing a planet - other than Earth - at the same time from
   such close range. Also exciting is that elementary, middle and high
   school students had the opportunity to participate in this distinctive
   event by observing Jupiter between November 2000 and February 2001,
   using ground-based radio antennas through the Goldstone Apple Valley
   Radio Telescope (GAVRT) Project.
