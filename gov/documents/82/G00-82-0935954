   The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), one
   of the National Institutes of Health, has launched a Health Awareness
   Campaign, Oral Health, Cancer Care, and You: Fitting the Pieces
   Together. The Campaign addresses the fact that nearly one-third of
   cancer patients undergoing radiation and chemotherapy or bone marrow
   transplants are susceptible to oral complications that may compromise
   or even stop their treatment. The campaign materials are available
   through the National Oral Health Information Clearinghouse, an
   information dissemination service of NIDCR
