   Low-Emittance and Solar-Control Glazing

   Low-emittance coatings have a high reflectance in the thermal infrared
   supressing infrared radiation transfer thereby imparting additional
   thermal insulation. In 20 years low-emittance coatings have moved from
   a laboratory phenomenon to a mainstream building product. Substantial
   savings in energy have already resulted. A significant degree of solar
   control can be built into these coatings through reflectance across the
   solar spectrum or in the solar infrared alone.

   Our research fall into 3 areas: new materials, production processes,
   and characterization. There are a number of materials that have
   intrinsic selectivity. We have been able to produce several of these
   materials, but in order to impart the desired properties they must be
   deposited in crystalline form. Ordinarily this would require the use
   of  temperatures higher than practical for window glass. In many cases
   plasma energy can be substituted for thermal energy. Plasma sources
   developed at LBNL are suitable for this task. We also perform a wide
   range of analytical sercives for coating developers. Optical
   characterization of glazing products is an everyday operation in
   support of the NFRC rating and labeling process.
