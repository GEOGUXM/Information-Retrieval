                           LinkWinds Screen Dumps

   LinkWinds can save hardcopy of the rendered portion of an application,
   the entire window of an application, or the full screen. Screen dumps
   from actual LinkWinds sessions are shown below. Additional screen dumps
   and descriptions are found in the papers section.

   (129 kbytes) LinkWinds session to explore upper atmospheric ozone and
   water vapor measured by the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard UARS.

   Earth 2 encounter in December 1992 and displayed in real time.

   More views of the MLS data. Ozone and water vapor are shown in the two
   Images at top, with blue denoting low concentration and red high. The
   data is at 21.54 millibars, as determined by the slider. At lower left,
   a polar plot with lighting turned on and both color and elevation
   indicating ozone vividly shows the southern hemisphere ozone hole. The
   Scatterplot at lower center shows the anticorrelation of ozone and
   water vapor inside the boxed region of Image1. Isoview, at lower right,
   shows the distribution of two isovalues of ozone.

   (253 kbytes) LinkWinds session showing a variety of applications and
   data types. The main LinkWinds menu is on the left, with the data sets
   used placed above. Clockwise from the data objects: Part of an image of
   Venus, data from Magellan in PDS format. Ozone concentration displayed
   on Globe, with the southern hemisphere ozone hole the blue feature at
   bottom. Data is in HDF format, and is from the Microwave Limb Sounder
   aboard UARS. Landsat image of Deadman's Butte, Wyoming, mapped onto the
   elevation data and displayed on Plane. Oxygen content of the oceans, at
   sea level, shown on Image. The depth profile at the red crosshair is
   shown in LinePlot to the left.

                            LinkWinds Animations

   LinkWinds provides two tools which produce animations, one time based
   and the other frame based. The animations may be viewed immediately on
   the screen or saved to disk for later replay.

   [uars56movie1.jpg]
   (97.6 kbytes) Click on the image to the left for an mpeg animation
   (97.6 kb) made from images saved by the LinkWinds time-based animator.
   The data are ozone concentration at 21.54 mb as measured by the
   Microwave Limb Sounder from day 56 of the Upper Atmosphere Research
   Satellite mission. Red represents high ozone concentration and blue
   low. The southern hemisphere ozone hole is clearly visible.

                                 VRML Output

   The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is a standard language for
   describing 3D objects which may be delivered via the Web. LinkWinds has
   the ability to save several of its 3D applications as VRML files. These
   currently are Globe, Plane, and Polar. The VRML files are saved with a
   ".wrl" extension (for world) and are in the VRML 1.0 specification.
   Browsers and plug-ins for viweing these files are available from the
   VRML Repository.

   [uars56movie1.jpg]
   (1.96 Mbytes)
   Gzipped file also available. Click on the image to the left for a VRML
   world (1.96 Mb) or below it for a gzipped version (450 kb). This data
   is the MLS ozone data described above in the animations section. Once
   downloaded, the view may be manipulated in 3D space using an
   appropriately enabled browser.
