                        TPSX Analysis Programs Online
   _______________________________________________________________________

   As part of the overall TPSX project, researchers in Code ASM are
   working to bring TPS analysis tools to the Web. It is our goal to make
   performing routine and tedious thermal analyses, of TPS materials and
   systems, as easy as surfing the Web. Currently only a simple
   atmospheric properties program is available, but we soon plan to have
   reentry trajectory heating predictions and 1-D thermal/ablation
   analyses online!

          This program produces a table of atmospheric air properties for
          any given altitude.
