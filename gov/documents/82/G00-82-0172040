    Welcome to the parents page of the Earth to Orbit Engineering Design
    Challenges. We are glad that your child is participating in the Earth
    to Orbit Design Challenge Program.

    The Earth to Orbit Program has been created to help students

      * Increase their interest in and motivation to study science,
        mathematics, engineering and technology
      * Attain higher levels of achievement in science, mathematics,
        engineering, and technology

    These Engineering Design Challenges help children:

      * Understand a problem and design a solution
      * Work as part of a team
      * Build a model based on a design
      * Document a design in writing
      * Test a model design
      * Observe carefully
      * Record the results of testing
      * Improve a design based on test results
      * Identify relevant features that make a design better
      * Communicate the results and the process of your work to others

    How to help your child get more out of this activity:

      * Encourage your child to explain the design challenge work to you.
      * Ask what was interesting about the challenge.
      * Ask about the design solution your child's team came up with.
