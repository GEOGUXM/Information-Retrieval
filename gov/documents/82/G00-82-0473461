   Our Mission: The mission of the staff in the NRCS East Regional Office
   is to provide regional leadership, in a partnership effort, to help the
   people of the Northeast conserve, improve and sustain our natural
   resources and the environment.

   Our Vision:
   We are a valued and effective Conservation Partnership Team doing all
   we can to create harmony between the people and the land in the
   Northeast.

   W
   elcome to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) East
   Regional Office. We very much appreciate and applaud your interest in
   conservation. The NRCS, which is part of the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture, is the federal agency responsible for conservation of
   natural resources on private lands. Working in partnership with
   Conservation Districts, State conservation agencies, and Resource
   Conservation and Development Councils, NRCS assists private land users
   in the development and implementation of conservation plans that
   promote a healthy and sustainable environment. The NRCS is committed to
   providing high quality conservation technical assistance by working
   hand-in-hand with the American people to conserve natural resources on
   private lands, and to foster an understanding and appreciation of how
   natural resource systems relate to each other and to all of us. The
   East Region is one of six Regional Offices of NRCS across the country
   that is working to make conservation on private lands a reality. To
   provide us with your comments or for more information on the work we
   do, please visit the rest of our web site or feel free to contact us at
   eastregion@ea.nrcs.usda.gov. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity
   to bring conservation into your home and we look forward to working
   with you!
