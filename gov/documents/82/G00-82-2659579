   ATDD has been collaborating with the NOAA/ARL Solar Radiation Research
   Branch (SRRB) in establishing and operating the national Integrated
   Solar Irradiance Study (ISIS) network. The program is comprised of two
   "levels" of station sophistication: Level 1 provides basic measurements
   of incoming radiation only, while the more complex Level 2 sites focus
   on the overall surface radiation balance. The data are collected daily
   via dialup connection, checked for quality, and reported to NOAA's
   National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for archival. Data for the last 30
   days are also made available on our Web site.

   ISIS Radiation Monitoring
   The Air Resources Laboratory operates the NOAA broadband solar
   radiation network for both visible and ultraviolet (UV-B) light. The
   Intergrated Solar Irradiance Study operates two levels of sites
   scattered around the United States.

   Surface Flux Parameterizations for Global Climate and Change Models
   The coarse grid scales used for efficient computation by global scale
   circulation and climate models generally require very simple
   parameterizations of the near-surface planetary boundary layer, with
   the result that some important processes are not well-described. ATDD
   has collaborated in an effort to produce a better representation of
   these processes for global models.

   Oak Ridge Climate Data
   ATDD has measured climatological data variables in Oak Ridge for more
   than 50 years; the data are now available electronically.
