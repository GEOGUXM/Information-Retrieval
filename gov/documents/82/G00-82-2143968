   About the NEPP Electronic Parts (EPAR) Project
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Electronic Parts Project (EPAR) objectives are intrinsically tied
   to satisfying the needs of NASA programs/projects for evaluation of
   newly available and advanced electronic parts and maximizing
   effectiveness and efficiency through leveraging by teaming and
   partnering with industry and other agencies. The Electronic Parts
   Project will embrace the performance requirements as outlined in the
   NEPP Program Plan. The four NEPP Program Objectives are:
    1. Assess the reliability of newly available electronic parts and
       packaging technologies for usage on NASA projects through
       validations, assessments and characterizations and the development
       of test methods/tools.
    2. Expedite infusion paths for advanced (emerging) electronic parts
       and packaging technologies by evaluations of readiness for
       manufacturability and project usage consideration.
    3. Provide NASA Projects with technology selection, application, and
       validation guidelines for electronic parts and packaging hardware
       and processes.
    4. Retain and disseminate electronic parts and packaging assurance,
       reliability validations, tools and availability information to the
       NASA community.
