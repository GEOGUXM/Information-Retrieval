   This web site provides teachers, students and the interested public
   with the latest information about auroral science, and the study of
   Earth's magnetic field.

   The goal of the IMAGE mission's education and public outreach program
   (POETRY) is to:
     * Re-write the textbooks about what causes aurora.
     * Update K-12 descriptions of Earth's magnetic field and its systems
       of particles.
