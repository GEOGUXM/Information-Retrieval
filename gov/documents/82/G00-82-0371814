   Aircrew Performance


   [agars1.jpg] Conducts research to quantify, analyze, and predict
   performance of operators of the National Airspace System (NAS) under a
   wide variety of laboratory and field conditions, with a primary
   emphasis on general aviation (GA) flight crews. This human factors
   research is focused on obtaining objective, scientifically derived data
   which will aid in identifying affordable initiatives for enhancing
   pilot performance and reducing the number of accidents and incidents in
   the GA community.

   Advanced, high-fidelity flight simulators are used to:

        * investigate pilot/control display design problems associated with
          the use of advanced technologies;
        * develop pilot performance data under specified conditions as a
          means of evaluating pilot capabilities for use in certification and
          regulation; and
        * evaluate the relative effectiveness of aviation training aids and
          devices and their proper integration with existing instructional
          systems.

   Current Projects

        * Human factors aircraft certification
        * Cockpit display innovations
        * Assessment of PC-based aviation training devices
