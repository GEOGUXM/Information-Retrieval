                               SECURITY NOTICE

   OCRWM recently removed technical information and documents from its
   Internet site. This decision reflected an awareness of the need to
   protect the public following the September 11th terrorist attacks and
   the need to inform the public through an open process. Although the
   information was not accessible on the Internet, it remained available
   to the public upon request. We are working diligently to incrementally
   repost information on the Internet. If specific documents in which you
   are interested are not yet re-posted, call our toll-free information
   line at 1-(800) 225-6972 for information on receiving them.
