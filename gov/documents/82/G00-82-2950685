   Each year the Commission is charged with setting policy for Commission
   action and selecting priority issues for its public education and
   legislative program activities. In its 36 year history, the Commission
   has examined and supported public policy development in many areas of
   concern to California women and their familiesÂ–civil rights; sex equity
   in education; discrimination in employment, insurance, and credit;
   sexual harassment; domestic violence and sexual assault, access to
   health care; reproductive freedom; child and other dependent care; pay
   inequities and comparable worth; legal rights of women in marriage and
   divorce; social security and pensions.

     * For the year 2001 the Commission has identified "Issues of the
       Underserved" as a top priority with specific emphasis on Women in
       Prison.
     * Other key issues which the Commission will continue to examine
       include: Equity (Civil Rights, Equal Access to Education &
       Employment Opportunities) Economic Autonomy (Pay Equity, Family
       Law, Health Care and the Preservation of Reproductive Freedom,
       Child & Other Dependent Care, Protection and Support for Victims of
       Violence, Welfare Reform).
