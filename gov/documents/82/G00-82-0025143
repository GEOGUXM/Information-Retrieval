     is provided, the District can fill these out. However, you MUST
     complete line 14.

     When you complete line 14, include only operation that may be
     anticipated (operation for testing, maintenance and operation during
     voluntary blackouts where the site is blacked out under a prior
     agreement with the local utility) but do not include operation under
     general blackout conditions, which cannot be anticipated.

     Notes on RSA form:
     All information requested on this form MUST be completed or
     provided. If any information is missing, then the application will
     not be able to be processed. Especially note that a map, showing
     your site and surrounding residences and businesses, is required in
     Section C.  For more information about the District's review of
     Toxics from diesel engines, please see the Risk Management Policy
     for Diesel Engines.
