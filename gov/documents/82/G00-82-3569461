     * License Fee (This is the fee that may be an income tax deduction)
     * Weight Fee
     * Special Plate Fee

   The penalties when paying annual registration fees late.

   California does not offer a grace period after your vehicle's
   registration expiration date. Be sure to pay your renewal fees on or
   before the date of expiration shown on your current registration card.
   Even though your plates have only the month and year, your registration
   expires on a specific day. Be sure and check the registration card for
   the actual day of expiration.

   Penalty fees on expired registration are:
     * 10% if 1-10 days late
     * 20% if 11-30 days late
     * 60% if 31 days-1 year late

   If your registration is expired more than 1 year, the penalty fees will
   be:
     * 60% for the first year
     * 80% for the second year
     * 160% for the third year

   Collections for delinquent registration and dishonored checks are
   handled by the Franchise Tax Board.

   Non-operation for a vehicle not being used.

   If you do not plan to drive your vehicle during the next renewal year,
   and the vehicle will not be parked where it may be subject to citations
   such as a street, you may complete a Certificate of Planned
   Non-operation (REG 102), also called a PNO. There is a $10 filing fee
   for the PNO.

   The filing fee may be paid up to 60 days prior to the expiration date
   without penalties. If you file up to 90 days after the expiration date,
   you will be liable for penalties on the full registration amount.

   If at any time the vehicle is operated or parked where it may be
   subject to citation, then full registration fees and penalties for that
   year become due.

   You can mail the completed PNO along with a check or money order for
   $10 to:

   Disabled person placards and plates.

   You may be eligible for a disabled person plate and/or parking placard
   if you are permanently disabled. Temporary parking placards are
   available to individuals with temporary disabilities. These are valid
   for up to 6 months. A doctor's certification is required for persons
   whose mobility is impaired due to:
     * Cardiovascular (heart or circulatory) disease
     * Pulmonary (lung) disease
     * A diagnosed disease or disorder which significantly limits the use
       of lower extremities
     * Specific visual problems including low-vision or partial-sight
     * Loss, or the loss of the use of, one or both lower extremities or
       of both hands. A doctor's certification is not required if there is
       a loss of a lower extremity or both hands, if the person appears in
       person at the DMV office.

   Permanent parking placards expire every odd-numbered year on June
   30^th. There is no fee to renew and a doctor's certification is not
   required. Owners are sent a renewal notice and may return the notice to
   DMV by mail.

   To apply for a permanent or temporary placard:
     * Complete a Application for Disabled Person Parking Placard or
       Plates (Reg.195).
     * Include the doctor's statement certifying your disability.
     * Include a check or money order for $6 if requesting a temporary
       parking placard. There is no fee for a permanent placard or plates.
     * Mail the application to the address on the form.

   Disabled person privileges and parking spaces are often abused. Much of
   the abuse results from a poor understanding of placard requirements and
   privileges. The only legal use of a placard is by the person it is
   issued to. They do not have to own or drive the vehicle to use the
   placard. It is illegal to:
     * Lend your placard to another person
     * Use another person's placard
     * Forge a doctor's signature
     * Provide false information to obtain a placard
     * Alter a placard or placard identification card

          may wish to submit more than one choice, in case your first
          selection is not available.
          DMV has the right to refuse any combination of letters and
          numbers that may be considered offensive to good taste and
          decency, or which could be misleading, or conflict with any
          license plate series now issued.

   Fees
          The fee for personalized plates is $41, with a $25 annual
          renewal fee added to your registration fees.
          To transfer your personalized plates to a different vehicle, you
          will need to complete a reassignment form and pay a $20
          processing fee.

   See the Special Interest License Plates website for information about
   the various plates and what they look like. You can also check the
   environmental license plate (ELP) database to find out if a specific
   personalized configuration has been taken.

   information and the various fees.

   Off highway vehicles (OHV) subject to off-road registration.

   OHVs are vehicles such as racing motorcycles, trail bikes, mini bikes,
   dune buggies, all-terrain vehicles, jeeps and snowmobiles. These
   vehicles are operated exclusively off public roads and highways on
   lands that are open and accessible to the public. They do not require
   regular registration, but must display an identification plate or
   device issued by DMV.

   It is not necessary to register a vehicle for both on-highway and
   off-highway use. Valid on-highway registration allows the vehicle to be
   operated on and off the highway. Vehicles registered for on-highway use
   only may be subject to a "use fee" if operated in OHV parks.

   To change a California registered vehicle from on-highway use to OHV,
   you will need to:
     * Visit a DMV office (make an appointment for faster service)
     * Provide the California Certificate of Title
     * Pay the $20 registration fee

   To register an OHV that has never been registered and was purchased
   from someone other than a licensed California dealer, you will need to:
     * Visit a DMV office (make an appointment for faster service)
     * Complete an Application for Registration (REG 343)
     * Have a DMV representative, licensed vehicle verifier or peace
       officer complete a Verification of Vehicle form Reg. 31.
     * Provide evidence of ownership such as a bill of sale, out-of-state
       title, or Manufacturer's Certificate of Origin
     * Surrender any on-highway license plates
     * Pay the $20 registration fee
     * Pay the use tax

   Fees for original and renewal registrations are $20 for 2 years and
   expire on June 30^th of the second year. Renewal notices are mailed to
   owners. A penalty fee of $10 is due if the renewal is late.

   website for additional information and the Green Sticker Vehicle
   Newsletter.

   Requirements after selling a vehicle.

   When selling a California registered vehicle, the registered owner of
   record must:
     * Release ownership by signing on line one of the title.
       If the vehicle is, or was financed, a name will be in the legal
       owner section and their releasing signature is required on line
       two.
     * Provide the purchaser with evidence of a valid smog certification.
       Smog certificates are good for 90 days from the date of inspection.
       The smog certification is not required if the owner or buyer sign a
       statement that a smog certificate was submitted with renewal fees
       within 60 days prior to the transfer date.
     * Provide the odometer mileage if the vehicle is less than 10 years
       old.
       If the title does not have a designated space for this information,
       an Odometer Disclosure Certification (REG 262) must be signed by
       both the seller and buyer. The REG 262 cannot be copied, an
       original must be submitted. You can call (916) 657-7669 between the
       hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. and ask for one to be mailed to you, or
       pick one up from your local DMV.
     * Complete a Notice of Release of Liability (REG 138) and mail the
       notice to the DMV address on the form. The seller is responsible
       for reporting the change of ownership to DMV within 5 days from the
       date of sale. It is important to do this as soon as possible,
       because after DMV updates the information from the REG 138, you
       will be cleared from future liability on the vehicle. The purchaser
       is responsible for reporting the change of ownership to DMV within
       10 days from the date of purchase.

   How to stop receiving renewal notices for a car you sold, no longer own
   or if you moved out of state.

   For a vehicle you no longer own, most likely, DMV did not receive a
   Notice of Release of Liability (REG 138) following the sale of your
   vehicle or perhaps the information was not complete filled transfer
   date was missing. Another notice will need to be submitted.

   A Notice of Release of Liability must be completed not only when the
   vehicle is sold, but also if it is given away or donated.

   Registration renewal notices are computer generated more than 60 days
   prior to the expiration date. Occasionally, these renewal notices are
   generated within days of the sale of your vehicle, and the documents
   may cross in the mail.

   If this occurs, complete another release of liability form or submit a
   copy of your original notice of release of liability along with your
   renewal notice and DMV will update the information. You can mail it to
   the address on the form.

   If you have moved out of California and received a renewal notice, on
   the notice write that you are no longer living in California and mail
   it back to DMV. Your record will be updated with the new information,
   when DMV receives the notice.

   California registration fees are due and payable upon receipt of the
   registration renewal billing notice, which is mailed out approximately
   67 days before the expiration date. The expiration date is not a due
   date. It is the last day to renew without penalty.

   If a vehicle is taken out of California before the beginning of the
   renewed registration period, you may be entitled to a refund. To apply
   for a refund, complete an Application for Refund form ADM 399. You may
   mail the completed application to the address on the form.

   A refund is not due if you paid the registration fees and then sold the
   vehicle before the expiration date. Any adjustment of the fees is an
   issue to be addressed between the buyer and seller when establishing
   the selling price of the vehicle.

   Definition of a lien sale.

   If a person has repaired, furnished supplies or materials, towed or
   stored a vehicle AND has not been paid for the services rendered, that
   person has a lien against the vehicle. The lien arises at the time the
   registered owner is presented with a written statement of charges for
   completed work or services.

   If the vehicle is towed by a public agency or private towing company,
   the lien arises when the vehicle is towed or transported. The lien may
   be satisfied by selling the vehicle through the lien sale process.

   To conduct a lien sale, the person/lienholder must have possession of
   the vehicle and have lien sale authorization from DMV. Interested
   parties, including the registered and legal owners of record will be
   notified before the sale occurs.

   If the vehicle's value is $4,000 or less, the registered and legal
   owners of record will be notified by the party conducting the lien. If
   the vehicle's value is greater than $4,000, DMV notifies all interested
   parties.

   What to do after your insurance company settles your accident claim and
   you keep the vehicle.

   You must apply for a salvage certificate from the DMV when you retain
   possession after a total loss settlement. If the vehicle is inoperable,
   file a certificate of planned non-operation to avoid penalties.

   To apply for a salvage certificate, you will need to:
     * Visit a DMV office (Make an appointment for faster service)
     * Complete an application for salvage certificate
     * Surrender the title and license plates
     * Pay a $3 fee within 10 days

   When the vehicle is ready to be reregistered, DMV will require:
     * A completed application for registration
     * A salvage certificate
     * A verification of the vehicle, for which there is a $50 fee
     * Official brake and light adjustment certificates

   The Vehicle Verification is done by the CHP upon referral from DMV.
   There is a $50 fee, which must be paid to the DMV before you will be
   referred for verification. When a new title is issued, it will contain
   a notation identifying the vehicle as a salvage vehicle.
