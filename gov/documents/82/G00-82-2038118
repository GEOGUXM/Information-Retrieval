   LABORATORY FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL PHYSICS Code 692 D. Aaron Roberts and
   Melvyn L. Goldstein New Views of Magnetic Fields in the Heliosphere *
   We found, using a 3-D magnetohydrodynamic simulation code, that the
   standard "Parker" spiral interplanetary magnetic field is significantly
   modified in the region near the ecliptic where the field changes
   polarity (at a "sector boundary"). * Due to flows induced by the
   magnetic field changes across the boundary, the transition in the field
   is not a simple change in sign, and the fields in the two sectors are
   connected. This is not a dynamical "reconnection" process, but an
   unexpected steady state configuration that may also be relevant in the
   solar corona and the Earth's magnetosphere. * Comparisons with Helios
   data show that the code produces realistic detailed time series, and
   thus will provide a powerful quantitative means for studying
   heliospheric dynamics. * Knowledge of the topological connectedness of
   field lines will be important for "space weather" studies, in
   particular for determining the paths of energetic particles coming from
   the Sun. Roberts and Goldstein Code 692 The left image shows simulated
   field lines (yellow and red), with loops. The blue region on the green
   sphere indicates the region of the "sector boundary" between magnetic
   polarities. Magnetic field time series from a point in the simulation
   are shown in the upper right, with Helios data shown below right. 7 AU"
