   Santa Gets Cleared For Christmas Flight


   Kris Kringle, d.b.a. Santa Claus, got the green light today from the
   U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to engage in air travel to
   various points throughout the United States the night of Dec. 24-25.

   An order granting a flight certificate and signed by U.S.
   Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said that Santa Claus was
   Aexceptionally fit, joyfully willing and uniquely able to engage in the
   interstate air transportation for which he has requested a certificate.
   The Secretary added that Santa has a 100 percent on-time arrival
   record, having never failed to deliver all of his toys by Christmas
   morning.

   In his application, Santa Claus described himself as a citizen of the
   world residing at the North Pole who performs a vital and specialized
   transportation service.  AThe points to be served are the dwelling
   places of good girls and boys, as well as adults of goodwill,
   throughout the United States, Claus said in his application.

   The applicant notes that his operating proposal will meet the air
   service requirements of countless small communities, and also will
   serve the major transportation hubs in all regions.

   Santa Claus also told DOT that his sleigh will be powered by eight tiny
   reindeer, with the addition of a possible ninth reindeer with a special
   air navigation warning light in its nose, in the event of fog or heavy
   snow.

   Finally, the applicant, aware of the departments heightened security
   concerns, states that he has personally packed all his bags and has
   kept them in his sight for months.  He also vouches for his trusted
   elves, who lovingly prepared the contents and carefully handled the
   packing as they have done for centuries without incident.   Santa also
   says that he has a sky marshal of sorts aboard.  He has asked his lead
   reindeer, Rudolph, to stay especially alert, especially for the
   presence of nearby aircraft.

   The department said that no one has opposed the application, and Mr.
   Claus disclosed several million letters of support from children
   everywhere.  AIn these circumstances, it appears that a grant of the
   applicant=s request is in the highest public interest, the department
   said.
