   The BLISS spectrometer was built at JPL and flown in a series of 12
   balloon flights from 1983 through 1992. This instrument uses TDL
   absorption over a pathlength of up to 1 km defined by a retroreflector
   lowered below the balloon gondola. BLISS has provided measurements of
   NO[2], NO, and HNO[3] for studies of the partitioning of active
   nitrogen in the stratosphere, in addition to producing measurements of
   other gases such as HCl, CH[4], O[3], N[2]O, CO, and CO[2]. Its ability
   to measure photochemically-active species such as NO and NO[2] at any
   time of day, coupled with the open-path sampling geometry and IR
   spectroscopic detection through laser absorption, makes it a sensitive,
   non-invasive means of in situ measurement specifically suited to
   NO[2].  In the lower atmosphere, these in situ measurements were
   critical to establishing the repartitioning of reactive nitrogen due to
   heterogeneous processing on background sulfate aerosol.

   A significant achievement of the BLISS flight series was the recording
   of the diurnal variation in NO[2], covering a full cycle through both
   sunrise and sunset transitions (Webster et al., 1990). With
   simultaneous measurement of O[3] concentrations, the measured
   night-time decay in NO[2] abundance was used to model the formation of
   N[2]O[5] during the night through the NO[2]+NO[3]+M reaction.
