   Lake Okeechobee is the "liquid heart" of South Florida.  It is a large,
   shallow lake located in south-central Florida.  The lake has a surface
   area of 730 square miles and is relatively shallow, with an average
   depth of 9 feet (2.7 meters).
   It is the second-largest freshwater lake in the continental United
   States, second only to Lake Michigan.  Lake Okeechobee's drainage basin
   covers more than 4,600 square miles (11,913 km2).  An extensive network
   of monitoring sites provide data about flood control, water supply, and
   water quality.
   By monitoring Lake Okeechobee's waters, the South Florida Water
   Management District is gaining a better understanding of this essential
   part of South Florida's heritage, and can make more accurate
   predictions and plans for the continuing protection of this great
   resource. [blt1grn.gif]
