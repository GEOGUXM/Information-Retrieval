                CAP Aerospace Education Officer's Handbook

        * Step-by-step "how to get it done" checklists for everything from
          how to develop and teach an aerospace lesson or make an AE
          presentation to the community, to developing a bulletin board or a
          complete AE resource center, and more.
        * A master schedule of AE reports
        * Help with aerospace education awards packages.
        * A listing of resources to help the AEO do the job right. A must for
          both new and experienced Aerospace Education Officers.



   [planex.gif] "Satellites In Space: Mankinds Outward Reach" Tutorial

        * In 1995, CAP petitioned the Air Command and Staff College (ACSC)
          Research Department with a proposal designed to update their
          educational materials on artificial satellites. Subsequently ACSC
          assigned the project of conducting a development study to fulfill
          the CAP proposal to a research team. The monograph, Satellites In
          Space: Mankinds Outward Reach, is the result of that study. The
          objective for the project was to educate children and adults about
          satellites orbiting the earth. Exciting and informative!
