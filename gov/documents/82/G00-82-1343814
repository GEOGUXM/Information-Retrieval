   Question: When conducting a search, I am asked to supply my state and
   zip code, but I don't know the zip code for the area. How can I get
   that information?
   Answer: Use the United States Postal Service (USPS) website to find the
   zip code. Enter the street address, city and state.

   The toll-free Eldercare Locator service operates Monday through Friday,
   9 a.m. to 8 p.m., Eastern time, and can be access by dialing
   1-800-677-1116.
