   CIP 2001


   2000 National Airspace System Capital Investment Plan Graphic Link
                                                          2002 - 2006
                     National Airspace System Capital Investment Plan

      The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Strategic Plan sets the
      following long-term mission goals for aerospace:
        * SAFETY: By 2007, reduce U.S. aviation fatal accident rates by 80
          percent from 1996 levels.
        * SECURITY: Prevent security incidents in the aviation system.
        * SYSTEM EFFICIENCY: Provide an aerospace transportation system that
          meets the needs of users and is efficient in the application of FAA
          and aerospace resources.

   This Capital Investment Plan (CIP) flows from these goals while also
   sustaining current National Airspace System (NAS) services.
