   LAWS OF THE 106TH CONGRESS AFFECTING HHS | Social Security Act Online

   The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) administers over 300
   health and social services programs established by the Congress (see
   available funding for these and other Federal programs in the Catalog
   of Federal Domestic Assistance).

   To meet the changing needs of the communities and individuals served by
   these programs, the statutes governing these programs must be modified
   from time to time. Proposals to change these laws originate from: the
   public; within the Federal, State, and local governments; and various
   private organizations. DHHS receives requests and directives for
   consideration of new legislation from the White House, OMB, and the
   Congress (House and Senate). Also, in the course of administering the
   programs, staff of the Department identify changes that would benefit
   program beneficiaries or improve the administrative efficiency of the
   programs.

   By making information regarding the legislative development process
   public, throught this Web Site, the Department of Health and Human
   Services enables private citizens to access and seek to influence the
   direction of policy discussions regarding these laws. For more
   information regarding the process, please contact the Site Webmaster
   (see below).

                                 ASPE's Role

   The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation
   (ASPE): provides guidance to the DHHS agencies regarding development of
   legislative proposals; coordinates an internal, cross-cutting,
   analytical staff review of proposals developed; clears a consensus
   package of proposals with all the operating and staff components of the
   Department; and annually submits a legislative program to OMB on behalf
   of the Secretary.

   The Office of Program Systems (OPS) in ASPE, is charged with the
   specific responsibility to organize and coordinate the Legislative Team
   review process of all legislative proposals submitted directly to the
   Assistant Secretary. Once fully reviewed by a cross-agency group of
   individuals including budget, legislative, legal counsel, policy, and
   program dimensions, proposals recommended to be advanced are privided
   to senior policy officials in the Department for approval. OPS then
   prepares materials for submission to OMB and subsequently, as
   determined, for submission to the Congress.

                          How to Prepare Proposals

   To provide a standard format for presenting legislative proposals in
   order to facilitate the review of large numbers of proposals submitted
   for consideration each year, a guide, FY 2003 Legislative Development
   Style Guide, has been developed describing how legislative proposals
   are to be prepared and submitted for consideration within the
   Department. A general discussion regarding Legislative Strategy is also
   provided, for your information. At this time, no separate process has
   been established by which the public may submit proposals for
   consideration. In general, proposals can be submitted through the
   contact provided at the bottom of this page.
