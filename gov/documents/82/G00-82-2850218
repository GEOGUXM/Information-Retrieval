          Aviation Weather Information: What Is AWIN?

   AWIN Created to Improve Safety...

   On February 12, 1997, former President Clinton called for a five-fold
   reduction in the rate of fatal accidents within a decade, and announced
   that NASA will support this national safety goal. As a result of this
   statement, NASA formed the Aeronautics Safety Investment Strategy Team
   (ASIST), and weather concerns were identified as a sub-element within
   this team. Why? Weather is a factor in approximately 30% of aviation
   accidents. In addition to safety, our primary concern, weather has
   economic consequences. Weather is responsible for approximately
   two-thirds of air carrier delays- a four billion dollar cost, of which
   1.7 billion dollars are considered avoidable.

   The goal of the AWIN program is to provide improved weather information
   (not simply data) to users in the National Airspace System, and to
   foster the improved use of this information. While the emphasis of this
   project is to provide this information to the flight deck, other
   weather information users in the National Airspace are also considered.

   Paul Stough is the Level 3 manager for AWIN.

   Who is AWIN ...

   The AWIN project is led by NASA Langley. The AWIN team includes
   researchers from NASA Langley's Crew Systems Branches (Crew Systems &
   Operations and Crew/Vehicle Integration), Sensors Branch, and
   Atmospheric Sciences Branch;  NASA Lewis' Communications Branch. We
   also work closely with related NASA efforts focusing on Icing and
   Turbulence aviation hazards, Freeflight operations, and the FAA's
   Aviation Weather Research group. The AWIN program has encouraged
   participation from industry organizations and currently fund research
   directly, and indirectly in team efforts, to over 40 organizations
   through NASA Cooperative Agreements (Principal Industry Participants).

   T he Aviation Weather Information effort is an element of NASA's
   Aviation Safety Program.
