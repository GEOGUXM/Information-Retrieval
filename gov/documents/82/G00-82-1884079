   This Index facility will provide both a `browsable' index, much like
   the traditional index included in books, as well as a searchable index.
   Both types of indices will be based on the same underlying information
   derived from

   Attributes:
          Attributes will be assigned to sectional units and equations
          characterizing them. The attributes will be derived from a
          controlled vocabulary including features such as defines Airy
          function or addition theorem. Provision for multi-level
          attributes will also be made.

   Notation:
          A table of notations will be integrated into the index.

   Glossary:
          A glossary defining terms will likely also be integrated into
          the index.

   From these data, a multilevel permuted index will be constructed which
   can be browsed or searched. In either case, once an appropriate term is
   found, links will take the user to relevant sections, equations and
   definitions.

   A hint at the kinds of attributes we have in mind can be seen on some
   of the `About' pages (extra information about sections and formulas) in
   the sample chapter.

   We also will incorporate Notations within this index, or possibly as
   separate Table of Notations reached through this page.
