Calexico's history:

Calexico began as a tent city of the Imperial Land Company and has grown into
a larger thriving city on the US-Mexico border.


Before the repeal of prohibition, Calexico was primarily a week-end town
visited by workers in the Imperial Valley in pursuit of fun and games, dance
halls and saloons, in adjacent Mexicali, which was outside the United States
and unaffected by the Volstead Act.



Although it gained a reputation for a while as a typical U.S.-Mexico border
town with all the tawdry aspects usually associated with such places, the
modern city of Calexico is a far cry from what it was back in those early
days. Hundreds of acres are now being devoted to industrial parks use and
commercial and retail incentives are being offered to encourage industrial
development.


Since Calexico represents the mixing of two cultures and areas and because of
its proximity to the Mexican border, the name Calexico was coined for a
combination of Mexico and California.

      The Gulf of California once stretched 150 miles northwest of its current
      position, covering the Imperial and Coachella Valleys. The Colorado River
      gradually built its delta across the gulf from Pilot Knob, near Yuma,
      Arizona; to the Cocopah Mountains, south of Calexico, California. The
      delta created a natural dam across the gulf, leading to the evaporation of
      water from the Salton Sink. As a result most of the Imperial and Coachella
      Valleys lie below sea level.

      The California Legislature first proposed development and irrigation of
      the Imperial Valley, using water from the Colorado River, in the 1850s.
      The proposal involved diverting the Colorado to the Alamo River drainage
      area in Mexico. Then using natural channels the water would flow through
      the Alamo river back into California, for distribution by a canal system.
      The project required a Federal grant of three million acres of government
      land. The California Legislature approved the grant, but the bill failed
      to pass the U.S. Congress in 1862. In 1876, Lieutenant Eric Bergland of
      the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers investigated the feasibility of a canal
      route traveling entirely through the United States. Bergland's report
      proved unfavorable, but he recommended the natural route through Mexico.

      After the failure of state and Federal government plans for the Imperial
      Valley, private concerns entered the competition. Oliver Wozencraft, a
      physician from New Orleans, first considered the possibility of irrigating
      the Salton Sink in the 1850s. Unable to finance his plan, Wozencraft
      abandoned the idea. John Beatty's establishment of the Colorado River
      Irrigation Company (CRIC) in 1892, plunged private business into Imperial
      Valley irrigation. The CRIC surveyed a route and planned to deliver water
      from the Colorado, in California, across the border to a short canal in
      Mexico. The canal would divert water into the Alamo River for transport
      north into the Imperial Valley. The CRIC failed to achieve its ambitious
      plan, and Beatty renamed the company the California Development Company
      (CDC) in 1896.

      The CDC built the Imperial Canal, extending diagonally from the Colorado
      River, with the head-works 500 feet north of the U.S.-Mexico border. Silt
      deposits at the head-gates halted the flow of water to the canal. The
      stoppages caused water shortages in the Imperial Valley in 1903 and 1904.
      Mexico allowed the CDC to divert water from the Colorado in Mexico. The
      company cut a heading four miles south of the border. In 1905, the river
      washed out the heading and turned inland away from its normal course to
      the Gulf of California. For two years the Colorado flowed through the
      heading, flooding and eroding farm lands in the Imperial Valley, before
      entering the Salton Sink. Early trailblazers reported infrequent salt
      pools in the sink in 1853. The Colorado River made the Salton Sea
      permanent. Before the Southern Pacific Railroad Company closed the breach,
      the surface elevation of the Salton Sea increased from 275 feet below sea
      level to 201 feet below sea level. The water rose seven inches a day in
      1906, and engulfed a salt refining works in sixty feet of water. The
      increasing size of the Salton Sea submerged an additional 298,240 acres of
      land. The Southern Pacific found itself obligated to close the breach
      because the flooding inundated the company's tracks across the Valley, and
      the California Development Company's resources proved too few to deal with
      the problem.
