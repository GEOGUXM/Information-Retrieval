Whistleblower Disclosures

General

   The OSC provides a safe channel through which current and former
   federal employees, and applicants for employment, may disclose
   information that they believe shows:
     * a violation of law, rule or regulation,
     * gross mismanagement,
     * gross waste of funds,
     * abuse of authority, or
     * a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.

   The OSC disclosure channel differs from other government whistleblower
   hotline channels in at least three ways:
     * federal law guarantees confidentiality to the whistleblower;
     * the Special Counsel may order an agency head to investigate and
       report on the disclosure; and
     * after any such investigation, the Special Counsel must send the
       agency's report, with the whistleblower's comments, to the
       President and Congress.

Procedures

   The OSC does not independently investigate allegations reported through
   its disclosure channel. The law requires the Special Counsel to send
   the information to the head of the agency concerned if the Special
   Counsel determines that there is a substantial likelihood that the
   information discloses the kind of wrongdoing described in the statute.
   The OSC will not divulge the identity of a whistleblower unless he or
   she consents.

   When the Special Counsel sends the information to the agency, the
   agency head must conduct an investigation and submit a report to the
   Special Counsel. The Special Counsel sends the agency report, along
   with any comments provided by the whistleblower, and any comments or
   recommendations by the Special Counsel, to the President and the
   congressional committees with jurisdiction over the agency.

   If the OSC does not send the whistleblower's disclosures to an agency
   head, it returns the information and any accompanying documents to the
   whistleblower. The OSC sends the whistleblower a letter explaining why
   the Special Counsel did not refer the information. This letter will let
   the whistleblower know what other disclosure channels may be available.
