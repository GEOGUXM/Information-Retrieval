   ...for the Safe Transportation of Hazardous Materials

   The purpose of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Program, first
   established by statute in 1974, is to identify and manage risks
   presented by transportation of hazardous materials in commerce. Safety
   is of paramount importance as the Department of Transportation seeks to
   involve the public, industry, and other interested parties in
   determining levels of risk that are acceptable, affordable, and
   comparable with other risks inherent in modern society.

   Today, uniform regulations to manage the risk associated with
   transportation of hazardous materials are essentially in place
   worldwide. The Department of Transportation continues to strive to
   identify and manage potential hazards, the probability of occurrence of
   incidents in transportation, and the consequences of such incidents.

   The DOT Hazardous Materials Risk Management Program encompasses
   different modes of transportation, a wide assortment of hazardous
   materials (for example, chemicals, radioactive materials, and
   infectious substances), manufacturers (hazardous materials and
   packaging products), shippers, and carriers of all sizes. Information
   on unintentional releases of hazardous materials and the consequences
   are collected and analyzed. Identifying low probability, high
   consequence events (which may not be apparent from incident data) and
   providing appropriate levels of protection are among the more demanding
   aspects of our risk management program. A further challenge is to
   strike a proper balance between levels of safety and costs that result
   from regulations, exemptions, and approvals.

   Information on aspects of the DOT Hazardous Materials Risk Management
   Program is accessible below. We plan to expand this site to include
   topics such as: Performance Measures, Data, Resources, Tools,
   Conferences, Frequently Asked Questions, References, Industry Programs,
   Case Studies, and Links. Please provide your comments, questions,
   suggested additions, or recommendations on the Feedback page.
