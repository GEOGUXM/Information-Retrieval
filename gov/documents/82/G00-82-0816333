              Defense Procurement Acquisition Exchange Program

   On October 30, Ms. Dee Lee, the Director of Defense Procurement, was
   pleased to announce the first group of Defense Procurement Acquisition
   Exchange Program (AEP) participants. This initial group included Ms.
   Tammy Bair (Army), Mr. Rex Elliott (NASA), Ms. Mariah Houton (Air
   Force), Ms. Patricia Kobus (DCMA), Ms. Terry Moore (DCMA), Ms. Karen
   Petering (Air Force), and Ms. Barbara Thompson (Navy). They will arrive
   over the next several months and will undertake challenging projects
   supporting the mission of the Office of the Director of Defense
   Procurement
   The AEP is intended to provide a unique developmental experience for
   high caliber individuals in the acquisition and acquisition-related
   career fields. The selected individuals will be afforded opportunities
   to enhance their acquisition and senior level policy skills and to
   prepare themselves for future challenging positions within the
   acquisition community. AEP announcement will be made at least once a
   year with specific projects developed by the Defense Procurement staff.
   Future opportunities will be posted on the Defense Procurement website,
   www.acq.osd.mil/dp. Additional information may be obtained on the
   program from Phil Degen, at 703-697-8334 or by e-mail at
