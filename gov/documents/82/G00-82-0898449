   Courtroom 135The first Electronic Courtroom in the Northern District of
   Ohio opened in September, 1998, in the courtroom of Judge Kathleen M.
   OMalley and was touted as the most technologically advanced courtroom
   in existence.

   This landmark project demonstrated the successful integration of
   technology and justice as the District addressed the challenge of
   ever-increasing caseloads.The pilot courtroom project in Cleveland was
   funded by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to assist the
   entire judiciary in planning for technology in new and existing
   courthouses.

   Courtroom 575The pilot project was an overwhelming success and the
   court arranged for similar installations in Akron, Toledo and
   Youngstown.
   The streamlining of the litigation process through the implementation
   of advanced communication technologies has enhanced the courts ability
   to meet the needs of the bar and the public, while preserving the
   dignity and fairness of the proceedings.

   Courtroom 215Since we are five times as likely to remember something we
   both see and hear, the audio/visual means of presentation implemented
   in the courtrooms increases both efficiency and juror comprehension.

   Courtroom 337With minimal training, attorneys can present photos,
   documents, objects, videotapes and electronic presentations to focus
   juror attention on critical details.


   DEPS Podium
   The Digital Evidence Presentation System (DEPS) serves as the heart of
   the well-concealed electronics in the courtroom. The DEPS allows
   counsel to switch from displaying exhibits, realtime transcripts, video
   recordings or multimedia presentations with the push of a button.



   Some of the advanced technology integrated into the courtroom includes:
     * A document camera which can be used to display exhibits such as
       documents or medium-sized three-dimensional objects
     * VGA connections to display multi-media presentations or images
       from a portable computer allowing documents, images, etc. to be
       displayed on any monitor in the courtroom
     * A visual image printer to produce a 3"x5" print of any image
       displayed through the DEPS
     * On-screen drawing and highlighting to emphasize specific details
       for display throughout the courtroom
     * Realtime transcription from the court reporter can be directed to
       monitors at the Judges bench and counsel tables, with prior
       arrangements with the court reporter
     * A video cassette recorder
     * 15" flat panel video displays  located on each counsel table, on
       the Judges bench, the courtroom deputy and court reporter desk, and
       between each pair of jurors to make visual display efficient
     * In addition to well-placed video displays, infrared listening
       assistance and translation is available to all participants


   Technology ready counsel tables Technology-ready counsel tables provide
   quick-connect capability for data, voice, realtime transcription and
   video. Counsel can bring portable  computer equipment to plug into
   discreetly concealed  ports to access the electronics in the courtroom.
   The courtroom is  augmented by fully integrated video and audio
   conferencing systems.
   Two video-conferencing cameras are focused on the Judge and witness, as
   well as the presenter at the lectern. A camera with pan, tilt and zoom
   capabilities and a gooseneck mounted camera at the witness box can also
   be accessed.


   DEPS touchscreen controller
   The equipment can be used for remote witness testimony, pretrial
   conferences or other court proceedings. The use of this technology is
   easily controlled from multiple touch panel controllers at the Judges
   bench and the lectern.



   The court  welcomes  the bar  to take advantage of these new
   facilities. Counsel are encouraged to contact the courtroom deputy to
   arrange for the use of this equipment. See the training schedules for
   Akron,  Cleveland and Toledo and Youngstown.
