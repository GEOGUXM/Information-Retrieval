                                INTRODUCTION

   The Customer Support Group (CSG or Helpdesk) of the Computing Services
   Department provides a single point of contact for reporting problems,
   both hardware and software, and ensures problem resolution proceeds as
   quickly as possible. All reported problems are tracked in one of two
   databases: hardware/network requests in MISJOB and software/system
   problems in the Computing Division's HelpDesk DB. If an issue can not
   be resolved by CSG, it is assigned to an appropriate expert and CSG
   tracks the problem resolution to completion.

   Customer Support is in service Monday through Friday, 8:00am - 5:00 pm.
   After hours and on weekends, the Customer Support line (630-840-2345)
   will take messages via voice mail or directs you on how to contact Data
   Center Services (Operations) for requests requiring immediate
   attention.
