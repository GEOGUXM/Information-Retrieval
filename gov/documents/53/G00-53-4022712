   Vehicle Emissions/Analysis Tools

      Assessing vehicle emissions, performance, and component packaging for
      all the new alternative fuel vehicles and advanced vehicles is a huge
      task for industry. In order to assist auto makers and their suppliers
      develop optimized vehicle systems, the Office of Transportation
      Technologies, along with their laboratory partners, have developed
      tools that can assist industry with vehicle development.

      Fuel Economy and Emissions
        * Fuel Economy Guide - Use the Fuel Economy Guide to compare the fuel
          economy of different vehicles. By paying attention to fuel economy,
          as well as to the other features you want, you can help protect the
          environment and save yourself money.
        * Air CRED online tool - This tool helps you calculate ozone emission
          reduction credits for your alternative fuel vehicles that are part
          of DOE's Clean Cities Program.
        * GREET Model - The Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy
          Use in Transportation (GREET) model calculates fuel-cycle energy
          consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases and 5 criteria
          pollutants for a given transportation fuel/technology combination.
          Researchers may input their own assumptions to generate fuel-cycle
          energy and emission results.

      Vehicle Systems Analysis
        * ADVISOR - The ADvanced VehIcle SimulatOR is ADVISOR is a vehicle
          simulation model that tests the impact of changes in vehicle
          components or other modifications that might impact fuel economy or
          emissions. The user can alter simulation results by selecting
          vehicle component types, sizes and parameters. The model is free to
          download, so develop your own simulated vehicle today!
        * PSAT - The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV)
          Systems Analysis Toolkit (PSAT) is a simulation program that helps
          narrow the technology focus of the PNGV Program to those
          configurations and components that are best suited for achieving
          the program's goals.
