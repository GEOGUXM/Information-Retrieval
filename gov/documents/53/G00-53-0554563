   The IV&V Facility strives to improve software safety, reliability, and
   quality of NASA programs and missions through effective applications of
   Systems and Software IV&V methods, practices, and techniques. The IV&V
   Facility provides tailored technical, program management, and financial
   analyses for NASA programs, industry, and other Government agencies, by
   applying software engineering "best practices" to evaluate the
   correctness and quality of critical and complex software systems
   throughout the system development life cycle.
   The IV&V Facility's analytical approaches enable efficient, cost
   effective IV&V service through the synergistic usage of broad-based,
   ecclectic expertise, adaptive software engineering "best practices",
   and tools that are in place at the IV&V Facility. The analytical
   paradigm utilized by the IV&V Facility requires a multi-disciplinary
   team, qualitative software risk and criticality assessment capability
   coupled with an extensive multi-phasic, phase-independent IV&V
   analytical process.
   Another key element of the IV&V Facility is its research partnerships.
   Research priorities are driven by technical and operational challenges
   and improvements of NASA programs. Particular emphasis is placed on
   early life cycle tools (requirements & design), software process
   modeling tools, tools to aid in the generation of integrated
   specifications sets, and tools for configuration/interface management
   and software maintenance.
   Software IV&V has been demonstrated to be an effective technique on
   large, complex software systems to increase the probability of software
   being delivered that meets requirements and is safe, within cost, and
   within schedule. When performed in parallel with the development life
   cycle, software IV&V provides for the early detection and
   identification of risk elements. The program is then able to take
   action to mitigate these risks early in the life cycle.
