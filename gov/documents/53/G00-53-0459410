                       LBNL Visualization Group Projects

   Below are some of the projects that we have been working on. Nearly all
   of them are collaborations of one type or another.

  Ongoing Work

   Summer 2001 Projects by UCD and SFU Students

   Visapult: Image Based Rendering Assisted Volume Rendering,
          Image-based rendering principles are used as the basis for a
          scalable, parallel volume rendering engine. This project is
          funded by NGI under the Combustion Corridor proposal.

  Past Work

   3D Microtubule Reconstruction.
          Collaboration with Ken Downing, LSD/LBL/UCB, to visualize high
          resolution models of a 3D microtubule reconstruction (October
          2001).

   Toroidal Coiling of DNA.
          Collaboration with Ken Downing, LSD/LBL/UCB, to visualize
          observed and theoretical model of the toroidal coiling of DNA
          (October 2001).

   ChomboVis,
          A adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) visualizational tool developed
          with the Applied Numerical Algorithms Group at LBNL/NERSC.

   Visualizing the Interactions of Two Fluids,
          The goal was to develop a tool to view two interacting fluid
          species at one time for a NERSC user at the College of William &
          Mary. The final product was to create movies so that the time
          dependent nature could be studied. The final tool was written in
          IDL and the tool and documentation was released to the user.
          Some examples movies are:

                Plot of one fluid (energy.1): plot_surf,'energy.1'
                Plot of one energy.1 & energy.2 and scaling the mins and
                maxs.
                plot_surf,'energy.1','energy.2',/noscale,nsteps=600,file1=
                [.2,.7]

   Cosmology,
          Work with Julian Borrill and Rob Thacker visualizing
          cosmological computations.

   1999 Combustion Vis LDRD
          The goal of this project is to evaulate and demonstrate some
          techniques for visualization specifically for combustion data
          with embedded boundary conditions.

   The Virtual Protractor, Summer-Fall 1999
          A virtual protractor is used to measure angles between objects
          perceived in stereo image pairs using virtual reality
          technology. Each image is generated from a scanning electron
          microscope, and stereo pairs are obtained by either manipulating
          the specimen or the electron beam. Images from slightly
          different viewpoints are combined using stereoscopic rendering
          to create the illusion of a 3D scene. Virtual reality user
          interface technology is used to manipulate a virtual measuring
          device with the goal of accurately measuring spatial
          characteristics of 3D objects perceived while viewing the stereo
          image pairs. This approach relies on the human observers'
          ability to successfully fuse stereo geometry and image-based
          data. A paper was presented at IEEE Vis99 that describes our
          work.

   Molecular Dynamics - Cesium, Summer-Fall 1999
          An understanding of Cs-smectite systems is necessary to predict
          the permeability of clay liners at nuclear waste containment
          facilities to 137-Cs radioactive waste.

   DataBlaster Toolkit , 1998
          The intent of this toolset is to provide the means to easily
          move data from simulations to visualization tools. Unlike some
          other code instrumentation tools (such as CUMULVS), there are
          absolutely no dependancies or restrictions with respect to MP
          computing environments. The underlying presumption in this
          toolkit is that the overall goal is to send data, which can be
          up to a five-dimensional array of double precision floating
          point values, from a computational source to a consumer. The
          underlying data must be reducable to a contiguous chunk of
          memory. This tool makes use of the "eXternal Data
          Representation" (XDR) libraries for transmission and translation
          from one architecture to another. Therefore, you can send
          compute data on an 8-byte-word big-endian machine and consume
          the data on a 4-byte-word little endian workstation. XDR takes
          care of all the architecture representation issues (thus, XDR
          must be present on both client and server machines).

   Computational Chemistry Grand Challenge, Summer 1998
          This work was done with researchers at Northwestern University
          who are studying the enzyme beta-lactamase.

   Dehydrogenation Catalysis, Summer 1998
          Visualizations of a theorectical chemical reaction - the
          dehydrogenation of ethylene.

   Reservoir Simulation
          Reservoir characterization involves predicting production.
          Production is a function of geophysical and geochemical
          parameters. Typically, these parameters are estimated from
          samples. The challenge is better predictions of these unknowns,
          as well as better tools for calculating production given a set
          of parameters. Two separate projects were demonstrated at
          Supercomputing 1997 in San Jose, CA.

   Yucca Mountain Project, Spring 1997
          The VisGroup is working with scientists in ESD to create a
          visualization showing the Yucca Mountain storage facility. This
          visualization integrates divergent types of data, and will be
          used to ask "what if" questions pertaining to water flow through
          the site. Look for this model soon in in LBL's Washington DC
          office.

   Mining for Copper, Spring-Summer 1997
          This interesting collaboration has resulted in new tools for
          interacting with and visualizing large datasets.

   Material Science NMR Project
          Material Science research relies heavily on the use of Nuclear
          Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to study materials. Researchers at LBNL
          and UC Berkeley are working with the Visualization Group to
          explore the results of computer simulations of NMR physics run
          on the NERSC T3E.

   Radiation Biology and DNA Repair
          Radiation damage to DNA and the repair thereof is being
          investigated at LBNL by the Department of Radiation Biology and
          DNA Repair in the Life Sciences Division. Data sets contain tens
          of thousands atoms are generated. Hierarchical methods of
          visualization are being investigated on these data sets.

   ACTI Project
          A collaboration with the oil industry produced new commercially
          available products using visualization tools developed by the
          Visualization Group at Berkeley Lab.

   Computational Accelerator Physics Grand Challenge
          Visualization will play a key role in this Grand Challenge
          project, which is attempting to overcome many of the problems
          with simulating particle accelerator beam physics.

   UTCHEM Project
          A prototype interface - our foray into the world of VR and
          scientific computing. Fall, 1993.

   VRModules, version 2.0
          How can one bring Virtual Reality to the desktop? Our VRModules
          Library is a collection of AVS Modules that implement VR. This
          link describes the contents of the VRModules library.
