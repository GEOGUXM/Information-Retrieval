                              General Information

   The CIT Computer Training Program provided by the Center for
   Information Technology offers a wide variety of courses that enable
   users to make efficient and effective use of computing, networking, and
   information systems in their work at NIH. The training program is open
   to NIH employees and to all users of CIT computing facilities.
   Additional computer courses are available through the NIH Human
   Resource Development Division and from the NIH Library; for further
   information check the links available under “Other Computer Training”.

   The program includes classroom courses, seminars, and self-study
   courses. Interactive class attendance via PictureTel can be arranged
   for students in off site locations. Description of each course as well
   as the information on the intended audience can be found on the main
   training page under “Categories”. “Independent Study Courses” contains
   a description of the self-study program and of each course available.

   There is no charge for attending courses and seminars in the CIT
   Program.

   Students are encouraged to call the Training Program with questions
   about choosing classes, background preparation needed for a particular
   course, and any other aspect of the Training Program.

   Catalog information is available online through the World Wide Web at
   http://training.cit.nih.gov/.

   Selecting Courses

   Students should make certain that they meet the guidelines given for
   who should attend. Many courses are open only to NIH staff; others
   require students to be registered CIT users.

   Registered users who are not a part of NIH may take courses specific to
   their use of NIH computing services.

   With approval from their NIH project director, contractors can take
   courses that are closely related to their current assignments when
   doing so is in the best interest of NIH.

   From 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., staff can help you select courses or give
   further information on course content. For information on becoming a
   CIT registered user, contact the Technical Assistance and Support
   Center, Building 12A, Room 1011, MSC 5605, telephone 301-594-6248 or
   GOCIT within NIH.

   The courses provide short, intensive exposures to each topic and are
   most beneficial when followed by on-the-job experience.

   Registration

   Most students apply via the Web at http://training.cit.nih.gov/.
   Students can also register by calling the Training Program at GOCIT
   (301-594-6248).

   Supervisor approval should be obtained before registering.

   Applications may be submitted any time after the courses are announced.
   Students will be accepted as long as there is space in the class. The
   first class in the Spring 2002 term begins January 22.

   Any applicant who cannot be accepted because a course is filled or who
   applies for a course after it has taken place will be placed on a
   waiting list.

   Applicants who apply via the Web will be sent an email confirmation.
   Those who register by phone can usually be given their status during
   the initial call. Also, within two days, the status of the application
   will be posted on the Web at http://training.cit.nih.gov/Lookup.asp

   Attendance

   Because space is limited, students who cannot attend a class for which
   they have been enrolled must notify the Training Program at GOCIT
   (301-594-6248), so another student can take their place.

   Students who are on a wait list may attempt to get into the class as a
   standby. Seats left empty 10 minutes into a class will be considered
   available.

   Students who attend class and successfully complete any required
   assignments will receive completion certificates.

   Please note that Building 12A is a secure building. Students should
   bring their government identifications to check in with the guard.

   Join Our Faculty

   The NIH Computer Training Program welcomes volunteer instructors from
   CIT and throughout NIH. Without the volunteers, who comprise 75% of our
   faculty, it would not be possible to offer this large and varied
   program to NIH and its computing community.

   If you have expertise you would be willing to consider sharing, please
   let us know. We have extensive instructor support services (e.g.
   obtaining publications for instructors, polishing course descriptions,
   duplicating notes, setting up projection systems, providing hands-on
   practice facilities, etc.) to make efficient use of your time and make
   your presentation effective. Let us know how we can help.

   Accommodations for Disabilities

   There is an elevator in Building 12A, and both the classrooms and
   restrooms on the same floor are wheelchair accessible. Because
   elevators cannot be used in case of fire, mobility handicapped students
   who may need assistance negotiating the stairs should inform the
   Training Program before the first day of class.

   If any special services (such as recorded notes) will be needed, the
   individual should contact the Training Program at least 2 weeks in
   advance to make the necessary arrangements.

   To provide better service to hearing or speech impaired users, the
   Training Program has a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD).
   The number is 301-496-8294.

   Parking

   All NIH employees, including those from off-campus locations, must have
   a NIH parking permit and must park in the employee lots. (Contact the
   Parking Office, Building 31, Room B1C19, Telephone 301-496-6851 for
   further information.) There is a charge for visitor parking. Metered
   visitor parking (quarters only) for up to 3 hours is available for
   $2.00 per hour. All day visitor parking in controlled lots costs
   $12.00.

   Because PARKING IS EXTREMELY LIMITED the use of carpools and public
   transportation are encouraged. There is a Metro Red Line stop on the
   NIH grounds located conveniently close to Building 12A.

   NIH Learning Technology Committee

   IC Representatives meet quarterly to discuss distance learning.
   Visitors are welcome.  For further information, click here.
