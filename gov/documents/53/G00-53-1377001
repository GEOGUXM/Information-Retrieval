   A computer program entitled “Crop Sequence Calculator” is designed to
   help producers assess crop production and the potential returns of ten
   crops in a diverse cropping system.  Expected crop prices and expected
   loan deficiency payments (LDP) can be input to provide rapid
   calculations of potential returns.  The program contains information on
   crop production, plant diseases, weeds, crop water use, and surface
   soil properties to aid producers in their evaluation of management
   risks associated with different crop sequences.  The user-friendly
   program runs directly from a CD-ROM eliminating the need for additional
   disk space or installation procedures.  The program is designed for
   computers running Windows^® (3.1/95/98/ME/NT/2000) and works best with
   a screen area of 800 X 600 pixels or greater.
