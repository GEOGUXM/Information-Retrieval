                            Loki - What's Inside
     __________________________________________________________________

Hardware

   Each node consists of:
     * (1) Intel Pentium Pro 200 Mhz CPU with 256k integrated L2 cache
     * (1) Intel VS440FX (Venus) motherboard utilizing the 82440FX
       (Natoma) chipset.
     * (4) 8x36 60ns parity SIMMS (128 Mb per node)
     * (1) Quantum Fireball 3240 Mbyte IDE Hard Drive
     * (1) Cogent EM400 TX PCI Quartet Fast Ethernet Adapter
     * (1) SMC EtherPower 10/100 Fast Ethernet PCI Network Card
     * (1) S3 Trio-64 1Mb PCI Video Card

   Each node is directly connected to four others using crossed Category-5
   stranded cable to form a hypercube network. The hypercube is augmented
   with two 3Com SuperStack II Switch 3000 TX 8-port Fast Ethernet
   switches, which also provide connectivity to the front-end.
   Uniterruptible power is provided by an APC Smart-UPS 2200.

   For Supercomputing '96, each node has an added D-Link DFE-500TX 100 Mb
   Fast Ethernet Adapter, which provides connectivity to the Caltech
   machine.

Software

   Linux Penguin Logo

   Each node is running Linux. We use the standard Linux software tools
   and the GNU programming tools. The kernel has not been modified from
   its form in the Linux distribution.
