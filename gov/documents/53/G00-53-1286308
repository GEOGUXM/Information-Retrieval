   Getting Started with Public Awareness
   Campaigns




        As a National Diabetes Education Program partner, you play an essential
        role in educating people with diabetes and their families about how to
        control their disease. You can help us spread the message about healthy
        living with diabetes by distributing campaign materials to your
        members, constituents, patients, health professionals, local media, and
        other community organizations. With your help, we can improve
        understanding about diabetes control. Together, we can make a
        difference for the 16 million Americans with diabetes and their
        families.

     Ideas for Getting Started

          * Spread the word about diabetes control.
            Distribute NDEP materials to your members and local media contacts.
            Use our resources at meetings, health fairs, work sites, and other
            community programs. Create a diabetes section in your newsletter or
            on your web site.
          * Promote the NDEP's resources.
            Let your members know they can call the National Diabetes
            Information Clearinghouse at 1-800-438-5383 to order NDEP and other
            diabetes education materials. Single copies of print materials are
            provided free of charge. All materials are copyright-free.
            Reproducible artwork and printer-ready disks are available; you may
            add your organization's logo to any of our materials.
          * Link your web site to ours.
            Create a link to our site and let your members know they can
            preview and print our materials and find out about current program
            activities.
          * Use the NDEP materials that work for your audience.
            NDEP materials are primarily for people with type 2 (adult onset)
            diabetes. Tailored materials are available for the general
            audience, older Americans, African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos,
            American Indians, and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (in
            English and 11 different languages).
          * Work with your State Diabetes Control Program.
            Every State and territory has a Diabetes Control Program that is an
            NDEP partner. Join your State's efforts to expand the reach of NDEP
            messages and activities. To identify your State program contact, go
            to www.cdc.gov/diabetes and click on "State-based Programs."
          * Tap into NDEP's resources to plan diabetes activities.
            Put diabetes on your organization's agenda with ideas from NDEP's
            Community Partnership Guide. Use the materials designed for
            business and managed care, including Making a Difference: The
            Business Community Takes on Diabetes, to promote diabetes control
            in the workplace. See our Partner Spotlight for more ideas. Order
            free single copies of NDEP publications.
          * Develop your own ideas for diabetes education activities.
            There are no limits to what you can do. You know your organization,
            its capabilities, and its needs. Do whatever works best for you.
