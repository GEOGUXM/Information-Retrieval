           The United States Botanic Garden Conservatory is Now Open

   [USBG logo]

Welcome

   The Architect of the Capitol and the U.S. Botanic Garden welcome you to
   the newly renovated Conservatory. We are proud to offer the citizens of
   Washington and visitors from across the nation a beautiful and
   fascinating living plant museum here on our Nation's Mall at the foot
   of the U.S. Capitol. We invite you to return again and again, to watch
   us grow and to see our ever-changing exhibits.

What's New?

   Visitors can see for themselves the all new plant exhibits that include
   nearly 4,000 living specimens.

   Behind the scenes is a state-of-the-art completely automated
   environmental control system. Computers can monitor the outside weather
   and automatically control misting, shade cloth, fans, air-handling
   equipment, heat, and window vents to achieve a perfect range of day and
   night temperature and humidity.

   For the comfort of visitors, the Galleries, Garden Store, and Vestibule
   are now air conditioned and the building now meets all safety and
   accessibility standards. A new south addition provides service
   facilities, restrooms, and emergency exit.

What's Restored?

   The superstructure, limestone facade, fountains, radiator, glazing
   system, and all exterior windows and doors have been restored or
   refabricated according to the original design of the building. The Palm
   House structure, now called the Jungle, has been recreated to the
   original design, but also now includes a visitor walkway at 24 feet
   above the floor accessible by both stairs and elevator.
