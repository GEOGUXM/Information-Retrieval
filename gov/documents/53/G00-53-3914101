                  SETTLEMENT PROGRAM -- APPEAL CONFERENCES

   The primary purpose of a prehearing conference shall be to explore
   settlement of the dispute that gave rise to the appeal. The judge or
   court mediator may require the attendance of parties and counsel.
   Information disclosed to the judge or court mediator in settlement
   discussions shall be kept confidential and shall not be disclosed to
   the judges deciding the appeal or to any other person outside the
   settlement program participants. (rev. 7/94) In the context of a
   settlement or mediation in a civil appeal, the parties who have
   otherwise settled the case may stipulate to have one or more issues in
   the appeal submitted to an appellate commissioner for a binding
   determination. (New 7/2001)

   (c) Binding Determinations by Appellate Commissioner. In the context of
   a settlement or mediation in a civil appeal, the parties may stipulate
   to having one or more issues in their appeal referred for a binding
   determination by an Appellate Commissioner. Where the parties enter
   into such a stipulation, the matter may be handled with abbreviated and
   accelerated briefing and a guaranteed opportunity for in-person or
   telephonic oral argument before the Appellate Commissioner. The
   Appellate Commissioner will issue a determination and, if requested, a
   written statement of reasons. The determination will have no
   precedential effect and will be final and nonreviewable. Cases will
   ordinarily be referred to the Appellate Commissioner through the
   court's mediation program. In some instances, the court's pro se unit
   may also alert parties to the availability of this program. For further
   information, please contact the Circuit Mediation Office at (415)
