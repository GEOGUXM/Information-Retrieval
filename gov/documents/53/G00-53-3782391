                         Characteristics of Transits

                                 [Logo.gif]



     Three parameters describe the characteristics of a planetary
     transit:
     * the period of recurrence of the transit;
     * the duration of the transit.and
     * the fractional change in brightness of the star.

The Planet's Orbital Period

     The period, P, is used to determine the semi-major axis, a, given
     that the stellar mass, M*, is known from the spectral type of the
     star. Kepler's Third Law is used to calculate the semi-major axis:

                               [equation0.gif]

The Transit Duration

     For transits across the center of the star the transit duration is
     given by:

                              [equation1.gif] ,

     where d* is the stellar diameter in solar diameters, M* is the
     stellar mass in solar masses and a is the orbital semi-major axis in
     AU. The duration does not tell us anything physically about the
     planet. However, like the transit depth, the duration must by
     consistent for all the transits of a given planet-star combination.
     If not, then one suspects that there are multiple planets in the
     system that are being detected or some other non-transit phenomena
     is taking place.

The Transit Depth, i.e., the Planet's Size

     The fractional change in brightness or transit depth is equal to the
     ratio of the area of the planet to the area of the star. This
     measurement is used to calculate the size of the planet given that
     the size of the star is known from its spectral type.

     The table below lists the duration and transit depth (equal to the
     ratio of the planet area to the area of the Sun) for several cases.
     Single transits of giant planets have depths on the order of 1%.
     These transits are so large that follow-up verification can be done
     from the ground.

Signal-to-Noise Dependence

     Our instrument is designed to produce an SNR=8 sigma for an
     Earth-size planet orbiting an m[v]=12 solar-like star with 4
     near-grazing transits having a duration of 6.5 hrs. The
     signal-to-noise (SNR) varies as (nt)^1/2, where t is the transit
     duration and n is the number of transits which equals the mission
     life divided by the orbital period. Thus, for a given star and using
     Kepler's third law, the SNR relative to that at 1 AU, SNR[1AU],
     increases with decreasing a as a^-1/2:

                               [equation4.gif]

Geometric Probability

     Transits can only be detected if the planetary orbit is near the
     line-of-sight (LOS) between the observer and the star. This requires
     that the planet's orbital pole be within an angle of d*/a (part 1 of
     the figure below) measured from the center of the star and
     perpendicular to the LOS, where d* is the stellar diameter (= 0.0093
     AU for the Sun) and a is the planet's orbital radius.

     This is possible for all 2pi angles about the LOS, i.e., for a total
     of 4pi d*/2a steradians of pole positions on the celestial sphere
     (part 2 of figure).

     Thus the geometric probability for seeing a transit for any random
     planetary orbit is simply d*/2a (part 3 of figure) (Borucki and
     Summers, 1984, Koch and Borucki, 1996).

                             [Transit_prob.gif]

     For the Earth and Venus this is 0.47% and 0.65% respectively (see
     above Table). Because grazing transits are not easily detected,
     those with a duration less than half of a central transit are
     ignored. Since a chord equal to half the diameter is at a distance
     of 0.866 of the radius from the center of a circle, the usable
     transits account for 86.6% of the total. If other planetary systems
     are similar to our solar system in that they also contain two
     Earth-size planets in inner orbits, and since the orbits are not
     co-planar to within 2d*/D, the probabilities can be added. Thus,
     approximately 0.011 x 0.866 = 1% of the solar-like stars with
     planets should show Earth-size transits.

Probability for Detection of Multiple Planets Per System

     Current models for planetary system formation assume that the
     planets are formed out of a common nebula with the star and that the
     orbital planes should have small relative inclinations. For the
     solar system, these inclinations are on the order of a few degrees
     (see table above). Similarly, the inclinations are also small for
     the inner moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune. If one were to view
     the system near either node of the intersection of the orbital
     planes of two planets, then both planets would be observed. For
     small relative inclinations of the planes, (phi1 + phi2) < d*/a,
     both planets would always be observed, and for (phi1 + phi2)/ >=
     d*/a the probability for seeing a second planet in the system is
     given by (Koch and Borucki, 1996):

                               [equation2.gif]

     For the Venus-Earth combination, there is a 12% chance of seeing
     both planets. Thus, there appears to be a significant chance that
     multiple-planetary systems can be seen. This result should lead to a
     further refinement of the models that describe both the frequency of
     planet formation as well as the co-planarity of their orbits.
