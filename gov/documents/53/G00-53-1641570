    The Public Schools Accountability Act (PSAA), signed into law in 1999
        (SB 1X, Chapter 3 of 1999), authorizes the creation of a new
    educational accountability system for California public schools. Its
   primary goal is to help schools improve the academic achievement of all
                                  students.
