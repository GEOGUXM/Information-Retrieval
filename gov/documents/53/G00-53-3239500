   Welcome!

     The American Indian Program (AIP) Home Page has been designed to
     bring you the latest information and news about our program, as well
     as providing job listings. This home page has also been designed to
     provide links to all other Special Emphasis Programs (SEPs) and the
     Office of Equal Opportunity at DOE/AL.

       Please help the AIP with your ideas for the April 2001 American
     Indian Month or if you have any comments, questions, and/or problems
                         please contact us directly.
