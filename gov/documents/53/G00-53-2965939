                                GOES-M Update
   On August 12, 2001, GOES-M successfully achieved a series of milestones
     with the AAM part 2, final deployment of the magnetometer boom and
                        solar array, and SXI turn on.
    AAM part 2 was executed at 9:47am EDT. This maneuver was performed at
    perigee 28. The burn lasted exactly 45.5 seconds. The Main Spacecraft
    Thruster (MST) flange temperature reached 104 degrees C. The JPL/DSN
     Goldstone 34 meter antenna (D27) was used as the primary commanding
     site for this maneuver. This maneuver reduced the apogee by 950 km.
     Current station location is 91 degrees West longitude and drifting
   approximately .4 degrees per day. The orbital period is a near nominal
       24 hours. All telemetry parameters remained well within limits
                          throughout this maneuver.
   SXI was successfully commanded on at 11:51am EDT following solar array
       phase 2 deployment. The SXI was powered on to maintain thermal
     constraints on the instrument. In addition, the SXI UV lamp will be
      cycled on every hour (for a 5 minute duration) then turned-off to
     ensure the UV lamp stays within thermal limits. Spacecraft bus and
   payload heaters were then configured for transfer orbit. Power amps A &
              C were also turned on to provide heating as well.
   After returning to Normal Sun Acq mode the SA was briefly placed in run
      mode to verify solar array drive motor (10 minutes forward and 10
    minutes reverse motion) for a total of 2.5 degrees each direction. In
   addition, the solar array was slewed 30 degrees in a reverse direction
   and slewed back to the original 270 degree position. The slew test was
    performed in preparation for tonights Off-axis Sun Acq. mode entrance
    which will require a 30 degree solar array slew to sun-line normal to
      prevent excessive SAS cooling. Magnetometer #2 was powered on and
       calibrated to verify proper operation then reconfigured back to
                              Magnetometer #1.
    Again, the MST will not be permanently isolated until Tuesday evening
     following the Solar Sail deployment. The orbit will be circularized
     into the final orbit over the next week through a series of 3 trim
                maneuvers using the 5 lb attitude thrusters.
           All other telemetry parameters remained within limits.
                        Spacecraft Orbit Parameters:
                         Inclination = .314 degrees
                              Apogee = 42248 km
                             Perigee = 42026 km
                        Orbital Period = 23.91 hours
                      Drift Rate = .4 degrees/day East
                        Station Location = 92 degrees
