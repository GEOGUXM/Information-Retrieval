    Frequency Conversion Theory in Support of the National Ignition Facility
     __________________________________________________________________

   Various target simulations and experiments indicate that the most
   desirable laser wavelengths for inertial confinement fusion lie near
   0.3 mm, whereas the high-energy glass laser systems designed for the
   National Ignition Facility (NIF) emit near 1.05 mm. A crucial part of
   NIF therefore centers around the frequency tripling of the 1.05 mm
   radiation. The NIF baseline design involves two KDP (potassium
   dihydrogen phosphate) crystals for this purpose. Laser radiation
   incident on the first crystal is doubled in frequency via the nonlinear
   susceptibility of KDP, and in the second crystal the residual
   fundamental mixes with the second harmonic via this same nonlinearity
   to generate the desired third harmonic (Figure 1).

   "e" denote polarization directions for ordinary and extraordinary
   waves.

   This design was based on simplified theoretical analyses performed at
   several laboratories, and on experimental confirmations that
   third-harmonic conversion efficiencies on the order of 70% could in
   fact be realized. However, the analyses were based on highly simplied
   assumptions such as perfect plane-wave and monochromatic fields, and
   the experiments were somewhat artificial in that they were designed to
   meet these idealized conditions as closely as possible. NIF fields will
   have both phase and intensity variations in space and in time, and our
   work over the past three years has focused on more realistic
   simulations of experiments at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
   (LLNL), as well as the design of more efficient frequency conversion
   schemes under conditions of practical interest for NIF.

   We have developed the theory and computer codes accomodating arbitrary
   spatial and temporal variations of the fundamental and harmonic fields.
   Comparison of the code predictions with measured LLNL harmonic
   conversion efficiencies showed excellent agreement except at the
   highest field intensities, where the predictions for frequency tripling
   efficiencies were typically 10-20% higher than was measured. However,
   we found that the addition of small phase ripples across the incident
   fundamental wavefront had the effect of lowering the high-intensity
   conversion efficiencies while leaving the lower-intensity predictions
   essentially unaltered (Figure 2). Interferometric analyses of the KDP
   crystals showed that machining and polishing "grooves" on the crystal
   surfaces were of approximately the amplitude and period required to
   translate effectively into the sort of phase ripples we had postulated.
   Subsequent experiments at LLNL introduced deliberate phase ripples on
   the incident wavefront and corroborated the essential predictions of
   our code and also an approximate perturbation-theoretic analysis of
   phase ripples.

   Figure 2: Comparison of theory to experimental data points (D). The
   dashed curve is the theoretical prediction for the third-harmonic
   conversion efficiency versus input intensity to the doubling crystal,
   assuming a uniform phase profile, whereas the solid curve includes
   small phase ripples on the input field.

   We have suggested three- and four-crystal designs in order to
   efficiently triple fields with the temporal intensity profile believed
   to be most propitious for NIF, as well as fields with large bandwidth
   produced by phase modulation. The latter is particularly relevant for
   direct-drive ICF. Three-crystal experiments at LLNL have produced
   conversion efficiencies in agreement with theoretical expectations, and
   large-bandwidth experiments are expected to be undertaken in the near
   future.
