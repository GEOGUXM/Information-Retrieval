      Ask Congressman Brad Carson a Question
            I believe that this Online Town Hall Meeting realizes the unique
      potential of the internet to increase the involvement of citizens in
      the political process. As your Congressman, I hope that you will make
      use of this Town Hall as a means to communicate with me about the
      concerns facing our country and important to you. I will answer as many
      questions as I can, and post the question and my response on my
      internet site to be read by all of the citizens of the Second District.
