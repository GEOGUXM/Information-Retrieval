                         Technology Data and Modeling

    Energy data are abundant, but the right data for making policy
    decisions are not always available in usable form. The projects
    described here compile technology data for all major end-uses in
    residential and commercial buildings, incorporate them into computer
    models, and summarize them in widely-used reference reports. The
    reports include (where available) data on equipment shipments,
    shipment-weighted efficiencies, hours of use, annual energy use,
    insulation levels, window characteristics, prices for efficient
    products, minimum efficiency standards, and technology performance.

     1. Residential Miscellaneous Electricity

     5. Lighting Market Sourcebook for the U.S. (Res. / Comm.)
     6. Use of the National Energy Modeling System at LBNL
     7. Geographic Information Systems
     8. Information Technology and Resource Use
     9. Treatment of Wind Energy in NEMS
    10. Analysis of California Electricity Consumption
