       " " What are commodity classifications and when do I need one?

            " " Guidance on requesting a Commodity Classification
      " " In some cases a license may be needed from the Department of
       State.  How do you determine which Federal agency has commodity
               jurisdiction over the items you want to export?

   " " How you can order our forms "on-line" and have them sent to you by
                              mail or courier?
   " " Rather than dealing with a lot of paper forms it may be easier and
    faster to submit applications electronically. Our Simplified Network
