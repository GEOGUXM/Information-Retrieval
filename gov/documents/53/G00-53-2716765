   The TERRA spacecraft (formally known as EOS-AM) was successfully
   launched on Saturday, December 18, 1999 at 18:57 GMT, on an Atlas-IIAS
   Expendable Launch Vehicle from Space Launch Complex-3 East at the
   Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) in Lompoc, California. The TERRA
   launch was the first liquid hydrogen fuel expendable launch vehicle
   flown from VAFB. The SLC-3E launch pad was completely upgraded prior to
   the launch.

                            The SLC-3E Launch Pad

   The ATLAS IIAS consists of the LOX/RP-1 fueled Atlas Booster with four
   Thiokol Castor IVA solid rocket boosters, and the liquid
   oxygen/hydrogen fueled Centaur Upper Stage. Avionics for the control of
   the IIAS's flight were housed in the Centaur equipment module on top of
   the Centaur Stage. The TERRA spacecraft was housed in a three foot
   stretched 14 foot diameter Fairing. The enhancements made to the Atlas
   IIAS configuration for the TERRA Mission include a new payload adapter,
   a new spacecraft separation system, a longer payload fairing, and
   strengthened vehicle mechanical components.

   Atlas IIAS Launch Services for the TERRA Program were managed by the
   Lewis Research Center through a contract with Lockheed Martin
   Astronautics, Denver, Colorado. The major components of the Atlas IIAS
   vehicle were manufactured in California, Texas, and Utah. Assembly and
   integration was accomplished in Denver, Colorado before the ELV was
   shipped to VAFB. The solid rocket boosters were shipped directly to
   VAFB. Once the spacecraft and the ELV arrived at VAFB, the TERRA
   satellite was placed within Fairing section. The encapsulated section
   was then transported to the SLC-3E launch pad and hoisted onto the ELV
   in preparation for launch.
