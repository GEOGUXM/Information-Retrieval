  2002 Snowmass Fusion Summer Study Background and Organization

     * Announcement of 2002 Fusion Summer Study The 2002 Fusion Summer
       Study will be a forum for the critical assessment of major
       next-steps in the fusion energy sciences program, and will provide
       crucial community input to the long range planning activities
       undertaken by the DOE and the FESAC. It will be an ideal place for
       a broad community of scientists to examine goals and proposed
       initiatives in burning plasma science in magnetic fusion energy and
       integrated research experiments in inertial fusion energy. This
       meeting is open to every member of the fusion energy science
       community and significant international participation is
       encouraged. Snowmass 2002 Fusion Summer Study
     * An organization meeting was held at Livermore November 27 - 28 with
       the Snowmass working group leaders and convenors.
     * An information town meeting on the FESAC Burning Plasma Report,
       Plans for Snowmass 2002, and the NSO Comparative Assessment was
       held on on Tuesday, Oct. 30, from 5:15 PM to 6:30 PM in the Hyatt

  FIRE and the Multi-Machine Strategy

   The Secretary of Energy Advisory Board(SEAB) Task Force on Fusion
   Energy review of the U. S. fusion program noted that "A necessary next
   major scientific step is the exploration of the physics of a burning
   plasma. At the present time only the tokamak is sufficiently advanced
   as to assure the necessary confinement in such an experiment." The
   National Research Council Assessment of Fusion Science(FuSAC) Interim
   Report identified several critical unresolved fusion science issues:
   (1) turbulence and transport, (2) energy density limits and (3)
   integrated physics of self-heated plasmas. The goal of FIRE is to
   address the critical scientific issues of a magnetically confined
   fusion plasma identified by SEAB and FuSAC within the next decade using
   the most cost-effective approach. Success in FIRE would serve as a
   "Stepping Stone" to provide the scientific foundation needed for an
   attractive fusion energy source as envisioned by the Advanced Reactor
   Innovation Evaluation Study (ARIES) .
