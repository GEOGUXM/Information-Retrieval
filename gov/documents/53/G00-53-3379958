   Currently, a long-term study of screwworm population dynamics and
   ecology is being conducted in the Soberania National Park in the area
   of the Panama Canal.  This mark-release-recapture study was initiated
   on 23 September 1996 and serves a number of purposes.  First, this
   study provides baseline data for native screwworm populations over
   three rainy seasons, two dry seasons and the transitional periods in
   between.  Data such as these have never been available before and will
   provide increased understanding of screwworm population dynamics,
   behavior, and ecology.  Secondly, data from this study are being
   correlated with vegetation classifications from satellite imagery and
   geographic information systems to produce maps identifying favorable
   screwworm habitats.  Additionally, data from this study are also
   important in the correlation and verification of the computer model of
   screwworm population dynamics (SWFSIM).

   Trapping of screwworm flies is also being conducted in the area of the
   Panama Canal using Vertical Sticky Traps baited with the attractant,
   Swormlure-4.  These data will also be useful in the documentation of
   screwworm eradication and to the computer modeling and remote sensing
   research efforts.

   A study of the negative impact of screwworm on populations of howler
   monkeys is also ongoing.  This study is being conducted in cooperation
   with a scientist of the University of California, Berkeley.
