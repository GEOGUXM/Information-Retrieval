   Mortality and Health Information

   The National Wildlife Health Center provides technical assistance and
   leadership for addressing health issues involving wildlife resources
   under Department of Interior steward ship and fosters partner ships
   with others to address wildlife health as a component of ecosystem
   health.

   During the past quarter-century the emergence of new diseases
   afflicting humans and the re-emergence of previously conquered diseases
   have become an international focus for concern and action. Wildlife
   populations are also afflicted by new and re-emerging diseases and the
   National Wildlife Health Center, a component of the U.S. Geological
   Survey located in Madison, Wisconsin, was established to address the
   health and disease issues of free-ranging wildlife.

   Specialized biological containment facilities USGS to investigate
   highly infectious diseases affecting a broad spectrum of wildlife such
   as amphibians, eagles, sea turtles, sea otters, migratory birds,
   wolves, large mammals, and other species.

   team of more than 70 scientists and support personnel who are
   specialists in such fields as wildlife ecology, epidemiology,
   veterinary medicine, pathology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology,
   chemistry, biometry, population ecology. The Center provides a
   multi-disciplinary, integrated program of disease diagnosis, field
   response, research, and training.

   The Center international focal point for research, information, and
   scholarly exchange on scientific matters involving the study of
   wildlife health and disease.USGS is also working to better understand
   the ecological relationships between free-ranging wildlife, domestic
   animals, and public health concerns involving zoonotic diseases.

   The gregarious habits of many wildlife species can enhance their
   susceptibility to catastrophic losses from diseases such as avian
   botulism and pesticide poisoning, and infectious diseases that can
   rapidly spread through a population. The mobility of wildlife enhances
   the potential for infectious disease to quickly spread to new locations
   and populations, Timely and accurate diagnosis of wildlife illness and
   mortality is critical to achieving effective disease control and
   prevention.

   Center research focuses on understanding the ecology of disease in
   order to identify the most vulnerable linkages between affected species
   (the host), the disease agent, and environmental factors resulting in
   disease. This understanding is fundamental for developing effective
   disease prevention and control strategies. Center investigators also
   evaluate the impact of disease on wildlife population dynamics, model
   environmental factors influencing disease outbreaks, and explore the
   pathogenesis of disease agents in susceptibile hosts. Other Center
   research is directed towards developing enhances technology for disease
   detection and diagnosis and developing biologics to protect animals
   against infection.
