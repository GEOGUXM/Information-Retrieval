         Prevention of Significant Deterioration Permits Information
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) prepares Prevention of
   Significant Deterioration (PSD) permits for new construction and
   modification projects involving sufficiently large quantities of
   potential pollutant emissions. This permit program has been delegated
   to Ecology by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
   Ecology PSD permits are developed pursuant to the Prevention of
   Significant Deterioration regulations set forth in Title 40, Code of
   Federal Regulations, Part 52 and regulations set forth in the
   Washington Administrative Code 173-400-141. The owner or operator of
   the facility begins the process by meeting with Ecology and others to
   discuss the application content requirements and methodologies for
   dispersion modeling and determination of Best Available Control
   Technology (BACT) to be used to minimize pollutant emissions.  The
   applicant then submits an application that contains all the necessary
   technical information to determine what level of control technology and
   emission limitations constitute BACT and that the pollutant emissions
   will not significantly impact the environment. After Ecology has
   developed a permit that it believes satisfies all regulatory
   requirements, a draft is released along with a technical fact sheet for
   a thirty-day public review and comment period. Electronic copies of
   permits, and related fact sheets are available on this web-site. At the
   end of the comment period, any public comments received are considered
   toward relevant alterations of the draft permit, a response summary is
   drafted for the comments, and a final permit is issued. Final permits
   and responsiveness summaries are available on the web-site for thirty
   days after permit finalization. Please note that certain electric power
   generation projects are under the jurisdiction of the Washington Energy
   Facility Site Evaluation Council (EFSEC). While Ecology is a contractor
   for development of the PSD permit, all information requests must be
   processed through EFSEC. EFSEC maintains a separate Internet site for
   accessing information regarding the sources under its jurisdiction,
   http://www.efsec.wa.gov/.

   Comments on any permits that are open for public comment can be mailed
   to the indicated Ecology contact, Washington Department of Ecology,
   P.O. Box 47600, Olympia, WA 98504-7600.
