    [1. CORC Participants Meeting ]

   Adam Chandler and Dan Foley attended the first meeting of participants
   in the OCLC Cooperative Online Resource Catalog (CORC) Project, held at
   the Online Computer Library Center in Dublin, Ohio, on April 26th and
   27th. As mentioned in the Issue #2 of this newsletter, CORC is a
   project sponsored by OCLC to develop software for the shared cataloging
   of Internet resources with Dublin Core (DC) and USMARC metadata. The
   project will use the Resource Description Framework (RDF) written in
   Extensible Markup Language (XML), although HTML format will also be
   available.

   There were 86 meeting attendees representing some 55 libraries
   (including the EE-IR Center) that are testing CORC software. The first
   day's meetings consisted of a general overview session, breakout
   sessions with each participant selecting three out of ten possible
   interest group meetings to attend, and another general session to
   present findings of interest groups to the entire group. Topics
   included DC, USMARC, digital library management, the CORC
   system/interface, authority control of names and subjects, and
   cartography and images. Chandler, Foley, and others attending the
   cartographic and images session expressed interest in CORC support for
   an RDF for Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) metadata.

   The second day's meetings were in the morning only and of a more
   general nature. Participants met in small assigned groups to discuss
   CORC priorities and directions. The findings of these meetings were
   presented to a final general session. Throughout, there were frequent
   opportunities to speak and network with library colleagues and OCLC
   personnel. Chandler and Foley felt that this first meeting was very
   productive. There will be further CORC participant meetings at OCLC in
   the future, as well as a CORC update presentation at the annual meeting
   of the American Library Association in New Orleans on June 28th.

   The official notes from the meeting are available at:
   http://www.oclc.org/oclc/research/projects/corc/about/corcmeeting.htm

   Also, Dan Foley and Adam Chandler have posted for comment a draft
   research report related to the CORC project, titled "Mapping Federal
   Geographic Data Committee Compliant Metadata In and Out of CORC." It is
   available on the web at:

    [3. Metadata Creation Options ]

   MetaMaker 2.22
   http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/metamaker/download.html
   The National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) program
   MetaMaker is free for downloading. The NBII MetaMaker Fact sheet is at
   http://www.nbii.gov/factsheet/factsheet5.html . NBII MetaMaker Version
   2.22 is compliant with the FGDC Draft Content Standard for NBII
   Metadata (December 1995) and the Content Standard for Digital
   Geospatial Metadata (June 1995),
   http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/contstan.html. MetaMaker was developed
   using Microsoft Access Version 2.0, but does not require Access to run.
   NOAA Metadata Collector v2.0 Extension
   http://www.csc.noaa.gov/metadata/text/download.html
   The NOAA Metadata Collector Extension is free for downloading. The
   extension provides dialogs for creating FGDC compliant metadata for
   most data types supported by ArcView GIS including ARC/INFO coverages,
   shapefiles, and image formats. The extension automatically extracts
   bounding coordinates, spatial data organization information, and
   attribute information. The information is stored in .dbf and text
   (.txt) files that can be edited. The application generates output in
   both text and HTML formats.

   Spatial Metadata Management System (SMMS) 2.0
   http://www.enabletech.com/html/smms/SMMS.htm.
   Enabling Technology, Inc. (ETI), offers a fully functional, FGDC
   compliant metadata management tool called Spatial Metadata Management
   System (SMMS). Features include metadata templates, search and query
   capabilities, and management reports. SMMS maintains metadata as your
   central reference for spatial data. The full version of this tool costs
   over $500 dollars.

   Corpsmet95
   http://corpsgeo1.usace.army.mil/
   Corpsmet95 is a metadata creation tool developed for the U.S. Army
   Corps of Engineers. It is public domain software.

   Text Editor
   It is also possible to use a plain text editor to create FGDC compliant
   metadata.

    [4. Hypoxia Scientific Assessment Reports Available ]

   The Hypoxia scientific assessment reports are now available on the web
   at http://www.nos.noaa.gov/products/pubs_hypox.html

   The EPA, in coordination with NOS and NOAA, invite public comments on
   the six topical scientific assessment reports on the causes and
   consequences of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. The six topic papers
   will be used by the CENR Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Working Group to
   prepare an Integrated Assessment which will provide ecological and
   economic analysis of various options for reducing nutrient loads
   carried by the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico. This Integrated
   Assessment will be delivered to the President, Congress and the
   Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force.

   DATES: Comments must be received by AUGUST 2, 1999. All comments
   received after the formal comment period will be reviewed by the Gulf
   of Mexico Hypoxia Working Group and delivered to the Mississippi
   River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force for their
   consideration along with the final Integrated Assessment.

   ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted to: Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia
   Working Group National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, WS 13446
   SSMC4, 1305 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910.
