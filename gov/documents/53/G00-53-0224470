   Technical Document and Research Center

   The Technical Document and Research Center supports the mission of the
   Department of Natural Resources & Parks through the provision of
   research and current awareness services.  The Technical Document
   collection consists of more than 4,000 technical reports produced by
   King County agencies, particularly the Department of Natural Resources
   & Parks and the Department of Transportation.  The book collection
   includes materials on a variety of natural resources and transportation
   topics, as well as general interest materials.  The Research Center
   exists primarily to support the work of the Department of Natural
   Resources & Parks, but is open to members of the public.

   Research Center hours are by appointment only.
