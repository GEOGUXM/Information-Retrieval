   SNIFS Background Subtraction Requirements & Methods G. Aldering
   Institute for Nuclear and Particle Astrophysics, E. O. Lawrence
   Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720. Abstract The
   background-subtraction methodology for supernova studies with SNIFS is
   discussed, with the goal of providing sufficient background on the
   methodology to allow the SNfactory collaboration to make the best
   choice regarding the need for additional sky-subtraction optics for the
   red and/or blue spectroscopy channels. It is shown that, in the absence
   of unmodeled errors, supernova photometry requires only that a final
   reference observation be obtained with SNIFS, and that the relative
   shapes of the PSF's of the spectrograph and imager channels be
   determined. A solution to the later problem - based on reconstruction
   of the wavefront error using defocused stellar images - is outlined,
   but not explored in detail. The sky subtraction needs for galaxy
   studies are also discussed. Minimal galaxy studies should be possible
   in the blue without sky-subtraction optics. However, detailed studies,
   especially in the red, require sky-subtraction optics. An alternative
   to implementation of skysubtraction optics includes use of more
   suitable ancillary instrumentation. This loses the advanatage of
   parallel observations of the host galaxies which SNIFS provides, but
   may in any case be dictated by the high signal-to-noise required for
   the study of, e.g., the galaxy ages and abundances. 1 The Nature of the
   Background The primary goal of the SNIFS instrument is to produce
   spectrophotometry for its target SNe. For each observation, SNIFS will
   produce a spectral image of a supernova (SN) superposed on its host
   galaxy and the foreground night sky. This requires the subtraction of
   the combined light of the host galaxy and the night sky. The host
   galaxy component can range from smooth and faint to highly-structured
   and bright. This component is intrinsically stable, but will be blurred
   to varying extents by atmospheric seeing. The night sky is spatially
   smooth at optical wavelengths (over scales of arcminutes), but the
   spectral shape and amplitude can vary over a large range depending on
   auroral activity, the amount of moonlight, and ecliptic coordinates.
   Leinert et al. (1998) describe the properties of the night sky in some
   detail. As shown in Fig. 1, the OH emission lines dominate the sky
   spectrum in the red. These lines are quite variable on timescales of
   minutes (Glazebrook & Bland-Hawthorn, 2001). There are also numerous
   atmospheric absorption features in the red due to O2 and H2O; the
   strength and structure of these features will vary with airmass and
   meteorological conditions. The blue spectral region is relatively free
   of strong emission lines at sites free of light pollution (Osterbrock &
   Martel, 1992; Osterbrock et al., 1996; Osterbrock, Fulbright, & Bida,
   1997; Osterbrock et al., 2000), however, it will contain numerous
   absorption features due to scattered sunlight both at low ecliptic
   latitudes or when the moon is up. Sunlight reflected off the moon or
   interplanetary dust is reddened slightly, however, once it gets
   scattered in the atmosphere it is quite blue since Rayleigh scattering
   - and to some extent aerosal 1 Figure 1: Spectrum of the dark night
   sky; note the logarithmic scaling scattering - preferentially scatter
   blue light. The bottom line is that the sky spectrum for each SN
   observation will be different, and sky subtraction based on models or
   templates is insufficient. 2 Background subtraction techniques for SNe
   2.1 Interpolation A fairly standard technique for subtracting the
   background is based on using the background well away from the source
   to interpolate the background at the source location. For SNe located
   on a very smooth low-order background, this may be adequate. This would
   occur in the case of SNe situated far from their host galaxies. This
   method is unlikely to be adequate for SNe imbedded in the disk of a
   spiral galaxy or located in the very steep inner portion of an
   elliptical galaxy. Interpolation techniques are well known, so
   implimentation details will not be discussed further other than to note
   that basis functions which have better physical motivation than
   polynomials (such as exponential, de Vacouleurs, or Sersic profiles
   with positivity constraints) might prove advantageous. 2 2.2 Final
   reference spectral image In the case of broadband photometry of SNe a
   deep image of the host galaxy is obtained without the SN present and
   then for all the images of the SN it is scaled in flux and subtracted.
   In some cases a sufficiently good image of the host galaxy prior to the
   SN event exists. More often, an image is taken after the SN has faded;
   a waiting period of roughly one year after the SN explosion is
   sufficient. These images are referred to as "final reference images."
   The SNfactory will require final reference images for all its SNe since
   spectral imaging like that of SNIFS will not have been obtained prior
   to the SNe explosions. A further complication in subtracting a final
   reference image is that the resolution of the SN image and the final
   reference image must be made to match via convolution. In the case of
   spectral imaging, this requires the same wavelength as well as spatial
   resolution. As long as the SN and final reference images are obtained
   with SNIFS, the wavelength resolution will be very nearly the same.
   However, atmospheric seeing and optical aberrations (due to Seidel
   aberrations as well as optical misalignment and focusing errors) will
   result in different spatial resolutions. 2.3 Methodology Let us denote
   the optical point spread function at the location of the spectrograph
   microlens array as Ps(xs; ys; *; tj). xs; ys indicate the image
   location on the microlens array, * is the wavelength of observation,
   and tj denotes a specific time interval in which the spectrograph and
   imager are simultaneously observing. (Spatial and wavelength resolution
   set by the spectrograph optics will not be considered here since these
   spatial and spectral resolution terms are not very time-dependent and
   are generally easy to measure from arc lines.) Let us further denote
   the optical point spread function for the i 2 f1; :::; N g filters of
   the photometry channel as Pp(xp; yp; *i; tj). Both PSF's will have a
   common component due to atmospheric seeing, A(*; tj ) as well as a
   components, Os(xs; ys; *; tj) and Op(xp; yp; *i; tj) due to optical
   elements (telescope, filters, mirrors, lenses, etc.). That is, we can
   write Ps(xs; ys; *; tj) = A(*; tj ) \Omega Os(xs; ys; *; tj ) and
   Pp(xp; yp; *i; tj) = A(*i; tj) \Omega Op(xp; yp; *i; tj) It is expected
   that the widths, W , of these terms will satisfy W (Os) , W (Op) o/ W
   (A) for all xs; ys; xp; yp; *; and tj, but this has yet to be
   demonstrated. The host galaxy spectral image is assumed to be time
   independent, and will be denoted as G(x; y; *). The supernova itself is
   simply a delta function, FSN (*; tj )ffi(xSN ; ySN), spatially
   convolved with Ps. (Note that in the current configuration the
   supernovae cannot be observed simultaneously on both the spectrograph
   and imager.) The sky, S(*; tj), is assumed to have no spatial
   structure. The available data will be a set of M SN spectral images:
   Isj = Ps(xs; ys; *; tj) \Omega [FSN (*; tj )ffi(xSN ; ySN ) + G(x; y;
   *) + S(*; tj)] 3 a set of photometry channel images filled with
   anonymous non-variable stars: Ipj = Pp(xp; yp; *i; tj) \Omega "X k
   F\Lambda k (*)ffi(x\Lambda k ; y\Lambda k ) + S(*i; tj)# and a final
   reference spectral image: Isr = Ps(xs; ys; *; tr) \Omega [G(x; y; *) +
   S(*; tr)] : If a separate sky channel is implemented, if will provide
   spectral images of blank sky: Issoj = Psso(xsso; ysso; *; tj) \Omega
   S(*; tj); Issor = Psso(xsso; ysso; *; tr) \Omega S(*; tr): The
   sky-subtraction optics (SSO) module may produce slightly difference
   wavelength resolution, but that can be treated separately. Using this
   dataset we wish to solve for the values of FSN (*; tj ) for j 2 f1;
   :::; M g. Recalling that the convolution of a sum equals the sum of
   convolutions (i.e., convolution is distributive under addition), and
   that we have assumed that there is no spatial structure in the sky, the
   sky can be taken out of the spatial convolution. Enforcing
   normalization on the PSF-related spatial convolution kernals at each *
   (which in practice must be accomplished using calibration) then gives:
   Isj = Ps(xs; ys; *; tj) \Omega [FSN (*; tj )ffi(xSN ; ySN ) + G(x; y;
   *)] + S(*; tj) Ipj = Pp(xp; yp; *i; tj) \Omega X k F\Lambda k
   (*)ffi(x\Lambda k ; y\Lambda k ) + S(*i; tj); Isr = Ps(xs; ys; *; tr)
   \Omega G(x; y; *) + S(*; tr); and Issoj = S(*; tj); Issor = S(*; tr):
   It is apparent that in the general case FSN (*; tj) cannot be measured
   from Isj alone. If G = 0, interpolative sky subtraction can be
   performed since S has no spatial structure. The ideal general case will
   be established and treated first. In general one obtains FSN (*;
   tj)ffi(xSN ; ySN ) = 1P s(xs; ys; *; tj) \Omega I sj \Gamma Issoj
   \Gamma G(x; y; *): The host galaxy is given by G(x; y; *) = 1P s(xs;
   ys; *; tr) \Omega I sr \Gamma Issor ; which leads to FSN (*; tj
   )ffi(xSN ; ySN ) = ^ 1P s(xs; ys; *; tj) \Omega I sj \Gamma 1P s(xs;
   ys; *; tr) \Omega I sr * \Gamma \Theta Issoj \Gamma Issor \Lambda 4
   upon substituion. In practice deconvolution is ill-posed, and in this
   case it is unnecessary. Rather than performing a spatial deconvolution
   it is sufficient to spatially convolve the image with the best PSF to
   match the image with the worst PSF for each j; r pair. For simplicity,
   it will be assumed that the PSF for the final reference spectral image
   is as good as the best SN spectral image, that is, that W (Ps(xs; ys;
   *; tr)) ^ W (Ps(xs; ys; *; tj)) for j 2 f1; :::; M g: Then there will
   be a spatial convolution (as opposed to deconvolution) kernal, Ks(xs;
   ys; *; tj;r) = Ps(xs; ys; *; tj) \Omega 1P s(xs; ys; *; tr) which can
   be used to blur the reference observations to the spatial resolution of
   the SN observations. This approach gives FSN (*; tj )Ps(xSN ; ySN ; *;
   tj) = \Theta Isj \Gamma Ks(xs; ys; *; tj;r) \Omega Isr \Lambda \Gamma
   \Theta Issoj \Gamma Issor \Lambda : Note again that, under the
   assumption that the sky has no spatial structure, spatial convolutions
   can be performed on images which have not been sky-subtracted. The
   image resulting from executing only the first half of the above
   equation is expected to be spatially flat except for the presence of
   the SN, therefore the SN alone can be measured by interpolative
   subtraction of structureless background. That is, FSN (*; tj )Ps(xSN ;
   ySN ; *; tj) = \Theta Isj \Gamma Ks(xs; ys; *; tj;r) \Omega Isr \Lambda
   \Gamma F(*); where F(*) j S(*; tj) \Gamma S(*; tr) is a function of
   wavelength but has no spatial dependence. This is a critical point
   since it means that -- technically speaking -- sky-subtraction optics
   are not required for the purposes of SN spectro-photometry. Note also
   that the quality of the result can be judged by whether all structure
   other than the SN has been eliminated after the first half of the above
   equation is calculated. Such evaluation is necessary since Ps(xs; ys;
   *; tj) and Ps(xs; ys; *; tr) are not known quantities; they must be
   estimated from the SN or other point sources in the 600 \Theta 600
   spectrograph field of view or from the Pp(xpk ; ypk ; *i; tj) and
   Pp(xpk ; ypk ; *i; tr) measured in the photometry channel. This latter
   approach is discussed in the Appendix. 3 Sky Subtraction Needs for
   Galaxy Studies Supernova host-galaxy redshifts are required as part of
   the main SNfactory science program. In addition, there is scientific
   interest in the study of the intrinsic properties of these host
   galaxies. Finally, University of Hawaii observers may have their own
   interests in studying extended sources. Without subtraction of the
   night sky, the range of possible studies becomes limited. In the blue,
   where the sky is not highly structured, it will be possible to measure
   absorptionand emission-line redshifts, as well as velocity dispersions,
   without sky subtraction. Emission line luminosities and ratios (but not
   equivalent widths) can also be measured by interpolating in wavelength
   around features of interest. However, absorption-line abundance and age
   studies will be at the mercy of sky subtraction errors. A correct
   estimate of the sky level will be possible only if the outer lenses of
   the IFU are free of galaxy light. In the red (see Fig. 1) it may be
   difficult to perform any meaningful analysis of the host galaxy without
   sky subtraction due to the highly structured and variable nature of the
   OH emission. Key 5 lines such as Hff and the Ca II triplet would be
   difficult to work with for all but the brightest or most compact
   galaxies. Since galaxies are centrally-concentrated, one could
   eliminate the sky contribution while retaining some of the galaxy
   contribution by subtracting the spectra of the outer lenses of the IFU.
   The amount by which the galaxy signal is erroneously suppressed will
   depend on how much galaxy light is in the periphery of the IFU field
   compared to the center. With this approach, galaxy redshifts probably
   could be measured in the red for most SN host galaxies. As redshifts
   are the only SNfactory requirement for host galaxies, and because it is
   plausible that redshifts can be measured without proper sky
   subtraction, the SNfactory could consider a separate sky-subtraction
   optical channel unnecessary. Indeed, for more detailed host-galaxies
   studies it might prove more effective to use other instrumentation
   better suited to these tasks. For instance, experience with long-slit
   spectrographic observations of SN host galaxies from the SCP's Spring
   1999 Nearby Campaign indicates that for the spectra of typical SN host
   galaxies taken near the SN location integration times of many hours on
   4-m class telescopes are necessary to begin to undertake meaningful age
   and abundance studies. For the sake of discussion, assume 20 SNIFS
   observations of 10 minutes each per SN; this gives a total integration
   on the host galaxy equivalent to one hour on a 4-m class telescope. For
   measurement of the bulk galaxy properties, all the pupil spectra with
   galaxy light can be included, perhaps quadrupling the effective
   integration compared to those from a long-slit spectrograph. These
   rough calculations suggest that for typical host galaxies the SNfactory
   observations are not going to provide detailed measurements of the host
   galaxy at the SN location, and may be barely sufficient to provide
   information on the intrinsic bulk properties of the SN hosts. 4
   Conclusion on Sky-Subtraction Optics In summary, for the study of the
   SNe themselves, sky-subtraction optics are not needed as long as final
   reference observations with SNIFS are available to subtract from the
   SNIFS SN observations. This conclusion must be tempered by the
   possibility that calibration errors may result in skysubtraction errors
   which have not been modeled here. Furthermore, age and abundance
   studies of SN host galaxies require that SNIFS have skysubtraction
   optics or that the SNfactory should employ other instrumentation (e.g.
   VIMOS) more suited to this task. Without sky-subtraction optics
   redshift determination, velocity dispersion studies, and emission-line
   luminosity studies in the blue should still be possible. In the red,
   even these - more limited - studies will be difficult without
   sky-subtraction optics. References Glazebrook, K. & Bland-Hawthorn, J.

   1993, Optical Society of America Journal, 10, 2277 A Determining
   relative spatial convolution kernals From the previous discussion,
   recall that spectro-photometry of each SN requires that the quantity
   Ks(xs; ys; *; tj;r) be determined for all tj 2 f1; :::; M g. Although
   it is relatively straightforward to assess whether the correct Ksj;r
   have been chosen when high S=N data are available, finding the correct
   Ksj;r to start with is not trivial, and for low S=N data feedback on
   the quality of the result will be weak. Here the groundwork is laid for
   a more general approach to determining Ksj;r . A.1 Using the imager PSF
   to estimate the spectrograph PSF One possible approach would be to
   measure anonymous stars before and after the SN observation taken at tj
   and the final reference observation taken at tr. The difficultly here
   is that the atmospheric seeing component, A, of the PSF will not be
   sufficiently stable to guarantee that the calibration PSF matches the
   SN or final reference PSF. The SNIFS imager will observe a field of
   anonymous field star while the spectrograph is observing the SN. Thus,
   an estimate of Ksj;r over specific wavelength ranges can be formulated
   as: Ks(xs; ys; *; tj;r) = Ps(xs; ys; *; tj ) \Omega 1P s(xs; ys; *; tr)
   = A(*i; tj) \Omega Os(xs; ys; *i; tj) \Omega 1A(* i; tr) \Omega Os(xs;
   ys; *i; tr) Rewriting this in terms of Fourier transforms givese Ksj;r
   = ePs je Psr = e Aj eOsje Ar eOsr = h e Ppj = eOpj i eOsjh e Ppr = eOpr
   i eOsr = " ePp je Ppr # " e Osje Osr # " e Opre Opj # where the
   function parameters and their Fourier counterparts have been suppressed
   for ease of notation. ePpj = ePpr can be measured from the photometry
   channel. So, if the ratio of the spectrograph and photometer eO's are
   known at the time of observation (tj or tr), or if the ratio of eO's at
   two different times (tj and tr) for each instrument are known, then a
   measurement of Ksj;r needed for SN spectro-photometry can be made for
   descrete wavelength ranges, *i. All P 's and O's also must be
   interpolated to the focal-plane location of the SN, xSN ; ySN . The PSF
   is expected to be a slowly and smoothly varying function of *,
   interpolation should provide Ksj;r over the full wavelength range of
   the spectro-photometric observations. It is possible that the ratios of
   the O's will be fairly stable over time. Also, the widths, W (O), are
   expected to be narrow, so their Fourier transforms should be very wide.
   The error made by simply ignoring changes in the O's is given by: ffl =
   T \Gamma 1 " eG ePpje Ppr # e Osje Osr e Opre Opj \Gamma 1!! 7 where T
   \Gamma 1 denotes the inverse Fourier transform. A.2 Measurement of
   optical transfer function from defocused phase maps If it turns out
   that the optical transfer functions, Os and Op, are not negligable
   relative to the atmospheric transfer function, A, and that Os and/or Op
   are not stable, then they will have to measured as part of the
   calibration procedure. One method of measuring the O's is using the
   phase map method of (Roddier & Roddier, 1993). In this method an image
   of a star is obtained on either side of focus. The image (or spectral
   image) is that of the illumination beam pattern before and after the
   optical pupil, and the intensity variations reveal changes in the total
   curvature of the wavefront. The wavefront phase map which is the
   Fourier transform of the desired optics PSF, O, can then be
   reconstructed. The size of the defocused image will be limited to
   600for the spectrograph -- some experimentation will be needed to
   determine whether this is sufficient. 8
