Strategic Plan
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Office of the Professions has reviewed its strategic plan to ensure
   that it complements the Board of Regents strategic plan and is relevant
   to today's needs. We developed our first plan in 1996 with State board
   members, professional associations, consumers, and others.

   In reviewing our plan, we have:
     * revalidated our strategic goals
     * streamlined our vision and mission to reflect their essential
       elements
     * added our values, which drive the way staff work together and with
       Office customers.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                   VISION

   A regulatory system that promotes the highest quality of professional
   services for public protection.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                   MISSION

   To protect the public by fostering high standards of professional
   licensure, practice and discipline.
     __________________________________________________________________

                               STRATEGIC GOALS

     * The credentialing and discipline processes are fair, prompt, clear,
       and accurate.
     * Accurate information will be provided promptly in a clear and
       courteous manner to customers, licensees, and the interested
       public.
     * Policies, practice interpretations, standards, decisions, and
       processes for the licensed professions balance the needs and
       concerns of consumers and professionals, consistent with the law.
     * All staff are informed, share in decision-making, are clear about
       their roles, have meaningful responsibility and opportunity to
       contribute, and have training to develop their potential.
     * Partnerships are developed to promote diversity and increase
       awareness of careers in the licensed professions.
