      Electroactive Polymer Actuators* - JPL's NDEAA Technologies Website

*Artificial Muscles

   This homepage is the electroactive polymer actuators website of the
   JPL's NDEAA Technologies.

   Electroactive polymers (EAP) are being developed to enable effective,
   miniature, inexpensive, light and miser actuators for planetary
   applications. Various EAP materials, also called artificial muscles,
   are being investigated and new methods of characterizing them are being
   developed. A series of applications were demonstrated and can be seen
   on the EAP-in-Action homepage (video clippings). These applications
   include surface wiper, robotic arm components (lifter and gripper) and
   haptic interface. The surface wiper was demonstrated to be effective in
   removing minute dust particles and it was selected in 1999 as a
   baseline technology for the MUSES-CN mission. Initial plans involved
   the use of a pair of EAP surface wipers for dust removal from the
   visual/IR window of the Nanorover. The MUSES-CN flight project is the
   world's first asteroid sample return mission and it is a collaboration
   between Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Sciences and NASA,
   and is scheduled for launch in January 2002.
   SPIE EAP book Even though the EAP surface wiper is not included in the
   final design due to the mission budget cut and tight mass constraints,
   the initial selection of EAP for the mission has been a major milestone
   that led to a worldwide recognition of the potential of these
   materials.
   The material that was used for bending the surface wiper is known as
   IPMC (Ion-exchange Polymer Metal Composite) and our study indicates
   that there are many challenges that still need to be overcome before
   the material can be transition to space flight. These challenges
   include: permanent deformation of the material under DC voltage, the
   material dehydrates though the protective coating, and electrolysis
   takes place during activation above 1.23-V.

   In recognition of the limitations of EAP as actuators and artificial
   muscles, Dr. Bar-Cohen initiated an SPIE International Conference on
   the subject, which was held in Newport Beach, CA on March 1-2, 1999.
   Also, a webpage was formed to link the various EAP websites worldwide:
