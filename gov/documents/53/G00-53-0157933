   CAPR60-1 available 04 Nov 2001.
   Take test online through National's e-business section. THIS test is
   now required for ALL Form 5's. You may download this test, but the
   online test does not appear to work.

   CAPR60-3/60-4/60-5 now available.

  New CAPT 116 - 7/01

    1. A new CAPT 116 has been published as an on-line test. It is
       available at
       https://data.ntc.cap.gov/ntc/ops/tests/default.cfm
    2. If that link doesn't work, try:
       http://data.ntc.cap.gov/ntc/ops/tests/default.cfm
    3. The new CAPR 60-3 requires all personnel holding a CAPF 101 card to
       retake the CAPT 116 within 180 days from the issuance of a new
       version of the test. (CAPR 60-3, para 2-3.a). To the best of my
       knowledge it as not yet been released in written form, so I do not
       believe the clock is counting down yet, however those who wish to
       get the test out of the way can.
    4. After the on-line test has been taken, a certificate can be printed
       and the printed certificate is your proof of passing the test.
       Please send a copy of the certificate to wing and maintain the
       original for the members ES record.
