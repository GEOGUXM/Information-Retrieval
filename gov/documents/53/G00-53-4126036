                                  JURY TERM

     Jurors are required to be available for jury duty for a two-week
     period. If selected for a trial, jurors will be required to serve
     for the duration of the trial. The average length of a trial is two
     days, however, some are longer. At the outset of jury selection,
     jurors will be told the expected length of the trial and may ask the
     judge to be excused if the length of trial would cause the juror
     undue hardship.

                        REPORTING FOR DUTY & SERVICE

     Because trials are sometimes postponed or cases settled shortly
     before trial date, our Court uses a "phone in" system to inform
     jurors when their service is required. If the Answer Phone system is
     to work effectively, jurors must understand and observe the
     following:

     1. -- Each juror must call 592-9261 after 5:30 PM on the evening
     before each scheduled trial date to confirm whether or not to report
     for duty the next morning.

     2. -- Juror's may place their calls anytime between 5:30 PM and 8:30
     AM. The recording will tell the juror whether or not he/she is
     needed and the time to report. Listen carefully -- the instructions
     will change from day to day depending on the number oftrials
     scheduled.

     On the days reporting for service, jurors must scan in when arriving
     and scan out at the end of each day. Once jurors have checked in, a
     number of jury panels may be selected and sent to the various
     Divisions of the Court. If a juror is excused for any reason by the
     Judge of the Division, the juror must always report back to the Jury
     Lounge for further instructions. Likewise, after a jury has been
     selected and sworn in, those individuals not selected must report
     back to the Jury Lounge for further instructions. Jurors must remain
     in the Pool until all judges have selected their jurors for the
     day.. The Jury Pool Administrator will discharge the Pool when the
     process is completed.

     While a juror is actually serving on a case, it is not necessary to
     scan in and out. Jurors must follow instructions of the Judge. The
     juror will remain on the case until the trial is completed and
     he/she is discharged by the Judge. The juror should notcall the
     Answer Phone until he/she has been released from the trial by the
     Judge and he/she is again a part of the general Jury Pool.

                                  ABSENCES

     As a general Pool member a juror may request to be exclude from
     service for a single day should it cause undue hardship. The juror
     may see a Jury Pool Staff member or call our office at 592- 9261
     between 9:30 AM and 4:30 PM at least a day prior to the day needed
     to be excused, if possible. But when a juror is called to a
     Courtroom for jury selection, he/she must mention his/her
     pre-planned appointments or "excuse" BEFORE he/she is sworn in as a
     juror. Once selected to serve on a case, a juror cannot be excused
     for pre-planned appointments. Any juror who is absent on any
     assigned reporting day, without being excused by the judge under
     which he/she is serving, is guilty of direct contempt of court
     (Article 222, LA Code of Civil Procedure), and is subject to a
     substantial fine or imprisonment or both.

                                  JURY FEE

     The juror will be paid $16.00 for each day he/she actually serves on
     a jury. The check will be issued at the completion of the trial.

                                 [line9.gif]

                             TRANSPORTATION FEE

     $4.00 per day. You will be required to sign an Attendance Ledger
     each day if you wish to receive the Transportation Fee. The Court
     will mail you this check several weeks after your Jury Term has
     ended. You will be reimbursed the $4.00 per day only if you are
     available for service in accordance with the Answer Phone
     instructions. All Jurors will receive the $4.00 per day fee
     regardless of your mode of transportation. YOU SHOULD NOT PARK AT A
     PARKING METER. The $4.00 per day allowance is enough to cover the
     cost of parking in most lots in the area. The Court will not be
     responsible for any parking violation tickets. in precedence.
