  Neurons in different regions within the visual system carry out different
aspects of visual pattern analysis needed for visual perception. This project
    involves discovering how and where the pieces that make up a visually
  perceived object are brought together and integrated. The latency before
 neurons start firing after pattern presentation is one important aspect of
the time structure of a neuronal message. We find that the latency indicates
how easily the pattern can be seen, and the intensity of firing--the response
strength--is a code indicating what the pattern is. Finding that the latency
   is related to how easily the pattern can be perceived suggests that the
 features within a pattern are grouped. We construct a model to show how the
   neuronal signals entering the visual cortex from the lateral geniculate
 nucleus can be combined to make this feature grouping occur. When inferior
temporal cortical neurons respond to a pattern obscured by visual noise, the
 time it takes for the monkey to respond to the pattern correctly is closely
 predicted by the time it takes for the neuronal messages to indicate which
 pattern is present. Our results at both ends of the visual cortical streams
suggest there is a valid stimulus pattern template that gates these neuronal
   responses. All of these findings taken together suggest that the visual
system is transmitting signals that describe messages that encode stimuli as
   complex, integrated objects from the earliest cortical stages, and this
   integration becomes more general as the signals pass to later stages of
                             visual processing.

In our studies of motivation, we have found that monkeys work faster and with
fewer errors when a cue indicates that a reward will be delivered immediately
 after the next correct response than when the cue indicates that additional
    trials will follow. Single neurons in the ventral striatum signal the
rewarded trial when it follows one or more unrewarded trials, thus providing
a neural signal that could reinforce complex behavior. The neuronal responses
are directly related to the associative learning of the meaning of the cue in
   a complex behavioral task. Specifically, the neurons track the animal's
  chronological course of a behavioral sequence that ultimately leads to a
reward. Neurons located 3-4 mm away in area TE of the temporal cortex fail to
     show this effect. Neurons in the perirhinal cortex are gated by the
motivational state of the animal. Thus we hypothesize that dopaminergic input
    provides signals sensitive to long-term progress through a planned or
 expected series of tasks which culminate in reward. Disorders of motivation
    accompany many serious psychiatric and neurological disorders. Also,
pharmacological agents that interfere with normal motivational processes have
    a devastating effect on individual behavior. This project studies the
  mechanisms that underlie motivational behavior with the goal of designing
 strategies for more effective treatments for those disorders that adversely
                          affect normal motivation.
