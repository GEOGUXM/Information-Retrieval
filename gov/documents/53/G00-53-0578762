   About the Center

   The USGS Center for Coastal Geology

   U.S. Geological Survey

Research Program

   The Center investigates geologic processes related to societal problems
   arising in coastal and marine environments including natural hazards,
   resources, and environmental change. Increased understanding of these
   topics will provide the basis for predicting future coastal erosion,
   the fate of wetlands, accumulation of sediments, sediment transport and
   stability, circulation, movement of pollution through aqueous
   environments, and the locations of economically valuable hard minerals.
   The Center is part of the USGS National Coastal and Marine Geology
   Program with cooperating marine centers in Woods Hole, Massachusetts,
   and Menlo Park, California, and works closely with faculty and students
   of the University of South Florida Department of Marine Science on
   problems critical to the mission of the agency.

   With our strong cooperation with USF, and our outstanding facilities,
   the Center for Coastal and Regional Marine Studies has become a model
   for other USGS research centers around the country.

Personnel

   At present, the Center employs approximately 100 research and support
   personnel. Research and support staff includes:
     * Biologists and ecologists who study estuarine invertebrates and
       fish, and shallow coastal ecosystems, including salt marshes and
       mangroves, allowing the Center to integrate ecosystem and
       environmental issues into its interdisciplinary research
     * Coastal geologists who investigate the evolution of coastlines and
       coastal landforms, the health and evolution of reefs, and the
       sediment dynamics of lagoons and estuaries
     * Oceanographers who investigate waves, currents, and sediment
       transport
     * Remote sensing scientists who utilize aircraft and satellites to
       investigate water quality, sediment movement, shoreline and
       wetlands erosion, and water circulation
     * Paleontologists who investigate microscopic fossil plants and
       animals in order to determine the age and environment of their
       deposition with sediments and to infer past climate
     * Coastal hazards scientists who study and forecast the geologic and
       economic impacts of hurricanes, coastal floods, and coastline
       changes
     * Engineers and electronic specialists who develop and maintain
       drilling and geophysical instrumentation used in a wide variety of
       field investigations including sonar, seafloor, and sub-bottom
       imaging

Facilities

   In 1988, the USGS Center for Coastal and Regional Marine Studies was
   established in cooperation with the Department of Marine Sciences at
   the University of South Florida (USF). The Center occupies 45,000 sq.
   ft. in the combined facilities of the historic Studebaker Building and
   the Paul J. Getting Building on the St. Petersburg campus of USF. The
   Getting Building facilities house laboratory analysis capabilities and
   a 12 meter-long recirculating flume for flow and sediment transport
   experiments.

   Under the direction of chief scientist Lisa Robbins, selected from the
   University of South Florida in May, 1999, a major renovation of the
   laboratory facilities to accommodate the biologists has been completed.
   Lab space was one of the principal design features of the new Getting
   Building, dedicated in 1996. A March 16, 2000 article in the St.
   Petersburg Times described the expansion and plans to add a new
   building to the two existing structures at 600 Fourth Street South.
   Bonnie McGregor, the Eastern Regional Director in Reston, VA, notes how
   "the community has just been tremendously supportive" of the USGS.
