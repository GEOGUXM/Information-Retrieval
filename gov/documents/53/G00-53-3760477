Building and Fire Research Laboratory

                             Fire Research Division
       _______________________________________________________________

                                                Flame Speed Measurements
         The speed of a flame is measured as increasing amounts of super-
     effective suppressant are added during the search for possible halon
                                                            replacements.

     The Fire Research Division develops, verifies, and utilizes
     measurements and predictive methods to quantify the behavior of fire
     and the means to reduce the impact of fire on people, property, and
     the environment. This work involves integration of laboratory
     measurements, verified methods of prediction, and large-scale fire
     experiments to demonstrate the use and value of the research
     products. Focused research activities develop scientific and
     engineering understanding of fire phenomena and metrology; identify
     principles and produce metrology, data, and predictive methods for
     the formation/evolution of smoke components in flames and for the
     burning of polymeric materials; and develop predictive methods to
     enable high-performance fire detection and suppression systems.
     Through the Divisions programs in measurement, prediction, systems
     integration, and the dynamics of fire and its interactions with the
     built and natural environment, the division provides leadership for
     advancing the theory and practice of fire safety engineering, fire
     fighting, fire investigation, fire testing, fire data management,
     and intentional burning. Extensive publication and technology
     transfer efforts facilitate the use of fire research results in
     practice in the fire communities in the United States. Participation
     in the codes and standards processes helps to reduce barriers to
     trade and global markets for U.S. goods and services.

  Enhanced Fire Safety
  Research Programs

     Most of the Division's research is carried out in three main
     programs:
    1. Advanced Fire Service Technology
    2. Advanced Measurement and Prediction Methods for Enhanced Fire
       Safety
    3. Reduced Risk of Flashover

     These programs benefit from collaborations with other BFRL
     divisions, divisions in other NIST laboratories, industry sponsors,
     and other government agencies. The objectives of these programs are:
     * Advanced Fire Service Technology -- Enable a shift to an
       information rich environment for safer and more effective fire
       service operations through new technology, measurement standards,
       and training tools.
     * Advanced Measurement and Prediction Methods for Enhanced Fire
       Safety -- To lead the world in fire measurement and prediction
       methods by 2006, enabling engineered fire safety for people,
       products, facilities, and first responders.
     * Reduced Risk of Flashover -- To eliminate flashover risk
       cost-effectively by adapting measurement and predictive methods to
       better understand conditions leading to flashover; to enable early
       and certain fire and environment sensing; to advance fire
       suppression technologies; and to enable new/improved materials
       whose fire resistance does not negatively impact performance, cost,
       or the environment.




  Fire Fighting Technology Group

     The Fire Fighting Technology group enables advances in fire fighter
     safety, fire ground operations, and effectiveness of the fire
     service; develops and applies technology, measurements and
     standards, and improves the understanding of the behavior,
     prevention and control of fires to enhance fire fighting operations
     and equipment, fire suppression, fire investigations, and disaster
     response.

  Fire Metrology Group

                                    Thermocouple measurements in fire test
     The uncertainty in thermocouple temperature measurements, an essential
        part of all meaningful fire tests, are quantified here under actual
                                                                conditions.

     The Fire Metrology Group applies measurement science in the
     development a nd quantification of new and existing methods for
     studying fire growth, fire induced flows, flame radiation, smoke
     formation and dynamics, species production, heat transfer, and fire
     suppression. It conducts long term basic research to develop new
     measurement paradigms and responds to short term challenges to
     address needs identified by other groups within the division. The
     group serves as division resource for quantification of measurement
     uncertainty, development of calibration standards, and best
     practices documents. The group also manages the NIST Large Fire
     Facility where advanced field scale diagnostics, real time data
     output, and quantified measurements are employed to validate models
     for fire growth, smoke dynamics, and suppression.

  Analysis and Prediction Group

     The Analysis and Prediction Group develops understanding and
     predictive methods of dynamic fire phenomena to advance fire science
     and engineering practice, reduce fire hazards, and improve fire
     protection and fire fighting. It performs research to enhance the
     understanding of the physics of fires to improve predictions of the
     growth, spread, suppression, and emissions from fires of all scales,
     and it uses experiments, analysis, metrology, and advanced computer
     simulations to improve predictions of fire phenomena.

  Integrated Performance Assessment Group

     The Integrated Performance Assessment Group produces quantitative
     tools useful to a broad base of stakeholders in the building and
     fire safety communities, including: architects and design engineers;
     manufacturers of building materials, products and furnishings; code
     developers, enforcers, and regulating authorities; and stakeholders
     exposed to direct risk such as building owners, occupants, the
     general public and the fire service. The group utilizes enhanced
     data and predictions to quantify fire events for fire hazard and
     risk assessment; for fire fighter operations, training and fire
     investigations; and performance evaluation of fire protection
     systems in buildings, transportation systems, and vehicles in
     response to fire. The group works with customers to build fire
     safety decision models making use of advancements in metrology,
     simulation, and materials; and manages the flow of research data and
     information to the fire safety community.

  Materials and Products Group

                                                     polypropylene specimen
     Polypropylene specimen undergoing gasification in absence of O[2] leads
                           to greater understanding of polymer flammability.

     The Materials and Products Group performs research to understand
     fundamentally the mechanisms that control the ignition, flame
     spread, and burning rate of materials and the chemical and physical
     characteristics that affect these aspects of flammability. It
     develops methods of measuring and predicting the response of a
     material to a fire, which includes characterizing the burning rates
     of charring and non-charring polymers and composites, delineating
     and modeling the enthalpy and mass transfer mechanisms of materials
     combustion, and developing computational molecular dynamics and
     other mechanistic approaches to understand the relationships between
     polymer structure and flammability.

  Highlights:

     * Home Smoke Alarm Tests - The purpose of the project is to determine
       if different types of fire alarms can respond to threatening
       residential fire settings in order to permit egress of typical
       groups of occupants. The ability of the alarm devices to avoid
       nuisance alarms will also be evaluated.

       of species concentrations (mole fraction), temperatures (K), and
       velocities (cm/s) are included for two diffusion flame systems.
