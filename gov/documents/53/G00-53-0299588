                             What is Project V.O.T.E.?

   Project V.O.T.E. (Voters of Tomorrow through Education)is an innovative,
   private-public partnership designed to help students become knowledgeable,
   responsible voters at an early age, and to stimulate a life-long commitment
   to the election process. This non-partisan, cooperative statewide voter
   education program promotes voter participation by introducing students to the
   mechanics of the electoral and legislative processes through hands-on
   experience. The project's objectives are to make the voting procedures easy
   to understand and to encourage students to make informed decisions.
