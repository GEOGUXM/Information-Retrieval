    What is NICEATM?

    The National Toxicology Program (NTP) at the National Institute of
   Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) created the NTP Interagency
   Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods
   (NICEATMor "the Center") in 1998.

   NICEATM provides support for the Interagency Coordinating Committee on
   the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM).  The Center organizes
   meetings and workshops for the development, review, and validation of
   alternative toxicological testing methods.  NICEATM facilitates
   information sharing among stakeholders.  NICEATM also provides an
   opportunity for public-private partnerships to enhance the level and
   scope of its activities.  ICCVAM and NICEATM initiatives implement
   Public Law 103-43 that directed NIEHS to develop a process to achieve
   regulatory acceptance of alternative test methods.

   The Center Office is located at NIEHS and comprises government
   professional and administrative staff augmented with appropriate
   contract support.   The Center collaborates with the ICCVAM to carry
   out activities to accomplish the following:
     * Communicate with interested parties, and facilitate communication
       during the development and validation process with appropriate
       agencies;
     * Assess the completeness of submissions and determine if there are
       sufficient data for test methods to undergo independent public
       scientific peer review;
     * Arrange for scientific peer reviews;
     * Organize expert panels and/or workshops to assess the validation
       status of a method or group of methods;
     * Provide recommendations and results to research and regulatory
       agencies;
     * Prepare, publish, and distribute reports and information about new
       test methods.
