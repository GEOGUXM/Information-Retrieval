About the Office

   The Office of the Director houses the Foundation's top leadership, and

   priorities to the establishment of administrative and management
   guidelines, including long-range planning.

   The positions of Director and Deputy Director are appointed by the
   President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. NSF's statutory authority
   establishes a six-year term for the Director.
