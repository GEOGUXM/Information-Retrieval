   Invasive Species Research
   The Pacific Southwest (California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona) is
   characterized by remarkable biodiversity in an unparalleled range of
   environments. But the regions biodiversity and the continued survival
   of functioning native ecosystems are threatened by the invasion of
   nonnative species. Once established, some invasive species have the
   ability to displace or replace native plant and animal species, disrupt
   nutrient and fire cycles, and cause changes in the pattern of plant
   succession.

   Under the USGS "Weeds in the West" initiative of 1998, the Western
   Ecological Research Center (WERC) began research that will improve the
   ability to detect, monitor, and predict the effects of invasive
   species. Equally important research is being conducted by WERC
   scientists on exotic animals. These studies will provide resource
   managers with the information and tools needed to better understand and
   control invasive species on the land they manage and to help them avoid
   or prevent future invasions.
