   M emorandum United States Bankruptcy Court Southern District of Georgia
   PUBLIC NOTICE FROM: Michael F. McHugh, Clerk of Court SUBJECT: Revision
   to Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, Relevant Federal Rules of
   Civil Procedure and Official Bankruptcy Forms Effective December 1,
   2001, NOTICE is given that Congress has taken no action on the
   amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil and Bankruptcy Procedure
   approved by the Supreme Court on April 23, 2001. Accordingly, the
   amendments to the rules are effective December 1, 2001, including: *
   Bankruptcy Rules 1007, 2002, 3016, 3017, 3020, 9006, 9020 and 9022; and
   * Civil Rules 5, 6, 65, 77, 81 and 82 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
   5(b) is amended to authorize service, excepting that of a summons and
   complaint, on any consenting party by electronic means. This rule
   applies to bankruptcy adversary proceedings through the application of
   Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7005, which incorporates by
   reference Civil Rule 5. Amendments to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy
   Procedure 9006(f) will conform to a December 1 amendment to Federal
   Rule of Civil Procedure 6(e) which will afford electronic service the
   additional three days, which presently is applicable to service by
   mail. Amendments to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9022(a) will
   conform to a December 1 amendment to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
   77(d), which will permit notice of entry of a judgment or order to be
   served by electronic means on consenting parties. Amendments to eight
   additional Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure also are effective on
   December 1. Further, the Judicial Conference of the United States has
   approved amendments to two Official Bankruptcy Forms. These amendments
   are effective on December 1 as well. Amendments to the following four
   Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require that when a plan contains
   injunctions, the plan proponent must give clear and conspicuous notice
   to all parties that may be affected that the plan contains injunctions,
   which may affect their rights. These amendments are to Federal Rules of
   Bankruptcy Procedure 2002(c), 3016, 3017 and 3020. They are intended to
   operate in coordination with a December 1999 amendment to Federal Rule
   of Bankruptcy Procedure 7001, which provides that no separate adversary
   proceeding need be filed to obtain an injunction that is part of a
   plan. Amendments to Official Form 15, Order Confirming a Plan, conform
   to the rules. Additional rules amendments that are effective December 1
   will create a new subdivision (m) to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy
   Procedure 1007 to require listing of the name and address of a legal
   representative of a minor or incompetent person and amend Federal Rule
   of Bankruptcy Procedure 2002(g) to provide for giving notice of events
   in a case to a minor or incompetent person. Federal Rule of Bankruptcy
   Procedure 9020, which governs the issuance of an order of contempt, has
   been amended to delete the 10-day stay and the requirement for de novo
   review by the district court. Commencing December 1, a request for an
   order of contempt will be treated as a contested matter under Federal
   Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9014. Official Form 1, the Voluntary
   Petition, is amended effective December 1, to include an Exhibit C. If
   a debtor owns or has possession of any property that poses or is
   alleged to pose a threat of imminent harm to public health or safety,
   the debtor must so indicate and attach a description of the property.
   The purpose of the amendment is to notify the United States Trustee or
   bankruptcy administrator and any case trustee of the presence of the
   hazard or potential hazard so that protective action can be taken
   forthwith.
