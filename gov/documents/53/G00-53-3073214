               ABOUT THE ElK GROVE COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT

   The Elk Grove Community Services District, or Elk Grove CSD as it is
   commonly referred to, is an innovative body of local government that
   ties Groundbreaking Photo together two of our area's integral public
   services -- fire and emergency medical services and parks and
   recreation services. A streamlined entity, the District utilizes a
   common governing body, the District's Board of Directors, and a core
   administration staff to stretch local property tax dollars farther.
   Established as a special district under Government Code Sections
   56261.1 and 56439(c) on July 1, 1985, the District was the result of a
   merger of the Elk Grove Fire Protection District and the Elk Grove
   Recreation and Park District. The District encompasses approximately
   130 square miles and serves the growing communities of Elk Grove,
   Laguna, Franklin and Sheldon -- an area population already exceeding
   67,000. The CSD operates over 40 parks and five fire stations and
   employs 120 full and over 100 part-time staff. As the area continues to
   experience steep increases in population and commerical growth, the
   District remains committed to enhancing the quality of life for those
   residing, doing business and visiting Elk Grove and its surrounding
   areas.

   ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES DEPARTMENT

   Acting as an umbrella for District operations, the Administrative
   Services Department provides guidance and support to the Board of
   Directors and other CSD staff and performs a variety of administrative
   functions. Staff in this Department are responsible for administering
   and overseeing the District's $21+ million annual budget, managing
   human resources for over 200 full and part-time District personnel,
   implementing short- and long-range District planning, maintaining
   District facilities, coordinating District-wide information systems,
   managing public information/education/relations for all three
   Departments, and administrating the District-wide Landscape and
   Lighting (L & L) Assessment District. The District's General Manager
   also operates within this Department and is responsible for
   administrating the programs and policies developed by the Board of
   Directors and overseeing operations in all three of the District's
   Departments.
