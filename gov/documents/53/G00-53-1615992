                          Statement on the tax cut
                                May 22, 2001

              Mr. President: We've been down this road before.

     As a congressman in 1981, I supported the Reagan tax cuts that were
        promoted as a cure-all for the economic ailments of that era.

   Instead, they led to year after year of increasing deficits, exploding
    national debt, and a series of tax increases enacted to stem the tide
                                 of red ink.

     With fiscal discipline and a growing economy, we reversed that tide
    just three years ago. Since 1998, we've enjoyed surpluses instead of
     deficits. And we've been paying down the debt, reducing the massive
           interest costs that have burdened America's taxpayers.

       But now, Mr. President, the government is about to dig into our
    pockets, pull out our credit cards again, and go stumbling down that
                       road toward economic calamity.

   And - with smoke and mirrors - some are trying to hide the costs we'll
                            incur along the way.

     By manipulating the starting and phase-in dates for the various tax
     cuts - and setting unlikely expiration dates on some of them - this
    bill is jury-rigged to fit within the $1.35 trillion allotted for tax
            cuts over 11 years in the Senate's budget resolution.

      But, the fact is, it won't fit once we consider other tax breaks
      already in the pipeline and spending priorities such as defense,
                  education and prescription drug benefits.

       And this bill does not guarantee to pay down the national debt.

     Every senator in this chamber believes we will enact additional tax
   relief, and provide for our nation's most pressing needs over the next
                                   decade.

     The additional untold story of this legislation is that the cost of
    this tax plan will quadruple in the next following decade. Unless you
    believe we're simply going to take back the tax cuts we're promising
    today, you're talking about a price tag exceeding $4 trillion in the
    decade from 2012 to 2022 - when the baby boomers will all be retired.

       Is that how we're going to provide for prescription drugs under
                   Medicare and shore up Social Security?

     By raiding their trust funds?

       Is that how we're going to protect our environment, improve our
                nation's schools and strengthen our military?

     By giving them fewer resources, instead of more, in the years to
     come?

   And is that how we're going to keep our economy growing and prospering?

     By returning to deficit spending, ever-increasing national debt, and
     costly interest payments on that debt?

     That's the road we're headed down, Mr. President. I've been down it
   before, and I'm convinced it's the wrong road. I'm choosing instead to
            take the conservative road of fiscal responsibility.

     I strongly support responsible tax cuts of nearly $1 trillion that
   would give Americans the relief they deserve. I voted for such cuts as
       some of us tried to amend both this bill and the earlier budget
   resolution. Specifically, I support tax cuts that meet four criteria -
       tax cuts that (1) do not raid Social Security; (2) do not raid
     Medicare; (3) provide relief from the marriage tax penalty now, not
                 later; and (4) pay down the national debt.

   Instead we are left with a tax package that is fiscally irresponsible.

   We are about to vote on a tax bill that largely promises future relief
   based on future surpluses that may not materialize. It poses a serious
    threat to our economy because it will use up what surplus there is so
    we cannot pay down the national debt. And it seriously threatens our
       Medicare and Social Security trust funds - not only in 2012 but
                            beginning next year.

    I promised the people of Florida I would do everything in my power to
     protect those trust funds and to continue paying down the national
     debt. I promised I would fight for a prescription drug benefit, and
   that I would work for better schools, a clean environment and a strong
   defense. I intend to keep those promises, and I must vote against this
                                    bill.
