        The Mission of the Soil Physics and Pesticide  Research Unit:

     * Develop methods for evaluating,  predicting, and managing the
       movement of water, salts  and agricultural chemicals in the root
       and vadose zones of salt-affected soils
     * Develop tools for assessing new
       soil-water-crop  management schemes to make effective use of
       limited  resources where salinity and/or  pesticides are a concern.

     * Evaluating the impact of  irrigated agriculture on soil and
       groundwater quality using integrated  unsaturated water flow and
       solute transport models and associated computer software
     * Pesticide volatilization and pesticide loadings from  agricultural
       fields to surface and ground waters
     * Developing improved methods for measuring unsaturated  water and
       solute transport parameters and related soil properties and
       developing informational  databases
     * Developing numerical models  for evaluating one- and
       multi-dimensional water flow and solute transport  in agricultural
       soils
     * Characterizing the important physical and chemical  processes
       affecting the fate and transport of harmful Pathogens,
       Pesticides and related  organic chemicals such as Methyl Bromide
       into the atmosphere and the subsurface
     * Quantifying the  effects of preferential flow and spatial
       variability on chemical  transport
