                                USGS Mission


   Earth Science Resources.

   The footer image. USGS serves the Nation by providing reliable
   scientific information to
     * Describe and understand the Earth.
     * Minimize loss of life and property from natural disasters.
     * Manage water, biological, energy, and mineral resources.
     * Enhance and protect our quality of life.

   The mission is accomplished through data collection, research,
   comprehensive studies, and information services in the broad
   disciplines of hydrology, geology, biology, geography, and cartography.

   The National Mapping Program of the USGS provides geographic and
   cartographic data, information, and related research to meet the broad
   requirements of the resource managers and Earth scientists in solving
   national challenges such as disaster response and mitigation, land and
   resource development, pollution abatement, transportation planning,
   urban development, and recreational use.

                             USGS Maps and Data

   The USGS continues to provide the leadership to develop and maintain
   the national standard for map production. The footer image. Western
   Geographic Science Center (WGSC) located in Menlo Park, CA is part of
   the National Mapping Discipline within the USGS. The WGSC strives to:
    1. Provide Earth science data and maps.
    2. Make data accessible to worldwide users.
    3. Help the public understand and use our data.

   The USGS is making available a number of its digital geographic data
   products to aid in the study, management, and enjoyment of the Lake
   Tahoe Basin.
     * Bathymetry -- A map of underwater terrain.
     * Digital Elevation Model (DEM) - Digital records of terrain
       elevations for ground positions at 10- and 30-m intervals.
     * Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle (DOQ) - A photographic map created
       from aerial photos corrected for distortion.
     * Digital Line Graph (DLG) - Vector GIS layers extracted from USGS
       7.5-minute topographic quadrangles. DLGs can contain a wide variety
       of information: hydrography, boundaries, roads, utility lines, etc.
     * Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) - Scanned USGS 7.5-minute topographic
       quadrangles.
