   California Energy Commission
   DATABASES
   The California Energy Commission offers these on-line databases and raw
   data sources.


   [Energy Commission Database] BUGS 1 - Database of Public Back-Up
   Generators (BUGS) in California
   (On line August 15, 2001)
   Microsoft Excel file listing of all public back-up generators in
       California greater than 300 kW. (1.8 megabytes. PLEASE NOTE FILE
       SIZE! YOU MAY NEED TO INCREASE MEMORY ALLOCATION IN EXCEL!)
       This database was assembled largely from information received from
       all the air districts in California except the Bay Area AQMD, with
       supplemental information supplied by the California Department of
       Corrections, the Office of Energy Assessments of the California
       Department of General Services, PG&E, Silicon Valley Power, and a
       major telecommunications company operating in the state. The user
       of this inventory needs to be aware of several features and
       assumptions made in assembling elements of the database, as well as
       several known limitations.
       Data on BUGs in the Bay Area AQMD is limited to that supplied by
       PG&E, Silicon Valley Power, and the major telecommunications
       company. The inventory most certainly does not include all BUGs in
       BAAQMD.

   [Energy Commission Database] BUGS 2 - Database of Portable Back-Up
   Generators (BUGS) in California
   (On line August 15, 2001)
   Microsoft Excel file listing of all portable back-up generators in
       California greater than 300 kW. (233 kilobytes)

   [Energy Commission Database] DEER -- Database for Energy Efficient
   Resources
   Windows-based Computer Program for PC-compatible computers. Database
       for Energy Efficient Resources (DEER) contains extensive
       information on selected energy-efficient technologies and measures.
       The DEER provides estimates of the average cost, market saturation,
       and energy-savings potential for these technologies in residential
       and nonresidential applications. The database contains information
       on baseline or typical measures -- those commonly installed in the
       marketplace -- and data on the costs and benefits of more
       energy-efficient measures. Energy-efficient measures provide the
       same energy services using less energy, but they usually cost
       slightly more. Baseline measures provide a comparison case against
       which to estimate the incremental costs and energy impacts of
       installing these more energy-efficient measures. Specific data for
       each technology include size, efficiency, energy savings,
       saturation by climate area and by utility area, and useful life.

   [Energy Commission Database] Listing of California Power Plants
   This is a 414 kilobyte Microsoft Excel 97-98 file that you can download
       and open in your computer using a database or spreadsheet program.
       The database lists all power plants in California one-tenth (0.1)
       megawatt or larger by name, county where located, owner, operator,
       and other information. Information has been updated and is current
       as of JANUARY 17, 2001.
       For a listing of power plants under construction or under license
       review, please go to: http://www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/
       The spreadsheet can be sorted using your software to list plants by
       resource type, size, city/county, etc.
       When downloading, your browser may display the file on screen as a
       text file with "strange-looking" characters. This is normal if you
       don't have your computer set up to handle FTP downloads or the
       Excel "mime" type. Using the pull-down file menu, save the file as
       a text file and open it from your spreadsheet or database program.
       Multiple years of this files are also available:
          + 1998 Database of California Power Plants
          + 1999 Database of California Power Plants
          + 2000 Database of California Power Plants
          + 2001 Database of California Power Plants

   [Energy Commission Database] Database of Electricity Substations in
   California
   This is a Microsoft Excel 4.0 file that you can download and open in
       your computer using a database or spreadsheet program. The database
       lists the 2,300+ electricity substations in California by name,
       county where located, owner, and the Energy Commission Transmission
       Line Map the substation is shown on. For a copy, please contact the
       Commission Cartography Office (916) 654-3902.

   Companies

   NOTE: The database is updated for 2001. A printed copy of the 2001
       updated directory can be downloaded Adobe Acrobat PDF. The 2001
       directory should be available on line in early 2002 as the database
