   ABOUT THE LIBRARY

   Established in 1879 to build and organize a collection of scientific
   materials in the earth sciences, the U.S. Geological Survey Library is
   now one of the largest libraries of its kind in the world.

   The original collection was based on exchange partnerships with
   domestic and international scientific organizations. Today the library
   holds over one million books and journals, 450,000 maps, 370,000
   microforms, 270,000 pamphlets, 250,000 black-and-white photographs,
   50,000 color transparencies, 15,000 field record notebooks, and 250
   videocassettes. Materials include USGS publications as well as those
   produced by state and foreign geological surveys, scientific societies,
   museums, academic institutions, and government scientific agencies. The
   libraries in Reston and Menlo Park are designated as official
   depositories for selected U.S. Government publications.

   In developing the collection the library staff has attempted to provide
   comprehensive coverage of the geological sciences and related
   interdisciplinary subjects. Among the areas covered are:

   Biology
   Cartography
   Earthquakes and seismology
   Ecology
   Environment
   Geochemistry
   Geology
   Groundwater
   Hydrology
   Mineral industries
   Mineral resources
   Mineralogy
   Mining production
   Oil and gas resources
   Paleontology
   Physical geography
   Solid-earth geophysics
   Surface water
   Volcanology

   Recent organizational changes in the Department of Interior have added
   new subject areas to the USGS Library. In January 1996 many of the
   holdings of the former Bureau of Mines libraries in Washington, D.C.,
   and Denver, Colorado, were added to the Reston and Denver collections
   respectively. In October 1996 the former National Biological Service
   became the Biological Resources Division (BRD) of the USGS. As a result
   of this change, the USGS Library has begun collecting materials in the
   biological sciences. In-depth coverage of these subject areas continues
   to be the responsibility of the BRD libraries located at 9 research
   centers around the country.

   The library collection is organized according to a specialized
   classification scheme developed in 1904 in consultation with the New
   York Public Library. At that time a suitable classification system did
   not exist for an earth science library with concentration in geologic
   topics. Classification is based on geographic areas, which are
   identified by numbers enclosed in parenthesis, and subject groupings
   for general works, earth sciences, and pure sciences, represented by
   whole and decimal numbers. A revised edition of U.S. Geological Survey
   Bulletin 2010 contains a complete description of the classification
   system.

   ACCESS TO THE LIBRARY

   The USGS Library is open to the public Monday through Friday, except
   Federal holidays. Visitors may use library materials on the premises or
   request items on interlibrary loan through their local library (i.e.
   public, school, university, or corporate library). Copy machines are
   available at all locations.  An online union catalog, containing
   bibliographic information about materials added to the library since
   1975, is available on the World Wide Web.

   RESEARCH AND REFERENCE ASSISTANCE

   In each library, reference librarians are available to assist with
   research; to check holdings for specific items; to explain services,
   policies, and the arrangement of library materials; and to help
   individuals use research tools, including the online catalog, the card
   catalog, CD-ROM products, other electronic databases, and printed
   reference sources.  To ask for reference assistance online, use the Ask
   a Librarian button on the library's home page.

   BORROWING MATERIALS

   Circulation staff in each library provide information on lending
   policies; check the availability of specific items; charge out
   materials; renew borrowed items; and resolve problems concerning lost
   or damaged materials. Circulation information is provided both in
   person and over the telephone.

   The USGS Library lends certain materials to the public and other
   libraries through interlibrary loan.  Please contact your local library
   (i.e. public, school, university, or corporate library) for assistance.

   Requests may be submitted through the OCLC electronic ILL system or on
   the standard American Library Association (ALA) form sent by mail or
   FAX.  The library will not process requests communicated by telephone.
   Pre-approval is required before an individual may pick up an
   interlibrary loan item in person.

   The loan period for ILL is four weeks, with one renewal. Copies up to
   10 pages may be supplied in response to an interlibrary loan request in
   lieu of lending the item. Loans are free of charge. Items that may NOT
   be charged out on interlibrary loan include:
   USGS Open-file Reports
       Journals
       Microforms
       Videocassettes
       CD-ROM Products
       Rare Books
       Reference Materials
       Fragile or Oversize Items

   Each library provides coin-operated self-service copiers to the public
   at 10 cents per page.
