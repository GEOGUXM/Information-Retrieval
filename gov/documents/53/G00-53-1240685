   1. Purpose. This chapter outlines policy with respect to the operation
   of non-Federal equipment (controls and devices such as position-locks
   and lights for wind tees, runway lights, rotating beacons, UNICOM
   Radio, etc.) at airports by Weather Bureau personnel.

   2. Background. Some airport offices are cooperating with state, county,
   city, or local organizations (airport managers, fixed base operators,
   etc.) by operating or monitoring non-Federal equipment at the airport.
   Requests for such assistance often develop because the Weather Bureau
   office is the only one open 24 hours per day.

   3. Policy. All current agreements may be continued. However, when
   changes are proposed or new requests are received, authorization will
   only be granted where:

           a. responsibility for operation will not interfere with or
   detract from Weather Bureau functions.

           b. it will render a valuable service that would otherwise not
   be possible.

           c. the controlling agency is agreeable to terms:

                   (1) that Weather Bureau assistance will be of secondary
   responsibility to Federal Government functions.

                   (2) that the Weather Bureau or the Federal Government
   will assume no liability.

                   (3) that the agency which owns the equipment will
   provide training in its operation, and will provide reimbursement for
   necessary licenses or other expenses that may be incurred.

                   (4) that the agency which owns the equipment will
   provide all logistical and maintenance support required for its upkeep,
   and will in no way expect or request assistance from Federal Government
   technicians.

   4. Obtaining Authorization. Authorization will be issued by regional
   headquarters. Consideration for such authority will be given upon
   receipt of a written request initiated by the controlling agency and a
   determination that the request is in line with the policy above.

   Prior to authorization, recommendations will be solicited from the
   local MIC with regard to provisions (a) and (b) of section 3. Upon
   favorable consideration by the regional headquarters, a written
   agreement will be forwarded to the controlling agency through the local
   Weather Bureau office. Such written agreement, duly signed by the
   parties and documented with the supporting correspondence, will
   constitute authority for the Weather Bureau to provide the service.
