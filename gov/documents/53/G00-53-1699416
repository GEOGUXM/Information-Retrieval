   TREASURY, IRS ANNOUNCE RELIEF FOR VICTIMS OF ATTACKS

   WASHINGTON The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service
   today announced initial administrative tax relief for individual and
   business taxpayers who are unable to meet their federal tax obligations
   because they were affected by Tuesday's terrorist attacks.

   The IRS and Treasury are providing relief to all taxpayers regardless
   of where they reside who are directly affected by the terrorist
   attacks.  For example, this includes relief workers, the victims on the
   airplanes, taxpayers whose place of employment is in a disaster area,
   and taxpayers with records maintained in a disaster area.

   In addition, the agencies are providing relief to all taxpayers in the
   five boroughs of New York City declared disaster areas by the
   President.  They are also providing relief to taxpayers located in
   Arlington County, Virginia, home of the Pentagon, which was declared a
   disaster area today.

   In the aftermath of Tuesday's tragedy, the IRS and Treasury want to
   assure taxpayers, businesses and tax practitioners that they are
   working aggressively to monitor the situation and resolve other
   potential tax administration issues as they are identified.

   Affected taxpayers who have an original filing deadline between
   September 11, 2001, and November 30, 2001, have an additional six
   months plus 120 days of time to file that return and make any payment
   due with that return.  Taxpayers who are currently on an extension that
   expires between September 11, 2001, and November 30, 2001, will have an
   additional 120 days to file that return.

   Affected individual taxpayers who face an estimated tax payment date on
   September 17, 2001 may postpone that payment by including the amount
   with their final estimated payments for Tax Year 2001, which are due on
   January 15, 2002.

   Affected corporate taxpayers who face an estimated tax payment after
   September 10, 2001, and before January 15, 2002, may postpone that
   payment until Jan. 15, 2002.

   In addition, for six months the IRS will suspend many enforcement
   activities such as levies, seizures and summonses -- for affected
   taxpayers.

   Taxpayers who are entitled to the relief described above should add the
   following designation in red ink at the top of returns they file:
   "September 11, 2001-Terrorist Attack."   If they receive a notice from
   the IRS, they should contact the IRS as indicated on the notice to
   explain why they are entitled to relief.

   Although the IRS cannot extend the deadline for employment or excise
   tax deposits, the IRS will provide relief for businesses unable to make
   these deposits because of the terrorist attacks.  The IRS will waive
   penalties on tax deposits required to be made by these businesses
   between September 11, 2001, and October 31, 2001, if those deposits are
   made by November 15, 2001.

   The IRS will provide additional details on this relief in Notice
   2001-61.

   Due to the unprecedented scope and breadth of this tragedy, the
   agencies will continue to monitor the situation and may issue
   additional guidance as appropriate.

   The entire Treasury family extends its prayers and sympathies to the
   families, friends, government workers and others affected by this
   attack.

   IRS CREATES DISASTER RELIEF TOLL-FREE NUMBER

   WASHINGTON The Internal Revenue Service announced today the
   establishment of a special toll-free telephone number for taxpayers
   whose ability to meet their federal tax obligations has been affected
   by the September 11 terrorist attacks. People with tax issues related
   to the attacks can call 1-866-562-5227.

   "This special number will help people cut through the red tape and get
   their tax questions answered quickly," IRS Commissioner Charles O.
   Rossotti said. "We don't want lingering tax questions to burden anyone
   during this challenging time."

   Beginning today, taxpayers can call the number Monday through Friday
   during the following local times:
     * In English, 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.
     * In Spanish, 8 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.

   Because of the unusual nature of the tragic events of September 11, it
   is impossible for the IRS to know every circumstance affecting
   taxpayers. The IRS encourages taxpayers whose ability to meet their
   obligations was affected by the terrorist attacks to call
   1-866-562-5227.

   "We wanted to provide specialized assistance to the people directly
   impacted by these tragic events," said Ron Watson, Director, Customer
   Account Services for the IRS Wage and Investment Division.

   The IRS has reached out to help taxpayers during this time.  For more
   information on tax extensions and other tax issues visit www.irs.gov.

   Taxpayers with questions not related to the terrorist attacks should
   visit the IRS web site or call the regular IRS toll-free number at
   1-800-829-1040.
