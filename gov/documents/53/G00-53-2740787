Shipping Papers

   Q. Are shippers and carriers required to keep copies of shipping papers
   for each hazardous materials shipment?

   A. Yes. On August 26, 1994, the Hazardous Materials Transportation
   Authorization Act of1994 amended the Federal hazardous materials
   transportation law to require shippers and carriersto retain shipping
   papers for a period of one year [49 U.S.C. § 5110(e)]. Because the
   lawis self-executing, shipping papers are required to be retained by
   shippers and carriers for a period of one year, effective August 26,
   1994. RSPA has initiated rulemaking to place this statutory mandate
   into the Hazardous Materials Regulations. We expect to issue a notice
   of proposed rulemaking in the near future.

Classification

   Q. Can hazardous material carried by a sales person qualify for a
   material of trade exception in § 173.6? Can a small quantity generator
   of hazardous waste use the material of trade exception?

   A. In order to take advantage of the material of trade exception,
   criteria in the definition for material of trade in § 171.8 must be
   met. Material of trade means a hazardous material, other than a
   hazardous waste, that is carried on a motor vehicle for the purpose of:
   (1) protecting the health and safety of the motor vehicle operator or
   passengers; (2) for the purpose of supporting the operation or
   maintenance of motor vehicle; or (3) by a private motor carrier in
   direct support of a principal business that is other than
   transportation by motor vehicle. A sales person's primary
   responsibility is not transportation; therefore, a hazardous material
   being carried by the sales person may qualify for the materials of
   trade exception if all the requirements of § 173.6 are met. With regard
   to hazardous wastes, a small quantity generator is excepted from the
   manifest requirements of 40 CFR Part 262; therefore, a hazardous
   material carried by a small quantity generator would not meet the
   definition for hazardous waste (see § 171.8). Accordingly, waste
   material from a small quantity generator may qualify for the material
   of trade exception if all requirements of § 173.6 are met.

   Q. Can an aqueous solution of alcohol containing 5.91% by weight of
   isopropyl alcohol and 0.15% formaldehyde having a flash point of 92ºF
   be reclassed as a combustible liquid as providedin § 173.150(e)?

   A. As provided in § 173.150(e), an aqueous solution of alcohol may be
   reclassed as combustible liquid if it contains 24% or less alcohol by
   volume and does not contain any other hazardous material. Formaldehyde,
   in concentration of 0.15% does not meet a definition of a hazardous
   material. The alcohol solution in question may be reclassed as a
   combustible liquid under this section of the HMR.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Q. What is an appropriate shipping description for a liquid that is a
   hazardous waste, but does not meet the definition of a hazardous
   substance or any other hazard class?

   A. Two appropriate shipping descriptions are available. The first,
   "Hazardous waste , liquid, n.o.s., NA3082, III", is preceded by the
   letter "D" in column 1 of the § 172.101 Hazardous Materials Table. The
   "D" indicates that the description is appropriate for domestic
   transportation but may be inappropriate for international
   transportation under the provisions of international regulations (e.g.,
   the ICAO Technical Instructions or the IMDG Code). The second, "Waste,
   environmentally hazardous substance, liquid, n.o.s., UN3082", is
   suitable for domestic or international transportation.

Packaging & Containers

   Q. Does a UN 4G fiberboard box require recertification or disposal if
   over two years have passed since its marked date of manufacture?

   A. No, periodic retest requirements apply to the manufacture of a
   design type, not to empty or filled packagings which are in use, or are
   in inventory awaiting use. Once manufactured in conformance with the
   marked standard (e.g., UN 4G), the packaging is suitable for use as
   long as it continues to conform to that standard.

                               Horizontal Line

Exceptions

   Q. Are used sharps and other medical waste that have been autoclaved
   considered medical waste?

   A. No. Medical waste materials that have been treated by steam
   sterilization, incineration, chemical disinfection or other effective
   means to eliminate the hazard are not considered regulated medical
   waste.

                               Horizontal Line

Marking

Q. Do identification numbers have to be displayed when non-bulk packages of two
or more different hazardous materials in quantities of 4,000 kg (8,820 lbs.) or
more with different proper shipping names and identification numbers are loaded
on a vehicle at one facility?

A. Under Docket HM-206 (effective October 1, 1998), a provision was added to the
general marking requirements in § 172.301 for large quantities of hazardous
materials in non-bulk packagings on a transport vehicle or freight container.
The identification number marking display applies only when 4000 kg (8,820
pounds) or more of hazardous materials in non-bulk packagings are loaded at one
loading facility only if all the hazardous materials in the transport vehicle or
freight container have the same proper shipping name and identification number.

     * ID# Required
          + $ 4000 kg (8,820 pounds) of HAZMAT at one loading facility;
            and
          + (2) Consists of only one hazardous material with the same
            proper shipping name and identification number.
     * ID# NOT Required
          + <4000 kg (8,820 pounds); or
          + Not all the same hazardous material on vehicle
     __________________________________________________________________

   Q. Are there exceptions to the poisonous by inhalation marking
   requirement of § 172.313?

   A. Yes. Under Docket HM-206, an exception was provided in § 172.313(a)
   from marking the words Inhalation Hazard on a package containing a
   material poisonous by inhalation, provided the words appear on the new
   POISON INHALATION HAZARD (PIH) label and placard. Although voluntary
   compliance is authorized, mandatory compliance for use of the new PIH
   label and placard, respectively, is October 1, 1999 and October 1,
   2001.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Q. Is an identification number marking required on a transport vehicle
   or freight container containing non-bulk packagings of materials
   poisonous by inhalation?

   A. When a transport vehicle or freight container is loaded at one
   loading facility with more than 1,000 kg (2,205 pounds) of non-bulk
   packagings containing a material poisonous by inhalation in Hazard
   Zones A and B having the same proper shipping name and identification
   number, the identification number for that material is required to be
   displayed on the transport vehicle or freight container, as prescribed
   in § 172.313(c).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Q. What are the new requirements for marking transport vehicles and
   freight containers containing lading which has been fumigated?

   A. Under HM-206, in §§ 172.302 and 173.9, a new FUMIGANT marking
   requirement has been adopted which is consistent with international
   standards and is applicable to every material used in the fumigation
   process. The new FUMIGANT marking requirement applies to all modes of
   transportation and not just to rail transport as previously required. A
   fumigated transport vehicle or freight container is a package for
   application of the fumigation requirements, unless it has been
   sufficiently aerated.

                               Horizontal Line

Placards

   Q. Are slogans or signs, such as Drive Safely, which are often
   displayed on placards and in placard holders, prohibited on a transport
   vehicle and freight container?

   A. Yes. Any slogan, sign, or other device that by its color, design,
   shape or content, could be confused with any placard is prohibited. The
   restrictions under § 172.502(a)(2) do not apply until October 1, 2001
   to a safety sign or slogan which waspermanently marked on a transport
   vehicle, bulk packaging, or freight container on or before August 21,
   1997.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Q. What placards must be displayed on a motor vehicle containing 7,000
   pounds of "Tetrachloroethylene, 6.1, UN1897, III"? Does the placard
   substitution table in § 171.14(a)(2) have any effect on placarding this
   shipment?

   A. Under Table 2 of § 172.504(e), KEEP AWAY FROM FOOD placards are
   required. Under the exception in § 172.504(f)(10), for domestic
   transportation POISON placards may be substituted for the KEEP AWAY
   FROM FOOD placards. The HM-181 transitional provisions in §
   171.14(a)(2) do not apply in this situation. The entry "none required"
   in the column titled "Old (Sept. 30, 1991) placard name" means that,
   under the HMR in effect prior to the HM-181 final rules, there was no
   equivalent placard. Therefore, no substitution is permitted and, as of
   October 1, 1994, the KEEP AWAY FROM FOOD placard must be used to comply
   with placarding requirements.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Q. What placards must be displayed on a motor vehicle containing the
   following materials loaded at one facility: 5,000 pounds of "Chromic
   fluoride, solution, 8, UN 1757, II" and 700 pounds of "Isopropanol, 3,
   UN 1219, II"?

   A. Even though the 700 pounds of Class 3 material is below the 1,001
   pound placarding exception limit, both materials must be placarded. The
   following placards are required for these two materials aboard a motor
   vehicle: A CORROSIVE placard is required to cover the 5,000 pounds of
   the Class 8 material and either a FLAMMABLE or a DANGEROUS placard to
   cover the 700 pounds of the Class 3 material.

Training

   Q. May a hazmat employer/employee train and test themselves (e.g.,
   owner-operator)?

   A. Yes, self-training is acceptable provided that all training
   requirements of § 172.704 are met.

   Q. Who certifies that an instructor is qualified to train, test, and
   certify in accordance with § 172.704?

   A. Except for certain FAA required CFR 14 training, the U.S. DOT does
   not review or certify training programs for pre-approval purposes. The
   employer must determine a trainer's qualifications based on their need.

   Q. Does the trainer who teaches and tests the hazmat employee, certify
   that the hazmat employee is trained/tested?

   A. No, the hazmat employer must certify that the employee has been
   trained and tested.

   Q. If an outside source trains but does not test the employee, must the
   employee be tested and certified based on this training?

   A. Yes. It is the responsibility of the hazmat employer to meet these
   training requirements. However, a hazmat employer may designate an
   outside source to train, test, and certify on its behalf.

   Q. Must the test be in a written format or may a skill demonstration be
   used?

   A. Any test that ensures that the employee can perform the assigned
   duties in compliance with the HMR is acceptable. Training and testing
   may be accomplished in a variety of ways: performance, written, verbal,
   or a combination of these.

   Q. Must the employee "pass" a test?

   A. The requirements do not state that the employee must "pass" a test;
   however, an employee may only be certified in areas in which he/she can
   successfully perform their hazmat duties.

   Q. Does IMDG Code, ICAO Technical Instructions, OSHA or EPA training
   fulfill the HMR requirements?

   A. This training may be used to the extent that the general awareness,
   function specific, and safety training and testing requirements of the
   HMR are met. Areas not covered will require additional training.

   Q. Who will enforce the training requirements in § 172.704?

   A. Enforcement pertaining to carriers is the responsibility of each
   modal administration. Compliance or non-compliance with the training
   rule will be determined during safety and compliance reviews of
   shippers and carriers.

   Q. What type of fines would be involved?

   A. Violations of any hazardous materials regulations including training
   may be subject to a civil penalty of up to $27,500 for each violation
   and, in appropriate cases, a criminal penalty of up to $500,000 and/or
   imprisonment of up to 5 years. (See 49 CFR § 107.329 and § 107.333.)

   Q. An office secretary types the required hazardous materials
   description on a shipping paper at the direction of another, item by
   item. Is the secretary a hazmat employee requiring training?

   A. Yes, each person who performs any function subject to the HMR must
   be trained, except special circumstances addressed by 172.704(c).

   Q. Do the training regulations apply to foreign flag vessels carrying
   hazardous materials?

   A. Yes, the regulations apply to each domestic and foreign vessel when
   in dry dock or in navigable waters of the United States.

   Q. Do the training regulations apply to a hazmat employers and/or
   employees who operate a bulk vessel transporting hazardous materials?

   A. No. Except for transportation in bulk packagings, the bulk carriage
   of hazardous materials by water is governed by 46 CFR Chapter I. See 49
   CFR § 176.5(d).

   Q. Is a shipmaster a hazmat employer?

   A. No, the shipmaster is a hazmat employee; the operator of the vessel
   is the hazmat employer.

   Q. Do the regulations apply to employees working with materials that
   are consumer commodities?

   A. Yes.

   Q. Does a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) with HM/tank vehicle
   endorsement satisfy requirements?

   A. A hazmat employer must determine applicability of CDL to the
   specific functions the employee performs and provide training for
   functions not covered by the endorsement.
