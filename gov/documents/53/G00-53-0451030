                             U.S. Courts of Appeals

   The intermediate appellate courts in the federal judicial system are
   the courts of appeals. Twelve of these courts have jurisdiction over
   cases from certain geographic areas. The Court of Appeals for the
   Federal Circuit has national jurisdiction over specific types of cases.

   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the 12 regional
   courts of appeals are often referred to as circuit courts. That is
   because early in the nation's history, the judges of the first courts
   of appeals visited each of the courts in one region in a particular
   sequence, traveling by horseback and riding " circuit." These courts of
   appeals review matters from the district courts of their geographical
   regions, and sometimes from certain federal administrative agencies and
   other sources.

   The First through Eleventh Circuits each include three or more states,
   as illustrated by a map The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
   Columbia Circuit hears cases arising from the U.S District Court for
   the District of Columbia and has appellate jurisdiction assigned by
   Congress in legislation concerning many departments of the federal
   government.

    Judges of the Courts of Appeals

   As in the district courts, the judges who sit on the courts of appeals
   are appointed for life by the President with the advice and consent of
   the Senate. Each court of appeals consists of six or more judges,
   depending on the caseload of the courts. The judge who has served on
   the court the longest and who is under 65 years of age is designated as
   the chief judge, and performs administrative duties in addition to
   hearing cases. The chief judge serves for a maximum term of seven
   years. There are 167 authorized judgeships on the 12 regional courts of
   appeals.
