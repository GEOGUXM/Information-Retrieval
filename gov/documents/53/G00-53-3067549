   New low- and zero-emission technologies are the key to achieving clean
   air in our region. Fully 45% of the needed emission reductions outlined
   in the 1997 Air Quality Management Plan rely on the development of new
   technologies. The South Coast AQMD, in fact, was the first to suggest
   requiring electric vehicles, clean fuels and cars, low-NOx boilers and
   residential water heaters, zero-polluting paints, and yes, even
   less-polluting barbecue lighter fluids. Industry, to its credit, has
   responded by producing these clean air products.

   AQMD takes seriously its responsibility to assist industry by funding
   the research and development of these new technologies. The agency does
   this through its Technology Advancement Office, in partnership with the
   Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee (MSRC).

           Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee

   MSRC is an independent agency, operating with AQMD support, that
   administers a discretionary program to fund projects to reduce
   emissions from mobile sources, such as motor vehicles. (link to MSRC

                Clean Air Sovent (CAS) Certification Program

   Solvents containing little or no Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are
   being used more and more due to a variety of reasons. Some AQMD rules
   require the use of such low-polluting products in future. To assist the
   public, AQMD has set up a program to certify a new class of solvents
   called Clean Air Solvents (CAS) that are environmentally benign and
   meet AQMD rules. Manufacturers, suppliers, and users can apply for
   certification as CAS, if the solvent meets the qualifications defined
   in AQMD rules. This, however, is not a performance guarantee or product
   endorsement and there are other options available to comply with AQMD's
   solvent rules and regulations.

                     Best Available Control Technologies

   AQMD requires industries seeking permits to use Best Available Control
   Technologies (BACT). These BACT requirements are regularly updated as
   new technologies come into use.
