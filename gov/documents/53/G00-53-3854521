   Situation Planning and Response

      Want to be sure that the right people will have the right information
   to guide decisions during an emergency?

   [femis.jpg]
   Pacific Northwest National Laboratory develops integrated decision
   support architectures and software tools that enable multiple users to
   work together effectively when rapid responses are necessary. We know
   that determining actions, communicating them, tracking them, and
   executing them among multiple groups of users can be critical in
   emergencies, decision-making and planning efforts.

   We combine technologies such as regional databases, geographic
   information systems, electronic planning and multi-user interactions to
   provide user-oriented interfaces to help make decisions and track the
   resulting actions. Our tools
     * combine real-world and modeling information required during
       decision-making processes
     * orchestrate actions among several parties in different locations
     * create planning scenarios for geographically separated parties to
       use in developing, reviewing and exercising decisions before
       they're actually implemented.
