                         Active Galaxies and Quasars

    For "normal" galaxies, we can think of the total energy they emit as
   the sum of the emission from each of the stars found in the galaxy. For
     the "active" galaxies, this is not true. There is a great deal more
   emitted energy than there should be... and this excess energy is found
    in the infrared, radio, UV, and X-ray regions of the electromagnetic
    spectrum. The energy emitted by an active galaxy (or AGN) is anything
   but "normal".So what is happening in these galaxies to produce such an
                              energetic output?

       There are several types of active galaxies: Seyferts, quasars,
    blazars,... and probably still more to be discovered. Most scientists
    believe that, even though these types look very different to us, they
   are really all the same thing viewed from different directions! Quasars
    are active galaxies which are all very, very, very far away from us.
     Some of the quasars we have seen so far are 15 billion light-years
     away! Blazars are very bright in the radio band, which is what you
   would expect if were looking directly down a jet. On the other hand, if
      the jet is not pointing toward you at all, and the dusty disk of
       material is in the way, you would see just what we see from the
      Seyferts. Seyferts are probably much closer to us than quasars or
                                  blazars.

    Active galaxies are intensely studied at all wavelengths. Since they
    can change their behavior on short timescales, it is useful to study
    them simultaneously at all energies. X-ray and gamma-ray observations
     have proven to be important parts of this multiwavelength approach
   since many high-energy quasars emit a large fraction of their power at
    such energies. X-rays can penetrate outward from very near the center
     of a galaxy. Since that is where the "engines" of AGN are located,
      X-rays provide scientists with unique insights into the physical
    processes occurring there. In addition, gamma-ray observations alone
   can provide valuable information on the nature of particle acceleration
     in the quasar jet, and clues as to how the particles interact with
                             their surroundings.

                              Seyfert Galaxies

   Of the two types of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) which emit gamma-rays,
   Seyfert galaxies are the low-energy gamma sources. Active galaxies are
    galaxies which have a small core of emission embedded in an otherwise
      typical galaxy. This core may be highly variable and very bright
    compared to the rest of the galaxy. Models of AGN concentrate on the
    possibility of a supermassive black hole which develops at the center
       of the galaxy. The dense central galaxy provides material which
   accretes onto the black hole releasing a large amount of gravitational
   energy. Part of the energy in this hot plasma is emitted as gamma-rays.

   Seyfert galaxies typically emit gamma-rays up to energies of about 100
    keV and then fade at higher energies. Early gamma-ray observations of
       Seyfert galaxies indicated that photons were detected up to MeV
      energies, but more sensitive observations have cast doubt on this
   possibility. At these low gamma-ray energies, the emission is usually a
      smooth continuation of the X-ray emission from such objects. This
   generally indicates that the physical processes creating the gamma-rays
    are thermal processes similar to those responsible for emission from
     galactic black hole sources. As a result, gamma-ray studies of the
     high-energy spectrum and variability can give scientists important
           information about the physical environment in the AGN.

    Observations of Seyfert galaxies in gamma-rays are also important for
   studies of the cosmic gamma-ray background. Even in regions of the sky
   where there are no point sources, a faint gamma-ray glow is detectable.
   It may be that this glow is the sum of many faint galaxies or perhaps a
     more exotic process. Studies of individual Seyfert galaxies can be
      combined with a model of how such objects are distributed in the
    Universe to compare to the diffuse gamma-ray background. In this way,
     astronomers not only learn about the interesting AGN phenomena, but
       learn more about the general nature of the Universe as a whole.

                                   Quasars

     One of the most remarkable trends in gamma-ray astronomy in recent
     years has been the emergence of high-energy gamma-ray quasars as an
   important component of the gamma-ray sky. At gamma-ray energies, these
    active galaxies are bright; they are highly variable at all energies.
    Unlike the Seyfert type AGN, most of these sources are preferentially
   detected at high energies, usually 100 MeV or more. In fact, they have
   been detected above 1 GeV, and some up to several TeV! Given the large
      distances to these objects and the strong emission of high-energy
    gamma-rays, these are the most powerful particle accelerators in the
        Universe. Over 50 high-energy quasars are known at this time.

   Many astronomers believe that Seyfert galaxies and high-energy quasars
   are basically the same type of objects, but we are simply viewing them
      differently. Radio observations of AGN often show powerful jets,
   streams of particles coming from the central source -- like water from
   a spigot. Charged particles are accelerated to relativistic energies in
   these jets. In the unified view of active galaxies, high-energy quasars
   are being viewed with the jet pointed towards us which allows us to see
      the resulting energetic radiation. With Seyfert galaxies, we are
     viewing from the side and do not see the very high-energy radiation
                      which is traveling down the jet.

   The region of the sky containing one of the high-energy quasars, PKS
   0528+134, is shown at two different times with the EGRET instrument.
   These active galaxies are highly variable, strongly emitting gamma-rays
   sometimes, disappearing at other times.

                                   Blazars

     Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are thought to be galaxies with super
     massive black holes at their center and relativistic particle jets
      emitted from the central region. The black holes are believed to
    contain a million to a billion solar masses. AGN's have been observed
   to emit radio-waves (~10^-6 eV), visible light (1-10 eV), x-rays (~10^4
    eV), and gamma-rays from MeV (10^6 eV) energies. A few AGNs have been
     observed to emit at TeV (10^12 eV) energies. The AGN's observed at
    higher energies form a subclass of AGNs known as blazars; a blazar is
    believed to be an AGN which has one of its relativistic jets pointed
   toward the Earth so that what we observe is primarily emission from the
   jet region. The visible and gamma-ray emission from blazars is variable
    on timescales from minutes to days. Although theories exist as to the
   causes of this variability, the sparse data do not yet allow any of the
                             ideas to be tested.

   To date more than 60 blazars have been detected by the EGRET experiment
    aboard the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory. All these objects appear to
   emit most of their bolometric luminosity at gamma-ray energies and, in
              addition, are strong extragalactic radio sources.
