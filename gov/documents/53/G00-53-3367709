  Development of a 14-digit hydrologic unit code numbering system for South
  Carolina

   A Hydrologic Unit Map showing the cataloging units, watersheds, and
   subwatersheds of South Carolina has been developed by the U.S.
   Geological Survey in cooperation with the South Carolina Department of
   Health and Environmental Control, funded through a U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency 319 Grant, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
   Natural Resources Conservation Service. These delineations represent
   8-, 11-, and 14-digit Hydrologic Unit Codes, respectively. This map
   presents information on drainage, hydrography, and hydrologic
   boundaries of the water-resources regions, subregions, accounting
   units, cataloging units, watersheds, and subwatersheds.

   Of the 1,022 subwatersheds delineated for this project, 1,004 range in
   size from 3,000 to 40,000 acres (4.69 to 62.5 square miles). Seventeen
   subwatersheds are smaller than 3,000 acres and one subwatershed,
   located on St. Helena Island, is larger than 40,000 acres. The total
   drainage area for each of the 1,022 subwatersheds is given in table 1
   (.pdf file of Sheet 1) of the report.

   The source maps for the basin delineations are 1:24,000-scale
   7.5-minute series topographic maps and the base maps shown on figure 1
   (.pdf file of Sheet 2) are from 1:100,000-scale Digital Line Graphs;
   however, the data are published at a scale of 1:500,000. In addition to
   the two PDF files of map sheets 1 and 2 from the report, a GIS dataset
   of the hydrologic unit map in Arc/Info Export format also is available
   for downloading (holding the Shift key down, left-click on the mouse to
   save the file to your local disk) (Arc/Info export file of 14-digit HUC
   map). The codes used to attribute the polygons and lines in the
   Arc/Info coverage are explained in the metadata (metadata text file for
   14-digit export file).

   The hydrologic unit map and its associated codes provide a standardized
   base for use by water-resource managers and planners in locating,
   storing, retrieving, and exchanging hydrologic data. In addition, the
   map can be used for cataloging water-data acquisition activities,
   geographically organizing hydrologic data, and planning and describing
   water-use and related land-use activities.
