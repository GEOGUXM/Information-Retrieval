   Coastal Areas
   [dotclear.gif]

   In coastal areas, waters from several sources mix to become the essence
   of beautiful and unique water bodies, full of diversity. Maintaining
   biological diversity (the existence of many different types of plants
   and animals) is a key part of maintaining the health of the earth's
   ecological systems and its future resources. Coastal ecosystems are
   critical habitats, nurturing many species of plants and animals. South
   Florida's coastal systems support spiny lobster, penaeid shrimp, blue
   crab, oyster, spotted sea trout, stone crab and many other species of
   marine and freshwater species of commercial and recreational interest.
   The nature of coastal ecosystems, vulnerable to human activity,
   presents some unique sustainability challenges as these areas are
   especially prone to habitat loss and alteration.

   Coastal ecosystems associated with south Florida watersheds include the
   southern reaches of the Indian River Lagoon, the Savannas, the Atlantic
   Ridge, the St. Lucie River and Estuary, the Loxahatchee River and
   Estuary, the West Jupiter Wetlands, the Lake Worth Lagoon, Biscayne
   Bay, Florida Bay, the Florida Keys, Cape Sable, Cape Romano, the
   Caloosahatchee River and Esturary, Estero Bay, San Carlos Bay and
   Charlotte Harbor.

   One of the South Florida Water Management District's goals is to manage
   freshwater discharge to south Florida's estuaries in a way that
   preserves, protects and where possible, restores essential estuarine
   resources. The District seeks to ensure that estuaries receive not only
   the right amount of water at the right time but also clean, quality
   water.
