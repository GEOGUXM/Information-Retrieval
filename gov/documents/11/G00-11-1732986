                                    OOPS!

     Not the word you want to hear when you start operating a system on
     the ground or on orbit. It's a short word that can represent a wide
     range of possible damage, injury, and loss. However, between the 'O'
     and the 'S' there is an 'OP' which stands for opportunity. Before a
     system is built, designers have the opportunity to assess the
     hazards associated with their hardware, the propellants being used,
     the use environment, or whatever other factors are pertinent. Once
     the hazards are known, a system can be designed that you and others
     can "LIVE" with.
     At the White Sands Test Facility, hazards assessment is a large part
     of what we do for NASA, the Department of Defense, aerospace and
     other areas of industry. What OOPS are you trying to avoid?
