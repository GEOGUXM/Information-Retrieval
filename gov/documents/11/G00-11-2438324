             Scalable Fault Tolerance for Distributed Computing

                                 Description

       As the size and complexity of tera-scale distributed computing
   platforms continue to grow, so does the probability that a failure will
    occur during the execution of a long-running simulation. Applications
      running on these systems are not currently equipped to deal with
   failures efficiently, nor is there vendor support for fault tolerance.
      Thus, when a failure occurs, the application crashes. While many
      programmers make use of checkpoints to allow for restarting their
      applications, this is cumbersome and incurs substantial overhead,
     especially as the number of processors and the size of the problem
                                become large.

       In order to explore new methods for scalable fault tolerance in
       large-scale distributed applications, Sandia's Computer Science
   Research Institute (CSRI) sponsored a workshop on fault tolerance, held
     at the California site. The workshop featured a series of technical
       presentations by leading researchers in the field and by Sandia
       scientists, as well as numerous discussions on new and exciting
                            research directions.
