          A user-oriented package for modelling stellar atmospheres
                  and for stellar spectroscopic diagnostics

   The present set of computer programs is a package designed to
   accomplish a wide range of stellar spectroscopic diagnostics. In its
   maximum configuration, the user may start from scratch and calculate a
   model atmosphere of a chosen degree of complexity, and end with a
   synthetic spectrum in a wavelength region of interest for an arbitrary
   stellar rotation and an arbitrary instrumental profile.
