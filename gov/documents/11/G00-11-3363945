             Published on 1/25/2002 in the Burlington Free Press
          Music helped sustain Middlebury scholar in Chinese prison
                                by Erin Kelly

      WASHINGTON -- The Tibetan music that landed Ngawang Choephel in a
      Chinese prison for more than six years is also what sustained him
      through his ordeal, the former Middlebury College scholar and his
                        ex-classmates said Thursday.

    Choephel sang songs in prison and was serenaded by his fellow Tibetan
                                 prisoners.

   "I am grateful to all the Tibetans who shared their folk music with me
   in Tibet during my two months' travel and even after my imprisonment,"
    said Choephel, speaking briefly in the office of Rep. Bernie Sanders,
                                    I-Vt.

     Choephel was released by the Chinese government Sunday -- one month
   before President Bush is scheduled to visit the country. The U.S. State
   Department, the Vermont congressional delegation and Vermont residents
    have been campaigning for his release since he was taken into custody
    in 1995, charged with espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.

   His real crime, in the eyes of the Chinese, was that he was videotaping
    Tibetan musical performances to make a documentary to show the Dalai
    Lama, the exiled leader of Tibet. Tibet is under Chinese control, and
                China has sought to wipe out Tibetan culture.

    "I think it's a testament to his courage of spirit that he can't wait
     to get back to his music and his instruments," said David Barlow, a
    1995 graduate of Middlebury College, who, with his cousin Jon Barlow,
                  became friends with Choephel in Vermont.

       Choephel thanked all the Americans who pushed for his release,
   especially Vermonters, who raised $10,000 to pay for his mother's trip
   from India to visit him in prison. That fund is being used to help pay
   for Choephel to undergo medical tests at Georgetown Hospital and George
                       Washington University Hospital.

    Choephel was officially freed on a "medical release" after suffering
                     respiratory problems and hepatitis.

   The music scholar knew Vermonters and other Americans were pushing for
   his release because he was sometimes able to listen to Voice of America
      radio and get information from Tibetans imprisoned after him, his
                                friends said.

   Choephel spent a year at Middlebury College as a Fulbright Scholar and
                  lived in Burlington for about six months.

    "I would like to say thank you to the people in Vermont, and I'd like
     to get back to Vermont as soon as possible to have a wonderful time
    with the people and to share my music and sing some songs," he said.

    First, Choephel is eager to visit his mother, Sonam Dekyi, in India.

    "My three primary concerns at the moment are my health, my mother and
   my fellow Tibetan prisoners," Choephel said in a written statement. "So
   far, I am encouraged by my test results. As soon as I can I will travel
     to India to be with my mother and the rest of my family. I plan to
                return to the United States at a later date."

   Choephel, a slight man who looks older than his 34 years, did not want
   to discuss details of his imprisonment because he fears for the safety
    of the remaining Tibetan prisoners. He spent much of the past 6 years
     in a prison in Tibet and was moved to a prison in China during his
                                 final year.

   "I sincerely hope that my release is the first of many more to come in
                         the near future," he said.

   Choephel's friends said they are amazed by his strength of spirit. They
                    said he is even laughing and joking.

      "Just to see that beautiful wide smile again is wonderful," David
    Barlow said. "This guy just has a heart of gold. He's just a gentle,
                                gentle soul."

   The one difference, Choephel's friends said, is that there is a sadness
                     about him that wasn't there before.

   "He's really sad about the suffering his mom went through," Jon Barlow
   said. "He felt responsible for causing her grief. He was always worried
                    more about her than he was himself."

      Although the official reason for Choephel's release was medical,
       Sanders said he thinks the political pressure finally paid off.

    "I think ultimately the Chinese government decided you weren't worth
   the trouble with all the people pressing them to release you," Sanders
              told Choephel after greeting him with a bear hug.
