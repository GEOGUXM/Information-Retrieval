                   NASA Inventions and Contributions Board
                                  (Code RI)

     Saturn V five lightsource raytracing The 14-member Inventions and
     Contributions Board (ICB, est. 1958) is a major contributor in
     rewarding outstanding scientific or technical contributions
     sponsored, adopted, supported, or used by NASA which are significant
     to its mission. The charter of the ICB is specified in the Space Act
     of 1958, which is the legislation under which NASA was created as an
     agency. The Board is chaired by the NASA Chief Engineer, and its
     members selected for minimum three year terms by the NASA
     Administrator. The composition of the Board reflects NASA's finest
     technical talent whose expertise covers more than 40 fields of
     science and technology.

     Over the past 43 years, the ICB has issued over 77,000 awards to
     NASA and its contractor employees, as well as to other government,
     university, and industry personnel. The value of the awards that has
     been paid out exceeds $26 million (2001 dollars). The Space Act
     limits the amount of an award for any single contribution to no more
     than $100,000 without notifying Congress. Innovators may apply for a
     Space Act Award by submitting NASA Form 1329, which must be
     submitted to an Awards Liaison Officer (ALO) at the sponsoring NASA
     Center.

     The NASA General Counsel selects the NASA Invention of the Year
     Award, which is supported by the ICB with technical assistance,
     publicity, and monetary awards. The NASA Chief Information Officer
     co-sponsors with the Office of the Chief Engineer and the ICB the
     selection of the NASA Software of the Year Award. Information about
     this event, including the special entry form, is available at this
     site.  Past NASA Software of the Year winners are referenced from
     here.

     From 1991 through 2001, the ICB granted 98 awards for exceptional
     scientific and technical contributions to NASA's mission, which are
     archived here.

     The ICB automatically rewards contributors whose (1) innovations
     have been reported in NASA Tech Briefs ($350 per author), (2)
     software has been approved for release by NASA to qualified users
     ($1,000 for a sole author, $500 each for multiple authors), or (3)
     inventions have received approval for patent application by NASA
     under the Space Act ($1,000 for a sole inventor, $500 each for
     multiple inventors).

     The ICB also acts as the approval body for grants of waiver to
     NASA's rights in contractor inventions. Changes in the law in 1984
     automatically grants waiver for small businesses, certain
     not-for-profit companies, and universities. NASA, as a title agency,
     is vested with all rights to large contractor's inventions unless
     this waiver is granted by the ICB. The key contact in the process
     for an application for patent waiver, and for advance patent
     waivers, is Ms. Gail M. Sawyer, ICB Staff Specialist.

     Operations at the ICB are governed by three sections of the United
     States Code of Federal Regulations:  14CFR1209, 14CFR1240, and
     14CFR1245.  A description of the ICB and features of our programs
     are provided at this link.
