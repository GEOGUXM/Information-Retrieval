     The MSFC Shuttle Team
     Dedicated To Excellence

     This web site is about Space Shuttle propulsion hardware and
     technology. But what makes the technology work is the people
     involved. The shuttle team is made up of government employees, our
     contractors, and the hundreds of companies all over America that
     produce the components that make up the space shuttle propulsion
     systems and get the shuttle ready for its next flight. The shuttle's
     success depends on the talent and dedication of each and every one
     of our people.
