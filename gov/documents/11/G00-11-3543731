   3-D Modeling
   by the San Francisco Bay Region Project
   [bars640x5.gif%20]

   Three-dimensional information, compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey
   San Francisco Bay Region Project, enhances our abilities to:

    1. Characterize ground shaking resulting from earthquakes
    2. Model plate tectonic movement
    3. Estimate undiscovered resources
    4. Analyze aquifer systems and model groundwater movement
    5. Predict the dispersion of contaminants

   The 3-D program used by the San Francisco Bay Region Project is
   earthVision¨. Data entered into the program may include Digital
   Elevation Models (DEM's) of terrain, ARC/INFO coverages of geology, and
   text files of scattered data points such as well locations. All data
   are precislely located and can be queried, sliced, diced and rotated in
   an infinite number of ways.

   The images at right were created with earthVision¨.

   The upper image shows a transect across northern California, from the
   Santa Cruz Mountains (on the right) to the Great Valley (on the left).
   The 3-D map space is 175 km long, 100 km wide and 110 km deep. This
   image shows the Salinian terrane in pink, other crustal rocks in green,
   the Moho in red, the lithosphere in purple and the aesthenosphere in
   gray. The crustal and lithoshperic rock are truncated by the Calaveras,
   San Andreas, and San Gregorio faults. The yellow dots are earthquake
   hypocenters.

   The lower image is a single frame from a model of a small toxic plume
   that leaked into an aquifer in Morgan Hill, California. The bright
   bands of color represent different levels of contamination within the
   aquifer.

   These two images demonstrate the dynamic range inherent with this
   modeling program.
