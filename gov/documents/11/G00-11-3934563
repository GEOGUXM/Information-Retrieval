   Welcome to the AWIPS Public Weather Dissemination System. It is a java
   applet/application that displays AWIPS weather information in a highly
   graphical, multi-windowed, multi-modal display that includes images,
   graphics, text and sound. It will be continually upgraded which might
   add new capabilities and/or change the look of the GUI. Please look at
   the What's New link to check out changes to the system.
