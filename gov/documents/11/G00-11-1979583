                      NELSON GETS PLEDGE FROM POWELL TO
                    LOOK AT 'WELFARE' OF HOLOCAUST OFFICE

     Washington, D.C. - At the urging of Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, Colin
     Powell, President-elect Bush's choice for secretary of state, said
      today he'll "immediately look at the welfare" of the government's
     office for aiding Holocaust victims if confirmed to head the State
                                 Department.

                            enter ID number 1453

   Powell's remarks are the first publicly by any Cabinet designee of the
   incoming Bush administration on how it will handle the issue of whether
   to continue the State Department's Holocaust office. His comments came
   in response to Nelson's opening statement during the retired four-star
     general's confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations
                                 Committee.

       Before his election to the Senate in November, Nelson served as
   Florida's treasurer and insurance commissioner in a job that pitted him
   against international insurance companies due to his aggressive efforts
           to recover what is owed to survivors of Nazi brutality.

        "We dragged them kicking and screaming to set up a Holocaust
     commission," Nelson said of his and the efforts of an international
       task force to recover from big insurers unpaid World War II-era
    policies. "And there was a lot more than just insurance still owed to
                                  victims."

     In fact, jewelry, art and other property plundered by Nazi Germany
      weren't returned to Holocaust victims, a presidential commission
   reported this week. The report was part of an unprecedented half-decade
   campaign to re-examine what happened in the Holocaust, and recalculate
                          what's owed to survivors.

     As secretary of state, Powell would inherit the State Department's
    Holocaust office that oversees programs negotiated over the last few
   years but not yet paying money that was pledged. Powell told Nelson and
       the other members of the Foreign Relations Committee during his
    confirmation hearing that he realizes the importance of the Holocaust
                                   office.

       "I will look at the welfare of that office immediately," Powell
                                  pledged.
