   CAM

   Instrument mentor notified Site Ops that the CO2 system was not
   generating any data since 12/1.  Status check found an error message on
   the screen indicating Com Port 1 could not be opened.  Rebooted the
   computer at 1721 GMT.  RTS status O.K. at 1723 GMT.

   Instrument mentor notified Site Ops that the CO2 system was not

   indicating Com Port 1 could not be opened.  Rebooted the computer at
   1851 GMT.  RTS status O.K. at 1853 GMT.

   Mentor reports that the 60m Flux has not been working properly since D4
   program was installed and requests that the following steps be
   performed on the 60m Flux computer. 1.) Move raw and processed data to
   e:\Data and 2.) Disable D4 time protocol program. Technician moved all
   the raw data files in the collection directory (raw (M*)to the larger
   NTFS partition (e:\data\). Technician then disabled the D4 clock
   program. Computer rebooted and RTS at 2100 GMT.

   CM/TG

   The CO2 flux time was 9 minutes and 26 seconds ahead of SDS time.
   Installed D4 program on the CO2 computer and configured it to sync the
   clock to SDS every 15 minutes.  Updated the time at 1835 GMT.  RTS
   status O.K. at 1840 GMT.

   10/24/01

   CAM

   Instrument mentor informed Site Ops that no data was being collected
   from the CO2 Flux system for the past couple of days and requested that
   the computer be rebooted.   The program was running and the system
   appeared normal.  Stopped the program and rebooted the computer as
   requested at 1743 GMT.   When the program restarted there was an error
   opening Com Port 1.  Rebooted again at 1745 GMT and this time no errors
   were encountered.  RTS at 1747 GMT.    Mentor later found that the
   system had recovered prior to the reboot.

   7/3/01

   CAM

   Instrument mentor notified Site Ops that the CO2 Flux system had not
   collected any files since Friday, 6/29.  T/S found that the Gillsonic
   was minimized which causes it to freeze.  Maximized Gillsonic program
   and RTS status O.K. at 1312 GMT.  Suspect that the computer was
   inadvertently power cycled during maintenance to the PGS system on 6/29
   and the program never started.

   5/23/01

   MR

   The instrument mentor wants the 60 meter instruments power cycled.
   Power cycled the instruments at 1455. RTS at 1510.

   Mentor

   The CO2 flux computer has been relocated to the new building at the
   base of the 60M tower. The new building was installed to house the
   Precision Gas Sampling (PGS) equipment.

   3/21/01

   CAM

   Instrument mentor asked if the CO2 Flux computer could be configured to
   automatically restart after a power failure to minimize data loss.
   Stopped the CO2 Flux program at 1800 GMT. Entered the BIOS setup
   utility and enabled the AC Power Loss Restart option. Restarted the
   computer and program and then disconnected the AC power for 5 seconds
   to test the restart. Applied AC power and the computer powered itself
   on as desired. However, the Logon prompt came up and the CO2 Flux
   program would not start until the proper username and password were
   entered to log on. RTS the system at 1810 GMT to research auto logon
   capabilities. Found that the registry could be modified to perform an
   auto logon. Stopped the program at 2015 GMT and made the necessary
   registry changes. Tested the system several times and found that the
   computer will now automatically restart and log on. RTS at 2058 GMT.

   CAM

   Marc Fischer notified Site Ops that he had not received files from the
   instrument since 2/24. T/S found that the C02 Flux computer was powered
   off. The site experienced a 1 hour power outage on 2/24 which had
   drained the UPS batteries and caused the computer to power off.
   Restored computer power at 2029 GMT. RTS status O.K.

   2/7/01

   CM

   Marc Fischer notified Site Ops that he was not receiving data from the
   instrument. T/S found that the PC was powered off. The site experienced
   some problems with one leg of AC power on 2/5. This caused some
   problems with some of the smaller UPS's and the UPS probably shut the
   computer down then. Powered the computer on and RTS at 1922 GMT.

   11/17/00

   KT

   At 1937 GMT powered off computer to install 360 UPS. At 1941 GMT
   plugged instrument computer into UPS and left monitor plugged into
   surge protector. At 1942 GMT powered computer on. Status ok. RTS at
   1952 GMT.

   11/16/00

   TG

   Instrument mentor reported that the flux system stopped collecting data
   at 1930 GMT on 11/14. T/S found the computer was not logged on to.
   Logged on and the flux program started working. Apparently, the system
   had a power bump the day before that caused the computer to reboot. An
   operator must log into the system for the software to work properly.

   11/13/00

   TG

   Set the CO2 Flux clock to CST time. The computer was previously set to
   PST.

   11/9/00

   CW

   Rebooted CO2 Flux computer following tower maintenance.

   9/20/00

   TG

   Mentor reported that the computer was locked up. T/S indicates that
   root drive was filled with data files. Technician created a data
   directory and copied all data files into the new directory. Rebooted
   computer and RTS status ok.
