   Welcome to the home page of the Simulation Research Group at Lawrence
   Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley, California. We
   specialize in creating building energy simulation software. To find out
   more about our work, please click on our name or make a selection from

   Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, located in the East Bay hills,
   faces San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The little "finger" of
   land on the left is Treasure Island, built for the 1933 Panama-Pacific
   Exposition and later used by the U.S. Navy. The tiny island in the
   middle is Alcatraz (once a federal prison and now a national park). The
   big island on the right is Angel Island (once a point of entry for
   immigrants and now also a national park). In the distance behind
   Alcatraz Island is the Golden Gate Bridge, off to the left is the city
   of San Francisco and to the right is Marin County. Click here for a
   (QuickTime VR) scene of San Francisco Bay.

   [labnight2.jpg] This spectacular sunset shot was taken from the lab
   looking toward the Golden Gate (aren't we lucky to have a view like
   this?).

   To the right is an aerial view of LBNL, looking toward the east. In the
   lower right quadrant of the picture is part of the University of
   California campus. At the top of the picture is Mt. Diablo (3500 ft.),
   30 miles away.

   University of California at Berkeley.
