   Resource Ecology and Fisheries Management Division

   The Alaska Fisheries Science Center's Resource Ecology and Fisheries
   Management (REFM) Division conducts research and data collection to
   support management of Northeast Pacific and eastern Bering Sea fish and
   crab resources. Twenty-five groundfish and crab stock assessments are
   developed annually and used by the Pacific and North Pacific Fishery
   Management Councils to set catch quotas. Division scientists also
   evaluate how fish stocks and user groups might be affected by fishery
   management actions.

   The REFM Division is responsible for implementing the U.S. Fisheries
   Observer Program, which requires placement of observers on vessels and
   at processing plants. Observers collect catch data, take biological
   samples, make marine mammal observations, and record quantities of
   marine debris encountered. Biological samples are used by the
   Division's Age and Growth staff to construct age-length keys and
   critical growth parameters.

   REFM scientists use biological and oceanographic information coupled
   with numerical simulation techniques to study the interaction of fish
   populations, fisheries, and the environment. Information on the
   relationship between predators and prey developed by the Division's
   Resource Ecology and Ecosystem Modeling staff is critical to this
   endeavor.

   The REFM Division also provides economic information to NMFS, industry
   and other agencies to assist with such projects as evaluating the
   economic effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound;
   developing guidelines for valuing commercial and recreational
   fisheries; and providing extracts for research projects.
