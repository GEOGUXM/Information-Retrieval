   DIAL is a WWW based data distribution system. It allows data providers
   to easily serve their Earth science data directly to their users. DIAL
   provides traditional catalog services like metadata search, while also
   providing extended interactive data services like browsing, subsetting,
   subsampling, reformatting and direct downloading. The power of DIAL has
   recently been enhanced by the addition of the EOSDIS "Version 0"
   protocol, which enables a project to set up a distributed system of
   DIAL servers.

   DIAL supports Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) and HDF for EOS (HDF-EOS)
   formatted datasets. DIAL also provides interoperability with GIS
   systems through traslators.

   DIAL software has been tested using Netscape 4.0.5, 4.0.6 and MS
   Internet Explorer 4.0 (It should work with later versions of the
   browsers.)

   Current version of DIAL is 3.0 (Release Notes).

   Data providers can choose any of the following different ways to
   distibute scientific data and provide data services:

   Direct Access
   This method is suitable for data providers to distribute a small number
   of static data files to data users. No catalog search is available in
   this approach.  Click this link to view an example HDF-EOS data file
   using the direct access method.

   Quick View (Transient Area)
   This method is suitable for data providers who are required to provide
   a quick view of data without a metadata catalog.  In this approach the
   catalog search will not be available.  This approach is best suited for
   Quality Assurance environment.
   This site has several quick look areas:
     * Example HDF and HDF-EOS data files
     * Hantavirus Risk Maps
     * START/SEADIS data files
     * IGRID Demo data files
     * TERRA data files

   Local Search
   In this method, DIAL can be used as a stand alone data server.  By
   using DIAL in this way, both DIAL search and data access capabilities
   are provided to the data users. If the data provider has a large number
   of data files to be distributed, this method is recommended.  Click
   this link to search our DIAL test site (Java enabled browser
   required).  Users with non-Java enabled browsers can use our simple
   HTML search interface.

   Distributed Search
   This method is appropriate for any project with multiple DIAL sites
   interested in providing a single user interface to search all the
   sites.  Individual DIAL sites can be integrated with the EOS Data
   Gateway system (formerly EOSDIS Version 0 IMS) forming a distributed
   data search and access system. Click this link to search our DIAL test
   site through our test gateway (a separate EOS Data Gateway installed
   for our testing purposes). Click this link to search ESIP Federation
   SWIL Testbed server.

   NOTE: For most standalone data distribution systems, Local Search
   provides the best balance of user features and provider
   responsibilities.

   DIAL Metadata Catalog
   DIAL can implement its inventory catalog as a flat file or as a
   JDBC-compatible database file.   Click this link to view the catalog
   structure of our test site.

   Acknowledgement
   The HDF file browser was developed by the HDF Group at NCSA. We have
   extended the browser with additional viewing and subsetting functions
   in close cooperation with the HDF Group. The original source code of
   the NCSA Science Data Browser is available from NCSA's SDB home page.
