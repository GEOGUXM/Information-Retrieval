                                                        SAGE II / ERBE Picture
     The SAGE II mission provides the scientific community with a long-term,
   global depiction of the distribution of aerosol, ozone, water vapor,
   and nitrogen dioxide. By this, it provides unique and crucial input to
   the understanding of global, seasonal to inter-annual variability in
   climate and, in particular, trends in stratospheric ozone.
