   What's New
   The Healthy School Meals Resource System (HSMRS) is a searchable web

   Nutrition Programs.


   Feature of the Month


             The Food Buying Guide for Child Nutrition Programs

   yield tables. The Meal Pattern Charts have been updated and a chart has
    been added summarizing required menu items for Nutrient Standard menu
