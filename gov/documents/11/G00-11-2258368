   Valeros Cogeneration Power Plant
     __________________________________________________________________

   Valeros Cogeneration Power Plant will be a nominal 102 megawatts (MW).
   The power plant will be operated at the Valero Refining Company
   (Valero) in Benicia, California which is in Solano County.  Valero has
   broken the project up into two phases and have submitted permit
   applications number 2488 and 2695 to obtain permits for the equipment
   in each phase. The equipment in the first phase will produce
   electricity for the Valero refinery which will virtually eliminate the
   need for local utility power. The equipment in the second phase will
   produce electricity that can be exported into the grid for use by other
   businesses and households in Northern California.
