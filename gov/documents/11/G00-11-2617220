     MARK YOUR CALENDAR: "The Truth About the Costs of ITS" Workshop at
     the TRB 2002 Annual Meeting
     __________________________________________________________________

   Since December of 1994, the United States Department of
   Transportation's Joint Program Office for Intelligent Transportation
   Systems has been actively collecting information regarding the impact
   of ITS projects on the operation of the surface transportation network.
   Data collected under this effort is available in the ITS benefits
   database. Several related reports are also available for viewing and
   downloading, including a one page desk reference that summarizes
   available data.
   The ITS Joint Program Office (JPO) also collects information on ITS
   costs, and maintains this information in the ITS unit costs database.
   The database is a central site for estimates of ITS costs data that the
   ITS JPO can use for policy analyses and benefit / cost analyses. In
   addition, the database can be viewed and downloaded as a costing tool
   for ITS implementers.
   The Data Needs section of this site contains information related to the
   effort to identify the areas of ITS application in greatest need of
   evaluation to assess their impact on the surface transportation system.
   Mitretek Systems Inc. maintains and analyzes the information collected
   for each of these efforts.
