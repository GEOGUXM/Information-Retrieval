   The Department of Developmental Services is responsible for designing
   and coordinating a wide array of services for California residents with
   developmental disabilities. These services are provided through a
   statewide system of 21 locally-based regional centers. Regional centers
   are nonprofit private corporations that have offices throughout
   California to provide a local resource to help find and access the many
   services available to individuals with developmental disabilities and
   their families. Both geographic accessibility and population density
   were considered when selecting locations for the 21 regional centers.
   The catchment area boundaries for the regional centers conform to
   county boundaries or groups of counties, except in Los Angeles County,
   which is divided into seven areas, each served by a regional center.
