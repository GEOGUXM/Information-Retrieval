      The Office of Women in Development (WID) was established in 1974 to
      help ensure that women participate fully and benefit equally from U.S.
      development assistance programs.

      Today the WID office assists the U.S. Agency for International
      Development (USAID) with integration of gender concerns into all USAID
      programs, coordinates with the donor community, and identifies emerging
      issues where gender is a key concern.


   The office has four strategic objectives:
                 1. Enhancing the economic status of women
         2. Expanding educational opportunities for girls and women
    3. Improving women's legal rights and increasing their participation
                               in civil society
       4. Integrating gender considerations throughout USAID programs

      In pursuing these objectives, the WID Office supports technical
      assistance and training for USAID Missions, promotes greater awareness
      of gender issues through publications and conferences, and funds
      studies of emerging issues.
