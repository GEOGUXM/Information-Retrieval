     size to one or two IC chips. Presently used radars transmit a short
     burst of several EM waves with a 2-GHz nominal frequency, and at a
     PRF of 2 MHz.

       Above Audio Signal: "The prowler wore a ski mask for disguise."

  Data Description

   The audio signal (top) is from an adult male speaking, "the prowler
   wore a ski mask for disguise." The EM sensor signal shows glottis open
   and closing for the voiced segments of the audio signal. Both signals
   are taken simultaneously. The audio is delayed relative to the glottal
   signal by about 52 samples (0.8 milliseconds) because of the difference
   in the speed of sound and light. For more descriptions, please refer to
   the reference section for talks and presentations.

   The data pictured above, skimask.zip, may be downloaded and examined
   within Matlab. The skimask mat-file includes the variables audio,
   emsensor and fs, where fs is the sampling rate. This file is a zipped
   Matlab file for a PC or UNIX version. If you wish to use a Macintosh
   version of skimask.mat, download the file to machine and load it within
   the Matlab application.

  Project Introduction

   Newly developed electromagnetic (EM) near field sensors (refer to the
   technology transfer web site) provide a capability for measuring EM
   wave reflections from speech organ interfaces in a non invasive, safe,
   fast, portable, and low cost fashion. These devices have similarities
   to some far-field radar systems except that their power levels are very
   low, their measurements are commonly in the near-field, and their rate
   of data acquisition (e.g., prf) is very high and very flexible. They
   are being used in investigations for other applications such as heart
   function and mechanical vibration sensing. In particular, they make
   possible the real-time measurements of the positions and motions of the
   human vocal articulators during speech production. The measurements to
   date include the motions of the glottis (i.e., vocal folds), lips,
   tongue, jaw, and velum. Examples of vocal fold measurements (in real
   time) gives the pitch period, enable noise removal, and enables pitch
   synchronous deconvolving of the corresponding excitation from the
   acoustic output to obtain improved quality speech transfer functions.
   Similarly, EM sensor measurements of jaw motion with acoustic speech
   provide constraints on the sound being articulated for speech
   recognition, and can be used for "talking head" and video image
   synchronization.

   In the past, there have been successes and limitations on using EM wave
   sensors, such as radars, in imaging modes. The difficulties include
   resolution, penetration, safety, speed, portability, complexity, and
   calibration. Our present approach using very fast, low power systems
   resolves many of these issues. The speech articulator signals from our
   instruments are being carefully calibrated using existing procedures,
   such as electroglottographs, laryngoscopes, magnetic resonance imaging,
   ultrasonics, and many others. Also, continuing issues associated with
   tomographic image formation are relieved by using these EM sensors for
   specific model-based organ parameter measurements. The experiments and
   interpretations in our reports are intended to demonstrate promising
   approaches to studying speech production from babies to adults, for
   diagnosing and correcting communication disorders and learning
   difficulties, for real time continuous speech recognition, speech
   synthesis, speaker verification, speech coding, noise reduction, and
   other applications.
