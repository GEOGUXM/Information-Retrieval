   Rayleigh Road


   Rayleigh Road is temporarily closed.  The main entrance to the site
   (27th Way) is the only entrance and exit available at this time.   This
   entrance is manned with a guard 24/7.  If you are expecting visitors to
   the site, you may want to advise them to have I.D. ready to present to
   the guard.  This will minimize delay for visitors and employees.
