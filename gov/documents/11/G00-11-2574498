   NASA partners with Federal and state government agencies, with U.S.
   businesses, and with universities through agreements where each partner
   provides resources such as money, facilities, or expertise, to achieve
   a common goal.  As a result of work being done at KSC, many patents are
   available for licensing.

   In addition, NASA's unique corrosion research facilities and expertise
   are available on a reimbursable basis as long as they do not duplicate
   resources in the private sector.  We would be happy to discuss details
   with you.   If you would like to contact us about materials research
   opportunities at NASA Kennedy Space Center, we would be happy to answer
   any questions you might have.  General information on "business
   partnerships at KSC" is also available.
