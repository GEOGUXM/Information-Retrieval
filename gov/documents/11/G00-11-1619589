   Background facts on meteors and meteor showers.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [38crop.JPG] Figure 1: Example of four bright Leonid meteors that were
   photographed in the constellations of Monoceros and Orion by Lorenzo
   Lovato of Italy on November 17, 1998.

   METEORS: Meteors are better known as "shooting stars": startling
   streaks of light that suddenly appear in the sky when a dust particle
   from outer space evaporates high in the Earth's atmosphere. We call the
   light phenomenon in the atmosphere a "meteor", while the dust particle
   is called a "meteoroid".
     * Size: Most visible Leonids are between 1 mm and 1 cm in diameter.
       For example, a Leonid meteor of magnitude +5, which is barely
       visible with the naked eye in a dark sky, is caused by a meteoroid
       of 0.5 mm in diameter and weights only 0.00006 gram.
     * Speed That tiny particle can cause a light so bright that it can be
       seen over distances of hundreds of kilometers. The reason is the
       astronomical speed of the meteoroids. Just before they enter the
       Earth's atmosphere, Leonid meteoroids travel at 71 kilometers per
       second, or some 2,663 times as fast as a fast pitch in baseball,
       or, if you want, around the Earth in 3.8 minutes!
     * Source of light When meteoroids enter the Earth's atmosphere, they
       collide with numerous air molecules. Those collisions sputter away
       the outer layers of the particle, creating a vapor of sodium, iron
       and magnesium atoms. In subsequent collisions, electrons are
       knocked into orbits at larger mean distances from the nucleus of
       the atoms. When the electrons fall back to their rest positions,
       light is emitted. This is the same process as in gas discharge
       lamps.
     * Colors of meteors The color of many Leonids is like the color of
       our sodium discharge lamps. For the same reason: meteoroids contain
       traces of sodium. The color of a meteor is an indication of its
       composition and the excitation temperature: sodium atoms give an
       orange-yellow light, iron atoms a yellow light, magnesium a
       blue-green light, calcium atoms may add a violet hue, while silicon
       atoms and molecules of atmospheric nitrogen give a red light.
     * Sounds Meteors do not normally cause audible sounds. Hence, they
       will pass by unnoticed if not seen. But watch out for hissing
       sounds that have been reported for very bright meteors. These
       sounds are thought to be due to very low frequency (VLF) radio
       waves interacting with the local environment. A sonic boom is
       sometimes heard for very bright Leonid meteors, called fireballs,
       that appear near your own observing site high in the sky. If the
       particle is larger than the mean free path of the air molecules, a
       high Mach number shock wave forms in front of the meteoroid. Very
       rarely, this shock wave penetrates deep enough in the atmosphere
       that it can be heard. It sounds like the sonic boom of an airplane,
       but as a distant rumble.

   [afterglow.jpg] Figure 2: The left image shows a bright afterglow in
   the path of a meteor while the meteor itself is seen to move onward.
   Video frame from the 04:00:29 UT fireball by Peter Jenniskens. The
   right image shows a persistent train high in the sky above an
   observatory dome minutes after the meteor itself has faded. The train
   enables telescopes to point at the path of a meteor. This train was
   photographed by the Uma team of the Observatori Astronomic de Mallorca,
   Spain.

   PERSISTENT EMISSIONS: Bright meteors leave persistent glows.
     * Wake is the brief glow behind the meteor head. The wake is caused
       mainly by the green light of neutral oxygen atoms. Wakes last 1-10
       seconds. Sometimes the term wake is also used to describe the area
       directly behind the meteor head.
     * Afterglow is the persistent metalic atom (Na, Fe,Mg) emission glow
       in the path of bright fireballs. The afterglow lasts a few seconds.
     * Persistent train is the long enduring emission that remains in the
       path of a bright fireball once the afterglow has faded. Persistent
       trains can last for 1-30 minutes (typically 4-6 minutes) at an
       apparent brightness of +4 to +5 magnitude. The optical light of
       these long enduring trains is from Na (sodium) and FeO (iron
       oxyde), from airglow-type chemistry of the recombination of oxygen
       atoms and ozone molecules that is catalised by sodium and iron
       atoms. Persistent trains last long enough to enable telescopic
       studies of the path of a meteor. Upper atmosphere winds distort the
       shape of the train.

   Figure 3: The orbit of comet 55P Tempel-Tuttle in a diagram by Yeomans
   et al. (1996). The planet positions are shown for February 28, 1998,
   when the comet passed the Sun most recently. The comet travels every
   33.3 years between the orbits of Earth and Uranus. Right shows an
   all-sky view of the Leonid outburst from Modra Observatory in a 4 hour
   exposure on November 17, 1998.

   [trail.jpg] Figure 4: A classical picture of a comet, showing the dust
   and gas tail. The dust trail in the comet orbit is indicated.

   METEOR SHOWER: Some days of the year show a larger number of meteors
   than usual that all have a common point of origin on the sky and
   originate from the same comet. The Leonids are such a meteor shower.
   METEOROID STREAM: is the cloud of dust particles in the path of a
   comet. When Earth encounters a meteoroid stream, the particles
   evaporate high in the atmosphere in a brilliant light, causing a meteor
   shower.
     * Radiant is the point in the sky from where all meteors seem to
       radiate. The radiant of the Leonids is in the constellation Leo.
       The radiant is a perspective effect. All particles move in about
       the same orbit (roughly that of the comet). An observer in the
       middle of the stream sees the meteors fall left and right, above
       and behind him. However, they all seem to come from a certain
       direction. That direction is the radiant.
     * Dust trail is what the astronomers call the young meteoroid stream.
       The dust trail is found spread out along the orbit of the comet (as
       illustrated in picture of comet to the left).
     * Dust tail of a comet is caused by dust particles small enough to
       scatter sunlight. Those are very small smoke-like particles (less
       than 0.1 mm in size) and are ejected from the dust coma by solar
       radiation forces.
     * Gas tail of a comet is what is left over from the evaporating ice.
       The gas molecules ionize and move along the magnetic field lines
       rapidly away from the comet, in opposite direction from the Sun
     * Dust trails and dust tails represent large and small dust
       particles, respectively. The large particles remain close to the
       comet and form a dust coma. However, small ejection velocities
       cause large differences in orbital period of these particles.
       Hence, in the next return the slow particles will lag and the fast
       particles will proceed the comet. The result is a trail like
       structure in the orbit of the comet. We see a meteor storm when the
       Earth crosses that trail of dust.
     * Meteor storm is seen when Earth crosses such dust trail.
       Officially, for a meteor storm rates have to increase to 1000 per
       hour, or 1 per second.
     * Annual shower is the name for a wider and more dispersed meteoroid
       stream after the major planets perturbed the dust away from the
       dust trails. Earth encounters this dust at about the same intensity
       every year. In most years, the Leonids are a rather insignificant
       annual meteor shower. Rates peak at 13 per hour on November 17. The
       main activity is between November 13 and 20, but rates are larger
       than 1 per hour in the period between October 31 and November 30
       (in good dark skies early in the morning).
     * Meteor outburst is the common name for meteor storms and lesser
       non-annual showers. Only when the Earth travels through relatively
       fresh cometary matter will rates go up significantly above the
       normal level of annual activity. Then, and only then, can we see a
       meteor outburst. The Leonid storms are such meteor outbursts. There
       were no Leonid outbursts reported between 1970 and 1993. The first
       Leonid outburst of a new series associated with the upcoming return
       of P/Tempel-Tuttle was seen in 1994.

   jets of water vapor and dust sprouting away.

   WHERE DO METEORS COME FROM: Meteoroid streams are caused by the debris
   of comets. The stuff of comets comes from interstellar space where the
   materials are assembled in the atmospheres of stars and in the dense
   molecular clouds of gas and dust between the stars. The comets are
   build of that material and were formed in the outer parts of the solar
   system, in regions beyond Saturn's orbit, at the time of the birth of
   our solar system.
     * How meteoroids leave the comet is a matter of research. When comets
       approach the Sun, the ices evaporate and the dust particles are
       ejected into orbit in geyser like fountains.
     * Comet nucleus is the mountain of ice and dust (mostly dust) that is
       at the center of a comet. This picture is the nucleus of comet
       1P/Halley. The nucleus of this comet was photographed by the Giotto
       Satellite in 1986. It has a 2-3 times larger nucleus than
       55P/Tempel-Tuttle.
     * Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle is the parent of the Leonid meteoroid
       stream. The orbit is shown in the graph above.
