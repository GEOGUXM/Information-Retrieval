           Description of the Lidar Applications Group Activities

                Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) Concept

                      Airborne DIAL Campaign Data Sets

              Listing of Lidar Applications Group Publications


  Airborne Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) Field Experiment Examples:

   Example Aerosol, Ozone, and Water Vapor Images

  Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry near the Equator - Atlantic (TRACE-A)

NOTE: Actual example of a collage of imagery showing biomass burning in Africa,
                                       as
  observed visually (by DC-8 Aircraft) and from space by AVHRR satellite, that
                       was investigated during TRACE-A. (
 Biomass Burning )


  Flight 13: Nadir data showing plume from biomass burning and low-level cloud
        and enhanced photochemically produced O3 across the troposphere.
                               (Aerosols; Ozone)

              Pacific Exploratory Mission - West B (PEM-West B)

           Flight 17: Zenith data showing stratospheric intrusion. (
Aerosols; Ozone)

      Lidar Atmospheric Sensing Experiment (LASE) Validation Experiment

Flight 10: Nadir data from high-altitude (ER-2) aircraft across eastern U.S. fro
                                       m
                          Georgia to West Virginia. (
Aerosols; Water Vapor)
