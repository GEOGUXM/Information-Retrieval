                   Financial Management Service Seal FACTS II

   Updated December 5, 2001

                                  Overview

   FACTS II (Federal Agencies' Centralized Trial-Balance System II) allows
   agencies to submit one set of accounting data (mostly budgetary, some
   proprietary) that fulfills the needs of the SF 133 Report on Budget
   Execution, the FMS 2108 Year-End Closing Statement, and much of the
   initial set of data that will appear in the prior year column of the
   Program and Financing (P&F) Schedule of the President's Budget.

   *This Qtr 4 window date is tentative. Official year-end closing dates
   are dependent on the release of the September Monthly Treasury
   Statement (MTS). Once the MTS is officially final, the date will be
   published in the TFM Year-end Closing Bulletin and will then be updated
   here.

   Note: During each quarter window, users may add supplementals to the
   previous quarter's submission. For example, during Quarter 2, a
   supplemental may be added to the Quarter 1 submission. The same applies
   to Quarters 3 and 4. For Quarter 1, however, a supplemental can not be
   added for the previous Quarter 4 submission. Instead, a revision period
   is typically granted by OMB in January for the previous quarter. In
   addition, for Quarters 1, 2, 3, and 4, agencies may add supplementals
   for their current quarter.
