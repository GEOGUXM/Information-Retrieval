   The USGS South Florida Ecosystem History Project, part of the USGS
   South Florida Ecosytem Program, is designed to integrate studies from a
   number of researchers compiling data from terrestrial, marine, and
   freshwater ecosystems within south Florida. The Project is divided into
   3 regions: Biscayne Bay & the Southeast coast, Florida Bay & the
   Southwest coast, and Terrestrial & Freshwater Ecosystems or Southern
   Florida. The purpose of these projects is to provide information about
   the ecosystem's recent history based upon analyses of paleontolgy,
   palynology, geochemisty, hydrology, and sedimentology of cores taken
   from south Florida region.

   go to Database
   The USGS South Florida Ecosystem History Online Database contains data
   regarding site locations, field information, water chemistry and
   salinity, vegetation information, and biotic occurrence tables for
   foraminifers, molluscs, ostracodes, pollen, dinoflagellates, and
   diatoms.

   go to Reference Data Guide
   [HPTime.jpg]
   If you are interested in attempting to access data that has been
   referenced within papers published by scientists working on the South
   Florida Ecosystem History Project, this information has been grouped
   together in an easily accessible format within the Referenced Data
   Guide area of the online database.

   go to OFR's
   USGS Open File Reports are publications which document the progress of
   current ongoing studies and include interpretation of the data that has
   been compiled. Open File Reports for all of the South Florida Ecosystem
   History Projects are available online in Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.0
   format.
   go to Salinity Maps
   Salinity Maps compare abundances of benthic foraminifers in modern
   sediment samples to modern salinity conditions in Florida Bay and
   Biscayne Bay.

   Our "Kid's Corner" featuring: a trivia game, animated characters, a
   simplified dictionary of terms used on this page, and a vast photo
   gallery. This part of the website is designed to assist young people in
   grasping the importance of working to preserve our environment and
   entertain them at the same time.

   Our new ONLINE POSTERS section gives you access to the posters that
   were presented at recent scientific meetings. Most of the posters are
   presented exactly as they were at the original meeting using Adobe
   Acrobat Reader 3.0 format, which allows you to zoom in on text and even
   closely examine the figures, graphs, and photos.
