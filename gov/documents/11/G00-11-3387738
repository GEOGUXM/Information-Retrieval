ACCESSIBLE TRANSPORTATION

   Transportation is a vital link to jobs, education, health care services
   and other essential daily destinations. For many, driving and owning a
   car is a second nature solution to meeting these needs. But for people
   who are unable to drive a car due to physical or mental disability
   getting from one place for another can be a life-altering challenge.
   Accessible transportation offers vehicles and facilities with barriers
   removed to allow their use by people with special transportation needs.

   Public Transit
   •  Transit
      Regular transit service is designed to provide access for many people
      with special transportation needs. Accessible transit services,
      sometimes called paratransit, are often available for those who can't
      access regular transit service. Contact your local transit agency for
      information about access to both paratransit and regular fixed-route
      transit services.
