   The Computer Science Branch (CSB) is part of the Lister Hill National
   Center for Biomedical Communications (LHNCBC) at the National Library
   of Medicine (NLM). The Branch applies techniques of computer science
   and information science to problems in the representation, retrieval
   and manipulation of biomedical knowledge. CSB projects involve both
   basic and applied research in such areas as intelligent gateway systems
   for simultaneous searching in multiple databases, intelligent agent
   technology, knowledge management, the merging of thesauri and
   controlled vocabularies, data mining, and machine-assisted indexing for
   information classification and retrieval. Research issues include
   knowledge representation, knowledge base structure, knowledge
   acquisition, and the human-machine interface for complex systems.
   Important components of the research include embedded intelligence
   systems that combine local reasoning with access to large-scale online
   databanks.

   Computer Science Branch research staff include the teams that developed
   NLM's Gateway, Internet Grateful Med and HSTAT (Health
   Services/Technology Assessment Text) programs and the team that
   annually produces the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
   Metathesaurus. Staff members participate actively in the medical
   informatics and information science research communities and
   professional specialty societies. They participate in the meetings of
   the Internet Engineering Task Force. Finally, recognizing the
   importance of addressing the future of medical informatics by helping
   to train new researchers, Branch Chief Dr. Lawrence Kingsland and
   computer scientist Ms. May Cheh codirect the eight-week NIH elective in
   Medical Informatics for third-year and fourth-year medical students
   each Spring.
