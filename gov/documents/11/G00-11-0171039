    Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program

      The National Institute of Standards and Technology, located just
      outside Washington DC, has a 12-week Summer Undergraduate Research
      Fellowship (SURF) program providing hands-on research experience in
      the Physics Laboratory, the Materials Science and Engineering
      Laboratory, and the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory.


    Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facilty

      The Electron and Optical Physics Division of the Physics Laboratory
      has operated the Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facilty (now
      SURF III) electron storage ring at the National Institute of
      Standards and Technology (NIST) for over 30 years.

      The SURF III magnetic field is being improved by a factor of 50,
      allowing irradiance calculations to be made with much higher
      accuracy than SURF II could achieve. SURF III will be able to store
      electrons at energies as high as 400 MeV, compared to 300 MeV for
      SURF II. The higher electron energy will extend the usable range of
      radiation from SURF to shorter wavelengths, enabling experiments in
      the "water window" from 2.3 nm to 4.4 nm.
