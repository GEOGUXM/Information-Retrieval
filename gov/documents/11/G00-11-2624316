   OLYMPIA - Gov. Gary Locke signed a measure on Jan. 22, that
   retroactively changes the deadline for submitting a final map of
   Washingtons congressional and legislative districts. The first law of
   the legislative session clears the way for the 2002 election boundaries
   to become effective on Feb. 12, the final date by which the Legislature
   can make minor amendments to the plan.

   This legislation is necessary to correct the problem that while
   Commission met its constitutional deadline of Jan. 1, it missed the
   statutory deadline, Locke said. What the commission did was a very
   good piece of work ...(it) complied with the spirit and the
   requirements of our state constitution, and so theres no reason to
   have this revised and reopened and completely redone.

   History
   Since 1790, the United States has taken an official headcount to help
   ensure a government by and for the people. Article I, Section 2 of the
   United States Constitution mandates this federal census every 10 years.

   Enter the 22nd Census.
   [sp.gif]
   In spring 2001, Washington received its Census 2000 data for redrawing
   legislative and congressional district boundaries. Today, we count
   every man, woman and child to guarantee that all people are fairly
   represented in the political process. The new census information
   indicates that the states official 2000 population is nearly 5.9
   million people  an increase of about 1 million residents in 10 years
   time. This official figure and all accompanying redistricting data,
   will be used by the Washington State Redistricting Commission to redraw
   the boundaries for each of the states 49 legislative and nine
   congressional districts.

   The Commission
   Until the early 1980s, Washington redistricted in the way of most
   states: by legislative action. For decades, the Legislature redrew
   political boundaries in an often highly contentious process. After
   nearly a century of legislative redistricting, including two
   redistricting efforts by initiative, Washington voters decided it was
   time for a new approach.
   [sp.gif]
   In 1983, the people passed a constitutional amendment giving the
   decennial responsibility of redrawing political boundaries to an
   independent, bipartisan commission. The states first commission,
   tasked with redrawing legislative and congressional districts, was
   formed in 1991. During an 18-month period, it completed its mission of
   drawing a new district map, and disbanded. In early 2001, a new
   commission was appointed. Majority and minority leaders in the
   Legislature selected two Republicans and two Democrats to serve as
   voting members. The four voting commissioners then selected a
   non-voting chairman. This bipartisan approach ensures that neither
   party obtains an unfair advantage in the way redistricting is
   accomplished.

   After a lengthy public comment period, the commissioners will deliver a
   new redistricting plan to the Legislature. This plan must be approved
   by at least three voting commissioners and is due by December 15, 2001.
   At that point, legislators may only make minor changes to the
   redistricting plan. What is more, proposed amendments must be approved
   by a two-thirds majority of both the House and the Senate, and must be
   passed within the first 30 days of the next legislative session.
   [sp.gif]
   The plan  amended or not  will then establish the new boundaries for
   the 2002 elections. Neither the Governor nor the Legislature can reject
   the commissions plan.

   While the commission has significant autonomy in developing a plan,
   they must follow established legal standards. The guiding principles
   for creating a redistricting plan include:

   [sp.gif]  each district shall have a population, excluding
   non-resident military personnel, as nearly equal as practicable to the
   population of any other district;
      district lines should be drawn to coincide with local political
   subdivisions (such as city and county lines) and communities of
   interest;
      districts should be convenient, contiguous (share a common land
   border or transportation route) compact;
      49 legislative and 9 congressional districts must be drawn based on
   state law and federal apportionment totals;
      plans should be drawn to provide fair and effective representation
   and encourage electoral competition;
      plans shall not be drawn to purposely favor or discriminate against
   any political party or group.
