   Apr. 17 New! : Meet Loki's big brother, Avalon

   Parallel Penguins

Loki is a Beowulf-class supercomputer built from commodity components.

  16  Pentium Pro Processors
x  5  Fast Ethernet interfaces
+  2  Gbytes RAM
+ 50  Gbytes Disk
+  2  Fast Ethernet switches
+     Linux
------------------------------
= 1.2 real Gflops for $63,000

(but that is the 1996 price)

   August 1997: Match our performance for $28k
