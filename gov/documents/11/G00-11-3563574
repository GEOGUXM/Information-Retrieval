   inflight spatial (Fig. 1) available in the U.S. today disorientation is

   accidents. Fur- thermore, it has been reported that up to 90% of the
   total number of general aviation accidents in- volving inflight spatial
   disorientation are fatal. The GYRO (Fig. 2) is a device that provides
   360 degree continuous yaw motion as well as + or - 15 degree pitch and
   30 degree roll which, in conjunc- tion with a computerized imaging
   system, results in a realistic simulation of flight. The GYRO pro-
   vides civil aviation pilots, aviation medical exam- iners, and FAA
   flight crews with the opportunity to experience vestibular and visual
   illusions (spa- tial disorientation) that occur during IFR conditions
   in an inherently safe environment. The programmed flight in the GYRO
   does not require an instructor - only an external safety observer. The
   pilot receives Figure 1. Altitude Chamber a 2-min orientation and then
   takes the controls. The 6-min. flight progresses from VFR, with
   "out-the- window" scenes on a CRT, to IFR conditions. CAMI has the only
   operational altitude chambers (training and research) in the U.S. that
   meet the current safety standards in the pressure vessel in- dustry to
   ensure the protection of occupants, op- erators, and maintenance staff.
   This requires that the design, fabrication, testing, and inspections of
   the chamber meet the following standards: 1) American Society of
   Mechanical Engineers, (ASME) ASME/ANSI, PVHO-1 "Safety Standards for
   Pressure Vessels for Human Occupancy", 2) ASME, "Boiler and Pressure
   Vessel Code". Sec- tion VIII, Division I, "Rules for Construction of
   Pressure Vessels", Section II, "Material Specifica- tions", and Section
   IX, "Welding and Brazing Qualifications", 3) National Fire Protection

   Fire Protection Association, (NFPA), 99B, Hypobaric Facilities. Figure

   practical means to convince VFR rated pi- lots to stay out of IFR
   conditions, and increases aware- ness among IFR rated pilots that they
   are not imper- vious to the effects of spatial disorientation simply
   because they hold an IFR rating. Global Survival Course The Global
   Survival Course provides the neces- sary knowledge and skills for
   coping with various common survival scenarios including desert, arc-
   tic, and water environments following an emer- gency aircraft landing,
   ditching, or a crash. Prac- tice sessions are conducted using a thermal
   cham- ber, a ditching tank, and an emergency evacuation aircraft
   simulator. In addition, this course teaches how Figure 3. VRSDD to

   demonstration of the effects of spatial disorientation during flight.
   The key differ- ence between the VRSDD and other spatial disori-
   entation devices is that it immerses the pilot in a real time
   3-dimensional space. The VRSDD uti- lizes high resolution 3-dimensional
   imagery to cre- ate a flight environment which is "virtually" real. The
   user has a real time interaction with the vir- tual environment by
   becoming part of it and by being able to manipulate/control it. Virtual
   reality is an effective, efficient, and inherently safe tech- nology
   that can be used to simulate logistically impractical, expensive, or
   even dangerous real world settings (i.e., aviation and space environ-
   Figure 4. Fire Starting Demonstration ments, medical procedures, etc.).
   The VRSDD is being used by civil aviation pilots, aviation medical
   examiners, and FAA flight crews participating in Aviation Physiology
   training courses offered at CAMI. It is also being used in support of
   the National Accident Prevention Program through- out the U.S. It
   provides civil aviation pilots with the opportunity to experience, in
   an inherently safe envi- ronment, certain vestibular illusions that
   occur dur- ing IFR conditions. The VRSDD provides a practi- cal and
