                                   Welcome

   The National Institutes of Health offers a variety of opportunities for
   individuals who seek research training prior to furthering their
   education or in preparation for careers as laboratory support
   personnel. These opportunities are available on the main campus of the
   NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, and other off-campus locations in Baltimore
   and Frederick, Maryland; Research Triangle Park, North Carolina;
   Phoenix, Arizona; and Hamilton, Montana. Using the Intramural Research
   Training Award Program (IRTA) authority, the NIH supports three
   training programs that are intended to facilitate the realization of
   these objectives.
