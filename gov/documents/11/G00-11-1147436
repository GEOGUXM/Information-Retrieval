                                pHIND vectors

   The pHIND series of plasmids were developed to allow us to perform
   nested deletions in both directions. These also have color selection,
   are fairly small and are compatible with preexisting protocols. We have
   found the pHIND2.2 to be the most useful one of this series. The others
   lack the lacZ complementing region so don't allow color selection of
   the clones.
