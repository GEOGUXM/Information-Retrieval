   NETL Site Search
   Use the form below to search for documents in this web containing
   specific words or combinations of words. The text search engine will
   display a weighted list of matching documents, with better matches
   shown first. Each list item is a link to a matching document; if the
   document has a title it will be shown, otherwise only the document's
   file name is displayed. A brief explanation of the query language is
   available, along with examples.
