                               ARUBA ECLIPSE
   Last February, a group of student SPIs, accompanied by Barbara Scott
   (from EOS-PM Project) and David Beverley Sr. (Outreach Computer
   Specialist) took a trip to Aruba for the Total Solar Eclipse. Carrying
   two racks of computer and networking equipment, a tiny microwave
   satellite dish providing T1-speed Internet connectivity, and plenty of
   sunscreen, the SPIs documented the whole experience. This was a joint
   project with "The Exploratorium" in San Fransisco, The Minneapolis
   Museum of Science, and The Discovery Channel Online.
   Another team of students remained at Goddard and monitored the weather
   using computers to analyze live satellite data, giving the Aruba team
   an up-to-the-minute idea of what kind of weather to expect for the
   eclipse. Check out the students' accounts of the trip, the
   preparations, and the results here.
   Here's an account of the "Aruba Trip" from Michaela Gruzensky, a
   fourteen year old "home-schooler" who actually went to Aruba.

   On September 17th, 1998, Mike and Dave traveled to Red Cloud Indian
   School in Pine Ridge, SD. They installed a GOES satellite antenna, set
   up five GVAR machines, and learned a little something about donkeys.

   NASA Mike, our enigmatic man-in-charge, is quite the traveler. He's
   been around the world five times, including a recent trip to the
   Antarctic. He has several pages of gorgeous pictures, from several
   places around the world.
