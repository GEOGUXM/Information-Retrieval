             Students in Puerto Rico using the Natural Inquirer

     The Natural Inquirer is a science education resource journal to be
     used   with learners from grade 5 and older.  The Natural Inquirer
    contains natural resource research articles conducted by USDA Forest
    Service scientists.  These are scientific journal articles that have
    been reformatted to meet the needs of an audience who are new to the
     area of science.  The articles are easier to understand, shortened,
   more aesthetically pleasing to the eye, contain glossaries, and include
    hands-on activities.  The goal of the magazine is critical thinking,
   scientific inquiry, and investigation while learning about our natural
                       resources and the environment.
