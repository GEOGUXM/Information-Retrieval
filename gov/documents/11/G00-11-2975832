                        Principia Cybernetica Mailing Lists


   The Principia Cybernetica Project uses two lists for quickly
   distributing information by electronic mail: PCP-news for
   announcements, PCP-discuss for discussions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PCP-news: announcements

      PCP-news is a mailing list, maintained at the [externallink.GIF] Free
      University of Brussels, which automatically distributes announcements
      to all subscribers. This list is low-volume. Its main function is to
      distribute a 2-monthly Newsletter (see the PCP-news digest for a
      summary of the news distributed in the past few years).

      Exceptionally, it also carries messages with information for all people
      interested in PCP, e.g. conference announcements, Calls for Papers, new
      publications, new services, etc. This makes it easier for subscribers
      who don't like to get a lot of email, but still want to be kept
      informed about important events connected to the Principia Cybernetica
      Project. The list is moderated: only messages explicitly approved by
      the listowner (Francis Heylighen) are broadcasted. Replies by default
      go to the individual who sent the message, and not to the list.

      If you prefer a more frequent and interactive mailing list, you may
      apply to join our non-moderated list PCP-discuss (membership conditions
      are minimal). All messages to PCP-news are simultaneously transmitted
      to PCP-discuss (but not the other way around), so in any case you need
      only one subscription. PCP-news carries maximally 2 or 3 messages a
      month, while, like most discussion lists, the activity on PCP-discuss
      can fluctuate widely, from about 10 to about 100 messages a month.

      Unlike PCP-discuss, you can automatically subscribe yourself to
      PCP-news. You will then get an introductory message about the mailing
      list, and start receiving all broadcasts on the list. You can
      unsubscribe in the same simple way.

   PCP-discuss: discussion

      PCP-discuss is a majordomo discussion list run from the Los Alamos
      National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and administered by
      Cliff Joslyn. It replaces the list

        PRNCYB-L@BINGVMB.CC.BINGHAMTON.EDU

      previously administered by Cliff from Binghamton University until 1999.

      PCP-discuss provides an open forum for all participants in the project,
      allowing direct discussions about all issues related to PCP.
      Subscribers are encouraged to send replies to the whole list (this is
      the default), and not to individuals, so that everybody can participate
      in the discussions. Participants who wish to contribute to PCP can post
      their ideas to PCP-discuss. Proposals for new nodes or comments on
      existing nodes are best discussed there.

      At present, over 100 people, representing the five continents,
      subscribe to PCP-discuss. The mailing list is of moderate volume (a few
      messages per week on average), but like all discussion lists this can
      fluctuate very widely. Messages can be long and informative. Some
      topics that have been discussed include: entropy increase and
      self-organization, causality as covariation, thermodynamics and
      evolution of mortality, memetics and the evolution of cooperation,
      formal expression, criteria for reality, values and religion,
      definitions of "control", complexity and the edge of chaos, Robert
      Rosen's theory of anticipatory systems, etc. A selection of relevant
      information (e.g. congress announcements, publications; on hypertext,
      electronic publishing, evolution of the brain, ...) from other
      electronic forums is regularly cross-posted on PCP-discuss.

      [externallink.GIF] Bruce Edmonds maintains an [externallink.GIF]
      archive of PRNCYB-L/PCP-discuss messages, sorted according to topic,
      date and author, and going back to the beginning of 1995. This includes
      a [externallink.GIF] searchable index.

      PCP-discuss is not meant for casual chats, "flame wars", or
      uninformative technicalities. Nor is it meant as a general forum for
      discussion about cybernetics and systems science: other mailing lists,
      e.g. CYBCOM, already exist elsewhere. Whereas these lists are open to
      anyone with an interest in cybernetics and systems, PCP-discuss is
      restricted to active participants and those who wish to be informed
      about the specifics of PCP.

   How does it work?

      The functioning of the lists are very simple. If you are subscribed
      toPCP-discuss, you will automatically and immediately receive at your
      email address all messages sent to either PCP-discuss orPCP-news. Once
      subscribed, if you wish to contribute yourself, you just send an e-mail
      message to the list address pcp-discuss@listserv.lanl.gov, (or reply to
      a message that you received from pcp-discuss) and it will be
      automatically broadcasted to all others who have subscribed. In that
      way you can mail out e.g. questions, proposals, or reactions.

      If you wish to join PCP-discuss, please send in the subscription form.
      You will then be added to the mailing list, and receive initial
      instructions on how to operate the majordomo software (as subscription
      is done manually, this may take several days).

      For more detailed procedures on how to operate the PCP-discuss server,
      check the common majordomo commands (note that most of these commands
      can only be used by people who have been manually subscribed to the
      list).
