          ________________________________________________________

   The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is responsible for the
   regulation of exports for national security, foreign policy, and
   nonproliferation reasons and the enforcement of those regulations.
   BXA's Special Agents for Export Enforcement carryout these
   responsibilities.  This page provides links to information on BXA's
