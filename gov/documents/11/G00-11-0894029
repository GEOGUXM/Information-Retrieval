     [HPVcover94.jpg] [HPVcover95.jpg] [HPVcover96.jpg] [HPVcover97.gif]

   The Human Papillomaviruses Database collects, curates, analyzes, and
   publishes genetic sequences of papillomaviruses and related cellular
   proteins. Our group includes molecular biologists, sequence analysts,
   computer technicians, post-docs and graduate research assistants. We
   are located at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the Theoretical
   Biology and Biophysics Group and are funded by the Division of
   Microbiology and Infectious Diseases of the National Institute of
   Allergy and Infectious Diseases through an interagency agreement with
   the Department of Energy. More information about database staff,
   address and phone is here.

   This Web site has two main branches. The first contains our four annual
   data books of papillomavirus information, called Human
   Papillomaviruses: A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino
   Acid Sequences. and the second contains papillomavirus genetic sequence
   data. There is also a New Items location where we store the latest
   changes to the database or any other current news of interest. We
   provide links to other molecular biology information sources on the
   Web.

   Here are some links to information about medical and public health
   aspects of papillomavirus infections.

   We appreciate receiving your comments, queries, and criticisms about
   this Web site.

I. The HPV Compendium

   Each year we publish a compendium of papillomavirus information called
   Human Papillomaviruses: A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and
   Amino Acid Sequences. which can now be downloaded from this Web site.
   The 1997 Compendium was released to the Web on October 23. Included in
   the Compendium and its predecessors are
     * genetic sequences (in GenBank format) of most of the known
       papillomaviruses,
     * alignments of the papillomavirus genes,
     * phylogenetic trees of the papillomavirus groups,
     * analyses of papillomvirus genomes,
     * related cellular protein sequences, and
     * bibliographic information about the papillomaviruses.

II. Data

   Besides the compendium, we also provide genetic sequence information
   for papilloma viruses and related cellular proteins.

New Items

   On October 23, 1997 we published the 1997 version of Human
   Papillomaviruses. Subscribers should be receiving their hard copies of
   this book around mid-November.

   We have alignments of a number of papillomavirus types and their
   variants that you can download. These alignments were the basis for the
   Survey of Papillomavirus Variants article that appears in the 96
   compendium. If you have new variants and wish to see how they compare
   with other known variants these files will be of interest.

    Links to Public Health Sources

   Our group concentrates on molecular aspects of the human papillomavirus
   proteins and nucleic acids. We are not qualified to provide information
   about HPV infections from a medical or public health standpoint. Please
   do not contact us with health-related questions. For answers to your
   questions, you might wish to contact the following:
     * The American Social Health Assocation, whose National Sexually
       Transmitted Disease Hotline can be reached at 800/227-8922. They
       should be able to provide you with information about the HPV
       Support Program, which produces a news letter called "HPV News",
       and coordinates local support groups.
     * The WWW homepage for the National Cancer Institute, or,
       gopher://gopher.nih.gov/11/clin/cancernet. From the latter, you
       could do a search for "papillomavirus".
