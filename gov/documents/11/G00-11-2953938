       Recent measurements carried out by the Supernova Cosmology Project
    (SCP) and the High-Z Supernova team have made the startling discovery
     that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. This result is
      based on the Hubble diagram for type Ia supernovae, and has been
     corroborated by results from several experiments, both similar and
    complementary. Einstein's General Theory of Relativity requires that
   some mechanism must drive this expansion rate either through a new form
   of energy, such as a new vacuum energy density (cosmological constant),
   or a yet unknown kind of particle or field fundamental to the creation
   and formation of the universe. The source of this acceleration is more
   powerful than the gravitation from all seen and unseen forms of matter
    and known energy. Theorists are unable to explain the observed effect
   and follow-up measurements would have a tremendous impact on the field
      of fundamental physics. The Supernova / Acceleration Probe (SNAP)
   Mission is expected to provide a understanding of the mechanism driving
   the acceleration of the universe. The satellite observatory is capable
   of measuring up to 2,000 distant supernovae each year of the three-year
       mission lifetime. These measurements will map out in detail the
   expansion rate of the universe at epochs varying from the present to 10
   billion years in the past. SNAP will determine the spatial curvature of
       the universe thus providing a fundamental test of the theory of
   inflation - the theoretical mechanism that drove the initial formation
      of the universe, and a measure of the key cosmological parameters
        Omega[m] and Omega[L]. This sensitive experiment uses type Ia
     supernovae as an astronomical standard candle to provide a distance
     scale, which, combined with the redshift obtained from the spectral
   lines from the supernova and its host galaxy determine the cosmological
     parameters and ultimately the nature of the "missing energy" in the
        universe. Type II supernovae are also expected to provide an
   independent precision measurement of cosmological parameters using the
       blackbody emission from the hot type II photosphere to obtain a
                         luminosity-distance scale.

     Please note that SNAP is still in the proposal stage and that many
    features of the satellite are being designed and revised.  Therefore,
   technical specifications of the satellite are subject to change and all
   images should be considered artistic interpretations of what SNAP might
                          look like in the future.
