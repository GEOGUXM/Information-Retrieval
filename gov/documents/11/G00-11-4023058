Decision Index Introduction

   The PERB Decision Index is organized by subject matter with each topic
   being assigned a topical number.  For example, the topic "PERB:
   Operation, Jurisdiction, Authority; Operation of EERA, Dills (SEERA),
   HEERA - In General" is number 100.01000.  For each Board decision, as
   well as a small number of important court decisions, brief summary
   statements (or headnotes) have been developed for each topic that the
   decision addressed.
   The PERB Decision Search Engine allows searches of these headnotes in
   any of three ways: The user may simply browse the topical index and
   pull up all headnotes entered under a topic; or do a word search of the
   index; or do a word search of the headnotes themselves.  The PERB
   Decision Search Engine DOES NOT allow a search of the decisions' text.
   Each headnote identifies the decision it summarizes by the decision
   number.  A number which has no preceding letter refers to the PERB
   Decision of that number.  The preceding letter "A" refers to an
   administrative appeal decision; the letter "I" refers to an injunctive
   relief decision; the letter "J" refers to a judicial review decision;
   and the letter "C" refers to a court decision.  The letter following
   the decision number identifies the statute under which the case was
   decided ("E" refers to the Educational Employment Relations Act; "H"
   refers to the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act; and "S"
   refers to the Ralph C. Dills Act (formerly known as the State
   Employer-Employee Relations Act).
   The full citation (decision name, number and year decided) for each
   decision can be determined by accessing the numeric index of PERB
   decisions.
   Please note that PERB does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness
   of the index.  For this reason, the PERB Decision Search Engine should
   be used as an aid in legal research only.  The citations and holdings
   of the cases summarized herein should be checked for accuracy before
   they are used in legal documents.
