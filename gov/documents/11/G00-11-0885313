Introduction

   The Oceans and Ice branch of the Laboratory for Hydrospheric Physics of
   NASA/GSFC under the direction of Dr. H. Jay Zwally with contractor
   support from Raytheon ITSS has processed satellite radar and aircraft
   laser altimetry over the continental ice sheets and surrounding sea ice
   to calculate surface elevations. The radar processing is currently
   being funded by the NASA Mission to Planet Earth Pathfinder Program.
