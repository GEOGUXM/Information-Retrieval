   Overview
        __________________________________________________________________

      Inflation can be defined as the overall general upward price movement
      of goods and services in an economy. BLS has various indexes that
      measure different aspects of inflation.

   BLS statistics related to inflation:

      Consumer Price Index

      The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures inflation as experienced by
      consumers in their day-to-day living expenses. (It is sometimes
      referred to as the retail price index.) There are separate indexes for
      two groups or populations of consumers:
        * The CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) is the index most often
          reported by the national media.
        * The CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) is the
          index most often used for wage escalation agreements.
        * The CPI inflation calculator allows customers to calculate the
          value of current dollars in an earlier period, or to calculate the
          current value of dollar amounts from years ago.
        * Consumer price indexes often are used to escalate or adjust
          payments for rents, wages, alimony, child support and other
          obligations that may be affected by changes in the cost of living.
          There is a fact sheet explaining how to use the CPI for escalating
          contracts.

      Producer Price Indexes

      The Producer Price Indexes are a family of indexes that measure changes
   in the selling prices received by domestic producers of goods and
   services These used to be referred to as Wholesale Price Indexes. The
   news media will most often report the percentage change in the index
   for Finished Goods.
     * Producer Price Indexes can also be used in escalation contracts. A
       fact sheet explaining the details is available.

   Import and Export Prices

   The International Price Program measures change in the prices of
   imports and exports of nonmilitary goods between the United States and
   the rest of the world.

   Consumer Spending

   The Consumer Expenditure Survey measures the spending habits of
   American consumers and includes data on their expenditures, income, and
   characteristics.
