   The purpose of the ChildStats web site is to provide easy access to the
   reports of the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family
   Statistics, to improve access to data on children and their families
   across the federal agencies that produce the data, and to provide
   information about the activities of the Forum.

   We welcome your comments or suggestions for indicators of child
   well-being for the America's Children annual report, for other reports
   we might consider, and for suggestions to improve the reporting and
   dissemination of federal data on children and families generally.
