   [home.gif] What is Off-Site Source Recovery?

   The Off-Site Source Recovery (OSR) Project recovers and manages
   unwanted radioactive sealed sources and other radioactive material
   that:

   [bullet.gif]    present a risk to public health and safety,

   [bullet.gif]   present a potential loss of control by a Nuclear
   Regulatory
   Commission (NRC) or agreement state licensee.

   [bullet.gif]   are excess and unwanted and are a U.S. Department of
   Energy
   (DOE) responsibility under Public Law 99-240, or are DOE-owned.

   The project is sponsored by DOE's Office of Technical Program
   Integration
   (EM-22) and the Albuquerque Operations Office Waste Management Division
   and operates from Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). It focuses on
   the
   problem of sources and devices held under US Nuclear Regulatory
   Commission
   or agreement state licenses for which there is no disposal option.
   The project was reorganized in 1999 to more aggressively recover
   and manage the estimated 18,000 sealed source devices that will
   become excess and unwanted over the next decade. This
   reorganization combined three activities, the Radioactive Source
   Recovery Program, the Off-Site Waste Program, and the Pu-239/Be
   Neutron Source Project. For a copy of the OSR Project fact sheet

   Scope of the Problem

   The OSR Project Office maintains a comprehensive database of
   radioactive sealed sources. The map shows the known locations of
   various types of excess and unwanted sources.

   OSR Project Priorities for Fiscal Year 2002

   [bullet.gif]    Recover sources from commercial licensees holding fewer
   than 10 high activity sources.

   [bullet.gif]    Recover sources from state agencies who are holding
   at-risk sources accepted from licensees.

   [bullet.gif]   Provide assistance to universities for recovery of
   sources containing Pu-238 and Am-241, while pursuing solutions for
   Pu-239 source recoveries.
