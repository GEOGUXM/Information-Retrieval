   Information for NIMH Employees
         Across the broad spectrum of basic scientific and biomedical
   research conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),
   Division of Intramural Research Programs (DIRP), the NIMH Technology
   Transfer Office is responsible for implementing the Federal Technology
   Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA), as amended, and Executive Order No. 12591.
   At the heart of its activities is a deep and continuing commitment to
   further the Institute's tradition of scientific excellence as NIMH
   enters the 21st century. Accordingly, the Office carefully monitors,
   evaluates, and manages the Institute's invention portfolio. Beginning
   with rigorous review of Employee Invention Reports (EIRs), Office staff
   negotiate transactional agreements between NIMH and outside parties,
   including other Federal laboratories, State and local governments,
   universities, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

         Among these agreements are Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs)
   for the exchange of research materials, Cooperative Research and
   Developments Agreements (CRADAs) for collaborative research endeavors,
   Clinical Trial Agreements (CTAs) for the conduct of preclinical and
   clinical studies in human subjects, and Confidential Disclosure
   Agreements (CDAs) for the exchange of confidential information. The
   Office also pursues the execution of license agreements. Lastly, Office
   staff participate in scientific review meetings, discussions, and
   conferences, as appropriate, to best serve the needs of NIMH
   scientists. For more information on technology transfer opportunities
   at NIMH, please visit our information resources below.
