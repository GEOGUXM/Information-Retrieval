     USDA-ARS-WMU is committed to making its web sites accessible to all
     USDA customers and employees. All of the agency web sites are
     undergoing review and redesign as necessary to ensure that they meet
     or exceed the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act
     of 1973. Many of our web sites currently meet the Section 508
     accessibility standards. Furthermore, USDA-ARS-WMU continues to work
     on making all web sites accessible. Thank you very much for your
     patience through this redesign process. If you have any comments or
     suggestions for improvement, please contact the Web Master of this
     page.
