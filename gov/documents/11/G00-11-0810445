What is MIRO?

   MIRO (Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter) is a scientific
   instrument on the ROSETTA Spacecraft. MIRO will measure the near
   surface temperatures of the asteroids OTAWARA and SIWA, and the comet
   WIRTANEN, thereby allowing scientists to estimate the thermal and
   electrical properties of these surfaces. In addition, the spectrometer
   portion of MIRO will allow measurements of water, carbon monoxide,
   ammonia, and methanol in the gaseous coma of comet WIRTANEN. These
   measurements will allow scientists to study how the comet material
   sublimates (changes from its frozen state, ice, to a gas) in time and
   distance from the sun.

   The data from MIRO, along with data from other instruments on the
   orbiter and the comet lander, will give scientists a better idea of how
   comets formed, what they are made of and how they change with time.
