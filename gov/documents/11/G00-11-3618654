   NOTE:

   NIH Consensus Statements are prepared by a nonadvocate, non-Federal
   panel of experts, based on (1) presentations by investigators working
   in areas relevant to the consensus questions during a 2-day public
   session; (2) questions and statements from conference attendees during
   open discussion periods that are part of the public session; and (3)
   closed deliberations by the panel during the remainder of the second
   day and morning of the third. This statement is an independent report
   of the panel and is not a policy statement of the NIH or the Federal
   Government.

   The statement reflects the panel√≠s assessment of medical knowledge
   available at the time the statement was written. Thus, it provides a
   "snapshot in time" of the state of knowledge on the conference topic.
   When reading the statement, keep in mind that new knowledge is
   inevitably accumulating through medical research.
