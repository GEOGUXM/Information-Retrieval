                                LASRC Mission

     The Los Alamos Seismic Research Center (LASRC) is a unified team of
     scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) that focuses on
     basic and applied research on a wide range of seismic phenomena.
     Current areas of expertise include: crustal imaging on all scales,
     seismic wave propagation and source modeling, seismic hazards
     assessment, paleoseismology, Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
     verification, nonlinear acoustics, oil and gas
     exploration/production, interaction of seismic waves with fluids in
     porous media, and educational outreach programs.
