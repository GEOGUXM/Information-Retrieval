                 Benton fights to keep efficiency measures intact
                      as Senate passes transportation package



   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
   January 26, 2002

                                                   FOR INTERVIEWS CONTACT:
                                         Senator Don Benton (360) 786-7632


   OLYMPIA...On the Senate floor today, Senator Don Benton, R-Vancouver,
   fought to remove a clause in the transportation package that makes all
   transportation efficiency measures passed this biennium “null and void”
   if the new revenue package is not passed by the Legislature.

   “We need to change the way we do things to make transportation more
   efficient regardless of whether or not we enact a new revenue package,”
   said Benton, ranking Republican on the Senate Transportation Committee.
   Benton’s amendment was voted down by a close margin before the Senate
   unanimously passed House Bill 2304, the transportation efficiencies
   package.

   “I am disappointed that the ‘null and void’ clause is still in effect,
   but we have worked hard to make a good transportation efficiencies
   package even better,” Benton added.  “It is time to move forward to
   solve the transportation problems for the people of our state.”

   HB 2304 now returns to the House for consideration of Senate
   Transportation Committee amendments.
          Transportation efficiency bills enacted into law last year:

   ¨      SHB 1680 - allowing contractors to handle both the design and
   building phases of projects, more commonly referred to as the
   “design-build” bill; and

   ¨      ESB 6188 - streamlining the permit process.
   Bills passed by the Senate this year include:

   ¨      ESSB 5743 – Increasing the number of apprenticeships and
   training programs to ensure there will be enough skilled workers to
   deliver transportation projects;

   ¨      SSB 5748 – Integrating transportation and land-use planning;

   ¨      2ESSB 5749 – Adopting a cost-benefit analysis for transportation
   planning;

   ¨      ESSB 5759 – Improving traffic chokepoints by requiring priority
   programming for transportation improvements to be based on traffic
   congestion and a benefit-cost analysis to determine the value of the
   proposed project;

   ¨      ESSB 5760 – Directing the use of intelligent transportation
   systems and traffic system management to improve the highway system’s
   performance and capacity;

   ¨      2ESSB 5764 – Requiring certain city and county entities to take
   certain steps to help maintain and preserve transportation facilities
   and assets; and

   ¨     ESHB 2304 – ties together several of the Blue Ribbon Commission
   on Transportation efficiencies, including provisions that include
   setting policy goals based on Blue Ribbon benchmark recommendations,
   contracting out transportation construction engineering services,
   transportation apprenticeships and prevailing wage assessments, and
   transportation planning and efficiencies.
