   SQUARE New edible coatings are being developed to extend the shelf life
           of whole and minimally processed frts and vegetables. The development
               of alternative coatings for apples with novel ingredients is
              continuing, and new research is being conducted to find optimal
                          coatings for specialty citrus fruit.
   SQUARE      Novel approaches are being used to develop new value added
            products from citrus byproducts, and to enhance yield and product
                                        quality.
   SQUARE   Multivariate analysis programs are being used to correlate
          flavor components to processing and storage history of juices, and to
                    serve as quantitative measures of flavor quality.
   SQUARE  Compounds with significant pharmacological activity are being
             extracted from citrus byproducts, and tested for their effect on
                               certain disease conditions.
