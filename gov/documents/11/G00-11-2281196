   Paige Announces Historically Black Colleges and Universities and
   Hispanic-Serving Institutions to Get More Than $350 Million
   President's FY 2003 budget request will increase support for colleges
   and universities serving minority and disadvantaged students
   FOR RELEASE:
   January 21, 2002 Contact: Lindsey Kozberg

   U.S. Secretary of Education Rod Paige today announced that President
   George W. Bush's budget request for the Education Department will
   include more than $350 million for programs that will strengthen
   Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Historically
   Black Graduate Institutions (HBGIs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions
   (HSIs)—an increase of more than $12 million over current funding
   levels.

   Paige described President Bush's commitment to meeting the needs of all
   of America's students—particularly students from minority and
   disadvantaged backgrounds—during his remarks at a citywide observance
   of the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in Washington, D.C.

   Paige reflected upon the significance of President Bush's commitment to
   educating America's youth through the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001,
   which he signed into law earlier this month. Noting that his commitment
   extends beyond elementary and secondary schools to expanding higher
   education opportunities, Paige announced that President Bush will
   continue to support funding increases for programs that support higher
   education institutions serving large numbers of minority students and
   will ask Congress for more than $264 million in federal support for
   HBCUs and HBGIs for fiscal year 2003.

   President Bush's budget request for fiscal year 2003 will also include
   a request for more than $89 million to support HSIs in order to help
   close the attainment gap between Hispanic students and their peers.

   "To honor the legacy of Dr. King, we must continue to support the
   institutions that offer our minority and disadvantaged students
   opportunities through higher education," Paige said. "We have committed
   the resources we need to get that job done, and we will continue to
   work to make sure that every student in America can achieve, and no
   child is left behind."

   The following are details regarding President Bush's budget request for
   fiscal year 2003 for HBCUs, HBGIs and HSIs:
     * President Bush has pledged to increase funding for HBCUs, HBGIs and
       HSIs by 30 percent between 2001 and 2005 in an effort to expand
       access to postsecondary education opportunities for students from
       minority and disadvantaged backgrounds.
     * African-American students have lagged behind other groups of
       students in educational attainment such as in acquisition of
       advanced degrees in science, engineering and mathematics. By
       contributing to the financial stability of institutions that serve
       African-American students President Bush is asking Congress to help
       close that attainment gap.
     * President Bush will call on Congress to increase funding for HBCUs
       by $7.4 million—a 3.6 percent increase over 2002 funding levels
       that will result in an estimated average award of more than $2
       million each for the almost 100 eligible HBCUs.
     * President Bush will also call on Congress to increase funding for
       HBGIs by $1.8 million—a 3.6 percent increase over 2002 funding
       levels that will result in an estimated average award of almost $3
       million for the almost 20 eligible HBGIs.
     * Hispanics make up the fastest growing segment of our K-12 public
       school system. However only 10% of Hispanics obtain a college
       education according to the Department of Education statistics. By
       supporting HSIs President Bush is seeking to offer greater
       opportunities for this expanding segment of the American
       population.
     * To enhance the academic quality, management and stability of
       colleges and universities that enroll large percentages of Hispanic
       students, President Bush is asking Congress to increase support for
       these institutions by $3.1 million over 2002 funding levels—a 3.6
       percent increase that is expected to expand the number of colleges
       and universities receiving grants through the Developing
       Hispanic-Serving Institutions program to almost 200 eligible
       institutions.

   Paige's announcement follows President Bush's comments during his
   weekend radio address that he will continue to work to expand
   opportunities for all Americans through education and will ask Congress
   to increase federal funding for Title I Grants to Local Education
   Agencies by $1 billion this year in an effort to support the needs of
   disadvantaged students across the country. In his radio address,
   President Bush also announced that he will ask Congress to increase
   funding for federal support for states in meeting the needs of students
   with disabilities by $1 billion.
