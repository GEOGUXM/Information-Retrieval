       The Supercritical Fluids Experimentation Team examines solvent
   replacement technology utilizing dense phase fluids. Dense-phase fluids
       are preferred over conventional solvents in areas where either
   environmental concerns are sensitive or the physical properties of the
   fluid provide an enabling technology (e.g., DryWash, SCORR). Click the
     Supercritical Fluids (SCF) link at the top or bottom of any page to
                              visit their site.
