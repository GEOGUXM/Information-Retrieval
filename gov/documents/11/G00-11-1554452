     __________________________________________________________________

   Safety Recommendations are issued by the NTSB as a result of the
   investigation of transportation accidents and other safety problems.
   Recommendations usually identify a specific problem uncovered during an
   investigation or study and specify how to correct the situation.
   Letters containing the recommendations are directed to the organization
   best able to act on the problem, whether it be public or private.
