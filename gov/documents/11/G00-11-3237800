   Welcome to the Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics. The Laboratory is an
   intramural research program within the National Heart Lung and Blood
   Institute in Bethesda Maryland. The Chief of the Laboratory is Dr.
   Robert S.Balaban, Ph.D.
   The major goal of the Laboratory is a better understanding of the
   complex physiology of the cardiovascular system. Towards this goal, the
   Laboratory specializes in the use of non-invasive technologies to
   follow physiological processes in man and model systems. The Laboratory
   also has a very active clinical program evaluating the use of magnetic
   resonance imaging in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.



       The Laboratory is composed of four major sections:
     * Imaging Physics (Dr. Han Wen, Ph.D.)
     * Cardiovascular Imaging (Dr. Andrew Arai, MD)
     * Medical Imaging (Dr. Elliot McVeigh Ph.D.)
     * Integrative Physiology (Dr. Robert S. Balaban Ph.D.)
