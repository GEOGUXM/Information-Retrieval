                         Sea Otter Contaminant Study

     Predators throughout the world's oceans are struggling with
     contamination. Toxins become concentrated at the top of the food
     chain because predators consume all the contaminants that their prey
     have ever taken in. Sea otters are especially vulnerable because
     they consume a relatively large proportion of their body weight
     every day. For this reason, researchers in the Sanctuary have been
     capturing live sea otters, drawing blood and giving them a physical
     in order to create a baseline study of their health.

       Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary staff assist with NOAA's
                         Ocean's Exploration project:
                          The Lewis and Clark Legacy

     Researchers Ed Bowlby and Mary Sue Brancato explored Astoria Canyon
     with NOAA's Ocean Exploration project. Astoria Canyon lies just ten
     miles offshore from the mouth of the Columbia River between
     Washington and Oregon. This exciting geological area yields rich
     opportunities to learn more about benthic communities off the
     Pacific Northwest Coast.
     Bowlby and Brancato accompanied the exploration to assist with the
     collection of photos and specimens of invertebrates, fish and
     seafloor sediments. Following the Ocean Exploration Project, the
     Sanctuary sponsored a project using the assembled equipment to
     conduct multibeam and sidescan sonar mapping in the Quinault canyon.
     Education Coordinator Bob Steelquist contributed an essay on Lewis
     and Clark for the project website. Click here to read the article.

        NOAA & Coast Guard Gain Approval for Greater Ship Safety Along
                                Olympic Coast

         International Body Approves Preliminary Measures to Protect
                             Sanctuary Resources

     The National Ocean Service, an agency of the Commerce Department's
     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U. S.
     Coast Guard received preliminary international approval to expand
     existing protective measures for the Olympic Coast National Marine
     Sanctuary.
     The measures would move large commercial ships further offshore,
     reducing the threat of an oil spill to the sanctuary.
     The Subcommittee on Safety of Navigation of the International
     Maritime Organization (IMO), a London-based body that regulates
     ocean-going shipping, heard the proposal this week to modify the
     existing "Area-To-Be Avoided" (ATBA).
     An ATBA is an area that all ships or certain classes of ships should
     avoid because navigation is particularly hazardous or where it is
     exceptionally important to avoid casualties within the area.
     Return to top
     The proposal consists of two parts. First, it increases the size of
     the ATBA to the north and west of the sanctuary to provide a greater
     margin of safety around the navigational hazards of Duntze and
     Duncan rocks and Tatoosh Island.
     Second, the ATBA would also apply to ships greater than 1600 gross
     tons, regardless of their cargo, that are transiting the area. These
     ships carry large amounts of bunker fuel which, if spilled, would be
     extremely harmful to the unique, valuable and sensitive resources of
     the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary.
     Vessels that are engaged in activities allowed in the sanctuary,
     such as fishing, would not be affected by the proposed changes. The
     voluntary nature of the ATBA was also evaluated and will remain in
     place.
     "Since 1995, tank vessels carrying cargoes of petroleum and
     hazardous materials have been routed outside the ATBA. Although the
     measure is voluntary, compliance has been high," said Carol
     Bernthal, superintendent of NOAA's Olympic Coast National Marine
     Sanctuary. "The marine transportation industry has been very
     cooperative because they recognize that an oil spill would have a
     devastating impact on this ecological treasure."
     The entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, located within the
     marine sanctuary, is one of the busiest intersections on the West
     Coast. The proposal was developed based on existing vessel traffic
     patterns and oil spill risk studies.
     Additional input was sought through consultations with the Canadian
     Government; members of the public including representatives of the
     shipping industry, master mariners, ports, pilots and environmental
     interests; and representatives of U.S. federal, state, local and
     tribal governments.
     Return to top
     "While the existing program has proven successful, the future poses
     a different set of risks and we are pleased that the IMO is
     addressing them," Bernthal said.
     NOAA officials also worked closely with the United States Coast
     Guard as they developed recommendations for changes to the traffic
     lanes entering the Strait of Juan de Fuca to improve navigation
     safety and increase protection for marine resources. This proposal
     also received preliminary approval from the IMO. The result of these
     efforts will be a win-win situation for both the marine industry and
     the environment.
     "The Coast Guard is passionate about the marine environment here in
     the Pacific Northwest and believes that these waterways are safe,
     however, improvements can always be made", said Captain John
     Veentjer of the Thirteenth Coast Guard District. "The proposed
     changes to the vessel routing and traffic separation schemes, which
     were developed in cooperation with our Canadian neighbors who share
     in the management of these waters and with representative input from
     waterway users, will further reduce the risk of vessel accidents on
     these waterways."
     Final designation of these protective measures must also be approved
     and adopted by the IMO's Maritime Safety Committee when it meets in
     May 2002. The target for implementation of these measures is
     December 2002.

                        Environmental Impact Statement
                                   for the
                       Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery

     The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is preparing an
     environmental impact statement (EIS) on the federal management of
     the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery in the Exclusive Economic Zone
     off Washington, Oregon, and California.
     The EIS analysis include all activities authorized under the Pacific
     Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) and all amendments to
     the FMP. The EIS will present an overall picture of the effects of
     fishing, as conducted under the groundfish FMP, on the human
     environment.
     A range of reasonable management alternatives and an analysis of
     their impacts will be included in the document. Management
     alternatives will be assessed for impacts on essential fish habitat,
     target and non-target species, discarded fish, marine mammals, and
     other protected species present in the Pacific Coast ecosystem.
     In addition, an analysis of socio-economic impacts of the fishery
     and of the fishery's management on the following groups of
     individuals will be included:

     (1) Those who participate in harvesting the fishery resources and
     other living marine resources;
     (2) those who process and market the fish and fish products;
     (3) those who are involved in allied support industries;
     (4) those who consume fish products;
     (5) those who rely on living marine resources in the management
     area, either for subsistence needs or for recreational benefits;
     (6) those who benefit from non-consumptive uses of living marine
     resources;
     (7) those involved in managing and monitoring fisheries; and (8)
     fishing communities.
