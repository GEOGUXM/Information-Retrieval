   General Overview:

   The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the largest labor statistics
   organization in the world and has provided international training since
   1945. Each year, the BLS International Labor Statistics Center conducts
   seminars of 4 to 6 weeks duration at its training facilities in
   Washington, D.C. In addition to the annual international seminars, the
   Center organizes visits to the BLS for over 300 international visitors
   each year.

   The seminars bring together statisticians, economists, analysts, and
   other data users from countries all over the world. Each seminar is
   designed to strengthen the participants' ability to collect and analyze
   economic and labor statistics. Each seminar includes a field trip, as
   well as lectures, discussions, and workshops.

   In addition to the scheduled seminars, customized programs in labor
   statistics can be arranged. Customized programs can be scheduled
   between seminars, for participants attending more than one program, or
   at any other time of the year.

   The language of instruction for both seminars and customized programs
   is English, and a reading knowledge of English is desirable. If
   necessary, simultaneous interpretation services may be arranged for an
   approximate cost of $550 per day.

   In addition to its Washington-based training, BLS can conduct seminars
   overseas on request. Such seminars can be held either for a single
   country or for several countries in the same region. BLS also makes
   available technical experts to serve overseas, at the request of
   individual governments or international organizations.
                                                                         Top

   Customized Programs:

   Customized programs at BLS

   In addition to scheduled seminars, the International Labor Statistics
   Center (ILSC) may arrange customized programs upon request on any topic
   related to labor statistics for individual participants or small
   groups. For example, customized programs have been conducted on
   occupational safety and health statistics, managing statistical
   programs, and sampling methodology. Such programs may range in duration
   from 1 week to a month or longer. The content of each program is
   individually designed to meet the needs of the participant(s), and may
   include attendance at selected seminar sessions, consultations with
   subject matter specialists, or partipation in or design of research
   projects to provide practical experience in the subject area.
   Customized programs may include field trips to other U.S. cities.

   Customized programs also may be arranged for the periods before or
   after a scheduled seminar for participants enrolled in the seminar
   program. The cost of each program depends upon program duration, the
   amount of domestic travel required, and any additional administrative
   costs incurred.

   Overseas seminars

   The Bureau of Labor Statistics may hold overseas seminars on selected
   topics in labor statistics for participants from a particular country
   or region. Most overseas seminars are from 2 to 4 weeks in duration.

   The cost of overseas seminars depends upon the number of instructors
   required, the duration of the seminar, travel and per diem costs, and
   cost of simultaneous interpretation and translation of materials (if
   needed). Where a number of participants from one country or region need
   training in the same subject area, an overseas seminar may be
   cost-effective. Because of the lead-time that is required to plan an
   overseas seminar, requests for such programs should be submitted to the
   International Labor Statistics Center at least 6 months in advance of
   the desired starting date.

   Consultations

   BLS also makes available technical experts to serve as consultants. The
   cost of these services includes the expert's salary and benefits for
   the duration of the consultation, airfare, lodging, meals, and other
   expenses, as well as an administrative fee. Requests for technical
   experts should include a clear statement of the purpose of the
   consultation.
                                                                         Top
   International Visitors:

   International visitors

   Short-term international visitors are welcome at BLS, free of charge.
   The International Labor Statistics Center organizes visits to BLS for
   more than 300 persons each year. Visits are arranged for individuals,
   as well as for groups of all sizes. Visitors include economists,
   statisticians, researchers, analysts, managers, academics, trade union
   representatives, business leaders, and journalists.

   A typical visit lasts about two hours. Meetings are conducted in
   English. Non-English speaking visitors should bring their own
   interpreter. Every visit is unique and is organized to meet the needs
   and interests of the visitor(s).

   How to request a visit

   Requests for visits to BLS should be made as far in advance as
   possible, and include the following information:
     * Preferred dates and time of visit to the BLS;
     * Number of participants and their names;
     * Names of interpreters, when applicable;
     * Topic(s) of interest (as detailed as possible);
     * Mention of any previous visits;

   Requests for customized programs, overseas seminars, consultations, and
   visits may be made by letter, telephone, fax, or e-mail

   Security procedures

   Everyone is required to enter the Bureau of Labor Statistics through
   the First Street, NE entrance (between Massachusetts Avenue and G

   equipment. Cameras are prohibited inside BLS.
