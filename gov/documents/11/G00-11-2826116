   purchasers of digital data may incorporate them into value-added works

   County is copyrighted by the County and is used here by permission."
   Hamilton County hereby grants Customer the right to install any
   electronic data acquired in this transaction on one computer and to
   make one or more archival copies for purposes of backing up the data.
   The data may be stored on a network computer for viewing by multiple
   users, but copies cannot be created for distribution or installation on
   multiple computers unless Customer has acquired the required site or
   distribution license.  In the case of products acquired on physical
   media, such as paper or film, Customer is granted the right to make
   photocopies for his or her own use; however, distribution of those
   copies to others is prohibited.  Distribution for profit, off-site use,
   or cost recovery is expressly prohibited unless granted by a
   distribution license, except that a single user may place the data on
   multiple computers (e.g., a desktop computer and a laptop computer) as
   long as more than one computer is not in use at the same time.

   In the case of ordered map products, Customer hereby accepts full
   responsibility for the correct identification of map sheets, data sets,
   and/or map layers needed to fulfill the intended purpose.  Refunds of
   any required deposit or other payment will be based solely on Hamilton
   County's inability to supply the requested data within a reasonable
   time period and will not be made on the Customer's mistaken selection.

   Hamilton County hereby declares that the maps it produced were prepared
   with the greatest possible care and in accordance with professional
   practice standards; however, Hamilton County cannot be held liable for
   any mistakes of omission or commission.  Information regarding the
   methods of compiling and maintaining each data product is available
   prior to acquisition.  The Customer is hereby notified that the map
   sheets, data sets, and/or map layers may be considered correct only at
   the time of the original data collection upon which they are based.
   Hamilton County's liability is limited to replacement of the product
   due to a defect in reproduction.  Inspect products within three (3)
   days of receipt; replacement of defective products discovered at a
   later time may not be authorized.
   Hamilton County can make no statements regarding the accuracy or
   suitability of products created by others and listed on this site as an
   aid to the participating agencies and our customers.
