   Australia Contacting the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission

   Complaint and inquiries

   You can contact your local ACCC office by

   Phone on +61 2 6243 1111;
   Fax on +61 2 6243 1196;
   Letter at P.O. Box 1199k, DICKSON  ACT 2602, AUSTRALIA

   or by using the email addresses listed below. Complaints may be made
   anonymously, but that usually limits the Commission's ability to
   respond.

   There is no fee or charge for making a complaint or inquiry.

   The Commission cannot give legal advice and recommends that a solicitor
   is the most appropriate person from whom to see such advice.

   The Commission mainly gives advice in English, and has limited
   facilities for receiving and responding to inquiries in other
   languages.
