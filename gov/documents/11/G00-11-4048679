   The recent determination of the genomic sequences of yeast, nematodes,
   fruit flies, mice, and humans is a watershed in biology. The Genome
   Sciences Department is focused to take advantage of this wealth of new
   information. It is well known that DNA encodes the basic blue print of
   life, but it is not known how to interpret most of this information,
   particularly that from animals with large genomes. To address this
   issue, laboratories within the department are developing computational,
   biochemical, and genetic methods to decipher the complex sequence
   motifs that control RNA transcription, DNA replication, and chromosome
   structure. In addition, complete genomic sequences open up entirely new
   ways to study human disease, the control of animal development, and
   complex macromolecular process such as meiosis. New techniques allow
   changes in the activity of all genes to be monitored simultaneously.
   Many groups within the department are using these methods to address a
   range of questions. We believe that the data from such system-wide
   analyses will fundamentally alter the way we think about most problems
   in biology.
   Members of the Genome Sciences Department also participate in: NHLBI's
   Programs for Genomic Applications project (PGA), DOE's Joint Genome
   Institute (JGI), the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP), and the
   Berkeley Program in Genomics, a program in which over 30 groups from
   LBNL and the University of California at Berkeley collaborate in a
   joint graduate program, seminar series, and annual retreat. We also
   make use of the outstanding engineering and computational resources at
   LBNL, such as the Bioinstrumentation Group and National Energy Research
   Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) .
