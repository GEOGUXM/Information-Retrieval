     The following data and maps are important tools to developing soil
                           moisture outlook maps.
     * Descriptions

     * Soil Moisture - A series of maps showing most recent day, monthly
       and 12 months calculated soil moisture, anomalies and percentiles;
       and a soil moisture & soil wetness climatology plus a changes in
       calculated soil moisture anomalies (millimeters) animated loop from
       January 1998 to the present.
     * Evaporation - A series of maps showing current month & most recent
       12 months average evaporation and anomalies; previous 12 months
       percentiles; and evaporation climatology.
     * Runoff - A series of maps showing current month and most recent 12
       months average runoff and anomalies; 12 months percentiles and
       runoff climatology.
     * Precipitation and Temperature - A series of maps showing current
       month and most recent 12 months accumulated total precipitation and
       average temperature, corresponding 12 months percentiles,
       climatology and 1- & 3-month outlooks.
     * Recent Anomalies - Maps showing the most recent day's soil moisture
       anomaly & percentile and current month's evaporation, runoff, total
       precipitation & average temperature anomalies.
     * Recent Changes - Maps showing the current month's soil moisture
       anomaly change from the previous 1- and 3-month periods.
     * Climatology - Monthly soil moisture, total precipitation, average
       temperature and evaporation climatology.
     * Drought Index - Objective Drought Index Percentile, Accumulated 30
       Day Precipitation Ranking Percentile, Palmer Index Ranking
       Percentile, Calculated Soil Moisture Ranking Percentile.
     * Download data - to down load the historical monthly soil moisture
       data and the daily soil moisture data of this year.
