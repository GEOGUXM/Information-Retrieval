   The U.S. Geological Survey provides the Nation with reliable, impartial
   information to describe and understand the Earth.

   This information is used to:

     * minimize loss of life and property from natural disasters;
     * manage water, biological, energy, and mineral resources;
     * enhance and protect the quality of life; and
     * contribute to wise economic and physical development.

   USGS is the Nation's largest natural-science agency and has the
   principal responsibility within the Federal government for mapping the
   Nation, assessing its geologic resources and hazards, understanding its
   natural biological resources, and providing hydrologic information for
   appraising the Nation's water resources. The Maryland-Delaware-D.C.
   District Office is mostly involved with conducting water-resources
   investigations. However, the District Chief (Baltimore) represents all
   of USGS in Maryland and D.C., and the Subdistrict Chief (Dover)
   represents USGS in Delaware.

   The water resources of Maryland, Delaware, and the District of Columbia
   consist of numerous streams, springs, lakes, and aquifer systems.
   Streamflow, ground-water levels, and water-quality data are collected
   at numerous locations, and water-use data are collected throughout the
   area. These hydrologic data and other data are used in research and
   hydrologic studies to describe the quantity, quality, and location of
   the area's water resources. The collection, analysis, and
   interpretation of these data is done in cooperation with other federal,
   state and local agencies, universities, and research centers.
