         Welcome to IRIS !

         The compact 6.4 GHz ECR ion source IRIS (Ion source for Radioactive
         ISotopes) has been developed for the production of low to medium charge
         state radioactive ion beams [references: ECRIS97, ICIS97, HIAT98,
         PAC99].

         The ion source consists of only one plasma stage. The microwave is
         launched through an off-axis wave-guide (see figure 2) terminated at a
         bias plate in the injection region. The aluminum plasma chamber has a
         diameter of 13.5 cm and the magnetic-mirror length is 28.3 cm,
         providing a relatively large plasma volume of 5 liters. The plasma
         chamber is double-walled to accommodate cooling water. The mirror field
         reaches a maximum field of 0.7 Tesla at the injection and 0.4 Tesla at
         the extraction. At the plasma chamber-wall the sextupole-field strength
         reaches 0.32 Tesla.

         The IRIS project is initially focused on the production a low energy
         14O ion beam (30 keV) to measure the energy shape of the beta decay
         spectrum. 14O is generated in the form of CO in a high temperature
         carbon target (see figure 4) using a 20 MeV ^3He+ beam from the LBNL
         88-Inch Cyclotron via the reaction 12C(3He,n)14O.(link). An 8 m
         stainless steel transfer line connects the target chamber to an ECR ion
         source through a turbo molecular pumping stage (see figure 1). Thus,
         the turbo pump separates the target vacuum chamber from the ion source.
         The gas coming from the turbo pump is fed into the ion source and
         ionized, extracted at energies of 20 to 30 keV and mass separated.
