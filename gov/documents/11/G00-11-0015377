  The Nation's water resources are the basis for life and our economic vitality.
  These resources support a complex web of human activities and fishery and
  wildlife needs that depend upon clean water. Demands for good-quality water
  for drinking, recreation, farming, and industry are rising, and as a result,
  the American public is concerned about the condition and sustainablity of our
  water resources. The American public is asking: Is it safe to swim in and
  drink water from our rivers or lakes? Can we eat the fish that come from them?
  Is our ground water polluted? Is water quality degrading with time, and if so,
  why? Has all the money we've spent to clean up our waters, done any good? The
  U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program was
  designed to provide information that will help answer these questions.

   NAWQA is designed to assess historical, current, and future
   water-quality conditions in representative river basins and aquifers
   nationwide. One of the primary objectives of the program is to describe
   relations between natural factors, human activities, and water-quality
   conditions and to define those factors that most affect water quality
   in different parts of the Nation. The linkage of water quality to
   environmental processes is of fundamental importance to water-resource
   managers, planners, and policy makers. It provides a strong and
   unbiased basis for better decisionmaking by those responsible for
   making decisions that affect our water resources, including the United
   States Congress, Federal, State, and local agencies, environmental
   groups, and industry. Information from the NAWQA Program also will be
   useful for guiding research, monitoring, and regulatory activities in
   cost effective ways.

   The NAWQA Program's unique design provides consistent and comparable
   information on water resources in 60 important river basins and
   aquifers across the Nation. Together, these areas account for 60 to 70
   percent of the Nation's water use and population served by public water
   supplies and cover about one-half of the land area of the Nation.
   Investigations of these 60 areas, referred to as study units, are the
   principal building blocks of the NAWQA Program.
