                    NOTICE from the PACER Administrator:
      The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois is
      currently a site providing federal court case information on the
    Internet. If you experience trouble accessing this site, traditional
      dial-up PACER is still available. Whether you access PACER on the
     Internet or use the dial-up service, you will be required to use a
           login and password issued by the PACER Service Center.

   If you do not already have a PACER account, apply here. It takes about
    a week to receive a login and password from the PACER Service Center.

     There is a $.07 per page charge for downloading case information on
                                this system.

   The Judiciary is always open for suggestions from our electronic public
   access users for improvements. If you have comments or questions, send
     email to the PACER Service Center at pacer@psc.uscourts.gov. Please
     include the name of the specific court you are referring to in your
                                   email.
