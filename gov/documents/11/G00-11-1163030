    IMPORTANT REMINDER
    Whether you are retired or still employed, if you are not already
    receiving Social Security benefits you must begin the process of
    signing up for Medicare Part A three months before your 65th birthday
    (you can delay the start of Part B).

                 RIGHTS OF RESERVISTS CALLED TO ACTIVE DUTY

   On November 16 we posted a fact sheet and frequently asked questions on
   FEHB coverage for Federal civilian employees called to active duty
   service. This supplments the information issued September 14 in
   Compensation Memo 2001-09. FEHB coverage is discussed in item 7 of
   Attachment 1 to that letter.

   Is there a local HMO that you would like to join but can't because they
   don't participate in the FEHB program? Ask them to consider joining the
   program, and tell them to take a look at
