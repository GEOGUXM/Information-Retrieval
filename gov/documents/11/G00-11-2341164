   Coming Soon: Seal Your Ducts! Seal and Insulate!

   Seal Your Ducts!
   Are you getting your money's worth from your furnace or air
   conditioner? Are you concerned about dust, mold, and chemicals being
   blown around your house? Are you concerned about Carbon Monoxide (CO)?
   These are all good reasons to get your ducts sealed and insulated. The
   ENERGY STAR^Â® Specification for Ducts will help remedy these problems
   as well as save you 20 percent on your heating and cooling bills. The
   pilot phase of the program is planned to end Summer 2001. For more
   information see http://www.energystar.gov/ducts.
