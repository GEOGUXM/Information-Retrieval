        This web site is provided as a service to the aerospace community.
        It contains data on major government aerospace facilities which were
        prepared by the individual installations, who are responsible for
        the content.


   The site has been taken off-line for review, and access to the site
   will be restricted in the future. Information on how to access the site
   will be posted by February 1, 2002.

   If your need is urgent, please send an email to:
   lreynold@mail.hq.nasa.gov.

        We will be updating and strengthening this inventory as users gain
        experience in using it. We welcome your suggestions and comments in
        making it more useful to you.
