   mportant documents in History

   Magna Carta
   , charter granted by King John of England to the English barons in
   1215, and considered the basis of English constitutional liberties.
   King John's military failures, his stringent taxation, and his abuse of
   privileges provoked his barons to rebellion. A group of barons drew up
   a charter, which they sent to the king for confirmation. When John
   refused, the barons captured the city of London. John met the barons at
   Runnymede on June 15 and sealed and issued the charter.(1)
   The Magna Carta contained the first detailed definition of the
   relationship between the king and the barons, guaranteed feudal rights,
   and regularized the judicial system. The charter abolished royal
   assessments without consent of the common council, protected commerce,
   set strict procedures for trials, and standardized penalties for
   felonies. The Magna Carta was the springboard for opponents of the
   royal prerogative during the parliamentary rebellion of the early 17th
   century. The charter was buttressed in 1628 by the Petition of Right
   and in 1689 by the Bill of Rights, to form the platform for
   parliamentary superiority over the Crown and to give documentary
   authority for the rule of law in England.

   Declaration of Independence
   , document proclaiming the independence of the 13 British colonies in
   America, adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. The
   declaration recounted the grievances of the colonies against the
   British crown and declared the colonies to be free and independent
   states.
   On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee, a Virginia delegate to the
   Continental Congress, moved that the colonies become free and
   independent states absolved from all allegiance to the British crown.
   This motion was seconded by John Adams of Massachusetts, but voting was
   deferred until July 1. The resolution was passed on the following day.
   In the meantime, a committee was preparing a declaration in line with
   Lee's resolution. Thomas Jefferson prepared the draft, and Adams and
   Benjamin Franklin made a number of minor changes to it before it was
   submitted to Congress. On July 4 Congress made a number of additional
   changes and submitted the document as the Declaration of Independence.
   The declaration was unanimously adopted. It is now enshrined in the
   National Archive Exhibition Hall, Washington, D.C., and is sealed in a
   glass and bronze case filled with inert helium gas.(1)

   Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen
   , manifesto adopted in 1789 by the National Assembly of France that
   formed the preamble to the new constitution of 1791. The declaration
   enumerated a number of rights with which "all men" were held to be
   endowed and nullified the divine right of kings, which was the former
   basis of French government.

   The enumerated rights included participation in the making of laws;
   equality of all before the law; equitable taxation; protection against
   loss of property through arbitrary action by the state; freedom of
   religion, speech, and the press; and protection against arbitrary
   arrest and punishment. The declaration served as a model for most of
   the declarations of political and civil rights adopted by European
   states in the 19th century. (2)

   "Yesterday, December 7, 1941 - a date which will live in infamy"
   -Proclaimed President Franklin Delano Roosevelt  to a Joint Meeting of
   Congress December 8 1941.

   CAP was just a 7 days old, had no defined missions, just a limited
   number of men and women who quickly joined, and with no cadets until
   (10-42). By cessation of hostilities on September 2, 1945...CAP now
   had  almost  125,000 members including cadets, Accomplish the
   impossible to some and done so mostly by volunteer's.   Coastal,
   Forest, Border Patrols, Tow-Target, Liaison and Courier service. Not
   only did CAP win the respect of a grateful nation and its government
   because of these accomplishment the rest they say is history.

   "On September the eleventh, (2001) enemies of freedom committed an act
   of war against our country"  Proclaimed President George W. Bush to a
   Joint Meeting of Congress September 21 2001

   CAP was now 59 years, 10 months and 12 days old when it was called upon
   to do a "wartime mission" the first since August 1945, This time we
   were ready, had the training,  the manpower, solid equipment, and

   New Release.

   Civil Air Patrol flies missions in wake of World Trade Center disaster

   MAXWELL AFB, ALA.-Late Wednesday afternoon, national media reported a
   light
   aircraft flying over the World Trade Center site. That plane belonged
   to Civil Air Patrol, who performed those flights at the request of New
   York Governor George E. Pataki. The mission was just one of dozens
   flown across the country after Tuesday's disaster at the World Trade
   Center. The flights over the World Trade Center site provided
   high-resolution digital images to the New York State Emergency
   Management Office. The photos were delivered directly to SEMO and are
   being evaluated by that agency's Graphic Information Systems.

   "Civil Air Patrol provided the first direct aerial perspective of the
   disaster site for the State of New York," says Dan O'Brien, Graphic
   Information Program Manager for State Emergency Management Operations
   center in Albany, NY. The photos comprised a visual record of the
   damage in a presentation Wednesday to heads of New York's state
   agencies. "The photos were the first images we'd seen looking down on
   the site and showed debris on top of buildings and damage to rooftops."

   The flight was authorized by FEMA Regional Command Center, based in
   Maynard, Mass., the FAA, and the U.S. Air Force and was under the
   control of local air traffic controllers. The plane completed three
   passes over the site, once at 2,000 feet and twice at 1,300 feet,
   providing a direct aerial perspective that had not been documented up
   to that point.

   Lt. Col. Jacques Heinrich, CAP, piloted the Cessna 172 while crew
   members Capts. Warren Ratis, CAP, and Andrew Feldman, CAP, documented
   the damage. For Capt. Ratis, the flight brought some personal
   reflection about his former work place. "As someone who had worked on
   the 79th floor of tower one for 10 years (which ended this past
   January), I can tell you that the loss and destruction was more than I
   thought imaginable."

   New York Civil Air Patrol members are stationed at the SEMO, on
   stand-by for further damage-assessment flights.

    First Hand actual accounts of events on September 12, 2001 "Debrief"

   To: LTC. ALLAN F POGORZELSKI, CAP Historian
   Dear Sir,
   Wednesday about 11:30 AM , I was called by Capt. Ratis and Capt Feldman
   for a photo mission over the WTC. I was asked if I could make myself
   available to fly this mission. My superior at work understood, cleared
   all appointments I had scheduled for the remainder of the day.
   I work as Building Inspector for the Inc. Village of Lake Grove, NY.
   However, my job description also includes plans review, issuing
   building permits, inspecting various jobs, both commercial and
   residential .
   By 12:15 I was at Islip Airport. The Long Island Group Headquarters.
   Obtaining all necessary clearances was a monumental job. For this task
   I asked Major John Paeper to help us out. Major Paeper is extremely
   experienced with working the FAA system. He was a flight controller as
   well as a supervisor for over 40 years. He handled all phone calls to
   the different agencies, both the military, the State and the CAP
   mission base in Alb.
   Around 4:30 finally we got the go ahead for the flight. Of course we
   filed IFR.To make certain we were handled by TRACON. We were cleared
   direct: Long Island Three departure, radar vector direct JFK , direct
   WTC. Climbed to and maintain 2000 feet. Once at altitude the silence
   was eerie, I have been flying in this airspace for over 25 years and I
   have never experienced this type of silence. As a matter of fact, I
   think we were the only airplane aloft. Flying directly over JFK and
   seeing the airplanes from all over the world parked on taxi ways on the
   runways was a sight. Not a single one of them moving was even more
   eerie. I have never flown in class B airspace and experience this type
   silence.
   Once we got closer toward our target, the smoke increased dramatically,
   as well as the smell of the smoke. Over the WTC, I reduced the speed of
   the aircraft so that both Capt. Ratis and Capt Feldman could take
   pictures with the window open. Unfortunately, THE NYPD did not like us
   in the area, however, we managed to make 2 and half orbits over the
   site. The first orbit was made at 2000 feet, thereafter I dropped down
   to 1000 feet. Capt Ratis and Capt Feldman would do much better in
   describing this awfully horrendous disaster. My job was to fly,
   maintain altitude and attitude and keep alert. Flying over Manhattan is
   a bit different than flying over flat terrain. The heat updrafts and
   turbulence created from the heat were of paramount concern to me. As
   PIC safety and well being of the crew is my responsibility. Each time
   we flew through the smoke,( 3X) we were momentarily blinded and teary
   eyed.
   Again, please call on the two members with me for their commentary.
   I must say this. As a young man of 7 and 8 years old, I experienced
   this type of carnage and disaster during World War Two. I was born in
   Alsace, France. Near the city of Strasbourg Seeing all this again,
   brought back so many memories. However, that was war. What do we call
   this?
   To answer some of your questions.
   Yes all three of us live on Long Island, in the county of Suffolk. I
   would guess that Newsday is our paper.
   I would have to ask Capt. Ratis to provide you with the pictures.
   Sincerely,
   Jacques J. Heinrich, LTC, CAP
   Standardization and Evaluation Officer
   Long Island Group

                               dé-jà vu - II

   Then
       Franklin Delano Roosevelt (B1882-D1945) the 32nd President of the
   United States (1933-1945) established America’s Civil Defense
   Organization as the office of Civilian Defense pursuant to Executive
   Order No. 8758 on May 20, 1941. Governor of New York (1929-1932).To
   this task FDR in 1941 appointed an outstanding organizer and leaderNew
   York City Mayor Fiorello "Henry" LaGuardia (B1882-D1947) in naming him
   as director of the Office of Civilian Defense.

   Now
       George Walker Bush (B1946) the 43rd President of the United States
   (2001-) established America’s Homeland Security, a cabinet level
   position on 11 September 2001.To this task GWB appointed Pennsylvania
   Governor Tom Ridge (B1945) as the first director of homeland security
   on 8^th October 2001. Note: a position the country's leaders never felt
   was needed before Sept. 11 2001.

                              [frontNYNEWS.jpg]

   To many who know me and  more so  heard me speak, Yes I'm a New
   Yorker..... born and raised in the City (Borough of Brooklyn) and
   joined CAP as a cadet and  later became a Senior in New York City....
   That faithful eleventh day of September in the year of two thousand and
   one is etched in my mind forever. An event that not only change my view
   from my balcony and  window ... But has brought to me in many ways the
   senselessness' of this act of terror and has  changed how we go about
   our daily lives. Yes the two majestic towers of steel, concrete and
   glass of the World Trade Centers are gone from my view, a view I
   enjoyed for over 30 years ...Usually before I headed out for the day,
   and with a cup of coffee in hand ... I would go out on to my balcony
   and take in the view of "the greatest city in the world". Now that view
   has change.. The impact that it is gone ..... has hit home.. even
   more so are ... people I knew  that worked at the WTC gone.......And
   gone also  are some of New York's Bravest & Finest  true heroes and I
   hope not  ever to be forgotten...They the "Band of Brothers & Sisters"
   a meager force of 300 plus gave the ultimate sacrifice to save over
   20,000 plus people in the towers.... Then the news  that a friend was
   lost in the Pentagon.........9/11  a date that has changed the thinking
   of this magnificent City but not the spirit...........Thanks
   ........Cyd........for sending me this ...
