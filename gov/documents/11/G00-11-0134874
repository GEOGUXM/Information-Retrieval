   Welcome to the Western Administrative Support Center's (WASC) web site.
   Our offices are located at NOAA's Western Regional Center (WRC) in
   Seattle, WA. We are one of four Administrative Support Centers in the
   Department of Commerce (DoC) that provide a comprehensive suite of
   administrative support services to designated DoC and NOAA offices.

   Our site is organized into three main sections to help you get right to
   the information you need.

   About Us - This is a good introduction to WASC - who we are and what we
   do. Look here for information on our: Mission, Services, Service
   Region, and Customers. You will also find visitor information such as
   directions and maps here.

   Customer Services - This is the heart of WASC. If you work for DoC or a
   NOAA office within the WASC service region, you'll find what you're
   looking for here. Services are divided into the following areas:

   Facilities and Logistics
   Financial Management
   Human Resources
   Information Technology
   Western Region Security

   WASC Internal - This section is designed for WASC employees. You will
   find information and services you may need on a daily basis in this
   section. It includes: WASC policies, programs, and goals plus other
   local and regional items of general interest.
