   About ToxFAQs혲

   The ATSDR ToxFAQs^TM  is a series of summaries about hazardous
   substances developed by the ATSDR Division of Toxicology.  Information
   for this series is excerpted from the ATSDR Toxicological Profiles and
   Public Health Statements. Each fact sheet serves as a quick and easy to
   understand guide. Answers are provided to the most frequently asked
   questions (FAQs) about exposure to hazardous substances found around
   hazardous waste sites and the effects of exposure on human health.

   Each ToxFAQs^TM is available in both the standard HTML format below or
   in the PDF format which provides the familiar two page print version
   widely used at community meetings and distributed via our mailing
   list.  This PDF format requires Adobe Acrobat Reader, which can be
   downloaded free from the Adobe  Exiting the ATSDR Web Site.   web
   site.

   Where can I get more information?

   You can get further information on our web site about all the ATSDR
   Toxiclogical Profiles and how they are developed.  You can also get a
   longer version of these ToxFAQs , called the Public Health Statements,
   from the Public Health Statements home page as well as from each of the
   ToxFAQs links below.

   What else can ATSDR do?

   ATSDR can tell you where to find occupational and environmental health
   clinics. Specialists in these clinics can recognize, evaluate, and
   treat illnesses resulting from exposure to hazardous substances. You
   can also contact your community or state health or environmental
   quality department if you have any more questions or concerns.

     Molecular Models

   PCB Molecule.

   Molecular models are included in the ToxFAQs^TM in two formats: a GIF
   image, usually a stereo GIF image, and an MDL Molfile (3D viewer) file.
   The stereo GIF images were produced with the RasMol molecular modelling
   software and are viewed by slightly crossing your eyes to produce a
   stereoscopic 3D image. The 3D viewer file is intended to be viewed with
   the MDL Chemscape CHIME Plug-In software, but can be also viewed with
   any molecular modelling software that accepts the MDL Molfile format
   such as RasMol.

   NFPA 704 Label Information

   NFPA Label

   When available for a specific substance, National Fire Protection
   Agency (NFPA) 704 Chemical Hazard Labels are included in the ToxFAQ^TM
   sheets. These labels are a standard way of quickly identifying the
   health, flammability, and reactivity hazards associated with specific
   chemicals.

   Chemfinder and MSDS Links

   ChemFinder

   Also included in each ToxFAQ^TM sheet is a link to CambridgeSoft
   ChemFinder. You are required to register for ChemFinder, but the
   service is free and contains more information about specific chemical
   substances as well as many links to other Web sites with even more
   information. In addition, a link to a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)
   archive will be included when one exists for a specific compound.
