What is Intelligence?

   This question is not easy to answer and, depending on who you ask, you
   may get different answers. But most people agree that intelligence is
   information needed by our nation's leaders, also known as policy
   makers, to keep our country safe.

    Policy makers, like the President, do not have time to read all the
   other countries' newspapers . . . there are just too many of them.
   Also, there is information that other countries will not share with the
   United States, called secrets. All this information is very important
   to our nation's leaders.

   The intelligence puzzle begins when the President, National Security
   Council or Cabinet members have questions that need answering. Just as
   there are different types and sizes of puzzles, there are different
   categories of intelligence:
   -- Current Intelligence looks at day-to-day events.
       -- Estimative Intelligence looks at what might be or what might
       happen.
       -- Warning Intelligence gives notice to our policy makers that
       something urgent might happen that may require their immediate
       attention.
       -- Research Intelligence is an in-depth study of an issue.
       -- Scientific and technical intelligence is information on foreign
       technologies.

   Once a question is asked and we determine what type of "puzzle" it is,
   we then set out to solve it for the policy maker. The answers to these
   questions are intelligence. Index
