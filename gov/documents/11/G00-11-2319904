   Historical Course Data A unit of the California Resources Agency,
   Department of Water Resources, Division of Flood Management.

   Section 228 of the Water Code mandates that the Department collect
   snowpack, rainfall, and river discharge data, in order to forecast
   seasonal river runoff volume. This forecast is officially published in
   DWR's Bulletin 120. The data used in producing the water supply
   forecasts are provided by public and private cooperating agencies. The
   State has coordinated Snow Surveys since 1930, and we have been
   publishing our water supply forecasts on the World-wide Web since early
   1994.

   Hydrologic data are maintained by our sister section the California
   Data Exchange Center.

   The 2001 Meeting of the Western Snow Conference will be held April
   16-19, 2001 at Sun Valley, Idaho.
