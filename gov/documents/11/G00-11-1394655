            The Western Human Nutrition Research Center is one of six
   USDA-funded human nutrition centers in the country. Located on the
   University of California, Davis, campus, the goal of  the Center is to
   define nutrition interventions that promote good health. The Center is
   currently accepting volunteers for the following studies:

   PREGNANT WOMEN NEEDED FOR IRON AND ZINC NUTRITION STUDY
   Are you a healthy, pregnant woman in your first trimester? Are you
       planning to become pregnant soon?  If so, you may be a candidate
       for our study that is looking at the effects of iron
       supplementation on zinc nutrition. Click here for details.

   SELENIUM STUDY:  SELENIUM: A FINE LINE BETWEEN BENEFIT AND HARM
   Have you ever heard of selenium?  Did you know that you consume it
       every day, probably without even knowing it?  Now selenium is
       available as a supplement from health food stores, and people are
       racing to take it, before all of the facts on this mysterious
       mineral are in.  Click here for more details.

   SPINAL CORD INJURED VOLUNTEERS NEEDED FOR NUTRITION STUDY
   Vitamins A, E, C, D, and beta-carotene are important nutrients that may
       protect people against many cancers, heart disease and degenerative
       diseases. Scientists at the Department of Nutrition, University of
       California Davis and the USDA Western Human Nutrition Research
       Center are interested in investigating the intake and serum
       concentrations of nutrients in healthy people with spinal cord
       injury. We hope to learn whether people with spinal cord injury are
       at risk for poor nutrition and to use the information from this
       study to devise more appropriate nutritional advvice for people
       with severe disabilities. To be eligible for this study, you should
       be a healthy man or woman 18 65 years old with stabilized
       paraplegia or quadriplegia for more than 2 years. You will be paid
       $50 for completing this study and will receive information on your
       nutrient status. If you might be interested in participating in
       this study, please contact: Mindy Dopler-Nelson at 530-752-5177,
       and press #3.
