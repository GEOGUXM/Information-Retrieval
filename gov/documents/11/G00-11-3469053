                            Allen V. Astin Award
                                    2001
                       Presented to Thomas R. Scott on
         December 5, 2001 in Gaithersburg, MD, for his leadership of
                      the Sources and Detectors Group.
                                [scott1.jpg]
        This award recognizes his "achievement in the advancement of
       measurement science and the delivery of measurement services."

                        Cryogenic Radiometer Comparison

    Staff of the Optoelectronics Division and the Optical Technology
    Division have completed a careful comparison of cryogenic radiometers
    that each Division uses as a primary standard for certain types of
    radiometric measurements. Agreement was obtained to between 0.04% and
    0.07% (expanded uncertainty, k=2) for different parameters. Complete
    results will be published in the NIST Journal of Research, later this
    year.

                      New SRM for Wavelength Calibrations

    A new Standard Reference Material, SRM 2517a, will provide higher
    accuracy wavelength scale and linearity calibrations in the 1510-1540
    nm region, for wavelength division multiplexed optical communications
    systems. The center wavelengths of 56 absorption lines in acetylene (
    ^12C[2]H[2]) are certified, most of them to an expanded uncertainty
    (k=2) of either 0.1 nm or 0.3 nm.
