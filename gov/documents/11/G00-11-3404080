   Sanctuary Ocean Count volunteers at the Kualoa site spot a blow on the
   surface.
   The goal of the Sanctuary Ocean Count is to record the number of
   humpback whales sighted from various shore sites around the islands in
   a four-hour period. Not only has this proven to be a fun volunteer
   activity for residents and visitors, but it also helps to provide
   important population and distribution information on humpback whales
   around the Hawaiian Islands.

   2002 will mark the Sanctuary Ocean Count's sixth year on O`ahu, the
   fourth year on the Big Island, and the third year on Kaua`i. The Great
   Whale Count on Maui is conducted independently by the Pacific Whale
   Foundation.

   Many changes have been made for this year's event. Rather than our
   one-day count, we will be holding counts on the last Saturday in
   January, February and March. Increasing the counts will not only help
   to alleviate the crowding at some of the sites, but it will also
   provide the Sanctuary with some important information regarding
   humpback whale distribution over the course of the whale season. In
   addition to these new dates, the count will begin at 8:00 am, to
   accommodate the request of many volunteers who have witnessed
   substantial whale activity earlier in the day.

                                              [diamondheadvolunteers.jpg]

                Volunteers turn out in full force at Diamond Head lookout.

   Both site leaders and general volunteers are being sought for all
   islands. Site leaders will be responsible for serving as the point of
   contact for the volunteers at their site, coordinating the data
   collection of whale sightings, and handling any media inquiries at
   their site. Because site leaders are an essential part of the count,
   they will be required to participate on all three days and attend a
   training session on data collection procedures. For their efforts,they
   will receive a free Sanctuary Ocean Count t-shirt.

   Of course, the count cannot be done without the help of enthusiastic
   volunteers. For the 2001 count, we were impressed with the overwhelming
   response of dedicated residents and visitors who turned out to support
   the event. Over 1000 volunteers participated in the three-island count.
   If you are interested in joining us for a morning of whale watching,
   either as a general volunteer or site leader, please call our offices
   to register. Calls for the Big Island count will be taken at our O`ahu
   office through a toll-free number.


                               O`AHU: 397-2656

                              KAUA`I: 246-2860

                         BIG ISLAND: 1-888-55-WHALE


   As always, we are encouraged by the growing number of enthusiastic
   volunteers for the Sanctuary Ocean Count and we look forward to seeing
   you out there!
