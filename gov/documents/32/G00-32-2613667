   The Scientific Library  houses a Microcomputer Lab for hands-on
   training purposes. The facility seats up to 10 people and is used
   primarily by Library staff to teach scheduled training classes for
   NCI-Frederick employees. For descriptions of these classes, please see
   Library Classes.

   Software and other training classes scheduled by programs outside the
   Library are also held in the Microcomputer Lab. The Library staff
   welcomes your inquiries into using the Microcomputer Lab for your
   specific training needs. Please contact the Instructional Resources
   Librarian if you are interested in scheduling a program in the
   Microcomputer Lab.  The Microcomputer Lab Policy provides important
   information for potential users.
