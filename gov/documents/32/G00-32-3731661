                      Where Is Comet Wild-2 Right Now?

     The images below are all SIMULATED views of Comet Wild-2 using the
     comet's latest orbital elements. All of the images are computer
     generated and are automatically updated every 10 minutes. The top
     two images shows the comet's orbits, and the bottom two images shows
     the comet's view of Earth and Jupiter.

                Comet Wild-2's Orbit, Looking Down on the Sun

   In this view, Comet Wild-2 moving in a counterclockwise direction
   towards the orbit of Jupiter. The comet was discovered in 1978 by Paul
   Wild, and he STARDUST spacecraft will encounter Comet Wild-2 in the
   year 2004. [image2a.jpg]

                 Comet Wild-2's Orbit, Centered On The Comet

   Passing through Comet Wild's coma, STARDUST will collect cometary
   material and return them to Earth in the year 2006.

   In January 2001, the STARDUST spacecraft will make an Earth flyby for a
   gravity assist to help it reach Comet Wild-2's orbit. The comet itself
   does not get particulary close to Earth. The comet's perihelion point
   (the closest distance to the Sun) is just inside of the orbit of Mars.

                       Comet Wild-2's View of Jupiter

   Prior to 1974, Comet Wild-2 was a distant comet whose orbit was between
   the orbits of Jupiter and Uranus. In 1974, Comet Wild-2 made a very
   close flyby of Jupiter (only 0.006 AU), which significently altered the
   comet's orbit into its present day orbit. Comet Wild-2 currently
   crosses the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Jupiter will no doubt continue
   to have a major influence on Comet Wild-2 in the future.
