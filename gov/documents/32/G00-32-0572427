     Check on the status of a license You can check on the status of a
     dental auxiliary license by clicking here.

     Keep in mind that each dental auxiliary licensee is only allowed to
     perform certain duties, which you can review by clicking here.

     Once you have located the individual record for an auxiliary, you
     can also determine what additional duties they are allowed to
     perform.

     For a Registered Dental Assistant, the "License and Registration
     Class" will show the designation "COR" if they are only allowed to
     perform coronal polishing, "ULT" if they are allowed to perform
     ultrasonic scaling for orthodontic procedures, and "CU" if they are
     allowed to perform both duties.

     For a Registered Dental Hygienest, the "License and Registration
     Class" will show the designation "S" if they are allowed to perform
     soft tissue curettage, "L" if they are allowed to perform local
     anesthesia, and "N" if they are allowed to administer nitrous oxide
     and oxygen. The field will either be completely blank or show the
     designation "SLN" if they are allowed to perform all three duties.
     The field will show the designation "NON" if they are not allowed to
     perform any of the three duties.
