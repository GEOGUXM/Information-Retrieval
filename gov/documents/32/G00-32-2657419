     FrogWeb: Amphibian Declines


     The Problem:

   Class Amphibia - frogs and toads, newts and salamanders, and caecilians
   - first appeared on Earth during the Devonian Period (360 to 408
   million years ago). While many amphibian species have evolved and gone
   extinct over the millenia, more than 5000 species exist today. Various
   amphibians have adapted over this expanse of time to occupy different
   habitats, including wetlands, forests, deserts, prairies, and savannas.
   By the time human civilizations were established, amphibians were
   present in all but the most inhospitable of regions. Until recently,
   whether you lived in a city, a suburb, or a rural area anywhere in the
   world, chances are you weren't too far away from a frog, toad,
   salamander, or caecilian.

   So what has changed? In short, the number of amphibians out there.

   Amphibian populations are in decline in many areas of the world. In
   cities and the countryside, in rainforests and wetlands, countless
   areas which previously hosted a range of healthy amphibian populations
   now have fewer - and even no - frogs, toads, and salamanders. While
   healthy populations of some species may exist elsewhere in some cases
   of declines, a few species - including Costa Rica's Monteverde golden
   toad and Australia's Gastric brooding frog - are now believed extinct.

   What's causing these mysterious declines? Scientists conducting field
   research have produced compelling evidence for habitat loss, climate
   change, UV radiation, contaminants and pollutants, disease, and
   predation by invasive species as possible causes. Even more baffling,
   amphibian declines are not necessarily occurring in "likely" places
   where human impacts are obvious, such as cities and suburbs prone to
   development and pollution; indeed, some of the most noted and dramatic
   declines are happening in "protected" areas such as national parks.

   The scientific community now suspects that there is no one reason for
   worldwide declines of amphibians. For example, diseases or pollutants
   that have decimated a species in one part of the world may be
   completely absent in another region that has also experienced a
   mysterious die-off of its amphibians. In some cases, die-offs can be
   attributed to a specific cause; in others, the cause is not so obvious.
   Many researchers believe that multiple, additive causes - for instance,
   a high incidence of UV radiation combined with the presence of a
   disease - may be at the heart of large numbers of worldwide declines.

   As research continues into amphibian declines phenomena, FrogWeb will
   make available the latest findings, which can be accessed from the
