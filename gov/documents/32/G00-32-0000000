Official Bio - Russell Knight

   Russell Knight joined us from GTE Corporation, where he worked on a
   variety of projects, including software systems for automatic system
   configuration, intelligent inventorying, request fulfillment, and
   restocking. Russell has significant experience in both hands-on
   software development and technical leadership of software design and
   development tasks. Russell holds a B.S. in Computer Science from the
   University of Maryland, an M.S. in Computer Science from the University
   of California, Los Angeles, and is currently a Ph.D. student in the
   Computer Science Department at the University of California, Los
   Angeles (Advisor: Richard Korf). He is currently working on the
   Automated Scheduing and Planning Environment(ASPEN) planning system for
   mission operations, the Continuous Activity Scheduling, Planning,
   Execution, and Replanning (CASPER) real-time planning system, and the
   Mission Data System (MDS) (specifically the scheduler). Additionally,
   he supports research efforts in Antarctica.
   His research interests are in planning and scheduling, heuristic
   search, operations research, and space exploration automation.
