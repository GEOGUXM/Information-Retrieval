Digital Raster Graphic (DRG)


   A Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) is a digital image (scanned version) of
   a USGS topographic map. DRGs are produced from USGS 1:24,000-,
   1:24,000/1:25,000-, 1:63,360- (Alaska), 1:100,000-, and 1:250,000-scale
   topographic map series. The image inside the map neatline is
   georeferenced to the surface of the Earth and fit to the Universal
   Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. The horizontal positional
   accuracy and datum of the DRG matches the accuracy and datum of the
   source map.

   DRGs for Lake Tahoe are available here as TIFF and MrSID images of USGS
   7.5-minute topographic maps, along with its associated world file in
   text. The world file can be used by some software to place the DRGs in
   digital space. DRGs in MrSID format can be viewed with MrSID viewers
   from footer image. LizardTech, which are available for free from their
   website.

   DRG of Basin Lake Tahoe.

   DRGs are in UTM NAD27 zone 10 projection. Raw (original) data are in
   the following projections: data east of 120 degrees longitude are in
   UTM zone 11 and data west of 120 degrees longitude are in UTM zone 10.
   It is not possible to combine different projections in Geographic
   Information System (GIS), therefore, all data have been reprojected
   into one standard projection, UTM NAD27 zone 10 projection, for the
   Lake Tahoe Basin.

   The following DRG data have been mosaicked together from the 18
   7.5-minute quadrangles which cover the Lake Tahoe Basin. The mosaicked
   files are more convenient for looking at areas throughout the basin or
   areas on the edge of two quadrangles. The mosaic is a very large file
   and has been compressed in two versions: TIFF and MrSID. These two
   files are available with its associated world files.

   DRG mosaic of the Lake Tahoe Basin:

     DRG GeoTIFF, tif and tfw files
     (82 MB compressed).

     DRG MrSID, sid and sdw files
     (57 MB compressed).
