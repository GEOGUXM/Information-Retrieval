   DIVISION OF BANKS

      The Division of Banks (DOB) was organized in 1907 and administers Title
      30, Title 32, and Title 33 of the Revised Code of Washington. The
      division regulates more than 90 Washington State-chartered commercial
      banks, stock savings banks, mutual savings banks, alien banks, savings
      and loan associations, and independent trust companies.  We charter new
      Banks, Trust Companies, Foreign Banks, and Savings & Loan Associations;
      authorize new Branches and Branch Closures; and approve Mergers &
      Acquisitions

      We work directly with the institutions we regulate through examination
      and supervisory activity to be sure that they provide adequate and
      proper services to the public. We seek to ensure the protection of the
      interests of depositors, borrowers, shareholders, and consumers.

      Our mission is to support economic stability and growth in the State of
      Washington through efficient regulation and by providing an open market
      for competitiveness of state-chartered and multi-state financial
      institutions.

      There are more than 20 federally chartered commercial banks and savings
      and loan associations with home offices in the State of Washington.
      They can be identified by the words "National" or "Federal" in their
      name, the initials "FSB" or "FA" in their name, or the initials "NA"
      following their name. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or
      the Office of Thrift Supervision regulates federally chartered
      institutions. Questions concerning these institutions can be forwarded
      to the banks themselves, or to the Office of the Comptroller of
      Currency at (800) 613-6743 or the Office of Thrift Supervision at (800)
      842-6929.

      The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures deposits of all
      commercial banks, stock savings banks, mutual savings banks, and
      savings and loan associations.
