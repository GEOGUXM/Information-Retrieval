                     An interactive television broadcast

               Advanced Consequence Assessment Decision-Making
                             (Course #ECA-400D)
                          Tuesday, October 16, 2001
                      12 noon-4 PM EDT (10 AM-2 PM MDT)

     Because there are no breaks for lunch, consider bringing a sack lunch
                              to the classroom.

      What you'll learn
      Using scenarios that represent a range of radioactive and
      non-radioactive hazardous materials releases, this four-hour
      interactive television (ITV) broadcast shows how consequence assessment
      results are used in making operational-event-classification decisions
      for onsite protective action and in recommending offsite protective
      action.

      Who will benefit
      This course has two primary DOE and DOE-contractor audiences:

        * Emergency Response Organization members, who will use consequence
          assessment results and products to make operational decisions about
          event classification, onsite protective actions, and offsite
          protective action recommendations.
        * Consequence assessors, who will develop products and
          recommendations for the decision-makers to use in making the
          operational decisions specified above.

      Course objectives
      Upon successful completion of this course, attendees will be able to do
      the following:

        * Describe the role of consequence assessment in making event
          classification and protective action decisions.
        * Describe the results and products generated by a consequence
          assessment team for use in making event classification and
          protective action decisions.
        * Explain how to use consequence assessment results and protective
          action criteria to classify an event.
        * Explain how to use consequence assessment results and protective
          action criteria to develop onsite protective actions and offsite
          protective action recommendations.
        * Explain how to consider uncertainties and conservatisms in
          consequence assessment results and protective action criteria when
          developing properly conservative event classifications and
          protective action recommendations.
        * Identify non-consequence-related conditions that might influence
          event classification and protective action decisions.
        * Apply the methods learned to develop event classifications and
          protective actions for selected emergency scenarios.

      Prerequisites
      Attendees must have a strong working knowledge of the background,
      processes, methods, and products of consequence assessment. They may
      meet this requirement through their level of experience; through
      participation in the ITV course ECA-100D, "Consequence Assessment
      Overview"; or through successful completion of the classroom course
      ECA-110, "Consequence Assessment Applications."
