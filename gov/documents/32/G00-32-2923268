                  INEEL Hybrid/Electric Vehicle Laboratory

   The Hybrid/Electric Vehicle Laboratory (HEVL) at the INEEL was
   established by the Department of Energy in 1984. Since that time,
   powertrain and vehicle testing programs which integrate advanced
   electric vehicle drive systems and test them on the track, road, and
   dynamometer have been the mainstay of this activity.


   The close integration of test programs with the INEEL Energy Storage
   Technologies Laboratory provides INEEL with the unique and valuable
   capability to perform complete tests and evaluations of all aspects of
   electric and hybrid vehicles and their subsystems.
