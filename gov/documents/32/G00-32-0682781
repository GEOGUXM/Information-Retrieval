   Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife

   Date: January 28, 2002
   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

   Razor clam dig cleared to begin Tuesday

   OLYMPIA - A four-day razor clam dig scheduled to start Tuesday, Jan. 29
   received final approval today from the Washington Department of Fish
   and Wildlife (WDFW) after a review of test results that indicate the
   clams are safe to eat.

   Digging will be allowed on four ocean beaches Jan. 29 through Feb. 1
   from noon until 11:59 p.m. each day. Beaches opening those days are
   Long Beach, Twin Harbors, Copalis and Kalaloch.

   Plans to open the four beaches for a weekday dig were announced in
   early January, but final approval had to wait for an analysis of marine
   toxin tests conducted by the state Department of Health, said Dan
   Ayres, WDFW razor clam biologist.

   "We try to give diggers as much advanced notice about openings as
   possible, but the tides were such that test results weren't available
   until today," Ayres said. "I know a lot of people have been waiting for
   this news."

   Ayres emphasized that the Mocrocks will not open for recreational
   digging this week, due to a scheduled dig by members of the Quinault
   Indian Nation. While tribal diggers will be present on the beach,
   non-tribal diggers should be aware that digging this week at Mocrocks
   is open only to members of the Quinault Indian Nation, Ayres said.

   Recreational digging will be allowed this week at Kalaloch beach, where
   harvest opportunities were restricted throughout the fall season due to
   a high abundance of small clams.

   "The clams have been growing and many have now reached desirable size,"
   Ayres said. "However, harvesters should be aware that future digging
   opportunities at Kalaloch could be compromised if wastage of small
   clams becomes an issue."

   Another razor clam opening has been tentatively scheduled Feb. 27
   through March 2 (Wednesday through Saturday), with digging allowed each
   day from noon until 11:59 p.m. at Long Beach, Copalis, Mocrocks and
   Kalaloch. Final approval of those digs is contingent on an analysis of
   marine toxin tests, conducted several days prior to the scheduled
   openings.

   Ayres noted that Kalaloch was added to the original list of scheduled
   openings under an agreement with the Olympic National Park, which owns
   the beach. However, Twin Harbors will not open during the dig planned
   Feb. 27 through March 2, because the beach has fewer clams remaining
   under its total allowable catch, he said.

   "We want to save some clams at Twin Harbors for harvest opportunities
   in the spring," Ayres said.

   Ayres reminds prospective clam diggers that they must have a valid
   shellfish/seaweed license, combination license or two-day license to
   harvest shellfish. For licensing information, see the WDFW Fishing in
   Washington pamphlet, which is also available online at
   http://www.wa.gov/wdfw/lic/licinf.htm#fishing

   Under WDFW rules, harvesters may take no more than 15 razor clams and
   must keep the first 15 taken, regardless of size or condition. Each
   digger's limit must be kept in a separate container.
