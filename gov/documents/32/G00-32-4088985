     The Ocean Principals Group, consisting of senior representatives
     from all civilian and military agencies with ocean-related
     activities, manages the Federal role in the Year of the Ocean. It
     has also made possible a national Year of the Ocean effort through
     establishment of a joint project agreement with the Heinz Center for
     Science, Economics and the Environment. This agreement provides a
     mechanism for coordination among "stakeholders" from government,
     private industry, non-government organizations, and the academic
     sector.

     The Ocean Principals Group has identified seven themes-- Maritime
     Transportation, National Security, Ocean Resources, Marine
     Environmental Quality, Recreation and Tourism, and Weather, Climate
     and Natural Hazards-- and four cross-cutting issues-- science,
     technology, and research; Legal Framework, Management of Ocean
     Areas, Uses and Resource; and Education and Exploration.
     Stakeholders will be engaged in an examination of these themes and
     issues and in the development of an agenda to take advantage of the
     opportunities for action that the Year of the Ocean provides.
