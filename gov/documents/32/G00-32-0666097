  Introduction

    Background

     NASA is experiencing a time of dynamic change. Created to challenge
     the known limits of science and engineering, NASA led many of the
     technological changes that shape our society today. Being part of
     this great technological revolution of the late twentieth century,
     we are aware that technology is not the only thing that is changing.

     Over the past several years NASA has experienced dramatic social and
     economic shifts that have radically altered the way we do business.
     These shifts require us to constantly challenge our assumptions
     about what knowledge, skills and abilities are required to manage
     the agency. This changing environment makes professional development
     planning increasingly difficult.

    The Professional Development Guide

     This guide is intended to help managers and employees prepare for
     the future by capturing the knowledge and skills that made NASA a
     success. Hundreds of employees contributed their time and energy to
     the studies included in this guide, and we are grateful for their
     support.

     Although professional development programs have been implemented at
     the center level, this program is designed to provide an
     Agency-level context within the strategic objectives of NASA for
     seven disciplines including:
     * Project Management
     * Secretarial/Clerical
     * Engineering (under development)
     * Safety, Reliability, Maintainability and Quality Assurance (under
       development)
     * Human Resources Development
     * Procurement
     * Program Control

     Specifically these research studies resulted in four products for
     each discipline:
    1. Typical career paths of existing professionals in each discipline.
    2. Recommendations for and sequencing of key job positions and
       experiences for developing individuals within and between
       disciplines.
    3. Requirements such as knowledge, skills, abilities, experiences, and
       other characteristics necessary for effective performance at the
       different discipline levels.
    4. Training and developmental experiences that are useful for
       individuals in each discipline during different phases of their
       careers.

    Common Basic Skills

     Each section describes the knowledge, skills and abilities NASA
     leaders have found contributed to their success. In addition to
     these professional specifics, the future will require every employee
     at NASA to have three basic skills, regardless of their position.

    1. Flexibility: All futures are uncertain, that's what makes them so
       exciting, and so frightening. In the past, change was more gradual
       and somewhat predictable. We had time to adjust. If we really did
       not like the change we could sometimes dodge it fairly effectively.
       Not any more. Change is inevitable and accelerating all the time.
       Employees who resist change now are finding it impossible to stay
       productive and achieve results.
       For employees to be effective they need to be flexible and
       adaptable. They need to ensure that they have a broad range of
       skills that will allow them to adjust to changing situations.
       Employees will also need to develop a greater ability to work with
       ambiguity and incomplete direction, as the accelerated changes will
       not always allow time for work to be clearly defined.
    2. Computer Skills: Once reserved for scientific calculations and word
       processing the computer has become a key tool in managing all of
       the agency's work. Internet is making it possible to stay in closer
       touch with our international partners; e-mail has stimulated
       electronic networking and eliminated the need for many face-to-face
       meetings; and expanded software has automated hundreds of jobs
       throughout the agency.
       Employees need to be knowledgeable and proficient in the use of
       computers in order to stay informed about the agency and to operate
       as efficiently and effectively as possible. As budget cuts reduce
       staff, NASA will become more dependent on automation to continue to
       meet its mission.
    3. Communication Skills: As the number of agency employees decreases,
       the hierarchy historically relied upon to transmit information and
       provide the structure we use to get our jobs done, will become less
       central. Employee at all levels will now need to convey information
       and negotiate with others to get cooperation and support . With
       organizational boundaries reduced, work will be done through teams
       and partnerships and in many cases it will be non-management
       employees who will be responsible for building the relationships
       that cause the work to get done.

    Updates to the Professional Development Guide

     Professional development studies have been planned for all major
     disciplines at NASA. This is not meant to exclude "less than major"
     disciplines which can be just as crucial to the success of the NASA
     missions. It only indicates the priority which prevails in the
     process. More information is being gathered and will be provided as
     updates to this Guide.

  1.0 Professional Development Philosophy

     Employees' professional development is a shared responsibility. In
     order to design a successful career each employee needs to take
     personal responsibility to create a plan and initiate actions that
     will lead them to their goal. NASA and the nation benefit when all
     employees are able to develop their potential and make greater
     contributions. To optimize current and future employee
     contributions, supervisors and managers must be actively involved
     with their employees in developing their career plan. This
     involvement includes periodic assessments of each employee's
     knowledge, skill, ability, and experience. This assessment then
     leads to developmental planning for work assignments and training
     that promote NASA and the employee's goals.

     Professional development for an individual will contribute to
     improved performance. The purpose of professional development is to
     enhance current performance and enable individuals to take advantage
     of future opportunities. Professional development cannot be directly
     associated with a promotion or increased pay.

     Senior managers and subject matter experts in each professional
     discipline will guide and shape the scope and content of
     professional development for that discipline. Managers and subject
     matter experts are especially qualified to determine the knowledge,
     skills, abilities, and experiences required for success at each
     stage of an individual's professional growth. These managers and
     experts are also well positioned to anticipate changing work force
     requirements and associated development needs.

     Personnel in similar disciplines will share tools and approaches and
     be "universally assignable" across the Agency. Common tools and
     approaches will improve efficiency, decrease turnaround times,
     reduce down time, improve customer service and cut cost. For
     example, NASA should be able to expect project managers to
     understand and have experienced the same tools and language at their
     installation as they would if they were to work on a similar project
     in another installation.

     Information concerning professional development processes will be
     available to all employees. Information provided to NASA employees
     is available to help them identify options and develop plans to
     realize their professional development goals.

     Employees should anticipate what is required to develop in their
     current development paths or to bridge to different ones. Employees
     will have access to professional development path information to
     assist them in understanding the knowledge, skills, abilities, and
     experiences required to advance within or between disciplines.

  2.0 Individual, Management and Organization Responsibilities

     Employees must:
     * Determine what they want their career to be.
     * Assess their aptitudes strengths, and development needs with their
       supervisor.
     * Work with their supervisor to develop an Individual Development
       Plan (IDP) that supports both the current job and longer term
       professional goals.
     * Work with their supervisors to schedule appropriate on-the-job
       training, required complementary formal training, and development
       activities.

     Managers must:
     * Support the development and training of their subordinates.
     * Determine the job-related knowledge, skills, abilities and
       experiences employees need to effectively accomplish the work of
       the organization.
     * Counsel, coach and guide employees in their professional
       development planning.
     * Help the employee define the short- and long-term development and
       training needs.

     Organizations must:
     * Assure an organizational structure exists that supports the
       required knowledge, skills, abilities and experience development of
       its employees.
     * Provide resources dollars and time for development to occur.
