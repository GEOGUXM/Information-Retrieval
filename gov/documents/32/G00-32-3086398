     __________________________________________________________________

   The NOAA Ship DELAWARE II conducts fishery and living marine resource
   research in support of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS),
   Northeast Fisheries Science Center's Woods Hole Laboratory in Woods
   Hole, MA. The ship's normal operating area is the Gulf of Maine,
   Georges Bank, and the continental shelf and slope from Southern New
   England to Cape Hatteras, NC. Typical assessment work includes
   groundfish assessment surveys and Marine Resources Monitoring,
   Assessment and Prediction (MARMAP) surveys. Research conducted from the
   DELAWARE II provides an understanding of the physical and biological
   processes that control year-class strength of key economical fish
   species. The vessel is operated by the Office of Marine and Aviation
   Operations.
