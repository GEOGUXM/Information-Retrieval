   1.     Objective. The fundamental objective of Severe Storm Reporting
   Networks is to provide timely and accurate reports of severe weather in
   support of the National Weather Service (NWS) Severe Local Storm
   Warning Program. When practical, these networks should be tailored to
   support other NWS warning programs, such as flash floods and winter
   storms.

   2.     Responsibilities. Each office with warning responsibility will
   develop severe storm spotter networks commensurate with the risk in its
   area of responsibility and the availability of communications.
   Arrangements for receiving, distributing, and using reports in severe
   weather statements, warnings, and other issuances will be included in
   the Station Duty Manual.

   2.1     National Weather Service Headquarters (WSH). WSH provides broad
   guidance to the program. The Weather and Flood Warnings Coordination
   Staff, Wx5, coordinates activities between the NWS regions and WSH
   staff offices, as well as with the Federal Emergency Management Agency
   (FEMA), to ensure compliance with the NOAA/FEMA Memorandum of
   Understanding (MOU). Furthermore, it develops and distributes
   audio-visual training aids and publications for spotter training.

   2.2     Regional Headquarters. Regional headquarters monitor the
   spotter program for accomplishment of goals and maintenance of quality
   control, and, when appropriate, initiate recommendations for Public
   Service Awards for individual spotters or groups. Reference MOU Annex A
   work plan -- NWS-FEMA responsibilities for maintaining spotter
   networks.

   2.3     Weather Service Forecast Offices (WSFO's). For its county
   warning area, each WSFO will accomplish the tasks assigned to a Weather
   Service office (WSO) in Section 2.4. The area manager will evaluate the
   area-wide status and adequacy of spotter networks. Further, the area
   manager will:

    a. Ensure that the latest spotter training techniques and materials
       are used by the WSO's in the area manager's area of responsibility;
    b. Ensure that reports are being relayed between adjacent county
       warning areas; and
    c. Establish and monitor an area-wide plan for effective collection
       and utilization of reports by NWS offices operating in a backup
       role.

   2.4     Weather Service Offices (WSO's). As the backbone of the NWS
   warning system, WSO's must place a high priority upon the development
   and maintenance of severe local storm spotter networks. In addition to
   ensuring that the coverage of the networks is sufficient, each WSO
   meteorologist in charge/ official in charge/hydrologist in charge
   (MIC/OIC/HIC) will:

    a. Encourage and assist communities to develop spotter networks to
       meet both local government and NWS requirements;
    b. Provide initial and refresher training to ensure spotters are
       knowledgeable of the latest developments in severe weather
       identification and reporting;
    c. Ensure that reports are relayed to adjacent WSO's/WSFO's as
       appropriate;
    d. Ensure that WSO personnel are familiar with procedures for
       obtaining, using, and distributing reports and that they accomplish
       these functions in an effective manner; and
    e. Provide the backup office with up-to-date lists of spotter contact
       or relay points. Instruct spotters to report to backup office if
       contact cannot be established with the primary WSO.

   3.     Recruitment. Whenever possible, make use of existing networks
   established by local Civil Defense (CD) officials, law enforcement
   agencies, amateur radio operators, and other groups with mobile
   communications capabilities, such as state highway departments, park
   rangers, etc.

   In this initial contact stage, it is essential that the potential
   spotter group be given a frank and objective explanation of its role
   and mission in support of the NWS warning program. It should be
   explained that casual or fleeting interest is not sufficient. Training,
   communications, and activation procedures should be thoroughly
   discussed.

   3.1     Emergency Service Organizations. Fire departments and law
   enforcement agencies have been the backbone of the spotter program for
   years. The state highway patrol and troopers have proven especially
   effective. Emergency medical services, utility crews, and other such
   groups should be given consideration in any recruiting effort. These
   organizations have the necessary communications and a basic involvement
   in public safety. Participation and training of these organizations are
   essential to a successful spotter program in most communities.
   Nevertheless, total reliance upon these groups can be risky as their
   availability as spotters has to take second priority to their primary
   emergency functions.

   Local CD or emergency management agencies should be encouraged to
   develop and maintain spotter networks which will support both local
   warning systems (sirens, cable override, etc.) and the NWS program.
   Some CD agencies have their own communications system, and most have
   access to their local police and fire units. As a result, they are
   often excellent contact and relay points between spotters and the NWS.
   This is especially true where National Warning System (NAWAS) drops
   exist. Despite their desire to cooperate with the NWS, many CD groups
   lack the resources to maintain a reliable spotter network and/or the
   means of relaying reports to the NWS. Under these conditions, it will
   be necessary to seek the assistance of volunteer groups.

   3.2     Volunteer Organizations. Many CD agencies and NWS offices
   receive valuable spotter assistance from the Amateur Radio Service
   (HAMS) and the Citizen's Band (CB) service. While Amateur Radio and
   Citizen's Band may appear to be similar, they are completely separate
   and distinct as their capabilities and limitations are very different.
   It is important to have an understanding of both of these groups if
   plans to use either or both for spotter support are to be soundly
   based. Both services have demonstrated a very high spirit of
   cooperation and willingness to support various emergency communication
   needs. An important point to be considered in arranging support from
   either group is mobilization time. These services are operated
   exclusively by persons who have an interest in radio but whose primary
   occupation is other than the operation of this equipment. Advance
   notification for activation (usually 30 minutes or less) is needed in
   most situations. Once activated, these networks are usually totally
   dedicated to their primary spotter function, unlike emergency service
   organizations which may have higher priority functions to perform.
   Reference WSOM Chapter G-52.

   3.3     Individual Citizens. In sparsely populated regions or areas
   where damaging severe local storms occur infrequently, finding
   emergency or volunteer groups to serve as spotters is difficult. Use of
   individual citizens as spotters that report by commercial telephone
   may, in some cases, be the best or only available option.

   3.4     Substation Observers. Substation observers are encouraged to
   report when a tornado or flood-causing rain is observed in progress
   (Observing Handbook No. 2, Substation Observations). In many cases,
   substation observers are eager to report other severe weather events on
   a real-time basis. Substation network specialists (SNS) know their
   observers and can be of great assistance in this area. Any attempt to
   involve substation observers in a spotter role will be coordinated
   through the responsible SNS.

   4.     Training. Both initial and refresher spotter training events are
   essential. Such training not only provides the spotter with the
   necessary skills and confidence; in addition, it increases the users'
   confidence in the reports. Training sessions also provide the
   opportunity to motivate and encourage spotters.

   Although training must usually be scheduled at the spotter's
   convenience, sessions should be planned to ensure effective use of NWS
   resources. Annual training is usually necessary in areas with a high
   incidence of severe weather. As resources allow, refresher training
   should be made available to the spotter at least every 2 years.
   Training should be conducted by NWS personnel or others who have
   demonstrated their ability to provide training which meets NWS
   standards.

   Spotter training presentations should be tailored to the local area. As
   a minimum, training presentations will include the use of the film,
   "Tornado: A Spotter's Guide," and a slide series supplement to
   "Tornado: A Spotter's Guide." The slide series may be modified to meet
   local needs, but all key points in the series should be covered fully.

   The publication, "Spotter's Guide for Identifying and Reporting Severe
   Local Storms," was initially designed and used as the primary spotter
   training aid. As such, its distribution was unrestricted. This
   publication has now been revised for use as a field reference guide for
   spotters who have completed NWS approved training that included both
   the film and slide presentations. It should only be provided to
   spotters who have completed such training and not used otherwise. Its
   cost and purpose prohibit its use as a general handout.

   Spotter training should not be limited to volunteers in the field. NWS
   radar operators, forecasters, and other staff members involved in the
   warning process should also receive spotter training. This is essential
   if they are to evaluate spotter reports effectively.

   5.     Operational Considerations. The effectiveness of the spotter
   program depends upon more than the actions of spotters in the field.
   NWS personnel must provide proper evaluation and interpretation of the
   reports. Tools such as radar and satellite data and meso-scale
   analysis, should be utilized. Care should be taken to avoid
   discrediting a report because it does not conform to the current radar
   presentation. In many cases, trained spotters are superior to radar in
   the detection of severe weather events. The spotters provide
   "ground-truth" information that can be used effectively with radar to
   track known or suspected severe storms.

   Real-time radar reports can be of great value to spotters, helping them
   to position themselves properly to observe storm features. Where
   communication capabilities exist, NWS offices should provide radar
   reports, whenever practical, to spotter network control points.

   Care should be taken to ensure proper credit is given to the source of
   a report in severe weather statements and warnings. This not only adds
   credibility to the warning message but also serves as a form of
   recognition to the spotter. Names of individual spotters should not be
   used but their organization should be properly identified.

   6.     Recognition. In addition to contributing their time and personal
   resources, spotters often risk their own personal safety. Proper and
   timely recognition of these contributions is essential. Often this may
   only be in the form of a telephone call or letter to express
   appreciation. For more significant contributions, a Special Service
   Award (WSOM Chapter B-17) or a Public Service Award (WSOM Chapter I-80)
   should be considered.

   7.     Liability. A volunteer non-paid observer supporting NWS severe
   storm or flash flood networks may be considered as being an "employee"
   under the Federal Employees Compensation Act. The final determination
   as to eligibility and extent of coverage under the Act rests with the
   Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), Employment Standards
   Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. This program is administered
   by OWCP district offices across the country.

   Any spotter injured while performing listed observational duties or in
   the process of reporting an observation either directly to an NWS
   office or to the nearest authorized local official should direct
   questions about compensation under the Federal Employees Compensation
   Act to the appropriate NWS regional office for forwarding to OWCP. A
   claim may be in the form of a specific letter of particulars from the
   volunteer to the appropriate NWS office receiving the report, either
   directly or through some local official. The letter should be
   accompanied by Forms CA-1 and CA-4 signed by the volunteer and the
   MIC/OIC/HIC, and CA-20 signed by the attending physician. Required
   forms are available from regional personnel offices. Pertinent
   billings, receipts, or other supporting documents or statements should
   be attached and submitted to Personnel Division, Regional Headquarters.

   Reporting procedure cards or other reporting guides should not
   designate spotters as "official." Terms such as "Volunteer Storm
   Reporter" or "Spotter" are preferred. The distinction is necessary to
   avoid conflicts with the official status of designated substation
   observers and to assure, if claims are to be properly processed, the
   "spotters" have been clearly designated as volunteers to a community
   program.
