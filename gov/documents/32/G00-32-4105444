   Introduction

   Mars: A Dry Planet Compared to Earth

   When we look at Mars today, we see a planet without the deep blue
   oceans, lakes, and rivers that our own planet has in abundance. If
   Earth is the "big blue marble," then Mars is the red, dusty one. Many
   scientists believe, however, that Mars once had much more water than is
   visible today. Billions of years ago, Earth and Mars might have been
   very similar places.

   But if Mars once had lots of water, where did it go? The answer to that
   question is one of the greatest mysteries we hope to solve in our
   exploration of Mars.

   If there is any liquid water flowing onto the surface of Mars today
   from below ground, it doesn't last long. Temperature and pressure
   conditions on the surface would either freeze or "evaporate" it right
   away.

   Without a clear presence of surface water, it may seem strange that the
   science strategy for Mars exploration is "to follow the water." How can
   we do that, when it doesn't seem like there is any to be found?

   Following the water really means looking for scientific evidence that
   water was present in the past or is present today, either below the
   surface or possibly in rare locations near small, hydrothermal vents
   like those we might find at Yellowstone. Our Mars missions have already
   sent back views of the Martian surface that seem to show evidence of
   dry riverbeds, flood plains, rare gullies on Martian cliffs and crater
   walls, and sedimentary deposits that suggest the presence of water at
   some point in the history of Mars.

   Take a look at our images from Mars, and be your own detective in
   looking for clues that indicate the past or present presence of water.

   Water," brought to you by NASA Science News.
