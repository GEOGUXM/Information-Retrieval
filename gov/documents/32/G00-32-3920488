                        Seamless Access and Delivery

  Objectives

     * to provide full-resolution browse access and delivery of selected
       USGS datasets in seamless GIS-ready form
     * to provide these data to emergency and disaster response programs,
       to Federal users, and to Strategic Partners (e.g. Open Data Access,
       OGIS Web Mapping Testbed, FGDC Clearinghouses)
     * to provide geospatial data delivery using online downloads and
       offline products that adhere to FGDC and NSDI principals and
       standards (e.g. SDTS TVPand RPE; FGDC GEO-Metadata; NSDI
       Clearinghouse, Framework, and Standards)

Seamless Databases

   [sastamps.gif] The SAST Database - In response to the 1993 floods on
   the Mississippi and Missouri River systems, the White House Office of
   Science and Technology Policy commissioned an eight agency, 18-member,
   Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team (SAST) to assess the impacts of
   flooding. To support the SAST, the USGS brought together a team of
   scientists and technicians to develop a GIS database and produce
   cartographic products required by the SAST. The team required high
   quality maps to be generated for the rivers and upland basins of the
   upper Mississippi and lower Missouri Rivers, an area involving up to 13
   states and 1/4 of the conterminous United States.

   [sastteams.jpg] In order to meet the ambitious schedule of the SAST,
   the EDC support team worked day and night on seamless libraries for
   over 480 - 100K quadrangles that contained over 80 categories of vector
   data. These libraries were used for detailed reference and for thematic
   mapping of the SAST study area. The support group correctly perceived
   that if they did their jobs well, this database could be maintained and
   extended for future applications. For a time, their efforts were
   supported by a Hazard Preparedness and Disaster Response activity at
   EDC that raised visibility of "proactive" efforts such as the SAST
   library development. Over a couple years, the libraries were extended
   some layers to complete the conterminous United States. In 1999, these
   library layers of vector data were loaded into ESRI's Spatial Database
   Engine (SDE), a system that better facilitates seamless access and
   delivery.

   [nhds.jpg] [nhdsamps.jpg] The National Hydrography Dataset - the
   National Hydrography Dataset was begun in 1994 as a partnership of EPA
   and USGS to combine EPA's Reach Files (RF3), with USGS's 100K
   hydrography data. In addition to combining the spatial characteristics
   of the USGS files with the attributes of EPA files, the system was
   designed to allow data for hydrologic basins or river systems to be
   extracted out without regard to quadrangle boundaries or the limits of
   a basin. This notion of seamless query resulted in a unique Feature
   Oriented Database that was subsequently implemented using SDE
   technology. As of this writing, NHD delivery is limited to cataloging
   units, but the basic design of the FOD is ready and waiting for a
   seamless delivery "engine".

   [NEDlogos.jpg] The National Elevation Dataset - The National Elevation
   Dataset (NED) was begun in 1996, inspired by the release of GTOPO30, a
   30-second resolution global elevation dataset assembled from
   best-available sources. In taking on a one-second resolution NED
   design, the same people who had built GTOPO30 began work on over 50,000
   24K quadrangles of data. The work involved assembling, filtering, edge
   matching, and resampling to a common datum and projection. They coined
   a motto, "Today the World, Tomorrow the United States".

   [neduss.gif] NED is now complete, and is in a monthly update cycle,
   drawing off new and revised DEM quadrangles from the USGS's Sales
   Database. The NED team is working on a series of hydrologic
   deriviatives, called NED-H, and also in the planning stages of a higher
   resolution 1/3 arc-second version of NED that takes advantage of the 10
   meter resolution DEM's that are becoming available for a significant
   part of the conterminous United States. An interim delivery mechanism
   has been designed to allow customers to gain access to NED. Based on
   the interest that has been expressed to date, a new motto has been
   circulating among the staff, "If you build it, they will come."

   [mrlcs.jpg] The National Land Cover Dataset - The National Land Cover
   Characterization project is part of the interagency Multi-Resolution
   Land Characterization (MRLC) initiative involving three divisions of
   the US Geological Survey (National Mapping Division, Water Resources
   Division, and the Biological Resources Division), the Environmental
   Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
   and the US Forest Service. [washdcs.jpg] These agencies have a
   requirement for a nationally consistent land cover dataset, and in 1993
   these agencies combined financial resources to purchase Landsat
   Thematic Mapper data covering the entire United States. The USGS/EROS
   Data Center took the lead to process the data and develop the National
   Land Cover Data (NLCD) set. The NLCD will be completed by the end of
   Calendar 1999, and will be available on CD as statewide coverages. In
   addition, NLCD will be made available for seamless access and delivery.

Cooperative Research and Development Agreement

   In 1995, USGS and Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI)
   entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA)
   to work together to evaluate USGS's feature-oriented NHD data model in
   ESRI's SDE.

   In 1999, the USGS and ESRI entered into a new CRADA relationship with
   expanded scope. The new agreement has a duration of 36 months, and
   bears the ambitious title of Research and development of spatial data
   modeling, management, access,and distribution systems for large-scale
   databases. The CRADA contains several activities that involve Internet
   developments, as well as data delivery systems developments unique to
   specific data collections, namely the NHD, NED, Land Cover, and the
   National Atlas Project. Specific CRADA Program Activities are described
   in Appendix A that will lead to a seamless server, as follows:

     * A.1 National Hydrography Dataset Access - Contacts: USGS - Blaine
       Ailts, ESRI - Christoph Graf
     * A.3 National Atlas of the US Program - Contacts: USGS - Jay
       Donnelly, ESRI - Jim Ciarrocca
     * A.4 Land Cover and Image Data - Contacts: USGS - Dave Greenlee,
       ESRI - Mike Boyd
     * A.8 Global GIS Program - Contacts: USGS - Paul Hearn, ESRI - Dan
       Sherrill

   The following paragraph, extracted from the CRADA document, explains
   how USGS and ESRI have set up the early phasing so that tasks can be
   taken on as resources become available:

     To increase the effectiveness of each of the teams developing
     intranet/internet applications, the A.4 - Land Cover and Image Data
     program will be used as a model for the others. Phase I of this
     activity will kick off at the initiation of the CRADA effort. The
     purpose of Phase I is to assemble a prototype image browser and
     server using COTS software and existing logically seamless datasets
     at EDC. Several ESRI products will be used in this effort:
     MapObjects, MapObjects Internet Map Server, and the Spatial Database
     Engine.
