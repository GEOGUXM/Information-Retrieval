   The Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) Program is a
   state-of-the-art, real-time weather information system that replaces
   manual surface observation techniques and, thereby, providing improved
   efficiency in acquiring and recording surface atmospheric phenomena.
   The acquisition of these systems is managed by the ASOS Acquisition
   Office, which is part of National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration's Systems Acquisition Office.

   Among ASOS's users are the National Weather Service, the Federal
   Aviation Administration, and the Department of Defense. ASOS also
   provides hourly transmittals of weather data to local authorities, air
   traffic control facilities, and the media.

   The first ASOS was installed in August 1991 in Topeka, Kansas. Over 900
   units are planned for installation throughout the United States
   including Alaska, Hawaii, the Caribbean, and military installations
   overseas.
