          Advanced supercomputers have simulated extremely powerful energy
   jets squirted out by black holes, the most exotic and powerful objects
   in the Universe.

          "This research helps us unlock the mysteries of rotating black
   holes and confirms that their rotation actually produces power output,"
   said Dr. David Meier, an astrophysicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion
   Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. Meier is co-author of a paper that will
   appear in the journal Science. The leader of the research team is Dr.
   Shinji Koide of Toyama University, Toyama, Japan.

          A black hole is an object so dense and powerful that nothing,
   not even light, can escape. A black hole gobbles up stars and other
   material that approaches it, including other black holes. These odd
   objects form in one of two ways - when a dying star collapses, or when
   many stars and black holes collapse together in the center of a galaxy,
   like our Milky Way.

          Both types of black holes can rotate very rapidly, dragging
   along the space around them. When more material falls in, it swirls and
   struggles wildly before being swallowed. Astronomers have witnessed
   this violence, including the ejection of jets, with radio and X-ray
   observations, but they are not able to see a black hole itself.

          "We can't travel to a black hole, and we can't make one in the
   lab, so we used supercomputers," Meier said. This simulation process is
   similar to weather-prediction techniques, which create animation of how
   clouds are expected to move, based on current satellite views and
   knowledge about Earth's atmosphere and gravity effects. In much the
   same way, the scientists combined data about plasma swirling into a
   black hole with knowledge about how gravity and magnetic fields would
   affect it.

          "We have modeled a rotating black hole with magnetized plasma
   falling into it," said Koide. "We simulated the way that the magnetic
   field harnesses energy from the rotation of the black hole."

          "In this case, jets of pure electromagnetic energy are ejected
   by the magnetic field along the north and south poles above the black
   hole," Meier added. "The jets contain energy equivalent to the power of
   the Sun, multiplied ten billion times and then increased another one
   billion times."

          This jet phenomenon had been predicted by Professor Roger
   Blandford of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif.,
   and his colleague, Roman Znajek, in the 1970s, but the new computer
   simulation confirms that prediction. The latest research was conducted
   in late 2001 using supercomputers at Japan's National Institute for
   Fusion Science.

          Scientists have theorized the existence of black holes since the
   1700s and identified jet-producing objects in the centers of galaxies
   since the early 1900s. In the 1960s, scientists explored the
   possibility that these jet-emitting objects were supermassive black
   holes between one million and several billion times heavier than our
   Sun. In the 1990s, it was discovered that such jets also are ejected by
   much smaller black holes in double star systems. A black hole ten times
   as massive as the Sun can form when the center of a dying star, 20 to
   30 times the mass of the Sun, collapses on itself. This creates a tiny
   object, only a few miles across, with an intense gravitational pull.
   The other supermassive type of black hole is formed when many stars and
   black holes collapse together in the center of a galaxy.

          In addition to Koide and Meier, the team includes colleagues Dr.
   Kazunari Shibata, Kyoto University, Kyoto, and Dr. Takahiro Kudoh,
   National Astronomical Observatory, Mitaka. Images of the research are
   available at http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/blackholes .

          The research was partially funded by an Astrophysics Theory
   Grant from NASA. The California Institute of Technology in Pasadena
   manages JPL for NASA.
