   UMass researchers find environment on Earth that mimics Mars
   geochemically and supports ancient life form
   University of Massachusetts

      AMHERST, Mass. - Deep below the surface of the Beverhead Mountains of
      Idaho, a research team led by Derek Lovley, head of the microbiology
      department at the University of Massachusetts, and Francis H. Chappelle
      of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has found an unusual community of
      microoganisms that may hold the key to understanding how life could
      survive on Mars. Their findings are spelled out in the Jan. 17 issue of
      the journal Nature (vol. 415).

      "The microbial community we found in Idaho is unlike any previously
      described on Earth," said Lovley. "This is as close as we have come to
      finding life on Earth under geological conditions most like those
      expected below the surface of Mars.

      "Life requires water and an energy source. The primary energy source
      for life on earth is sunlight. Plants convert sunlight energy to
      organic matter that other organisms then use for fuel. On Mars and
      other planets or moons in our solar system on which life might exist,
      liquid water is only available below the surface where there is no
      sunlight. So, if there is life, it must sustain itself with alternative
      energy sources. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that
      certain microorganisms can thrive in the absence of sunlight by using
      hydrogen gas released from deep in the Earth's surface as their energy
      source."

      Lovley added: "The microbial community found at the Idaho site is
      remarkably similar to what geochemists have postulated might be found
      below the surface of Mars, based on what they know of Martian
      subsurface chemistry. Now that such a community has been discovered, we
      can use it to test hypotheses about hydrogen-based subsurface life, and
      use these findings to develop strategies for searching for similar
      microbial communities on other planets."

      According to Lovley, geologists and microbiologists have searched for
      at least a decade for a community of microorganisms on Earth that could
      survive on hydrogen, somewhere underground, away from sunlight.
      Chappelle, of USGS, explained that he specifically chose the Idaho site
      for the study because it provided geological conditions most like those
      expected on Mars. "The water deep within these volcanic rocks has been
      isolated from the surface for thousands of years. It is devoid of
      measurable organic matter, but contains significant amounts of
      hydrogen," said Chappelle.

      Lovley added: "In prior studies, when we looked in underground areas we
      considered promising, the DNA signatures of the bacteria present
      indicated they were living on organic matter carried in the groundwater
      or that had been deposited along with the subsurface of rocks. Those
      environments are not likely to represent conditions on Mars because, on
      Mars, such organic matter would not be available.

      "At the Idaho site we saw something completely different," Lovley
      continued. "Over 90 percent of the microorganisms were Archaea, which
      are microorganisms considered to be most closely related to ancient
      life on Earth. In this case, the Archaea were methane-producing
      microorganisms that live by combining hydrogen with carbon dioxide to
      make methane gas. They do not require organic carbon in order to grow.
      This is exactly the scenario that geochemists have predicted for life
      on Mars," explained Lovley.

      The study was funded by the U.S. Geological Survey and a grant from the
      Life in Extreme Environments program of the National Science
      Foundation. In addition to Lovley and Chappelle, the team included
      Stacy A. Clufo, Barbara A. Meth√© and Kathleen O'Neill of UMass; Paul M.
      Bradley of USGS, Columbia, S.C.; and LeRoy L. Knobel, USGS, Idaho
      Falls, Idaho.
