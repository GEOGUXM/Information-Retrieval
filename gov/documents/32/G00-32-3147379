   This page contains everything you need to know about downloading OEHHA
   documents. For your convenience, you can print this page by using the
   print command in your browser.
     * Basic Information (First-time users: Start Here!)
     * Adobe Acrobat PDF Files

     * Download the Adobe Acrobat Reader
     * Translate to HTML or text files for screen readers

     * Alternative Formats (Braille, tape, large print, diskette)
     * Troubleshooting

   Basic Information

   OEHHA's web page is located on a web server (read: large computer) at
   Fresno State University. We store files on that computer which you can
   download. "Downloading" is the act of copying a file from one computer
   on the information superhighway to another computer. The highway
   analogy holds for most downloading activities. Downloading goes fastest
   when there are less people on the road, smaller files travel faster,
   etc.
   OEHHA documents are available in the following ways:
     * Adobe Acrobat PDF Files - These are Portable Document Format files
       created using Adobe Acrobat. This company distributes a FREE
       Acrobat Reader, which you can download. The files can be read by
       anyone on almost any computer platform (i.e. Macintosh, PC, UNIX,
       etc.).
     * HTML files - files that can be read on an Internet browser screen.

   For more information about these types of files, see below:

   Adobe Acrobat PDF files
   Adobe Acrobat PDF files are fairly common on the web today. They offer
   2 major benefits. First, they can be viewed and printed on any platform
   (Macintosh, PC/Windows, UNIX, etc.). One simply needs to download the
   FREE Acrobat Reader from Adobe's WWW site. Second, they maintain the
   same formatting and pagination regardless of the computer/printer setup
   being used. This can be a major problem if pagination is a key issue
   (such as commentors referring to page X of a draft document). To solve
   these problems, OEHHA has begun using Adobe Acrobat PDF's.

   If you don't have Adobe Reader, you'll have to download it from Adobe's
   Acrobat Reader Distribution Page on their web site (www.adobe.com). The
   Reader takes up approximately 2 Megs of space on your hard drive. Once
   you have downloaded it, it will activate any time you double click on a
   file with the extension *.PDF.

   If you have problems downloading or installing the Adobe Acrobat
   Reader, please contact Adobe.

   Step-by-Step Instructions on Downloading OEHHA PDF Files

    1. Click on a link to a PDF file. You'll notice that when your cursor
       is on top of a link, a pathway appears in the box under your
       browser. If the file in that pathway ends in ".pdf", it's an Adobe
       Acrobat PDF file.
    2. Follow your browser's instructions on downloading the file to your
       hard drive. This usually involves choosing the "Save" option for
       dealing with a file. It usually takes about 1-5 minutes for most
       documents on OEHHA's home page.
    3. Find the document on your hard drive (using File Manager, etc.).
    4. Double click on the file name in File Manager (or open Adobe
       Acrobat Reader and choose "File/Open").
    5. If you cannot open the file, please see Troubleshooting.

                             Alternative formats

   We are happy to provide any of our information in a format that is most
   useable to you. If you need a document in large print, Braille or other
          format, please contact our Webmistress, Laurie Monserrat
   (lmonserr@oehha.ca.gov), or (916)327-7333 to request any OEHHA document
                           in an alternate format.

                               Troubleshooting

    My download speed (in bytes/min) slows to almost zero and the browser
                         suddenly stops downloading.
      It sounds like your ISP (Internet Service Provider) is timing out
     before you get the entire document. This happens when your download
    speed slows to almost zero and the browser stops downloading in order
      to avoid locking up. Some of the big ISP's have terrible download
     times. With Netscape, you can actually watch the speed decrease to
   almost zero before it times out. Such time-out's, unfortunately, don't
      come with any messages or warnings. Any partial file from such a
              download will either not open or contain errors.
     The solution is to try downloading at a "non-peak" time of the day.
   Weekends are universally bad (especially evenings). You may want to try
     it early in the morning on weekdays. Basically, any time that other
   people won't be using your ISP is the best time to download files. The
     best/worst times differ from ISP to ISP, so I'd recommend E-mailing
                 your ISP to find out what those times are.

   I double-click on the PDF file and it won't open. It gives me a warning
                    about "association" in File Manager.
    This probable means you don't have Adobe Acrobat Reader or it is not
     configured properly. I suggest completely reloading it. If you have
     further difficulties, please contact Adobe. We are not qualified to
                 answer questions regarding Adobe software.

    I went to get "that Acrobat program", but it costs $300! I don't want
                             to spend that much!
   STOP! You're considering purchasing the full Adobe Acrobat package! You
     want the Adobe Acrobat READER, which is a FREE product available on
     Adobe's web site! Adobe Acrobat is an excellent application for web
    publishing, but you only need the Adobe Acrobat Reader to open OEHHA
                                 documents.

    I've tried everything and it STILL won't work. Can I get a hard copy?
    Yes! All of our documents are available in hardcopy (though sometimes
    for a fee). Please check the specific documents distribution page for
                     information on how to order a copy.

                  I'm still lost. How do I get more help!?!
    You can contact the OEHHA Webmistress by E-mailing your questions to
                           the following address:
                            Lmonserr@oehha.ca.gov

      Please include all relevant information, including the following:
     * Type of computer (Mac or PC).
     * Internet Service Provider (AOL, University-based, LAN-based, etc.).
     * Time(s) of day you attempted downloads.
     * Detailed account of the problem, including all error messages.
     * Your name and location (Optional, but helpful).
