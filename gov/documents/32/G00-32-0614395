   Deep Impact seeks to provide as much quick access material as possible
   to the public. Check our Fact Sheet for a short overview on the mission
   and then pick up more detail by visiting the Mission section. If you
   are already familiar with our site, Quick Facts will give you a brief
   look at mission specs. If you want to know what's been happening with
   the mission, look into our Archives for past press releases. As we draw
   closer to launch, you will be provided with an on-line Press Kit.

   Flyby Spacecraft with Impactor If you are looking for high-resolution
   images of the spacecraft, you can download TIFF and JPEG versions and a
   text caption. For more information about the flyby spacecraft and its
   components, visit Technology. For details about the mission, visit
   Mission.

   If you are looking for images, visit our Image Gallery or Small
   Telescopes Science Program (STSP) for visuals of Comet Tempel 1 taken
   by our international network of amateur astronomers. If you're
