                    Florida Caribbean Science Center

   The Sirenia Project is a team of federally-funded scientists dedicated
   to long-term research on the West Indian manatee in Florida. The
   Project is part of the Florida Caribbean Science Center, based in
   Gainesville, Florida. During 2000, the Sirenia Project employed 9
   biologists and 1 administrative assistant. Our Fiscal Year 2000 budget
   was $441,000 in base funds, $40,000 from the U.S. Geological Survey
   (USGS) Place-based Program, and $62,500 from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service (FWS). Funds were received for specific activities as noted
   below.
   Reproduction traits and population dynamics of Florida manatees based
   on photo-identification techniques. Many manatees are identifiable by
   unique and permanent body features, primarily scars from strikes by
   watercraft. This study focuses on the identification of individual
   manatees based on photographic records of these features. Dr. Catherine
   Langtimm, with the Restoration Ecology Branch of the Florida Caribbean
   Science Center, is collaborating in development of survival,
   reproduction, and rate of scar acquisition estimates. She and Cathy
   Beck completed a retrospective analysis of adult survival using 19
   years of photo-documented sightings of known individuals from the
   Northwest Gulf coast population. They found lower survival during three
   years with major hurricanes or extra-tropical storms. In years without
   major storms, annual survival estimates averaged 97.2 %; in years with
   storms (1985, 1993, and 1995), adult survival ranged between 81.7 and
   93.6%. They are using the same dataset to estimate past storm effects
   on manatee reproduction rate. Hurricane activity in the western
   Atlantic occurs in quasi-cyclic multi-decade regimes that alternate
   between active and quiet phases. The Gulf has been in a quiet phase,
   but is moving into a predicted active phase. Understanding how climate
   change affects the complex aquatic systems of the Gulf of Mexico will
   require continued long-term monitoring and modeling. Such studies
   should incorporate a diversity of aquatic species, including the
   long-lived Florida manatee.
   We continued documentation of individual manatees through
   photo-identification, maintenance of the long-term database (20+
   years), and further development of the Manatee Individual
   Photo-identification System (MIPS), all high priority actions in the
   implementation of the Florida Manatee Recovery Plan. The database
   currently includes specific identity and feature description data,
   photographic images, and over 22,000 sighting records and reproductive
   histories for nearly 1,500 individual manatees. Ron Osborn of the
   Mid-continent Ecological Science Center continued to assist with
   database management and development of software applications. The MIPS
   program and structure have been shared with the Florida Fish and
   Wildlife Conservation Commission, Florida Marine Research Institute
   (FMRI), and the Mote Marine Laboratory to assist in maintaining the
   database on manatees frequenting the southwest coast of Florida. We
   also initiated collaboration with Drs. Jim Nichols, Mike Runge, and
   Bill Kendall of the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center (PWRC), who are
   developing a stage-based model of manatee population dynamics, based on
   estimates of life history parameters derived from the photo-id
   database. We are also planning with Dr. Madan Oli, University of
   Florida, to examine the reproductive histories of individual manatees,
   if differences in age of first reproduction have fitness consequences,
   and if there are regional differences in fitness. This research is
   supported by FWS, USGS, and Save the Manatee Club.
   Use of strip-transect aerial surveys to assess manatee population
   trends. Manatee surveys have typically not been designed to sample
   quantified survey areas, or to produce estimates of abundance. In 2000,
   we collaborated with Terry Doyle, FWS, by designing and analyzing
   results from strip-transect aerial surveys of the Ten Thousand Islands
   (TTI) National Wildlife Refuge. Our objective is to determine if
   manatee density and distribution in the nearshore waters of the TTI and
   the Everglades National Park (ENP) change in response to restoration of
   natural hydrologic patterns in southwestern Florida. We want to
   statistically compare pre- and post-restoration indices of manatee
   abundance using strip-transect surveys in the TTI. We established 30
   parallel transects, 1 km apart, with a survey strip width of
   approximately 250 m. Six trial surveys were conducted between 25 July
   and 22 October 2000. The estimates of number of manatees in the study
   area ranged from 39 to 164, or 0.28 to 1.16 per km². The estimates for
   survey dates with conditions ranked as good to very good were 86 to
   164. We recommend that at least 6-8 surveys be conducted within a
   2-month period, with good to excellent survey conditions to minimize
   variation among surveys. Surveys should be repeated every year for a
   minimum of 4-5 years. Similar strip-transect surveys will be designed
   for other areas of the southwest coast in cooperation with ENP. This
   research was supported by the USGS/FWS Resource Partnership Quick
   Response Programs Zoo, and is part of a larger study on predicting and
   assessing the effects of hydrologic restoration on manatees in South
   Florida.
   Development of an adaptive management model to address the problem of
   manatee reliance on industrial warm water discharges. Adaptive
   management seems to be an excellent tool for assessing and reducing the
   influence of industrial warm-water effluents, particularly
   power-generating plants, on manatee population dynamics. We are
   collaborating with Drs. Mike Runge, Jim Nichols, and Bill Kendall of
   the PWRC to develop several alternative models of manatee response to
   changes in power plant operations, based primarily on manatee
   photo-identification and radio tracking studies conducted by our
   research team. Removal of thermal effluents can be viewed as a
   restoration action, but the short and long-term impacts on manatees are
   uncertain. We plan to work with colleagues at the Florida Marine
   Research Institute and plant industry personnel to design and test
   management strategies in an iterative process that, over time,
   optimizes the biological information obtained and improves management
   actions. This research is supported by FWS and USGS.
   Predicting and assessing the effects of hydrologic restoration on
   manatees in South Florida. This 5-year study was initiated in FY2000,
   as part of an integrated Center project to assess the impacts of
   hydrological restoration on estuarine communities of Southwest Florida.
   Given the manatee's reliance on freshwater and aquatic vegetation, we
   hypothesize that altered water management regimes will affect manatee
   distribution, relative abundance, habitat use, and movement patterns.
   We are collaborating with Drs. Carole McIvor, Don DeAngelis, Tom Smith,
   and other scientists in the Restoration Ecology Branch of the Florida
   Caribbean Science Center, as well as colleagues at the Florida Marine
   Research Institute, TTI National Wildlife Refuge, and ENP. In June
   2000, we initiated research on manatee movements through the use of
   radio telemetry and a data-logging Global Positioning System tag.
   Following release in Rookery Bay, a subadult female ("Keewi"), made
   several trips between Marco Island and the Gordon River in Naples
   before losing her tag. An adult male ("Poi") and female ("Surfer")
   moved south to the TTI/ENP. "Poi" made several trips between Marco
   Island and Port of the Island/ Faka Union Canal during July and early
   August. In mid-August, "Poi" traveled north to the Caloosahatchee River
   in Lee County. "Surfer" remained in the vicinity of the Huston and
   Chatham rivers for over two months. She developed a pattern of feeding
   on offshore seagrass beds near Pavilion Key, traveling approximately 16
   km every 3-5 days to Huston Bay, Last Huston Bay, and Chevelier Bay.
   She spent the winter (December-February) in Whitewater Bay.
   Temperature, availability of fresh water, and spatial distribution of
   submerged aquatic vegetation, particularly seagrasses, are probably the
   most important factors influencing manatee movement patterns along the
   southwest coast. We are also studying the distribution and relative
   abundance of manatees through the use of aerial strip-transect surveys
   (described above) and the status of submerged aquatic vegetation in the
   Ten Thousand Islands region. This research is supported by the USGS
   Place-based Program and the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden.
   Characterizing benthic habitat and manatee grazing activity in Puerto
   Rico. Our objective is to assess the long-term ecological status of
   seagrass resources in important manatee feeding areas. Unlike the
   Florida manatee, which utilizes primarily estuarine and freshwater
   habitats and feeds on a wide variety of submerged, floating, and
   emergent plants, Antillean manatees in Puerto Rico are found in marine
   habitats and depend upon seagrasses for food. Dr. Jud Kenworthy,
   seagrass ecologist with the National Ocean Service, collaborates with
   Jim Reid and Dean Easton in this research. They are utilizing radio
   tracking to reveal manatee movements and habitat use patterns in
   eastern Puerto Rico, and linking them to detailed maps of benthic
   habitat near the U.S. Naval Station Roosevelt Roads and Vieques Island.
   Six study sites, 4 at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station and 2 on the west
   coast of Puerto Rico, near Guanajibo, were assessed in April and
   December 2000 to determine seagrass distribution, abundance, standing
   crop, and leaf productivity in manatee feeding areas. The U.S. Navy is
   the major source of funding.
   Post-release monitoring of captive-reared manatees. Prior to 2000,
   several captive manatees ("Bertram," "Georgia," and "Clover") have been
   successfully released in Blue Spring State Park in the St. Johns River,
   Volusia County. Manatees utilize the excellent habitat provided by the
   Upper St. Johns River year-round, seeking refuge during cold periods in
   the warm, artesian spring-fed waters of Blue Spring run. Four
   captive-reared and one rehabilitated manatee were released in the
   spring run last winter and radio-tracked during 2000. "Comet" and
   "Cory" were released on 16 February, "Xoshi" was released on 22
   February, and "Brian" and "Calista" were released on 1 March. The
   manatees were fitted with satellite monitored, floating tag assemblies
   and belt-mounted VHF radio transmitters. "Comet," "Calista," "Cory,"
   and "Xoshi" were recaptured for biomedical assessment between 18 May
   and 15 June 2000. Three manatees had gained weight since their release
   and one ("Calista") was approximately the same weight. All were
   determined to be healthy, with blubber indices within the range of
   healthy wild manatees.
   "Comet" was tracked until 29 June, and spent most of his time in the
   Lake Monroe segment of the St. Johns River, south of Blue Spring. Park
   Ranger Wayne Hartley first observed "Comet" returning to Blue Spring in
   early December. "Calista" used both Lake Monroe and Lake Beresford and
   the St. Francis Dead River area to the north of Blue Spring. She was
   last radio-located on 29 June, and was first documented at Blue Spring
   on 27 November. After his release, "Brian" stayed in Lake Beresford
   until moving north to Lake Woodruff, where he was last observed on 5
   April. His belt, apparently cut by a boat propeller, was located by
   sonic tracking on 19 May in Lake Woodruff. He was first observed
   returning to Blue Spring on 22 November. "Cory" was captured for
   reassessment in Spring Garden Creek off Lake Woodruff on 19 May. His
   belt-mounted radio tag was removed that day because of his small size
   and rapid growth. "Xoshi" moved to Lake Dexter and Lake Woodruff
   following her initial release, but was predominantly located in Lake
   George. She was captured there for reassessment on 15 June. She lost
   her floating radio tag on 12 July when it became entangled in fishing
   gear in Lake George. She was located several more times in and near
   Lake George; however, attempts to re-tag her with a satellite-monitored
   transmitter were unsuccessful. She was last observed on 2 November in
   the St. Johns River just north of Lake George. Biologists tracked by
   boat and air (the latter by Cyndi Thomas, FMRI) on multiple occasions
   between July and late December, trying to locate manatees still
   carrying belt-mounted VHF transmitters.
   This winter, "Brian," "Calista," "Comet," and several previously
   released manatees were identified by Park Ranger Wayne Hartley when
   they returned to Blue Spring. The return of "Cory," and "Xoshi" was not
   confirmed this winter. They may have utilized some of the smaller
   springs in the Upper St. Johns (Silver Glen, DeLeon, or Salt Springs),
   or migrated to the Atlantic Coast. No belted manatees have been seen
   during ground observations of manatees aggregating at a Jacksonville
   power plant. We recommend that releases of naïve manatees at Blue
   Spring be done when ambient river temperatures are lower than in the
   spring run, to reinforce the pattern of use of Blue Spring as a thermal
   refuge. This research was supported by FWS, USGS, and Columbus Zoo.
   Manatee population genetics. Angela Garcia completed her dissertation,
   "Genetic Studies of the West Indian Manatee," in April 2000. Eight
   polymorphic DNA microsatellite loci were identified for use in
   population analysis. Tissue samples from 223 manatees were analyzed,
   approximately 45 from each of 5 regions of Florida. There is
   significant genetic differentiation between manatees on the east and
   west coasts; however, no significant differentiation was detected
   between groups within coasts. The low level of alleles detected for the
   8 loci (23 total) indicates a possible bottleneck or founder effect,
   followed by breeding among related individuals. The Florida manatee
   population can be considered a single evolutionary unit, which consists
   of two well-defined management units on the east and west coasts. This
   research was supported by the USGS, Columbus Zoo, and the Disney
   Foundation.
   Interagency cooperation. Project personnel participated in meetings of
   the Florida Manatee Recovery Team, the Manatee Population Status
   Working Group, the Interagency/ Oceanaria Captive Manatee Group, the
   Manatee GIS Working Group, Blue Spring Minimum Flow Working Group, and
   the Warm Water Task Force. Substantial contributions were made to the
   draft Third Revision of the Florida Manatee Recovery Plan.
