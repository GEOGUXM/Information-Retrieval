   * What is PACER?

      Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) is an electronic
      public access service that allows users to obtain case and docket
      information from Federal Appellate, District and Bankruptcy courts, and
      from the U.S. Party/Case Index. Currently most courts are available on
      the Internet. Links to these courts are provided from this web site.
      However, a few systems are not available on the Internet and must be
      dialed directly using communication software (such as ProComm Plus,
      pcAnywhere, or Hyperterminal) and a modem. Electronic access is
      available for most courts by registering with the PACER Service Center,
      the judiciary's centralized registration, billing, and technical
      support center.
      Each court maintains its own databases with case information. Because
      PACER database systems are maintained within each court, each
      jurisdiction will have a different URL or modem number. Accessing and
      querying information from each service is comparable; however, the
      format and content of information provided may differ slightly. Links
      and toll free modem numbers are provided to most jurisdictions.
      PACER is a service of United States Judiciary. The PACER Service Center
      is run by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.

   * Why use PACER?

      The PACER System offers an inexpensive, fast, and comprehensive case
      information service to any individual with a personal computer (PC) and
      a modem. The PACER system permits you to request information about a
      particular individual or case. The data is displayed directly on your
      PC screen within a few seconds. The system is simple enough that little
      user training or documentation is required.
        __________________________________________________________________

   * Available Information

      The PACER System offers electronic access to case dockets to retrieve
      information such as:
      * A listing of all parties and participants including judges,
          attorneys, and trustees
          * A compilation of case related information such as cause of
          action, nature of suit, and dollar demand
          * A chronology of dates of case events entered in the case record
          * A claims registry
          * A listing of new cases each day in the bankruptcy court
          * Appellate court opinions
          * Judgments or case status
          * Types of documents filed for certain cases
        __________________________________________________________________

   * U.S. Party/Case Index

      The U.S. Party/Case Index is a national index for U.S. district,
      bankruptcy, and appellate courts. A small subset of information from
      each case will be transferred to the U.S. Party/Case Index each night.
      The system serves as a locator index for PACER. You may conduct
      nationwide searches to determine whether or not a party is involved in
      federal litigation. For detailed information on cases found while
      searching the U.S. Party/Case Index, you will need to dial into the
      PACER system for the particular jurisdiction where the case is located.
        __________________________________________________________________

   * Availability

      The PACER System is available days, nights, and weekends. You can
      verify all updates to active and recently closed cases without having
      to make repeated trips to the court to review paper records. If there
      have been no updates, this can be confirmed in seconds.
        __________________________________________________________________

   * What you need

      * A personal computer or terminal
          * For Dial-up PACER:

      * A 9600 or higher baud modem
          * Terminal emulation software that supports VT100 emulation

      * For Internet PACER:
      * Internet access
          * Javascript enabled web browser
          __________________________________________________________________

* Cost

   The United States Congress has given the Judicial Conference of the
   United States, the judicial governing body of the U.S. Federal Courts,
   authority to impose user fees for electronic access to case
   information. For a history of the electronic public access fee and a
   current electronic public access fee schedule, click here. All
   registered agencies or individuals will be charged a user fee. Access
   to web based PACER systems will generate a $.07 per page charge. Access
   to dial-up PACER systems will generate a $.60 per minute charge. Users
   will NOT incur both per minute and per page charges for a PACER
   session. You will be billed on a quarterly basis for your transactions.
   You will be allowed to enter a client code of your choosing each time
   you login to PACER to help facilitate managing the costs.
   A measure was approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States
   in March 2001 stating that no fee is owed until a user accrues more
   than $10 worth of charges in a calendar year. Consequently, if an
   account does not accrue $10 worth of usage between January 1st and
   December 31st each year, all balances will be deleted from our records.
   This policy change will be effective for the calendar year of 2001, and
   statements will not be mailed to PACER users whose accounts do not have
   a balance due of at least $10. Once the balance due exceeds $10, a user
   will receive a statement by mail which includes the current and
   previous charges in a calendar year. Please read the announcement
   detailing this change.

* Sample Data

   There are two distinct and separate dial-up PACER services: one for the
   U.S. District Courts and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and the
   second for the U.S. Bankruptcy Courts. The method of accessing and
   querying for information from the two services is comparable; however,
   the format and content of information provided differ. Some sample data
   is provided to give a "look and feel" for each type of dial-up PACER
   service.
