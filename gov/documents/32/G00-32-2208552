                       IDL Astronomy Library Search Page

   This page provides a search of the one-line descriptions of procedures
   in the IDL Astronomy Library (including all the contrib directories
   except /varosi ). The search includes procedures from the Markwardt and
   Fanning libraries and most intrinsic IDL procedures. Type in a string
   (procedure name(s), word(s), part of a word) in the box to search
   through the libraries.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Enter a string or several strings (separated by spaces) here to search
   the libraries:
   __________________________________________________ Search Clear
   Place a + in front of a required string, a - in front of an excluding
   string, and place "double quotes" around a string containing a space.
   For example: +fit spline linear -gauss -"fits header" will find all
   procedures whose headers contain fit, but do not contain either gauss
   or fits header, and do contain either spline or linear.

   Another search page for IDL procedures is available at the U. of
   Washington Astronomy IDL Page (last updated 21-Dec-2000). This page
   includes a much larger database of public IDL libraries, but may not be
   current with the IDL Astronomy Library. For procedures related to solar
   astronomy, also check the SolarSoft Library Search
