         Finkbeiner aims to expand commute options with “green lanes”



   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
   January 22, 2002

                                                   FOR INTERVIEWS CONTACT:
                                       Sen. Bill Finkbeiner (360) 786-7672

                OLYMPIA…Sen. Bill Finkbeiner (R-Kirkland) is proposing a new
      option for commuters, giving them more ways to navigate the daily
      traffic crunch.  Through new legislation, certain motorists would be
      able to buy their way into the HOV lanes.

      Senate Bill 6569 would give the Department of Transportation the
      ability to create “green lanes” on Washington’s highways.  The bill
      would allow the DOT to expand current HOV lanes, allowing drivers of
      fuel-efficient vehicles access to the lanes, for a fee.  Newly
      constructed lanes could also be designated as “green lanes.”  The fees
      collected would go toward pollution control efforts and low-income
      transit subsidies throughout the state.

      Finkbeiner said the bill would not only give commuters more options,
      but help the environment as well.  “Drivers might be more inclined to
      purchase a fuel-efficient vehicle if they know it can save them some
      time on their commute,” Finkbeiner said.  “Plus it would take traffic
      out of the main lanes, as certain cars would start using the green
      lanes.”

      The fee for using the lane would be determined by the DOT.  A special
      green sticker on a driver’s license plate would designate “green”
      vehicles.  Vehicles using a green lane without the sticker could be
      cited for a traffic violation.

      “Our traffic in the Puget Sound area continues to rob many of us of
      time with friends and family,” Finkbeiner said.  “I think this bill
      might make your commute move a little faster.”

      Finkbeiner serves on the Senate Transportation Committee.
