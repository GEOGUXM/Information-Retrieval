   In ancient times, Greek philosophers observed two types of objects in
   the night sky. They distinguished between fixed stars and wandering
   stars. Today we understand that the wandering stars of the ancient
   Greeks are the planets in our own solar system.

                                                                   galileo

   In 1609, Galileo turned his newly invented telescope to the sky and
   learned more about these planets. He discovered the the four largest
   moons of Jupiter. He also observed mountains and valleys on the moon
   and found that the diffuse band of the Milky Way consisted of millions
   of individual stars.

   Edwin Hubble

   At the beginning of our century, Edwin Hubble, using what was then the
   largest telescope in the world atop of Mount Wilson, found that the
   small nebulae in the sky were neighboring islands of stars far outside
   our own galaxy. His later work revealed that the entire universe is
   expanding and that it had a beginning and might have an end.

   Today we are on the verge of taking another giant leap in capabilities,
   which will open new opportunities for discoveries. With the increase in
   precision pioneered by the Space Interferometry Mission, we will
   measure for the first time the positions of stars with microarcsecond
   accuracy. At this level we will see seemingly static stars perform
   their delicate dance.

   The apparent change in the position of a star due to the Earth's
   changing orbit around the Sun will yield accurate distances to objects
   throughout the Milky Way through parallax measurements. The more
   subtle, cyclic motions of stars will tell us about unseen companions as
   small as Earth-size planets. The enormous increase in precision in
   determining the dynamics, distances and, in turn, the luminosities of
   stars will advance all fields of modern astronomy. We are showcasing a
   few highlights here. Last but not least, the reference system of grid
   stars established by SIM will yield science results in its own right.
