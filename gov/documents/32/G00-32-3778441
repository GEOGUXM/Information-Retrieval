   ABSTRACT

   The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis extends from Jan 1948 to the present. The
   period prior to June 1957 presented a challenge to conventional
   techniques in that the primary rawindsondes launches were valid at 03
   and 15GMT, while surface data was collected at 00, 06, 12, and18GMT.
   Presumably in preparation for the International Geophysical Year of
   July 1957-June 1958 (IGY ), rawindsonde launches worldwide were
   advanced to 00 and 12GMT. In this paper the generalization of the
   assimilation system to accommodate the observation time dichotomy prior
   to June 1957 is described. Standard measures of prediction skill,
   hemispheric rms and anomaly correlation scores, are presented to
   measure the assimilation quality. In addition we examine the
   assimilated state and forecast verifications of two historic storms.
   Additional daily predictions were made to fill in between the routine
   every-fifth-day 192 hour predictions. In this paper two historic storms
   of the 1950's are presented: 1) the November 24-26, 1950 storm over the
   northeastern United States ; 2) the Jan 31-Feb 2, 1953 North Sea Gale
   that broke the dikes in Holland.

   Introduction

   The National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for
   Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR ) have cooperated in the Reanalysis
   Project described in detail in Kalnay et al (1996). The Project started
   in 1989 at NCEP (formerly known as the National Meteorological Center
   or NMC) with the initial goal of just building a "Climate Data
   Assimilation System" (CDAS) which would use a "frozen" system, and not
   be affected by the changes introduced by many improvements to the
   numerical weather prediction operational systems. (See Kalnay et al,
   1998 for a documentation of the changes in the NCEP operational systems
   from the 1950's to 1998).

   The CDAS Advisory Panel suggested in 1990 that CDAS would be much more
   useful if carried out in conjunction with a long-term reanalysis. NCEP
   contacted NCAR, which has developed a comprehensive archive of
   atmospheric and surface data, to explore the possibility of a joint
   project to perform a very long reanalysis. NCAR enthusiastically agreed
   and was also supportive of the idea of starting as far back as the
   International Geophysical Year ,1957-1958, ( IGY) and to gather the
   data to perform a long-term reanalysis using a frozen state-of-the-art
   system. The support of NOAA (the National Weather Service, NWS , and
   the Office of Global Programs, (OGP ) and of the National Science
   Foundation (NSF ) was essential to carrying out the project.

   The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis system was designed, developed and implemented
   during 1990-1994. The early design was discussed at the Reanalysis
   Workshop held at NCEP in April 1991 (Kalnay and Jenne, 1991). The
   reanalysis system required a completely different design from NCEP
   operations: the goal was to perform one month of reanalysis per day in
   order to carry out a 40-year reanalysis in just a few years. Several
   new systems which were developed for this project and later ported to
   NCEP operations, including a new BUFR archive designed to keep track of
   additional information about each observation ("meta data") and an
   advanced quality control (QC) system. The model was also upgraded, and
   was identical (except for having half the horizontal resolution) to the
   system that became operational on 25 January 1995. The most difficult
   task, made easier by the collaboration with NCAR, was to assimilate
   data that came from many different sources, with very different
   formats, and to quality control them (Woollen and Zhu, 1997 , Ebisuzaki
   et al, 1997, Kistler et al, 1997, Saha and Chelliah, 1993).

   The actual reanalysis started in June 1994. Although identical to the
   global system implemented operationally in January 1995, the
   operational system benefited from many errors found by the early
   reanalysis tests in the Global Data Assimilation System. The CDAS
   (performed 3-days after real time with a system identical to the
   reanalysis) became operational in 1995, and since then it has been
   extensively used for climate monitoring by the Climate Prediction
   Center (CPC) and many other groups. The period 1968-1996 was completed
   in early 1997. The reanalysis period 1957-1967, was started in July
   1997 and finished on 13 October 1997. This completed the 40 years
   originally planned. Following the latest recommendation of the Advisory
   Panel, the decade 1948-1957 was also reanalyzed during 1998, although
   these oldest data presented many additional problems, such as a
   different observing schedule and coverage primarily over NH land. This
   (combined with CDAS which extends it to the present) completes more
   than 50 years of reanalysis. There are two major products of the
   reanalysis. The first is the 4-dimensional gridded fields of the global
   atmosphere, the output most widely used by weather and climate
   researchers. It also includes 8-days "reforecasts" performed every 5
   days. The second major product is the Binary Universal Format
   Representation (BUFR) archive of the atmospheric and surface
   observations for the 5 decades of reanalysis . The BUFR archive now
   includes, for each observation, additional useful information about
   each observation, such as the value of the 6hr forecast, analysis, and
   a preliminary 7-year (1987-1993) climatology from the NCEP operational
   archives, collocated with each observation, as well as quality control
   decisions (meta data). In the process of preparation, and during the
   reanalysis, many errors were identified in the data archives, and many
   were corrected. This information, and the meta-data included in the
   BUFR archives, will be invaluable for carrying out improvements in the
   next phases of reanalysis.

   In this paper we emphasize results from the earliest decade of the 50
   years, 1948-1958, since it was completed following the November 1997
   First International Conference on Reanalyses, and, more importantly, it
   represents the pioneering first glimpse with modern NWP tools into the
   pre-NWP era. Much of the presentation is excerpted from the closure
   paper by Kistler, et.al.,(1999), that, if all goes as planned, is
   included on the NCEP/NCAR CDROM to be distributed at the conference.
   Other wise, the CDROM will accompany the published paper in BAMS , in
   similar fashion to Kalnay, et.al. (1996) and its companion CD_ROM .

   Analysis system

   The reanalysis system, described in more detail in Kalnay et al (1996)
   includes the NCEP global spectral model operational in 1995, with 28
   "sigma" vertical levels and a horizontal triangular truncation of 62
   waves, equivalent to about 210km. The analysis scheme is a
   3-dimensional variational (3D-Var) scheme cast in spectral space
   denoted Spectral Statistical Interpolation (Parrish and Derber, 1992).
   The assimilated observations are:

   · upper air rawinsonde observations of temperature, horizontal wind and
   specific humidity;

   · operational TOVS vertical temperature soundings from NOAA polar
   orbiters over ocean, with microwave retrievals excluded between 20N and
   20S due to rain contamination;

   · temperature soundings over land only above 100 hPa

   · cloud tracked winds from geostationary satellites;

   · aircraft observations of wind and temperature;

   · land surface reports of surface pressure, and

   · oceanic reports of surface pressure, temperature, horizontal wind and
   specific humidity.

   Evolution of the observing upper air network and impact on the
   reanalysis

   We can distinguish three major phases in the global upper air observing
   system: a) the early period, starting with the first upper air
   rawinsonde observations and ending with the (IGY ) of 1957-58; b) the
   "modern" global rawinsonde network established during the IGY and used
   almost exclusively until 1978; and c) the advent of a global
   operational satellite observing system starting in 1979 until the
   present.

   The NH rawinsonde observations had already been started by 1948. Good
   data coverage in China started in 1956, and in India by 1950. The
   world's upper air rawinsonde network of stations can be considered to
   be almost modern from June 1957-on, with the start of the IGY . Before
   the IGY there were no observations from most of South America and
   Antarctica, and although observations in Australia, New Zealand and
   parts of Africa and South America started earlier, the network was
   exceedingly inadequate in the SH. In the NH, the upper air observations
   for the early years actually had some advantages compared with present
   days. A number of permanent ships started observations in the late
   1940's and data at these locations continued in the northern oceans
   until about 1973-1974. After that the number of ships was greatly
   reduced. There were weather reconnaissance flights over the northern
   oceans and to the North Pole during 1947-1960. These, together with the
   permanent ship rawinsondes from 1948 to 1973 have helped the reanalysis
   over the oceans during the early years.

   Winds aloft from radar or visual tracking of balloons (called pilot
   balloons or pibals) are an important data source for reanalysis. For
   the early years, there are millions of these observations, especially
   in data set TD54 (see next subsection). There is considerable pibal
   data from Africa, South America, India, US, etc. Pibals for early years
   have come from sources like Brazil, Australia and France.

   Satellite cloud-tracked winds from geosynchronous satellites became
   operationally available for the Western Hemisphere in 1973-74; by the
   end of the 1970's they were available from European and Japanese
   satellites as well.

   The world's first satellite sounder data started in April 1969 on a
   polar orbiting satellite (SIRS-A, with 8 infrared channels). The
   NCEP/NCAR system started using vertical temperature soundings from an
   infrared instrument (VTPR) in the SH starting in March 1975. In 1979,
   with the First GARP Global Experiment (FGGE ), the TOVS (TIROS-N
   Operational Vertical Sounder) became the first combined
   infrared/microwave (HIRS/MSU) operational sounder. This instrument had
   a major positive impact in the forecasts in the SH, and continued to be
   used with little change until the recent implementation of an advanced
   microwave sounding unit (AMSU) in 1998. The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis uses
   the NESDIS temperature soundings from TOVS, although NCEP started using
   radiances directly in October 1996.


   Latitude/time distribution of data

   In order to provide the user with information about the data
   availability for different periods of the Reanalysis, we have prepared
   detailed monthly data density maps available at link from NCEP
   Reanalysis home page. Monthly summaries are also available on CD-ROM to
   be distributed, providing the number of observations every month in
   every 2.5 ^o latitude-longitude box for seven categories of
   observations.

   As a summary, Fig. 1 shows the zonal mean number of all types of
   observations as a twelve-month running mean from 1946 to 1998. Few
   observations were available before 1948, even in the Northern
   Hemisphere mid-latitudes. Increases near the equator and in the
   Southern Hemisphere sub-tropics in the 1950s reflect mostly increases
   in land surface synoptic reports. Increases in the late 1960s reflect
   increases in land surface synoptic reports, ocean ship reports,
   radiosondes and aircraft reports. Satellite winds became available in
   significant numbers in the mid-1970s, increased in number in the late
   1980s and increased further in 1998. Satellite temperatures we first
   available in 1972, first used in 1975, and in significant numbers in
   1979.

   The information on data distribution is very valuable in assessing the
   reliability of the reanalysis, as illustrated in the following example
   from a study by Brett Mullan of New Zealand's National Institute of
   Water and Atmosphere (pers. comm., 1999). The lower panel of Fig. 2
   (kindly provided by Dr. Mullan) traces 40 years of the difference of
   monthly mean sea level pressure of the reanalysis and that observed at
   Campbell Island (52.55S,169.15E). The upper panel shows monthly mean
   data counts of land surface reports from the New Zealand area (40-50S,
   106-175E) for the same period. The data count was computed from the
   reanalysis data counts web page
   http://wesley.wwb.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/disp_m_obscnt.sh , also available on
   the conference CD-ROM. Note that the large differences at Campbell
   Island between 1963 and 1967 during the years when only 5 surface
   observations per month from New Zealand were available to the NCEP/NCAR
   reanalysis.

   However, the data distribution alone does not take into account the
   ability of 4-dimensional data assimilation systems to transport
   information from data rich to data sparse regions. As a result, as will
   be shown by the forecast results in a subsequent section, the disparity
   between the quality of the reanalyses in the NH and those in the SH
   before the advent of satellite data in 1979 is considerably smaller
   than the data density alone would suggest.


   Observation changes in 1957 and the reanalysis for 1948-1957

   On June 1 1957, with the beginning of the International Geophysical
   Year ( IGY), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) made several
   major changes. This included shifting the upper air observing times
   from 03UTC, 09UTC, 15UTC and 21UTC to 00UTC, 06UTC, 12UTC, and 18UTC
   respectively, the same major synoptic times already used for the
   surface observations.

   Given this change, we decided to perform the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis at
   the observing times for upper air data for the period 1948-June 1957
   (03UTC, 09UTC, 15UTC, 21UTC). However, in order to facilitate user
   comparisons with the post-1957 reanalysis, the 3hr forecast fields at
   06UTC, 12UTC, 18UTC and 00UTC were also saved and diagnostic files were
   maintained at 06UTC, 12UTC, 18UTC and 00UTC for continuity with the
   following 40 years of reanalysis. In order to maintain the philosophy
   of a constant data assimilation/forecast system throughout the
   reanalysis, no attempt was made to modify the forecast errors
   statistics used in the 3-dimensional variational data assimilation
   system (3D-Var) used in the Reanalysis (Parrish and Derber, 1992).
   Since the forecasts for this early stage are of poorer quality, this
   decision implies that in the pre 1958 period, the information from the
   data was not optimally extracted: the forecasts were given relatively
   more weight than optimal. When a long reanalysis is performed again,
   the information already gathered in the first reanalysis will allow to
   reconsider the pre-1958 period and estimate the forecast error
   covariances as they evolve with changes in the observing systems.


   Impact of changes in the observing systems

   As indicated in the previous section, there were two major changes in
   the observing systems in the last 50 years. The first one took place
   during the period 1948 - 1957, when the NH upper air network was
   gradually improved, and culminated in the International Geophysical
   Year of 1957-58. The NH network was relatively stable after that time,
   but the tropics and SH were very poorly observed. The second major
   addition took place with the First Global GARP (Global Atmospheric
   Research Project) Experiment (FGGE ), run from Dec 1978 - Nov 1979,
   which introduced several innovative observing systems relying on
   spacecraft sensing and communication to provide unprecedented global
   observation coverage and timely data receipt. Although satellite
   cloud-tracked winds were introduced in the early 1970's, and VTPR
   temperature soundings in 1975, the global observing system with the
   more advanced TOVS sounder was consolidated during FGGE. During and
   after FGGE, many satellite data impact tests were executed, and
   generally reported strongly positive results in the Southern
   Hemisphere, but little impact in the Northern Hemisphere. (See Mo et
   al., 1995 for a summary.)

   Impact of the evolving observing systems on the forecasts

   As indicated in the introduction, we have carried out 8-day forecasts
   every 5 days as part of the reanalysis. Fig. 3 and Fig 4 show the
   annual average of the rms difference between the forecasts and the
   verifying analyses, for days 1 to 8, in the NH and SH, respectively.
   The impact of the observing systems and data processing in the NH is
   clearer in the shorter forecasts (days 1-3) which are less sensitive to
   the influence of variations in atmospheric predictability. We can
   distinguish several stages in the observing systems: From 1948 through
   1957 there is a continuous improvement in the forecasts, as the upper
   air network was being established. From 1958 through 1972, there is a
   plateau in the forecast skill. In 1973 there is a large improvement
   apparently associated with the WMO format change and the ON29 format
   established at NMC discussed in Section 3 (recall that these forecasts
   include the effect of the reanalysis QC, including Complex QC of
   rawinsonde heights and temperatures and OIQC of all data). In contrast,
   the 500 hPa S1 scores for the 36 hr operational forecasts, which did
   not include the Reanalysis QC, indicate a drop in the operational
   forecast skill in 1973-75 (Kalnay et al, 1998). The impact of more
   recent improvements in the observing systems is more gradual and rather
   small. In the winter scores (not shown) there is a very significant
   increase in skill in the NH after FGGE for the forecast range 3 days
   and beyond. This can be attributed to positive satellite data impact on
   oceanic analyses, with the downstream effects taking several days to
   have an influence.

   Fig. 5 shows the annually averaged 5-day anomaly correlation (AC) for
   the 50 years of reanalysis forecasts (full lines), as well as the
   operational scores (dashed lines) which are available only for the last
   decade. A level of AC of 60%, considered to be a threshold for useful
   skill, is also indicated in the plot. As in the rms error plot, there
   is a rapid improvement in the reanalysis AC in the NH in the period
   1948-1957, and a large improvement with the changes made in 1973. It is
   remarkable that 5-day skillful "reforecasts" were possible with the
   upper air data of the mid-1950's, a level attained operationally at
   NCEP in the mid-1980's. The impact of the higher horizontal resolution
   of the operational system (T126 operational vs. T62 in the reanalysis)
   is apparent starting in 1991. The largest operational improvement
   apparent during 1996 and 1997 (compared to the reanalysis) is probably
   mostly due to the direct use of TOVS radiances, replacing the
   operational NESDIS retrievals used still in the reanalysis (Derber and
   Wu, 1998 ).

   Fig. 5 also shows that in the SH, the impact of improvements in the
   observing systems is much clearer than in the NH. In the Reanalysis the
   AC for the 5-day forecasts increases from less than 50% before the
   advent of satellite data to well over 60%. The impact that the
   continuous improvement of NESDIS TOVS retrievals had on the SH
   forecasts is also very apparent. The AC for the period before 1958 is
   shaded to emphasize that this period is less reliable because of the
   change in observing schedule, the lack of observations in the SH, and
   the less than optimal analysis. In the NH a much lower AC reflects
   these factors in the earliest period. In the SH, the very high AC is
   spurious, simply reflecting the fact that, without data, as shown
   clearly by Fig 1, the analysis is essentially given by the forecast.

   Storm of November 1950

   Near the top of the list of candidates for "Storm of the Century" over
   the United States would be the storm of November 25-27, 1950 (Smith,
   1950, Bristor,1951). The storm caused widespread East Coast flooding
   and wind damage, while further inland record snowfalls and minimum
   temperatures were observed during its rampage over the northeastern
   United States. (Author Kistler was an eye-witness as a young boy on
   what was normally a simple commute between Northern New Jersey and New
   York City on Saturday morning, Nov. 25.) In the years following the
   storm, it served as a case study by the pioneers in numerical weather
   prediction (e.g. Phillips, 1958).

   During the routine execution of the reanalysis, 8-day predictions were
   initiated at five-day intervals . Fortuitously for this case, a
   prediction was initiated from 0300 GMT 22 Nov 1950, thereby permitting
   an examination of modern medium range skill in the pre-NWP era. The
   initial conditions, Fig 6, depict a weak cyclonic wave over Minnesota,
   along the leading edge of a very cold air mass over southwestern
   Canada. Over the course of the next 5 days, the record breaking cold
   air moved southeastward, eventually spawning a coastal "bomb" that
   retrograded back to the lower Great Lakes underneath a deep closed
   vortex.

   We present 3 panel depictions of the verifying analyses and 96-hour
   prediction , Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, respectively. While the prediction
   evolved a strong East Coast cyclone development underneath closed
   vortices at 500 and 850 hPa, it lacked the details of depth and
   location of the actual storm. It was still, overall, an excellent
   medium range prediction, whereas it was originally missed even in the
   short-range forecasts. Note that the hemispheric position of major
   troughs and ridges is also fairly accurate, as indicated by the fact
   that the hemispheric anomaly correlation for the prediction is 0.76.

   A series of twice daily prediction was for run for the full 8-day lead
   time for this storm. Phillips (pers. comm) is reviewing the predictions
   and plans to present the results in a invited paper at the "Symposium
   50th Anniversary of Numerical Weather Prediction" in Potsdam, Germany,
   in March 2000. The set of forecasts may be viewed at
   http://lnx21.wwb.noaa.gov/images/storm_nov_1950/

   1953 North Sea Gale

   Colleague Hugh van den Dool was imperiled as a youth by the flooding of
   the Netherlands by the storm of Jan. 31-Feb. 2, 1953 as the dikes were
   breached. At his request, we ran daily forecasts to fill in the period
   between the regular operative predictions of Jan. 26 and Jan. 31. A set
   of maps for this period may be viewed here.
