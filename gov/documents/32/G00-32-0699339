   Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics

LHEA Mission Statement

     * To increase the knowledge and understanding of space science,
       particularly in relation to the dynamic, evolutionary astrophysical
       process to which high energy astrophysics relates most directly.
     * To provide leadership in the development and scientific direction
       of new high energy astrophysics projects as representatives of the
       high energy astrophysics community.
     * To develop increasingly more capable instrumentation for
       observation and to disseminate the new technology developed
     * To pursue excellence in scientific research by making appropriate
       high energy astrophysics observations, interpreting the findings,
       and pursuing advanced theoretical research.
     * To communicate the scientific results of high energy astrophysics
       research to the scientific community and outreach to the public in
       meaningful ways.
     * To make high energy astrophysics data available to the astrophysics
       community in a useful form.
     * To contribute to education by
         1. providing an opportunity for graduate students in physics and
            astronomy to pursue Ph.D. research,
         2. providing summer and other on-site work experiences,
         3. developing WWW educational materials and learning experiences,
         4. providing speakers for public meetings and
         5. cooperating with educational institutions to develop materials
            for use in schools at all levels.
     * To provide the high energy astrophysics community with the
       continuity of a long-term steady core of scientific and technical
       involvement needed for major mission-oriented objectives.
