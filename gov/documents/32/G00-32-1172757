   Experimental Predictions

   Please note that these predictions are experimental and are produced
   for research purposes only. Use of these forecasts for purposes other
   than research is not recommended.

     NSIPP runs its fully coupled global ocean-atmosphere-land model to
   produce 12-month forecasts of the coupled system. These forecasts are
   referred to as Tier 1 forecasts, and a more detailed description can be
   found by clicking here.

   NSIPP also runs an ensemble of its coupled land-atmosphere model with
   prescribed sea surface temperatures. These forecasts are referred to as
   Tier 2 forecasts.
