   Large unmanned helium balloons provide NASA with an inexpensive means
   to place payloads into a space environment. The unique capabilities of
   this program are crucial for the development of new technologies and
   payloads for NASA's space flight missions. Many important scientific
   observations in fields such as hard x-ray/gamma-ray and infra-red
   astronomy, cosmic rays and atmospheric studies have been made from
   balloons. The newly developed capability for long duration ballooning
   has greatly expanded the opportunities for scientific studies from
   balloons.

   The launch support is provided by the National Scientific Balloon
   Facility in Palestine, Texas. NSBF is a government owned, contractor
   operated facility. The contact is administered by Goddard Space Flight
   Center's Wallops Flight Facility. WFF also operates the balloon
   research and development program. The contractor is the Physical
   Science Laboratory of New Mexico State University at Las Cruces. The
   user community is represented by the Balloon Project Scientist and the
   Balloon Working Group. This facility supports balloon launches on-site
   and remote operations. (Ft. Sumner, NM; Alice Springs, Australia;
   Antarctica; and Lynn Lake, Canada are recent examples.)

   Message from the NASA Chief Scientist
   From Science in Air and Space: NASA's Science Policy Guide
   The suborbital program of sounding rockets and stratospheric research
   balloons offers a special opportunity for rapid and low cost access to
   space. By providing inexpensive and readily available platforms to test
   new technologies, suborbital flights have played and continue to play a
   crucial role in the development and testing of instruments that
   ultimately lead to experiments on space missions. They have broadened
   opportunities for participation in space research particularly by
   university research groups. Since experiments can be brought from
   conception to flight in very short times, the suborbital programs have
   also provided a valuable training ground for the students who will go
   on to become the next generation of scientific leaders--a special
   aspect of these programs which will be considered carefully in
   assessing their future. Aircraft-based research programs offer similar
   opportunities for instrument development and testing and for the
   training of students as well as for carrying out important scientific
   programs that complement and support the flight missions. The Agency
   reaffirms its commitment to the support of these programs; they are
   central to the Agency's ability to carry out its Mission.
