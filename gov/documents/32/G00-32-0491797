   WebFile Sales Tax
   Qualified taxpayers may file their no-tax-due Texas sales tax return
   online. The Comptroller of Public Accounts is extending the current
   webFile application (Sales Tax no-tax-due filings) to provide taxpayers
   the ability to file Sales Tax short form returns with tax due and make
   their payment using a credit card or electronic checking. The user will
   enter the primary tax return data and the application will calculate
   the amount subject to tax and tax due.
