   this Court to establish practices and procedures for the filing,
   signing and verification of documents by electronic means; and WHEREAS,
   by General Order #M-182, dated June 26, 1997, as amended by the First
   Amendment to General Order #M-182, dated May 1, 1998, and the Second
   Amendment to General Order #M-182, dated July 13, 1999, the Court
   established such practices and procedures; and WHEREAS, a proposal for
   Revised Administrative Procedures for Filing, Signing and Verifying
   Documents by Electronic Means and Revised Electronic Filing System
   User's Manual (collectively, the "Revised Electronic Filing
   Procedures") have been reviewed by the Court; and WHEREAS, the Revised
   Electronic Filing Procedures are consistent with and further the
   responsibility of the Clerk of the Court for the control of the Court's
   docket under FRBP 5003 and 5005, including safeguarding the integrity
   of the Court's docket; and WHEREAS, the Revised Electronic Filing
   Procedures do not impose fees inconsistent with the present fee
   structure adopted by the Judicial Conference of the United States
   pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1913, 1914, 1926 and 1930; and WHEREAS, the
   Revised Electronic Filing Procedures provide a means for the signature
   on documents through the mechanism of a password, in compliance with
   the Local Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure ("LRBP") 9011-1(b) and
   9011-1(c), and a secure mechanism for the creation and distribution of
   passwords; and WHEREAS, the Revised Electronic Filing Procedures
   provide adequate procedures for the filing, review and retrieval of
   documents by parties who are not able to access the Electronic Filing
   System (the "System") from a remote location; and WHEREAS, the Revised
   Electronic Filing Procedures do not impair the ability of the Clerk of
   the Court to perform statistical reporting responsibilities both to the

   WHEREAS, the Revised Electronic Filing Procedures are consistent with
   the notice requirements of FRBP 2002: NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED

   shall knowingly permit or cause to permit the attorney's password to be
   utilized by anyone other than an authorized member or employee of the
   attorney's law firm. 4. The use of an attorney's password to file a
   document electronically shall constitute the signature of that attorney

   THE ELECTRONIC FILING SYSTEM A. Passwords. Each attorney admitted to
   practice in this Court shall be entitled to one System password to
   permit the attorney to participate in the electronic retrieval and
   filing of documents in accordance with the System. Registration for a
   password is governed by paragraph I.B. B. Registration. 1. A
   registration form, in the form attached, shall be submitted for each
   attorney. A duplicate copy of the attached form may be used. 2. All
   registration forms shall be mailed or delivered to the Office of the
   Clerk, United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York,
   One Bowling Green, New York, New York 10004-1408, Attn: Electronic Case
   Filing System Registration. 3. Each attorney registering for the System
   will receive an envelope, clearly marked "Personal and Confidential,"
   and containing the attorney's assigned System -1- password from the
   Office of the Clerk. Any attorney may request an alternative means for
   receiving a password by telephoning the Office of the Clerk to arrange
   for retrieval of the attorney's password. 4. Attorneys may find it
   desirable to change their Court assigned passwords periodically. This
   can be done by contacting the Office of the Clerk, Systems Department,
   Technical Help Desk at (212) 668-2870, ext. 3522. In the event an
   attorney believes that the security of an existing password has been
   compromised and a threat to the System exists, the attorney shall give
   immediate telephonic notice to the Clerk of Court, Chief Deputy Clerk
   or Systems Department Manager, confirmed by facsimile, to prevent
   access to the System by use of that password. II. ELECTRONIC FILING AND
   SERVICE OF DOCUMENTS A. Filing. 1. Except as expressly provided in
   paragraph III, below, all motions, pleadings, memoranda of law, or

   documents that form part of the motion or pleading and which are being
   filed at the same time and by the same party may be electronically
   filed together under one docket number, e.g., the motion and a
   supporting affidavit, with the exception of a memorandum of law. A
   memorandum of law must be filed separately and shown as a related
   document to the motion. 3. Persons filing documents that reference
   exhibits not prepared in electronically produced text shall scan and
   electronically file only excerpts of the exhibits that are directly

   complete exhibit must be made available forthwith to counsel and the
   Court on request (and must be available in the Courtroom at any hearing
   pertaining to the matter). Persons filing excerpts of the exhibits
   pursuant to these Revised Electronic Filing Procedures do so without
   prejudice to their right to file additional excerpts or the complete
   exhibit with the Court at any time. Opposing parties may file
   additional excerpts if they believe that they -3- are germane. 4. Title
   of Docket Entries. The person electronically filing a document is
   responsible for designating a title for the document using one of the
   main categories provided in the system, e.g., motion, application, etc.
   5. Fees Payable to the Clerk. An application for authorization to pay
   filing fees by credit card may be made with the financial officer of
   the Office of the Clerk. B. Service. 1. General Rule: Except as
   otherwise provided in the next paragraph, all documents required to be
   served shall be served in paper (i.e., "hard copy") form in the manner
   mandated by the applicable law and rules. 2. Consent to Electronic
   Service: Whenever service is required to be made on a person who has
   requested, or is deemed to have requested, electronic notice in

   impracticable. 3. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, conventional
   service of documents in hard copy shall be required in the following
   circumstances: (a) Service is required to be made in accordance with
   FRCP 4, FRCP 45, FRBP 7004 or FRBP 9016. (b) The FRBP, LRBP or an order
   of the Court requires delivery or service upon an agency of the United
   States, including the United States Attorney, the United States
   Trustee, or chambers. (c) Notice is required under FRBP 2002(a)(1). (d)
   The attorneys for the debtor, or the debtor pro se, shall upon the
   commencement of a case, serve the petition, schedules and statement of
   affairs on the United States Trustee and the trustee assigned to the
   case. 4. Orders. All signed orders (including, without limitation,
   orders to show cause) shall be filed electronic- -5- ally by the Court.

   social security number of the attorney signing such pleading or other
   document. Additionally, the electronically filed document shall
   indicate an "electronic signature," e.g., "s/Jane Doe". 2. Petitions,
   lists, schedules, statements, amendments, pleadings, affidavits,
   stipulations and other documents which must contain original
   signatures, documents requiring verification under FRBP 1008, and
   unsworn -6- declarations under 28 U.S.C. § 1746, shall be filed
   electronically and bear "electronic signatures." The hard copy of the
   originally executed document shall be maintained by the filer for the
   later of two years or the entry of a final order terminating the case
   or proceeding to which the document relates. III. DOCUMENTS FILED UNDER
   SEAL A. Motion. A motion to file documents under seal (but not the
   documents themselves) shall be filed electronically. If the motion
   itself contains confidential information, the movant shall serve and

   docket sheet and documents in a "read only" format. With the
   introduction of an updated version of the System, "Verson 1", a
   password obtained from the Public Access to Electronic Court Records
   Center ("PACER") will be required by all users of the System. (See D.
   below and the Court's web site for further information.) Information
   posted on the System shall not be downloaded for uses inconsistent with
   the privacy concerns of debtors and third parties. B. Access at the
   Court. Access to the documents filed on the System and to the System

   Netscape software to perform the following functions: Ç Access the
   Court's web page Ç Download the most recent version of the Attorney's
   User's Manual Ç Train personnel on a training system comparable to the
   official "live" system Ç Electronically file pleadings and documents in
   actual ("live") cases Ç View official docket sheets and documents
   associated with cases Ç View various reports (e.g., Cases Filed Report,
   Professional Fees Report, Judge's Calendar (for cases administered on
   the court's electronic filing system only.) 1 Ç Download Netscape
   Browser and Portable Document Format (PDF) configuration information Ç
   Submit comments and questions regarding the system B. REQUIREMENTS 1.
   Hardware and Software Requirements The hardware and software needed to
   electronically file, view and retrieve case documents are the
   following: Ç a personal computer running a standard platform such as
   Windows Ç Windows 95 or Macintosh Ç an Internet provider. It is
   recommended that the provider is capable of giving a connection speed
   of 56kps minimum. Note: Connection can be made at speeds less that the
   recommended 56kps, however system performance may be less that optimal
   i.e. slow response time and access. Ç Netscape Navigator software
   version 3.0 or higher* Ç Adobe Acrobat software to convert documents
   from a word processor format to portable document format (PDF). Ç a
   scanner to transmit documents that are not in your word processing
   system Note: For additional information and known problems, refer to
   Technical Notes (Appendix I). * Due to security, a session can only be
   established using Netscape Navigator 3.0 or higher. DO NOT USE America
   On Line's browser, Internet Explorer, or a version of Netscape
   Navigator lower than 3.0. 2. How to Register for Access Participants
   who have never used the system must telephone the court's Technical
   Help Desk at (212) 668-2870 Ext. 3522 to obtain a registration form if
   the participant has not already obtained one and to discuss the
   system's technical requirements. To sign up for the court's training
   program, call (212) 668- 2870 Ext. 3580. The completed registration
   form must be returned to the Bankruptcy Court Clerk's Office, One
   Bowling Green, Room 534, New York, NY 10004-1408, for processing. Only
   after a user account has been established based on the registration
   form, is the participant issued a login and password for access to the
   system. A training version of the system is provided on the Internet at
   http://www.nysb.uscourts.gov for practice purposes and may be used
   prior to submission of a registration 2 form. Please make use of the
   training version to acquaint yourself with the system before attempting
   to file an actual document. Note: A different set of logins and
   passwords are issued for the training and live systems. Only attorneys
   are issued passwords to the live system. C. PREPARATION 1. Setting Up
   the Acrobat PDF Reader In order to view documents filed on the system,
   users must set up an Acrobat PDF reader. All pleadings are in PDF
   format. When installing this product, please review and follow Adobe's
   directions to utilize an Acrobat PDF reader after installation: Ç At
   the system login screen select the "Options" pull down menu item from
   the top of the screen. Ç Select the "General Preferences" option. Ç
   Click on the "Helpers" tab at the top of the "Preferences" screen. A
   list of "File Types" appears. Ç Select the "application/PDF" file type.
   Ç Click on the "Browse" button and select a directory called
   "acroread". Ç Within that directory is a file name called
   "acroread.exe." Select it and click on the "OK" button to exit. The
   setup process is now complete. 2. Portable Document Format (PDF) Only
   PDF (Portable Document Format) documents can be filed with the court
   using the court's Electronic Filing System. Be sure to view the PDF
   formatted document before sending it to ensure that it appears in its
   entirety and in the proper format (refer to Technical Notes in Appendix
   I for known problems) . To accomplish this you must have Adobe
   Exchange. a. How to View a PDF File ó Start the Adobe Acrobat Exchange
   program. ó Go to the File menu and choose Open. 3 ó Click on the
   location and file name of the document to be viewed. ó If the
   designated location is correct, and the file is in PDF format, Adobe
   Acrobat Exchange loads the file and displays it on the screen. ó If the
   displayed document is larger than the screen or consists of multiple
   pages, use the scroll bars to move through the document. ó Click on the
   View menu for other options for viewing the displayed document. Choose
   the option that is most appropriate for the document. b. How to Convert
   Documents to PDF Format Conversion of any word processing document to
   PDF Format is required before submission to the court's electronic
   filing system. To accomplish this you must have Adobe Exchange. The
   conversion process is relatively simple and can be accomplished in one
   of two ways depending on the word processing program you are using. For
   WordPerfect and any other word processing program: ó Open the document
   to be converted. ó Select the Print option and in the dialog box select
   the option to change the selected printer. A drop down menu with a list
   of printer choices is displayed. ó Select Adobe PDFWriter 3.x. ó
   "Print" the file. The file should not actually print out; instead the
   option to save the file as a PDF format file appears. ó Name the file,
   giving it the extension .PDF . ó Accept the option and the file is
   converted to a PDF document. 4 Depending on the word processing program
   being used, it may be necessary to find the printer selection option
   elsewhere. At that point, change the printer to Adobe PDFWriter. 3.x,
   and follow the directions above. For Microsoft Word 95 or later: ó Open
   the document. ó Click on the File menu and select, Create Adobe PDF. ó
   Save the file as a PDF file, giving it a .PDF extension. ó The file is
   now in Adobe PDF format under the newly designated name, and the
   original document remains in its original form under the original name.
   c. How to Image a Document To image or scan a document using Adobe
   Acrobat Exchange: ó Open the Acrobat Exchange program. ó Click on the
   File menu and select Scan. ó A screen appears prompting you to specify
   the type of document to be imaged. Depending on the scanner, one or
   more of the following options will be available: Single-sided page (one
   page only) Single-sided stack (multiple pages) Double-sided page (one
   page only) Double-sided stack (multiple pages) ó Refer to the scanner's
   instruction manual for more detailed operating instructions and
   insertion of procedures for document(s) to be scanned. Click on the
   appropriate option on the screen to begin the scanning process. 5 ó
   When the imaging process is complete, the imaged document is displayed
   on screen. Verify that the document contains the correct number of
   pages. ó If the entire document is lopsided or otherwise unacceptable,
   close it WITHOUT saving it, and begin the scanning process again. If
   only part of the document is unacceptable, the individual pages can be
   re-scanned and used to replace the unacceptable pages. ó Once a
   document is satisfactorily scanned, save the imaged document to the
   hard drive or a floppy disk as a PDF file. Make a note where the file
   is stored for future access. ó The imaged document can now be
   electronically filed, or edited and mixed with other PDF files, as
   needed. d. How to Edit and Combine Text and Image PDF Files PDF files
   can be edited and mixed using the Adobe Acrobat Exchange program. With
   Acrobat Exchange you can extract, insert, replace, re-order or delete
   whole pages from a document. Acrobat Exchange DOES NOT allow editing of
   the contents of a given page. ó Start the Acrobat Exchange program and
   open the file to be edited. ó Click on the Document menu. Four (4)
   options are displayed that allow editing and combining of PDF files: 1)
   Insert: Allows insertion of pages from other documents into the
   document currently displayed. 2) Extract: Allows removal of pages from
   the document that is currently displayed. 3) Replace: Allows
   replacement of pages in the currently displayed document with pages
   from other PDF files. 4) Delete: Allows you to delete selected pages
   from the document currently displayed. 1) The Insert option: 6 ó
   Choosing the Insert option displays a file selection screen. ó Select
   the PDF file to be inserted into the document currently displayed.
   (Note: The ENTIRE file will be inserted into the open document). ó
   Indicate whether the new document is to be inserted before or after a
   specific page of the original displayed document. - Indicate the page
   of the original displayed document to be inserted in new document will
   be inserted. The new document can then be inserted either before or
   after the page indicated in the original document. ó Indicate first or
   last page, or a page number. 2) The Extract option: ó Choosing the
   Extract option displays a screen that prompts you to designate the
   page(s) to be extracted from the document currently displayed. It
   further gives the option of deleting a page after it has been
   extracted. When pages are extracted from a document, a new document
   window appears which displays the extracted page(s). This document is
   temporarily titled, "Pages extracted from ". ó To go back and forth
   between the original displayed document and the document containing the
   extracted pages, click on the Window menu, and select the document you
   want to view. ó The extracted page(s) can be saved as a new document,
   and the original document can be saved with the changes made, by
   following the usual procedure for saving a document. 3) The Replace
   Option: ó Choosing the Replace option brings up a file selection
   screen. 7 ó Choose the PDF file in which the pages are to be replaced
   (the target document). ó In the next screen, designate which page(s)
   are to be replaced in the target document. (To designate a single page,
   the From and To number should both be the number of the page to be
   replaced). ó Choose the PDF file from which you will select the
   replacement pages (the replacement document). ó Designate the page(s)
   that will replace those in the target document. Note: the number of
   pages being replaced in the target document must match the number of
   pages being brought in from the replacement document. ó Click on
   Accept, and the pages in the target document will be replaced with
   those from the replacement document. 4) The Delete Option: ó Choosing
   the Delete option displays a screen that prompts you to designate a
   range of pages to be deleted from the displayed document. ó Designate
   the pages to be deleted, click on Accept, and the selected page(s) will
   be deleted from the displayed document. There are many ways to edit and
   combine documents using the above four commands. For example, to
   combine two files, one can be inserted at the end of another, and then
   any unwanted pages can be deleted. Or, needed pages can be extracted
   from one file, saved as a new file, and inserted into another file. The
   combined file can then be saved as a new document leaving the originals
   intact. If you get an undesired result, simply close the document,
   WITHOUT saving the changes made, and start over by reloading the
   document. D. BASICS 1. User Interactions 8 There are three general
   types of user interactions allowed by the system: entering data, using
   command buttons to tell the system what to do next, and clicking on
   hyperlinks. Command buttons and hyperlinks are used to instruct the
   system what to do next. Ç Data to be entered by the user is shown
   enclosed in angle brackets: . Ç Command buttons are represented in this
   manual in [bracketed boldface type]. Ç Hyperlinks are represented in
   underlined boldface type, and if your monitor is a color monitor, they
   appear in blue type. (Note: the most commonly used hyperlink, Main
   Menu, appears near the top of most screens just below the Netscape menu
   buttons.) 2. Documents Filed in Error A document incorrectly filed in a
   case may be the result of posting the wrong PDF file to a docket entry,
   or selecting the wrong document type from the menu, or simply entering

   the Treasury, through its Financial Management Service (FMS), has
   established a mechanism to enable federal agencies to accept credit
   cards (Visa, American Express, MasterCard, and Discover card only) for
   the collection of fees due to the government. This court has elected to
   participate in this program, which enables the court to collect fees in
   the most expeditious manner for documents filed both electronically and
   conventionally. A lawyer or law firm electronically filing a document
   requiring a fee can pay such fee by credit card in advance of filing by
   calling (212) 668-2870, Ext. 3599. A receipt number will be issued to
   the filer for entry into the electronic filing system. (All other
   accepted methods of payment, cash, attorney's check or money order are
   still available. Payments must be made in advance of filing a document
   utilizing the court's electronic filing system. A receipt number is
   needed in order to file a document requiring a fee.) Do not call to pay
   the filing fee until you are ready to file your document. Once a
   receipt number is issued, the document must be filed before the start
   of the next business day (e.g., if the fee is paid on Tuesday, the
   document must be filed before 8:30 A.M., Wednesday; if the fee is paid
   on Friday, the document must be filed before 8:30 A.M.. Monday. To take
   advantage of this method of payment, the card collection network
   authorization from must be filled out, signed and submitted it to the
   Clerk's Office. Below is the credit card collection network form. Sign
   and submit it to USBC-SDNY, One Bowling Green, New York, NY 10004-1408.
   You should also have this information. Please have the required
   information on the following page readily available when telephoning
   Intake. (It is anticipated that, eventually, the telephone call will be
   eliminated and the entire fee transaction will be electronic.) 10

   PUBLIC CASE INFORMATION The next screen is the cases filed screen
   (Exhibit 3). 13 D. FILE A DOCUMENT FEATURE This option permits the
   filing of documents in a case. There are four basic steps involved in
   filing a document: (1) selecting a document type; (2) entering the case
   number for which the document is to be filed; (3) designating the
   parties filing the document; and (4) specifying the PDF file name for
   the document to be filed. Note: Pursuant to Local Bankruptcy Rule
   9070-1, a copy of all papers filed with the Court, other than proofs of
   claim, shall be marked "Chambers Copy" and delivered to the chambers of
   the assigned Judge on the same date as the papers are filed with the
   Clerk. For cases filed electronically, this requirement can be met by
   delivering or mailing a paper copy of the electronically filed document
   directly to the chambers of the assigned judge. Please clearly mark
   such copy "Chambers Copy-ECF Doc. #" and attach a copy of the
   electronic case filing receipt. Each screen has the following buttons:
   Ç [Clear] clears all characters entered in that particular box. Ç
   [Submit] or [Next] accepts the entry just made and displays the next
   entry screen, if any. Ç Other buttons will be indicated by bold words
   in brackets, for example [Accept]. CORRECTING A MISTAKE: Use the BACK
   button on the Netscape screen to go back and correct an entry made on a
   previous screen. Once a correction has been made you must re-enter all
   information and resubmit from that page forward. You can not USE the
   BACK button, correct a mistake and then use the FORWARD button. You
   must re-enter and resubmit all information forward from the page that
   you have made the correction. However, once the document is transmitted
   to the court, only the court can make changes or corrections. NOTE: The
   ë symbol indicates a new screen. 1. Filing a Petition This feature is
   not in final form at this time. Currently, a petition is filed
   conventionally. In certain emergencies the court will make exceptions
   and permit a petition commencing a case to be filed electronically. If
   such permission is granted, please call the Technical Help Desk at
   (212) 668- 2870, Ext. 3522 for assistance. After a petition is filed
   electronically, the court will designate the bankruptcy judge to whom
   the case is assigned and advise you. Electronic filing of a petition
   requires the filer: (1) to submit a creditor disk to the court for
   noticing purposes 17 (2) immediately after electronically filing a
   petition, provide paper copies with the case number and the name of the
   judge assigned to: Ç United States Trustee 33 Whitehall Street New
   York, NY 10004 Ç Internal Revenue Service 120 Church Street, 3rd floor

   U.S. Bankruptcy Court One Bowling Green New York, NY 10004-1408 United
   States Attorney One St. Andrew's Plaza New York, New York 10007 a.
   Preparing a Creditor Disk When submitting a creditor disk, please
   follow the guidelines below. This will help insure the disk can be
   properly processed by the court: ó The name and address of each
   creditor must be four (4) lines or less; and each line should be thirty
   (30) characters or less, including spaces. ó Leave at least two (2)
   blank lines between creditors. ó Names and addresses should be left
   justified (flush against the left margin). ó Use all capital letters. ó
   Finally, and most importantly, save the file as an ASCII text file. 18
   ASCII (pronounced Ask-Key) stands for American Standard Code for
   Information Interchange. To save a file as an ASCII text file: ó Save
   the document in a word processing program, and look for a prompt to
   select the format in which it will be saved (e.g., Save as Type: (or
   something similar)). ó Select the option that saves the document as an
   ASCII text file (or ASCII (DOS) text, or MS-DOS text). ó If there is a
   choice between with carriage returns or stripped, choose stripped ó
   Name the file: creditor.scn Example: JOHN Q. PUBLIC, DEBTOR EDWARD

   Note: When submitting a motion, application or notice of proposed order
   electronically, the proposed order must be submitted on paper to the
   judge's chambers either prior to or at the time of the hearing or

   case filing receipt. A disk containing the proposed order only in the
   WordPerfect format must be submitted to chambers together with the
   paper copy of the proposed order. Write directly on a label on the
   disk, the case number and the number of the motion, application or
   notice of proposed order to which the order on the disk relates. ë <

   being requested in the motion or application, press and hold down the
   Ctrl key, and click on the appropriate forms of relief sought. (As with
   conventional filing, if one type of relief sought requires payment of a
   fee, combining that relief with other requests does not obviate the fee
   requirement and the fee is required for each relief sought which
   requires a fee.) < Scroll down and click on [Next]. ë< The next screen
   prompts you to select the PDF filename of the document being filed. The
   file MUST be in a PDF format with a .PDF suffix. If not, it will not be

   the full path name of the document to be filed in the space provided;
   or, (b) click on the [Browse] button to navigate to the appropriate
   directory and file to select the document. Two very important points
   must be noted here: (1) If the path name for the file is manually
   entered, be sure to include the drive name, if applicable, and the full
   directory path (e.g. c:\docs\answr.PDF). (2) To use the [Browse]
   option, use the mouse to select the directory in which the PDF version

   If there are attachments, an additional screen is displayed (all
   exhibits must be attached to the motion, application or notice of
   proposed order). Note: If the attachments are voluminous, determine if
   submitting a summary or an extract of pertinent information is feasible
   or if everything is absolutely necessary for the motion, application or
   notice of proposed 23 order being filed. e.g. a copy of a document
   already filed in the electronic filing system can be referenced. It
   will automatically be hyperlinked. ë < Under Type of Attachment click

   number. Remember, if multiple reliefs are requested in the Motion, the
   appropriate filing fee must be paid for each - e.g., a motion to lift
   the stay and/or to convert a chapter 11 to a chapter 7 requires a
   $75.00 fee for the first and a $15.00 fee for the second. Note: Fees
   must be paid prior to electronically filing the document. For
   information on paying fees, see the section on filing fees in this
   manual. Note: Calendar dates MUST be cleared through the courtroom
   deputy for the judge assigned to the case. < Click on Response due date

   ScanJet IIc with optional sheet feeder SCSI card Adaptec AHA 1522B (ISA
   Plug and Play fast SCSI-2) Software: Adobe Acrobat - version 3.0 Stats:
   Pages per minute 3 file size - 30K (approximately) dots per inch - 200
   KNOWN PROBLEMS 1) Converting documents to PDF. If WordPerfect 5.1 or
   7.0 is used to write the document, and the document is more than three
   pages, Adobe Acrobat will not convert all pages to the PDF format. The
   converted document will have missing pages. Use Adobe Exchange to
   ensure the integrity of the converted PDF document. 2) Cannot login to
   the LIVE SYSTEM. A) A session can only be established using Netscape
   Navigator 3.0 or higher. DO NOT use America On Line's version of
   Netscape Navigator, or a version of Netscape Navigator lower then 3.0.
   32 B) Call the Court's Technical Help Desk at (212) 668-2870, Ext.
   3522. 3) To ensure the documents transmitted have arrived in their
   entirety, it is important to read the document after it is received by
   the court. This can be done by viewing the docket sheet for the case
   and selecting the transmitted document. The number of the transmitted
   document appears on your electronic filing receipt. 4) System seems
   slow and unresponsive. It is recommended that the Internet provider
   that is used is capable of giving a connection speed of 56kps minimum.
   Note: Connection can be made at speeds less that the recommended 56kps,
   however system performance may be less that optimal. i.e. slow response
   time and access. 33 United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District
