   Space Station Crew Returns to Regular Routine
   The Expedition Four crewmembers -- Commander Yury Onufrienko and Flight
   Engineers Carl Walz and Dan Bursch -- returned to a normal work routine
   Tuesday after spending a few days to wind down from last Friday's space
   walk. Among their regular activities is work with the International
   Space Station's science investigations.

   During last week's space walk, Onufrienko and Bursch installed six
   thruster deflector shields at the rear of the Zvezda Service Module and
   three materials experiments, replaced a device to measure material from
   the thrusters, and installed a physics experiment and a ham radio
   antenna. Onufrienko and Walz performed Expedition Four's first space
   walk Jan. 14.

   Astronauts Participate in Lung Experiment After Space Walks
   One day after conducting Expedition Four's first space walk, Flight
   Engineer Carl Walz participated in the Pulmonary Function in Flight, or
   Puff, experiment. Puff focuses on lung function both following EVA and
   inside the station during long-term exposure to microgravity, laying
   the groundwork for future experiments key to understanding and
   maintaining crew health. Flight Engineer Dan Bursch will participate in
   a Puff experiment on Jan. 26 -- one day after he performs a space walk.
   Walz will also participate in a monthly Puff session on Jan. 26. Each
   session includes five lung function tests to measure the evenness of
   gas exchange in the lungs and to detect changes in respiratory muscle
   strength, which may result from long periods in the absence of gravity.

   Expedition Four Crew to Perform Multiple Space Walks
   The Expedition Four crew is scheduled to perform multiple EVAs during
   its stay at the International Space Station. The first space walk
   occurred Jan. 14 and was conducted by Commander Yury Onufrienko and
   Flight Engineer Carl Walz. They relocated a Russian cargo boom to the
   Pirs Docking Compartment. Onufrienko and Flight Engineer Dan Bursch
   performed the second space walk on Jan. 25. Among the tasks for the
   second EVA was the installation of thruster deflector shields for the
   Zvezda Service Module. The first two space walks were based out of Pirs
   and performed in Russian Orlan spacesuits.

   A third space walk is tentatively slated to occur Feb. 20 based out of
   the Quest Airlock using U.S. suits. It would be conducted by Walz and
   Bursch. The objective of the space walk would be to revalidate Quest
   for use during four space walks planned during STS-110 and pre-position
   equipment for those space walks to install the S0 Truss.

Truss is the highlighted element.

   STS-110 Next Mission to Visit ISS
   The next set of visitors for the Expedition Four crew is slated to
   arrive in early April. Space Shuttle Atlantis and its seven astronauts
   will deliver the S0 Truss to the station during STS-110. The S0 will be
   the first segment of the station's truss that eventually will support,
   among other things, four solar wing assemblies. Canadarm2, the
   station's robot arm, will be used to attach the S0 to the station.
   Also, STS-110's four space walks will be dedicated to the truss
   installation. STS-110, which is also designated Flight 8A in the
   station assembly sequence, is scheduled to launch no earlier than April
   4.
