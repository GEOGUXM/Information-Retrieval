                       Near Live Comet Watching System

   [puckett2.jpg] This system was designed to allow individuals on the Web
   to view very recently uploaded images of comet Hale-Bopp. Hopefully, at
   any given time, someone on the night side of earth will be imaging
   Hale-Bopp and be able to upload images soon after obtaining them.
   Sequences such as an image every 5 or 10 minutes for the duration of an
   observing session would be great for observing changing events and
   measuring motion! This is what we are hoping for. If you have equipment
   capable of imaging the comet, you are welcome and encouraged to
   register as an "Uploader". Click on the "Register to upload images"
   link to the lower right and fill out the form. It would be greatly
   appreciated if observatories monitoring the comet would participate
   too. This system, if successful, could be used by other groups for
   other Astronomical purposes such as a "Mars Watch" program or the like.

   NOTE: The file upload part of this system requires that you use
   Netscape 2.0 (or newer). Sorry, but this file upload does not work with
   Microsoft Internet Explorer.
