   Landsat 5 to Continue Operations


   Reston VA. July 3, 2001. The U.S. Department of the Interiors U.S.
   Geological Survey (USGS), operator of the Landsat 7 earth-observing
   satellite launched by NASA in 1999, announced today that Landsat 5,
   launched in 1984 and recently scheduled for decommissioning, will
   continue to acquire images for at least several more months.

   Many Landsat data users contacted the USGS to register their concerns
   about the loss of back-up capability for Landsat 7 and the loss of
   eight-day imaging opportunities. Landsat 7 passes over a given spot on
   the earths surface every 16 days in an orbit that is offset eight days
   by Landsat 5, thus doubling chances to obtain critical cloud-free
   images of forest clear-cuts or fires, agricultural crops, floods,
   tornado swaths, urban sprawl, coastal erosion, etc.

   With the U.S. Department of Agriculture leading the effort, several
   large preliminary orders for Landsat 5 data were recently directed to
   the USGS from Federal agencies that rely heavily on Landsat data. This
   enabled the USGS to fund continued satellite flight operations through
   much of the northern hemispheres remaining growing season.

   Data users now have no restrictions on the use or redistribution of
   Landsat 5 products, as commercial marketing rights to current and
   historical Landsat data expired on July 1. Inquiries and orders can be
   entered at http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/.
