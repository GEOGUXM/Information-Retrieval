   COUNSEL Plaintiffs' Liaison Counsel (PLC) and Defendants' Liaison
   Counsel (DLC) jointly submit this Report No. 8. I. Master
   Complaint/Answer - (PTO 2 - VI(B)) On March 22, 2001 the PLC delivered
   to DLC a draft of the Plaintiffs Position Paper Regarding the filing of
   a Master Complaint and Answer. On May 15, 2001, DLC furnished to PLC a
   response to the plaintiffs position paper. The defendants response was
   circulated to the PSC. The parties will be prepared to discuss their
   respective positions at the June monthly status conference. II. Update
   of Rolling Document Production - (PTO 2 - IX) DLC advises that the next
   production of documents was rolled out on June 15, 2001, with a
   delivery of approximately 551,355 pages on CD-ROM. The documents to be
   produced at this time primarily include materials from Finance,
   Research & Development and Marketing. With this production the total
   number of pages produced on CD-ROM so far will be approximately
   2,768,207. The PSC is waiting for production of electronic data in
   accordance with Pre-Trial Order No. 10. Further, the parties are
   continuing discussions regarding a nominee for a Special Master as
   required by Section H-3 of PTO-10. III. Electronic Service/Verilaw -
   (PTO 2- IV(C)(C)) PSC and DSC has communicated with Verilaw concerning
   the security of documents filed under seal that are uploaded to Verilaw
   and served electronically. The parties have agreed to additional
   security measures requested by Verilaw for documents that are served
   electronically. It is anticipated that Verilaw will be implementing the
   update shortly. PLC and DLC will be prepared to report further
   developments from Verilaw at the July monthly status conference. IV.
   State Liaison Counsel - (Minute Entry, November 16, 2000) PLC is
   desirous of setting a date with the court for the State Liaison
   Committee to meet with your Honor. Members of the State Liaison
   Committee had a meeting on June 13, 2001 to discuss several items
   including further coordination of state cases with defense counsel,
   updates from state court cases so that the MDL can be apprized and
   setting regularly scheduled conference calls. PLC and the State Liaison
   Committee will be prepared to discuss this item at the June monthly
   status conference. V. 30(b)(6) Deposition Regarding Corporate
   Organization The 30(b)(6) deposition of the Beerse operation took place
   in Belgium on June 5, 2001. Dirk Reyn was designated as the corporate
   representative and the deposition proceeded as planned. VI. Plaintiffs
   Profile Form and Authorization As of June 15, 2001, defendants have
   received 349 Patient Profile Forms. There are 102 currently overdue and
   26 PPF's will become due within thirty (30) days. PLC and DLC continue
   to communicate with plaintiffs attorneys whose PPF's are indicated to
   be overdue. DLC has advised its intent to present 2 for dismissal at
   the July Monthly Status Conference the names of plaintiffs who have
   failed to respond to follow-up requests for completion of the PPFs.
   VII. Depositions in State Matters that have been Cross Noticed Since
   the last monthly status conference, no deposition have been
   cross-noticed in the MDL. However, depositions in state cases have
   proceeded. PSC has requested that DLC provide advance notice of all
   depositions to be taken in Propulsid matters to PLC in advance of the
   depositions, irrespective of whether the deposition is cross-noticed
   into the MDL. DLC has agreed to provide advance notice of all
   depositions of Janssen employees (excluding sales reps) to be taken in
   Propulsid matters to PLC in advance of the depositions, irrespective of
   whether the deposition is cross-noticed into the MDL and the parties
   are continuing discussions as to other depositions. In addition,
   defendants have agreed to timely provide copies of any depositions
   taken in Propulsid cases that are not cross noticed in MDL-1355. Thus
   far DLC has produced two depositions from an Illinois state case. VIII.
   Subpoena to FDA On , May 30, 2001, Associate Chief Counsel of the FDA
   forwarded documents responsive to the subpoena to counsel for the
   defendants. Pursuant to agreement between the defendants and plaintiffs
   the documents were received and on June 11, 2001 PSC received the
   initial wave of production of FDA documents. On June 1, 2001 Associate
   Chief Counsel to the FDA advised that additional documents responsive
   to the subpoena were being produced. The defendants will be reviewing
   this material and providing it to the plaintiffs. It is anticipated
   that additional production in response to the subpoenas will be
   forthcoming and if there are any delays or issues arising out of the
   document production, they will be brought to the attention of the court
   at a monthly status conference. 3 IX. Service List of Attorneys PLC and
   DLC are communicating with newly enrolled counsel informing them of the
   court's Propulsid website, the necessity to submit questionnaires and
   certain deadlines. Additionally on May 25, 2001, DLC filed with the
   court a motion requesting that newly enrolled defense counsel complete
   an electronic questionnaire. PLC and DLC will have a master list of all
   counsel to present to the court at the June monthly status conference.

   development of a protocol for the production of ongoing studies. XI.
   Third Party Subpoena Duces Tecum Issued by PSC On May 30, 2001, PSC
   issued 43 subpoena Duces tecum to various advertising, publishing,
   public relation firms. PLC and DLC have attempted to coordinate the
   production responses for these subpoenas. PLC and DLC are discussing
   the creation of a protocol to enable efficient and economical
   production of information received from third parties to which
   subpoenas are issued. In addition an initial response to the subpoena
   issued to the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology has
   been received. XII. Scheduling Presentation of Class Certification
   Motion PLC and DLC have had ongoing discussions regarding a schedule to
   present a class certification motion. On June 14, 2001, DLC provided to
   PLC for discussion purposes, a proposed Pretrial Order providing a
   schedule for filing, discovery and hearing of a Motion for Class
   Certification. These discussions are ongoing and the parties will be
   prepared to discuss this at the June monthly status conference. 4 XIII.
   Documents Described in the Court's Docket as "Sealed documents" PLC and
   DLC have communicated regarding documents filed under seal and
   identified on the court's docket as "sealed documents" only. The
   parties have jointly drafted a motion that will be presented to the
   court to allow for the docket to identify the name of the party filing
   a confidential document and the name of the document filed under seal.
   The parties will be prepared to discuss this at the June monthly status
   conference. XIV. Tolling Agreement On May 31, 2001, defendants provided
   to plaintiffs a blank tolling agreement. PLC forwarded a copy of the
   agreement to all claimants' counsel and advised that should any counsel
   desire to enter into a tolling agreement on behalf of their clients
   that they should communicate directly with the DLC. Further discussion
   and refinements to the agreement are occurring. The parties are
   continuing discussions and will be prepared to discuss this at the June
   monthly status conference. XV. Defendants Request for Production of
