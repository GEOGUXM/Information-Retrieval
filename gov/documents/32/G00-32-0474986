   Unemployment Insurance Taxes

   Unemployment insurance (UI) is a Federal-State program jointly financed
   through Federal and State employer payroll taxes (Federal/State UI
   tax). Generally, employers must pay both State and Federal unemployment
   taxes if: (1) they pay wages to employees totaling $1500, or more, in
   any quarter of a calendar year; or, (2) they had at least one employee
   during any day of a week during 20 weeks in a calendar year, regardless
   of whether or not the weeks were consecutive. However, some State laws
   differ from the Federal law and employers should contact their States
   Employment Security Agency to learn the exact requirements.
   Federal Unemployment Tax Act
   The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), authorizes the Internal
   Revenue Service to collect a Federal employer tax used to fund State
   Employment Security Agencies. Employers pay this tax annually by filing
   IRS Form 940. FUTA covers the costs of administering the Unemployment
   Insurance and Job Service programs in all States. In addition, FUTA
   pays one-half of the cost of extended unemployment benefits (during
   periods of high unemployment) and provides for a fund from which States
   may borrow, if necessary, to pay benefits.
   Federal Tax Rate
   The FUTA tax rate is 6.2% of taxable wages. The taxable wage base is
   the first $7,000 paid in wages to each employee during a calendar year.
   Employers who pay the State unemployment tax, on a timely basis, will
   receive an offset credit of up to 5.4% regardless of the rate of tax
   they pay the State. Therefore, the net Federal tax rate is generally
   0.8% (6.2% - 5.4%). This would equate to a maximum of $56.00 per
   employee, per year (.008 X $7,000. = $56.00) in Federal tax. State tax
   rates are based on requirements of State law. A table of current tax
   rates and taxable wage base information for individual States is
   available in this web site under, Do you have a tax question? Tax
   Statistics 2001.
   State Unemployment Tax
   The State Unemployment Tax, paid to State Employment Security Agencies,
   is used solely for the payment of benefits to eligible unemployed
   workers.
   Domestic Employers Coverage
   Employers of domestic employees must pay State and Federal unemployment
   taxes if they pay cash wages to household workers totaling $1,000, or
   more, in any calendar quarter of the current or preceding year. A
   household worker is an employee who performs domestic services in a
   private home. Examples of household employees are: babysitters,
   caretakers, cleaning people, drivers, nannies, health aides, yard
   workers and private nurses.
   Employers of Agricultural Employees
   Employers must pay Federal unemployment taxes if: (1) they pay cash
   wages to employees of $20,000, or more, in any calendar quarter; or,
   (2) in each of 20 different calendar weeks in the current or preceding
   calendar year, there was at least 1 day in which they had 10 or more
   employees performing service in agricultural labor. The 20 weeks do not
   have to be consecutive weeks, nor must they be the same 10 employees,
   nor must all employees be working at the same time of the day.
   Generally, agricultural employers are also subject to State
   unemployment taxes, employers should contact their States Employment
   Security Agency to learn the exact requirements.
