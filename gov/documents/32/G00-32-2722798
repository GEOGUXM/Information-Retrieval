   MUTCD Team | Resource Centers | State DOTs | FHWA Division Offices

   Who's Who

   As you become more familiar with the changes and amendments to be
   included in the MUTCD Millennium Edition, use the Resources to help you
   find specific information or answers to your questions. Maybe you'd
   like to talk to (email? telephone?) a State DOT engineer who has
   experience installing retroflective signs and pavement markings on
   low-volume roads, but you're not certain whom to call. So, let's first
   consider some organizational responsibility.

   The FHWA Office of Transportation Operations manages the rewrite of the
   MUTCD and coordinates the rulemaking process through Federal Register
   notices.

     coordinating the revision of specific MUTCD Millennium Edition
     Parts.

   The four FHWA Resource Centers are central locations that provide
   technical and program support to the Division Offices and their State
   DOT, MPO, and other transportation partners. Each Resource Center has a
   specialist in MUTCD matters.

   The FHWA maintains a Division Office in each State. The FHWA staff in
   these Division Offices are more familiar with individual State issues,
   and they work closely with State and local highway agencies to resolve
   local issues of Traffic Control Device selection, installation, and
   maintenance.

   The State Departments of Transportation (DOTs), and the county and
   local highway agencies, however, are the agencies that own and operate
   most highways and roads throughout the country. Thus, it is the State
   DOTs, and the county and local agencies, that select, install, and
   maintain traffic control devices--in accordance with the FHWA MUTCD
   provisions.
