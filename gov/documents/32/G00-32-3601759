                   Level 1B Product Information and Status

   The Level 1B Code generates data products containing calibrated
   radiances for all 36 MODIS bands and reflectances for the reflective
   solar bands (bands 1 through 19 and 26). All data processed with L1B
   Version 3.0.0 or higher is considered validated. Click here for an
   overview of the code and data products.
