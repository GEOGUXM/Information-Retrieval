                       Equal Access to Transportation
            Action for Access - ONE DOT - Working Better Together

   For the 54 million Americans with disabilities, access means simply
   being able to use, enjoy and participate in the many aspects of
   society, including work, commerce and leisure activities.
   Transportation is a vital link that allows full participation. The
   Department is committed to building a transportation system that
   provides equal access for all Americans. With the advent of
   accessibility standards for electronic and information technology under
   Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, DOT is endeavoring to be
   at the forefront in ensuring accessibility to technology used by the
   Department to accomplish its vital mission.
