   Research Labs

      The Center for Bioinformatics at the NASA Ames Research Center applies
      advanced computer technology to the study of biological systems. We
      have four major concentrations in our work:

       1. Three dimensional, serial section reconstruction (image processing)
       2. Advanced Visualization (graphics/virtual environments)
       3. Modeling/Simulation (finite element/neuronal
          networks/electrophysiology)
       4. Neurotechnology (from biological neuronal circuits and systems to
          chips, processors and computer architectures)

   The Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Program at NASA Ames Research Center
   combines engineering and physiology to study adaptation of bone and
   muscle tissue to biomechanical loads on Earth and in space.

   The Actin Cytoskeleton Research Lab

   The Actin Cytoskeleton Research Lab
   Research in the lab focuses on how actin binding proteins affect the
   architecture of the actin cytoskeleton in various mammalian tissues
   during exposure to altered gravity conditions. Another project, in
   collaboration with Stuart Kim of Stanford University, involves
   evaluation of responses in the nematode C. elegans upon exposure to
   mechanical stimulation, including altered gravity conditions such as
   hypergravity simulated by centrifugation and microgravity during
   spaceflight
