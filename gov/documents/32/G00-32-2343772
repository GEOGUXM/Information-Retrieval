  Example of the information collected

   Below is an example of the information collected based on a standard
   request for a World Wide Web document:

xxx.yyy.com - - [28/Jan/1997:00:00:01 -0500]
"GET /sitename/news/nr012797.html HTTP/1.0"
200 16704 Mozilla 3.0/www.altavista.digital.com

     * xxx.yyy.com (or 123.123.23.12) -- this is the host name (or IP
       address) associated with the requester (you as the visitor). In
       this case, (....com) the requester is coming from a commercial
       address. Depending on the requestor's method of network connection,
       the host name (or IP address) may or may not identify a specific
       computer. Connections via many Internet Service Providers assign
       different IP addresses for each session, so the host name
       identifies only the ISP. The host name (or IP address) will
       identify a specific computer if that computer has a fixed IP
       address.
     * [28/Jan/1997:00:00:01 -0500] -- this is the date and time of the
       request
     * "GET /sitename/news/nr012797.html HTTP/1.0" - this is the location
       of the requested file
     * 200 -- this is the status code - 200 is OK - the request was filled
     * 16704 -- this is the size of the requested file in bytes
     * Mozilla 3.0 -- this identifies the type of browser software used to
       access the page, which indicates what design parameters to use in
       constructing the pages
     * www.altavista.digital.com -- this indicates the last site the
       person visited, which indicates how people find this site.

   Requests for other types of documents use similar information.

   No other user-identifying information is collected.
