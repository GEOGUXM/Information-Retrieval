                           Glossary of Basic Terms
    FRAMEWORK FOR CHANGE - The OEO's long-term strategy for reengineering
    its procedures and reinventing its core functions. The Framework for
    Change includes activities to streamline affirmative action planning,
      improve EEO Complaints Processing, including alternative dispute
      resolution implementation, the Workplace Diversity Initiative and
               establishment of an NIH-wide Diversity Council.

       WORKPLACE DIVERSITY INITIATIVE (WDI) - WDI is one of the major
    components of the Framework for Change. It is a strategy that focuses
   on bringing about organizational change that will engender respect for
    the similarities and differences employees bring to the workplace. It
    is designed to assist managers in learning how to capitalize on those
          differences to promote quality, fairness and efficiency.

   MANAGING DIVERSITY - Managing diversity is the process of creating and
   maintaining an environment that enables all employees to contribute to
        their full potential in pursuit of organizational objectives.

    RESPECTING DIVERSITY - The attitude that a person holds toward other
      people who may be viewed as either similar or different, but not
     attaching positive nor negative attributes to those differences and
   similarities and not interfering with their right to be different. The
   attitude is one of differential regard or consideration, and is without
                      positive or negative attributes.

       DIVERSITY CATALYST - A person designated by the IC Director to
   coordinate and develop the IC Diversity Initiative. The catalyst works
     in collaboration with the IC EEO Officer and IC leadership. The OEO
   Diversity Program Managers serve as consultants to the ICs. Some of the
        duties of the catalysts are chairing meetings, disseminating
    information to the appropriate IC staff, serving as a liaison between
      the IC and the OEO, and planning and developing the IC diversity
     initiative. The catalyst may or may not be the IC EEO Officer. The
   catalyst is expected to spend a sufficient amount of official duty time
    on this responsibility. The initial planning and developmental stages
                  may require more time than later stages.

    DIVERSITY COUNCIL - The Diversity Council is a body of NIH employees
      who advise the Director, OEO, on policies and programs to promote
      managing diversity at the NIH. The first Council was chosen from
      delegates to the 1995 Diversity Congress, participants in the WDI
    Workshop in 1996 and individuals selected by the Director, OEO, based
                         on their unique viewpoints.
