   WELCOME TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EAP

   Whether you are facing a stressful personal situation, or perhaps
   dealing with a more serious concern such as depression or substance
   abuse, your Employee Assistance Program is here to help you.

   As a State of California employee, you and your eligible dependents
   have access to statewide EAP. This program is provided by the State of
   California as part of the State’s commitment to promoting employee
   health and well-being. Offered at no charge to you, the EAP provides a
   valuable resource for support and information during difficult times,
   as well as consultation on day-to-day concerns.

   The EAP is provided by Merit Behavioral Care of California (MBC). MBC,
   one of the nation’s most experienced EAP organizations, has been
   serving California residents since 1983. With counselors available
   throughout the State, MBC is here to provide you with the assistance
   you need.
