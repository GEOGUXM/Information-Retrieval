              ARISS Objectives on the International Space Station

   ARISS will:
    1. SERVE as an educational outreach tool,
    2. BE an outreach to the amateur radio community and the general
       public,
    3. ALLOW a method for crews to maintain contact with family and
       friends while on orbit (to improve crew psychological factors),
    4. PROVIDE an experimental communications test bed,
    5. OFFER a back up communications link for emergencies, and
    6. PROVIDE public information to the grass-roots public.

   Based on these top level objectives a series of derived requirements
   have been developed:
    1. Eight minute contact with well equipped ground station
    2. Computer to computer radio links
    3. Thirty second contact with a minimal ground station
    4. Autonomous beaconing of status in digital form
    5. Still picture transmit & receive
    6. Video transmit & receive
    7. Support continuous contacts (for at least thirty minutes)
    8. Support multiple concurrent operations
    9. Space-to-space as well as space-to-ground operations

    Eight minute contact with well equipped ground station

   Required by: Education, Crew, Outreach.

   Currently the SAREX team specifies a minimum of four minutes above the
   horizon for scheduling a school pass. This is barely acceptable given
   the overhead of starting a contact and the usual losses at the end.
   Eight minutes has proven to be enough time to have a very productive
   school contact. This amount of time will also support family contacts
   for the crews. For outreach activities this length of contact time will
   allow a fair number of hams to try for packet and voice contacts.

    Computer to computer radio links

   Required by: Education, Experimentation, Outreach.

   Packet contacts have proven to be a very valuable tool for Mir and the
   Shuttle. The current "contest style" SAREX packets allow a larger
   number of amateurs to complete a contact with the Shuttle. The packet
   bulletins that the crews put out are very informative and an excellent
   outreach to the community. Electronic mail will play an increasing role
   with the longer duration missions. There are rumors of "student
   payloads" to be placed on board the ISS. One goal is to allow students
   direct interaction with their payloads via an amateur radio link.

    Thirty second contact with a minimal ground station

   Required by: Experimentation, Outreach.

   We want to make sure that introductory users can have some access to
   space.

    Autonomous beaconing of status in digital form

   Required by: Education, Outreach.

   A large community can be reached by allowing easy "scanning" listening.
   Voice and digital beacons will allow the ISS crews to keep the general
   community up to date on the status of amateur radio activities and
   experiments on board the ISS.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Still picture transmit & receive

   Required by: Education, Crew, Experimentation, Outreach.

   Pictures have always been a very valuable mechanism for education.
   There will have to be a lot of experimentation to develop efficient
   image techniques for the space environment.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Video transmit & receive

   Required by: Education, Crew, Experimentation, Outreach.

   Video will present special challenges but with the possibility of great
   rewards.

    Support continuous contacts (for at least thirty minutes)

   Required by: Education, Experimentation.

   Short contacts drive up the training and preparation times for
   contacts. Longer contacts will allow us to streamline the time between
   schools submitting their applications and when their contacts are
   scheduled. Longer contacts will also hopefully allow us to experiment
   with school contact formats other than the usual "question and answer".
     __________________________________________________________________

    Support multiple concurrent operations

   Required by: Education, Crew, Experimentation, Outreach.

   Personal contacts for the ISS crews will be very important and the
   ability to continue educational and general outreach activities during
   personal contacts is mandatory. The multiuse concept is not just for
   this however. The ARISS hardware will need to support multiple voice
   and digital modes at the same time.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Space-to-space as well as space-to-ground operations

   Required by: Crew, Experimentation.

   The ability to communicate between ISS, Mir, and Shuttle will be very
   important. Experimentation with "over the horizon" links through
   amateur radio satellites will be very exciting and also offer a
   possibility for greatly increasing the contact times between the ISS
   and ground stations. We should also investigate the possibility of
   using the "store and forward" email amateur radio satellites from the
   ISS.
