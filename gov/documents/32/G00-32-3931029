   NIH Office of Medical Applications of Research

   The Office of Medical Applications of Research (OMAR) within the
   National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the focal point for
   evidence-based assessments of medical practice and state-of-the-science
   on behalf of the medical community and the public.

   Located in the Office of the Director, OMAR works closely with NIH
   Institutes or Centers and Offices to assess, translate and disseminate
   the results of biomedical research that can be used in the delivery of
   important health services to the public.

   A major responsibility of OMAR is the coordination of the NIH Consensus
   Development Program. Under this program, OMAR organizes major
   conferences on complex issues of medical importance to health care
   providers, patients and the general public. These conferences are open
   to the public, broadcast on the Internet and free of chargeto
   participants. The NIH Consensus Statements and State of the Science
   Statements produced by these conferences are disseminated widely to
   health care practitioners, policymakers, patients, the media and the
   general public.

   An evidence-based assessment is prepared for each conference topic. The
   assessment involves a systematic review of the medical literature to
   define the state of medical practice or science by using rigorous
   criteria for categorizing the strength of the available evidence.

   OMAR routinely meets with scientists, clinicians, representatives from
   other Federal health agencies, and public representatives to discuss
   methods to further enhance the mission of the office. In addition, OMAR
   seeks to enhance the ability of lay and journalistic audiences to
   critically assess scientific reports and medical findings by developing
   and disseminating information on the methods of evidence-based
   medicine.

   OMAR is one administrative unit of the NIH Office of Disease
   Prevention. Other administrative units of ODP are the Office of Dietary
   Supplements and the Office of Rare Diseases.
