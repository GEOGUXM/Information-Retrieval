   Life on Earth The Earth's landscapes and oceans are teeming with
   lifemillions of species. Of particular interest to remote sensing
   scientists are those land- and marine-based plants that photosynthesize
   because they draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Using satellite
   and surface-based measurements, scientists seek to better understand
   our world's carbon cycle. Worldwide, what are the major "sources and
   sinks" of carbon?
