In Our Neighborhood

   BNL is situated in Brookhaven Town, Suffolk County. Though only about
   96 kilometers (60 miles) from New York City, much of Brookhaven Town is
   still rural. There is little public transportation, and a car is
   usually necessary to explore the area. The nearest grocery and drug
   stores are located in Shirley, about 8 kilometers (5 miles) south of
   BNL, and in Middle Island, about 8 kilometers west.

   Farther away are Patchogue about 24 kilometers (15 miles) southwest and
   Riverhead about 24 kilometers east, both of which offer a variety of
   stores, services and businesses. Located on Long Island Sound, about 32
   kilometers (20 miles) to the northwest, Port Jefferson is an
   attractive, historic seaport featuring many restaurants and shops.

   For information about special events scheduled in nearby communities
   during your stay, consult a local newspaper such as the Thursday or
