   The Verification Database is intended to provide a widely usable
   interface and access to a complex database. This web site is best
   understood by persons possessing some understanding of both database
   management and ECS development.     What is the VDB?
   If you have questions, comments, require a special report, or need a
   more thorough explanation of the VDB or the environment that the VDB
   serves, feel free to contact:     Why is the VDB important?

       How is the VDB's data organized?

   The VDB is developed, maintained, and supported by QSS Group, Inc.
   under contract to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center; the work is
   performed under the Multidisciplinary Engineering Development Services
   (MEDS) contract. The NASA-cognizant manager that directs and oversees
   this work is:     How do I get the reports?
