   California Environmental Protection Agency GUIDELINES FOR INSPECTION OF
   PUBLIC RECORDS June 1, 1995 All public records of the State Department
   of Toxic Substances Control which are subject to disclosure under the
   provision of the California Public Record Act (Government Code Section
   6250-6260), are open to inspection by the public during the normal
   office hours of the office where those records are located. However,
   certain Department records are confidential, e.g., patient records,
   attorney-client privilege, trade secret, personnel records, etc., and,
   by statute, may not be released to the public. These related statutes
   are available for review upon request in the offices concerned. Any
   person who wishes to inspect a public record may present his or her
   request to the receptionist; the request may also be made by mail or
   fax, to the office where the records are located. The requester must
   identify the requested records by a specific brief description and
   approximate date. No record may be removed from the office. The
   requester may obtain a copy of a specific identifiable public record,
   which is subject to disclosure. However, the Department cannot provide
   copies of large or voluminous numbers of records. A request for a copy
   of an identifiable public record, information produced from it, or a
   certified copy must be accompanied by payment of the described
   statutory fee where applicable. If there is no certification required,
   a minimum department fee of $.15 per page will be charged. Cost of
   mailing (first class) will be charged to those receiving the material,
   unless the requester makes other arrangements. The requester may
   produce a public record by his/her own means subject to the limitation
   that no record is removed from the office and the record is not damaged
   by reproduction equipment. The Department has ten working days to
   respond to the request by telephone, letter or fax. The Department may
   temporarily deny or restrict inspection of public records under any of
   the following circumstances: 1. The records are, at that particular
   time, required by staff of the Department or other state official to
   perform their duties. (1 of 3) The energy challenge facing California
   is real. Every Californian needs to take immediate action to reduce
   energy consumption. For a list of simple ways you can reduce demand and
   cut your energy costs, see our Web-site at www.dtsc.ca.gov. Printed on
   Recycled Paper 2. The Department has reason to fear defacement or other
   injury to the records and it is not possible to supervise the
   inspection of the records at that particular time. 3. Other members of
   the public are waiting to inspect the records. 4. An individual is
   monopolizing certain records to the detriment of other members of the
   public who wish to inspect the same records. 5. An unusual amount of
   time will be required to locate the records. List of field offices and
