DIAL Release 3.1 (11/30/2000)

   DIAL Release 3.1 is available for the following platforms:
     * SGI / IRIX
     * SUN / SOLARIS
     * ALPHA / DIGITAL UNIX
     * PC / WINDOWS 95/NT

   The distributed search capability (using V0 protocol) is supported for
   the following platforms:
     * SGI / IRIX
     * SUN / SOLARIS
     * ALPHA/DIGITAL UNIX

   New Features:

     * Distributed Search using CIP protocol (SUN/SOLARIS)
     * Cross-granule Animation

   Known Problems:
     * For enabling a DIAL center with Distributed Data Service, DIAL
       catalog should be created using .meta files only.
     * Distributed search is only supported on a limited selection of
       platforms
     * Release 3.0 and 3.1 for Windows 98 platform gives HDF Mapping
       Gateway error when a datafile is selected for viewing from the
       search result set.

   Acknowledgement:

   DIAL's CIP distributed search is based on DLR's Retrieval Manager.
   Cross-granule download does not work on Linux.

     * SGI / IRIX
     * SUN / SOLARIS
     * ALPHA / DIGITAL UNIX
     * PC / WINDOWS 95/98/NT
     * PC / LINUX (GNU)

   The distributed search capability (using V0 protocol) is supported for
   the following platforms:
     * SGI / IRIX
     * SUN / SOLARIS
     * ALPHA/DIGITAL UNIX

   New Features:

     * Improved Scalability
     * Distributed Data Service
     * Cleanup Serverside Tool (for removing temporary files)

   Changes:

     * DIAL catalog creation tool was modified for improved scalability.
     * Catalog tool was modified for including data file size.
     * DIAL Search CGI was updated for HTML interface changes and
       Distributed Data Service.
     * DIAL View CGI was updated for interface changes.  Uses HTML frame
       structure for improved navigation.
     * HTML Search results implements frame structure.  Uses left side of
       the frame for displaying datafiles and right side of the frame for
       displaying selected file metadata.
     * Cleanup tool removes all the temporary files generated by the DIAL
       CGI.

   Fixes:

     Fixed broken gif problem caused by memory leak

   Known Problems:
     * For enabling a DIAL center with Distributed Data Service, DIAL
       catalog should be created using .meta files only.
     * Distributed search is only supported on a limited selection of
       platforms
     * Loading speed for the color composite is slow, if the image is too
       large (>5 MB)
    Cross-granule download does not work on Linux.

   New Features:

     V0 protocol directory search support

   Changes:

     Requires a mapping table for mapping a DatasetID with the Directory
     Interchange Format (DIF) ID obtained from the Global Change Master
     Directory (GCMD).

   Fixes:

     Now DIAL supports HDF's 24 Bit Raster (DF24) or General Raster (GR)
   data model.

     Fixed the problem of animating an image that has at least one
   dimension that has less than 100 pixels.

   Known Problems:
     * Distributed search is only supported on a limited selection of
       platforms
     * Loading speed for the color composite is slow, if the image is too
       large (>5 MB)
     * Cross-granule download does not work on Linux.
