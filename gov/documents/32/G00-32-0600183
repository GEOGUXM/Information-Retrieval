   Programs

   Did You Know?
   Since 1982, WCPCAN has funded over 161 distinct child abuse prevention
   and family support programs across the state; increased public
   awareness of child abuse prevention issues, like Shaken Baby Syndrome,
   advocated for public policies that support families and protect
   children, and has provided a wide variety of resources and technical
   assistance to service providers, policy makers, community volunteers
   and parents. WCPCAN has combined both private and public resources to
   accomplish its goals. This has included many partnerships both private
   and public.

   Program Anecdotes
   Nooksack Valley, Birth to Three Project
   The third quarter has been both rewarding and somewhat frustrating. The
   rewarding part has been reflected in the implementation of services for
   children and families identified during the first and second quarters.
   Our center feels full with over 80 children 0-5 being served and
   enrolled parents increasingly accessing options for themselves at the
   center. For instance, one parent recently commented, "I have been
   wanting to tell you how wonderful this center is! If anyone had told me
   that I could enroll my child in a preschool where she would get speech
   therapy, AND there would be an infant class where my baby could hang
   out and have a good time...I would have said, had GOD become a WOMAN?"
   The blending of programs, services, and populations of families is
   working!
