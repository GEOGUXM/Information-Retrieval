   NIST Integrated Services Protocol Instrument (ISPI)

   ISPI is an interactive, integrated tool for measuring the performance
   of quality of service (QoS) sensitive data streams while conducting
   experiments with emerging Internet resource reservation protocols and
   real-time network services.  ISPI is capable of supporting stream
   selection based upon session directory protocols (i.e., SD, SDR),
   monitoring the performance of data streams that use the Real Time
   Transport Protocol (RTP) and allowing proxy interaction with routers
   supporting the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP).    In multicast
   applications, ISPI can be used to monitor the performance of all
   senders and receivers participating in a distributed, real-time
   application.    Interactive stream selection and filtering capabilities
   allows the ISPI user view cumulative statistics for all participants in
   a multiparty session, or to select and focus on specific
   sender/receiver pairs for more detailed performance data.
