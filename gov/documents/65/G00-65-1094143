              Identification and Development of Best Practices

   "Best practices" are processes of care that either have a demonstrated
   ability to produce optimal health outcomes for individuals with SCI or
   that clinical experts have agreed will lead to the highest quality
   health outcomes for persons with SCI.  Often, best practices are
   operationalized through clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) which
   include systematically developed recommendations to assist
   practitioners and patients decisions about appropriate health care
   for specific clinical circumstances (Field & Lohr, 1992).

   Best practices for SCI are being defined in CPGs developed through peer
   review of evidence-based literature by the Consortium for Spinal Cord
   Medicine.  The Consortium was initiated in 1995 to develop, produce,
   and disseminate evidence-based CPGs for the SCI clinical and consumer
   communities.  Using a model similar to that used in the Agency for
   Health Care and Policy Research's development of CPGs, this Consortium
   of 18 health professional, payer, and consumer organizations has
   developed CPGs for 5 clinical conditions to date, including the
   following:
     * Acute Management of Autonomic Dysreflexia (02/97),
     * Prevention of Thromboembolism in Spinal Cord Injury (02/97),
     * Thromboembolism-2nd Edition w/revisions (10/99)
     * Neurogenic Bowel Management in Adults with Spinal Cord Injury
       (03/98),
     * Depression Following Spinal Cord Injury: A Clinical Practice
       Guideline for Primary Care Physicians (08/98), and
     * Outcomes Following Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury: Clinical Practice
       Guidelines for Health-Care Professionals (07/99),
     * Pressure Ulcer Prevention and Treatment Following Spinal Cord
       Injury:  A Clinical Practice Guidelines for Health-Care
       Professionals (08/00).

   CPGs In Development:
     * Autonomic Dysreflexia-2nd Edition  w/additional topics including:

     1) Pregnancy and gynecological issues &

     2) Pediatrics.

     * Provision of Annual Evaluation*
       *Dr. Michael Priebe of the SCI QUERI Executive Committee is serving
       as the chair for the development of an Annual Evaluation CPG, and
       Dr. Fran Weaver, SCI QUERI Research Chair, has been asked to serve
       on the CPG panel.

   Plans for Future Development:
     * Spasticity
     * Urologic Management
     * Neuropathic Pain
     * Respiratory/Pulmonary Management


   The neurogenic bowel and thromboembolism CPGs are currently being
   implemented and evaluated through research supported by VHA and SCI
   QUERI (A. Nelson, 98/99).  For more information about VHA and SCI QUERI
