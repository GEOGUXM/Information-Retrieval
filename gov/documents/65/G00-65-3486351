   Report a Vehicle Safety Problem
   Vehicle Owner's Questionnaire; Click to fill out the form

   In order for NHTSA to respond promptly to requests for information,
   suggestions or comments; they should be addressed to:
   webmaster@nhtsa.dot.gov.

   Use this form only to report a problem. If you prefer, call the DOT
   Auto Safety Hotline at 1-888-DASH-2-DOT (1-888-327-4236) and a NHTSA
   representative will record your report. Your report will be entered
   into NHTSA's vehicle owner's complaint database and used with other
   reports to determine if a safety-related defect trend exists.

   If a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle or item of motor
   vehicle equipment, the manufacturer must fix it at no cost to the
   owner. Your report is the first step in the process.

   Government engineers analyze the problem. If warranted, the
   manufacturer is asked to conduct a recall. If the manufacturer does not
   initiate a recall, the government can order the manufacturer to do a
   recall.

   We do not have to receive a set number of reports before we look into a
   problem. We gather all available information on a problem. Your report
   is important to us.
