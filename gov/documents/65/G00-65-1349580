Internet Design & Hosting

   Contact: Vickie Medina

   This service offers a robust, reliable, and flexible web site
   alternative to small and mid-tier UNIX and NT based platforms. The
   hosting is performed on the ITO System/390 Enterprise Server. Standard
   authoring and management tools provide a rapid response service for
   updates as well as customer control over content. Professional
   management of the server, site authoring environment and development of
   the WEB applications will be provided.

   Benefits include:
     * Solid and proven security in place on the System/390 Enterprise
       Server.
     * Improved reliability as the System/390 Enterprise Server is
       available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.
     * Robust architecture that can support an extremely high rate of hits
       per minute. Essentially no delay no matter how busy the site gets.
