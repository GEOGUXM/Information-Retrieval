                               STARDUST Mural

   Answering the call of their art teachers to paint something that
   inspired them, Rebekah Sorensen and Sarah McCready, 10th graders from
   Meadow Creek Christian School, Anoka, Minn., created a 5-by-8- foot
   mural depicting NASA's Stardust mission, the first space mission to
   collect dust from a comet's tail.

   The poem below was submitted by Rich Ensign, Director of the Crestwood
                  School District Planetarium in Michigan.

                                STARDUST POEM

   Since my grandfather Frederick M. Holbrook inspired my life and sent me
      down the road to becoming a Planetarium Director (for the last 31
   years), I put his name on the microchip on the Stardust spacecraft and
    recently wrote the following poem. It is relevant for all who follow
           this mission particularly young followers of Stardust.

                     GRANDFATHER'S SWEEPING UP STARDUST

Grandfather's sweeping up stardust
Out in the Milky Way
Borne by the ship that carries his name
Returning to Earth someday.

Others travel beside him
Whose relatives thought they should come
The, signify the human wish
To return to where they came from.

I'm sweeping out there alongside him
My mother, his daughter's there too
Think of the sights that fill days and nights
And the work that we all have to do.

Collecting the dust of creation
That our Sun is drifting through
We'll hold it tight on the journey
And send it safe home to you.

Before we come home we'll be traveling
Close to the comet Wild 2
We know there's a risk as we pass through the tail
We'll be sweeping up comet dust too.

Stardust's the name of the spacecraft
That carries us all on our way
And when we return to the blue Earth
Oh the wonders we'll tell you that day.

       -- Rich Ensign, Director
            Crestwood School District Planetarium
            Dearborn Heights, MI
