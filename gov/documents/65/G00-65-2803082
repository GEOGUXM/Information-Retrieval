     QuickZone
     by Deborah Curtis

     QuickZone: A Strategic Workzone Estimation Tool What is the true
     cost of a road construction or improvement project? Very few state
     and local highway officials or construction contractors can give a
     full answer, even after projects are completed and paid for. That's
     because, in the overwhelming majority of cases, officials and
     contractors have calculated only "hard costs," such as labor and
     materials.

     But there are also "soft costs" to every road project. These are the
     costs to road users - motorists and their passengers - who must
     spend extra minutes or even hours of their valuable time in their
     vehicles trying to negotiate their way through work zones. This type
     of traveler delay is significant - especially to the traveler - but
     its cost is rarely factored in.

     Meanwhile, the traveler must operate with only a vague idea of what
     his/her delays will be. He knows there will be delays, but he
     doesn't know how long they will last.

     In short, a tool to quantify delays and estimate user cost would
     benefit everyone affected by work zones, including highway
     officials, workers, and motorists.

     Enter QuickZone. QuickZone is recently released software that will
     estimate traveler delay due to work zones. By doing so, it will
     provide a more complete and realistic view of total construction
     costs. The software was developed by the Office of Research,
     Development, and Technology in the Federal Highway Administration
     (FHWA) and by Mitretek Systems.

     QuickZone is a key component of the Strategic Work-Zone Analysis
     Tools (SWAT) Program of FHWA. The SWAT team at FHWA's
     Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center in McLean, Va., developed
     QuickZone following the 1998 release of the FHWA report Meeting the
     Customer's Needs for Mobility and Safety During Construction and
     Maintenance Operations.

     This report states that road-user cost is typically not considered
     when construction zones are planned. It recommends the development
     of an analytic tool, such as an easy-to-use software program, that
     would estimate and quantify work-zone delays and resulting user
     costs.

     QuickZone will provide results in an easily readable spreadsheet
     form.

     "Spreadsheets are tools that people are familiar with," said James
     Larkin, a senior systems engineer at Mitretek. "We wanted it to be
     easy for people to use, easy for them to put information in, and to
     get information out."

     This tool is particularly necessary in light of the fact that many
     interstate highways are approaching the end of their design life. As
     a result, work zones are encountered more and more frequently. The
     motorist is affected not only as he commutes to work but on pleasure
     trips as well. Frustration with work-zone delays will only continue
     to increase.

     QuickZone, a Microsoft Excel Workbook application, can be used by
     anyone with Excel 97 or higher. The only other requirements are a
     Windows-based computer with minimal memory and processing speed. The
     cost of the software is also minimal - in the $200 range. The
     typical QuickZone users are state and local highway officials and
     other officials planning highway construction. However, consultants
     may also use QuickZone to analyze different project alternatives.

     To use QuickZone, a user would input data such as:
     * Work zone location.
     * Projected detour routes, if any.
     * Anticipated volumes of traffic.
     * Construction dates and times.

     The program is designed so that the setup of a typical work-zone
     network should take less than an hour. Once the data is entered,
     results should be available in graphic form in about three minutes.
     The graphic will display the amount of delay in vehicle-hours as
     well as the maximum length of the queue that can be expected.

     Once officials, planners, and contractors have these numbers, they
     can analyze them to determine whether the amount of delay is
     reasonable and acceptable. If so, they can proceed on course. But if
     not, QuickZone can help once again. The program will offer
     suggestions for bringing the amount of delay under control.
     Suggestions may include:
     * A news media campaign to get information out about the planned work
       zone so that drivers may choose other routes if possible.
     * Posting or activating highway information signs that will inform
       motorists of the scheduled dates and times of the work zone.
     * Retiming signals on detour routes so that motorists won't have to
       stop at multiple red lights.
     * Changing the times of construction to make the project more
       cost-effective to both the contractor and the motorist. For
       example, officials may have planned night construction to ease
       delays, but it may actually be more cost-effective for everyone to
       do a project over the course of one full day rather than two or
       three nights. Or, it may be better to close a lane and finish a
       project in two weeks rather than trying to keep all lanes open and
       making it a six-week project.

     Armed with this information, officials and contractors can figure
     out the best schedule for construction, taking user costs (motorist
     costs) into account. QuickZone simply provides a more realistic and
     complete view of total construction costs.

     QuickZone is available now on the Web
     (www.tfhrc.gov/its/quickzon.htm), but the program has not yet been
     field-tested. A version of QuickZone (1.0) that has been
     field-tested, using data from work zones, will be available in
     October. QuickZone (1.0) and full technical support will be
     available from McTrans at the University of Florida.

     The program has been well-received so far. In addition, highway
     officials, construction contractors, and universities have expressed
     interest. So have the U.S. military services, which build roads on
     bases, as well as the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which builds roads
     on Native American reservations.

     FHWA and Mitretek are eager to develop partnerships for
     field-testing QuickZone. One potential partnership will be with the
     University of Maryland. The university has its own version of the
     program and is modifying it for use by the Maryland Department of
     Transportation.

     The QuickZone partnership program is open to all interested parties.
     FHWA will provide free source code and technical support in exchange
     for rights to include any updates or additions in the FHWA-release
     version of QuickZone.

     "I think we've hit gold," said Larkin. "We've gotten a very positive
     response. We really think we've filled a niche. We think we can
     achieve a substantial reduction in user delay. What is the cost to
     the user sitting in his car? That is the heart of the QuickZone
     program."
