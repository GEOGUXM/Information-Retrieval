PREVENT FIRE. SAVE LIVES.
A USFA Campaign to Reduce Fire Casualties to Older Adults

   More than 1,200 Americans over the age of 65 die as a result of fire
   and 3,000 are injured due to residential fires each year. To get the
   word out about this serious and growing problem, USFA has developed the
   Prevent Fire. Save Lives. campaign to combat this high risk of death
   and injury among seniors.

   The Campaign Kit for Partners is designed to aid you and your
   organization in educating seniors about fire safety and to spread the
   word about this important campaign to your local media. The materials
   in the partner kit include a sample pitch letter, press release, and
   opinion-editorial article. These documents are in template form to
   better enable you to tailor materials to include your organization's
   information. The kit also includes three fact sheets that illustrate
   the fire safety challenges faced by seniors, adults with disabilities,
   and the deaf or hard of hearing. A Fire Safety Checklist for Older
   Americans brochure, produced by the American Association of Retired
   Persons (AARP) is also included. Print public service announcements
   (PSAs) for newspapers and magazines are enclosed for distribution to
   local newspapers or community groups.

   Use these materials to aid in creating your own news releases, fact
   sheets and radio PSA scripts or copy an use them as they are. Please
   duplicate and distribute as many copies of these materials as desired.

   To order your copy of the Prevent Fire. Save Lives. Campaign Kit for
   Partners, please complete the order form below. This kit is available
