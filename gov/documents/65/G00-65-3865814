     Please print out the Registration Form for which you want to register
   and fax to (816)823-5104  or send to the FEB office at  1500 E.
   Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO  64131.  Please be sure to follow
   instructions on form.


   **  Due to the increase in expenses for our various functions (catering
   prices have raised, audio visual is becoming more expensive as most
   speakers want Power Point Projectors, and rent has been raised) it is
   necessary for us to increase registration fees by $5.00 on most
   functions.
