   The Lake Ontario Winter Storms Project was a study of winter storms
   along the Radars and profiler on a snowy night. eastern shores of Lake
   Ontario in upstate New York. Its primary focus was the use of new
   remote sensing instruments to study structure and dynamics of lake
   effect snowstorms which make this one of the snowiest regions of the
   United States. Although these storms are shallow, they are strongly
   driven by infusions of thermal energy and water vapor from the
   relatively warm surface of the lake to the frigid air blowing across
   it. The area is also frequently hit by destructive freezing rain
   storms. ETL operated its NOAA/C radar, steerable microwave radiometer,
   and its first boundary layer wind profiler north of Syracuse as part of
   the LOWS field project in early 1990.
