     __________________________________________________________________

        LACSI was founded to execute long-term research in support of
        high-performance computing applicable to Los Alamos National
      Laboratory's mission. When possible, the Institute will apply its
     intermediate stages of research to current problems of national or
    global interest. LACSI is currently operated as a partnership between
   Los Alamos and four academic institutions: Rice University, University
   of Houston, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and University
                                of Tennessee.

    The Los Alamos Computer Science Institute is a direct response to the
      recent report of the President's Information Technology Advisory
   Committee (PITAC) which encourages the information technology research
    community to refocus its attention on long-term fundamental research.
   Three areas were called out as especially needing attention: software,
   scalable information infrastructure, and high-performance computation.
    The Institute is structured to make fundamental contributions in each
     of these areas, with a special emphasis on software and scientific
        computation, because we can draw on the vision of a group of
     world-class computer scientists at the participating institutions.
