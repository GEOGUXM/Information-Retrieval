        __________________________________________________________________

      Background:
      The California State Employees Charitable Campaign (CSECC) was
      established in 1957 to provide a single charitable fund raising drive
      in the State community. The regulations enabling the campaign are found
      in the California Administrative Code. The campaign is overseen by the
      Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board (Board).
      Although the CSECC is referred to as if it were a single entity, there
      is no single "state" campaign. Rather, there are approximately 36
      campaigns. Each one of these local campaigns produces its own separate
      campaign brochures, publicity materials and campaign plans.
      Every year the Board selects an organization to manage the campaign in
      various regions. This organization is known as the Principal Combined
      Fund Drive Agency (PCFD).
      During a six week period in the fall, each state employee is given a
      payroll deduction pledge form and a brochure listing over 1300
      participating charitable agencies. State employees may also choose any
      tax exempt agency not in the brochure.
      Pursuant to Government Code section 13923 and Title 2, California Code
      of Regulations, section 663, the Victim Compensation and Government
      Claims Board is authorized to consider applications and issues relating
      to the annual California State Employees' Charitable Campaign
      (Campaign). Specifically, the Board determines which charitable
      organizations may participate in the Campaign.
      Charitable organizations may apply to the Board for one of the
      following designations:
       1. To be considered the "principle combined fund drive" (PCFD) agency
          in a particular geographic area, or
       2. To be considered a "nonaffiliated organization" (NAFF).

      Definitions
      PRINCIPAL COMBINED FUND DRIVE AGENCIES (PCFD):
      The PCFD agencies are those organizations approved by the Board to be
      responsible for conducting the Campaign in designated geographic areas
      (typically cities and counties). This responsibility involves:
       1. Publishing and distributing Campaign literature, which includes a
          listing of the approved nonaffiliated organizations in each PCFD
          agency's campaign areas;
       2. Distributing pledge/designation forms to State employees during the
          workplace solicitation process;
       3. Transmitting contributions to the designated organizations (less
          fundraising and administrative expenses as approved by the Board).

      Each PCFD application also includes certification forms from
      "affiliated member beneficiary" (affiliated) organizations that are
      directly associated with the PCFD. Affiliated organizations are
      eligible to receive Campaign contributions through their PCFD
      association, and they must certify to the Board their compliance with
      the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Part 2.8 (commencing
      with Section 12900).
      NON-AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS (NAFF)
      Charitable organizations that are not affiliated member beneficiaries
      of the approved PCFD agencies may apply to the Board to be included in
      Campaign material and to receive Campaign-related contributions as a
      "nonaffiliated organization" (nonaffiliated).
      Unlike PCFDs, nonaffiliated Campaign fundraising activities are not
      restricted to designated geographic areas. Therefore, NAFFs may receive
      Campaign contributions from donors in all 58 counties if so indicated
      on their applications.
      All non-affiliated applicants must certify their exempt status under
      both Section 23701d of the California Revenue and Taxation Code and
      Section 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1954,
      and they must certify their compliance with the provisions of the
      California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Part 2.8 (commencing with
      Section 12900).
      FEDERATIONS
      Some non-affiliates act as Federations. A Federation is defined as any
      organization that represents another organization in the Campaign,
      excluding the PCFDs. (see above for the definition and responsibilities
      of a PCFD).
      WRITE-IN ORGANIZATIONS
      An additional means of obtaining Campaign contributions is as a
      "write-in" organization, which is generally an organization that has
      not applied to the Board but has been explicitly designated by a donor
      on the donor's pledge form. Write-in organizations are not subject to
      the exempt status certification requirement or the California Fair
      Employment and Housing Act compliance certification requirement as are
      PCFDs or nonaffiliated organizations, nor are write-in organizations
      subject to Board approval.

      Does the Board allow for dual listing when a national and an affiliate
      organization are listed?
      No. We do not allow for dual listing. In order to be listed more than
      once, an organization must be known under a different name. For
      example: The Government Claims Board of Sacramento County and The
      Government Claims Board of Los Angeles County.
      My organization is represented by more than one Federation. May we list
      both on the application?
      No. The Board will only accept one Federation per non-affiliate
      organization.
      May we fax our application to the Board?
      No. The Board must have an original signature(s) in order for the
      application to be considered complete.
      My charitable organization did not submit and application for
      participation in the current Campaign by the March deadline. Can we
      still participate in the Campaign?
      Yes.
      Prior to April 24, 2002:
      If your late application is received prior April 24, 2002, the Board
      will consider your organization for participation in the Campaign.
      Please attach a cover letter to our application explaining the
      reason(s) for applying after the deadline. However,
      After April 24, 2002:
      The only recourse to be had for the reception of any contribution funds
      is if a state employee explicitly designates your organization on their
      pledge form. This is the only way your organization may receive a
      donation from a state employee for the current year's Campaign.
      Must an employee designate a specific organization to which his/her
      funds may be donated?
      No. An employee may leave the recipient organization open. His or her
      funds will then be designated to the organization(s) the Principal
      Combined Fund Drive chooses.
      I am a state employee and have questions regarding my contribution
   deduction. Who should I contact?
   You should contact the Principal Combined Fund Drive Agency in your
   area. Your agency's Campaign Coordinator should be able to give you
   this information.

   REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE
   SECTION 23701d
   23701. Organizations which are organized and operated for nonprofit
   purposes within the provisions of a specific section of this article,
   or are defined in Section 23701h (relating to certain title-holding
   companies) or Section 23701x (relating to certain title-holding
   companies), are exempt from taxes imposed under this part, except as
   provided in this article or in Article 2 (commencing with Section
   23731) of this chapter, if: (a) An application for exemption is
   submitted in the form prescribed by the Franchise Tax Board; and (b) A
   filing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25) is paid with each application
   for exemption filed with the Franchise Tax Board after December 31,
   1969; and (c) The Franchise Tax Board issues a determination exempting
   the organization from tax. This section shall not prevent a
   determination from having retroactive effect and does not prevent the
   issuance of a determination with respect to a domestic organization
   which was in existence prior to January 1, 1970, and exempt under prior
   law without the submission of a formal application or payment of a
   filing fee. For the purpose of this section, the term "domestic" means
   created or organized under the laws of this state. The Franchise Tax
   Board may issue rulings and regulations as are necessary and reasonable
   to carry out the provisions of this article.
   23701d. (a) Corporations, community chests or trusts, organized and
   operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for
   public safety, literary, or educational purposes, or to foster national
   or international amateur sports competition (but only if no part of its
   activities involved the provision of athletic facilities or equipment),
   or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, no part of the
   net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder
   or individual, no substantial part of the activities of which is
   carrying on propaganda or otherwise attempting to influence
   legislation, (except as otherwise provided in Section 23704.5), and
   which does not participate in, or intervene in (including the
   publishing or distribution of statements), any political campaign on
   behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office. An
   organization is not organized exclusively for exempt purposes listed
   above unless its assets are irrevocably dedicated to one or more
   purposes listed in this section. Dedication of assets requires that in
   the event of dissolution of an organization or the impossibility of
   performing the specific organizational purposes the assets would
   continue to be devoted to exempt purposes. Assets shall be deemed
   irrevocably dedicated to exempt purposes if the articles of
   organization provide that upon dissolution the assets will be
   distributed to an organization which is exempt under this section or
   Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or to the federal
   government, or to a state or local government for public purposes; or
   by a provision in the articles of organization, satisfactory to the
   Franchise Tax Board; that the property will be distributed in trust for
   exempt purposes; or by establishing that the assets are irrevocably
   dedicated to exempt purposes by operation of law. The irrevocable
   dedication requirement shall not be a sole basis for revocation of an
   exempt determination made by the Franchise Tax Board prior to the
