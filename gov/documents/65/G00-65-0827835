                    Fax Service for Orders and Judgments
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Beginning April 3, 2000 the Northern District began offering, on a
   voluntary basis, fax service of all orders, notices and judgments to
   counsel who have appeared in a civil or criminal action and who have
   filed a written consent with the Clerk's office.
   Fax service will allow attorneys to receive these documents
   substantially faster than by mail, indeed in most cases facsimile
   transmissions will be received the same day they are signed. It will
   also reduce our costs for postage, printing and envelopes.
   Participation in this program is purely voluntary and it is unnecessary
   that all counsel in a case consent to such service. Our purpose in
   offering this service is to provide counsel with a useful alternative
   to service by mail.
   The Clerk's office will maintain a report confirming receipt by parties
   of the fax transmission which will be made available to counsel on
   request. If we are unable to confirm receipt of the fax transmission
   the document will be mailed the following business day. If the
   transmission is confirmed you will not be mailed a copy of the
   document.
   If you are interested in participating in this program you may
   participate by completing a waiver and returning it to the Clerk's
   office.
   If you agree to participate in the program orders, judgments and other
   documents will be faxed to you in all cases and you will not be mailed
   copies unless there is a difficulty in transmission. You are of course
   free to withdraw your consent at anytime simply by notifying this
   office in writing that you no longer wish to participate.
   If you have any questions please feel free to contact the Clerk's
   Office at (319)286-2300.
