   Its illegal in Saint Paul to leave a sidewalk unshoveled after a
   significant accumulation of snow. To report a sidewalk thats a safety
   hazard and needs shoveling, just send e-mail to
   snowshovel@ci.stpaul.mn.us

   Important: Be sure to tell us the address of the property, and check to
   be certain its within city boundaries.

   The City will contact the property owner to make sure that the sidewalk
   gets shoveled as soon as possible. In extreme cases, the City may send
   a crew to clear the sidewalk, and bill the property owner for the
   (high-priced) work.
