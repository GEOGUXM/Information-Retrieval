      Responding to all types of emergencies on a daily basis is the
      role-played by most of the CDF workforce. Those emergencies take the
      form of wildland fires, residential/commercial structure fires,
      automobile accidents, heart attacks, drownings, lost hikers, hazardous
      material spills on highways, train wrecks, floods, earthquakes - the
      list is endless. CDF's firefighters, fire engines and aircraft respond
      to an average 6,700 wildland fires, and nearly 273,000 non-wildfire
      emergencies each year.
      CDF crews and equipment are a familiar sight throughout the State with
      responsibility for the protection of over 31 million acres of
      California's privately-owned wildlands. In addition, they provide
      emergency services of all kinds within 35 of California's 58 counties
      through local government contracts.
      The information provided on these pages depicts the challenges CDF's
      dedicated, well-trained, emergency response forces face each day, and
      how they meet those challenges.
