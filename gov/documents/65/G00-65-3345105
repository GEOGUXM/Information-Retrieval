                           Principles & Guidelines

      Successful management of Sacramento River riparian forests depends on
      several basic ideas.  SB1086 projects must follow the following
      principles:
        * Use an ecosystem approach that contributes to the recovery of
          threatened and endangered species which is sustainable by natural
          processes.
        * Use the most effective and least environmentally damaging bank
          protection technique to maintain a limited meander, where
          appropriate.
        * Operate within the parameters of local, state and federal flood
          control and bank protection programs.
        * Participation by private landowners is voluntary; never mandatory.
        * Give full consideration to landowner, public, and local government
          concerns.
        * Accurate and accessible information/education is essential to sound
          resource management.
