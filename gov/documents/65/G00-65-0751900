                                        The Engineering Directorate's Vision is:

     "Engineering excellence enabling our customers' mission success"

                               Our Mission is:

     "In partnership with our customers, we provide engineering &
     excellence in research, technology, development and support,
     essential to mission success and safety, and built upon our core
     values."

     In terms of general ED functions and capabilities, the Directorate:

     * Plans, performs, and directs research and development in
       engineering and analysis of electrical systems, guidance and
       control systems, radio frequency subsystems, computer and
       simulation systems, software, and avionics simulation systems
       related to space vehicles, payloads, and support equipment.
     * Plans, conducts and directs research and development in structural,
       mechanical and thermal systems for the analysis, design and/or
       qualification testing of space and launch vehicles, payloads and
       systems.
     * Provides science, technology, and engineering design, development
       and test of materials, processes, manufacturing technology; and
       products to be used in space vehicle applications, including ground
       facilities, test articles, and support equipment.
     * Plans and performs systems related cross-cutting engineering
       services and support encompassing NASA standards, mass properties,
       kinematics, supportability and logistics, modeling and simulation,
       human engineering, configuration and data management,
       electromagnetic environmental effects, space environments, and
       terrestrial/planetary environments.
     * Integrates cross-cutting technology development activities and
       leads the Space Environments and Effects program for the Agency
     * Integrates business management processes and supports Center and
       Agency-wide initiatives in improving NASA business practices.
