   SPECTROMICROSCOPY: Bright infrared beam follows changes in living human
   cells

   An infrared (IR) spectromicroscopy technique that enables the
   observation of subtle chemical and molecular changes in individual
   human cells nondestructively without killing the cells or using
   intrusive probes was described in late March at the annual meeting of
   the American Physical Society (APS; Minneapolis, MN) by researchers
   from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL; Berkeley, CA).
   Although new to applications in living human cells, the technique,
   Synchrotron Radiation-Based Fourier Transform Infrared (SR-FTIR)
   spectromicroscopy, has been previously used for studies in
   environmental, forensic, and materials sciences.

   "Traditional methods of biomedical research either require killing
   cells, averaging results from many cells, or introducing dyes or tagged
   proteins or other agents that can affect cell chemistrymethods that
   usually involve tedious sample preparation and long delays between
   experiment and result," said Hoi-Ying Holman of LBNL's Earth Sciences
   Division, the principal investigator in developing the new technique.
   "Now we can study individual cells in real time without introducing
   extraneous factors." Holman described the technique a week after the
   APS meeting at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society (San
   Francisco, CA).

   [th_0500news17.gif] The technique relies on the ability to focus the
   infrared synchrotron beam to a spot less than 10 µm in diameter that
   also happens to be a little smaller than a typical mammalian cell (see
   figure). "Because every specific molecule absorbs a specific set of
   infrared wavelengths, the beam reflected from an individual cell yields
   a unique spectrum that can distinguish among different cell lines,
   different phases in the cell cycle, and the different chemical
   reactions and physical changes within cells," according to Michael
   Martin, a member of the Advanced Light Source research team at LBNL.
   The beam cank also be positioned with an accuracy of 1 µm, and a rapid
   pulse-repetition rate (2 ns between pulses) enables observation of
   rapid cell changes.

   In recent work, Holman and her collaborators have concentrated on the
   response of cultured human cells, including lines originated from lung
   and liver tissue, to low doses of environmental agents. "We studied
   changes in cells caused by oxidizing agents in dilute amounts typical
   of environmental exposure," she said. "Hydrogen peroxide is a strong
   oxidizer, and bleomycin is an antibiotic that is a weaker oxidizer but
   still damages DNA."

   Hydrogen peroxide causes predominantly single-strand breaks in DNA,
   while bleomycin induces a large number of double-strand breaks. Under
   SR-FTIR spectroscopy, damage from each chemical showed up as distinctly
   different spectral changes. In addition, the cell-wide damage caused by
   x-rays in lung cells produced a different spectroscopic signature
   compared to unexposed cells.

   "We also used the new technique to detect changes caused by dioxin in
   liver tumor cells," Holman said. The dioxin molecule binds to a
   specific receptor, which then binds to a site on the cell's DNA,
   regulating a gene that expresses one of the cytochromesproteins that
   catalyze the breakdown of aromatic carcinogens and other organic
   molecules.

   "Increasing the dose of dioxin caused marked changes in the SR-FTIR
   spectrum, but increasing a control compound that doesn't bind to that
   receptor didn't show these spectral changes," she said, indicating that
   dioxin's biological influence is related to its interaction with the
   binding site.

   By mapping biological and chemical reactions as they occur in
   individual living cells over a period of hours or daysin response to
   dilute, environmentally relevant concentrations of chemical substances
   and radiationthe new technique enables researchers to perform basic
   studies at the subcellular level.
