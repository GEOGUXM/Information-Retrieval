      [M.gif] ax Cleland is Georgias senior senator. He is a native Georgian
      who was born in Atlanta in 1942 and grew up in Lithonia. After
      graduating from Lithonia High School in 1960, he attended Stetson
      University where he joined the Armys ROTC program and majored in
      English. Upon graduation, he took a Second Lieutenants commission in
      the Army and went on to earn a Masters Degree in American History from
      Emory University. Both Stetson and Emory have since awarded Cleland
      Honorary Doctorate Degrees.

      After airborne training at Ft. Benning, Georgia and a tour as an Aide
      de Camp at Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey, Cleland volunteered for duty in
      Vietnam in 1967. In 1968, he was promoted to the rank of Captain, but
      was seriously wounded in a grenade explosion on April 8th of that year,
      costing him both legs and his right arm. Cleland returned home just one
      month prior to the end of his tour of duty, and spent the next year and
      a half recovering from his injuries in various Army and Veterans
      Administration hospitals. He has since been awarded the Bronze Star and
      a Silver Star for meritorious service in Vietnam.
      In 1969, Cleland was asked to testify before the United States Senate
      Veterans Affairs Committee to describe the difficulties veterans were
      experiencing returning home from Vietnam. The next year, Cleland was
      elected to the Georgia State Senate, thus beginning a thirty year
      career in public service. As the youngest member of the Georgia Senate
      at the age of 28, he wrote the state law making public facilities in
      the state accessible to the disabled.

      In 1975, Cleland was hired to work for the Senate Veterans Affairs
      Committee. Two years later, President Jimmy Carter appointed him to
      head the U.S. Veterans Administration. As the youngest ever VA
      administrator and the first Vietnam veteran to head the agency, Cleland
      instituted the revolutionary "Vets Center program" which for the first
      time offered psychological counseling to combat veterans, healing the
      emotional wounds of war in addition to the physical. There are now more
      than 200 Vets Centers across the country offering support to combat and
      non-combat veterans and their families.
      In 1982, Georgia voters elected him Secretary of State, the youngest in
      Georgias history. In that position, Cleland fought for tougher campaign
      finance laws and cracked down on securities and telemarketing fraud. In
      1995, he implemented the National Voter Registration Act ("motor
      voter") in Georgia, which added almost one million new voters to the
      rolls. In 1995, he resigned his position as Secretary of State to run
      for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring Senator Sam Nunn.
      Despite being out-spent three to one, Cleland won the race and was
      sworn-in to the United States Senate in 1997.

      Cleland currently serves on four Senate Committees: Armed Services;
      Commerce, Science and Transportation; Governmental Affairs; and Small
      Business. As the Chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee of the Armed
      Services Committee, Cleland has fought to improve the quality of life
      of our nations active duty, reserve and retired military personnel. He
      has lobbied to improve health care, education and retirement benefits
      and is also working to retain troops through enhancements to the
      Montgomery G.I. bill. By making benefits transferable to service
      members spouses and children, Cleland believes members can continue to
      serve their country while creating a college fund for their loved ones.
      In addition to his work on committees, Cleland is working to eliminate
      the punch card ballot nationwide, to pass a meaningful Patients Bill of
      Rights for the 161 millions Americans covered by managed health care,
      and to improve Americas schools through character education and
      additional resources for teacher training and certification.

      Cleland has received numerous awards in recognition of his service in
      the Senate, including the "Minute Man of the Year" award from the
      Reserve Officers Association. The Associations highest honor is awarded
      to two nominees each year for their leadership in military and national
      security issues. Past recipients include Presidents Bush, Reagan and
      Ford. Among Clelands other awards are the National Parks and
      Conservation Associations "Friend of the National Parks" award, the
      2000 Community Health Super Hero Award by the National Association of
      Community Health Centers, and the Vanguard Award from the Non
      Commissioned Officers Association.

      The Columbus Ledger Editorial Board wrote: "Grit, courage, and
      self-depricating humor have been among the qualities that have lit
      fires of leadership in Max Cleland... He brings energy and drive and
      passion to public service... Georgians are proud of the extraordinary
      man they have chosen to represent them in Washington..." A 1999 feature
      article in Esquire magazine titled "Hero in the Senate," said, "Max
      Cleland is an extraordinary man, an inspiration." Time magazine
      recognized Cleland as one of the country's Rising Democrats. The London
      Times said Cleland is "... rapidly becoming America's most
      extraordinary politician."
      Cleland is the author of two books, Going for the Max! 12 Principals
      for Living Life to the Fullest, and Strong at the Broken Places, which
      described his experiences in Vietnam and his recovery from his wounds.
      The second title was reprinted in 2000, after a Marine captain who also
      served in Vietnam contacted Cleland to let him know that the grenade
      which had caused his injuries in Khe Sahn was not his own, as he had
      assumed for thirty years.
      He is unmarried, and lives in Atlanta.
