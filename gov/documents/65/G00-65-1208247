   New York State Learning Standards

   At the approach of the twenty-first century, the Board of Regents
   approved a new set of learning standards for New York students. They
   represent the core of what all people should know, understand and be
   able to do as a result of their schooling. As such, these learning
   standards are to form the basis for a re-vision of education in New
   York.

   With this re-vision, children may expect an intellectually powerful
   education no matter where they live; in which teaching, assessment, and
   the provision of supports for learning are to be closely linked; and in
   which schools and parents share the same high expectations of
   youngsters.
