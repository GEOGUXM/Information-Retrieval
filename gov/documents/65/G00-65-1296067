Training Subgroup

   The primary objectives of the Training Subgroup are as follows:
    1. Maintain Agency capabilities in software technology. The NASA
       work-force will have the necessary skills to effectively manage
       software projects and apply software technology.
    2. Increase expertise in NASA software professionals by working with
       NASA's training office to establish a core set of training
       requirements for software project managers and software
       practitioners that support the goals of the NASA Software Strategic
       Plan.
    3. Review courses that exist within and outside the Agency, ensure
       against duplication, and facilitate development of a prioritized
       set of courses, if no alternative exists.
    4. Act as interface with other groups providing software training
       programs within and outside the Agency.
