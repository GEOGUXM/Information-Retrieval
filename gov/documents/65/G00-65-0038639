   Office of National Drug Control Policy Drug Policy Information
   Clearinghouse State of Indiana Profile of Drug Indicators December 2001
   ONDCP Drug Policy Information Clearinghouse staff compiled this profile
   by using the most recent data available from open sources. The data
   presented are as accurate as the sources from which they were drawn.
   The information contained in this profile should not be used to rank or
   compare States or jurisdictions, due to differences in data collection
   and reporting methods. Indiana The following profile contains
   information on demographics, political figures, funding, programs,
   crime, drug use, drug trafficking, and enforcement statistics.
   Demographics1 ÿ Population: 5,544,159 (1990 census); 6,080,485 (2000
   census) ÿ Age: 25.9% under 18 years old, 12.4% 65 years old or older ÿ
   Racial/Ethnic: White 87.5%; Black 8.4%; American Indian or Native
   Alaskan 0.3%; Asian 1%; and Hispanic Origin 3.5%. ÿ Percent of
   Population Below Poverty Level: 9.9% (1997 estimate) Politics2 ÿ
   Governor: Frank O'bannon ÿ Lt. Governor: Joseph E. Kernan ÿ Attorney
   General: Steve Carter ÿ U.S. Senate Members: Evan Bayh (D), Richard
   Lugar (R) ÿ U.S. House Members: Peter Visclosky (D), Mike Pence (R),
   Tim Roemer (D), Mark Souder (R), Steve Buyer (R), Dan Burton (R), Brian
   Kerns (R), John Hostettler (R), Baron Hill (D), Julia Carson (D)
   Programs/Initiatives ÿ The Lake County HIDTA was designated in 1996
   because the area had become a new staging ground for illicit drugs
   flowing from the Southwest and Los Angeles through Lake County and
   other destinations. The region is located in the extreme northwest
   corner of Indiana, directly east of Chicago. It consists of nineteen
   separated cities, towns and unincorporated areas within its boundaries.
   3 * Crack cocaine is the drug of choice in this county. Gary, Hammond,
   and East Chicago street gangs orchestrate the street level distribution
   of this drug. Lake County street gangs have loose alliances with
   Chicago based gangs, but many of these organizations do not follow any
   standard hierarchical formation. These Drug Trafficking Organizations
   (DTOs) in many cases are based on ad hoc relationships and their
   ability to purchase and distribute drugs profitably. Violence is used
   to control or expand their territory and to maintain internal controls,
   resulting in the extremely high rate of drug related homicides. * Lake
   County is a major distribution point for shipments of bulk marijuana
   and cocaine destined for the Midwest. As evidenced, 900 kilograms of
   marijuana and 400 kilograms of cocaine have recently been seized. Local
   and federal sources confirm that several Lake County DTOs have familial
   and business ties to Texas/Mexico DTOs. Lake County has also documented
   organizations with connections to Southeast United States DTOs.
   Additionally, a growing methamphetamine production and an increased
   number of imports into the State of Indiana present an increasing
   threat to our area. ONDCP Clearinghouse 2 ÿ In FY 2001, five community
   coalitions in Indiana received funding from the Drug Free Communities
   Support Program. The Coalitions are: Drug-Free Marion County received
   $100,000; Furthering Youth, Inc. and Harrison County received $61,730;
   Geminus Corporation dba Southlake Corporation received 99,125 Healthy
   Communities Initiative DFCC received 99,363 and Substance Abuse Council
   of Vanderburgh County received 100,000.4 ÿ Governor's commission for a
   Drug-Free Indiana was created in 1989 to develop a comprehensive
   statewide approach to alcohol and other drug problems. Through a
   network of field and support offices, the Commission assists local
   communities in the development of a community comprehensive plan to
   address these issues.5 ÿ The Indiana Prevention Resource Center (IPRC)
   at Indiana University is a statewide clearinghouse for prevention
   technical assistance and information about alcohol, tobacco, and other
   drugs for the State of Indiana. It is Indiana's officially designated
   RADAR Network (Regional Alcohol and Drug Awareness Resource Network)
   State Center.6 ÿ In 1998, the Indiana Department of Health created the
   Prenatal Substance Use Prevention Program (PSUPP), which is funded by
   the Indiana Division of Mental Health. The program aims to prevent and
   eliminate substance abuse among pregnant women before they need
   intensive treatment. PSUPP educates and counsels chemically dependent
   pregnant women about addiction, promoting abstinence and referring
   women to treatment services. PSUPP also targets the broader community.
   Staff train agencies and professionals to identify high-risk and
   chemically dependent women of childbearing age.7 ÿ The Indianapolis
   Weed and Seed was designated in January 1993 and is now known as the
   Near Westside Strategy. "Westside Cooperative Organization (WESCO) was
   resurrected to coordinate and integrate public and private initiatives,
   and to secure resources to be concentrated in the target neighborhood.
   The population of the Near Westside target area is 10,493 with a high
   incidence of violent crime and drug and gang related activities. The
   unemployment rate is 13 percent, the district school dropout rate is 23
   percent, and 29 percent of the residents live below the poverty level.
   Deterioration, lead-based paint, and substandard housing are major
   concerns: 50 percent of the housing units were built prior to World War
   II."8 * Since the Near Westside project's commencement, it has
   experienced many successes. Law enforcement activities, such as the
   Safe Streets Project, target neighborhoods with the highest rate of
   criminal activity. Residents continue to attend code enforcement
   meetings. Drug dealers are stopped from coming back to the
   neighborhoods by stay away orders. A pre-arrest targeting program
   called IMPACT has been implemented. The Community Policing Committee
   continues to meet monthly while the officers work closely with the
   Community Prosecutor and the courts. * "The Hawthorne Community Center
   Safe Haven continues to serve the community through provision of
   daycare, preschool, social services, emergency food pantry, structured
   teen activity organized sports, social activities, and senior citizens
   hot cooked lunch. The Single Parent's Support Group includes programs
   such as EFNEP, quilting instruction, exercise class, Indianapolis
   Neighborhood ONDCP Clearinghouse 3 Housing Partnership, and Asante
   Children's Theater while providing baby-sitting services. Teen
   basketball and baseball play an important role in youth activities as
   do the 500 Festival, WESCO Community Fair, and the Mini-Marathon. Also,
   the Westside Community Development Corporation continues to grow while
   providing much needed assistance to homeowners through its Families in
   Transition housing program. Finally, the Hammerwest project has taught
   the participants specific job related skills needed to enter the work
   force." Crime and Drug-Related Crime ÿ In Indiana, drug abuse
   violations increased between 1998 and 2000 from 15,769 to 33,728.9

   Drugs11 ÿ Cocaine Powered cocaine and crack cocaine are considerable
   drug threats to the state of Indiana. Although crack cocaine abuse is
   continually increasing in Indiana, it is increasing at a slower rate
   than in previous years. Powered cocaine is available throughout the
   northern part of the state and crack cocaine is available in the more
   rural southern parts of Indiana. Powered and crack cocaine purity
   levels range from 80 to 95 percent. Prices have decreased slightly from
   $90 t0 $85 per gram for powder, and $25 to $20 per rock (crack). ÿ
   Heroin Although heroin has previously not been a threat to Indiana,
   recent rates of use and distribution are on the rise. Purity levels for
   heroin are increasing and have been as high as 80%. Increases in purity
   levels have also lead to increases in demand, which have in turn lead
   to an increase in the number of addicts. ÿ Marijuana One of the most
   widely available and most frequently used drugs in Indiana is
   marijuana. Youth use rates decreased for most grade levels in 1999,
   primarily for eighth and tenth graders reporting using it at least once
   in the last year. Rural youth use marijuana more frequently than urban
   and suburban youth. Prices for marijuana have dropped from $180 per
   ounce in 1995 to $160 in 1999. ÿ Methamphetamine The growing number of
   methamphetamine lab seizures indicates an increasing drug problem in
   Indiana that may one-day rival the powered cocaine issues, which the
   state currently faces. Methamphetamine abuse has spread from rural to
   more urban areas and it accounts for 50% of drug overdoses in the Lake
   County HIDTA area of responsibility. A typical user may want to lose
   weight, or stay energized for an all night party or for their highly
   demanding job. Health officials indicate that the drug is mostly used
   by middle class, blue-collar Caucasians, but it is increasing in
   popularity among youth. Prices have decreased from $1,420 per ounce in
   1995 to $1,265 in 1999, which indicates increased availability. ÿ In
   1999, 7.5% of those surveyed in Indiana had used an illicit drug in the
   past month.12 Drug Use in the Past Month and Past Year, by Age Group,

   Indiana employed 1,941 employees in its police department in 2000. Of
   those employees, 1,262 were police officers and 679 were civilians. Of
   the total number of officers 68 were female.15 ONDCP Clearinghouse 6
   Production, Trafficking, and Seizures16 ÿ Mexican DTOs, which transport
   drugs into the state and are the primary distributors throughout the
   state, are an increasing threat to Indiana. Other groups that transport
   and distribute drugs in Indiana are independent Caucasian groups,
   street gangs, and outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMGs). ÿ The 2000 National
   Drug Threat Survey report showed increases in powered and crack cocaine
   related investigations, arrests, and seizures throughout the state.
   According to U.S. Customs Service (USCS), cocaine seizure events rose
   150% from 6 in 1998 to 15 in 1999. Street gangs usually transport
   powered cocaine to urban areas to be converted to crack cocaine. This
   reduces trafficker's chances of apprehension with crack cocaine, which
   would lead to harsher penalties. ÿ Texas and Arizona are the primary
   sources of heroin trafficking. Heroin is also transported, but to a
   lesser extent, from Chicago, Detroit, and the Southwest Border. ÿ
   Domestic cannabis growers are often heavily armed. Many times growers
   boobytrap their homes and surrounding areas to protect their grow
   sites. Marijuana is mostly cultivated by Caucasians in their early
   twenties. The DEA reports domestically grown marijuana to comprise
   25-30 percent of all marijuana distribution in the state. ÿ "The number
   of methamphetamine laboratories processed by the Indiana State Police
   forensics laboratory has doubled every year since 1994, with the
   exception of 1999, when they more than tripled." ÿ In Indiana, during
   2000, there were 28,886 marijuana plants eradicated.17 Cannabis

   all drug charges) followed by: methamphetamine (20.4%), powder cocaine
   (20.0%), marijuana (12.0%), and heroin (4.0%).18 ONDCP Clearinghouse 7
   Corrections19 ÿ As of January 2001, the State of Indiana Department of
   Corrections facilities held 20,125 adult offenders. Of all the
   offenders, 18.5% were charged with a drug related offense. Juvenile
   facilities in Indiana held 1,382 offenders, and 5.1% of them were
   charged with a drug-related offense. ÿ The number of female inmates has
   dramatically changed since 1990 when there were 681, compared to 2000
   where they accounted for 1,452.20 ÿ There were a total of 144,300
