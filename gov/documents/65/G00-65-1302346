   Vehicle Purchasing Tools

      The Office of Transportation Technologies would like to make buying
      alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles easy. After all, many
      types of these vehicles are available today and every one of these cars
      will help lower emissions and will bring us one step closer to easing
      the United States' dependence on foreign oil supplies. This page
      provides several tools to assist the general public and fleet managers
      in purchasing these vehicles.
