   This Web site is intended to offer various resources and tools that can
   be used to enhance compliance with the Export Administration
   Regulations (EAR).
   We encourage you to develop an EMS program that is tailored to your
   company's export/reexport transaction requirements. An EMS will create
   structure for your export activities, ensure consistency in export
   transaction decisions, streamline procedures and reduce your risk of
   violating the EAR. It is not a guarantee that a violation will not
   occur, but it is a map to consistent export compliance.
