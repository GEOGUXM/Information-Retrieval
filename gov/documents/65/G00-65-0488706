I.M.A.G.E. Consortium EST Projects

   [blue_green_line.gif]

   The I.M.A.G.E. Consortium has arrayed cDNA clones for various EST
   projects. All of the clones that are arrayed by I.M.A.G.E. are
   available royalty-free through our distributors, and all sequences
   obtained are submitted immediately to dbEST. The I.M.A.G.E. team at
   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is supported by the U.S.
   Department of Energy (Office of Biological and Environmental Research)
   and the National Cancer Institute.

   Merck/WashU EST Project
   (1995-1997)
   Human clones arrayed between 1995 and 1997 were sequenced by Washington
   University under the sponsorship of Merck. 584,000 ESTs from 5' and 3'
   reads were submitted to dbEST from this project.

   HHMI/WashU Mouse EST Project
   (1996-1998)
   Mouse clones arrayed between 1996 and 1998 were sequenced by Washington
   University under the sponsorship of the Howard Hughes Medical
   Institute. Nearly 400,000 ESTs, mostly 5' reads, were submitted to
   dbEST from this project.

   Cancer Genome Anatomy Project
   (1997-ongoing)
   Human clones arrayed from 1997 on, mostly from NCI-CGAP libraries, were
   sequenced by Washington University and the NIH Intramural Sequencing
   Center (NISC), under the sponsorship of the National Cancer Institute.
   Beginning in 1999, the CGAP project has also contributed libraries from
   other species, including mouse, rat, Xenopus, and primate.
   SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expression) libraries have also been
   included under the CGAP project. Sequencing of SAGE clones is done by
   Washington University and NISC, and analysis is done by the National
   Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

   WashU Zebrafish EST Project
   (1997-ongoing)
   cDNA libraries gathered from the zebrafish community have been arrayed
   by I.M.A.G.E. and other sources, and sequenced at Washington
   University.

   University of Iowa Rat EST Project
   (1998-ongoing)
   Clones from this project are arrayed and sequenced at the University of
   Iowa, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. Unique clones are
   rearrayed and given I.M.A.G.E cloneIDs (located in the comment field of
   the Genbank entry). 25,000 of these sequence-verified clones are
   currently available through the I.M.A.G.E. distributors.

   WashU Xenopus EST Project
   (1999-ongoing)
   cDNA libraries gathered from the Xenopus community as well as
   constructed by CGAP have been arrayed by I.M.A.G.E. and other sources,
   and sequenced at Washington University.

   Mammalian Gene Collection
   (1999-ongoing)
   The focus of the MGC project, sponsored by the National Institutes of
   Health, is to generate full-length cDNA resources for human and other
   mammalian species. Initially, clones from MGC libraries are sequenced
   from the 5' and 3' ends, and evaluated for full-length characteristics.
   Prospective full-length clones are rearrayed, verified, and then fully
   sequenced.
