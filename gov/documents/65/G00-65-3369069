   The NIH Director's Wednesday Afternoon Lectures Series includes weekly
          scientific talks by some of the top researchers in the
          biomedical sciences worldwide. All lectures are held in Jack
          Masur Auditorium, Building 10 of the NIH main campus, and are
          open to the public. Unless indicated otherwise, the lectures
          begin at 3:00 p.m. During previous years, Continuing Medical
          Education credits have been awarded for participation in the
          WALS*. The lectures may be accessed from personal computers via
          NIH's MBONE and are available on videotape at the NIH Library,
          Bldg. 10, approximately one week after the lecture date. For
          sign language and reasonable accommodation, or for further
          information, contact Hilda Madine, phone 301-594-5595. For

   ***The NIH/FAES is accredited by the Accreditation Council for
          Continuing Medical Education to sponsor continuing medical
          education for physicians.

   In previous years, the NIH/FAES designated this educational activity
          for a maximum of 1 hour per lecture in category 1 credit towards
          the AMA Physician's Recognition Award. Each physician should
          claim only those hours of credit actually spent in the
          educational activity.

   In previous years, the CME learning objective for the WALS was to
   highlight key research questions and some of the approaches speakers
   are taking to address the questions.
