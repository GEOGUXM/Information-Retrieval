   California WorkNet - One-Stop Career Center System

   CALIFORNIA WORKNET
   California WorkNet connects you to employment, education, and training
   services provided through local, State, and federal programs. The
   WorkNet system itself is comprised of One-Stop Career Centers
   throughout California. These centers include partner programs such as
   Unemployment Insurance, Job Services, Vocational Education, Vocational
   Rehabilitation, and Youth programs.
   WorkNet is the name for Californias One-Stop Career Center System, a
   statewide network of conveniently located centers that each provide
   employment, education, and training services all in one place. Certain
   One-Stop Career Centers have all employment, training, and education
   partners and their programs on-site, while others have only selected
   partners and programs on-site. Some of the One-Stop Career Centers are
   referred to as "kiosks". These kiosk locations usually are self-service
   and have no staff available for assistance. Regardless of the type of
   One-Stop Career Center you visit, though, all related services and/or
   information are available through that location.
   One-Stop Career Centers are established and maintained as parts of your
   local communities. They are conveniently located and provide a wealth
   of information and assistance for job seekers, education and training
   seekers, and employers. All members of your community, including
   persons with disabilities and persons with limited English-speaking
   ability, are welcome to use the One-Stop Career Centers.
