   We invite you to explore job opportunities here at this great national
   laboratory. Berkeley Lab is located in the hills overlooking the campus
   of the University of California at Berkeley. Altogether, we have some
   4,000 employees, of which about 600 are students. Each year, the Lab
   also hosts more than 2,000 participating guests. We are managed by the
   University of California for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).

   The Laboratory's principal role for DOE is fundamental science,
   including developing powerful experimental and computational systems
   for exploring properties of matter, deepening understanding of
   molecular interactions and synthesis, and gaining insights into
   biological molecules, cells, and tissues. The Laboratory is a major
   contributor of research on energy resources, including the earth's
   structure and energy reservoirs, fusion, combustion of fuels, and keys
   to efficient energy storage and use. Berkeley Lab performs extensive
   environmental research, including subsurface contaminant transport,
   bioremediation and indoor air quality.
