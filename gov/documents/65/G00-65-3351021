                        Development Opportunities for

                         Transdisciplinary Sciences

   Transdisciplinary Sciences includes training and career development for
       those disciplines that are normally regarded as outside of
       traditional behavioral and biomedical cancer research and/or
       training and career development in those areas of cancer research
       that will require individuals to conduct their research within
       highly inter-disciplinary, collaborative team settings. For these
       purposes, the NCI currently offers the following opportunities:

    1. The Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award (K25):
       These are awards for independent scientists in highly technical
       fields of research to identify an appropriate mentor with extensive
       experience in cancer research and to receive the necessary training
       and career development required to become involved in
       multidisciplinary cancer research. The NCI participates in the NIH
       program, which uses the K25 grant mechanism and is dedicated to
       this goal. The announcement for this NIH program can be accessed at
       the following website address:

    2. Cancer Education and Career Development Program (R25T):
       The Cancer Education and Career Development Program or R25T grant
       is a program developed uniquely by the National Cancer Institute to
       encourage institutions to develop training programs that are
       multi-departmental and/or multi-institutional and focused on
       preparing predoctoral and postdoctoral candidates to conduct cancer
       research in team settings that are highly-interdisciplinary and
       collaborative. These programs are intended to serve a wide range of
       research areas (e.g., imaging, pathology, pharmacogentics
       biophysics, bioinformatics etc.) that will require sustained
       leadership, dedicated faculty time, specialized curriculum
       development and implementation, interdisciplinary research
       environments and more than one mentor per program participant.
