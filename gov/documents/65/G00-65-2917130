   The U.S. Geological Survey provides the Nation with reliable, impartial
   information to describe and understand the Earth. In California, these
   issues include natural hazards, such as earthquakes and floods, and the
   effects on water resources of population growth and industrial and
   agricultural development.

   The USGS Water Resources has the principal responsibility within the
   Federal Government to provide the hydrologic information and
   understanding needed by others to achieve the best use and management
   of the Nation's water resources.
