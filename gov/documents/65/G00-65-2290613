   Introduction

   FoodSafety.gov is a gateway website that provides links to selected
   government food safety-related information. Not every government web
   site is listed. When more than one government web site provides similar
   information, links will be provided to only one or two of those sites.
   A steering committee consisting of individuals with different
   backgrounds reviews all potential sites for inclusion on the
   FoodSafety.gov web site. This web site is part of the National Food
   Safety Information Network. It is maintained by FDA's Center for Food
   Safety and Applied Nutrition.

   The logo, "From Farm to Table," indicates that food safety is a shared
   responsibility of government, industry, and the consumer. This shared
   responsibility is especially well-expressed by the California
   Department of Food & Agriculture web site:

     "When we discuss food safety issues, we must consider the important
     role each link of the food chain plays in ensuring a safe food
     supply. The entire chain includes growers, packers, shippers, food
     handlers, processors, retailers and consumers. If a link in that
     chain is broken, it threatens the safety and integrity of our food
     supply. That's why we must work together to improve how we
     communicate public health messages to the entire food chain..."

   Limitations

   Although we have made reasonable efforts to assure that we link to
   sites that provide accurate and up to date information, the
   FoodSafety.gov web site does not control the content of the internet
   sites listed. It does not review or endorse any of the information in
   those sites.

   FoodSafety.gov is a referral service only and is not intended to be
   used to diagnosis medical conditions, offer medical advice, or endorse
   specific products or services.
