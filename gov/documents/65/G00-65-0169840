                  Education Freedom Means Higher Student Achievement

   Dear Colleague:

   Parents of all income levels deserve the opportunity to choose the best
   education possible for their children. And as the attached Wall Street
   Journal op-ed by the Manhattan Institute's Dr. Jay Greene notes, the
   more choices parents have, the more likely their children are to learn.

   Last year, Congress took significant bipartisan action to expand
   choices for low-income parents -- creating expanded Education Savings
   Accounts (Coverdell accounts) that help parents pay for K-12
   educational expenses and both private and public schools, and giving
   parents with children in chronically-failing public schools the right
   to choose a private tutor and a better-achieving public or charter
   school.

   This year, Republicans and Democrats in Congress must build on this
   solid foundation by taking further action to expand parental choice in
   education. The drive for equal educational opportunity in America
   doesn't end with President Bush's signing of the No Child Left Behind
   Act; it begins there.

   School Choice = Higher Test Scores
   By Jay P. Greene
   Wall Street Journal, January 23, 2002

   In the U.S., the government does not, in general, restrict how families
   raise their children -- does not prescribe what clothes they should
   wear, what food they should eat, or what books they should read. Our
   states do vary widely, however, in the degree of freedom parents are
   permitted to decide how their children are educated. Given that
   education is really just an extension of child-rearing, it is curious
   that liberty is granted in one arena while often restricted in the
   other.

   The traditional justification for restricting freedom in education has
   been the assertion of a compelling public interest -- that the
   interests of society are better served when the state plays the role of
   educator. Evidence presented in the Manhattan Institute's new 2001
   Education Freedom Index, however, provides further proof that the
   public interest in education is better served by more freedom, not
   less.

   The index measures four types of educational freedom: the ability of
   parents to pursue charter school options, subsidized private schools,
   public school choice and home-schooling. The results vary widely.

   More than a dozen states do not permit charter schools at all, while in
   Arizona nearly one-quarter of all public schools are chartered. In nine
   states, vouchers or tax-credits are available to assist parents in
   choosing a private school, while 13 states do not offer any form of
   assistance, not even textbooks, transportation, or medical services, to
   families in private schools.

   In some states choosing a different public school district is made
   easier by the fact that districts are numerous and small or by the
   existence of interdistrict transfer programs, while in Hawaii the
   entire state is a single school district. Parents unhappy with their
   school district in the Aloha State have to move to another state. In
   some states, such as Idaho, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Texas,
   the regulatory burden placed on parents choosing home-schooling is
   relatively modest, while in other states, such as Massachusetts, Rhode
   Island, and Utah, the regulations are quite onerous.

   Because the range of educational options varies from state to state it
   is possible to examine whether greater education freedom is associated
   with better academic outcomes. Holding constant other factors that may
   influence academic performance, such as household income, race, and per
   pupil spending, states that offer greater education freedom have
   significantly higher student test scores.

   A two-point increase in the Education Freedom Index score for a state,
   roughly the difference between top-ranked Arizona and bottom-ranked
   Hawaii, yields an additional 8% of students performing proficiently on
   the U.S Department of Education's National Assessment of Educational
   Progress math test. Just think, without changing anything else --
   without spending a dime more, without eradicating poverty -- states
   could significantly increase academic performance simply by offering
   families additional options.

   States with the most education freedom also exhibited the most
   improvement in test scores during the 1990s. For example, Minnesota,
   which ranks fifth in the index, increased the percentage of its
   students performing proficiently on the math NAEP by 17% during the
   1990s, almost double the rate of increase nationally. Minnesota's
   neighbor, North Dakota, which ranks 44th, only increased the percentage
   performing proficiently on the math NAEP by 4%. Gov. Jeb Bush in
   Florida is spearheading efforts to increase education freedom. Just in
   the past year, Florida initiated or expanded a series of educational
   options for parents. The state revised its McKay Scholarships program
   that offers vouchers to special needs students with which they can
   attend a private school, resulting in a dramatic increase in
   enrollment. The state also initiated a significant corporate tax credit
   for donations to funds that provide low-income students with private
   school scholarships. And the state continues to expand its charter
   school offerings as well as continue its A-Plus accountability and
   choice program, which offers vouchers to students at schools if the
   schools chronically fail to offer an acceptable quality education.

   These programs have propelled Florida from 35th to fourth place in the
   Education Freedom Index. According to the statistical analysis in the
   report, this should result in an additional 2% of Florida students
   performing proficiently on the math NAEP test. This may not sound like
   a big leap but it is. The state would have to increase per pupil
   spending by more than 20% to realize the same gain in test scores,
   according to the statistical model. It certainly costs much less to
   offer parents some additional choices.

   More effective and less costly: Who could possibly oppose education
   freedom?
