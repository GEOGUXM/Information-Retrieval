     Now that you've targeted your market and determined which segment of
     the government is the right customer for you, selling to the government
     is just like selling to any private company. You have to know who the
     most likely customer is and then you need to figure out a way to sell
     to them.

     Where do I start?
     Register your business with Federal government contractor databases!
     The three main government registries are:
       * PRO-Net
       * Central Contractor Registration (CCR)
       * Fedbizopps.gov (formerly Electronic Posting System (EPS))

     IMPORTANT: Some Federal departments and agencies have their own
     contractor databases. You must contact each department or agency you
     want to do business with to determine if they have a separate
     contractor registry database.

     PRO-Net
     PRO-Net is THE contractor registry for small businesses. By registering
     in PRO-Net, your women-owned business is instantly accessible to every
     Federal government contracting officer. Registering in PRO-Net is just
     a few clicks away. The online application is easy-to-understand and
     takes just a few minutes to complete.

     Central Contractor Registration (CCR)
     Have you thought about selling your product or service to the
     Department of Defense (DOD)? If not, think about the fact that DOD is
     the largest Federal purchaser, spending 120 billion dollars a year on
     prime contracts.

     If you want to do business with DOD, you must register with CCR. CCR
     offers a one-time online application form and a toll free assistance
     center.

     FedBizOpps
     Want to receive procurement announcements directly to your e-mail
     address? Then register for GSA's free multi-agency electronic posting
     service for solicitations, requirements, awards and other
     acquisition-related documents.
     When registering for this service, please keep in mind that if you
     elect to receive all procurement notices, it will result in the
     transmission of over 600 e-mail messages per month.
