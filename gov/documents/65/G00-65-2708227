                             Music

   From the lullabies that helped us sleep, to the processional at a
   graduation, music is a part of us.  Here at the Washington State School
   for the Blind (WSSB), music is not only a class or a tool, but also a
   way of life.  Music is a subject in which blindness does not
   interfere.  Strategies may change, but the result is the same.
   Beautiful notes ringing throughout the air.  Students at WSSB receive
   music braille instruction, elementary general music, three levels of
   bands, an honors choir and music theory.

   Out of Sight is the WSSBs jazz combo.  They perform on and off campus
   with the proficiency of mature musicians.  The band consists of a
   guitar, bass, drums, keyboards, trumpet, clarinet and occasionally, a
   vocalist.  Out of Sight works daily on jazz standards, while the Rock
   Combo, (a second year band) performs the rock favorites of yesterday
   and today.  WSSB also has a beginning band that learns a mixture of
   rock, jazz and concert style music.

   In Harmony, the honors choir, is in their fourth year of existence.
   Since their creation they have taken the choral world by storm.Although
   their numbers have remained few, their sound has always been mighty.
   The members have to pass a rigorous audition and once in the ensemble,
   they must maintain good grades in all their classes, practice daily and
   give service to the community.

   Most choirs rely on the musical notes from a page and their directors
   hands to lead them.  This ensemble has had to learn how to read braille
   music and follow the sound of their directors breath for their
   entrances and cut offs.  A very difficult challenge, but this choir is
   known for their precision and musical emotion.

   In Harmony performs regularly at their school, but also at Senior
   Centers, the Shriners Hospital, public and private schools, Lions
   clubs, private social events, benefit concerts, churches, and other
   service organizations.

   In Harmony
   is currently preparing for a tour of the East Coast.  It has been in
   the planning process since their return from their West Coast tour in
   2000.  They will be performing at Peabody and Julliard Conservatories,
   five schools for the blind, The Capitol, Hershey Park, and at a variety
   of other sites.  Tours are very costly and In Harmony has been running
   many fund raisers.  But after the tragedy on September 11, 2001, In
   Harmony donated all the proceeds from their September 20th benefit
   concert to the American Red Cross.
