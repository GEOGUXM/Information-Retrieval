                          [N01%20u.s.%201Mar96.jpg]

   Coordinates activities relating to all external beamlines and their
   target stations and absorbers within the accelerator complex. The
   department has responsibility for:

     * Performance specifications, configuration, monitoring, and
       operational support of:

                       External Target Stations and Beam Absorbers at
   Fermilab
                       P3 Beamline and Switchyard
                       120 GeV Experimental Areas Beamlines
     * Design of a 120 GeV fixed target program

     * Design and construction of the NuMI proton line to the production
       target

     * Design and construction of the MiniBooNE beam line

     * Design and construction of a charged kaon beam utilizing a
       superconducting RF separator

     * Assisting the relevant System Department with Resonant and Fast
       Extraction from the Main Injector and Tevatron
