                          Age and Growth of Sharks

   The Shark Age and Growth Laboratory at the Panama City Laboratory is
   responsible for ageing a variety of small, large, and pelagic shark
   species in support of stock assessments. Because sharks lack hard parts
   (i.e. useable scales and otoliths), information on age and growth in
   sharks is derived from counts of opaque and translucent bands on the
   vertebral centra or spines. Vertebral sections are obtained through
   research cruises, recreational fishers and through collection by
   onboard observers on commercial fishing vessels.

Methodology

   CAPTION:

   [shark vertebrae]
   Sagittal section of a finetooth vertebral centrum

   Preparation of vertebrae for ageing involves removal of excess tissue
   with a scalpel and soaking in a sodium hypochlorite solution. After
   cleaning, the vertebrae are stored in 95% isopropanol alcohol.
   Several methods can be used to enhance visibility of growth bands.
   Vertebrae can be cut in half sagittally or alternatively, thin sagittal
   sections of various thicknesses can be obtained from the centrum.
   Sections can be stained to enhance the growth bands with crystal
   violet, silver nitrate, alizarin red or other stains. Sections can also
   be left unstained. Sections are typically examined under a dissecting
   microscope interfaced with an image analysis system. A wide variety of
   additional techniques have been used to estimate the age of sharks. A
   review of those methods is provided by Cailliet et al. (1990).

Analysis

   The most commonly used model to represent growth in sharks is the von
   Bertalanffy growth equation: L[t] = L[inf] (1-exp^(-K(t-to))) where
   L[t]= length at age t in years, L[inf] = maximum theoretical length, K
   = growth coefficient (yr^-1) t[0] = theoretical age at zero length.
   However, other models that have been used include Gompertz,
   exponential, and logistic curves. In most cases, the rationale for
   model preparation is to allow prediction of an expected mean size at
   age or growth rate at a given age, or to facilitate comparisons of
   estimated growth with other published age and growth estimates.
   Calculations of growth rate are based on equations derived from
   accepted growth models fitted to empirical data. Growth models can be
   fitted to actual observed ages (counts of growth bands are generally
   assumed to represent one year of age) or to back-calculated ages.
   Back-calculations are used to estimate shark length at previous ages.
   Since the shark length-vertebral radius relationship can be determined,
   the distance between the growth increments can be used to calculate
   yearly growth rates of the shark.

   Growth rates and growth dynamics estimated for sharks vary widely.
   Generally, K values derived for species of small coastal sharks (e.g.,
   bonnethead, Atlantic sharpnose, blacknose shark) range from 0.3-0.7
   yr^-1, whereas values for large coastal sharks (e.g., sandbar,
   blacktip, dusky shark) range from 0.04-0.3 yr^-1. Pelagic sharks (e.g.,
   blue, thresher, mako shark) have K values ranging from 0.04-0.4 yr^-1 .

   The following age and growth projects are currently underway in our
   laboratory, or in collaboration with other institutions. Reprints of
   completed projects are available by contacting the senior author.

   * Age, growth, and mortality estimates of the finetooth shark: a small
   coastal species?

   * Geographic variation in age and growth among populations of
   bonnethead shark

   * Revised age and growth rates of blacktip and spinner sharks after
   population decline: evidence of compensatory mechanisms?

   * Density-dependent regulation in Atlantic sharpnose sharks
