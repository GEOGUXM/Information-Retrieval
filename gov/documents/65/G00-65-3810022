The Records Center Program

     Who We Are And What We Do

     Since 1934, the National Archives has provided comprehensive records
     management support and archival guidance and services to the Federal
     Government. Since the opening of the National Archives and Records
     Administration's (NARA) first records center in 1950, NARA has
     developed its records center system into a national network of
     fifteen facilities storing, and providing access to, 21 million
     boxes of records.

     The Records Center Program, as an essential component of NARA, is
     dedicated to providing superior records storage, access, and
     disposition services. This integrated approach yields great benefits
     to you, the customer, as NARA is an active participant from the
     creation of your records through their disposition. The program is
     administered by a professional staff that is familiar with your
     agency, your records, and your records management needs.

     We are a cost effective organization committed to providing quality
     customer service using the latest information technology systems at
     record center locations nationwide, governed by Public Law 106-58.
