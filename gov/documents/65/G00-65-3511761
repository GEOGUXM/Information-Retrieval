   The recently-concluded World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial at
   Doha gave new impetus to the ongoing WTO negotiations on services,
   including telecommunications services. The U.S. Government delegation
   expects to begin bilateral discussions on telecom services with WTO
   member states in March and in June to describe the barriers we want our
   trading partners to remove.
   The Office of Telecommunications Technologies, U.S. Department of
   Commerce, welcomes comments from companies regarding existing barriers
   or restrictions to the entry and provision of telecom services in
   foreign markets. These barriers or restrictions may include legal and
   regulatory restrictions or policies and practices affecting the
   establishment of a telecom business, personnel, procurement, and
   preferences. They also may include provisions regarding monopolies,
   standards, and general business practices. Comments should indicate the
   market (country) involved and can be submitted by e-mail to Dan
   Edwards, Telecom Services Specialist, or faxed to (202) 482-5834. We
   welcome all comments from U.S. firms, preferably by February 1, 2002.
   For questions, please call Dan at (202) 482-4331.
