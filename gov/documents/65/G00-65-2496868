         The MISSION of the Environmental Carbon Observatory is to quantify the
         fluxes of carbon between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, and
         the processes regulating those fluxes in order to:

   [smallbullett.gif] Contribute to improved predictions of atmospheric
   CO[2] and climate change.
   [smallbullett.gif] Provide a scientific basis for using agriculture,
   forestry and natural ecosystems to offset CO[2] emissions.
   [smallbullett.gif] Make possible the early warning of large scale,
   rapid, undesirable changes in the coupled atmosphere-biosphere system

   The GOAL of the Environmental Carbon Observatory is to address major
   gaps in knowledge of the global carbon cycle that hamper our ability to
   predict:

   [smallbullett.gif] If and how climate will change.
   [smallbullett.gif] The impacts of climate change on agriculture,
                      forestry and natural ecosystems.
   [smallbullett.gif] How such impacts on natural ecosystems may moderate
                      or intensify climate change.

   ECO will be an extraordinary tool for visualizing global patterns and
   processes of carbon sequestration and flux. ECO will result in
   extraordinary science at the global scale. ECO will provide a major,
   new facility for a large user community. ECO will provide new data
   based on sound logic for the protection of the living planet.
