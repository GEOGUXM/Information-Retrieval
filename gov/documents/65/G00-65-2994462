                           Metasystem Transition Theory

      Metasystem Transition Theory (MSTT) is the name we have given our
      particular cybernetic philosophy. Its most salient concept is, of
      course, the Metasystem Transition (MST), the evolutionary process by
      which higher levels of complexity and control are generated. But it
      also includes our views on philosophical problems, and makes
      predictions about the possible future of mankind and life. Our goal is
      to create, on the basis of cybernetic concepts, an integrated
      philosophical system, or "world view", proposing answers to the most
      fundamental questions about the world, ourselves, and our ultimate
      values.

      Our methodology to build this complete philosophical system is based on
      a "bootstrapping" principle: the expression of the theory affects its
      content and meaning, and vice versa. In this way we aim to apply the
      principles of cybernetics to their own development. Our philosophy too
      is based on cybernetic principles. Our epistemology understands
      knowledge as a model, which is constructed by the subject or group, but
      undergoes selection by the environment. Our metaphysics asserts actions
      as ontological primitives. On the basis of this ontology, we define the
      most important concepts and organize them in a semantic network. At a
      higher level, we also lay out the fundamental principles of cybernetics
      in terms of these underlying concepts.

      One of the central concepts is that of evolution in the most general
      sense, which is produced by the mechanism of variation and selection.
      Another is control, which we define in a special cybernetic sense, and
      assert as the basic mode of organization in complex systems. This
      brings us to the central concept for MSTT, that of the metasystem
      transition, or the process by which control emerges in evolutionary
      systems.

      On this basis we then reconstruct the complete history of evolution,
      from the Big Bang to the present, as a sequence of MST's. An
      extrapolation of this sequence provides us with a first glimpse of what
      the future might bring. Finally, the possible dangers and opportunities
      of our evolutionary future direct our attention to the need for
      formulating an ethics, based on evolutionary and systemic principles,
      that could guide our actions.

   Background of the theory

      The concept of the metasystem transition was introduced in Turchin's
      book The Phenomenon of Science, which was followed by
      [externallink.GIF] Inertia of Fear and the Scientific Worldview. The
      basic tenets of MSTT were formulated by Turchin and Joslyn in "The
      Cybernetic Manifesto". As Heylighen joined the Editorial Board, the
      work on MSTT intensified, and the Principia Cybernetica Web was
      created. A major collection of papers on MSTT by the three editors and
      invited authors was published in a special issue of the journal World
      Futures entitled "The Quantum of Evolution". MSTT is also being applied
      to computer science and the foundations of mathematics by Turchin and
      his colleagues. The bibliography of PCP includes most publications on
      MSTT.
