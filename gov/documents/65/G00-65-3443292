   A WebBook is a way of organizing many interconnected Web pages into an
   easy-to-read collection of chapters and pages, much like a paper book.
   But a WebBook has the advantages of being easy-to-search and can be
   distributed via the Web or CDROM to Macs, PCs, or Unix computers. A
   Kiosk Mode automatic page-turning feature provides a continuous
   presentation of the next page every few seconds like a slide-show.

Reading a WebBook

   A Web site that has been setup as a WebBook has a control panel added
   to every page that looks like:

                            [wbheaderhelp72.gif]

    NOTE: This control panel can vary in appearance and not all features
                       are implemented in all WebBooks

   You can read through a WebBook page-by-page simply by clicking the Next
   Page or Previous Page arrow buttons, like turning pages in a book. The
   Home Page button takes you to the book's overall Table of Contents
   (i.e. the "home page" of a Web site).

   The colored Position Bar shows how far you are through the book, and
   can be clicked to go directly to any particular page in the book. Try
   rolling your mouse over the color bar and looking down at the status
   line of your browser (the status line is usually at the bottom of the
   window) to see which page you will go to.

   The WebBook Title and Chapter Title are shown in the center. The
   Chapter Title is optional, and may be clickable to go to a Table of
   Contents just for that Chapter. A small Book or Site Logo ("GLOBE" in
   our example above) may be used to provide a link back to an originating
   Web site. The WebBook Logo provides a link to a page for help and
   general information on WebBooks.

   The Last Modified Date is displayed next to the page number and is the
   date of the most recent change to that page. Above that date there may
   be an optional "Kiosk" button for automatic page turning: a continuous
   presentation of the next page every few seconds like a slide-show.
   Another optional button can be for a special page related to the
   current one: usually this is an Adobe PDF Page icon, indicating a PDF
   version of this same page that is suitable for printing or zooming in
   for viewing details not visible in the plain HTML (PDF pages also allow
   you to see the page exactly as they were when printed on paper).
   Different WebBooks may use this space for other purposes or not at all.

Searching a WebBook

   Some WebBooks may allow searching through all their text. If so, they
   will have an additional "footer" that looks like this:

    ____________________ Search Options (*) This Chapter ( ) Entire Book

   Since WebBooks can be organized by Book and Chapter, they may also be
   searched that way. Sometimes, especially in large books (or Web sites),
   a simple search returns too many pages. Hence, we have provided a way
   to limit searches to just one Chapter. Simply go to any page in that
   chapter, and type in the word you are looking for, and select the "This
   Chapter" button before clicking "Search".

   More specific searches are available by clicking the "Options" link.
   This takes you to a page with many search options including:
     * Case sensitive: e.g. find "Boulder", but not "boulder"
     * Partial word match: e.g. find all words containing "temp"
       ("temperature", "temporary", etc.)
     * Misspellings: e.g. find even misspelled words ("tmparature")

The WebBook Concept

   The Web has introduced us all to the power of "hypertext", and Web
   sites are often marvelous "hierarchies" of information. Still, there
   are times that you just wish you could go through all or many of the
   pages in sequence, instead of always having to click the Web browser's
   "BACK" button to return to a "home" page, then click again on another
   page link -- over and over again.

                          [webbook-depth-first.gif]

              Navigating an entire Web site the "hypertext" way

   A WebBook uses a Book and Chapter metaphor that we are all familiar
   with. It allows visitors to view the entire site page-by-page in
   sequence, or even jump quickly to any page, much like we can do with
   paper books. Sometimes, especially in educational and story-telling
   material, the old-fashioned sequential book model actually works better
   than "hypertext". And just quickly scanning a bunch of pages by
   "thumbing" through them in a WebBook is much easier than navigating up
   and down a complex hierarchy (all that extra mouse-clicking and page
   redrawing can be very distracting!).

                            [webbook-serial.gif]

               Navigating an entire Web site the "WebBook" way

   A WebBook doesn't lose the original hypertext structure of a Web site
   -- it preserves it, while adding a new, sequential way to view the
   site. It unties the "Gordian Knot" of a complicated hypertext structure
   into a straight "thread" of information!

Creating your own WebBook

   You can easily build your own WebBook by just providing a list of pages
   anywhere on the Web. In this way you can create "tours" of favorite or
   related Web pages, with slide show capability and full-text
   searchability.

   The WebBook Creator page:

     http://wist.ngdc.noaa.gov/webbook/wbcreator

   lets you simply paste in a list of page URLs, choose your features, and
   click to create a live WebBook with no knowledge of Web programming.

     If you wish more flexibility, and have access to a Unix-based Web
     server, then you can use our webbook.pl Perl script to customize and
     build WebBooks with your own look-and-feel, to host on your own Web
     server. For more details on other ways to build WebBooks, see:
     http://webbook.ngdc.noaa.gov/~fozzard/documentation/wb

    Frame Support

   IMPORTANT NOTE: The WebBook tool does not currently support web pages
   using "frames". Please let us know if frame support is important to
   you. In the meantime, please consider if frames are really important to
   your presentation; there are some serious drawbacks to using them (see
   Jakob Nielsen's "Why Frames Suck..." at:
   http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9612.html)

   The WebBook concept was developed by Richard Fozzard
   (fozzard@ngdc.noaa.gov) at the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC),
   a part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
   The work was supported by the Global Learning and Observations to
   Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE), and was developed for the
   purposes of science education and in consultation with K-12 teachers in
   that Program.

   There is a Technical Tutorial paper given at WebShop '97 that provides
   more details on WebBooks and how to create them:
   WebBook: "Thumbing" Through a Good Web Site

   The WebBook tool was used to create the GLOBE Teacher's Guide, the
   Grand Winner of The Best Web Page in NOAA award!

   WebBook shares some features and concepts with Metalog, and future
   plans for WebBook might include capabilities from Metalog.
