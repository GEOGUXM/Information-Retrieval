   State Agency Partnership Announces
   New Television Series to Help Utah Workers

   The Utah State Office of Educations Adult Education program, Utah
   Education Network, Utah State Office of Rehabilitation, and Department
   of Workforce Services (Utahs Job Connection) are pleased to announce
   their cooperative effort to present Workplace Essential Skills, an
   extraordinary new public television series that teaches the attitudes
   and competencies necessary for success at work. The purpose of
   Workplace Essential Skills is to show how adults use basic skills to
   find jobs and how they use those skills in realistic workplace
   settings. This unique training series builds the confidence and skills
   of those who are ready to find and keep a job as a steppingstone to a
   better life. Workplace Essential Skills focuses on the needs of those
   who are unemployed, underemployed, or new to the world of work. The
   series teaches basic job search, reading, writing, math, and
   communication skills.

   Although it is designed to help the independent viewer, Workplace
   Essential Skills is a comprehensive training resource that many
   organizations and employers can use as part of the classes, workshops,
   training, and outreach programs that help individuals help themselves
   to a better tomorrow. The series is designed for adults who dont have
   jobs as well as those who wish to move from entry-level work to higher
   paying positions and careers. The goals of the partnership in
   broadcasting the series are:<br>
     * To provide educators, employment counselors, and employers with a
       high quality resource for preparing Utahns for a productive work
       life;
     * To help Utahns who are unemployed, underemployed, or disabled
       develop essential skills for finding and keeping a job; and
     * To support welfare-to-work initiatives and other programs that
       provide individuals with the skills and resources for becoming
       independent and productive members of society.

   With money from a federal award grant, the partnership of state
   agencies purchased broadcast rights to Workplace Essential Skills for
   five years. Utah Education Network will broadcast the series throughout
   the state each semester. The series consists of 24 half-hour episodes.
   The first eight episodes are designed to:
     * Enhance the learners chances of finding a job and of developing
       short- and long-term career goals, with an emphasis on reading,
       writing, math, communication, and problem-solving skills, and to
     * Enhance the learners chances of making a good impression, making
       the most of the introductory/training period on the job, and
       growing into and with the job.

   The remaining 16 instructional episodes are designed to help learners
   develop basic skills in reading, writing, math, problem solving, and
   communication. The skills content in each program is introduced and
   demonstrated via scenarios drawn from four workplace contexts:
   construction, manufacturing, healthcare, and retail/service. An
   orientation episode for students rounds out the series.

   The inaugural broadcast of Workplace Essential Skills will air
   beginning 4 January 2001 and run through March 2002. Double episodes
   will show for the first time each Friday at 6:00 p.m. and repeat on
   Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7:00 to 7:30 a.m. For a complete, detailed
   scheduled and information about where to tune in, visit the Workplace
   Essential Skills site on the Web at jobs.utah.gov or call (801)
   526-9905.
