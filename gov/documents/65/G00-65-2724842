   Overview
   Transit Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is an element of the
   U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) National ITS Program. Transit
   ITS is a comprehensive approach to applying information technologies to
   transit to improve customer service and reduce system capital and
   operating costs.

   Transit ITS is organized in parallel with the U.S. DOT National ITS
   Program and has three components: Metropolitan, Rural, and Transit
   Intelligent Vehicle Initiative (IVI). The U.S. DOT National ITS Program
   also includes a Commercial Vehicle Operations component. The
   Metropolitan component of Transit ITS focuses on urban and suburban
   transportation in the areas of Traveler Information, Transit Management
    and Electronic Payment.

   The Rural component addresses these same areas to improve the
   effectiveness of transit in rural areas. The Transit IVI involves
   automating transit vehicle control and safety systems. Each of these
   three components is discussed in detail as follows.

   Over the next five years, the Metropolitan component of Transit ITS
   will continue the evolution of initiatives which have proven
   successful. Activities in this area are divided into Traveler
   Information, Transit Management, and Electronic Fare Payment systems.
   The Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) effort is also to encourage
   the local transpiration managers to establish, adopt, and integrate the
   above key components of the ITS systems.

   Traveler Information efforts will focus on the integration of traveler
   information systems with fleet management systems and other
   operations-based systems. Anticipated technological advances will
   improve information kiosk capability and electronic bus stop signs. The
   integration of these systems will be able to provide improved levels of
   transit customer service information to the public Transit Management
   systems development will seek to improve integration with subsystems as
   well as with multiple operator systems and between transit and other
   modes. Such systems will streamline passenger counting, assist with the
   flexible routing of vehicles, enable timed-transfer for passengers,
   facilitate multiple-agency regional fleet management, and enhance
   automated vehicle diagnostics.

   Activities in Electronic Payment will continue to work towards the
   vision of a single cashless payment system that may be used for any
   mode of transportation, as well as for other applications including
   payment for telephone calls and retail purchasing. Integration with
   government benefits-transfer systems is also a feasible objective.
   Major activities include working with the industry to develop
   integration guidelines and system specifications, as well as highly
   focused operational tests aimed at solving specific integration issues.

   The Rural component of Transit ITS will focus on those unique
   characteristics of rural transit operations critical to rural
   communities. These activities will improve rural mobility by dispatch
   coordination with multiple transportation agencies, fleet maintenance
   coordination within a fleet and among fleets of different providers,
   communications including emergency service fleets, geocoding and
   addressing, coordination of responses to weather-related activities
   among various fleets (transit, highway maintenance, and emergency
   services), the development of regional traveler information
   architecture, and outreach to rural public transportation communities.

   A key factor tying the elements of the Metropolitan component of
   Transit ITS together and also enabling Transit ITS to integrate with
   other transportation modes is the National Architecture for ITS. The
   National Architecture provides the framework for integration. The
   National Architecture identifies four categories of senders and
   receivers of information (in rectangular boxes) and four categories of
   communications channels (in oval boxes). The National Architecture
   itself identifies the communications relationships between ITS entities
   in complete detail. While the Architecture does not identify the
   standards or protocols through which messages are sent, it does
   identify who must communicate with whom in ITS. As a partner in the
   development of the National Architecture, FTA's Transit ITS activities
   strongly encourages, and fully supports, consistency with the National
   Architecture in all ITS deployments.

   Standards help industry share technologies, improve reliability, reduce
   the costs of maintaining a qualified and knowledgeable workforce, and
   may reduce long-term costs. The first round of the Transit
   Communications Interface Profiles (TCIP) standards development is now
   complete and as the TCIP is implemented it will be monitored, reviewed
   and revised if necessary. FTA clearly recognizes that standards are
   important and that they should come from industry. FTA will act as a
   catalyst and participate in standards development to support the ITS
   National Architecture. This includes the development of consistency
   guidance for the National Architecture, as well as the refinement of
   the TCIP, and other ITS-related efforts. In the long term, FTA and the
   American Public Transit Association (APTA) will be launching the
   Transit Standards Consortium to serve as a forum for discussing
   standards issues and prioritizing standards needs. FTA will also assist
   in the development of international standards, to seek new markets
   abroad under the same international standards, and enhance U.S. global
   competitiveness in the long run.

   Mainstreaming ITS technologies and providing technical assistance on
   the National Architecture and how advanced technologies can be used to
   re-invent transit, also plays a critical role in the departmental
   Transit ITS program over the next five years. As knowledge from the
   research areas becomes available, and experience grows, it will be
   important to disseminate the information as quickly as possible in this
   rapidly changing area. Professional Capacity Building (PCB) through
   Training courses and workshops, peer-to-peer scanning tours, sharing of
   professionals through peer-to-peer networks, and development of
   standards and best practice guidance will be used to provide support to
   the transit industry in implementing ITS systems.
