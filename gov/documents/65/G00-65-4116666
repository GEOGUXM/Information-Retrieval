   What is Stroke?
   A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the part of the brain is
   suddenly interrupted (ischemic) or when a blood vessel in the brain
   bursts, spilling blood into the spaces surrounding the brain cells
   (hemorrhagic). The symptoms of stroke are easy to spot: sudden numbness
   or weakness, especially on one side of the body; sudden confusion or
   trouble speaking or understanding speech; sudden trouble seeing in one
   or both eyes; sudden trouble walking; dizziness; or loss of balance or
   coordination. Brain cells die when they no longer receive oxygen and
   nutrients from the blood or when they are damaged by sudden bleeding
   into or around the brain. These damaged cells can linger in a
   compromised state for several hours. With timely treatment, these cells
   can be saved. Stroke is diagnosed through several techniques: a short
   neurological examination, blood tests, CT scans, MRI scans, Doppler
   ultrasound, and arteriography. Stroke seems to run in some families.
   Family members may have a genetic tendency for stroke or share a
   lifestyle that contributes to stroke. The most important risk factors
   for stroke are hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and cigarette
   smoking. Other risks include heavy alcohol consumption, high blood
   cholesterol levels, illicit drug use, and genetic or congenital
   conditions. Some risk factors for stroke apply only to women. Primary
   among these are pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause.

   Is there any treatment?
   Generally, there are three treatment stages for stroke: prevention,
   therapy immediately after stroke, and post-stroke rehabilitation.
   Therapies to prevent stroke are based on treating an individual's
   underlying risk factors. Acute stroke therapies try to stop a stroke
   while it is happening. Post-stroke rehabilitation is to overcome
   disabilities that result from stroke damage. Medication or drug therapy
   is the most common treatment for stroke. Surgery can be used to prevent
   stroke, to treat acute stroke, or to repair vascular damage or
   malformations in and around the brain. For most stroke patients,
   physical therapy is the cornerstone of the rehabilitation process.
   Another type of therapy involving relearning daily activities is
   occupational therapy (OT). OT also involves exercise and training to
   help the stroke patient relearn everyday activities such as eating,
   drinking and swallowing, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and
   writing, and toileting. Speech therapy is appropriate for patients who
   have no deficits in cognition or thinking, but have problems
   understanding speech or written words, or problems forming speech.

   What is the prognosis?
   Although stroke is a disease of the brain, it can affect the entire
   body. Some of the disabilities that can result from stroke include
   paralysis, cognitive deficits, speech problems, emotional difficulties,
   daily living problems, and pain.

   What research is being done?
   Some brain damage that results from stroke may be secondary to the
   initial death of brain cells caused by the lack of blood flow to the
   brain tissue. This brain damage is a result of a toxic reaction to the
   primary damage. Researchers are studying the mechanisms of this toxic
   reaction and ways to prevent this secondary injury to the brain.
   Scientists hope to develop neuroprotective agents to prevent this
   damage. Another area of research involves experiments with
   vasodilators, medication that expand or dilate blood vessels and thus
   increase the blood flow to the brain. Basic research has also focused
   on the genetics of stroke and stroke risk factors. One area of research
   involving genetics is gene therapy. One promising area of stroke animal
   research involves hibernation. The dramatic decrease of blood flow to
   the brain in hibernating animals is extensive enough t that it would
   kill a non-hibernating animal. If scientists can discover how animals
   hibernate without experiences brain damage, then maybe they can
   discover ways to stop the brain damage associated with decreased blood
   flow in stroke patients. Other studies are looking at the role of
   hypothermia, or decreased body temperature, on metabolism and
   neuroprotection. Scientists are working to develop new and better ways
   to help the brain repair itself and restore important functions to the
   stroke patients. Some evidence suggests that transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS), in which a small magnetic current is delivered to an
   area of the brain, may possibly increase brain plasticity and speed up
   recover of function after stroke.
