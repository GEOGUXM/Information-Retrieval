   Summary File 2 (SF 2) contains 47 detailed tables focusing on age, sex,
   households, families, and occupied housing units for the total
   population. These tables are repeated for 249 detailed population
   groups based on the following criteria:
     * no tables are available for geographic areas having a population of
       less than 100
     * tables are repeated only for the race groups, American Indian and
       Alaska Native tribes, and Hispanic or Latino groups having a
       population of 100 or more within the geographic area.

   For a complete list of the 249 population groups, see Appendix H of the
   SF 2 Technical Documentation (PDF).
