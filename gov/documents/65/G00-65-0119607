      COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR THE ISS
      (November 16, 1998):

      NASA is implementing the Commercial Space Act of 1998 by developing
      policies and processes to stimulate industry investment in ISS economic
      development. The ISS Commercial Development Plan establishes a strategy
      of pathfinder business opportunities in which NASA partners with the
      private sector. These business pathfinders will break down public
      sector and market barriers, enabling industry to achieve profitable
      operations in the long run, without public subsidies.

   SPACE STATION COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
   DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM

   In October, 1999, Congress passed legislation, signed by the President,
   to "establish a demonstration regarding the commercial feasibility and
   economic viability of private sector business operations involving the
   International Space Station and its related infrastructure." This
   legislation is an essential component of NASA's effort to stimulate and
   support economic development in low Earth orbit.

   The committee report directs NASA to establish and publish a pricing
   policy designed to eliminate price uncertainty for commercial use of
   the ISS. The primary innovation in the legislation concerns the use of
   receipts for commercial use. The legislation stipulates that any
   receipts collected by NASA from the commercial use of the ISS will
   first be used to offset any costs incurred by NASA in support of that
   commercial use. Any receipts collected in excess of those costs may
   then be retained by NASA for reinvestment in the ISS economic
   development program.
