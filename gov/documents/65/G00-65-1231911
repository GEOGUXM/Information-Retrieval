   The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552, requires
   federal agencies to disclose records after receiving a written request
   for them, except for records protected from disclosure by certain
   provisions of the FOIA. This site is designed to familiarize you with
   the specific procedures for making a FOIA request to the National Labor
   Relations Board. The site also includes descriptions of the types of
   records maintained by the NLRB, and directly links to a number of
   records available over the internet.
