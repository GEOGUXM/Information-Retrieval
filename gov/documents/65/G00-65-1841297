     General Information
     The Community Connections Program, a program of the Bureau of
     Educational and Cultural Affairs, offers home stay-based,
     three-to-five week practical training opportunities in the U.S. for
     entrepreneurs, local government officials, legal professionals,
     non-governmental organization leaders and other professionals from
     Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and
     Kazakhstan.

     Local community host organizations arrange internships for
     participants based on interests and experience. Companies offering
     internships range from small, family-run enterprises to major,
     multi-national "Fortune 500" corporations.

     The goals of the Community Connections program are to:
     * provide participants with professional training and exposure to
       day-to-day functioning of a free market system;
     * encourage public-private partnerships in the NIS by including
       private sector and government participants;
     * create links between U.S. and NIS regions and communities.

     Programs for English-speaking business participants must be designed
     as individual internship experiences. They may include seminars,
     consultancies and site visits.

     Programs for professionals who do not speak English are less
     individualized, more group focused, and use a variety of training
     methodologies. All professional programs are implemented with the
     assistance of U.S.-based locally hired interpreters.

     Funding for Community Connections is provided by the FREEDOM Support
     Act. Grants are awarded to community-based, non-profit 501(c)(3)
     organizations and cover expenses such as participant airfare, modest
     per diem for participants during their U.S. stay, administrative
     expenses necessary for program operations, and local transportation
     during the program. Almost all of the funds awarded to local
     community organizations are spent in the local community.

     Recruitment is carried out in the NIS countries by American
     organizations with representation in those countries. Recruitment is
     a merit-based open competition, and participants must successfully
     complete a three stage selection process: completion of an
     application, a review of the application by a committee of experts
     in the particular field of interest (business, NGO, legal), and an
     in-person interview conducted by members of the professional
     community.

     Selected participants are then placed with community organizations
     in the U.S. that will prepare the program for the participants,
     including arranging a hands-on internship with volunteer companies
     and organizations of similar interest and housing with American
     families that volunteer to open their homes to the participants.
