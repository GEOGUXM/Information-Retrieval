     Colorectal cancer exacts a substantial toll on our society, in terms
     of both health care costs and human suffering. Yet the means to
     reduce this burden are within our reach today: It is estimated that
     current screening recommendations, properly employed, could enable
     us to avoid 50 percent of colorectal cancer deaths per year.
     Bridging the gap between those who do and do not get screened is an
     important goal. Development of new screening technologies and
     raising the awareness of the public and of health care professionals
     concerning the importance of colorectal cancer prevention,
     screening, and early detection are of major significance....

     The members of the Colorectal Cancer PRG believe that, by applying
     and expanding our foundation of knowledge, and by teamwork, new
     technology, and perseverance, major progress will be made in the
     coming decade. At this gateway to the next era in colorectal cancer
     research, the Colorectal Cancer PRG has identified critical areas
     that span the continuum of colorectal cancer research and care.
