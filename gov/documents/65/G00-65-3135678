   A Word From the Commissioner



   Welcome to the California Highway Patrol (CHP), one of the preeminent
   law enforcement organizations in the world. The CHP is also one of the
   world's most recognized law enforcement agencies because of the
   television media, which has produced popular TV programs featuring the
   Highway Patrol, the California mystique and its mobile life style.
   However glamorous this may be, it is largely a fictitious Hollywood
   version of the actual CHP. Since its inception, the Highway Patrol has
   enjoyed a solid reputation with the driving public and allied agencies
   which is based on the high caliber of its officers and staff, and its
   outstanding law enforcement policies and procedures.
