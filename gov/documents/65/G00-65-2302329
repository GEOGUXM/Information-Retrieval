Overview

   The Center air traffic controllers and Traffic Management Coordinators
   (TMCs) control arriving aircraft that enter the Center from an adjacent
   Center or depart from feeder airports within the Center. On the basis
   of the current and future traffic flow, the TMC creates a plan to
   deliver the aircraft, safely separated, to the TRACON at a rate that
   fully subscribes, but does not exceed, the capacity of the TRACON and
   destination airports. The TMC's plan consists of sequences and
   scheduled times of arrival (STAs) at the meter fix, published points
   that lie on the Center-TRACON boundary. The Center air traffic
   controllers issue clearances to the aircraft in Center so that they
   cross the meter fixes at the STAs specified in the TMC's plan. Near the
   TRACON, the Center controllers hand the aircraft off to the TRACON air
   traffic controllers.

                                  Figure 1

   The Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) assists, but does not replace, the
   Center TMCs and air traffic controllers in several ways. TMA increases
   situational awareness through its graphical displays and alerts. TMA
   also generates statistics and reports about the traffic flow. In
   addition, TMA computes the undelayed estimated time of arrival (ETA) to
   the outer meter arc, meter fix, final approach fix and runway threshold
   for each aircraft. Furthermore, TMA computes the sequences and
   scheduled times of arrival (STAs) to the outer meter arc, meter fix,
   final approach fix, and runway threshold for each aircraft to meet the
   sequencing and scheduling constraints entered by the TMC. The TMA also
   assigns each aircraft to a runway to optimize the STAs. Although the
   TMA computes the STAs and runway assignments for each aircraft in
   Center, FAST may overrule these STAs and runway assignments when the
   aircraft enters the TRACON airspace. TMA continually updates its
   results at a speed comparable to the live radar update rate in response
   to changing events and controller inputs.

   The TMA software suite consists of the following CTAS processes.
   Communications Manager (CM)

     The CM provides the communication and common database between each
     of the processes.

   Radar Daemon

     The Radar Daemon serves as the interface between CTAS and the air
     traffic control facility's host computer.

   Weather Daemon

     The Weather Daemon receives and processes live weather information
     from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or
     the National Weather Service (NWS).

   Timeline Graphical User Interface (TGUI)

     The TGUI receives input from and displays information to the TMCs.

   Planview Graphical User Interface (PGUI)

     The PGUI receives input from and displays information to the
     controllers and TMCs.

   Route Analyzer (RA)

     The RA computes the projected horizontal route that each aircraft
     will follow. This information is then passed to the Trajectory
     Synthesizer (TS).

   Trajectory Synthesizer (TS)

     The TS computes the ETAs and 4-D trajectory, including both the
     horizontal route and descent profile, for each aircraft.

   Dynamic Planner (DP)

     The DP computes the runway assignment for each aircraft and computes
     the sequences and STAs to the outer meter arcs, meter fixes, final
     approach fixes, and runway thresholds.

Planning

   An important feature of TMA is its ability to sequence and schedule
   aircraft to the outer fix, meter fix, final approach fix, and runway
   threshold in such a way as to maximize airport and TRACON capacity
   without compromising safety. In addition, TMA will assign the aircraft
   to runways to optimize the schedule. All of this activity takes place
   while the aircraft is in the Center's airspace (approximately 40 to 200
   miles from the arrival airport). Moreover, scheduling of some aircraft
   takes place before the aircraft have even entered the Center's airspace
   as long as that aircraft's flight plan is received by CTAS. TMA will
   schedule aircraft based on the aircraft's flight plan information that
   may be received as much as 90 minutes before the aircraft enters the
   Center's airspace. TMA will update these sequences, schedules, and
   runway assignments constantly to adapt to changes in the traffic
   situation, changes in the environment, or in response to inputs by the
   TMCs. This process of sequencing, scheduling, and assigning runways is
   described below.

  Scheduling Events

   TMA will reschedule all or some of the aircraft in response to various
   events. Some of these events will trigger a reschedule immediately.
   These immediate scheduling events are as follows.
     * Addition/deletion of a gate blocked interval
     * Addition/deletion of a meter fix blocked interval
     * Airport acceptance rate change
     * Change in the occupancy time or required separation distance at a
       runway
     * Gate acceptance rate change
     * Meter fix acceptance rate change
     * Super stream class redefinition or separation distance change
     * TRACON acceptance rate change
     * Addition of a meter fix sequence constraint
     * A Find Slot operation initiated by the TMC
     * A meter fix STA manually set for an aircraft by the TMC
     * A runway STA manually set for an aircraft by the TMC
     * A request by the TMC to reschedule one or more aircraft
     * Time passage of at least 6 seconds since the last schedule

   In addition, other events are placed in a pending list for rescheduling
   later. Events in the pending list trigger a reschedule when an
   immediate rescheduling event is received. Pending rescheduling events
   also trigger a reschedule when a pending event of a different type is
   received. The pending list is processed and subsequently flushed.
   Pending rescheduling events are as follows.
     * Flight plan amendment that changes an aircraft's runway
     * Flight plan amendment that changes an aircraft's coordination fix
     * Aircraft's ETA is ``hovered'' (see description below)

     CTAS receives the flight plans for aircraft before they become
     active, and an aircraft becomes active when its radar track is
     received. An active or inactive aircraft's Scheduled Time of Arrival
     (STA) is constantly updated until the aircraft's meter fix ETA is
     less than or equal to 19 minutes in the future. At that point, the
     aircraft's STA is frozen. This point 19 minutes in the future is
     known as the freeze horizon.

     Example: Suppose it is 12:00 noon. The freeze horizon is located 19
     minutes in the future at 12:19pm. Delta flight #678 has a meter fix
     ETA of 12:18pm which is less than 19 minutes in the future.
     Therefore, its STA is frozen. However, United flight #525 has a
     meter fix ETA of 12:20pm. This is more than 19 minutes in the
     future, so its STA is not frozen.
     One minute later, at 12:01pm, United flight #525 has its STA frozen
     because its meter fix ETA of 12:20pm is now 19 minutes in the
     future.

     If the aircraft was supposed to become active before it reaches the
     freeze horizon, but it is still inactive, then the aircraft's meter
     fix ETA is increased by a few minutes to keep it outside of the
     freeze horizon. When the aircraft's meter fix ETA is modified in
     this manner, the aircraft is said have had its ETA ``hovered.'' When
     the aircraft finally becomes active, its STA will be frozen when its
     meter fix ETA becomes less than or equal to 19 minutes in the
     future.

  Sequencing

   An important part of the scheduling process is the construction of the
   sequence of aircraft. Aircraft are sequenced in first-come first-served
   (FCFS) order within each super stream class according to their meter
   fix ETA. A super stream class is a group of aircraft that share similar
   scheduling characteristics. Super stream classes are typically based on
   engine type (jet or prop), destination airport, and meter fix.

   In addition, sequence constraints entered by the controllers and TMCs
   will override the FCFS order. Each sequence constraint involves two
   aircraft in the same super stream class, and each sequence constraint
   can be one of two types. The first type of sequence constraint is a
   direct sequence constraint. Such a constraint restricts one aircraft
   directly behind another aircraft in the sequence. The second type of
   sequence constraint is an indirect sequence constraint. This is a
   weaker constraint than a direct sequence constraint, and it restricts
   one aircraft anywhere behind another aircraft in the sequence. Other
   aircraft may be sequenced between these two aircraft without violating
   the indirect sequence constraint.

   TMA also contains code to resolve sequence constraint conflicts. If
   sequence constraints are found to conflict with one another, then the
   sequence constraint with the lower priority at the time of the
   scheduling is ignored. If the sequence constraints are of equal
   priority, then the older sequence constraint is ignored. Note that
   conditions may change from scheduling cycle to scheduling cycle and may
   affect which sequence constraints are in conflict with each other.
   Thus, a sequence constraint might be obeyed during one scheduling
   cycle, but may be ignored during a later scheduling cycle due to
   changes in the situation.

  Scheduling

   Once a sequence to the meter fix has been determined, the scheduled
   time of arrival (STA) at the meter fix is computed for each aircraft.
   No aircraft is assigned an STA that is earlier than its nominal ETA to
   the meter fix. Moreover, the aircraft may be assigned an STA that is
   later than its ETA due to the scheduling constraints and its position
   in the sequence. The difference between the STA and the ETA is known as
   the aircraft's delay. The aircraft have their preliminary meter fix
   STAs computed in the order that they appear in the meter fix sequence
   computed above. For each aircraft, the aircraft's meter fix STA is set
   equal to the aircraft's nominal meter fix ETA. The aircraft's STA is
   then increased (thus delaying the aircraft) so that the aircraft's STA
   complies with all of the following scheduling constraints set by the
   TMC.
   TRACON Acceptance Rate

     The maximum number of aircraft per hour that can be scheduled to
     enter the TRACON.

   Meter Fix Acceptance Rate

     The maximum number of aircraft per hour that can be scheduled to
     cross a meter fix. Each meter fix has its own meter fix acceptance
     rate.

   Gate Acceptance Rate

     The maximum number of aircraft per hour that can be scheduled to
     cross any of the meter fixes contained within a gate. Each gate has
     its own gate acceptance rate.

   Super Stream Class Miles In Trail Separation

     Separation, in nautical miles, between aircraft as they cross the
     meter fix. Each super stream class has its own miles in trail
     restriction.

   Meter Fix Blocked Intervals

     Time intervals during which aircraft may not be scheduled to cross
     the meter fix.

   Note that an aircraft's meter fix STA will be computed to comply with
   all of the scheduling constraints. This effectively means that the most
   stringent constraint will have the greatest effect on an aircraft's
   STA. However, which constraint is the most stringent one will vary from
   aircraft to aircraft.

   Next, aircraft have their runway STAs computed according to an ``order
   of consideration.'' This order of consideration is based on the order
   of preliminary meter fix STAs and the runway ETAs. The aircraft with
   the earliest meter fix STA within each super stream class is examined.
   From this set of aircraft, the aircraft with the earliest runway ETA is
   considered for scheduling to the runway. A rigid sequence at the runway
   is not possible because, under certain conditions, the runway sequence
   may conflict with the meter fix sequence. The order of consideration
   maintains the sequence at the meter fixes and gives preference to
   aircraft with earlier runway ETAs when computing the runway STAs.

   For each aircraft in the order of consideration, the STA is computed to
   the runway such that the STA is no earlier than the sum of the meter
   fix STA plus the TRACON transition time. The TRACON transition time is
   the nominal time to fly from the meter fix to the runway if there were
   no other aircraft in the airspace. This is computed according to:
    TRACON Transition Time = (Runway ETA) - (Meter Fix ETA)

   The aircraft's STA is increased, thus adding delay, as necessary to
   comply with the following scheduling constraints. Airport Acceptance
   Rate

     The maximum number of aircraft per hour that can be scheduled to
     land at a particular airport.

   Runway Acceptance Rate

     The maximum number of aircraft per hour that can be scheduled to
     land on a particular runway.

   Wake Vortex Separation

     Separation, in nautical miles, between aircraft as they land. The
     amount of separation varies depending on the engine type and weight
     class of the two aircraft to be separated from each other.

   Runway Occupancy Time

     Additional time between arriving aircraft to account for various
     stopping conditions and the amount of time required by a landed
     aircraft to clear the runway.

   Runway Blocked Intervals

     Time intervals during which aircraft may not be scheduled to land.

   These runway scheduling constraints are applied either at the runway
   threshold or at the final approach fix (FAF) depending on the airport
   configuration. For configurations associated with Instrument Flight
   Rule (IFR) conditions, the scheduling constraints are applied at the
   runway threshold. For configurations associated with Visual Flight Rule
   (VFR) conditions, the scheduling constraints are applied at the final
   approach fix. The other runway STA is computed by adding or subtracting
   (as appropriate) the nominal flight time between the two points. For
   example, under IFR, the STA at the runway threshold is computed to
   comply with the scheduling constraints. The STA at the final approach
   fix is then set to the runway threshold STA minus the nominal time to
   fly from the final approach fix to the runway threshold.

   Heavy traffic conditions and bad weather can contribute to delays
   within the TRACON. The TRACON can absorb only so much of this delay.
   Therefore, some of this delay must be fed back into the Center
   airspace. An aircraft's delay at the runway is computed according to:
    delay = (Runway STA) - [(Meter Fix STA) + (TRACON Transition Time)]

   If this delay exceeds an amount preset for a particular TRACON, then
   the excess delay is added to the aircraft's meter fix STA. This will
   most likely delay other aircraft in the Center that are sequenced
   behind this aircraft. Their meter fix STAs will be increased as
   appropriate to meet all of the scheduling constraints while maintaining
   their position in the sequence.

   Finally, once the final meter fix, runway threshold, and final approach
   fix STAs have been computed for all aircraft, the Outer Meter Arc (OMA)
   STAs are computed. There are no scheduling constraints at the OMA.
   Therefore, the OMA STA for each aircraft is computed according to:
    OMA STA = (Meter Fix STA) - [(Meter Fix ETA) - (OMA ETA)] - AMDT,

   where AMDT is the amount of delay to be absorbed in the low altitude
   approach sector.

  Runway Allocation Events

   TMA will assign aircraft to runways which reduce the delay of all
   aircraft in the system in a process known as Runway Allocation. From
   the TMC's point of view, it is undesirable to have an aircraft switch
   runways constantly even if this would continually optimize the
   schedule. Therefore, only certain events trigger the runway allocation
   process. Some of these events will cause an immediate runway
   allocation. These immediate allocation events are as follows.
     * Addition/deletion of a runway blocked interval
     * Change in the acceptance rate of one or more runways
     * Departure of an aircraft from an airport in Center
     * Aircraft is about to have its STA frozen
     * Change in an aircraft's priority status
     * Aircraft has been reset
     * Resumption of an aircraft that has been suspended from scheduling
     * A flight plan is received which changes an aircraft's gate
     * A flight plan is received which changes an aircraft's meter fix
     * A flight plan is received which changes an aircraft's destination
       airport
     * Receipt of the initial set of flight plans when TMA is first
       brought up
     * Manual request by the TMC to reallocate one, some, or all aircraft

   In addition, other events are placed in a pending list for later runway
   allocation. Events in the pending list trigger a runway allocation when
   an immediate runway allocation event is received. Pending runway
   allocation events also trigger a runway allocation when a pending event
   of a different type is received. The pending list is processed and
   subsequently flushed. Pending runway allocation events are as follows.
     * Change in the airport configuration of an aircraft
     * Receipt of the first ETA for a new flight plan or newly active
       aircraft

  Runway Allocation

   The schedules computed by TMA can be optimized by allocating runways to
   aircraft to reduce delay. Although FAST will overrule any runway
   assignments made by TMA, TMA's runway assignments and schedules ensure
   that the Center schedules apply the right amount of pressure on the
   TRACON so that the TRACON's scheduling constraints are met but not
   exceeded.

   The following describes TMA's allocation process in response to a given
   event. The event may either be a current event that requires immediate
   allocation, or an event that was taken from the pending list. (See
   Runway Allocation Events.)
   Determine which aircraft require allocation.

     Which aircraft are involved depends on the time of the allocation
     event, the type of event, and which runways have an increasing,
     decreasing, or steady acceptance rate as a result of the event.

     If the event changes the acceptance rate of one or more runways,
     then the algorithm will allocate aircraft which were previously
     assigned to runways which now have a decreasing acceptance rate. The
     goal is to reduce overall delay by moving aircraft off of a runway
     with a reduced capacity. In addition, the algorithm will try to
     allocate aircraft from their previously assigned runways to runways
     whose acceptance rates are increasing. The goal in this case is to
     take advantage of a runway's increased capacity to reduce overall
     delay.

   CAPTION: Runway Allocation Example

   Runway Acceptance Rate Before Event
   (aircraft/hour) Acceptance Rate After Event Acceptance Rate Change
   Considered for Allocation
   A 54 aircraft/hour 36 aircraft/hour Decreasing Yes
   B 27 aircraft/hour 36 aircraft/hour Increasing No
   C 40 aircraft/hour 40 aircraft/hour Steady Yes

     The table above shows an example where various runway acceptance
     rates are changed as part of an allocation event. As a result of the
     allocation event, Runway A has a decreasing acceptance rate, Runway
     B has an increasing acceptance rate, and Runway C has an unchanged
     acceptance rate. Aircraft assigned to Runway A are considered for
     allocation since Runway A has a decreasing acceptance rate. At the
     same time, aircraft assigned to Runway C are considered for
     allocation because Runway B has an increasing acceptance rate.
     However, aircraft on Runway B are not considered for allocation at
     all since no other runway has an increasing acceptance rate.

     The addition or deletion of of a runway blocked interval will
     trigger a runway allocation. The algorithm treats adding a blocked
     interval to a runway the same as decreasing the acceptance rate of
     that runway. Similarly, the deletion of a runway blocked interval is
     treated the same as increasing the acceptance rate of that runway.

     Finally, there are some events which trigger runway allocation for a
     single aircraft. For instance, when an aircraft is new to the system
     and it's runway ETAs have just been computed, then an allocation
     event is triggered for this aircraft. In this case, all available
     runways are considered during the runway allocation of a single
     aircraft.

   Determine Allocation Mode.

     The Allocation Mode is dependent on the event type. The mode directs
     the allocation algorithm to follow specific rules when allocating
     aircraft to runways.

   For each aircraft, follow the site-specific allocation rules.

     The first step is to determine the runway allocation category for
     the current aircraft. The runway allocation category depends on the
     aircraft's destination airport and the airport's configuration since
     these two pieces of data indicate which runways are available. The
     runway allocation category also depends on the aircraft's assigned
     meter fix because some runways are favored more when the aircraft
     crosses over one meter fix than when it crosses over another.
     Finally, the runway allocation category depends on the aircraft's
     engine type (jet, turbo-prop, or piston) and the runway allocation
     mode determined in the previous step.

     Once the runway allocation category has been determined, the
     site-specific runway allocation rules corresponding to that category
     are followed. These rules give the order in which each runway is
     examined for the current aircraft. The aircraft is temporarily
     assigned to the runway which the rules say should be examined next.
     Subsequently, that aircraft and all aircraft following it are
     rescheduled (see Scheduling). The STAs of all of these aircraft are
     added together to arrive at the System Schedule Time. The allocation
     rules specify how much this System Schedule Time must be better than
     the System Schedule Time for the best runway trial-assignment seen
     so far. If this runway assignment is sufficiently better than the
     best seen so far, then this runway assignment becomes the best
     assignment seen so far. Note that the amount by which the current
     trial-runway assignment must be better allows the runway allocation
     algorithm to favor some runways over others within a runway
     allocation category. For instance, if it is determined that Runway X
     should be favored over Runway Y, then the rules for the current
     allocation category may specify that Runway Y may only be selected
     over Runway X if the savings in System Schedule Time is over M
     minutes.

                     Runway Allocation Considerations D
                                  Figure 2

     The rules also specify which runways to consider for allocation.
     This is particularly important in cases where the acceptance rates
     of one or more runways have changed as a result of an allocation
     event. Referring to Figure 2, the aircraft on Runway A will consider
     both Runway B and Runway C for allocation because Runway A has a
     decreasing acceptance rate. Also, the aircraft on Runway C will
     consider Runway B because the acceptance rate of Runway B is
     increasing.

     The rules work in a similar manner for runway blocked intervals. In
     this case, adding a runway blocked interval results in the same
     allocation rules as when the acceptance rate of that runway is
     decreasing. Also, removing a blocked interval has the same set of
     rules as when the acceptance rate of that runway is increased.

   Compute a schedule using the newly assigned runways.

     A schedule is computed for the aircraft affected by the allocation
     event (see Scheduling). During this scheduling process, the newly
     assigned runways are used.

   A Schedule message is sent out containing the STAs just computed.
   Each aircraft's airport configuration is updated.

     As a result of the allocation and reschedule, the aircraft may end
     up on the other side of a configuration change event.

   Flight plan amendments are sent to the other CTAS processes.

     As a result of allocation and scheduling, the aircraft's airport
     configuration and assigned runway may have changed. For those
     aircraft that have changed, a flight plan is assembled and sent to
     the other CTAS processes informing them of the change in
     configuration, runway assignment, or both.

Graphical User Interfaces

   What follows is only a brief summary of TMA's graphical user interface.
   More detailed information may be found in the TMA Procedures Summaries.

   TMA provides a number graphical features that improve situational
   awareness while accepting inputs from the controllers and TMCs. The
   graphical features that improve situational awareness include
   timelines, load graphs, planview displays, sequence lists, traffic
   count overlays, aircraft watch windows, rush alerts, data degradation
   alerts, and other text overlays. The TMCs and controllers can interact
   with TMA through control panels, buttons, sliders, pop-up menus as well
   as clicking and dragging various graphical entities on the displays.
   These graphical features are displayed by the TGUI, PGUI, and, to a
   limited extent, the CM.

  Timelines

   The timeline, a basic feature of TMA, improves situational awareness
   and accepts input from controllers and TMCs. Full featured timelines, a
   portion of one is shown in Figure 3, appear on the TGUI while partial
   featured timelines appear on the PGUI (see Figure 4). Each timeline
   displays its own time scale and reference point type. A reference point
   type can be a meter fix, final approach fix or runway threshold. An
   abbreviation below the timeline indicates the reference point type. For
   example, the reference point type for the timeline shown in Figure 3 is
   a meter fix as indicated by the green ``MF.'' The abbreviations below
   this timeline also indicate that only aircraft assigned to any runway
   and the meter fix ACTON (as indicated by ``AQ'') are displayed on this
   timeline. The TMC can configure the timeline to display whichever
   aircraft is desired. The bottom of the timeline represents the current
   time, and each tick mark represents a minute after the hour. Timelines
   also show the ETAs and STAs of arriving air traffic. The sample
   timeline shown in Figure 3 displays the ETAs along the left side and
   the STAs along the right side of the timeline.

   CAPTION:

   Each aircraft is represented by an aircraft tag that contains the
   airline company and the flight number. For example, the TMC can view
   the timeline in Figure 3 and see that American Airlines flight number
   652 (AAL652) has an ETA of almost 5 minutes after the hour and an STA
   of almost 7 minutes after the hour. The green ``2'' next to the STA
   indicates that TMA's scheduler has delayed this aircraft by 2 minutes
   (rounded to the nearest minute) to meet certain scheduling constraints
   entered by the TMC. The aircraft tags along the timelines convey
   additional information. The symbol next to the flight number indicates
   the wake vortex class of the aircraft. For example, DAL1991 is a heavy
   aircraft, NTS172 is a small aircraft, EGF586 is a large aircraft, and
   AAL652 is a Boeing 757 (a large aircraft creating a wake like a heavy).
   The symbol for DAL1991 is orange indicating that CTAS has not received
   any radar tracks for that aircraft, and TMA has computed the ETA and
   STA using the filed flight plan of the aircraft. The color of each
   aircraft tag is also significant. ETAs are displayed in green. Unfrozen
   STAs are displayed in yellow while frozen STAs are displayed in
   turquoise. A frozen STA means that the aircraft is close enough to the
   meter fix that TMA's scheduler will not change that aircraft's STA
   except in response to extraordinary events.

   The TMC can also input information to the TMA via the timeline. When
   the TMC clicks on an aircraft tag, a pop up menu (see Figure 5) allows
   the TMC to select from a set of operations on that particular aircraft
   or on that particular aircraft plus all aircraft following that
   aircraft. Aircraft sequences and schedules can also be manually changed
   by clicking and dragging the aircraft tag to the desired position in
   the sequence or location on the timeline. In addition, blocked
   intervals during which TMA's scheduler will not schedule any aircraft
   can be indicated by dragging a line on the timeline. Additionally, a
   TMC can create a blocked slot by clicking on a point on the timeline
   and selecting, from the pop-up menu (see Figure 6), the aircraft type
   (specified by wake vortex category and engine type) of the blocked
   slot.

  Overlays

   An overlay feature is available to allow the TMC access to detailed
   information about a particular aircraft. With this featured switched
   on, the TMC can point to an aircraft tag, and a display (see Figure 7)
   shows the aircraft's type, stream class, assigned meter fix and runway,
   and various ETA and STA information. In the example shown in Figure 7,
   DAL135 is a Boeing 767, its weight class is ``heavy'', it has been
   assigned to the meter fix BUJ and the runway 18R, and its stream class
   is DFW_BLUERIDGE_JETS. The various ETAs and STAs are also visible.

                         Figure 7 - Aircraft Overlay

   TMCs are often called upon to record the number aircraft that have
   landed or crossed a meter fix during various intervals in time. TMA
   assists with this process by displaying a Traffic Count Overlay.
   Displayed on this overlay are the number of ETAs and STAs to the runway
   threshold and the number of meter fix crossings during various time
   intervals in the past, present, and future. Figure 8 shows an example
   of this overlay where the current time is somewhere between 1700 and
   1709. The time intervals are each 10 minutes in size, and the numbers
   indicate the number of aircraft that have threshold ETAs, threshold
   STAs, and have crossed the meter fixes (Fdg is an abbreviation for
   Feeder Gate which is the same thing as a meter fix) in each 10 minute
   interval.

                      Figure 8 - Traffic Count Overlay

  Load Graphs

   Another TMA feature that improves situational awareness is the Load
   Graph. The Load Graph can be configured to show present and future
   traffic flow to various reference points. The example shown in Figure 9
   shows the traffic flow to the DFW airport. The vertical axis is the
   number of aircraft in a 10 minute period while the horizontal axis
   represents time in the future in a manner similar to the timelines. The
   numbers on the horizontal axis represent the number of minutes after
   the hour. The green line is based on ETA data, and it shows the
   expected traffic demand in 10 minute periods. In this example, the
   expected demand peaks at 33 aircraft in a 10 minute period (198
   aircraft per hour). The red line shows the airport acceptance rate that
   has been set in TMA by the TMC. In this example, the airport acceptance
   rate has been set at 18 aircraft per 10 minute period (108 aircraft per
   hour). The yellow line shows the planned arrivals to DFW as computed by
   TMA's scheduling algorithms based on the desired airport acceptance
   rate. In this example, we see that the scheduling algorithm has
   scheduled aircraft so as to come as close as possible to the airport
   acceptance rate without exceeding it. Far in the future, the demand
   decreases, and hence the number of planned arrivals does not fully
   subscribe the airport acceptance rate.

  Rush Alert

   Air traffic often arrives in bunches in a manner similar to rush hour
   traffic on the roadways in any major city. In air traffic control
   terms, this is called a ``Rush.'' TMA contains a graphical display
   known as a Rush Alert that informs a TMC that such a rush has been
   detected and when the rush will occur. The TMC can specify the interval
   size in minutes and the number of aircraft within that interval size
   which constitutes a rush. When the number of aircraft during any
   interval of the specified size equals or exceeds this threshold level,
   a pair of red brackets is displayed showing the earliest time when a
   rush has been detected (see Figure 10).

                           Figure 10 - Rush Alert

  Data Degradation Alert - ``Big Red X''

   The TMA's TGUI can also detect when the data it expects from other CTAS
   processes is missing or is incomplete. The TMC is alerted to this via a
   large red ``X'' across the TGUI display. A dialog box is displayed
   which indicates which pieces of data are missing. For example, in
   Figure 11, the TGUI has detected that no scheduled times (STAs) have
   been received for 3 minutes. It has also detected that ETA updates for
   less than 80% (61% in this case) of the aircraft have been received.

  Panels

   Figure 12 shows the panel used to enter an airport acceptance rate
   change. In this example, the user is about to set the airport
   acceptance rate for Dallas/Fort Worth to 108 aircraft per hour. The
   user has indicated that the time of the acceptance rate change is 0010
   Zulu. The airport acceptance rate panel is representative of the many
   panels that allow the TMC to alter CTAS parameters to meet current and
   future air traffic control needs.

   Figure 13 shows a portion of the PGUI. It shows the tracks, headings,
   speeds, altitudes, and IDs of arriving traffic. In this example, the
   traffic shown is arriving over the Bridgeport (BPR) meter fix at Fort
   Worth ARTCC.

  Sequence List

   The PGUI can also display timelines as shown in Figure 4. This same
   information can be displayed in text form in the sequence list (see
   Figure 14). This overlay example shows the aircraft's ID, weight class,
   CID, assigned meter fix, and its meter fix ETA and STA. Across the top
   of the overlay is displayed the time of day, airport configuration, and
   airport acceptance rate.

  Watch Window

   Figure 15 shows a watch window for a particular aircraft. A number of
   watch windows for individual aircraft may be brought up on the CM.
   Since CM serves as a central database for TMA, most of the information
   about an aircraft may be viewed via CM's watch window. The watch window
   shows the aircraft identification, type, and flight plan. It also shows
   the current track information such as the flight level (FL), true
   airspeed (TAS), heading, and area (Center or TRACON). The aircraft's
   assigned gate, meter fix, runway and sectors are also shown. Near the
   bottom are the various ETAs that CTAS has computed to various reference
   points.

  TMA Operational Evaluations at ZFW & DFW

    June 17-21, 1996

   A full operational evaluation of the CTAS tool known as the Traffic
   Management Advisor (TMA) was conducted for eleven rushes during the
   week of June 17 - 21, 1996. In all evaluated rushes the TMA reduced
   advisory delays from ZFW into DFW by at least 1 -2 minutes when
   compared to ASP. The TMA advisory delays in three of the rushes
   evaluated were on the order of 4 to 5 minutes less than ASP. Feedback
   from the sector controllers indicates that not only were the advisory
   delays reduced but also control delays reduced. This control delay
   reduction is attributed to the decreased metering sector controller
   workload when using the TMA generated crossing time and countdown delay
   advisories. The overall feedback from this first week of evaluations is
   that the TMA reduces advisory delays, control delays and has proved
   that the delay benefits predicted by Dr. Heinz Erzberger are highly
   conservative estimates. Feedback from the Traffic Management
   Coordinators, sector controllers and ZFW and DFW Traffic Management
   Officers is that the TMA system is significantly better than the
   existing ASP tool and should be used regularly.

   A brief synopsis of each TMA scheduled (metered) rush is as follows:

   Monday, June 17, 1996, 8:30 p.m. rush
          DFW was recovering from an airport shutdown due to thunderstorms
          during the 6:30 PM rush. The thunderstorms were also in the area
          and closed down the BUJ arrival gate. BUJ later reopened and the
          SCY gate closed. The TMA was used to schedule and provide
          controller advisories to meet a 96 airport rate requiring
          approximately 12 minutes of delay. The rate was low because the
          airport was experiencing approximately 1 hour ground delays.
          During the post evaluation debrief the TMC lead congratulated
          the TMA evaluation team stating that the ASP system is not
          usable with a gate closed due to weather. Without TMA the TMU
          would have resorted to an antiquated miles-in-trail plan to meet
          the TRACON restrictions.

   Tuesday, June 18, 1996, 6:30 p.m. rush
          The 6:30 p.m. rush was a more nominal situation, the rate was
          102 and ASP was advising 8 minutes maximum delay and the TMA a
          maximum of 6 minutes. The TMA advised free-flow for the 8:30 PM
          rush while ASP was advising 2-3 minutes of delay. The TMC lead
          decided on TMA free-flow.

   Wednesday, June 19, 1996, 9:00 a.m. rush
          During the 9:00 a.m. rush, an extremely heavy east side rush was
          evaluated. The TMA was advising 3-5 minutes of delay and ASP 5 -
          7 minutes. The sector controllers did not follow their sector
          advisory lists very closely (the controllers were sending
          aircraft in 2 - 3 minutes early). The impact on the TRACON was
          that they came very close to shutting off the Center over BUJ.
          The positive feedback from the evaluation was that the TMCs had
          the information real-time due to the fact that the delay
          advisories will count up as well as count down. The ZFW TMC
          evaluation team and CTAS NATCA representative plan to resolve
          this issue through further education regarding the accuracy of
          TMA advisories and how overall delays and workload are reduced
          if the advisories are followed.

   Wednesday, June 19, 1996, 11:30 a.m. rush
          During the 11:30 rush (noon balloon), TMA required maximum
          delays of 8-9 minutes and ASP (prior to its termination) 10 - 11
          minutes. The TMC in-charge of the metering position commented
          that without the TMA the Center would be in a NAPRS delay
          reporting situation.

   Thursday, June 20, 1996
          The TMA was used operationally from 6:30 a.m. until 3:00 p.m.
          for all rushes, and sector times were displayed for the 8:00
          a.m., 9:00 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 1:00 p.m. and the 2:30 p.m. rushes.
          In each rush the TMA delay advisories were 1-2 minutes less that
          ASP and during the 2:30 p.m. rush ASP was advising 6-8 minute
          delays while the TMA was advising only 1-3 minutes.

   Friday, June 21, 1996, 9:00 a.m. rush
          The TMA was used for the 9:00 a.m. rush prior to the NASA TMA
          evaluation team departing for the weekend. For this rush the ASP
          system was advising 6-8 minutes and the TMA was advising 2-4
          minutes of delay.

  TMA Operational Evaluations at ZFW & DFW

    June 14, 1996

   The CTAS tool known as the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) was
   operated in its full operational mode during the noon rush from the Ft.
   Worth Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZFW) to the Dallas Ft. Worth
   (DFW) TRACON on Friday June 14, 1996. The noon rush is often
   characterized as an extremely heavy rush with typical delays of 5 - 10
   minutes per aircraft. It is also considered to have heavy sector
   controller workload due to the predominance of flights from the West
   coast.

   At 11:00 a.m. CDT the TMA Traffic Management Coordinator Lead advised
   the Traffic Management Unit and the Traffic Management Officer of the
   intention of the NASA/FAA TMA evaluation team to run the TMA as the
   primary flow control and advisory system for ZFW. The TMC lead
   coordinated with the DFW TRACON advising them of the fact that the TMA
   was to be used operationally for the noon rush. The DFW TRACON gave ZFW
   the approval and a DFW airport arrival rate of 108 (nominally the AAR
   is 102). The CTAS NATCA Technology representative and TMC controller
   coordinator advised ZFW's operational floor of the use of TMA for the
   noon rush. The NASA TMA engineering team placed the appropriate
   configurations and settings into the TMA as per instructions by the TMC
   lead. After observing the TMA and ASP system for a few minutes the
   decision was made to run the TMA operationally instead of ASP. The
   delays indicated by the TMA were on the order of 2-3 minutes and 3-4
   minutes for ASP. At 11:15 the TMA sector advisories were transmitted to
   the sector Plan View Displays (PVDs). The sector controllers were
   advised to start using the TMA generated advisories at 11:25 for the
   high altitude controllers and 11:33 for the low. The CTAS NATCA
   representative took the initiative to coordinate and advise his
   counterpart at DFW TRACON as well as coordinating throughout the
   operational floor at ZFW.

   The evaluation was successfully conducted from 11:25 until 12:05 CDT
   when the last aircraft in the rush was placed into the TMA sequence.
   The feedback from the ZFW floor, as reported by the CTAS NATCA
   representative, was once the controllers had sequenced the aircraft,
   the vast majority of the TMA sequences and crossing advisories fell
   right into place. The CTAS TMC lead indicated that the decision to
   issue the TMA advisories was based upon the information from the TMA
   and that for this situation it could have gone either way. The DFW
   TRACON indicated that the flow supplied from ZFW was workable. Once the
   evaluation was completed at 12:05 a return to normal ZFW operations was
   initiated with the normal post noon demand drop-off. The initial data
   analysis indicated that the airlines were saved one to two minutes per
   aircraft.

   The TMA first operational evaluation is considered an unqualified
   success by the NASA/FAA evaluation team.
