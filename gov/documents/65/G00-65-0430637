   With the unanimous endorsement from every major California newspaper,
   Bill Jones was elected to serve a second term as California's Secretary
   of State in 1998. As the State's Chief Elections Officer, Secretary
   Jones has aggressively set new standards for the office - 100 percent
   voter participation with zero tolerance for fraud - while
   simultaneously leading the way in implementing the latest technology to
   California government.

   Secretary Jones' accomplishments in voter outreach programs -
   especially to California's minorities and young people - is testament
   to his goal of reaching all voters, and have become the standard
   throughout the nation. Realizing the disconnect between young people
   and government, Jones went directly to our high schools to create a
   CIVICS curriculum now in use by teachers to help engage students in the
   political process. Committed to tomorrow's leaders, Secretary Jones has
   dedicated himself to understanding the concerns of California's youth.

   During his tenure in the State Assembly, Bill Jones received national
   acclaim when he authored California's immensely successful
   "Three-Strikes and You're Out" law - the nation's toughest anti-crime
   legislation that has helped bring crime to a 35-year low. As Secretary
   of State, Jones remains in the state and national spotlight, appearing
   before the U.S. Supreme Court to defend California's open primary law,
   as well as successfully defending term limits in the U.S. Ninth Circuit
   Court of Appeals.

   Committed to putting Californians on-line instead of in-line when
   seeking government services, Secretary Jones has taken the lead in
   developing technological solutions to increase both ease and efficiency
   to all California government. The most advanced in the nation,
   Secretary Jones' Internet site provides comprehensive information on
   many useful services, including campaign finance and lobbying reports,
   business filings information, and live, immediate vote totals on
   election-night.

   Prior to his tenure in the State Assembly, Jones, a native California
   Rancher, continues to work on his family-owned farm in Fresno.
