   Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy Measures Carbon in Soils in a Flash

   The U.S. Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists
   have developed a small, portable instrument that uses a laser to analyze the
   amount of carbon in soils, which can give scientists a better understanding
   of terrestrial processes that could accelerate or retard global warming. The
   new technology was highlighted in the November-December 2001 issue of the
   Journal of Environmental Quality.

   The bright flash on the soil sample is where a pulse of laser light
   vaporizes a bit of the soil. By analyzing the spectral characteristics
   in the flash of light, the researchers are able to determine the amount
   of carbon contained in the soil. Carbon-LIBS is being developed to
   allow scientists to determine the carbon budget of terrestrial
   areas-knowledge that can help scientists gain a better understanding of
   forces that influence global warming. (Photo by James E. Rickman, Los

      November 26With increasing international concern about greenhouse
      gases and global warming, scientists have sought better and more
      cost-effective approaches for measuring changes in the amount of
      land-based carbon, much of which is located in soils. But because the
      amount of carbon varies considerably from one spot to the next,
      measuring significant changes in land-based carbon in fields, ranch
      lands and forests is difficult.

      The newly developed Los Alamos technology will aid scientists as they
      try to determine how soil-based carbon is released into the air through
      natural or manmade causes, or whether atmospheric carbon is being
      absorbed into soils.

      "Carbon truly is the currency of life," said Los Alamos ecologist David
      Breshears, a co-author of the paper. "For years, scientists have sought
      to improve accounting of Earth's carbon budget. This instrument will
      help us improve that accounting and our understanding of how soil
      carbon responds to different types of land management."

      Using a technology called Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopyknown
      simply as LIBSscientists can now point a flashlight-sized laser device
      at a soil sample in the field or taken from the ground and determine
      how much carbon the sample contains. LIBS works by firing a brief, very
      intense pulse of laser light at a surface. The laser beam vaporizes a
      spot on the target sample that's roughly the size of a pencil point. A
      small spotting scope mounted near the laser source captures light
      emitted from the vaporized area and directs it to a spectral analyzer.

      This analyzer, part of the LIBS device, looks at the signature of the
      light to determine what elements are present. Each element creates its
      own spectral fingerprint.

      In field trials conducted on agricultural soil, the research team, led
      by Los Alamos physicist David Cremers and soil scientist Michael
      Ebinger, configured the spectral analyzer to measure the carbon
      signature coming from the soil. Subsequent field trials on woodland
      soils with Carbon-LIBS, or C-LIBS for short, have shown that the
      instrument can be used reliably to determine the carbon content of
      different soils.

      The Los Alamos researchers plan to take the instrument to other areas
      to determine how C-LIBS can be used to quantify carbon in soils
      throughout the world.

      "With C-LIBS, we now have a rapid way to collect many measurements of
      soil carbon and come up with better estimates of how much carbon is in
      a field plot or across a landscape, and how that amount of carbon is
      changing over time," Ebinger said.

      Added Breshears, "Appropriate land management could increase soil
      carbon retention. Conversely, disturbances like fires could result in
      rapid losses of soil carbon. We plan to apply C-LIBS to help scientists
      get a better handle on these tradeoffs."

      Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy technology itself is not new.
      Earth and space scientists have proposed using the technology to
      determine the composition of the surfaces of other planets, asteroids,
      moons and comets. The device is small, rugged and portable, and is easy
      to use and maintain. In other Earth-bound applications, LIBS can
      analyze samples from as far as 50 feet away, or can be used to analyze
      areas inside tight nooks and crannies that might not be convenient to
      sample by conventional methods.

      The C-LIBS team includes Breshears, Cremers, Ebinger, Los Alamos
      biologist Pat Unkefer, and Joel Brown of the U.S. Department of
      Agriculture.
