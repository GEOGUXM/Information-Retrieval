      IMAGERS: Interactive Multimedia Adventures for Grade-school Education
      using Remote Sensing

                                  NEWS and AWARDS

   The Echo the Bat book is now here!

   After a long awaited release, Echo the Bat is now available in print.
   The goal of this book is to introduce remote sensing to our youngest
   future scientists. The book retells the story of Echo to children ages
   5 - 9 (but I have been told some older folks have secretly read the
   book). When Echo launches his adventure, he is followed by a satellite.
   Landsat images of the five habitats Echo travels provides a backdrop
   for the adventure. The text emphasizes shape, pattern, and texture and
   refers to the many flaps in the images. When the flaps are lifted,
   pictures of the land features are displayed underneath. This is
   definately a great resource for parents and teachers alike. To learn
   more, visit the Echo the Bat book page. Or, to order your own copy,
   visit http://bookstore.gpo.gov/market.

   To learn more about the author, check out the August 24th edition of
   Goddard News.


   Pigeon Adventure Wins Proposal

   WASHINGTON, DC. December 10th. The Pigeon Adventure: An Adventure
   through Remote Sensing History was selected in the NASA Research
   Announcements for participation in the Earth Science Education Program.
   The monies made available from NASA will enable this project to
   incorporate more interactive technology including Shockwave Flash
   animations and take advantage of the new QuickTime 4.0 technology. The
   site will also have more audio to appeal to the younger target audience
   of K-4. We will also develop under this proposal 20 activities that can
   be used without a computer and in the formal and informal educational
   setting for children in K-4.

   Initial work on the Pigeon project is made possible through funding
   from Goddard's Laboratory for Terrestrial Physics and Tennesse State
   University (MU-SPIN/NRTS program). This award from NASA's Earth Science
   Education Program will greatly shorten the development cycle and
   increase the amount of interactive technology within the adventure.

   Look for story development and testing information of the Pigeon
   Adventure on the IMAGERS web site February 2000. See NASA's Earth
   Science Enterprise web site for a full list of selected proposals.



   Echo the Bat awarded Outstanding Educational Product


   AUSTIN, TX. November 17th. Ginger Butcher accepts award from NASA's
   Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) for the Echo the Bat web site. The NASA
   ESE review board rated Echo the Bat as an "Outstanding Education
   Product" and recommended the product for broad distribution. This
   review is the final step before an ESE education product goes into
   national publication. The site is now published in the ESE Education
   Product Catalog and will be part of hundreds of NASA teacher training
   workshops across the county.

   ECHO the BAT pop-up book is ESE approved and hits the press!!

   SPRING 1999, Beth Broadhurst, Education Curator at the Baltimore Zoo
   together with Echo the Bat creator Ginger Butcher, wrote and
   illustrated an Echo the Bat pop-up book. This book, along with hands-on
   activities, was created to meet NASA's needs for K-4 educational
   material in Earth Science. Thanks to funding from Tennessee State
   University, through the MU-SPIN program, we were able to create this
   book in a little over a month.

   FALL 1999, The Echo the Bat book has been recommended for
   "Broad-Distribution" by reviewers in NASA's Peer Review of Earth
   Science Educational Products. The Institute for Global Environmental
   Strategies (IGES) managed the intensive review with teams of reviewers
   carefully selected by IGES to ensure the following expertise was
   represented: a teacher with classroom experience at the level of the
   targeted audience; an Earth system scientist; a curriculum writer
   familiar with national science education standards; a media specialist;
   and an instructional designer. The reviewers rated The Echo the Bat
   pop-up book as an outstanding education product and recommended it for
   broad distribution - meaning it is an excellent candidate for national
   distribution by NASA with no need for special training or instruction
   (e.g.,national education conferences, such as NSTA, NASA Educator
   Resource Centers, etc.) and is also good for use in NASA teacher
   workshops. The books are scheduled to go to the printers in mid-January
   2000 and should be available by spring 2000.
   Through funding from the Goddard's Laboratory for Terrestrial Physics,
   NASA's MU-SPIN program and NASA's Earth Science Enterprise, copies of
   the book should be available through teacher workshops. We are
   currently discussing distribution options and will post details when
   available on this site. So check back in a few months for information
   on how you can get a copy of the Echo the Bat book. The K-4 activities
   that accompany the book are available online.
   Echo the Bat for the visually-impaired

   The USGS Biological Resources Division has contributed funds to the
   project in order to revise the Echo the Bat web site for disabled
   access. Along with format changes and added descriptions, we will
   experiement with audio displays using Shockwave and/or QuickTime
   technology. This could possibly allow visually impaired children to
   explore satellite imagery through via sound. The complere report on
   recommended revisions to the Echo the Bat site for accessibility is
   available online.

   The revised site is scheduled to launch in Fall 2000. Anyone interested
   in participating in our efforts, please feel free to contact Ginger
   Butcher for more information.
   SCIENCE Magazine, April 30, 1999

   "Remote imagery might seem a bit complex to explain to kids, but this
   site pulls it off with satellite images that help tell the story of a
   bat tooling around Arizona's eco-systems. Aimed at middle school
   students, the site folds in lessons about the electromagnetic spectrum,
   ecology and more."

   Jocelyn Kaiser, in her NetWatch column of Science magazine

   Washington Times, May 23, 1999

     Echo the Bat illustration printed in the Washington Times Newspaper
                                   article

   Joe Szadkowski of the Washington Times reviewed the Echo the Bat web
   site for his NETWISE column in the Family Times. This 2/3 page feature
   article included a collage of illustrations from the web site and some
   fantastic comments.

   "USER COMMENTS: The site is easy to load, and the satellite images are
   clear. Special compliments go to Miss Butcher, the story writer and
   illustrator. She did an excellent job with this delightful children's
   tale. Just remember to have the latest browser installed, or it will be
   a short-lived Web adventure.

   CYBERSITTER SYNOPSIS: Children will go batty for this site, and I
   wouldn't expect too much roaming to other parts of the Internet.

    FAMILY FUN FACTOR: 100 percent.

    INFORMATION GRADE: A+"

   Comments about Echo the Bat

   "I'm currently working on an article on Earth Day activities in which I
   reference your site. I just wanted to let you know how terrific it is!
   It is, without a doubt, one of the best examples of the correct use of
   instructional technology that I've ever seen. It's extremely
   well-written, the story and activities are engaging and educationally
   sound, and the Teacher's Guide is terrific--exceptionally valuable.
   (Can you tell how much I loved it?) Someday I'm going to do an article
   on the Web sites that show how educational technology SHOULD be
   used--and your site will be at the top of my list! Are you planning any
   more sites like this? Anyway, I was really bowled over by the quality
   of this activity and wanted to let you know that. Thanks! "

   "After making a comment this morning about how many of the websites are
   much ado about nothing, I had to eat my words when I found your site.
   Bravo.! We are hanging a picture of Echo on our bat box"

   "This is a great tool for teachers to use since everything for the
   lesson is right there. It is great how you wrote the story and then
   linked it to two topics, electromagnetic spectrum and remote sensing.
   The teacher's guide was wonderful and full of great ideas. Thanks for
   creating this great site for me, and other teachers, to use in our
   classrooms."

   Nina Hoffman, Middle School Teacher in Maryland

   "I used Echo myself to better understand the electromagnetic spectrum
   and remote sensing. The lessons were easy to use and the exercises
   supported the lessons. What made the whole "red, green, blue" concepts
   click for me was the coloring page. I LOVED IT and I could demonstrate
   that I learned something too!"
