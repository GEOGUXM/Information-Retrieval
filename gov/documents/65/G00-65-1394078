   Definition of Terms:

   FLSA Code = E : Exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act. Premium pay

   Event within the Agency's administrative control - Based on Comptroller
   General (CG) decisions, travel on overtime to and from an event
   arranged at the discretion of an agency (or agencies) is not
   compensable (with some exceptions) since the agency has it within its
   power to ensure that the employee travels during work hours. For the
   same reason, travel to and from training which is conducted by the
   government, under government contract, or by private institution (where
   the majority of students are federal employees) is not compensable
   since the agency has within its power to control the training schedule.
   Note: Overtime for travel is not compensable if the scheduled training
   is not essential to the performance of duties.

     leaves at noon with a check-in time of 11:30 a.m. It would be
     reasonable to pay overtime for all time after 10 a.m.
