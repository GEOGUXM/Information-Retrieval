   OGE 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 PART 2635 - STANDARDS OF ETHICAL CONDUCT FOR
   EMPLOYEES OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SUBPART A - GENERAL PROVISIONS §
   2635.101 Basic obligation of public service. (a) Public service is a
   public trust . Each employee has a responsibility to the United States
   Government and its citizens to place loyalty to the Constitution, laws
   and ethical principles above private gain. To ensure that every citizen
   can have complete confidence in the integrity of the Federal
   Government, each employee shall respect and adhere to the principles of
   ethical conduct set forth in this section, as well as the implementing
   standards contained in this part and in supplemental agency
   regulations. (b) General principles . The following general principles
   apply to every employee and may form the basis for the standards
   contained in this part. Where a situation is not covered by the
   standards set forth in this part, employees shall apply the principles
   set forth in this section in determining whether their conduct is
   proper. (1) Public service is a public trust, requiring employees to
   place loyalty to the Constitution, the laws and ethical principles
   above private gain. (2) Employees shall not hold financial interests
   that conflict with the conscientious performance of duty. (3) Employees
   shall not engage in financial transactions using nonpublic Government
   information or allow the improper use of such information to further
   any private interest. (4) An employee shall not, except as permitted by
   subpart B of this part, solicit or accept any gift or other item of
   monetary value from any person or entity seeking official action from,
   doing business with, or conducting activities regulated by the
   employee's agency, or whose interests may be substantially affected by
   the performance or nonperformance of the employee's duties. (5)
   Employees shall put forth honest effort in the performance of their
   duties. (6) Employees shall not knowingly make unauthorized commitments
   or promises of any kind purporting to bind the Government. (7)
   Employees shall not use public office for private gain. OGE OGE 1 9/30/
   9/ 99 30/99 (8) Employees shall act impartially and not give
   preferential treatment to any private organization or individual. (9)
   Employees shall protect and conserve Federal property and shall not use
   it for other than authorized activities. (10) Employees shall not
   engage in outside employment or activities, including seeking or
   negotiating for employment, that conflict with official Government
   duties and responsibilities. (11) Employees shall disclose waste,
   fraud, abuse, and corruption to appropriate authorities. (12) Employees
   shall satisfy in good faith their obligations as citizens, including
   all just financial obligations, especially those--such as Federal,
   State, or local taxes--that are imposed by law. (13) Employees shall
   adhere to all laws and regulations that provide equal opportunity for
   all Americans regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national
   origin, age, or handicap. (14) Employees shall endeavor to avoid any
   actions creating the appearance that they are violating the law or the
   ethical standards set forth in this part. Whether particular
   circumstances create an appearance that the law or these standards have
   been violated shall be determined from the perspective of a reasonable
   person with knowledge of the relevant facts. (c) Related statutes. In
   addition to the standards of ethical conduct set forth in this part,
   there are conflict of interest statutes that prohibit certain conduct.
   Criminal conflict of interest statutes of general applicability to all
   employees, 18 U.S.C. 201, 203, 205, 208, and 209, are summarized in the
   appropriate subparts of this part and must be taken into consideration
   in determining whether conduct is proper. Citations to other generally
   applicable statutes relating to employee conduct are set forth in
   subpart I and employees are further cautioned that there may be
   additional statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to them
   generally or as employees of their specific agencies. Because an
   employee is considered to be on notice of the requirements of any
   statute, an employee should not rely upon any description or synopsis
   of a statutory restriction, but should refer to the statute itself and
   obtain the advice of an agency ethics official as needed. § 2635.102
   Definitions. The definitions listed below are used throughout this
   part. Additional definitions appear in the subparts or sections of
   subparts to which they apply. For purposes of this part: OGE OGE 2
   9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 (a) Agency means an executive agency as defined in 5
   U.S.C. 105 and the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission. It

   District of Columbia. (b) Agency designee refers to any employee who,
   by agency regulation, instruction, or other issuance, has been
   delegated authority to make any determination, give any approval, or
   take any other action required or permitted by this part with respect
   to another employee. An agency may delegate these authorities to any
   number of agency designees necessary to ensure that determinations are
   made, approvals are given, and other actions are taken in a timely and
   responsible manner. Any provision that requires a determination,
   approval, or other action by the agency designee shall, where the
   conduct in issue is that of the agency head, be deemed to require that
   such determination, approval or action be made or taken by the agency
   head in consultation with the designated agency ethics official. (c)
   Agency ethics official refers to the designated agency ethics official
   or to the alternate designated agency ethics official, referred to in §
   2638.202(b) of this chapter, and to any deputy ethics official,
   described in § 2638.204 of this chapter, who has been delegated
   authority to assist in carrying out the responsibilities of the
   designated agency ethics official. (d) Agency programs or operations
   refers to any program or function carried out or performed by an
   agency, whether pursuant to statute, Executive order, or regulation.
   (e) Corrective action includes any action necessary to remedy a past
   violation or prevent a continuing violation of this part, including but
   not limited to restitution, change of assignment, disqualification,
   divestiture, termination of an activity, waiver, the creation of a
   qualified diversified or blind trust, or counseling. (f) Designated
   agency ethics official refers to the official designated under §
   2638.201 of this chapter. (g) Disciplinary action includes those
   disciplinary actions referred to in Office of Personnel Management
   regulations and instructions implementing provisions of title 5 of the
   United States Code or provided for in comparable provisions applicable
   to employees not subject to title 5, including but not limited to
   reprimand, suspension, demotion, and removal. In the case of a military
   officer, comparable provisions may include those in the Uniform Code of
   Military Justice. (h) Employee means any officer or employee of an
   agency, including a special Government employee. It includes officers
   but not enlisted members of the uniformed services. For purposes other
   than subparts B and C of this part, it does not include the President
   or Vice President. Status as an employee is unaffected by pay or leave
   status or, in the case of a special Government employee, by the fact
   that the individual does not perform official duties on a given day.
   OGE OGE 3 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 (i) Head of an agency means, in the case of
   an agency headed by more than one person, the chair or comparable
   member of such agency. (j) He, his, and him include she, hers and her.
   (k) Person means an individual, corporation and subsidiaries it
   controls, company, association, firm, partnership, society, joint stock
   company, or any other organization or institution, including any
   officer, employee, or agent of such person or entity. For purposes of
   this part, a corporation will be deemed to control a subsidiary if it
   owns 50 percent or more of the subsidiary's voting securities. The term
   is all-inclusive and applies to commercial ventures and nonprofit
   organizations as well as to foreign, State, and local governments,
   including the Government of the District of Columbia. It does not
   include any agency or other entity of the Federal Government or any
   officer or employee thereof when acting in his official capacity on
   behalf of that agency or entity. (l) Special Government employee means
   those executive branch officers or employees specified in 18 U.S.C.
   202(a). A special Government employee is retained, designated,
   appointed, or employed to perform temporary duties either on a
   full-time or intermittent basis, with or without compensation, for a
   period not to exceed 130 days during any consecutive 365-day period.
   (m) Supplemental agency regulation means a regulation issued pursuant
   to § 2635.105. § 2635.103 Applicability to members of the uniformed
   services. The provisions of this part, except this section, are not
   applicable to enlisted members of the uniformed services. Each agency
   with jurisdiction over enlisted members of the uniformed services shall
   issue regulations defining the ethical conduct obligations of enlisted
   members under its jurisdiction. Those regulations shall be consistent
   with Executive Order 12674, April 12, 1989, as modified, and may
   prescribe the full range of statutory and regulatory sanctions,
   including those available under the Uniform Code of Military Justice,
   for failure to comply with such regulations. § 2635.104 Applicability
   to employees on detail. (a) Details to other agencies . Except as
   provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an employee on detail,
   including a uniformed officer on assignment, from his employing agency
   to another agency for a period in excess of 30 calendar days shall be
   subject to any supplemental agency regulations of the agency to which
   he is detailed rather than to any supplemental agency regulations of
   his employing agency. (b) Details to the legislative or judicial branch
   . An employee on detail, including a uniformed officer on assignment,
   from his employing agency to the legislative or judicial branch for a
   period in excess of 30 calendar days shall be subject to the ethical
   standards of the branch or OGE OGE 4 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 entity to which
   detailed. For the duration of any such detail or assignment, the
   employee shall not be subject to the provisions of this part, except
   this section, or, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section,
   to any supplemental agency regulations of his employing agency, but
   shall remain subject to the conflict of interest prohibitions in title
   18 of the United States Code. (c) Details to non-Federal entities .
   Except to the extent exempted in writing pursuant to this paragraph, an
   employee detailed to a non-Federal entity remains subject to this part
   and to any supplemental agency regulation of his employing agency. When
   an employee is detailed pursuant to statutory authority to an
   international organization or to a State or local government for a
   period in excess of six months, the designated agency ethics official
   may grant a written exemption from subpart B of this part based on his
   determination that the entity has adopted written ethical standards
   covering solicitation and acceptance of gifts which will apply to the
   employee during the detail and which will be appropriate given the
   purpose of the detail. (d) Applicability of special agency statutes.
   Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, an employee who
   is subject to an agency statute which restricts his activities or
   financial holdings specifically because of his status as an employee of
   that agency shall continue to be subject to any provisions in the
   supplemental agency regulations of his employing agency that implement
   that statute. § 2635.105 Supplemental agency regulations. In addition
   to the regulations set forth in this part, an employee shall comply
   with any supplemental agency regulations issued by his employing agency
   under this section. (a) An agency that wishes to supplement this part
   shall prepare and submit to the Office of Government Ethics, for its
   concurrence and joint issuance, any agency regulations that supplement
   the regulations contained in this part. Supplemental agency regulations
   which the agency determines are necessary and appropriate, in view of
   its programs and operations, to fulfill the purposes of this part shall
   be: (1) In the form of a supplement to the regulations in this part;
   and (2) In addition to the substantive provisions of this part. (b)
   After concurrence and co-signature by the Office of Government Ethics,
   the agency shall submit its supplemental agency regulations to the
   Federal Register for publication and codification at the expense of the
   agency in title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Supplemental
   agency regulations issued under this section are effective only after
   concurrence and co-signature by the Office of Government Ethics and
   publication in the Federal Register. OGE OGE 5 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 (c)
   This section applies to any supplemental agency regulations or
   amendments thereof issued under this part. It does not apply to: (1) A
   handbook or other issuance intended merely as an explanation of the
   standards contained in this part or in supplemental agency regulations;
   (2) An instruction or other issuance the purpose of which is to: (i)
   Delegate to an agency designee authority to make any determination,
   give any approval or take any other action required or permitted by
   this part or by supplemental agency regulations; or (ii) Establish
   internal agency procedures for documenting or processing any
   determination, approval or other action required or permitted by this
   part or by supplemental agency regulations, or for retaining any such
   documentation; or (3) Regulations or instructions that an agency has
   authority, independent of this part, to issue, such as regulations
   implementing an agency's gift acceptance statute, protecting categories
   of nonpublic information or establishing standards for use of
   Government vehicles. Where the content of any such regulations or
   instructions was included in the agency's standards of conduct
   regulations issued pursuant to Executive Order 11222 and the Office of
   Government Ethics concurs that they need not be issued as part of an
   agency's supplemental agency regulations, those regulations or
   instructions may be promulgated separately from the agency's
   supplemental agency regulations. § 2635.106 Disciplinary and corrective
   action. (a) Except as provided in § 2635.107, a violation of this part
   or of supplemental agency regulations may be cause for appropriate
   corrective or disciplinary action to be taken under applicable
   Governmentwide regulations or agency procedures. Such action may be in
   addition to any action or penalty prescribed by law. (b) It is the
   responsibility of the employing agency to initiate appropriate
   disciplinary or corrective action in individual cases. However,
   corrective action may be ordered or disciplinary action recommended by
   the Director of the Office of Government Ethics under the procedures at
   part 2638 of this chapter. (c) A violation of this part or of
   supplemental agency regulations, as such, does not create any right or
   benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any person
   against the United States, its agencies, its officers or employees, or
   any other person. Thus, for example, an individual who alleges that an
   employee has failed to adhere to laws and regulations that provide
   equal opportunity regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national
   origin, age, or handicap is required OGE OGE 6 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 to
   follow applicable statutory and regulatory procedures, including those
   of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. § 2635.107 Ethics
   advice. (a) As required by §§ 2638.201 and 2638.202(b) of this chapter,
   each agency has a designated agency ethics official who, on the
   agency's behalf, is responsible for coordinating and managing the
   agency's ethics program, as well as an alternate. The designated agency
   ethics official has authority under § 2638.204 of this chapter to
   delegate certain responsibilities, including that of providing ethics
   counseling regarding the application of this part, to one or more
   deputy ethics officials. (b) Employees who have questions about the
   application of this part or any supplemental agency regulations to
   particular situations should seek advice from an agency ethics
   official. Disciplinary action for violating this part or any
   supplemental agency regulations will not be taken against an employee
   who has engaged in conduct in good faith reliance upon the advice of an
   agency ethics official, provided that the employee, in seeking such
   advice, has made full disclosure of all relevant circumstances. Where
   the employee's conduct violates a criminal statute, reliance on the
   advice of an agency ethics official cannot ensure that the employee
   will not be prosecuted under that statute. However, good faith reliance
   on the advice of an agency ethics official is a factor that may be
   taken into account by the Department of Justice in the selection of
   cases for prosecution. Disclosures made by an employee to an agency
   ethics official are not protected by an attorney-client privilege. An
   agency ethics official is required by 28 U.S.C. 535 to report any
   information he receives relating to a violation of the criminal code,
   title 18 of the United States Code. OGE OGE 7 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 SUBPART
   B - GIFTS FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES § 2635.201 Overview. This subpart
   contains standards that prohibit an employee from soliciting or
   accepting any gift from a prohibited source or given because of the
   employee's official position unless the item is excluded from the
   definition of a gift or falls within one of the exceptions set forth in
   this subpart. § 2635.202 General standards. (a) General prohibitions .
   Except as provided in this subpart, an employee shall not, directly or
   indirectly, solicit or accept a gift: (1) From a prohibited source; or
   (2) Given because of the employee's official position. (b) Relationship
   to illegal gratuities statute . Unless accepted in violation of
   paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a gift accepted under the standards
   set forth in this subpart shall not constitute an illegal gratuity
   otherwise prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 201(c)(1)(B). (c) Limitations on use
   of exceptions. Notwithstanding any exception provided in this subpart,
   other than § 2635.204(j), an employee shall not: (1) Accept a gift in
   return for being influenced in the performance of an official act; (2)
   Solicit or coerce the offering of a gift; (3) Accept gifts from the
   same or different sources on a basis so frequent that a reasonable
   person would be led to believe the employee is using his public office
   for private gain; Example 1: A purchasing agent for a Veterans
   Administration hospital routinely deals with representatives of
   pharmaceutical manufacturers who provide information about new company
   products. Because of his crowded calendar, the purchasing agent has
   offered to meet with manufacturer representatives during his lunch
   hours Tuesdays through Thursdays and the representatives routinely
   arrive at the employee's office bringing a sandwich and a soft drink
   for the employee. Even though the market value of each of the lunches
   is less than $6 and the aggregate value from any one manufacturer does
   not exceed the $50 aggregate limitation in § 2635.204(a) on de minimis
   gifts of $20 or less, the practice of accepting even these modest gifts
   on a recurring basis is improper . OGE OGE 8 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 (4)
   Accept a gift in violation of any statute. Relevant statutes applicable
   to all employees include: (i) 18 U.S.C. 201(b), which prohibits a
   public official from seeking, accepting, or agreeing to receive or
   accept anything of value in return for being influenced in the
   performance of an official act or for being induced to take or omit to
   take any action in violation of his official duty. As used in 18 U.S.C.
   201(b), the term "public official" is broadly construed and includes
   regular and special Government employees as well as all other
   Government officials; and (ii) 18 U.S.C. 209, which prohibits an
   employee, other than a special Government employee, from receiving any
   salary or any contribution to or supplementation of salary from any
   source other than the United States as compensation for services as a
   Government employee. The statute contains several specific exceptions
   to this general prohibition, including an exception for contributions
   made from the treasury of a State, county, or municipality; or (5)
   Accept vendor promotional training contrary to applicable regulations,
   policies or guidance relating to the procurement of supplies and
   services for the Government, except pursuant to § 2635.204(l). §
   2635.203 Definitions. For purposes of this subpart, the following
   definitions shall apply: (a) Agency has the meaning set forth in §
   2635.102(a). However, for purposes of this subpart, an executive
   department, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 101, may, by supplemental agency
   regulation, designate as a separate agency any component of that
   department which the department determines exercises distinct and
   separate functions. (b) Gift includes any gratuity, favor, discount,
   entertainment, hospitality, loan, forbearance, or other item having
   monetary value. It includes services as well as gifts of training,
   transportation, local travel, lodgings and meals, whether provided
   in-kind, by purchase of a ticket, payment in advance, or reimbursement
   after the expense has been incurred. It does not include: (1) Modest
   items of food and refreshments, such as soft drinks, coffee and donuts,
   offered other than as part of a meal; (2) Greeting cards and items with
   little intrinsic value, such as plaques, certificates, and trophies,
   which are intended solely for presentation; OGE OGE 9 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99
   (3) Loans from banks and other financial institutions on terms
   generally available to the public; (4) Opportunities and benefits,
   including favorable rates and commercial discounts, available to the
   public or to a class consisting of all Government employees or all
   uniformed military personnel, whether or not restricted on the basis of
   geographic considerations; (5) Rewards and prizes given to competitors
   in contests or events, including random drawings, open to the public
   unless the employee's entry into the contest or event is required as
   part of his official duties; (6) Pension and other benefits resulting
   from continued participation in an employee welfare and benefits plan
   maintained by a former employer; (7) Anything which is paid for by the
   Government or secured by the Government under Government contract;
   Note: Some airlines encourage those purchasing tickets to join programs
   that award free flights and other benefits to frequent fliers. Any such
   benefit earned on the basis of Government-financed travel belongs to
   the agency rather than to the employee and may be accepted only insofar
   as provided under 41 CFR part 301-53. (8) Any gift accepted by the
   Government under specific statutory authority, including: (i) Travel,
   subsistence, and related expenses accepted by an agency under the
   authority of 31 U.S.C. 1353 in connection with an employee's attendance
   at a meeting or similar function relating to his official duties which
   takes place away from his duty station. The agency's acceptance must be
   in accordance with the implementing regulations at 41 CFR part 304-1;
   and (ii) Other gifts provided in-kind which have been accepted by an
   agency under its agency gift acceptance statute; or (9) Anything for
   which market value is paid by the employee. (c) Market value means the
   retail cost the employee would incur to purchase the gift. An employee
   who cannot ascertain the market value of a gift may estimate its market
   value by reference to the retail cost of similar items of like quality.
   The market value of a gift of a ticket entitling the holder to food,
   refreshments, entertainment, or any other benefit shall be the face
   value of the ticket. Example 1: An employee who has been given an
   acrylic paperweight embedded with the corporate logo of a prohibited
   source may determine its market value based on her observation OGE OGE
   10 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 that a comparable acrylic paperweight, not
   embedded with a logo, generally sells for about $20. Example 2: A
   prohibited source has offered an employee a ticket to a charitable
   event consisting of a cocktail reception to be followed by an evening
   of chamber music. Even though the food, refreshments, and entertainment
   provided at the event may be worth only $20, the market value of the
   ticket is its $250 face value. (d) Prohibited source means any person
   who: (1) Is seeking official action by the employee's agency; (2) Does
   business or seeks to do business with the employee's agency; (3)
   Conducts activities regulated by the employee's agency; (4) Has
   interests that may be substantially affected by performance or
   nonperformance of the employee's official duties; or (5) Is an
   organization a majority of whose members are described in paragraphs
   (d) (1) through (4) of this section. (e) A gift is solicited or
   accepted because of the employee's official position if it is from a
   person other than an employee and would not have been solicited,
   offered, or given had the employee not held the status, authority or
   duties associated with his Federal position. Note: Gifts between
   employees are subject to the limitations set forth in subpart C of this
   part. Example 1: Where free season tickets are offered by an opera
   guild to all members of the Cabinet, the gift is offered because of
   their official positions. Example 2. Employees at a regional office of
   the Department of Justice (DOJ) work in Government-leased space at a
   private office building, along with various private business tenants. A
   major fire in the building during normal office hours causes a
   traumatic experience for all occupants of the building in making their
   escape, and it is the subject of widespread news coverage. A corporate
   hotel chain, which does not meet the definition of a prohibited source
   for DOJ, seizes the moment and announces that it will give a free
   night's lodging to all building occupants and their families, as a
   public goodwill gesture. Employees of DOJ may accept, as this gift is
   not being given because of their Government positions. The donor's
   motivation for offering this gift is unrelated to the DOJ employees'
   status, authority or duties associated with their Federal position, but
   instead is based on their mere presence in the building as occupants at
   the time of the fire. (f) A gift which is solicited or accepted
   indirectly includes a gift: OGE OGE 11 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 (1) Given with
   the employee's knowledge and acquiescence to his parent, sibling,
   spouse, child, or dependent relative because of that person's
   relationship to the employee, or (2) Given to any other person,
   including any charitable organization, on the basis of designation,
   recommendation, or other specification by the employee, except as
   permitted for the disposition of perishable items by § 2635.205(a)(2)
   or for payments made to charitable organizations in lieu of honoraria
   under § 2636.204 of this chapter. Example 1: An employee who must
   decline a gift of a personal computer pursuant to this subpart may not
   suggest that the gift be given instead to one of five charitable
   organizations whose names are provided by the employee. (g) Vendor
   promotional training means training provided by any person for the
   purpose of promoting its products or services. It does not include
   training provided under a Government contract or by a contractor to
   facilitate use of products or services it furnishes under a Government
   contract. § 2635.204 Exceptions. The prohibitions set forth in §
   2635.202(a) do not apply to a gift accepted under the circumstances
   described in paragraphs (a) through (l) of this section, and an
   employee's acceptance of a gift in accordance with one of those
   paragraphs will be deemed not to violate the principles set forth in §
   2635.101(b), including appearances. Even though acceptance of a gift
   may be permitted by one of the exceptions contained in paragraphs (a)
   through (l) of this section, it is never inappropriate and frequently
   prudent for an employee to decline a gift offered by a prohibited
   source or because of his official position. (a) Gifts of $20 or less.
   An employee may accept unsolicited gifts having an aggregate market
   value of $20 or less per source per occasion, provided that the
   aggregate market value of individual gifts received from any one person
   under the authority of this paragraph shall not exceed $50 in a
   calendar year. This exception does not apply to gifts of cash or of
   investment interests such as stock, bonds, or certificates of deposit.
   Where the market value of a gift or the aggregate market value of gifts
   offered on any single occasion exceeds $20, the employee may not pay
   the excess value over $20 in order to accept that portion of the gift
   or those gifts worth $20. Where the aggregate value of tangible items
   offered on a single occasion exceeds $20, the employee may decline any
   distinct and separate item in order to accept those items aggregating
   $20 or less. Example 1: An employee of the Securities and Exchange
   Commission and his spouse have been invited by a representative of a
   regulated entity to a Broadway play, tickets to which have a face value
   of $30 each. The aggregate market value of the gifts offered on this
   single occasion is $60, $40 more than the $20 amount that may be
   accepted for a single event or presentation. OGE OGE 12 9/30/ 9/ 99
   30/99 The employee may not accept the gift of the evening of
   entertainment. He and his spouse may attend the play only if he pays
   the full $60 value of the two tickets. Example 2: An employee of the
   Defense Mapping Agency has been invited by an association of
   cartographers to speak about his agency's role in the evolution of
   missile technology. At the conclusion of his speech, the association
   presents the employee a framed map with a market value of $18 and a
   book about the history of cartography with a market value of $15. The
   employee may accept the map or the book, but not both, since the
   aggregate value of these two tangible items exceeds $20. Example 3: On
   four occasions during the calendar year, an employee of the Defense
   Logistics Agency was given gifts worth $10 each by four employees of a
   corporation that is a DLA contractor. For purposes of applying the
   yearly $50 limitation on gifts of $20 or less from any one person, the
   four gifts must be aggregated because a person is defined at §
   2635.102(k) to mean not only the corporate entity, but its officers and
   employees as well. However, for purposes of applying the $50 aggregate
   limitation, the employee would not have to include the value of a
   birthday present received from his cousin, who is employed by the same
   corporation, if he can accept the birthday present under the exception
   at § 2635.204(b) for gifts based on a personal relationship. Example 4:
   Under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 1353 for agencies to accept payments
   from non-Federal sources in connection with attendance at certain
   meetings or similar functions, the Environmental Protection Agency has
   accepted an association's gift of travel expenses and conference fees
   for an employee of its Office of Radiation Programs to attend an
   international conference on "The Chernobyl Experience." While at the
   conference, the employee may accept a gift of $20 or less from the
   association or from another person attending the conference even though
   it was not approved in advance by the EPA. Although 31 U.S.C. 1353 is
   the only authority under which an agency may accept gifts from certain
   non-Federal sources in connection with its employees' attendance at
   such functions, a gift of $20 or less accepted under § 2635.204(a) is a
   gift to the employee rather than to his employing agency. Example 5:
   During off-duty time, an employee of the Department of Defense (DOD)
   attends a trade show involving companies that are DOD contractors. He
   is offered a $15 computer program disk at X Company's booth, a $12
   appointments calendar at Y Company's booth, and a deli lunch worth $8
   from Z Company. The employee may accept all three of these items
   because they do not exceed $20 per source, even though they total more
   than $20 at this single occasion. (b) Gifts based on a personal
   relationship . An employee may accept a gift given under circumstances
   which make it clear that the gift is motivated by a family relationship
   or personal friendship rather than the position of the employee.
   Relevant factors in making such a determination include the history of
   the relationship and whether the family member or friend personally
   pays for the gift. OGE OGE 13 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 Example 1: An employee
   of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has been dating a
   secretary employed by a member bank. For Secretary's Week, the bank has
   given each secretary 2 tickets to an off-Broadway musical review and
   has urged each to invite a family member or friend to share the evening
   of entertainment. Under the circumstances, the FDIC employee may accept
   his girlfriend's invitation to the theater. Even though the tickets
   were initially purchased by the member bank, they were given without
   reservation to the secretary to use as she wished, and her invitation
   to the employee was motivated by their personal friendship. Example 2:
   Three partners in a law firm that handles corporate mergers have
   invited an employee of the Federal Trade Commission to join them in a
   golf tournament at a private club at the firm's expense. The entry fee
   is $500 per foursome. The employee cannot accept the gift of
   one-quarter of the entry fee even though he and the three partners have
   developed an amicable relationship as a result of the firm's dealings
   with the FTC. As evidenced in part by the fact that the fees are to be
   paid by the firm, it is not a personal friendship but a business
   relationship that is the motivation behind the partners' gift. (c)
   Discounts and similar benefits. In addition to those opportunities and
   benefits excluded from the definition of a gift by § 2635.203(b)(4), an
   employee may accept: (1) Reduced membership or other fees for
   participation in organization activities offered to all Government
   employees or all uniformed military personnel by professional
   organizations if the only restrictions on membership relate to
   professional qualifications; and (2) Opportunities and benefits,
   including favorable rates and commercial discounts not precluded by
   paragraph (c)(3) of this section: (i) Offered to members of a group or
   class in which membership is unrelated to Government employment; (ii)
   Offered to members of an organization, such as an employees'
   association or agency credit union, in which membership is related to
   Government employment if the same offer is broadly available to large
   segments of the public through organizations of similar size; or (iii)
   Offered by a person who is not a prohibited source to any group or
   class that is not defined in a manner that specifically discriminates
   among Government employees on the basis of type of official
   responsibility or on a basis that favors those of higher rank or rate
   of pay; provided, however, that (3) An employee may not accept for
   personal use any benefit to which the Government is entitled as the
   result of an expenditure of Government funds. OGE OGE 14 9/30/ 9/ 99
   30/99 Example 1: An employee of the Consumer Product Safety Commission
   may accept a discount of $50 on a microwave oven offered by the
   manufacturer to all members of the CPSC employees' association. Even
   though the CPSC is currently conducting studies on the safety of
   microwave ovens, the $50 discount is a standard offer that the
   manufacturer has made broadly available through a number of similar
   organizations to large segments of the public. Example 2: An Assistant
   Secretary may not accept a local country club's offer of membership to
   all members of Department Secretariats which includes a waiver of its
   $5,000 membership initiation fee. Even though the country club is not a
   prohibited source, the offer discriminates in favor of higher ranking
   officials. Example 3: The administrative officer for a district office
   of the Immigration and Naturalization Service has signed an INS order
   to purchase 50 boxes of photocopy paper from a supplier whose
   literature advertises that it will give a free briefcase to anyone who
   purchases 50 or more boxes. Because the paper was purchased with INS
   funds, the administrative officer cannot keep the briefcase which, if
   claimed and received, is Government property. (d) Awards and honorary
   degrees . (1) An employee may accept gifts, other than cash or an
   investment interest, with an aggregate market value of $200 or less if
   such gifts are a bona fide award or incident to a bona fide award that
   is given for meritorious public service or achievement by a person who
   does not have interests that may be substantially affected by the
   performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duties or by
   an association or other organization the majority of whose members do
   not have such interests. Gifts with an aggregate market value in excess
   of $200 and awards of cash or investment interests offered by such
   persons as awards or incidents of awards that are given for these
   purposes may be accepted upon a written determination by an agency
   ethics official that the award is made as part of an established
   program of recognition: (i) Under which awards have been made on a
   regular basis or which is funded, wholly or in part, to ensure its
   continuation on a regular basis; and (ii) Under which selection of
   award recipients is made pursuant to written standards. (2) An employee
   may accept an honorary degree from an institution of higher education
   as defined at 20 U.S.C. 1141(a) based on a written determination by an
   agency ethics official that the timing of the award of the degree would
   not cause a reasonable person to question the employee's impartiality
   in a matter affecting the institution. OGE OGE 15 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 (3)
   An employee who may accept an award or honorary degree pursuant to
   paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section may also accept meals and
   entertainment given to him and to members of his family at the event at
   which the presentation takes place. Example 1: Based on a determination
   by an agency ethics official that the prize meets the criteria set
   forth in § 2635.204(d)(1), an employee of the National Ins titutes of
   Health may accept the Nobel Prize for Medicine, including the cash
   award which accompanies the prize, even though the prize was conferred
   on the basis of laboratory work performed at NIH. Example 2:
   Prestigious University wishes to give an honorary degree to the
   Secretary of Labor. The Secretary may accept the honorary degree only
   if an agency ethics official determines in writing that the timing of
   the award of the degree would not cause a reasonable person to question
   the Secretary's impartiality in a matter affecting the university.
   Example 3: An ambassador selected by a nonprofit organization as
   recipient of its annual award for distinguished service in the interest
   of world peace may, together with his wife, and children, attend the
   awards ceremony dinner and accept a crystal bowl worth $200 presented
   during the ceremony. However, where the organization has also offered
   airline tickets for the ambassador and his family to travel to the city
   where the awards ceremony is to be held, the aggregate value of the
   tickets and the crystal bowl exceeds $200 and he may accept only upon a
   written determination by the agency ethics official that the award is
   made as part of an established program of recognition. (e) Gifts based
   on outside business or employment relationships. An employee may accept
   meals, lodgings, transportation and other benefits: (1) Resulting from
   the business or employment activities of an employee's spouse when it
   is clear that such benefits have not been offered or enhanced because
   of the employee's official position; Example 1: A Department of
   Agriculture employee whose husband is a computer programmer employed by
   an Agriculture Department contractor may attend the company's annual
   retreat for all of its emplo yees and their families held at a resort
   facility. However, under § 2635.502, the employee may be disqualified
   from performing official duties affecting her husband's employer.
   Example 2: Where the spouses of other clerical personnel have not been
   invited, an employee of the Defense Contract Audit Agency whose wife is
   a clerical worker at a defense contractor may not attend the
   contractor's annual retreat in Hawaii for corporate officers and
   members of the board of directors, even though his wife received a
   special invitation for herself and her spouse. OGE OGE 16 9/30/ 9/ 99
   30/99 (2) Resulting from his outside business or employment activities
   when it is clear that such benefits have not been offered or enhanced
   because of his official status; or Example 1: The members of an Army
   Corps of Engineers environmental advisory committee that meets 6 times
   per year are special Government employees. A member who has a
   consulting business may accept an invitation to a $50 dinner from her
   corporate client, an Army construction contractor, unless, for example,
   the invitation was extended in order to discuss the activities of the
   committee. (3) Customarily provided by a prospective employer in
   connection with bona fide employment discussions. If the prospective
   employer has interests that could be affected by performance or
   nonperformance of the employee's duties, acceptance is permitted only
   if the employee first has complied with the disqualification
   requirements of subpart F of this part applicable when seeking
   employment. Example 1: An employee of the Federal Communications
   Commission with responsibility for drafting regulations affecting all
   cable television companies wishes to apply for a job opening with a
   cable television holding company. Once she has properly disqualified
   herself from further work on the regulations as required by subpart F
   of this part, she may enter into employment discussions with the
   company and may accept the company's offer to pay for her airfare,
   hotel and meals in connection with an interview trip. (4) For purposes
   of paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section, employment shall have
   the meaning set forth in § 2635.603(a). (f) Gifts in connection with
   political activities permitted by the Hatch Act Reform Amendments. An
   employee who, in accordance with the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of
   1993, at 5 U.S.C. 7323, may take an active part in political management
   or in political campaigns, may accept meals, lodgings, transportation
   and other benefits, including free attendance at events, when provided,
   in connection with such active participation, by a political
   organization described in 26 U.S.C. 527(e). Any other employee, such as
   a security officer, whose official duties require him to accompany an
   employee to a political event may accept meals, free attendance and
   entertainment provided at the event by such an organization. Example 1:
   The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services may accept
   an airline ticket and hotel accommodations furnished by the campaign
   committee of a candidate for the United States Senate in order to give
   a speech in support of the candidate. (g) Widely attended gatherings
   and other events--(1) Speaking and similar engagements. When an
   employee is assigned to participate as a speaker or panel participant
   or otherwise to present information on behalf of the agency at a
   conference or other event, his acceptance of an offer of free
   attendance at the event on the day of his presentation is permissible
   when provided by OGE OGE 17 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 the sponsor of the event.
   The employee's participation in the event on that day is viewed as a
   customary and necessary part of his performance of the assignment and
   does not involve a gift to him or to the agency. (2) Widely attended
   gatherings. When there has been a determination that his attendance is
   in the interest of the agency because it will further agency programs
   and operations, an employee may accept an unsolicited gift of free
   attendance at all or appropriate parts of a widely attended gathering
   of mutual interest to a number of parties from the sponsor of the event
   or, if more than 100 persons are expected to attend the event and the
   gift of free attendance has a market value of $250 or less, from a
   person other than the sponsor of the event. A gathering is widely
   attended if it is expected that a large number of persons will attend
   and that persons with a diversity of views or interests will be
   present, for example, if it is open to members from throughout the
   interested industry or profession or if those in attendance represent a
   range of persons interested in a given matter. For employees subject to
   a leave system, attendance at the event shall be on the employee's own
   time or, if authorized by the employee's agency, on excused absence
   pursuant to applicable guidelines for granting such absence, or
   otherwise without charge to the employee's leave account. (3)
   Determination of agency interest. The determination of agency interest
   required by paragraph (g)(2) of this section shall be made orally or in
   writing by the agency designee. (i) If the person who has extended the
   invitation has interests that may be substantially affected by the
   performance or nonperformance of an employee's official duties or is an
   association or organization the majority of whose members have such
   interests, the employee's participation may be determined to be in the
   interest of the agency only where there is a written finding by the
   agency designee that the agency's interest in the employee's
   participation in the event outweighs the concern that acceptance of the
   gift of free attendance may or may appear to improperly influence the
   employee in the performance of his official duties. Relevant factors
   that should be considered by the agency designee include the importance
   of the event to the agency, the nature and sensitivity of any pending
   matter affecting the interests of the person who has extended the
   invitation, the significance of the employee's role in any such matter,
   the purpose of the event, the identity of other expected participants
   and the market value of the gift of free attendance. (ii) A blanket
   determination of agency interest may be issued to cover all or any
   category of invitees other than those as to whom the finding is
   required by paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section. Where a finding under
   paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section is required, a written
   determination of agency interest, including the necessary finding, may
   be issued to cover two or more employees whose duties similarly affect
   the interests of the person who has extended the invitation or, where
   that person is an association or organization, of its members. OGE OGE
   18 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 (4) Free attendance . For purposes of paragraphs
   (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, free attendance may include waiver
   of all or part of a conference or other fee or the provision of food,
   refreshments, entertainment, instruction and materials furnished to all
   attendees as an integral part of the event. It does not include travel
   expenses, lodgings, entertainment collateral to the event, or meals
   taken other than in a group setting with all other attendees. Where the
   invitation has been extended to an accompanying spouse or other guest
   (see paragraph (g)(6) of this section), the market value of the gift of
   free attendance includes the market value of free attendance by the
   spouse or other guest as well as the market value of the employee's own
   attendance. Note: There are statutory authorities implemented other
   than by part 2635 under which an agency or an employee may be able to
   accept free attendance or other items not included in the definition of
   free attendance, such as travel expenses. (5) Cost provided by sponsor
   of event. The cost of the employee's attendance will not be considered
   to be provided by the sponsor, and the invitation is not considered to
   be from the sponsor of the event, where a person other than the sponsor
   designates the employee to be invited and bears the cost of the
   employee's attendance through a contribution or other payment intended
   to facilitate that employee's attendance. Payment of dues or a similar
   assessment to a sponsoring organization does not constitute a payment
   intended to facilitate a particular employee's attendance. (6)
   Accompanying spouse or other guest. When others in attendance will
   generally be accompanied by a spouse or other guest, and where the
   invitation is from the same person who has invited the employee, the
   agency designee may authorize an employee to accept an unsolicited
   invitation of free attendance to an accompanying spouse or to another
   accompanying guest to participate in all or a portion of the event at
   which the employee's free attendance is permitted under paragraph
   (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section. The authorization required by this
   paragraph may be provided orally or in writing. Example 1: An aerospace
   industry association that is a prohibited source sponsors an
   industrywide, two-day seminar for which it charges a fee of $400 and
   anticipates attendance of approximately 400. An Air Force contractor
   pays $2,000 to the association so that the association can extend free
   invitations to five Air Force officials designated by the contractor.
   The Air Force officials may not accept the gifts of free attendance.
   Because the contractor specified the invitees and bore the cost of
   their attendance, the gift of free attendance is considered to be
   provided by the company and not by the sponsoring association. Had the
   contractor paid $2,000 to the association in order that the association
   might invite any five Federal employees, an Air Force official to whom
   the sponsoring association extended one of the five invitations could
   attend if his participation were determined to be in the interest of
   the agency. The Air Force official could not in any case accept an
   invitation directly from the nonsponsor contractor because the market
   value of the gift exceeds $250. OGE OGE 19 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 Example 2:
   An employee of the Department of Transportation is invited by a news
   organization to an annual press dinner sponsored by an association of
   press organizations. Tickets for the event cost $250 per person and
   attendance is limited to 400 representatives of press organizations and
   their guests. If the employee's attendance is determined to be in the
   interest of the agency, she may accept the invitation from the news
   organization because more than 100 persons will attend and the cost of
   the ticket does not exceed $250. However, if the invitation were
   extended to the employee and an accompanying guest, her guest could not
   be authorized to attend for free since the market value of the gift of
   free attendance would be $500 and the invitation is from a person other
   than the sponsor of the event. Example 3: An employee of the Department
   of Energy (DOE) and his wife have been invited by a major utility
   executive to a small dinner party. A few other officials of the utility
   and their spouses or other guests are also invited, as is a
   representative of a consumer group concerned with utility rates and her
   husband. The DOE official believes the dinner party will provide him an
   opportunity to socialize with and get to know those in attendance. The
   employee may not accept the free invitation under this exception, even
   if his attendance could be determined to be in the interest of the
   agency. The small dinner party is not a widely attended gathering. Nor
   could the employee be authorized to accept even if the event were
   instead a corporate banquet to which forty company officials and their
   spouses or other guests were invited. In this second case,
   notwithstanding the larger number of persons expected (as opposed to
   the small dinner party just noted) and despite the presence of the
   consumer group representative and her husband who are not officials of
   the utility, those in attendance would still not represent a diversity
   of views or interests. Thus, the company banquet would not qualify as a
   widely attended gathering under those circumstances either. Example 4:
   An employee of the Department of the Treasury authorized to participate
   in a panel discussion of economic issues as part of a one-day
   conference may accept the sponsor's waiver of the conference fee. Under
   the separate authority of § 2635.204(a), he may accept a token of
   appreciation for his speech having a market value of $20 or less.
   Example 5: An Assistant U.S. Attorney is invited to attend a luncheon
   meeting of a local bar association to hear a distinguished judge
   lecture on cross-examining expert witnesses. Although members of the
   bar association are assessed a $15 fee for the meeting, the Assistant
   U.S. Attorney may accept the bar association's offer to attend for
   free, even without a determination of agency interest. The gift can be
   accepted under the $20 de minimis exception at § 2635.204(a). Example
   6: An employee of the Department of the Interior authorized to speak on
   the first day of a four-day conference on endangered species may accept
   the sponsor's waiver of the conference fee for the first day of the
   conference. If the conference is widely attended, he may be authorized,
   based on a determination that his attendance is OGE OGE 20 9/30/ 9/ 99
   30/99 in the agency's interest, to accept the sponsor's offer to waive
   the attendance fee for the remainder of the conference. (h) Social
   invitations from persons other than prohibited sources . An employee
   may accept food, refreshments and entertainment, not including travel
   or lodgings, at a social event attended by several persons where: (1)
   The invitation is from a person who is not a prohibited source; and (2)
   No fee is charged to any person in attendance. Example 1: Along with
   several other Government officials and a number of individuals from the
   private sector, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection
   Agency has been invited to the premier showing of a new adventure movie
   about industrial espionage. The producer is paying all costs of the
   showing. The Administrator may accept the invitation since the producer
   is not a prohibited source and no attendance fee is being charged to
   anyone who has been invited. Example 2: An employee of the White House
   Press Office has been invited to a cocktail party given by a noted
   Washington hostess who is not a prohibited source. The employee may
   attend even though he has only recently been introduced to the hostess
   and suspects that he may have been invited because of his official
   position. (i) Meals, refreshments and entertainment in foreign areas .
   An employee assigned to duty in, or on official travel to, a foreign
   area as defined in 41 CFR 301-7.3(c) may accept food, refreshments or
   entertainment in the course of a breakfast, luncheon, dinner or other
   meeting or event provided: (1) The market value in the foreign area of
   the food, refreshments or entertainment provided at the meeting or
   event, as converted to U.S. dollars, does not exceed the per diem rate
   for the foreign area specified in the U.S. Department of State's
   Maximum Per Diem Allowances for Foreign Areas, Per Diem Supplement
   Section 925 to the Standardized Regulations (GC, FA) available from the
   Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,
   Washington, DC 20402; (2) There is participation in the meeting or
   event by non-U.S. citizens or by representatives of foreign governments
   or other foreign entities; (3) Attendance at the meeting or event is
   part of the employee's official duties to obtain information,
   disseminate information, promote the export of U.S. goods and services,
   represent the United States or otherwise further programs or operations
   of the agency or the U.S. mission in the foreign area; and OGE OGE 21
   9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 (4) The gift of meals, refreshments or entertainment
   is from a person other than a foreign government as defined in 5 U.S.C.
   7342(a)(2). Example 1: A number of local businessmen in a developing
   country are anxious for a U.S. company to locate a manufacturing
   facility in their province. An official of the Overseas Private
   Investment Corporation may accompany the visiting vice president of the
   U.S. company to a dinner meeting hosted by the businessmen at a
   province restaurant where the market value of the food and refreshments
   does not exceed the per diem rate for that country. (j) Gifts to the
   President or Vice President. Because of considerations relating to the
   conduct of their offices, including those of protocol and etiquette,
   the President or the Vice President may accept any gift on his own
   behalf or on behalf of any family member, provided that such acceptance
   does not violate § 2635.202(c) (1) or (2), 18 U.S.C. 201(b) or
   201(c)(3), or the Constitution of the United States. (k) Gifts
   authorized by supplemental agency regulation. An employee may accept
   any gift the acceptance of which is specifically authorized by a
   supplemental agency regulation. (l) Gifts accepted under specific
   statutory authority. The prohibitions on acceptance of gifts from
   outside sources contained in this subpart do not apply to any item,
   receipt of which is specifically authorized by statute. Gifts which may
   be received by an employee under the authority of specific statutes
   include, but are not limited to: (1) Free attendance, course or meeting
   materials, transportation, lodgings, food and refreshments or
   reimbursements therefor incident to training or meetings when accepted
   by the employee under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 4111 from an
   organization with tax-exempt status under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) or from a
   person to whom the prohibitions in 18 U.S.C. 209 do not apply. The
   employee's acceptance must be approved by the agency in accordance with
   part 410 of this title; or Note: 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) is authority for
   tax-exempt treatment of a limited class of nonprofit organizations,
   including those organized and operated for charitable, religious or
   educational purposes. Many nonprofit organizations are not exempt from
   taxation under this section. (2) Gifts from a foreign government or
   international or multinational organization, or its representative,
   when accepted by the employee under the authority of the Foreign Gifts
   and Decorations Act, 5 U.S.C. 7342. As a condition of acceptance, an
   employee must comply with requirements imposed by the agency's
   regulations or procedures implementing that Act. OGE OGE 22 9/30/ 9/ 99
   30/99 § 2635.205 Proper disposition of prohibited gifts. (a) An
   employee who has received a gift that cannot be accepted under this
   subpart shall, unless the gift is accepted by an agency acting under
   specific statutory authority: (1) Return any tangible item to the donor
   or pay the donor its market value. An employee who cannot ascertain the
   actual market value of an item may estimate its market value by
   reference to the retail cost of similar items of like quality. See §
   2635.203(c). Example 1: To avoid public embarrassment to the seminar
   sponsor, an employee of the National Park Service did not decline a
   barometer worth $200 given at the conclusion of his speech on Federal
   lands policy. The employee must either return the barometer or promptly
   reimburse the sponsor $200. (2) When it is not practical to return a
   tangible item because it is perishable, the item may, at the discretion
   of the employee's supervisor or an agency ethics official, be given to
   an appropriate charity, shared within the recipient's office, or
   destroyed. Example 1: With approval by the recipient's supervisor, a
   floral arrangement sent by a disability claimant to a helpful employee
   of the Social Security Administration may be placed in the office's
   reception area. (3) For any entertainment, favor, service, benefit or
   other intangible, reimburse the donor the market value. Subsequent
   reciprocation by the employee does not constitute reimbursement.
   Example 1: A Department of Defense employee wishes to attend a
   charitable event to which he has been offered a $300 ticket by a
   prohibited source. Although his attendance is not in the interest of
   the agency under § 2635.204(g), he may attend if he reimburses the
   donor the $300 face value of the ticket. (4) Dispose of gifts from
   foreign governments or international organizations in accordance with
   41 CFR part 101-49, and dispose of materials received in conjunction
   with official travel in accordance with 41 CFR 101-25.103. (b) An
   agency may authorize disposition or return of gifts at Government
   expense. Employees may use penalty mail to forward reimbursements
   required or permitted by this section. (c) An employee who, on his own
   initiative, promptly complies with the requirements of this section
   will not be deemed to have improperly accepted an unsolicited gift. An
   employee who promptly consults his agency ethics official to determine
   whether acceptance of an unsolicited gift is proper and who, upon the
   advice of the ethics official, returns the gift or otherwise disposes
   of the gift in accordance with this section, will be considered to have
   complied with the requirements of this section on his own initiative.
   OGE OGE 23 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 SUBPART C - GIFTS BETWEEN EMPLOYEES §
   2635.301 Overview. This subpart contains standards that prohibit an
   employee from giving, donating to, or soliciting contributions for, a
   gift to an official superior and from accepting a gift from an employee
   receiving less pay than himself, unless the item is excluded from the
   definition of a gift or falls within one of the exceptions set forth in
   this subpart. § 2635.302 General standards. (a) Gifts to superiors.
   Except as provided in this subpart, an employee may not: (1) Directly
   or indirectly, give a gift to or make a donation toward a gift for an
   official superior; or (2) Solicit a contribution from another employee
   for a gift to either his own or the other employee's official superior.
   (b) Gifts from employees receiving less pay. Except as provided in this
   subpart, an employee may not, directly or indirectly, accept a gift
   from an employee receiving less pay than himself unless: (1) The two
   employees are not in a subordinate-official superior relationship; and
   (2) There is a personal relationship between the two employees that
   would justify the gift. (c) Limitation on use of exceptions.
   Notwithstanding any exception provided in this subpart, an official
   superior shall not coerce the offering of a gift from a subordinate. §
   2635.303 Definitions. For purposes of this subpart, the following
   definitions shall apply: (a) Gift has the meaning set forth in §
   2635.203(b). For purposes of that definition an employee will be deemed
   to have paid market value for any benefit received as a result of his
   participation in any carpool or other such mutual arrangement involving
   another employee or other employees if he bears his fair proportion of
   the expense or effort involved. (b) Indirectly, for purposes of §
   2635.302(b), has the meaning set forth in § 2635.203(f). For purposes
   of § 2635.302(a), it includes a gift: OGE OGE 24 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 (1)
   Given with the employee's knowledge and acquiescence by his parent,
   sibling, spouse, child, or dependent relative; or (2) Given by a person
   other than the employee under circumstances where the employee has
   promised or agreed to reimburse that person or to give that person
   something of value in exchange for giving the gift. (c) Subject to
   paragraph (a) of this section, market value has the meaning set forth
   in § 2635.203(c). (d) Official superior means any other employee, other
   than the President and the Vice President, including but not limited to
   an immediate supervisor, whose official responsibilities include
   directing or evaluating the performance of the employee's official
   duties or those of any other official superior of the employee. For
   purposes of this subpart, an employee is considered to be the
   subordinate of any of his official superiors. (e) Solicit means to
   request contributions by personal communication or by general
   announcement. (f) Voluntary contribution means a contribution given
   freely, without pressure or coercion. A contribution is not voluntary
   unless it is made in an amount determined by the contributing employee,
   except that where an amount for a gift is included in the cost for a
   luncheon, reception or similar event, an employee who freely chooses to
   pay a proportionate share of the total cost in order to attend will be
   deemed to have made a voluntary contribution. Except in the case of
   contributions for a gift included in the cost of a luncheon, reception
   or similar event, a statement that an employee may choose to contribute
   less or not at all shall accompany any recommendation of an amount to
   be contributed for a gift to an official superior. Example 1: A
   supervisory employee of the Agency for International Development has
   just been reassigned from Washington, DC to Kabul, Afghanistan. As a
   farewell party, 12 of her subordinates have decided to take her out to
   lunch at the Khyber Repast. It is understood that each will pay for his
   own meal and that the cost of the supervisor's lunch will be divided
   equally among the twelve. Even though the amount they will contribute
   is not determined until the supervisor orders lunch, the contribution
   made by those who choose to participate in the farewell lunch is
   voluntary. § 2635.304 Exceptions. The prohibitions set forth in §
   2635.302(a) and (b) do not apply to a gift given or accepted under the
   circumstances described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. A
   contribution or the solicitation of a contribution that would otherwise
   violate the prohibitions set forth in § 2635.302(a) and (b) may only be
   made in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. OGE OGE 25 9/30/
   9/ 99 30/99 (a) General exceptions. On an occasional basis, including
   any occasion on which gifts are traditionally given or exchanged, the
   following may be given to an official superior or accepted from a
   subordinate or other employee receiving less pay: (1) Items, other than
   cash, with an aggregate market value of $10 or less per occasion; (2)
   Items such as food and refreshments to be shared in the office among
   several employees; (3) Personal hospitality provided at a residence
   which is of a type and value customarily provided by the employee to
   personal friends; (4) Items given in connection with the receipt of
   personal hospitality if of a type and value customarily given on such
   occasions; and (5) Leave transferred under subpart I of part 630 of
   this title to an employee who is not an immediate supervisor, unless
   obtained in violation of § 630.912 of this title. Example 1: Upon
   returning to work following a vacation at the beach, a claims examiner
   with the Department of Veterans Affairs may give his supervisor, and
   his supervisor may accept, a bag of saltwater taffy purchased on the
   boardwalk for $8. Example 2: An employee of the Federal Deposit
   Insurance Corporation whose bank examination responsibilities require
   frequent travel may not bring her supervisor, and her supervisor may
   not accept, souvenir coffee mugs from each of the cities she visits in
   the course of performing her duties, even though each of the mugs costs
   less than $5. Gifts given on this basis are not occasional. Example 3:
   The Secretary of Labor has invited the agency's General Counsel to a
   dinner party at his home. The General Counsel may bring a $15 bottle of
   wine to the dinner party and the Secretary may accept this customary
   hostess gift from his subordinate, even though its cost is in excess of
   $10. Example 4: For Christmas, a secretary may give his supervisor, and
   the supervisor may accept, a poinsettia plant purchased for $10 or
   less. The secretary may also invite his supervisor to a Christmas party
   in his home and the supervisor may attend. (b) Special, infrequent
   occasions. A gift appropriate to the occasion may be given to an
   official superior or accepted from a subordinate or other employee
   receiving less pay: (1) In recognition of infrequently occurring
   occasions of personal significance such as marriage, illness, or the
   birth or adoption of a child; or (2) Upon occasions that terminate a
   subordinate-official superior relationship, such as retirement,
   resignation, or transfer. OGE OGE 26 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99 Example 1: The
   administrative assistant to the personnel director of the Tennessee
   Valley Authority may send a $30 floral arrangement to the personnel
   director who is in the hospital recovering from surgery. The personnel
   director may accept the gift. Example 2: A chemist employed by the Food
   and Drug Administration has been invited to the wedding of the lab
   director who is his official superior. He may give the lab director and
   his bride, and they may accept, a place setting in the couple's
   selected china pattern purchased for $70. Example 3: Upon the occasion
   of the supervisor's retirement from Federal service, an employee of the
   Fish and Wildlife Service may give her supervisor a book of wildlife
   photographs which she purchased for $19. The retiring supervisor may
   accept the book. (c) Voluntary contributions. An employee may solicit
   voluntary contributions of nominal amounts from fellow employees for an
   appropriate gift to an official superior and an employee may make a
   voluntary contribution of a nominal amount to an appropriate gift to an
   official superior: (1) On a special, infrequent occasion as described
   in paragraph (b) of this section; or (2) On an occasional basis, for
   items such as food and refreshments to be shared in the office among
   several employees. An employee may accept such gifts to which a
   subordinate or other employee receiving less pay than himself has
   contributed. Example 1: To mark the occasion of his retirement, members
   of the immediate staff of the Under Secretary of the Army would like to
   give him a party and provide him with a gift certificate. They may
   distribute an announcement of the party and include a nominal amount
   for a retirement gift in the fee for the party. Example 2: The General
   Counsel of the National Endowment for the Arts may not collect
   contributions for a Christmas gift for the Chairman. Christmas occurs
   annually and is not an occasion of personal significance. Example 3:
   Subordinates may not take up a collection for a gift to an official
   superior on the occasion of the superior's swearing in or promotion to
   a higher grade position within the supervisory chain of that
   organization. These are not events that mark the termination of the
   subordinate-official superior relationship, nor are they events of
   personal significance within the meaning of § 2635.304(b). However,
   subordinates may take up a collection and employees may contribute $3
   each to buy refreshments to be consumed by everyone in the immediate
   office to mark either such occasion. OGE OGE 27 9/30/ 9/ 99 30/99
   Example 4: Subordinates may each contribute a nominal amount to a fund
   to give a gift to an official superior upon the occasion of that
   superior's transfer or promotion to a position outside the
   organization. Example 5: An Assistant Secretary at the Department of
   the Interior is getting married. His secretary has decided that a
   microwave oven would be a nice gift from his staff and has informed
   each of the Assistant Secretary's subordinates that they should
   contribute $5 for the gift. Her method of collection is improper.
   Although she may recommend a $5 contribution, the recommendation must
   be coupled with a statement that the employee whose contribution is
   solicited is free to contribute less or nothing at all. OGE
