                                 About ETDE

   ETDE, through its member countries, provides an extensive bibliographic
   database announcing published energy research and technology
   information. As an IEA Implementing Agreement, ETDE has four objectives
   regarding topics in energy research and technology. These objectives
   are to
     * Collect and exchange energy research and technology information
       through the creation and maintenance of a common database.
     * Disseminate and promote the energy research and technology
       information managed by the Exchange
     * Support IEA's strategic priorities and initiatives relevant to
       energy technology and R&D collaboration.
     * Collaborate with other providers of energy research and technology
       information in order to avoid duplication of efforts.

   The ETDE program began in 1987 with 11 countries and now has 18 member
   countries. As with all IEA programmes, ETDE functions through
   Contracting Parties designated by the government of each ETDE member
   countryand an Operating Agent (OA). The Contracting Parties ensure that
   the energy information published within their national borders is
   announced in ETDE's Energy Database. Each Contracting Party assigns
   delegates to representative them on ETDE's Executive Committee and
   Technical Working Group. The Executive Committee sets policy for the
   Exchange and oversees budgetary matters. The Technical Working Group
   oversees the technical aspects of maintaining and improving ETDE's
   Energy Database.

   ETDE's OA, the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Scientific and
   Technical Information, acts on behalf of the Contracting Parties.
   Located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA, the OA handles the daily tasks
   that keep the Exchange functioning smoothly, including the following:
     * receiving and processing data submitted by member countries
     * providing quality assurance and semi-monthly database updates to
       members
     * providing member support and training
     * implementing Executive Committee decisions
     * facilitating projects of the Technical Working Group
     * publishing authorities and standards for the Energy Database
     * maintaining financial records and projections
     * serving as liaison with collaborating agencies
     * preparing a quarterly newsletter, annual report, statistics, and
       other marketing materials
