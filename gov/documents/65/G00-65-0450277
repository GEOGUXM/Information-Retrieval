   Scientist tests super-slick coating.

   SLICK 101 -- Argonne National Laboratory scientist Ali Erdemir observes
   a sample of a new coating that is 40 times slicker than Teflon. The new
   material has sparked tremendous interest from industry. Argonne

   Magnetic process recovers recyclable metals from solutions.

   ZAPPING WASTE -- Chemist Luis Nunez demonstrates the magnetic appeal of
   his technique for cleaning up industrial waste streams. The specially
   treated particles are attracted to the magnet, allowing waste metals to
   be recovered and recycled. Argonne National Laboratory photo.

   Scientist tests water with new process.

   SHORTCUT TO CLEAN -- Environmental scientists test water at Argonne
   using an innovative process developed with 3M and IBC Advanced
   Technologies. The technology eliminates up to 90 percent of the steps
   previously needed to test water at DOE sites and nuclearpower plants.
