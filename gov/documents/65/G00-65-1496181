   IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
   CIRCUIT _________________________________ Nos. 00-5212, 5213
   _________________________________ MICROSOFT CORPORATION,
   Defendant-Appellant, v. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and STATE OF NEW YORK,
   et al., Plaintiffs-Appellees. _________________________________ REPLY
   OF AMERICA ONLINE, INC., IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PARTICIPATE
   AS AMICUS CURIAE _________________________________ America Online, Inc.
   ("AOL") respectfully submits this Reply to Appellant Microsoft
   Corporation's ("Microsoft") Response to AOL's Motion for Leave to
   Participate as Amicus Curiae. As noted in AOL's initial filing, the
   United States and the State parties have consented to AOL's
   participation as an amicus. They continue to do so in their Response,
   appropriately citing "the importance of th[is] case." Appellees' Joint
   Response at 1. Microsoft, on the other hand, opposes AOL's
   participation as amicus on the ground that "it would be totally
   improper for AOL to attempt to supplement [its] testimony [at trial]
   with additional facts outside the record." Microsoft Response ("MR") at
   3. The Court might reasonably wonder why Microsoft assumes that any
   submission by AOL would attempt to "supplement" the record. The answer,
   we respectfully submit, lies in Microsoft's evident worry about how
   AOL's participation as amicus in this case would assist the Court.
   While we, of course, do not intend to attempt to supplement the
   evidence on appeal, we do believe AOL's unique Internet expertise and
   involvement in Microsoft's conduct that is the subject matter of this
   case will enable AOL to assist the Court in evaluating the broader
   perspective of what is at issue in this very important case.
   Specifically, AOL is uniquely positioned to respond to the arguments
   repeatedly raised by Microsoft throughout this case that the conduct
   found by the District Court is, in any event, simply a matter of the
   past that does not justify the imposition of an effective
   forward-looking remedy. We believe that AOL's perspective, as a leader
   in the development of the Internet and the owner of Netscape, would be
   an important contribution to this Court's evaluation of the
   appropriateness of the District Court's judgment and remedy. That is
   not "supplement[ing]" the record, as Microsoft attempts pejoratively to
   describe it; rather it is providing the Court with a valuable
   perspective for evaluating the District Court's judgment and remedy.
   Nor is there any basis to support Microsoft's suggestion that the Court
   deviate from its well- established amicus rules and impose a special
   one-brief limit, above and beyond the limits already contained in
   Circuit Rule 29(d) and the October 11 scheduling order. AOL recognizes
   that other prospective amici bring to the case other, different
   valuable perspectives and insights.1 Counsel for 1 Microsoft suggests
   that amicus participation in this case should be subject to special
   limitations because some of the prospective amici are also its business
   competitors. See, e.g., MR at 3. But an entity's status as a competitor
   of one of the principal parties has never been considered a barrier to
   amicus participation. Indeed, in a case (such as this one) that is of
   substantial importance to entire sectors of the national economy, a
   rule excluding would-be amici solely on the grounds that 2 AOL are
   mindful of their obligations under Circuit Rule 29(d) and the October
   11 order, and will file a separate brief only if there is a
   counsel-certifiable need for a separate filing. In short, the amicus
   rules already in place will ensure that amicus participation by AOL
   (and any other entities) is neither "unfair to Microsoft [nor]
   burdensome to the Court." MR at 2. Accordingly, AOL respectfully asks
   that the Court grant its motion for leave to participate as an amicus
   curiae, without special limitations beyond those already reflected in
   Circuit Rule 29(d) and the October 11 Order. Respectfully submitted,
