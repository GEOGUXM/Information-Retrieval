XSLToolbox

   The XSLToolbox is a collection of tools whose purpose is to make it
   easier for XML (Extensible Markup Language) applications to talk to one
   another. This collection currently includes APEX, an application for
   transforming XML documents as specified by architectural forms, and
   ATTS, a stylesheet generator for adding default attribute values to XML
   documents. The XSLToolbox is so named because it reduces the need for
   XML developers to write XSLT (Extensible Style Language
   Transformations). The tools themselves happen to be written in XSLT as
   well.

   Additional information is available on the following pages:

   The XSLToolbox is produced by NIST's Manufacturing Systems Integration
   Division.

What's New

   08 August 2001
          Added to the distribution an example using APEX and ATTS
          together with RELAX NG to mimic some of the functionality of W3C
          XML Schema.

   01 August 2001
          Added to the documentation a paper (to be presented at the
          August Extreme Markup Languages conference) discussing
          architectural forms, XSLT, and APEX.

   22 June 2001
          ATTS now handles context-sensitive elements.
