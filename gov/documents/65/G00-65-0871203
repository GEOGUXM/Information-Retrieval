              ACD CHEMISTS EXCEL IN INTERNATIONAL WINE TESTING!

   Clean Room Photo Karen Murphy and her colleagues in the Analytical
   Chemistry Division of CSTL, recently demonstrated that measurements of
   lead in wine made at NIST are among the most accurate in the world.
   NIST was one of 14 National Measurement Institutes participating in an
   international pilot study of how accurately the official national
   standards agencies measure lead in wine.
