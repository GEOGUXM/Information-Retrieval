                          The Office of Minority Health (OMH) was created by the
   U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 1985 as a result
   of the Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority
   Health. Under the direction of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for
   Minority Health, OMH advises the Secretary and the Office of Public
   Health and Science (OPHS) on public health issues affecting American
   Indians and Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Other
   Pacific Islanders, Blacks/African Americans, and Hispanics/Latinos.

   The mission of OMH is to improve the health of racial and ethnic
   populations through the development of effective health policies and
   programs that help to eliminate disparities in health.

   OMH works closely with sister agencies within HHS and their minority
   health representatives. Regional minority health consultants serve as
   OMH representatives in the 10 HHS regional offices. OMH works closely
   with established State offices of minority health, and provides
   technical assistance, as requested, to minority community groups
   seeking to establish similar entities within their states.

   OMH has a role in the development and coordination of Federal health
   policy by addressing minority health concerns and making progress to
   eliminate health disparities. OMH helps to ensure that Federal, State,
   and local health programs take into account the needs of disadvantaged
   and racial and ethnic populations, including their specific and
   cultural characteristics.

   Together with HHS operating divisions and other Federal departments,
   OMH works to improve collection and analyses of data on the health of
   racial and ethnic populations. OMH also monitors efforts to achieve the
   goals of Healthy People 2010, which has a special focus on eliminating,
   and not merely reducing, racial and ethnic disparities in health.

   OMH has taken an active role in implementing the HHS Initiative to
   Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health. In February 1998,
   the President announced this initiative as part of his Initiative on
   Race, in an effort to make the elimination of disparities in health
   outcomes for racial and ethnic minorities in this country a national
   priority. Congress made an important investment towards the goal of
   eliminating disparities by approving funding for the Initiative.

   As part of this initiative, OMH works with, and provides support to the
   Surgeon General and the Assistant Secretary for Planning and
   Evaluation; helped to identify health focus areas for the Department's
   Initiative; serves on the six health focus area workgroups, and the
   data workgroup; has taken over the administration of the Race and
   Health Web site; and collaborates with the Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention on the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health
   grants.

   OMH coordinates HHS' efforts to implement other selected White House
   Initiatives, and sponsors initiatives of its own. Currently in effect
   are the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and
   Universities (HBCU), the Hispanic Agenda for Action (HAA), the White
   House Initiative on Tribal Colleges and Universities, and the Asian
   American and Pacific Islander Action Agenda.

   OMH cooperative agreements and grants help launch research and
   demonstration projects. Multi- project cooperative agreements are
   regularly funded both by OMH and other partners within HHS.

   OMH administers grant programs in an effort to facilitate community
   linkages and strategies that use scarce resources efficiently and
   across organizational lines. Grant programs include Minority Community
   Health Coalition Demonstration Grants, the Bilingual/Bicultural Service
   Demonstration Grants, and the Information Technology Infrastructure
   Grant Program.

   With funds from the HHS-Congressional Black Caucus HIV Initiative, OMH
   is expanding its activities related to HIV/AIDS. OMH now operates
   several programs related to minorities and HIV/AIDS. These programs
   include the Minority Community Health Coalition Demonstration Program,
   HIV/AIDS; the Technical Assistance and Capacity Development
   Demonstration Program for HIV/AIDS-Related Services in Highly Impacted
   Minority Communities; the State and Territorial Minority HIV/AIDS
   Demonstration Grant Program; and OMH supports AIDS-related projects
   under 18 umbrella cooperative agreements.

   In 1987, OMH established the Office of Minority Health Resource Center
   (OMHRC) to meet the public's need for reliable, accurate, and timely
   information and technical assistance on issues affecting the health of
   minority populations. Since that time, OMHRC has grown to become one of
   the nation's largest sources of minority health information.

   Some of OMHRC's services include referrals, publications, reference
   information, and access to its resource person's network -- a database
   of minority health professionals from across the country. OMHRC
   publishes a newsletter, Closing the Gap, which reports on Federal,
   State, and community-based activities related to minority health. Each
   newsletter covers a different health topic, and is available for free
   in both print and electronic versions.

   In addition, new staff has been added to the OMHRC to take on
   additional projects including developing Web pages specific to HIV/AIDS
   with a focus on funding information; expanding the database and
   library; building the capability of the Resource Person's Network with
   experts in the field of HIV/AIDS who will provide technical assistance
   to the community; publishing four additional issues of Closing the Gap
   on HIV/AIDS-related topics; and increasing treatment and prevention
   messages related to HIV/AIDS. The Resource Center is adding staff
   dedicated to answering the public's questions about HIV/AIDS.

   Please browse the OMH Web site for information on minority health
   issues, funding opportunities, conferences, legislative action in
   Congress, publications, useful information links, and other
   information. If you need further assistance, please call the OMHRC at
   (800) 444-6472. All services of the center are free of charge and
   Spanish-speaking information specialists are available. TDD for the
   hearing impaired is available at (301) 230-7199.
