   Internet and CD-ROMs. The following electronic products for compliance
   assistance are available:
     * eTools
     * Technical Links
     * PowerPoint Presentations

electronic Compliance Assistance Tools (eCATs) and Expert Systems

eTools

   eTools are "stand-alone", interactive, Web-based training tools on
   occupational safety and health topics. They are highly illustrated and
   utilize graphical menus as well as expert system modules.  These
   modules enable the user to answer questions, and receive reliable
   advice on how OSHA regulations apply to their work site.

   eCATs and Expert Advisors are older products.  eCATs do not include
   expert systems but are fully illustrated.  Expert Advisors are based
   solely on expert systems.

   eTools, eCATs and min-eCATs are available as downloadable files for
   off-line use.
