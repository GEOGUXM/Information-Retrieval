     Although IWMD operates the landfills, your trash is picked up by
   private companies.

     IWMD also manages Household Hazardous Waste Collection Centers
   (HHWCC), which provide a free drop-off service for household wastes
   which cannot be disposed of in your regular trash, such as motor oils,
   paints, herbicides, etc.
