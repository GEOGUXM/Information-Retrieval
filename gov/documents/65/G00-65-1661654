      The electronic tour is the creation of seventh- and eighth-grade
    students from Washington Middle School in Olympia, Washington, under
   the direction of the Capitol Visitor Services program at the Department
    of General Administration. It was created during the 2000-2001 school
    year as a community service project for the schools Generation www.Y
       program. The program, funded by a U.S. Department of Education
      Technology Innovation Challenge Grant, teaches students computer
      skills, which they use to assist teachers to develop and present
   curriculum. The Olympia School District was the first in the country to
    receive the grant. The program partners students and teachers to help
                     integrate technology into learning.

     Created by students for students, the tour is an excellent teaching
    tool for visitors of all ages. Thank you for coming. Enjoy the tour.
