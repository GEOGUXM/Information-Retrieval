                         Sen. Clinton Press Release

                              January 23, 2002

                  Senator Clinton Hails New Tax Relief Bill
                          for WTC Widows, Families

              World Trade Center Victims' Families Will Receive
                         Tax Relief For 2000 & 2001

   Washington, DC - Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (NY) today praised
   President Bush for signing the "Victims of Terrorism Tax Relief Act"
   into law and said the measure "will help ease some of the financial
   burdens faced by families who lost loved ones on September 11."

   Senator Clinton worked with her colleagues, Senators Robert Torricelli,
   Jon Corzine and Charles E. Schumer, to pass the legislation before
   Christmas. The new law will exempt the families of victims of the
   September 11 terrorist attacks from income taxes for the 2000 and 2001
   tax years and provide other tax relief.

   "I have met with widows and other family members who lost sons and
   daughters, brothers and sisters, and parents on September 11. Their
   grief is enormous and nothing can fully make up for the pain they are
   feeling, especially in his holiday season," Senator Clinton said. "But
   by providing this tax relief, we can help the families pay their bills
   and meet other needs at a time when they need it most."

   "Many families lost financial security on September 11. They lost what
   they've been planning and saving for, and counting on," Senator Clinton
   said. "When a member of the military loses his or her life in the line
   of duty, or a government employee dies as the result of a terrorist
   attack outside of the United States, their families are exempted from
   paying income tax. The men and women who lost their lives on Sept. 11
   were on the front-lines in our war against terrorism here at home, and
   it is important that we give them the recognition and the honor that
   they deserve." Senator Clinton said that waiving tax liability will be
   especially helpful to families who lost all their financial records in
   the collapse of the World Trade Center.

   The "Victims of Terrorism Tax Relief Act of 2001" will extend tax
   relief to families of persons who were killed as a result of the
   September 11 terrorist attacks. Additionally, victims of the bombing of
   the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City on April 19,
   1995 and the victims of the post-September 11 anthrax attacks are
   eligible for this relief.

   In addition to refunding income taxes for 2000 and 2001, the
   legislation provides a minimum $10,000 rebate to the families of
   victims who did not make enough money to pay income tax. The bill also
   shields the first $3 million in assets from federal and state estate
   tax and $8.5 million in assets from federal estate tax for 2001. In
   addition, the bill protects families from taxation on death benefits,
   charitable contributions and debt forgiveness.

   "In the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks on our
   country, we pledged to do whatever it took to support and aid the
   victims and their families. An important part of this is ensuring that
   those who have endured so much pain are not forced to suffer financial
   hardship as well," Senator Clinton said. "I am pleased that the
   President has signed this legislation into law today. It will help make
   sure that these families, who have been through so much, receive the
   financial relief that they need."
