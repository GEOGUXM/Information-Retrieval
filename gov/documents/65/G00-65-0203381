   5/98 COLLAGEN CONTENT FROM HYDROXYPROLINE Sample Preparation 1. Place
   1.6  3.5 g of powdered frozen sample in an aluminum weigh pan. Record
   weight. Place in a 110° C oven and dry sample for 30 min. Weigh and
   record dry sample weight. For uncooked samples, place 6 g of sample in
   weigh pan , record weights and heat in 110° C oven for 1.5 hr. 2. Using
   a mortar and pestle, grind sample to a fine powder. 3. Weigh 300 mg
   sample (record exact sample weight) and transfer to a 100 ml serum
   vial. Add 50 ml 6N HCl. 4. Seal vials with a rubber stopper and
   aluminum tear-away seal. Purge with dry nitrogen gas for 10 minutes.
   For exhaust, a disposable 20 gauge needle inserted off center in the
   stopper. For nitrogen purge, a 4" 20 gauge needle is inserted in the
   center of the stopper and pushed almost to the bottom of the vial.
   After 10 min nitrogen purge, first remove the nitrogen purge needle and
   then the exhaust needle. 5. Place vials in a pan and place the pan in a
   110°C oven and heat for 20 hours. 6. Remove the pan of vials and allow
   the samples to cool 30 min. Because pressure can build up in the vial,
   hold thumb over stopper as you are peeling the seal and ease the
   stopper out of the vial, releasing the pressure gradually. 7. Using
   Whatman 54 paper, 12.5 cm, filter sample quantitatively into a 100 ml
   volumetric flask. Rinse the vial, lip of the vial, filter paper and
   then the funnel to obtain all the sample. Bring to volume with water
   and mix thoroughly. 8. Remove 50 ml and place into a 500 ml evaporating
   flask. Evaporate to dryness at 60°C in a vacuum rotary evaporator.
   After the sample dries down, rinse the flask with water to rehydrate
   the sample and then evaporate to dryness again. 9. Quantitatively
   transfer sample to a 50 ml volumetric flask using sodium diluent. To
   transfer the dried sample from the flask, use a Pasteur pipette and add
   diluent to flask. Swirl the flask to dissolve all the sample. Transfer
   to a 50 ml Nalgene beaker. Rinse flask several times. Transfer beaker
   contents to 50 ml volumetric, and then rinse beaker several times with
   diluent. Bring 50 ml volumetric flask to volume with diluent. Mix well.
   1 5/98 10. Transfer sample to a 20 ml scintillation vial. Using a 3 ml
   Luer-lok syringe draw up sample. Filter sample through a 13 mm Swinney
   filter fitted with a 0.2 µm, Gelman Supor 200 membrane filter into a
   disposable glass tube. The remaining sample in the scintillation vial
   may be frozen for future re-runs. HPLC Sample Prep To a 2.0 ml HPLC
   vial add: 500 µl filtered sample 28 µl 2.5 µM Cysteic acid (Injected
   amount = 1 µg) HPLC Analysis Separation of amino acids is by
   ion-exchange chromatography and photometric detection of post-column
   derivatives of primary amines and ninhydrin. 1. Inject 50 µl of sample
   automatically into the Spectra Physics HPLC system, using SP8800 pump,
   and SP8880 autosampler. a. Column: 3mm x 250mm, 10 µm cation exchange
   resin, Na form, Pickering # 1193250 b. Flow rate: 0.4 ml/min c. Run
   Time: 40 min d. Column Temperature: 54°C e. Gradient elution buffer:
   Sodium Eluent 2.70 (ChromTech #Na270) and Regenerant (Pickering PN
   RG011) f. Spectra FOCUS - Forward Optical Scanning Detector; set at 440
   nm wavelength g. Used Trione (ninhydrin) color reagent (ChromTech
   #T200) 2. Calculations performed by SpectraSYSTEM software PC1000. The
   hydroxyproline content (ng) is calculated from the standard curve, the
   hydroxyproline area, and adjustment for cysteic acid area deviation
   from expectation. This value is plugged into an equation to account for
   both sample dilution during analysis and the amount of hydroxyproline
   in the collagen of muscle (Goll et al., 1963; Woessner, 1961) to give
   mg of collagen per g cooked muscle. 2 5/98 Reagents 1. Sodium Diluent,
   pH 2.20 Beckman P/N 239440; [Na+] = 0.27 N 2. Sodium Eluent, pH 2.70
   ChromTech P/N Na270 3. Trione/two part ChromTech P/N T120C Solutions 1.
   6 N Hydrochloric Acid Add approximately 700 ml water to 2 liter
   volumetric flask. Slowly add 990 ml concentrated HCl. Bring to volume
   and store at room temperature. 2. 2.5 µM Cysteic Acid in 0.1 N HCl
   0.0189 g/50 ml 0.1 N HCl. Store refrigerated. Standard Curve Use
   trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline, Sigma Ultra. Make a 1mg/ml solution with
   sodium diluent. The cysteic acid is used to adjust for instrumentation
   variation. Hydroxyproline 2.5µM Cysteic Acid Na Diluent 125 ng 2.5 µl
