The U.S. and the Organization of American States

   What is the OAS?

   The Organization of American States, the oldest regional international
   organization in the world, traces its origins to the Congress of
   Panama, convoked by Simon Bolivar in 1826 and attended by
   representatives from Central and South America. That congress drafted
   the Treaty of Perpetual Union, League and Confederation, signed by the
   delegates but ratified only by Gran Colombia (today's Colombia,
   Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela).  Roger Francisco Noriega is the U.S.
   Permanent Representative to the OAS.
