Recycled Content Certification

About recycled content

   In 1989 the Legislature enacted statutes to encourage State agencies to
   purchase products with recycled content. In 1993, the Public Contract
   Code was amended to require the California Integrated Waste Management
   Board and the Department of General Services to work together in
   developing and implementing the State Agency Buy Recycled Campaign to
   provide the tools needed to reach the recycled content products
   purchasing goals.

   The Prison Industry Authority supports these efforts to become more
   responsible for our environment. We are evaluating our products to
   certify their recycled content. In addition, we are looking at our
   manufacturing methods and raw materials purchases to help increase
   their recycled content. As the Prison Industry Authority is able to
   improve its manufacturing methods, we will be increasing the recycled
   content of our products. Lastly, the Prison Industry Authority is
   taking a careful look at our internal operations in order to become
   more "green".

   Information about the recycled content of the Prison Industry
   Authority's products is available on the Internet in this central
   location. You can search for specific products by two methods, the
   product's "core number" or by the product description. In addition, the
   products with certified recycled content will have the Prison Industry
   Authority's recycled content logo in the electronic catalog's product
   pages. Just click on the logo and the recycled content certificate will
   appear.

   Because we have about 1350 manufactured products, it will take some
   time to complete the initial recycled content certification process. As
   we improve our manufacturing to become more "green", the recycled
   content of our products will be improved. Continue to check this
   portion of PIA's web site and our improvements.

   If you need a recycled content certification that is not currently
   available online, please contact Customer Service at (916) 358-2727. We
   are here to serve you.
