  Coping Tips
   __________________________________________________________________

   You have recently been exposed to a traumatic event. Even though the
   event may be over, you may experience some emotional or physical
   reactions. This is very common and quite normal. The following are some
   tips that can help you cope.

     * Take a walk or exercise.
     * Go to a movie or rent a video.
     * Talk to a family member, friend or neighbor. Talking is the best
       medicine.
     * Read a book.
     * Take a nap.
     * Decrease your alcohol consumption.
     * Maintain a good diet.
     * Make time for leisure activities.
     * Get plenty of sleep.
     * Soak in a hot bath.
     * Express your feelings about the event to a priest, rabbi or pastor.
     * Cook a hot meal.
     * Try to return to a normal routine as soon as possible. Following a
       familiar routine restores a sense of security.
     * Take a bike ride.
     * Buy an ice cream cone.
     * Shoot a game of pool.
     * Read the comics.
     * Go out for breakfast, lunch or dinner.
     * Work in the garden.
     * Meditate or try some relaxation exercises.

   If post-traumatic event symptoms persist you may wish to contact your
   Employee Assistance Program for help.
