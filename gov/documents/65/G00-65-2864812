   As we develop online course materials, one thing has become very
   evident.  We need an abundance of digital photos and current video and
   audio clips that illustrate CAP training and activities and highlight
   CAP people.  As bandwidth and computer capabilities  increase, we will
   be adding digital photos, graphics, video and audio clips, and
   animations  to improve our courses.  A key consideration is making the
   course as interactive as possible without overloading the computer
   systems and modems that currently exist. Instead of just reading this
   text on a computer screen, think how much better it would be to listen
   to this paragraph from an audio file while watching an animated
   illustration or video clip showing distance learning in action.
