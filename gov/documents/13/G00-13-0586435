   With the continued growth in health care costs, interest in cost
   containment remains high.  Therefore, the 2001 Legislature asked the
   Institute to examine policies intended to constrain the growth in state
   health care expenditures.  During the current fiscal year, two areas
   will be examined: (a) the costs and benefits of providing smoking
   cessation treatment to Medicaid recipients and (b) potentially
   avoidable hospitalizations among Medicaid recipients.

   Smoking Cessation:


   Smoking has been recognized as a major cause of preventable illness and
   death.  However, treatment to quit smoking is not provided as a
   Medicaid benefit in Washington.  This report will address the following
   issues:
     * Per person costs of cessation treatments
     * Expected short-term reduction in health care expenditures
       associated with smoking cessation due to lower rates of heart
       attacks, strokes, and low birth weight infants
     * Impact of treatment effectiveness and Medicaid length of stay on
       Medicaid cost savings from cessation treatment
     * Overall costs and savings, by Medicaid subgroups, over a six year
       period


   Potentially Avoidable Hospitalizations:


   Research indicates that certain chronic diseases can largely be managed
   or prevented through outpatient treatment, including physician office
   visits, laboratory tests, and prescription drugs.  Hospitalizations
   associated with these conditions are considered avoidable to the extent
   that timely and adequate outpatient care could have prevented the need
   for hospital care.  This report will examine the following research
   questions:
     * How common are avoidable hospitalizations among Medicaid
       recipients?
     * What types of health care services do Medicaid recipients with
       avoidable hospitalizations receive and how do they differ from
       Medicaid recipients without avoidable hospitalizations?
     * What are the characteristics of Medicaid recipients with avoidable
       hospitalizations and how do they differ from Medicaid recipients
       without avoidable hospitalizations?

   The answers to these questions will help to quantify expenditures
   associated with avoidable hospitalizations and to assist in targeting
   outpatient services to individuals who are likely to have avoidable
   hospitalizations in the future.


   The Institute will report its findings to the Legislature by June 30,
   2002.
