   The NOAA Facilities Office Target Vision defines FIMS as "an
   integrated, centrally managed information management system that allows
   sharing of data and functions across the organization, and provides
   timely, accurate and consistent information to the geographically
   distributed NOAA community".

   As described in the NOAA / FO Baseline Characterization Document, the
   current FO system environment is comprised of several stovepipe systems
   developed with conflicting technologies challenged by data
   inconsistencies, manually intensive processes, costly errors, varying
   user interfaces, serious security issues, etc.

   This prototype demonstrates, in concept, that the Facilities Office can
   realize its vision of an integrated system if it implements the
   recommendations proposed in the Target Architecture Concept of
   Operations.  Note: By design, prototyped features are NOT INTENDED to
   be functional or operational.
