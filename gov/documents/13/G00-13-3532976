   Welcome to the website of the Climate, Ocean and Sea-Ice Modeling
   (COSIM) project at Los Alamos National Laboratory. This new
   implementation was created for greater compatibility with recently
   established administrative and security procedures. Some work remains
   to be done to implement all of the membership services being planned.
   Items in black text in the menus at the top and left are placeholders
   for features to be added. For further discussion, see What's New? As
   always, we welcome your suggestions for improvements.

   COSIM is the homebase of an ocean general circulation model, the
   Parallel Ocean Program (POP), and a sea-ice model (CICE). With the
   arrival of Rainer Bleck, the chief architect and developer of the Miami
   Isopycnic-Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM), Los Alamos now has a stake in
   a second ocean GCM. This website provides access to the source code and
   documentation for all three models.

   In addition, model-output datasets from past simulations with POP can
   be downloaded for analysis. If the desired dataset is not available
   "on-line", a request form is provided that allows you to specify
   subsets of fields and geographical domains to be extracted from
   "off-line" files archived on the Los Alamos mass storage system.

   It is not necessary to have an account on the computer system in the
   Advanced Computing Laboratory (ACL) to take advantage of these
   services, but you must become a "member" of this website. A list of
   services and an application form can be found on the Membership page.
   Members can sign in now, or later via the menu above.
