   [closedfolder.gif]  Applications of Earth Science Research (32)
          This section includes sites that provide information on current
          and potential Earth Science applications, partnerships, and
          programs devoted to both the public and private sectors.

   [closedfolder.gif]  Atmospheric and Climate Studies (10)
          This section includes sites that provide information on the
          atmosphere, clouds, climate and instruments used in different
          atmospheric studies projects.

   [closedfolder.gif]  Biospherics (9)
          This section includes sites that provide information on the
          study of terrestrial ecosystems and their interaction with the
          atmosphere using multi-scale remote sensing, modeling, and
          analytical techniques.

   [closedfolder.gif]  Earth Observing Systems and Science (61)
          The Earth Observing System (EOS) is the centerpiece of NASA's
          Earth Science Enterprise (ESE). It consists of a science
          component and a data system supporting a coordinated series of
          polar-orbiting and low inclination satellites for long-term
          global observations of the land surface, biosphere, solid Earth,
          atmosphere, and oceans.

   [closedfolder.gif]  Earth Science Data Sources and Analysis (75)
          This section links to sites on data assimilation, data analysis,
          data servers, high-performance computing, information technology
          R&D, image repositories and archives.

   [closedfolder.gif]  Earth Science Technology (35)
          This section contains sites that provide diagrams, photos and
          technical information about instruments used in earth science
          studies. It also holds reference sites for spacecraft
          development.

   [closedfolder.gif]  Education and Public Communications (5)
          This section contains all Directorate sites aimed at students,
          teachers, and the general public. Sites include pictures,
          educational resources, question and answer sections, and
          applications of NASA technology for public education, teacher
          programs, systemic reform efforts, curriculum enhancement and
          student programs.

   [closedfolder.gif]  Field Measurements Research and Modeling (4)
          This section contains information about field measurements,
          research, and modeling performed by Directorate programs and
          projects.

   [closedfolder.gif]  General Information (43)
          This section contains information about Earth Sciences
          Directorate conferences and workshops, employment opportunities,
          personnel lists and Earth Science news and research
          publications.

   [closedfolder.gif]  Hydrospheric Studies (20)
          This section links to sites that focus on programs dealing with
          theoretical and experimental research in the oceanic,
          cryospheric and hydrologic sciences. This involves instrument,
          algorithm, and model development; the validation and analysis of
          remotely sensed data from a wide variety of sensors with in situ
          hydrological data, and ultimately, the application of these data
          to geophysical process studies and global change investigations.

   [closedfolder.gif]  Organization (39)
          This section contains links to Earth Sciences Directorate
          organizational sites and information such as mission statements,
          program descriptions, strategic plans, calendars, etc.

   [closedfolder.gif]  Spotlight on Earth Sciences (1)
          This section includes sites that provide information on programs
          which are over $5 million dollars in cost,, are
          highly-publicized or visible programs, or are noteworthy
          programs selected by Directors discretion.

   [closedfolder.gif]  Terrestrial Physics (25)
          This section includes sites that perform research to advance
          knowledge in Earth and planetary science, and to aid in the
          improved management of the resources of the Earth, through the
          application of remote sensing and other space technology.
          Research efforts include: Earth and planetary topography and
          geoid; gravity and magnetic fields and their application to
          Earth and planetary dynamics; Earth motion, Earth structure and
          earthquake mechanisms; motions and mechanics associated with
          plate tectonics and crustal deformation; altimetric
          oceanography; vegetation dynamics and radiative transfer;
          interaction of the vegetated land surface with the atmosphere;
          instruments and data systems; and observational studies.
