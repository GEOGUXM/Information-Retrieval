   Project SUN (Students Understanding Nature) is part of NASA's "GENESIS
   Mission" education outreach effort. The pilot phase of Project Sun was
   based on a small grant from NASA's Earth Systems to develop low cost,
   scientifically accurate instrumentation and computer interfacing, which
   were coupled with older computers such as the Apple II, Macintosh or
   IBM' as dedicated data loggers.

   The current phase of Project SUN now works with low cost commercial
   sensors, which were not available when the project started. Secondary
   students all over the world are contributing to the long term, time
   resolved monitoring of both visible and UV solar surface radiation to
   help us all better understand the environment in which we live.

   Project SUN is now part of the International Science Network (ISN),
   sponsored by the California State University, Northridge colleges of
   Extended Learning, Science and Mathematics, Education and the Jet
   Propulsion Laboratory.

   Eastchester November data is now on the website. Something interesting
   is that some of the visible light data graphs, like the ones for 11/1,
   11/16, and 11/21, show an abrupt increase in energy between 10 and 11
   A.M. Any explanations?

   Alta Loma has data up to the middle of November now posted.

   Eastchester November data is up next...

   Alta Loma has a new photo album. Check it out by going to the photo
   album page and clicking on the "Alta Loma High School SUN pics 2001"
   link.

   Eastchester data is done up to the 26th of October.

   Stay tuned for some pics of Alta Loma as well as more data.

   December 10, 2001

   Alta Loma data is up to the end of October. Most of the curves were
   real smooth, but a couple days had some shakey data. On the 23rd, the
   curve might be shifted one hour behind. I am not sure what time zone
   your data is from (Pacific Standard Time or Pacific Daylight Savings
   Time).
