Image types and parameters

   The camera server takes an image each time a http://<IP Address>/<image
   type>.jpg call is made. In the following description, the http://<IP
   address>/ part is omitted.

   You can use the predefined snapshot types, or adjust the appearance
   using the CGI parameters.

  Snapshot types

   The following snapshot types are available:

   Snapshot type Size (pixels) Description

                                fullsize.jpg

                                 352 × 288
   The standard resolution. Hardware generated in 0.5 seconds.

                                halfsize.jpg

                                 176 × 144
   Excellent for thumbnails. Hardware generated in 0.3 seconds.

                                lastshot.jpg
     The last image taken, either as fullsize or halfsize. Primarily
   intended for software applications for archiving a buffered image.
   Note: lastshot is also updated when the front panel button is pressed
   (fullsize format).
   hugesize.jpg

                                 704 × 576
   This is the highest resolution available. As opposed to fullsize and
   halfsize, this type is software generated, which takes about 18
   seconds.

                                  zoom.jpg
   352 × 288 This is a cutout from the center of hugesize, and takes
   about 8 seconds to generate. The zoom type is equivalent to:
   hugesize.jpg?top=144&left=176&width=352&height=288 See also the
   cropping parameters below.

                                hugesize.bmp
   704 × 576 This is a hugesize in BMP format. Also available in
   fullsize and zoom.

                                hugesize.ppm
   704 × 576 This is a hugesize in PPM format. Also available is
   fullsize and zoom.

  CGI parameters

   You have several possibilities to adjust the size and appearance of
   your images, ranging from small highly compressed to large high-quality
   images. As always on the web, the price for size and quality is time!

   On the Settings page, you specify the default appearance of your images
   (compression, rotation, time stamp, etc.). You can override these
   settings by appending CGI image parameters. Use this syntax:

          <image type>.jpg?<parameter>=<value>[&<parameter>=<value>...]

   Example
   To generate a fullsize snapshot with a time stamp, enter:

          fullsize.jpg?clock=on

   These CGI image parameters are available:

    Parameter  Description
   compression Adjusts the image quality and file size.
               Values: [ medium | high | low ]
      color    Selects color or grayscale image.
               Values: [ normal | none ]
    axislogo   Shows/hides the Axis logotype.
               Values: [ off | on ]
      clock    Shows/hides the time stamp.
               Values: [ off | on ]
    rotation   Rotates the image.
               Values: [ normal | upsidedown | 90deg | 270deg ]
     mirror    Mirrors the image horizontally.
               Values: [ off | on ]
    cropping   Crops a hugesize image.
               Parameters: top, left, width, height
               Values: Number of pixels in multiples of 8.
