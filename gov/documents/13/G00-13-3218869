   [arrow.gif] What is the ADC?

   The Astronomical Data Center ADC is an element of the Space Sciences
   Directorate at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, located in
   Greenbelt, Maryland, U.S.A., near Washington, D.C. We are part of the
   Astrophysics Data Facility of the Space Science Data Operations Office.
   (See ADC's Organization.) We work with collections of astronomical data
   and provide data services the scientific community. The ADC receives
   guidance from a scientific steering committee made up of
   representatives of the astronomical research community.
   What type of stuff can I find here?

   The Astronomical Data Center specializes in archiving and distributing
   collections of data that have been published by professional
   astronomers. Most of these data sets are in the form of
   computer-readable tables of numbers, rather than images. These are
   often known as astronomical catalogs. Tables published in the
   professional journals are simply called journal tables.
   How do I get to the data files?

   The ADC World Wide Web site provides a number of ways to explore the
   Center's data collection. Users can search descriptive text for all
   data sets, browse lists of titles, or look up data sets by the authors
   names. A good place to begin is our Science Data page.

   Once a data set of interest has been found, users can view, subset,
   sort and download the data and documentation. The ADC Data Viewer and
   ADC's mirror of the VizieR service are useful tools for these purposes.
   From the Data Viewer, ADC users can make use of our CatsEye service to
   plot the data on-line.

   The data sets are in anonymous FTP directories. Data files in the
   public archives can also be directly downloaded from our FTP site. The
   top level of the ADC's public FTP site is on adc.gsfc.nasa.gov in the
   directory /pub/adc. The data files can be found in the sub-directory
   /archives. This sub-directory is divided into sub-directories for the
   ADC's two main data categories: larger astronomical catalogs
   (/catalogs), and tables from scientific journals (/journal_tables).

   We also have sets of catalogs available on CD-ROM. To find out how to
   get data on CD-ROM or other media, see ADC Data on CD-ROMs & Other
   Media.
