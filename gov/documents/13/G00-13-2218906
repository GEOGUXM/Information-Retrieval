   What's New  (updated 12/21/2001)
   There are new versions of the METARs and TAFs Java Tools which provide
   capability to view data over Alaska, Hawaii, Europe, and Asia. To view
   one of the new domains, go to either Java tool, then after loading is
   complete, click on the "Overview" button toward the lower-left. You'll
   see a map with the new domains. Then, simply click on a highlighted
   region.
