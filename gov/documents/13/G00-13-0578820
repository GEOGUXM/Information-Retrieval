   AIRPORT PAVEMENT RESEARCH

   Durable, long-life pavements are important in controlling the costs of
   operating the National Aviation System. In addition to annual
   expenditures of approximately two billion dollars on pavements - a
   significant portion coming from the Aviation Trust Fund - pavement
   outages and downtime for maintenance and rehabilitation contribute to
   the costs associated with aviation system delays. It is therefore
   reasonable for the Government to protect its investment.

   Airport pavement R&D has been able to "lean on" the much larger field
   of highway research for many years, and to some extent, still does.
   Until recently, the FAA has also profited from DOD research supporting
   military aircraft. At the present time, however, the largest aircraft
   on the boards are civil aircraft with weights exceeding military
   aircraft and, of course, exceeding highway vehicles by an order of
   magnitude. There is still ample opportunity for the FAA to share and
   benefit from pavement R&D of these sources, but in the field of design
   and evaluation, the FAA must take on new leadership responsibilities.

   In April 1993, the FAA published an essential Airport Pavement Research
   and Development plan, Airport Pavements - Solutions for Tomorrow's
   Aircraft, to deal with the increasing needs of civil aviation
   industries. The plan will introduce modern design and evaluation
   procedures that concentrate on long-life airport pavements for
   existing, as well as new and heavier aircraft. The structured approach
   is based on sound theoretical principles and full-scale validation
   tests. It takes advantage of today's enhanced computer computational
   abilities and provides the flexibility to deal with new, complex
   landing gear configurations that were never contemplated when the
   current design procedures were developed. Executing the plan will
   reaffirm FAA's leadership responsibilities as a key player in the
   aerospace industry.
