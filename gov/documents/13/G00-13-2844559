   Our SC2000 booth demonstrated the interconnecting strands between the
   Data, Computation and Science in High Energy Physics. The exhibit
   showcased software and computing systems developed at and used by the
   Laboratories to handle and present the Mountains of Data we collect.

   Visit our virtual booth at SC2000, some Booth setup videos, and Many
