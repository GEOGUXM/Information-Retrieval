   Issues to be Addressed in the Next Stage of Fusion Research * Burning
   Plasma Physics - strong nonlinear coupling inherent in a fusion
   dominated plasma - access, explore and understand fusion dominated
   plasmas * Advanced Toroidal Physics - develop and test physics needed
   for an attractive MFE reactor - couple with burning plasma physics *
   Boundary Physics and Plasma Technology (coupled with above) - high
   particle and heat flux - couple core and divertor - fusion plasma -
   tritium inventory and helium pumping * Neutron Resistant Materials
   (separate facility) - high fluence testing using "point"neutron source
   * Superconducting Coil Technology does not have to be coupled to
   physics experiments - only if needed for physics objectives * Nuclear

   2000 2005 2010 2015 Year * Even with ITER, the MFE program will be
   unable to address the alpha-dominated burning plasma issues for 15
   years. * Compact High-Field Tokamak Burning Plasma Experiment(s) would
   be a natural extension of the ongoing "advanced" tokamak program and
   could begin alpha- dominated experiments by ~ 10 years. * More than one
   high gain burning plasma facility is needed in the world program. * The
   information "exists now" to make a technical assessment, and decision
   on MFE burning plasma experiments for the next decade. Summary * The
   FIRE "Pre-Conceptual" design point has been chosen to be a "stepping
   stone" between the physics accessible with present experiments and the
   physics required for the ARIES vision of magnetic fusion energy. * A
   compact high field tokamak, like FIRE, has the potential: * address the
   important burning plasma issues, * most of the advanced tokamak issues
   and, * begin to study the strong non-linear coupling between BP and AT
   under quasi-stationary conditions in a $1B class facility. * Some areas
   that need additional work to realize this potential include: * Apply
   recent enhanced confinement and advanced modes to FIRE * Understand
   conditions for enhanced confinement regimes * Compare DN relative to SN
   - confinement, stability, divertor, etc * Complete disruption analysis,
   develop better disruption control/mitigation. * Respond to FIRE
   Engineering Review and NSO PAC on specific physics R&D and engineering
   design and R&D issues.
