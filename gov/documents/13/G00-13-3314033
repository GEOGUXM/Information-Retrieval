                         How To Search Our Web Pages


   This is a searchable index of web pages at the Alaska Fisheries Science
   Center and the National Marine Fisheries Service. Some of the documents
   on our website are lengthy or multi-topic. To maximize the search
   function when retrieving one of those documents, we suggest using the
   "Find" feature under the "Edit" pull-down menu in your Internet browser
   and reentering your  keyword within the document itself to access the
   information you're searching for.
