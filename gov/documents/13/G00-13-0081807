     * Alaska's Unique Terrain: Researchers at the Alaska Synthetic
       Aperture Radar Facility, Fairbanks,October 8, 2001

   AIRSAR data gathered in October 2000 has been used by researchers at
   the Alaska Synthetic Aperture Radar Facility in Fairbanks to create a
   high-resolution digital elevation model of Umnak Island, home to the
   Okmok volcano.  This model can be used to produce new, accurate
   geologic maps, and to aid in the analysis of surface deformation that
   indicates magma movement.
