   Search
   Above each list you will see search fields with the default search type
   being Last Name (Surname). Clicking on the down arrow will display
   additional fields you can search on such as First Name, Agency, etc.
   You can narrow your search down further by supplying a search values in
   the second box. For example, you could choose to search by Last Name
   (Surname) in the first box, and then type in mcm in the second box.
   This would return a list of all users whose last names start with "mcm"
   (McMillan, McMurphy, McMurry, etc).
   You can also do a search based on a partial name, such as vand. This
   will return a list of users whose last name begin with "van", such as
   vandegrift, vantetta, vandora, etc.  You can search for a person by
   phone number if you know the area code and at least a partial number.
   For example, if you type 202-690-1 it will return all USDA personnel
   whose phone numbers begin with these digits.
   NOTE:  Searching under one of the links to an agency (Affiliate,
   Agricultural Marketing Service, etc.) finds only people within that
   agency.
