   Health Information Database Search
   The Deafness and Communication Disorders Database is one of 16
   databases that have joined together to create a health information
   resource called the Combined Health Information Database, or CHID. The
   databases that make up CHID are sponsored by Federal health institutes
   and agencies. We have a list of prepared searches for you on this site,
   or you can perform your own search. When you use CHID you can search
   all 16 subfiles, or you can search the Deafness and Communication
   Disorders (DC) subfile individually. Bookmark this page, or use your

   About Hearing top
   About hearing More than 28 million Americans are deaf or hard of
   hearing and 30 million more are exposed to dangerous levels of noise.
   Levels of hearing impairment vary from a mild but important loss of
   sensitivity, to a total loss of hearing. The largest group of Americans
   suffering from hearing loss is the elderly. Age-related hearing loss
   affects 30 to 35 percent of the U.S. population between the ages of 65
   and 75 years, and 40 percent of the population over the age of 75. The
   most common cause of hearing loss in children is otitis media, a
   disorder that affects predominantly infants and young children. A
   substantial number of hearing impairments are caused by environmental
   factors such as noise, drugs, and toxins. Many acquired sensorineural
   hearing losses may result from a genetic predisposition. Important
   progress has been made during the last decade in understanding the
   auditory system.

   About Balance top
   About balance The balance system is controlled by an organ in the inner
   ear called the labyrinth. It has three main structures that let us know
   when we are in motion and whether the motion is up and down or from
   side to side. These structures can also tell us when we are being
   still, or, if we are moving, what parts of the body are moving.
   Disease, exposure to unusual motion or altered gravitational
   environments, and aging can impair balance. Many Americans have at some
   time experienced a balance or dizziness problem. It is estimated that
   two million adults in the United States, particularly the elderly, have
   chronic impairment from dizziness or difficulty with balance. In a
   study of people age 65 to 75, one third experienced dizziness and
   imbalance. Furthermore, balance-related falls account for more than
   half of accidental deaths in the elderly.
