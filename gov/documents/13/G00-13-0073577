   Interactive Salmon Quiz

   Take the Interactive Salmon Quiz and test your salmon knowledge while
   learning about some simple steps you can take to help restore our
   region's salmon runs and improve water quality.

   People in the Puget Sound region are just plain crazy about the salmon
   that inhabit our local streams, rivers and lakes. When government
   leaders like King County Executive Ron Sims warned that our salmon and
   the waters they live in are in danger, people across the Puget Sound
   region began working to improve salmon habitat and water quality.

   We've made a good deal of progress but there's still lots more we can
   do to help the salmon. Put your salmon savvy to the test and take the
   Interactive Salmon Quiz!

   The Interactive Salmon quiz is available in two versions: Macromedia
   Flash and a non-Flash version. Macromedia's Flash Player software is
   used for online multimedia presentations and often comes bundled with
   the latest version of Internet browsers. If you choose to view the
   Flash version of the quiz, you will need the latest version of the
   Flash Player installed on your PC. To download the latest version of
   the Flash, please visit Macromedia's Web site (external link).

   The Interactive Salmon Quiz is a collaborative effort of the King
   County Roads Division, the King County Water and Land Resources
   Division, and the King County Executive's Office.
