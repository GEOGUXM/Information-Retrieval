   New Look. New Services. Here's Why:

   We hope you appreciate the new, cleaner look of our website. But
   there's lot's more than good looks just below the surface.

   Pages are designed to load faster. They're organized so you can find
   information more efficiently. We've added icons to help you spot the
   kinds of information for which you're looking. And we've made it easy
   for you to share the content of pages with friends and colleagues via
   email.

   ChemLinks has been redesigned, and we've rolled out the beta-version of
   our Chemical Incident Reports Center (CIRC). (We hope you'll try the
   CIRC also and let us know what you think.)

   Even your printer will like us more, because we have a "printer
   friendly" feature that highlights the facts and strips out unnecessary
   page graphics.

   We hope you'll like the new CSB website. And we hope you'll share your
   thoughts and suggestions with us as we "build a better website for
   you".

                         HELP US BUILD A BETTER WEBSITE!
