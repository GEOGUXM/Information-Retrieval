   ND Bankruptcy Court

   The U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of North Dakota, provides internet
   access to public information through PACER (text only) and RACER
   (including images).

   An access fee of $.07 per page, as approved by the Judicial Conference
   of the United States at its September 1998 session, will be assessed
   for access to PACER services on the Internet.

   A login and password issued by the PACER Service Center is required to
   access PACER or RACER. If you do not already have a PACER account,
   visit the PACER Service Center's web site at
   http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov or call (800) 676-6856. It takes about a
   week to receive a login and password from the PACER Service Center.

   Please select from the left menu either the PACER web site or the RACER
   web site.
