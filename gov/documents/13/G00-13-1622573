   The Polar and Great Lakes Ice group works on sea ice analysis from
   satellite, sea ice modeling, and ice-atmosphere-ocean coupling. Our
   work supports the Alaska Region of the National Weather Service, the
   Great Lakes Marine Forecasting group in the Cleveland NWSFO, the
   National Ice Center, and other groups, as well as the Environmental
   Modeling Center, of which the ice group is a part.
