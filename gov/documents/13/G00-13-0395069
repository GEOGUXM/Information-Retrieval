   Fermilab has started on a project designed to bring a Windows 2000
   domain to the lab's Windows user. This is a joint community effort by
   the Computing Division's Operating Systems Support Department, in
   conjunction with the Beams Division, Bussiness Services, Tech Division,
   Particle Physics Division and the DØ Experiment. This project will
   design the Active Directory structure and recommend a basic workstation
   configuration for use in the Windows 2000 domain and is being
   undertaken by the Windows 2000 Migration Working Group.

   The group's charter is as follows;

   Provide Windows users with a secure environment to easily share resources
   across the site and with other labs.
