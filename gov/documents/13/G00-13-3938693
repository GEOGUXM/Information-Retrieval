   202/358-1727) RELEASE: 01-01 NASA CONSIDERS DISCOVERY MISSION PROPOSALS
   It's a difficult decision: with about $300 million to spend, should
   NASA buy a spacecraft which could find Earth-sized planets around
   nearby stars? What about a mission that can peer deep inside Jupiter's
   gaseous atmosphere? Or should the agency go with a mission to orbit the
   two largest asteroids in the Solar System? The answer to that question
   will have to wait about a year. In the first step of a two-step
   process, NASA's Office of Space Science selected three proposals for
   detailed study as candidates for the next mission in the agencys
   Discovery Program of lower cost, highly focused, rapid development
   scientific spacecraft. "The diversity of science represented in these
   three mission proposals is outstanding. NASA will have it's hands full
   picking only one for flight," said Dr. Jay Bergstralh, acting Director
   of Solar System Exploration at NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC. The
   selected proposals were judged to have the best science value among 26
   proposals submitted to NASA in last August. Each selected team will
   receive $450,000 to conduct a four month implementation feasibility
   study focused on cost, management and technical plans, including
   educational outreach and small business involvement. Following detailed
   mission concept studies, NASA intends to select one of the three
   proposals late in 2001 for full development. The mission should be
   launched around 2005 or 2006. NASA has also decided to fund American
   participation in a mission to Mars being flown by another nation. In
   this "Mission of Opportunity" NASA will contribute to seismology,
   meteorology and geodesy (to measure the size and shape of the planet)
   experiments on the French-led NetLander Mission, scheduled for launch
   in 2007. The Mission of Opportunity team will receive $250,000 to
   conduct its feasibility study. The selected Discovery and Mission of
   Opportunity proposals are: 路 The Kepler mission is a space telescope
   specifically designed to detect Earth-size planets around stars in the
   Suns neighborhood of the Galaxy. By monitoring 100,000 stars over a
   four year mission, Kepler could detect up to 500 Earth-size planets and
   up to 1000 Jupiter-size planets. Dr. William Borucki of NASAs Ames
   Research Center at Moffet Field, CA, would lead Kepler at a total cost
   to NASA of $286 million. 路 The Interior Structure and Internal
   Dynamical Evolution of Jupiter (INSIDE Jupiter) mission is a Jupiter
   orbiter designed to observe and measure processes occurring within the
   jovian magnetosphere and atmosphere. INSIDE Jupiter would determine the
   internal structure of the planet by obtaining high resolution maps of
   the magnetic and gravity fields. Dr. Edward J. Smith of the Jet
   Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, would lead INSIDE Jupiter at a
   total cost to NASA of $296 million. 路 The Dawn mission intends to orbit
   Vesta and Ceres, two of the largest asteroids in the Solar System.
   According to current theories, the very different properties of Vesta
   and Ceres are the result of the asteroids being formed and evolving in
   different parts of the Solar System. By observing both asteroids with
   the same set of instruments, Dawn would probe the early Solar System as
   well as determine in detail the properties of each asteroid. Dr.
   Christopher T. Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles
   would lead Dawn at a total cost to NASA of $271 million. 路 A U.S.
   contribution to the French-led NetLander mission will add unique
   capabilities to each of the four landers as well as the orbiter which
   comprise the mission. In 2007, NetLander will create the first science
   network on Mars to study the planet's internal structure. The American
   contribution includes short period seismometers and wind sensors on the
   landers, and a high-resolution geodesy instrument on the orbiter. Dr.
   W. Bruce Banerdt of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, will
   lead the U.S. contribution to NetLander at a total cost to NASA of $35
   million. The Discovery Program is designed to provide frequent,
   low-cost access to space for planetary missions and missions to search
   for planets around other stars. The selected science missions must be
   ready for launch before September 30, 2006, within the Discovery
   Programs cap on the mission cost to NASA of $299 million. The Discovery
   Program is managed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA,
   for the Office of Space Science, Washington, DC. More information on
   the Discovery Program is available at: http://discovery.nasa.gov/
