   Preliminary Accident and Incident Data
     __________________________________________________________________

   Accident Investigation Logo This page provides access to preliminary
   accident and incident data that has been received by the Office of
   Accident Investigation during the last 10 business days.

   The table below lists the accident/incident data according to the date
   of the receipt of the report and tells which of the categories have
   reports available. Please note that the "date of receipt" of
   preliminary reports is normally a day or two after the date of the
   event.

   The value in the cell indicates the number of events. An asterisk (*)
   in a cell indicates that the data in the relevant report has been
   updated since originally available. You can obtain any report by
   clicking on the appropriate cell.

   The 10 days of data is also available in dbf format (dBase and FoxPro)
   for downloading and use in databases and spreadsheets.

   All information is preliminary and subject to change.
