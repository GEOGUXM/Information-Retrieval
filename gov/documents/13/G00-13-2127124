      Thank you for visiting the Department of Social and Health Services
      (DSHS) web site and reviewing our Privacy Notice. This statement
      addresses how we collect, use and secure the information we obtain
      through your use of this web site. This notice covers the following
      topics:

   Information Collected and How it is Used

     What information we collect if you only browse this site.

     If you only browse, read pages, or download information, we will
     gather and store certain information. This information does not
     identify you personally. We automatically collect and store the
     following information about your visit:

    1. The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used. The Internet
       Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your
       Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the
       Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you. This
       address can be translated to determine the domain name of your
       service provider (e.g. xcompany.com or yourschool.edu);
    2. The type of browser and operating system you used;
    3. The date and time you visited this site;
    4. The web pages or services you accessed at this site; and
    5. The web site you visited prior to coming to this web site.

     The information we automatically collect or store is logged and used
     by DSHS only to improve the content of our web services and to help
     us understand how people are using our services. DSHS analyzes the
     web site logs to determine how our web site is being used, so we may
     continually improve the site's usefulness to the public.

     What information we collect if you volunteer it.

     If during your visit to our web site you send us an e-mail, we
     collect the contents of your e-mail message (including audio, video
     and graphics information) along with your return e-mail address. We
     use this information to respond directly to you, address the issues
     you identify in your e-mail, further improve our web site or forward
     it to another agency for appropriate action.

     If you participate in a survey, information we collect is used to
     make improvements to the web site and collect demographic
     information on site use.

     If you perform some other transaction online, information we collect
     will be used solely for the purpose outlined on the form.
