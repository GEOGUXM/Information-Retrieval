                        Welcome to the MECA Web Site

   [USEMAP:nasajpl.gif] [public.gif] [mars.gif]

        In the next 20 years, NASA hopes to send astronauts to Mars.
    These astronauts will be living on the surface of Mars for 500 days.
       What dangers do they face? What can we do to help them prepare?

     * The Mars Environmental Compatibility Assessment (MECA) is a set of
       instruments designed to investigate hazards on the surface of Mars
       that could effect human exploration. MECA was developed at the Jet
       Propulsion Laboratory through NASA's Human Exploration and
       Development of Space (HEDS) Enterprise.
     * Originally part of the Mars 2001 Lander (cancelled in 2000) MECA
       now awaits a ride to Mars and the opportunity to complete its
       mission. Following delivery of the MECA instrument in September
       2000, the MECA project was disbanded though the science team will
       continue activities through FY2001. Based on current Mars
       architectures, the earliest flight opportunity for MECA (or a MECA
       follow-on) will be in 2007.
     * This site provides an overview of the project, descriptions of each
       of the instruments, and a discussion of the science objectives.
