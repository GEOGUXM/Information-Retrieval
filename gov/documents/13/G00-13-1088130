   making every effort to ensure that the information available on our
   website is accessible to all. If you use special adaptive equipment to
   access the Web and encounter problems when using our site, please let
   us know. Write to: fp6z@nih.gov and we will provide the information to
   you in an alternate format. It would be helpful if you can be as
   specific as possible when describing the information you seek.

   If you prefer to call for ethics information, please contact us at
   301-496-1443.  For N I H employees who need assistance with
   accessibility issues, please contact the equal employment opportunity
   officer in your Institute. For N I H employees who need assistance with
   ethics (standards of conduct) issues, please contact your IC Ethics
   Coordinator.
