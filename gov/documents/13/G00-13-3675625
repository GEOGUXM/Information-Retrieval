   Foreword The specific EURATOM Programme comprises two key action,
   "Controlled Thermonuclear Fusion" and "Nuclear Fission, generic
   research on Radiological Sciences and Support for Research
   Infrastructures". This programme is being implemented through indirect
   research and training actions as provided for in Annex III to the 5th
   Framework Programme. The strategic goal of the specific programme is to
   continue the implementation of the established EURATOM Programme in
   line with the requirements of the EURATOM Treaty, which aims to help
   exploit the full potential of nuclear energy, both fusion and fission,
   in a sustainable manner. The historical background and activities
   within the Nuclear Fusion and Nuclear Fission Programmes are very
   different in nature. The Fusion Programme embraces all the research
   activities undertaken in the Member States (plus Associated countries)
   aimed at harnessing fusion, to enable the joint creation of prototype
   reactors for power production to meet the needs of society. The overall
   objective has been to establish the scientific and technological base
   the "next step", meaning the next generation of machines after JET.
   Whilst the Fission Programme provides a more broadly based support to a
   range of scientific and technical projects aimed at enhancing the
   safety of Europe's nuclear installations, improving the competitiveness
   of Europe's industry, ensuring the protection of workers and the public
   from radiation and helping to solve waste management and disposal
   problems. Due to the very different nature of these key actions, it was
   decided by the European Commission to constitute separate 5 year
   Assessment Boards for the Nuclear Fusion and Nuclear Fission areas.
   These Boards have worked independently and the results of their
   assessment are presented as two separate self-contained reports. The
   Executive Summaries of these reports are presented in the following two
   sections. i Executive Summaries and Recommendations Specific Programme:
   Nuclear Energy - Nuclear Fusion - INTRODUCTION Future long-term energy
   scenarios show a steady increase in world-wide energy demand, driven by
   the increase in the global population and the rapid growth in energy
   consumption per capita in the developing economies. In parallel, there
   is an increasing awareness of the environmental impacts of energy such
   as the climate change impacts arising from the burning of fossil fuels.
   Consequently, the need for new non-polluting and sustainable forms of
   energy is growing. The harvest of renewable energy is already partly
   developed but there are issues associated with its availability,
   location and integration into the network; nuclear fission is another
   available option although there are concerns about its safety and the
   long-term issues of waste disposal. Fusion still requires further
   research and long-term development but appears to have the potential to
   provide a CO2 emission-free, sustainable, safe and clean high-density
   energy option. - OBJECTIVES The long-term objective of the European
   Fusion Programme is to embrace all the research activities undertaken
   in the Member States (plus Associated countries) aimed at harnessing
   fusion, and to enable the joint creation of prototype reactors for
   power production to meet the needs of society. During the past 5 years,
   activities to establish the scientific and technological base for the
   `Next Step', a machine demonstrating a burning plasma under reactor
   conditions, have been a major focus of the programme. In the 4th and
   5th FPs this has centred on ITER, and Europe has been an active
   participant in the engineering design activities together with Japan,
   the Russian Federation and the USA. - MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS The Fusion
   Programme is probably the best example of European Added Value in the
   Community's R&D Programme and can be considered as a model for the
   European Research Area. The good co-ordination and co-operation between
   the Community and national research programmes has enabled far greater
   achievements to be made than would be possible at a national level.
   During the last 5 years, the Programme has produced a wealth of high
   quality results in line with its objectives. The major European
   activity at JET and in the ITER Project has brought world visibility
   and has established Europe in the leading role in fusion activities
   world-wide. The JET Programme has met all the objectives defined in the
   1978 Council Decision and those of subsequent extensions and has
   exceeded original expectations; JET remains the most relevant machine
   for supporting reactor-orientated fusion research ii world-wide and is
   currently the only tokamak capable of D-T operation. The work on JET is
   complemented by the studies on concept improvement, long-term
   technology and safety and environmental studies, undertaken within the
   national research institutes in Europe, using a range of fusion
   machines. Together, these activities have enhanced the level of
   understanding in fusion science, demonstrated a number of the key
   features of the technical design for a `Next Step' machine and enabled
   the development of a detailed and fully integrated design for such a
   machine. Major achievements towards the `Next Step' during the period
   include: * Successful D-T campaign resulting in the production of
   record fusion power at JET (>16 MW for about one second, and 4-5 MW for
   about 4 seconds, generating 22 MJ of fusion energy) and the
   demonstration of alpha heating, a pre-requisite for the `Next Step'. *
   Demonstration of `Next Step' relevant technologies such as remote
   handling complex in-vessel components and closed cycle tritium
   handling. * A substantially increased level of involvement by European
   industry, both in the assessment of ITER design reports and in the
   construction of components. For example, the fabrication of a large
   superconducting model coil (scale 1:3) for ITER. The programme has
   contributed to the development of a strong and competent scientific,
   technological and industrial community. During the past 5 years, the
   programme has directly employed around 2000 scientists and engineers
   (including about 250 PhD students). It has directly contributed to
   Community policies on training and has the highest level of mobility of
   researchers of any European Programme at around 500 person-months per
   year. European industry has grown in competence together with the
   fusion programme and can provide all the manufacturing and technical
   support required by the programme. The high level of technical
   sophistication and exacting requirements of the programme in areas such
   as superconductors, remote handling, vacuum technology, power
   electronics and brazing and welding, has enhanced the skill base and
   the quality of standards found in European industry. This has led to
   substantial developments in their specialised capabilities, personnel
   enhancement and the quality of their products. Europe now has by itself
   all the required technical, engineering and industrial capabilities to
   proceed to the `Next Step' and take the fusion programme forward. -
   LESSONS LEARNED AND CONCLUSIONS Many lessons have been learned from the
   Fusion Programme of which the following three are of particular
   importance: * Large, long-term R&D projects require strong and constant
   sponsorship and high profile and competent leadership. In the past, the
   European Union (and some Member States) have given such sponsorship to
   the Fusion Programme and, in particular, to JET. This allowed the
   programme management to exploit the Programme very effectively. ITER,
   in its highly international configuration (which has inevitably
   introduced complications both at the strategic and management level),
   seems to have iii progressively lost sponsorship, despite the excellent
   work done by the entire ITER team. The US withdrawal from ITER (1998)
   and the financial crisis in the Russian Federation has led to the
   requirement to redesign a lower cost New-ITER with less ambitious
   objectives. Moreover, international uncertainty still exists. * Such
   long-term, challenging and costly programmes require a firm, stable and
   powerful legal framework within which to be managed. Again, the JET
   experience is meaningful and, with the obvious adaptations to the new
   context, a legal framework with greater management responsibilities
   coherent with the requirements of the Next Step will have to be
   adopted. * The fusion community has always stressed the differences
   between fission and fusion in terms of safety and environmental impact,
   and all the studies done in the recent years confirm this point.
   Nevertheless, the general public still tends to view the two
   technologies in the same light. More attention is required on this
   issue. During the last 5 years, the programme has achieved very
   important results, confirming fusion should now be considered as a
   credible option in the search for clean, large-scale power generation
   systems. Nevertheless, there are still a number of important
   scientific, technological and engineering issues to be addressed before
   a commercial power plant can be realised. At least two more generations
   of machines are envisaged before building a prototype reactor and,
   based on present planning, large-scale electricity would be produced in
   around 50 years. Recent history has shown how sensitive the Programme
   is to delays in the decisions. The postponement of the construction of
   ITER has already introduced a delay of almost 10 years. From the
   organisational and programme point of view, the last 2 years have been
   particularly complicated for the Fusion Programme due to the need for
   new organisational structures and framework agreements and due to the
   high level of uncertainty regarding the `Next Step'. The Board's
   impression is that, in spite of this situation, the programme has been
   well co-ordinated and efficiently run by the Commission as shown by the
   results obtained. - RECOMMENDATIONS 1. The European Fusion Programme
   has helped to place European science, technology and industry at the
   leading edge of development in this sector and this advantage should be
   defended and possibly increased. 2. The European Fusion Programme
   should continue to be reactor orientated and the construction of the
   'Next Step' should be started in FP6. This should be the first priority
   and some of the budget should be specifically earmarked for the Next
   Step. The budget should be at least at the present level, although a
   constant budget may lead to a reduction in the funding available for
   the other activities. If the budget continues to remain at the same
   level in FP7 and FP8, the Board believes it will still be possible to
   finance the completion of the construction of the Next Step, provided
   there is a reorientation of the activities in the national research
   institutes. 3. To proceed with the `Next Step' in the international
   collaboration perspective of the New-ITER, the European Union should
   within the next 2 years: * Conclude negotiations on the legal and
   organisational structure of the future venture iv * Actively seek a
   European site for the New-ITER, since this is the best option from a
   European viewpoint. * Conduct a thorough review of the financial
   issues, including the different financial costs and benefits of siting
   it in Europe, Canada or Japan, and establish the extent to which Japan
   would support the construction of New-ITER outside Japan. * Examine in
   detail the recent interesting expression of interest received from the
   Canadian Consortium. 4. In the same 2-year period, due to the
   uncertainty over the outcome of the international negotiations, Europe
   should study an alternative to New-ITER, which would be suitable to be
   pursued by Europe alone. For example, a copper magnet machine which
   would still achieve the required objective of demonstrating a burning
   plasma under reactor conditions even if this would delay the
   integration of the superconducting technologies. Europe would then be
   ready by mid FP6 to drive forward the development of fusion even in the
   event of a further lack of positive decision on the construction of the
   New-ITER. 5. In the meantime, in FP5, limited investment on JET should
   be allowed to exploit the full value of the machine. This will also
   enable the fusion community to further prepare for the operation of the
   `Next Step'. 6. The Fusion Programme, as part of a long-term
   sustainable energy policy, is highly demanding from a political and
   operational viewpoint and requires renewed support from the political
   authorities with an explicit endorsement of the tight timescale
   suggested for the `Next Step'. In view of the Programme's evolution to
   a more managerial phase, a more innovative operational solution should
   be studied, to be approved together with FP6. There are several
   alternatives, such as an agency in charge of the entire fusion
   programme (and EFDA could be considered as a first step) or a legal
   entity belonging to Euratom, to be responsible for the implementation
   of the Next Step including the management of the money earmarked for
   this specific objective. In any case, the Committee structure governing
   the fusion programme should be streamlined. 7. Following a positive
   decision on the construction of the Next Step, a refocusing of the
   European Programme will be required. For this purpose, a critical
   assessment of the different European machines and their funding should
   be undertaken. 8. A Materials Research Programme is necessary to
   develop high performance, low activation materials for machines after
   the `Next Step'. This programme should be run in parallel with the
   `Next Step' to ensure the materials are ready when required and should
   include new materials concepts. It is recommended that international
   discussions on a 14 MeV neutron source Materials Testing Facility or
   alternative testing solutions are brought to a decision on a timescale
   consistent with reactor development. 9. The public acceptance of fusion
   is a key factor in its development as an energy option. Concern on this
   point has been expressed in several of the recent annual monitoring
   reports for the fusion programme despite increased effort on the safety
   and environmental aspects of fusion. Environmental issues should be
   considered as a full programmatic action, using a broader and more
   structured approach, in parallel to reactor development (Figure 6 in
   the report). The programme should v continue to address issues such as
   fuel cycle management, waste management and recycling and all the
   safety aspects. In the short-term, a small Working Group could be set
   up to review the safety and environmental results obtained to date and
   to actively promote the benefits of fusion power to a broad range of
   political and public stakeholders. 10. There are various examples where
   there has been the transfer of technologies, skills and experience from
   the fusion programme to other areas of science and technology, and
   evidence for the transfer of know-how and experience to European
   industry. Such transfers should be exploited in a more structured and
   entrepreneurial way in response to market demand. Specific Programme:
   Nuclear Energy - Nuclear Fission and Radiological Sciences This report
   covers the 5 years assessment of the research performed in the period
   1995- 1999 under Nuclear Fission Safety in Framework Programme 3 (FP3)
   (1990-1994), Framework Programme 4 (FP4) (1994-1998) and Key Action 2:
   Nuclear Fission and Research of a Generic Nature in Radiological
   Sciences in Framework Programme 5 (FP5) (1998-2002) under the heading
   of Research and Training in the Field of Nuclear Energy. It is
   presented in the format of FP5. The overriding objectives of this field
   of activity are to enhance the safety of Europe's nuclear installations
   and improve the competitiveness of European industry. Within these
   broader objectives, the more specific aims are * to contribute to the
   protection of workers and the public from radiation and the safe and
   effective management and final disposal of radio-active waste, * to
   explore innovative concepts that are sustainable and have potential
   longer term economic, safety, health and environmental benefits, * to
   contribute towards maintaining a high level of expertise and competence
   in nuclear technology and safety and * to contribute towards the safe
   and competitive use in other industries and medicine of ionising
   radiation and towards the safe management of natural sources of
   radiation. This area of research has been developed over many years and
   these objectives are to be seen in the light of continuous progress
   towards a coherent but evolving body of knowledge. The achievements of
   the programme during the past five years are many and diverse and are
   summarised below. Overall we believe that the standard of scientific
   quality has been maintained at a high level and that much European
   Added Value has been achieved through joint projects, networking,
   information dissemination and a general improvement in understanding of
   common problems. The research has been of value to a number of end
   users, including Industry, Regulators, Research Institutes and more
   generally to people involved in the use of or exposure to radiation
   However, we note that the resources available to this important area of
   research have been reduced during the evolution of FP3 - 4 - 5 to the
   point now that some of the basic objectives for operational safety,
   radiation protection and waste can no longer be achieved. In addition
   this could threaten the essential continuity of research in an area
   which depends on long term development. vi The processes of management
   of the programme are improving, but are still heavily bureaucratic and
   cumbersome. This could be improved by giving more authority to
   Commission staff to manage once agreement has been reached on the
   overall objectives and content of the programme. In a similar vein,
   project co-ordinators need to be able to show more flexibility and
   leadership once projects have been awarded. Major Achievements. There
   have been many significant achievements from the diverse and
   comprehensive coverage of research topics in this area. These are
   highlighted below according to the headings of FP5. More detailed
   descriptions are available in the main text under the same headings.
   Operational Safety of Existing Installations. Plant Life Extension.
   This area of Research was not identified separately in FP4, but a
   number of projects of relevance were carried out. These have lead to a
   much better appreciation of the interacting aspects of materials
   performance which have to be drawn together to optimise plant life
   management. Thematic networks have been very successful in this area,
   leading to, for example, laying the ground work for qualification and
   industrial validation of methods for the non-destructive examination
   techniques for aged material. Future work should be focused on the
   needs of Regulators. Severe accident management. Research in this area
   has made an important contribution to an international effort over many
   years to develop an understanding of severe accident (core melting)
   phenomenology. Whilst an area as complex and diverse as this is never
   likely to be "closed", it is clear that a degree of maturity has been
   achieved and this has lead to the direct use of the research results in
   developing severe accident management schemes, both preventative and
   mitigative, and in providing a sound basis for innovative new designs.
   Specific results in severe accident research that underpin these
   conclusions include: * The improved understanding of the coolability of
   corium ex-vessel. * The reduction in the estimated likelihood of a
   major in-vessel steam - explosion. * The improved understanding of the
   deflagration of hydrogen leading directly to better methods of control.
   * The minimisation of the threat to containment from Direct Containment
   Heating (DCH). * A better understanding of the leakage of aerosols
   through micro-cracks in concrete leading to a reduction in the expected
   fission product release following a severe accident. * Safety of the
   Fuel Cycle. This area covers a very diverse range of issues. Questions
   of spent fuel management and disposal are often dealt with at a
   national level, but there are a number of common issues, such as
   repository performance assessment. The balance of research has shifted
   from waste management (which are relatively near term issues) to
   Partitioning and Transmutation (which is increasingly seen as being
   very long term). This is reflected in our recommendations. In waste and
   spent fuel management and disposal a number of projects have been
   particularly successful. These include: * Experiments in underground
   Research facilities have been the focus of international collaboration.
   Eventhough the EC funds only a small fraction of these major long term
   projects, it gets good added value through encouraging team work and
   sharing results. * The Spent fuel Performance Assessment Project (SPA)
   covered all elements needed to come to a total system analysis of spent
   fuel disposal in various host rock vii formations. Major achievements
   were made in the linking of laboratory work, data from field
   experiments and modelling. This showed clearly where there were still
   deficiencies in knowledge and challenges for strategy. Progress was
   also made through the input of natural systems studies. * Many
   uncertainties remain that need to be clarified through continued basic
   studies. Studies on basic phenomena such as natural analogue projects
   (e.g. the Palmottu and Oklo projects) were very successful; progress
   was also made in other areas, such as migration and corrosion.
   Partitioning and Transmutation. A re-appraisal of the possibility of
   separating and/or transmuting long-lived radioactive species has lead
   to a new interest in research in the area. In contrast to some other
   important areas the EC budget for research in P&T has increased
   considerably during the past five years. This priority is
   controversial. Research to date in transmutation strategies has shown
   that any plan to "burn" plutonium or other minor actinides will require
   a very long time and will require the investment of very large sums in
   the technology. It is not clear which technology will prove the most
   attractive (ADS1 or LMR2) and further strategic studies including
   safety and waste management are needed before any significant
   investment decisions are made. Because of the long-term nature of this
   work, on balance we believe it would be more appropriately placed in
   the area of Safety and Efficiency of Future Systems. In partitioning
   there has been specific progress in the separation of trivalent
   actinides (americium and curium) from lanthanides which could lead to a
   process with a single cycle allowing direct extraction of the minor
   actinides from the very high level liquid waste which results from
   reprocessing. Safety and Efficiency of Future Systems. This is a new
   area established for FP5, although related topics were included in FP4
   under the heading of Innovative and Revisited Systems. Its aims include
   assessing new or previously discarded reactor concepts that would be
   potentially cheaper, safer, more sustainable, producing less waste and
   reducing the risk of diversion. The development of nearer term
   evolutionary plant is seen as being the responsibility of national or
   multi-national programmes. Results from the previous programmes have
   demonstrated the technology of some passive safety systems. Radiation
   Protection. In FP5, this area was introduced as an end user oriented
   part of the key action 2. It contains a number of sections that overlap
   to some extent, each of which is covered below. It is intimately
   related to the following section on Generic Research in Radiological
   Sciences and we shall recommend that these two sections be considered
   together in future. Risk Assessment and Management. Tools for risk
   assessment and management have been further developed. There has been
   an appreciation of the need to better understand how acceptance of risk
   at a social level can be achieved and the project TRUSTNET is an
   important contribution to that, and is continuing in FP5. The
   ETHOS-project was particularly successful in showing how the
   involvement of the local populations is vital in the rehabilitation
   process. Monitoring and Assessment of Occupational Exposure. Progress
   in optimisation of occupational exposure in a variety of applications
   resulted in recommendations to the EC, national authorities 1 ADS;
   Accelerator Driven Systems 2 LMR; Liquid Metal Reactors viii and
   utilities on the use of the ALARA-principle. Off-site Emergency
   Management. The RODOS system for assisting in off-site emergency
   management is now available for operational use. It represents the work
   of 40 Institutes in 20 different countries (in both the East and the
   West). Restoration and long-term management of contaminated
   environments. Models have been developed to identify areas with high
   transfer capacity of caesium. Significant progress was made in the
   development of more holistic countermeasure strategies by integrating
   issues of private and environmental costs and benefits, environmental
   management and consumer attitudes and behaviour into the countermeasure
   selection process. Generic Research in Radiological Sciences. Estimates
   of the risks from exposure to ionising radiation are the basis of all
   radiation protection, thus they have to cover the wide range of
   radiation types and exposure conditions in the natural environment, the
   work place and the clinic to be of practical value. The following are
   some of the important achievements in this area. Radiation protection
   and health. Co-ordination of work under FP3 and FP4 in this field has
   lead to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which radiation
   exposure leads to the induction of cancers and particularly on
   predisposition. Recent developments in gene research, molecular
   biology, irradiation techniques (single cell irradiation using soft
   energy microbeams) and computer modelling provided new possibilities to
   improve our knowledge of the effects of low doses of radiation.
   Environmental transfer of radioactive material. The work has focussed
   on a better understanding of transfer mechanisms and developing of
   ecological models to predict the fluxes of radionuclides in different
   types of environment. For the future, a holistic approach to
   environmental protection including radiation protection is required.
   Industrial and medical uses and natural sources of radiation. Progress
   has been made in the field of optimisation in intervention radiology
   (IR), paediatrics, Computer Assisted Tomography (CT) and fluoroscopy as
   well as developing image quality criteria. Because of the higher
   sensitivity of children to radiation a number of studies have focussed
   on developing guidance on paediatric radiology. For natural sources of
   radiation, studies on the risk arising from the inhalation of radon and
   its decay products, including lung modelling, epidemiology, and an
   intercomparison of passive radiation detectors, produced important
   results. Internal and external dosimetry. Biokinetic and dosimetric
   models have been produced to improve estimates of dose from intakes of
   radionuclides by adults and children. An extensive database of dose
   coefficients was published to meet the needs of health physics
   practitioners and researchers in radiological protection. A real
   breakthrough was achieved in mixed neutron detection with important
   commercial possibilities. ix Major Conclusions and key issues for the
   future. Overall recommendations and conclusions are given in section 7
   of the main report. Recommendations concerning specific issues are
   included in the appropriate sections of the main text. The following is
   an abbreviated summary of the main conclusions and issues for the
   future. 1. The five years assessment has shown that the specific
   programme in nuclear fission safety continues to provide results of
   high scientific value, which are relevant to the needs of Industry,
   Regulators and those concerned with radioactivity generally. It is seen
   as meeting most of its overall objectives. 2. The reductions in funding
   of FP3, FP4 and FP5 mean that sufficient funds are not available for
   important research needed to tackle key objectives of the programme. 3.
   The Commission staff should be empowered to be more pro-active in
   seeking research needed to fulfil agreed programme objectives. 4.
   Project co-ordinators should be given more freedom to manage the work,
   including financial flexibility once clearly defined responsibilities
   have been established and projects awarded. 5. The title "Nuclear
   Fission" no longer represents the current balance of the programme. We
   suggest that Radiation Protection be grouped with Generic Research in
   Radiological Sciences separately from Nuclear Fission. 6. The time
   frame for developing the technology for Partitioning and Transmutation
   is very long. We therefore believe that it should be considered in
   future along with "Safety and Efficiency of Future Systems" so that its
   funding and priority can be better judged as it is linked directly to
   the long-term needs of the Community. 7. European Centres of Excellence
   are supported in principle, but care is needed to guarantee the input
   of creative research activities and not to create monopolies. 8.
   Networking has proved to be a useful tool and should be further
   developed and given a higher priority in future. 9. A vision and
   strategy needs to be found in order to rationalise the training aspects
   of the programme as they make a potentially important contribution to
   the maintenance of the knowledge and skill base in the future. 10.
   Common strategic planning should be reinforced between FP and JRC
   programmes, and more co-ordination directed towards the needs of other
   concerned DGs, in particular to support horizontal actions. 11.
   Scientific dissemination is generally very good. Dissemination of
   research results is important for non-specialist end users,
   decision-makers and the public and should be done professionally. 12.
   Efforts should be made to make research data and tools available to
   other parts of the FP and to a wider technical catchment area. For
   example ESA where radiation effects are of importance. 13. A common
   theme emerging from many of the research areas is risk governance.
   Developing an understanding of such complex systems is not limited to
   nuclear activities and we recommend that very broad inter and multi
   disciplinary studies are undertaken by the Commission as a horizontal
   activity. x Table of Contents

   Fusion has long been recognised as a potential energy source for
   mankind. Against the current background of increasing world-wide demand
   for energy, finite resources of fossil fuels and international concerns
   over climate change issues, nuclear fusion is one of the few long-term
   energy supply options currently under investigation. 2.2 The long-term
   objective of the European Fusion Programme is to embrace all the
   research activities undertaken in the Member States (plus Associated
   countries) aimed at harnessing fusion, and to enable the joint creation
   of prototype reactors for power production to meet the needs of
   society. The Programme has developed to its present standing over the
   past four decades, starting with the original Euratom Treaty in 1957
   and the first Association agreement with CEA, signed in 1959. Since
   that time the number of Associations has increased to 20, and most
   recently has extended to include agreements with CEE. Financed wholly
   by public funds from the Commission and Member State Governments, it
   represents itself as a single entity in its relations with other
   international fusion programmes. Collaboration with other non-EU
   nations (USA, Japan and Russia) plays a key part in the implementation
   of the Programme. At a European level, the overall expenditure for
   fusion orientated research has reached 10 billion Euros (1999 value) of
   which approximately 40% has been funded from the Community budget. 2.3
   The specific objectives of the thermonuclear fusion programme have
   remained very consistent between the 3rd, 4th and 5th Framework
   Programmes (see Table 1). The overall objective has been to establish
   the scientific and technological base for the `Next Step', meaning the
   next generation of machines after JET. In the 4th Framework Programme
   this `Next Step' has centred on ITER. Overall, this has resulted in a
   scientifically and politically coherent programme. Table 1: Objectives
   of the Framework Programmes Programme Programme Objectives 3rd FP "The
   establishment of the scientific and technological base for (1990-94)
   the construction of an installation designed to achieve and study the
   ignition and prolonged combustion of plasma and related technological
   problems (Next Step)." 4th FP "The objective of the Next Step
   activities will be to establish the (1994-98) engineering design of an
   experimental reactor, in the frame of the quadripartite international
   agreement ITER, between Euratom, Japan, the Russian Federation and the
   United States of America." 5th FP "To develop further the necessary
   basis for the possible (1998-2002) construction of an experimental
   reactor. This key action should thus enhance the Community's
   preparedness, from a scientific, technical, financial and
   organisational point of view, to decide on and support such a future
   experimental reactor." 5 2.4 The European Nuclear Fusion Programme has
   been organised as a joint effort between the EURATOM and the Member
   States. This coordination of activities has been successfully achieved
   by a combination of bilateral contracts between the Commission and the
   relevant national research institutes (Association Contracts) in each
   EU Member State and Switzerland, and a series of joint European
   agreements which have enabled the programme to undertake activities
   which would have been impossible at a national level. The first major
   European research initiative was the construction and operation of the
   Joint European Torus (JET), which has been acknowledged worldwide as a
   major success and has reinforced Europe's position at the forefront of
   fusion development. This was established in 1978, as a Joint
   Undertaking (a solution foreseen in the Euratom Treaty to combine
   Community and Member States funds) and up until the end of 1999 has
   been managed by the JET Council, comprising representatives of the
   Commission and the organisations from Member States. Similarly, the NET
   Agreement (1983-1998) provided the framework for European collaboration
   in research and development in support of the Next European Torus and
   then in 1992 facilitated European participation in the International
   Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Project which was initially
   based on a quadripartite Agreement between the European Atomic Energy
   Community, and the Governments of Japan, Russian Federation and the
   USA. At the beginning of 1999, the new European Fusion Development
   Agreement (EFDA) came into force; it has been signed by the Commission
   and all the national research institutes and provides a framework for
   the continuity of European activities in the field of thermonuclear
   fusion. In particular, the EFDA Workplan now includes the technology
   work carried out by the national research institutes and by European
   industry, European contributions to international collaboration such as
   ITER and the exploitation of the JET facilities after 1999. The latter
   is specifically covered by the JET Implementing Agreement (JIA),
   between Euratom and the other parties of EFDA, and includes provisions
   relating both to the technical programme and the financing of the
   activities. 2.5 During the past 8 years, ITER has been a major focus of
   European activities. In July 1998, the ITER Engineering Design
   Activities were completed in line with the initial objectives. It was
   decided that the design phase should be extended for a further three
   years to enable the completion of technical tests, the exploration of a
   less expensive option with less ambitious objectives and the
   investigation of non-technical issues such as the licensing
   requirements. In July 1999, the US formally decided to leave the ITER
   Agreement. This decision has affected the world-wide fusion scenario
   and requires a new appraisal of the European Programme. ***** 2.6 The
   extensive European activities undertaken during the review period, both
   in direct support of ITER and in the development of concept
   improvements and longer term technology, have been reviewed against the
   background of international activities. The Board's activity and this
   report have been prepared in line with the Broad Guidelines for the 5
   Year Assessment of the RTD Framework Programmes issued by the
   Commission. It has been undertaken in accordance with the legislative
   requirements as given in Article 5 of the Council Decision of 6 22
   December 1998 on the Fifth EC Framework Programme and the Euratom
   Framework Programme, and with Article 4 of the Council Decision of 25
   January 1999 adopting the Specific Programme in the field of nuclear
   energy (Euratom). 2.7 The Commission asked a Board of seven
   independent, external experts to review the implementation of the
   Fusion Programme over the period 1995-1999. The Board met 9 times in
   the period 28 September 1999 to 30 April. In order to review thoroughly
   the activities of the programme, the Board members undertook an
   extensive series of visits, meeting representatives from 16 national
   research institutes. This enabled them to discuss directly with the
   institutes' staff the activities being undertaken and their role within
   the European Fusion Programme. (Details of the activities at each of
   the national institutes are included in Annex 1). In addition, the
   Board has been provided with a large number of papers describing
   different aspects of programme. 3 Assessment of Implementation and
   Achievements 3.1 EFFICIENCY 3.1.1 Fusion is a highly challenging,
   long-term, scientific and technological objective. Its development
   requires permanent relationships and clear and stable mission
   definitions. The Fusion Programme provides a framework for a
   decentralised structure comprising a series of bilateral Association
   Contracts (between the Commission and national research institutes) and
   a number of specific fusion programme agreements (see Annex 2). The
   programme management in Brussels accounts for less than 1.5% of the
   community budget. This structure has provided a framework for the
   technical co-ordination and financing of European activities that is
   well accepted by the scientific, technical and industrial players in
   this field. It explicitly gives them responsibilities relating to the
   management, technical and financial direction of their work and, up to
   now, has proved to be satisfactory. This structure will need to be
   reviewed in light of the future development of the programme. 3.1.2 In
   the 4th FP, the European Fusion Programme was a separate programme but
   in the 5th FP, the Fusion Programme is a Key Action within the
   Preserving the Ecosystem Programme; this has increased the overall
   complexity of the management structure. In the 4th FP, the Fusion
   Programme was co-ordinated by the European Commission, advised by the
   Consultative Committee for the Fusion Programme (CCFP) and the STC
   Euratom. In the 5th FP, there is also an advisory body for the Key
   Action and in practice there is some overlap between the
   responsibilities of these groups. 7 3.1.3 The JET Joint Undertaking was
   a novel solution to combine EC and Member State funds. This solution
   proved to be a good framework with the exception of the statute
   concerning staffing. Staff were seconded to JET through two employers,
   namely the UKAEA and the Commission, which led to tensions and legal
   problems, and contributed to the termination of the Joint Undertaking
   with the loss of experience and some competent staff. It is hoped that
   the new European Fusion Development Agreement will continue to provide
   the required flexibility, at least in the short-term. The staffing
   issues have been specifically addressed, although the staff seconded
   under the new arrangements will take some time to become as effective
   as the previous staff. 3.1.4 Fusion, as a long-term programme, requires
   the highest level of continuity. Late adoption of the Council Decisions
   concerning the extension of JET and the successive FPs has made the
   continuity of the programme and investment difficult. The change in the
   legal framework from the Joint Undertaking to the new EFDA framework is
   creating difficulties for the operation of JET during the present
   transitional period. It is envisaged that the new arrangements under
   EFDA will enable the further exploitation and subsequent closure of
   JET; presently, there is only a legal framework for fusion activities
   up to the end of the FP5. 3.1.5 The Fusion Programme has been affected
   by the unavoidable break in the flow of funds between successive
   Framework Programmes. However, within the national research institutes,
   the "association contract formula" has ensured continuity between
   successive Framework Programmes. As a consequence, from the technical
   viewpoint, the transition between the FPs has been relatively smooth,
   and has enabled the programme of work to proceed without any major
   interruptions. 3.1.6 Due to the specialised nature of the Programme
   there has been only limited co-ordination with other Programmes under
   the FPs. The only exception has been the need for co-ordination with
   the fusion related work undertaken within the JRCs. This need has
   declined following the decision of the JRCs to withdraw from fusion
   work. At present there are a few 4th FP projects nearing completion but
   no new activities under 5th FP. 3.1.7 Potential opportunities for the
   cross-benefit of the Fusion Programme with other framework programmes,
   for example in the areas of materials and remote handling, have not
   been fully exploited. 3.2 EFFECTIVENESS 3.2.1 The stated scientific and
   technical objectives of the Fusion Programme have been achieved and
   almost always met within budget. The total yearly expenditure on Fusion
   R&D, averaged over the period 1996-1999, has been around 3% higher than
   that in the previous 5 year period (Figure 1). Whilst the total level
   of investment has remained approximately the same, there has been a
   major shift in the nature of the investments. During the period
   1991-1995, 34% of the investment was on JET whereas, during the last 5
   years, this has dropped to under 8 4% with substantial increases in
   ITER related activities and within the National research institutes.
   The 4% increase in personnel costs reflects, in part, the `ageing' of
   the staff involved in the Fusion Programme. Figure 1 Yearly expenditure

   decreased from 44.6% (period 1991-1995) to 41.5% (period 1996-1999) as
   shown in Figure 2. There has also been a shift in the distribution of
   Community funding between the different areas of the programme (Next
   Step, JET, Concept Improvements, Technology and Administration). The
   level of funding for Next Step activities has increased, balanced by a
   decrease for Concept Improvements and Technology. This is in line with
   the increased emphasis on the Next Step activities during the past 5
   years. Yearly funding Yearly funding averaged over the period

   Programme has produced a wealth of high quality results in line with
   the objectives of the Programme (see Section 5.3). The major European
   activity at JET and in the ITER Projects has also brought world 9
   visibility, which in turn helps to promote high class European research
   capabilities and has established Europe in a leading role in fusion
   activities world-wide. 3.2.4 The Programme has been developing the
   technologies and improving the concepts required to develop nuclear
   fusion as a future energy source. It has concentrated effort on the use
   of magnetic confinement and mostly on tokamaks. The success of JET
   operations tends to support this decision. 3.2.5 To date, the JET
   Programme has met all the objectives defined in the 1978 Council
   Decision and those of subsequent extensions and has exceeded original
   expectations. The successful JET Deuterium-Tritium campaign, the
   development of an active gas handling system and the sophisticated
   remote handling facilities demonstrate the direct applicability of the
   science and technology activities to the overall objective of
   developing fusion as a long-term energy source. 3.2.6 The ITER machine
   has been conceived as an important step towards the development of a
   prototype fusion reactor. One of its defined objectives is to
   demonstrate ignition. The combined effect of the US withdrawal from
   ITER in July 1999, the economic problems in Russia, the moratorium on
   large-scale research investment in Japan, and the unwillingness within
   Europe to invest more money in the construction of ITER, necessitated a
   reappraisal of the ITER objectives, design criteria and the cost of the
   machine. The subsequent decision to extend the design activities until
   2001 and proceed with the design of a new machine (New-ITER), with a
   less ambitious set of scientific objectives3 and approximately 50%
   reduction in budget, has required additional design work. This work has
   been able to draw on the same scientific basis on which the original
   ITER design was based and a viable alternative has been designed. The
   relatively short timescale on which this has been achieved has
   demonstrated the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the ITER
   teams. 3.2.7 The delays in the decision process regarding the
   construction of ITER, and the entry of the programme into a new
   generation of machines, has encouraged the continued exploitation, and
   in some cases further development, of existing machines. This approach
   has helped to control the loss of highly qualified researchers and
   contributed to enriching the knowledge and databases. A reappraisal of
   the existing machines is recommended for the future. 3.2.8 The
   Thermonuclear Fusion Programme is probably the best example of European
   Added Value within the FPs. The only other research activity within
   Europe on a similar scale is CERN. The nature and range of
   activities/expertise and the large capital investments required in the
   fusion area would limit the level of activity that could be undertaken
   within the national budgets in any individual Member State Association.
   Good co-ordination and co-operation between the Associations (16 in
   1996, but presently 20) has enabled far greater achievements to be made
   and, as mentioned above, has enabled Europe to be recognised
   internationally as leading research in this field. 3 Originally known
   as ITER-RO/RC, but referred to throughout this document as New ITER
   since the ITER Council has still to decide on a name. Designed to
   achieve a Q gain of 10 rather than ignition and 30% of the original
   power production. 10 3.2.9 The Programme requires a highly
   multidisciplinary research effort drawing on a wide range of different
   disciplines and skills, (e.g. plasma physics, engineering, mathematics,
   computing, material science..). The success of the major experiments
   and the programme over the past 5 years has been largely due to the
   co-operation achieved within the multidisciplinary, multinational teams
   responsible for the work. Likewise, the ITER design has benefited from
   the transfer of experience from the European Programme. 3.2.10 European
   industry has grown in competence together with the fusion programme and
   can provide all the manufacturing and technical support required by the
   programme. The high level of technical sophistication and exacting
   requirements of the programme in areas such as, superconductors, remote
   handling, vacuum technology, power electronics and brazing and welding,
   has enhanced the skill base found in European industry and the quality
   of standards in industry. In addition, there are a number of examples
   where industry-based technicians, working in support of the programme,
   have benefited from the specialist training they have received. Eureka
   and COST type activities are not appropriate at this stage. 3.2.11 The
   long-term research and development nature of this Programme has meant
   that there have been no significant opportunities to contribute
   directly to other Community policies. Nevertheless, the orientation of
   the European Programme (see Section 4) towards fusion power production
   could offer a long-term, clean and safe alternative for the future
   large-scale production of electricity world-wide and could contribute
   to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. There is reasonable hope
   that in-depth studies undertaken on the safety of fusion technology
   during the past 5 years will lead to a wider acceptance of this energy
   option. Hence, it offers the opportunity for major impacts on future
   European energy, environmental and urban policies. 3.2.12 In the
   short-term the programme has provided substantial social benefits. It
   has contributed to the development of a strong and competent
   scientific, technological and industrial community. During the past 5
   years, the programme has directly employed around 2000 scientists and
   engineers (including about 250 PhD students). It has directly
   contributed to Community policies on training and has the highest level
   of mobility of researchers of any European Programme at around 500
   person-months per year. At any one time, around 40-45 young researchers
   are in receipt of grants for training. In addition, the programme has
   indirectly supported a considerable number of staff in related support
   and supply industries. In many cases this has led to substantial
   developments in their specialised capabilities, personnel enhancement
   and the quality of their products. 3.3 MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS DURING THE
   PAST 5 YEARS 3.3.1 The Next Step activities have been a major focus of
   the programme, with Europe being an active participant in the
   engineering design activities for ITER together with the USA, Japan and
   Russia. The European contribution to ITER has been provided through: *
   the European Home Team 11 * participation in the Joint Central Team. In
   addition, the majority of the work undertaken at JET during the past 5
   years has been in support of ITER, together with a large proportion of
   the activities within the national research institutes. 3.3.2 Major
   achievements towards the `Next Step' during the period include: *
   Production of record fusion power at JET (>16 MW for about one second,
   and 4-5 MW for about 4 seconds, generating 22 MJ of fusion energy  see
   Figure 3) and the demonstration of alpha heating, a pre-requisite for
   the `Next Step'. * Demonstration of `Next Step' relevant technologies
   such as remote handling complex in-vessel components and closed cycle
   tritium handling. * A substantially increased level of involvement by
   European industry, both in the assessment of ITER design reports and in
   the construction of components. For example, the fabrication of a large
   niobium-tin superconducting model coil (scale 1:3) for ITER. 3.3.3 JET
   remains the most relevant machine for supporting reactor-orientated
   fusion research world-wide and is currently the only tokamak capable of
   D-T operation. The work on JET is complemented by the studies on
   concept improvement, long-term technology and safety and environment
   undertaken using the range of European fusion machines (Table 2), as
   discussed below. Together these activities have enhanced the level of
   understanding in fusion science, demonstrated a number of the key
   features of the technical design for a `Next Step' machine (Figures 4
   and 5 and Box 1) and enabled the development of a detailed and fully
   integrated design for the `Next Step' machine. The achievements of the
   European programme are well recognised world-wide. Figure 3: Fusion

   3.3.4 Following the recommendations from the previous panel, major
   effort has been dedicated to the assessment of the safety and
   environmental aspects of fusion, both in the short and long-term. The
   1995 report on the Safety and Environmental Assessment of Fusion Power
   has been updated, confirming the intrinsic safety-environment
   advantages of fusion power. In addition, the EU made a significant
   contribution to the non site specific safety report for ITER which was
   well received by the ITER Council. Two major conclusions of these
   activities are: 13 * Most severe accidents would not require any public
   evacuation assuming appropriate design provisions are made. * Almost
   all the activated material from the reactor could be cleaned or
   recycled (based on the use of presently available low activation

   Activities Next Step Activities in Physics * There is improved
   confidence in extrapolations to ITER from semi-empirical studies, in
   which dimensionless plasma quantities are kept identical (JET; ASDEX
   Upgrade, IPP; COMPASS, UKAEA), plus experiments showing clear evidence
   of alpha particle heating in JET D-T plasmas and a 25% lower additional
   heating power requirement to access the high confinement regime than in
   pure deuterium. This supports the design variants of the New-ITER
   developed by the ITER-JCT and the EFDA-CSU aimed at the lowest possible
   capital cost for a superconducting, ITER-class machine. *
   Quasi-stationary high confinement modes with a large radiated power
   fraction and good power and particle exhaust have been achieved. High
   density divertor operation and baffling the divertor have been shown to
   reduce neutral particle flux back into the main plasma chamber, with a
   clear improvement of D and He pumping (ASDEX Upgrade, IPP). * Operation
   in the high confinement "optimised shear" regime has been demonstrated
   (JET; ASDEX Upgrade, IPP; Tore Supra, CEA; FTU, ENEA), and the
   associated internal transport barrier sustained in long-pulse operation
   by plasma current profile control (Tore Supra, CEA). * A new
   operational mode for optimising plasma boundary characteristics with
   respect to radiation level and heat transfer, the "Radiative Improved"
   or RI-mode has been developed (TEXTOR-94, Etat Belge  ERM/KMS & TEC;
   ASDEX Upgrade, IPP; JET), and previously established density limits
   have been exceeded by high field side pellet injection (ASDEX Upgrade,
   IPP). * Theoretical models and codes have been developed for the study
   of: accessible operational space and regimes of Tokamaks (Conf.
   Suisse), control techniques for mitigating disruptions (UKAEA),
   improved ICRH and LHCD power coupling (TEKES), MHD effects (RISÃ). Next
   Step Activities in Plasma Engineering and Technology * Further
   development of gyrotrons as sources for ECRH has resulted in world
   record operation of a 118 GHz tube for >10 seconds at 400kW power
   output (European industry with CEA, Conf. Suisse and FZK). RF ion
   sources have been developed for positive and negative ion NBI (IPP;
   CEA; DCU), and improved launcher design has eliminated arcing on LHCD
   antennas by (CEA; ENEA; TEKES; Czech Rep.). * In order to operate
   Tokamak machines on prescribed trajectories in parameter space for
   optimised performance, hardware and real-time algorithms for feed-back
   control using online diagnostic signals have been developed (several
   National research institutes). * Better determination of plasma
   parameters has been achieved by the development of a number of new
   diagnostics, such as high-resolution Thomson scattering (FOM), a laser
   fluctuation correlation diagnostic (RISÃ), microwave scattering,
   neutron diagnostics (NFR; ENEA-CNR), reflectometers (IST), heavy ion
   beam system (IST), Li-beam edge plasma diagnostic (ÃAW; IPP),
   polarimetry (DCU), and a fast sweeping Langmuir probe (Hellenic Rep.).
   * Superconducting strand and jacketing have been manufactured for the
   ITER toroidal field model coils and the coil has been fabricated
   (industry). Full size superconducting cables have been tested in the
   SULTAN facility (CRPP). * Mock-ups (up to full size) of the first wall,
   blanket and divertor targets of ITER have been manufactured (industry),
   and divertor targets have been tested to heat flux levels in excess of
   the ITER requirement (FZJ; industry). * Full scale ITER divertor remote
   replacement/refurbishment facilities have been built and tested (ENEA
   with participation of Canadian and the Japanese Home Team), and an ITER
   first wall/blanket remote replacement facility has been built and
   tested (ENEA). An in-vessel viewing system has been designed and
   constructed (ENEA; VVT). * A tritium plant test facility has been
   realised (FZK supported by ITER Canada) and a torus exhaust cryopump
   test facility has been realised (FZK). * A major contribution has been
   made to the ITER safety assessment. 15 3.3.5 Research on alternative
   concepts and new plasma configurations and regimes is an important
   component of the European Fusion Programme. New tokamak regimes have
   been studied on several different machines in the national research
   institutes (Table 2). The results of this work tend to complement those
   obtained using JET; they explore alternative configurations and broaden
   the parameter ranges. In addition, they have facilitated the
   professional training of staff in this field. Developments on these
   machines have led to improvements on JET, and to the design of the
   `Next Step' machine (Figure 4). Major achievements using the tokamak
   machines during the past 5 years are summarised in Box 2. 3.3.6
   Research on alternative configurations is also undertaken by the
   national research institutes using a range of machines, such as
   Stellarators and Reversed Field Pinch machines (Table 2). Special
   mention should be made to the Wendelstein 7-X Stellarator, which is
   under construction and expected to come into operation in 2006. This
   represents the largest investment presently being undertaken in the
   European Programme. Although this machine does not fit exactly with the
   `Next Step' tokamak objectives, the decision to determine the potential
   of the stellarator was taken based on a number of criteria and was
   recommended in the previous 5 year assessment report. Box 2:
   Achievements in Concept Improvements and Alternative Configurations
   Concept Improvements on Tokamaks * Possible improvements in the Tokamak
   line have been demonstrated by the stability of highly elongated
   plasmas (k ~ 2.5) near operating limits (TCV, Conf. Suisse), and the
   achievement of record average beta values of 40% in a Spherical Tokamak
   configuration (START, UKAEA), followed by the completion of the
   construction of the Meg-Amp Spherical Tokamak MAST (UKAEA). Repetitive
   breakdown by current reversal has been demonstrated (ISTTOK, IST). *
   The experimental stabilisation of neo-classical tearing modes using
   ECCD and LHCD (ASDEX Upgrade, IPP; COMPASS-D, UKAEA) has been
   accompanied by the development of fundamental physics models of
   stability and transport phenomena (including so-called "first
   principle" models) into a valuable tool for understanding underlying
   physics (NFR). Alternative Configurations * The exploration of the
   Stellarator line has continued with the demonstration that the "island
   divertor" configuration in Stellarators can give access to regimes
   similar to the those in divertor Tokamaks (Wendelstein 7-AS, IPP) and
   the successful start of operation of the Heliac Stellarator TJ-II
   (CIEMAT). * The superconducting toroidal field demonstration coil for
   Wendelstein 7-X has been successfully tested (TOSKA, FZK). *
   Improvements have been made in the understanding and control of
   internal relaxation mechanisms in toroidal plasmas using the reversed
   field pinch (RFX, ENEA-CNR), while the reversed field pinch EXTRAP-T2
   (NFR) has been re-constructed to assess different regimes of shell
   stabilisation, after completion of its first programme phase. * The
   Free Electron Maser has been tested at high power (750 kW) in short
   pulses (FOM). 3.3.7 Specific work on long-term technology has been
   undertaken by the ITER European Home Team, in the National research
   institutes, at the JRC and in industry. The effort has been focused on
   3 main areas: 16 * European Blanket Project which aims at designing and
   constructing relevant tritium breeding blanket modules for testing in
   ITER * Assessment of advanced materials * Socio-economic studies. Major
   achievements during the past 5 years are summarised in Box 3. Box 3:
   Achievements in Long-term Studies * The European Blanket Project has
   been started. Two concepts are being investigated, and progress has
   been made on the critical technologies of fabrication and materials
   testing (CEA, FZK, ENEA, FOM-NRG, SCK-CEN). * A programme of
   characterisation and testing of low activation ferritic-martensic
   steels is in progress, and fabrication by European industry of a
   reduced activation ferritic-martensic steel (EUROFER 97) has been
   achieved (FZK, CEA, CRPP, ENEA, TEKES, CIEMAT, NFR, FZJ, FOM-NRG, IST,
   RISÃ). Advanced materials are being explored (ENEA, CEA, ÃAW, CRPP,
   Hellenic Rep., JRC, FOM-NRG, IST), while neutronics and nuclear
   databases are being further developed (FZK, CIEMAT, CEA, ENEA, ÃAW,
   UKAEA). * Studies of the socio-economic aspects of fusion power have
   started (CEA, IPP, CIEMAT, NFR, ENEA, FOM-NRG, FZK, FZJ, ÃAW, RISÃ,
   TEKES, UKAEA). Further details of the work of the individual national
   research institutes are provided in the series of fiche in Annex 1. 3.4
   LESSONS LEARNED 3.4.1 Many lessons have been learned from the Fusion
   Programme of which the following three of particular importance: *
   Large, long-term R&D projects require strong and constant sponsorship
   and high profile and competent leadership. In the past, the European
   Union (and some Member States) have given such sponsorship to the
   Fusion Programme and, in particular, to JET. This allowed the programme
   management to exploit the Programme very effectively. ITER, in its
   highly international configuration (which has inevitably introduced
   complications both at the strategic and management levels), seems to
   have progressively lost sponsorship, despite the excellent work done by
   the entire ITER team. The US withdrawal from ITER (1998) and the
   financial crisis in the Russian Federation have led to the requirement
   to redesign a lower cost New- ITER with less ambitious objectives.
   Moreover, international uncertainty still exists. * Such long-term,
   challenging and costly programmes, require a firm, stable and powerful
   legal framework within which to be managed. Again, the JET experience
   is meaningful and, with the obvious adaptations to the new context, a
   legal framework with greater management responsibilities coherent with
   the requirements of the Next Step will have to be adopted. 17 * The
   fusion community has always stressed the differences between fission
   and fusion in terms of safety and environmental impact, and all the
   studies done in the recent years confirm this point. Nevertheless, the
   general public still tends to view the two technologies in the same
   light. More attention is required on this issue. 3.5 RELEVANCE 3.5.1
   The FP5 objectives continue to provide a scientifically and politically
   coherent fusion programme. No changes to the objectives are considered
   necessary for the remainder of FP5. 4 Conclusions 4.1 During the last 5
   years, the programme has achieved very important results (see Section
   5), confirming fusion should now be considered as a credible option in
   the search for clean, large-scale power generation systems that are
   going to be required to provide a future sustainable energy supply.
   Nevertheless, there are still a number of important scientific,
   technological and engineering issues to be addressed before a
   commercial power plant can be realised. At least two more generations
   of machines are envisaged before building a prototype reactor and,
   based on present planning, large-scale electricity would be produced in
   around 50 years. Recent history has shown how sensitive the Programme
   is to delays in the decisions. The postponement of the construction of
   ITER has already introduced a delay of almost 10 years. 4.2 From the
   organisational and programme point of view, the last two years have
   been particularly complicated for the Fusion Programme due to the need
   for new organisational structures and framework agreements and due to
   the high level of uncertainty regarding the `Next Step'. The Board's
   impression is that, in spite of this situation, the programme has been
   well co-ordinated and efficiently run by the Commission as shown by the
   obtained results. 4.3 The European Fusion Programme has helped to place
   European science, technology and industry at the leading edge of
   development in this sector. The programme provides a good example of
   scientific development leading to the further development of industrial
   capabilities. Europe now has by itself all the required technical,
   engineering and industrial capabilities to proceed to the `Next Step'
   and take the fusion programme forward. 18 5 Programme Specific Issues
   5.1 FUTURE GLOBAL ENERGY SCENARIOS 5.1.1 Future long-term energy
   scenarios show a steady increase in world-wide energy demand driven by
   the increase in the global population and the rapid growth in energy
   consumption per capita in the developing economies. Although
   considerable savings in energy resources can be achieved by the
   development of more efficient supply and demand technologies, these
   alone are unlikely to be able to meet future requirements. Hence, it is
   essential that a full range of alternative energy options is
   investigated. 5.1.2 In parallel to the growth in demand for energy,
   there is an increasing understanding of the environmental impacts of
   energy such as the climate change impacts of the continued burning,
   globally, of finite fossil fuel resources. Consequently, the need for
   new non-polluting forms of energy is growing and substantial Community
   and national financial resources are being deployed to meet this
   challenge. Renewable energy is a reality but issues exist associated
   with its availability, location and integration into the network for
   the provision of large- scale power in major industrial cities. Nuclear
   energy, both fission and fusion, are CO2 emission-free alternative
   energy options for the provision of high energy density. Nuclear
   fission is already available but there are concerns about its safety
   and the issues associated with the disposal of long-lived radioactive
   waste. Nuclear fusion still requires further research and long-term
   development but appears to have the potential to provide a safe and
   clean alternative. Future energy demand will not be met by a single
   source but will be met by a mix of sustainable energy resources. To
   achieve this will require a long-term energy policy and a substantial
   increase in our level of knowledge. 5.2 THE DIFFERENT STEPS TOWARDS A
   FUSION REACTOR 5.2.1 The European Fusion Programme is envisaging two
   major steps before a prototype reactor, as shown in the tentative
   roadmap in Figure 6. Each step should, at least, meet the specific
   achievements listed in the figure. It is envisaged that each step in
   the development will require at least one major machine, although
   ideally more than one would be built to provide supporting studies and
   confirmatory evidence. 5.2.2 Due to the level of public concern over
   nuclear power it will also be important to demonstrate as quickly as
   possible the waste management and sustainable recycling required by
   fusion power and to demonstrate safety management. Hence, this is shown
   as a separate activity on the roadmap, scheduled for completion before
   the construction of the DEMO machine. 19 5.2.3 In addition to the major
   steps, described above, a materials research programme is necessary to
   develop higher performance, low activation materials for DEMO and
   PROTO. This is likely to require a large-scale materials test facility.
   This was recommended in the previous 5 year assessment but as yet there
   is no commitment towards its construction either at an International or
   European scale. 5.2.4 The long time-frame (Figure 6) necessitates a
   long-term, coherent R&D programme. The programme must be based on sound
   management, with well defined milestones and decision points whilst
   maintaining sufficient adaptability to enable the programme to
   accommodate future uncertainties associated with the evolutionary
   process (scientific, technical and political). 20 Figure 6: Tentative
