   The Office of the State Fire Marshal (SFM) regulates the safety of
   approximately 5,500 miles of intrastate hazardous liquid transportation
   pipelines and acts as an agent of the federal Office of Pipeline Safety
   concerning the inspection of more than 2,000 miles of interstate
   pipelines. Pipeline Safety staff inspect, test, and investigate to
   ensure compliance with all federal and state pipeline safety laws and
   regulations. All spills, ruptures, fires, or similar incidents are
   responded to immediately; all such accidents are investigated for
   cause.

   Hazardous liquid pipelines are also periodically tested for integrity
   using procedures approved by SFM. The program has been certified by the
   federal government since 1981. The SFM also maintains Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS)-based maps of all regulated pipelines and has
   been named as a state repository for pipeline data by the National
   Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS).
