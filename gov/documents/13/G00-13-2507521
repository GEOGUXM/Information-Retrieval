      Complaint Mediation Program

               Overview:

      The Complaint Mediation Program is responsible for processing all
    consumer complaints that are filed against California businesses that
   are regulated by the following bureaus: Automotive Repair, Cemetery and
   Funeral, Electronic and Appliance Repair, Home Furnishings and Thermal
              Insulation, Security and Investigative Services.

   This Program acts as a mediator between disputing parties to promote a
     mutually acceptable resolution. The mediators can propose terms to
     settle disputes, but will not dictate settlement terms. Complaints
     which reasonably appear to be a violation of the law or code may be
   referred to the Enforcement Division for possible investigation and/or
                            disciplinary action.

                     Security and Investigative Services

       The Bureau of Security and Investigative Services regulates the
     following businesses: Alarm Company Operators, Locksmiths, Private
       Investigators, Private Patrol Operators, Repossession Agencies,
   Security Guards, Firearm and Baton Training Facilities and Instructors.

                           Alarm Company Operator:

    An "alarm company operator" is any person who engages in business or
      accepts employment to install, maintain, alter, sell on premises,
         monitor, service, or who responds to burglar alarm systems.

                                 Locksmith:

   A "locksmith" is any person who engages in the business of installing,
       repairing, opening, modifying, or originating keys for locks. A
     locksmith does not include any person who only makes duplicate keys
                             from existing keys.

                            Private Investigator:

   A "private investigator" is a person who engages in business or accepts
   employment to protect persons; conduct any investigation; determine the
     cause or responsibility for fires, losses, accidents or damages to
     persons or property, or gathers information to be used in court. A
     private investigator is not a peace officer as defined by 832 Penal
                                    Code.

                          Private Patrol Operator:

      A "private patrol operator" is a company that furnishes security
      guards, bodyguards, patrolmen, or watchmen to protect persons or
                                  property.

                                Repossessor:

      A "repossessor" is any person who engages in business or accepts
   employment to locate or recover personal property registered under the
        Vehicle Code or other personal property sold under a security
                                 agreement.

                               Security Guard:

     Security guards, bodyguards, patrolmen, and watchmen are considered
       "security guards." Security guards employed by a private patrol
     operator must possess a valid security guard registration, and must
      possess a valid registration for any Bureau approved weapon while
                 acting in the capacity of a security guard.

                             In-House Security:

    A person employed exclusively and regularly by any employer, who does
    not provide contract security services for other entities or persons,
     in connection with the affairs of the employer only and where there
    exists an employer-employee relationship. Security guards employed by
     an In-House employer, who do not possess a weapon as defined in the
    Private Security Services Act, are not required to possess a security
                             guard registration.

                     Training Facility and Instructors:

        Baton and firearm training facilities, and baton and firearm
    instructors, are certified entities and persons that instruct the use
                            of approved weapons.

                         I want to file a complaint.

                        Hearing Aid Dispensers Bureau

    The Hearing Aid Dispensers Bureau licenses individuals as hearing aid
    dispensers and works to ensure that they comply with the Hearing Aid
   Dispensers Licensing Law. It is through licensure and the potential of
      suspension, revocation, or other discipline that limits licensed
   practice, that the Hearing Aid Dispensers Bureau takes steps to enforce
   the laws and regulations that pertain to hearing aid dispensers. Since
      the law does not give the Hearing Aid Dispensers Bureau statutory
    authority to establish an inspection program, most of the Hearing Aid
     Dispensers Bureau actions result from written complaints regarding
                    violations by hearing aid dispensers.

                         I want to file a complaint.
