                                      1940's colloquium with Fermi, Oppenheimer, etc.

   Director's Colloquia involve topics of interest to a broad audience and
   most generally focus on two types of subjects: talks of a policy nature
   and technical overviews. The Director makes the decision to have a
   Director's Colloquium. Speakers at these talks are usually the
   Director, Los Alamos program managers, preeminent scientists, or DOE
   officials.

   Colloquia can be requested by any Laboratory staff member. These talks
   tend to be overviews or reviews by eminent researchers or scholars.
   Talks by external speakers do not focus on the latest breakthroughs or
   works in progress, which are subjects for other forums such as group
   seminars. These constraints apply to external speakers only. The
   requirements for internal speakers are somewhat more flexible.

   Requests for a colloquium must be approved by the Colloquium Committee.
   The committee's requirements for a colloquium are that the presenter
   must be an eminent person and a good speaker, and the talk must be of
   general interest to the Laboratory. The committee uses these criteria
   to rate the relative value of each talk. Once the committee has
   approved a colloquium, it refers the talk to the Director for final
   approval.

   If you would like to request a Director's colloquium, please contact
   Socorro M. Mondragon.
