   1. General. This chapter gives a brief description of the Hydrologic
   Service Program and the authority given the National Weather Service to
   conduct the River and Flood Forecast and Warning Service program.
   Details of the management and design of the program are contained in
   WSOM Chapter E-02.

   2. Authority for Service. The authority to make river forecasts is
   documented in Department of Commerce Organization Order 10-15. This
   authority is vested in the River Forecast Centers (RFC) and those
   Weather Service Forecast Offices (WSFO) and Weather Service Offices
   (WSO) with hydrologic responsibilities as defined in their station
   program letters. The area of hydrologic service responsibility assigned
   each WSFO/WSO is called a Hydrologic Service Area (HSA). Geographical
   areas of responsibility are defined in WSOM Chapter E-03.

   3. Objectives of Service. The objectives of the Hydrologic Service
   Program are to:

           a. mitigate the loss of life and property by providing the
   Nation with timely flood warnings and forecasts;

           b. support the national economy with water resources forecast
   services;

           c. conduct the necessary research to implement and improve
   these warnings and forecasts; and

           d. provide hydrometeorological data for broad application to
   the flood warning and forecast program, water resource planning, and
   flood plain management programs.

   4. Design of Service. The Hydrologic Service Program is a field
   program. It functions through a two-echelon system of warning and
   forecast offices. One echelon of the system is the WSFO or WSO that has
   HSA responsibility for issuing warnings and forecasts to the general
   public. The second echelon is the RFC which prepares river and flood
   forecasts and other guidance for the WSFOs and WSOs and interacts with
   major water facility operators. A select number of RFC guidance
   products are made available to the public sector through the National
   Weather Service Family of Services. The WSFO/WSOs maintain a network of
   observing stations that report river stages, precipitation amounts, and
   other hydrometeorological variables as required. These reports are
   collected and relayed to the RFCs. The RFCs may also receive
   hydrometeorological data directly from other Federal, state, and local
   agencies. Forecasts prepared at the RFCs are then transmitted to the
   WSFO/WSOs for distribution to the public, to mass media, and to
   agencies responsible for flood protection and emergency response. The
   RFCs may also interact directly with water facility operators,
   providing them with forecasts for river operations.
