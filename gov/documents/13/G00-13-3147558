       kidney dialysis.

     * Families transitioning from CalWORKs to employment (Transitional
       Medi-Cal).
     * Qualified low income Medicare recipients (Medicare Savings
       Programs).

     HOW TO APPLY FOR MEDI-CAL

     Complete a Medi-Cal application form and return it, along with
     required verification, in person or by mail to the Social Services
     Agency district office serving the applicantâ€™s city. District
     offices are located in the white pages phone book under County
     Government. Forms may be picked up or requested by phone from the
     district office.  An assigned Eligibility Technician will assist the
     applicant by making sure all forms have been completed and
     identifying the required verifications that must be provided. In
     some situations, Medi-Cal can be requested for the three months
     preceding the application month. The same application process is
     followed.

     HOW DOES A PERSON QUALIFY FOR MEDI-CAL?
     * Person must fall into one of the eligible categories listed above.
     * Assets (bank accounts, vehicles, etc.) must fall within the
       Medi-Cal limits listed below. The limitation is based on family
       size. Assets are waived for pregnant women and children if their
       income falls within certain Federal Poverty Level (FPL) limits. A
       married person with a spouse in long term care is allowed to retain
       a higher amount of assets ($87,000 for the year 2001).


       1 person - $2,000
       2 persons - $3,000
       3 persons - $3,150
       4 persons - $3,300

                         5 persons - $3,450
                         6 persons - $3,600
                         7 persons - $3,750
                         8 persons - $3,900
                                               9 persons - $4,050
                                           10 or more persons - $4,200

     * Income is used to determine whether the person/family receives free
       Medi-Cal or has to pay part of their monthly medical expenses,
       called a Share of Cost (SOC), before Medi-Cal will begin to pay.
       The SOC is determined by subtracting an amount set by the State,
       called a Maintenance Need, from the net non-exempt income.
       Maintenance Need amounts used for some categories are:


   1 person - $ 600
   2 persons - $ 750
   2 adults - $ 934
   3 persons - $ 934
   4 persons - $1,100
   5 persons - $1,259

   6 persons - $1,417
   7 persons - $1,550
   8 persons - $1,692
   9 persons - $1,825
   10persons - $1,959
   Add $14 for each additional person

   Long Term Care - $35 per person

     * Federal Poverty Level limits are used to determine income
       eligibility for other categories. These figures change in April of
       every year.
     * All assets and income must be reported. However, some items may be
       exempt and will not be counted in determining eligibility or Share
       of Cost.
     * To be eligible for full scope Medi-Cal benefits, a person must be a
       United States citizen or a legal permanent resident. Undocumented
       immigrants are limited to restricted benefits that cover emergency
       and pregnancy related services only.
     * The applicant will receive written notice of the eligibility
       determination.

     WHAT IF A PERSON DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR MEDI-CAL ?

     Adults, age 21 through 64 years of age, with limited resources, who
     do not qualify for Medi-Cal but have a medical need, may apply for
     medical care under the Orange County Medical Services for Indigents
     (MSI) Program. The applicant must be a US citizen or have legal
     permanent resident status. There is an income limit, based on family
     size, of 200 % of the Federal Poverty Level ($1432 for 1 person as
     of 4/01). MSI benefits are available from physicians, dentists,
     community clinics and contracting hospitals that accept MSI
     patients. Not all medical services are covered. For additional
     information, contact MSI Eligibility Information at (714) 480-6333.

     HOW ARE MEDI-CAL SERVICES RECEIVED?

     If eligible, a person receives a Benefits Identification Card (BIC).
     In Orange County most beneficiaries receive their medical services
     through the CalOPTIMA system, either under a health plan or
     CalOPTIMA Direct.
