     Selected To Serve - A Guide to Jury Service


       This guide is divided into three sections.

       Section I - How Jury Service Operates answers questions about being
       called to jury service and arrangements that need to be made to
       perform that service.

       Section II - The Jury Selection process explains the jury selection
       process.

       Section III - The Trial Process answers questions about how jurors
       play their role during the trial itself.
         _______________________________________________________________

       Section I. How Jury Service Operates

       How was I chosen?

       Your name was chosen at random from drivers license and voter
       registration lists. Questionnaires are sent to the people whose
       names emerge from the random selection. Court personnel review the
       completed questionnaires to make sure that the minimum juror
       qualifications relating to age, citizenship, residency, etc., are
       met.

       How frequently might I have to serve?

       By law, you can be required to participate in jury service only once
       every two years. You will not be required to attend court for
       possible jury service more than five days, except as necessary to
       complete service in a particular trial.

       What if my boss doesnt want me to serve?

       The law makes clear that you must be excused from your job for jury
       service. You cannot be fired or demoted in any way for performing
       this public duty.

       Will I be paid for jury service?

       Current Utah law sets the compensation level for jurors at $18.50
       for the first  day and $49 for each subsequent day of service. Some
       employers are willing to pay their workers at the normal rate during
       jury service, and the workers then turn the state compensation
       amount over to the employer. The court will pay .25 a mile, one way,
       for mileage of those who must travel over 52 miles from home to the
       court facility.

       Can I be excused from jury service?

       Judges can excuse people who show that they have a physical or
       mental disability that renders them incapable of jury service.
       Judges can also grant a postponement of jury service when they
       decide that such service would result in great hardship or
       inconvenience. But these postponements are rare. Everyone is
       inconvenienced to some degree by jury service, but for the system to
       work, people from all walks of life must be willing to serve. Those
       who refuse to complete the juror questionnaire or to appear when
       called to serve are subject to the imposition of fines and jail
       time.

       Once I qualify for jury service, how long am I eligible for it?

       The length of terms for jury service vary depending on your judicial
       district. You are eligible for only one month in Third District
       (Salt Lake area). But in more rural districts, with a smaller
       population base from which to select jurors, terms of eligibility
       can last as long as six months.

       What happens after I am determined to be qualified for jury service?

       Sometime during the term of eligibility you are likely to be
       notified by the court that you are "on call" for jury service during
       the next week. The court will let you know how to keep in touch.
       Some courts have a call-in system, where potential jurors check in
       each evening to see if they will be needed at the courthouse the
       next day.

       You need to let your employer/teachers know when you are "on call"
       for jury service. But you shouldn't take time off from work or
       school until you have actually been instructed to come to the
       courthouse. The court cannot issue a letter stating that you have
       served on a jury if you were never called.

       How do I prepare for jury service?

       Be sure to arrive at the courthouse on time. A latecomer can hold up
       a trial involving scores of people. Instructions from the court will
       tell you where to park and where to report in the building. Wear
       appropriate attire. Most courts prohibit shorts or tank tops.

       Who do I call if I have more questions?

       The court will list a number on the jury service notice that you can
       call for additional information.

         _______________________________________________________________

       II. The Jury Selection Process

       What determines whether or not I serve on a jury?

       Once you arrive at the courthouse, you will be led to a jury
       assembly room. Sometimes a case will settle out of court right
       before a trial is scheduled. For these or other reasons you might
       not be needed for the jury pool after all. When this happens, you
       will be dismissed for the day.

       Those of you assigned to a trial that is going forward will be
       escorted to the courtroom where the trial is taking place, and the
       selection process will begin. First, the judge will make a short
       statement describing the case, and identifying the parties to the
       case and their lawyers. During this process, the judge, and
       sometimes the counsel for each side, will ask you questions, which
       you are required to answer truthfully. The questions asked are aimed
       at finding out if any panel members have a personal interest in the
       case or if there is some other reason why they could not render an
       impartial verdict.

       Why are potential jurors sometimes asked personal questions during
       the juror selection process?

       In some cases, you may be asked questions about your background that
       make you uncomfortable. The court does not wish to invade your
       privacy. But it is sometimes necessary for the court to know these
       facts to ensure a fair trial. If you are uncomfortable about
       answering a question, you can request to discuss it with the judge
       privately in chambers (in his or her office).

       What are "Challenges?"

       The process through which a lawyer for either side asks that a panel
       member be excused is called a "challenge." There are two types of
       challenges:

       Challenges for cause Here the lawyer claims on the basis of
       information provided by the panel member that he or she might not be
       able to render an impartial verdict. An example of a challenge for
       cause might be one in which a lawyer asks to excuse a panel member
       from serving during an auto theft trial since the jurors car had
       been stolen just the week before. The judge will grant challenges
       for cause if he or she agrees with the lawyers argument that
       impartiality might be threatened. There is no limit to the number of
       challenges for cause which either party can make.

       Peremptory challenges Each side has a limited number of challenges
       for which no reason need be given. These peremptory challenges give
       both sides some choice in the make-up of the jury.

       At the end of the selection process, those in the panel who have
       been "challenged" will be excused, and those remaining will be sworn
       in as jurors.

       Does failure to be chosen for a jury mean I did something wrong in
       the selection process?

       Not at all. The fact that a person is not chosen for a jury panel is
       no reflection whatsoever on that persons integrity or worthiness to
       serve. People not chosen for one panel will often find themselves
       chosen for another.

       III. The Trial Process

       Will I have to be sequestered away from my family during a long
       trial?

       Long trials are rare. Most last only one or two days. Juries are
       very seldom sequestered. Years go by with not one jury in the state
       being sequestered. The courts cannot guarantee that the trial wont
       be long, or that you wont be sequestered, but both events are
       unlikely.

       Whats the difference between a criminal and a civil case?

       Criminal In a criminal case a person called the defendant is charged
       with a violation of the law. The attorney representing the state or
       local government is called the prosecutor (or sometimes the city,
       county, or district attorney.)

       In criminal cases the judge will inform the jury about the law, and
       the jury must decide if the defendant has broken that law. Criminal
       verdicts in Utah must be unanimous. In criminal cases, the
       prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant
       committed the crime.

       Prior to the criminal trial, the defendant will have appeared before
       the judge to plead guilty or not guilty to the criminal charges.
       This hearing before the judge is called an arraignment.

       Civil Civil cases involve disputes (usually about money) which the
       parties havent been able to solve between themselves, and have
       turned to the court system to resolve. The person bringing the
       complaint in a civil suit is called the plaintiff. The one defending
       him or herself against the complaint is the defendant.

       In a civil case, the jury is asked to determine which side is
       favored by the preponderance of evidence. Civil jury decisions can
       be made by a three-fourths majority of jurors. A unanimous verdict
       is not required, as it is in a criminal trial.

       What is my most important job as a juror?

       As a juror, your major job is that of fact finder. You must listen
       carefully for the facts presented as evidence by each side, and use
       your life experience and common sense to make a judgment. It is very
       important to keep an open mind while all the evidence is being
       presented. Making your mind up early in the trial, before all the
       evidence is in, could result in a failure to reach a fair and just
       verdict.

       How is a trial conducted?

       1. The trial usually begins with opening statements from each side.
       These are summaries reviewing what each side intends to prove during
       its presentation of the case. Note that these statements are not
       evidence.

       2. Each side presents its case, with witnesses and other evidence.
       Witnesses called by either side are subject to cross examination by
       the other side.

       3. The judge delivers instructions to the jury regarding the
       relevant law.

       4. The prosecution (or plaintiff) and defense present closing
       arguments. The prosecution (plaintiff) then presents a rebuttal of
       the points made by the defense.

       5. The jury retires to deliberate.

       6. The jury reaches and announces its verdict.

       What is happening when a lawyer "objects" to a question asked by the
       other side?

       Throughout the trial, the judge may be asked to decide questions of
       law. Usually these questions concern objections to testimony that
       one side wants to present. By law, it is the judges job to decide
       such questions. A ruling by the judge does not indicate that he or
       she is taking sides. The judge is just determining that the law does
       or does not permit that question to be asked.

       Why will the jurors sometimes be asked to leave while the judge
       talks to the lawyers?

       Sometimes the judge will ask jurors to leave the room while lawyers
       make arguments for and against admission of a particular piece of
       evidence or on some other point of law. Jurors are asked not to
       speculate about what was discussed, but instead to base their
       reasoning only on what is presented to them.

       At what point can I discuss the trial with others?

       It is important that you not discuss the trial with anyone (even
       fellow jurors) until the jury is sent out to deliberate. In a
       multi-day trial you must not discuss the case with family members,
       friends, or anyone else. If someone approaches you in the courthouse
       or elsewhere and tries to discuss the trial with you, leave
       immediately, and report the incident to the court (the judge). The
       bailiff will deliver any written messages you wish to convey to the
       judge.

       Jurors must make their decision on the basis of the evidence
       presented at the trial, and not on the basis of any outside
       information about the case. For this reason jurors are prohibited
       from reading, watching, or listening to any media accounts of the
       trial, and from visiting the crime scene themselves or trying to
       discover any information about the crime scene on their own.

       What Happens During Deliberations?

       At the beginning of deliberations, you will be asked to select a
       chair person. It is that persons job to preside over the
       deliberations and give each jury member a chance to express his or
       her views.

       You should enter the discussion with an open mind and freely
       exchange views. You shouldnt hesitate to change your opinion if the
       deliberations convince you that they were wrong initially. You are
       obligated to reach a verdict whenever possible. But no juror is
       required to give up any opinion which he or she is convinced is
       correct.

       What Happens After Jury Service is Completed?

       After you return to the courtroom and announce your verdict, the
       judge will formally dismiss you from jury service. You may then
       freely discuss the case, but you are not required to discuss the
       case with anyone. One or more of the lawyers in the case may want to
       discuss the verdict or the deliberations with you. You may talk to
       them if you wish, but are under no obligation to do so.

       Might I be able to evaluate the performance of my judge?

       At the end of some trials, jurors will be asked to complete a
       questionnaire evaluating the performance of their judge. These
       questionnaires are part of the Judicial Performance evaluation
       program, aimed at improving the administration of justice in Utah.

       This outline  contains general guidelines to jury service. In your
       particular district, procedures might be somewhat different. Jury
       service procedures will be explained by the judge or jury service
       personnel at your court.
