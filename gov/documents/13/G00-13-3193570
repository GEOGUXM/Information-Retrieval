   NIAP PARTICIPATES IN JAPAN'S INAUGURAL COMMON CRITERIA SCHEME DEVELOPMENT
   PROJECT

   On March 16^th 2001, the National Information Assurance Partnership
   participated in an important milestone in Japan's ongoing effort to
   build a Common Criteria Testing Program. Dr. Ron Ross, NIAP Director,
   delivered the keynote address to 500 Japanese government and business
   executives at a seminar hosted by the Information-Technology Promotion
   Agency (IPA). The seminar, conducted at the Tokyo International Forum
   and Convention Center, highlighted the new international IT security
   standard, ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria), and marked the beginning of
   a full-scale effort by the Japanese government to develop a Common
   Criteria Evaluation and Certification Scheme. The Ministry of Economy,
   Trade, and Industry, the Japanese government sponsor of the project,
   hopes to become a member of the international Common Criteria
   Recognition Arrangement in 2003.
