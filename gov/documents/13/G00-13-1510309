   Mission
          The NIH mission is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to
          better health for everyone. NIH works toward that mission by:
          conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the
          research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical
          schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the
          country and abroad; helping in the training of research
          investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical
          information.
