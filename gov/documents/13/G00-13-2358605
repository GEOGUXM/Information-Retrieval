     As part of the Earth and Space Sciences (ESS) Project, within NASA's
     High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Program, JPL's
     High Performance Computing Group works to identify and develop
     parallel techniques and algorithms for the effective solution of
     computational problems encountered by the Grand Challenge Teams.
