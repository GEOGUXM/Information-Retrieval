       Blue bullet Project Life Cycle Back to top of page


   The EBT Project life cycle will consist of three main phases: Design,
   Development, and Implementation.  The design and development phases of
   the project apply to the design and development of the EBT system and
   the standard eligibility system interfaces.  The implementation phase
   applies to the implementation of the EBT system to all counties.  The
   Implementation Phase consists of three phases for each individual
   county:  County Readiness, Planning and Installation, and County
   Implementation.

   The Design and Development Phases will be completed ten months after
   contract award.   The Implementation Phase begins with the deployment
   of the system in the pilot county (Alameda) and ends with the
   conversion of the final case in the last county implemented.


       Blue bullet Statewide County Implementation Approach Back to top of
   page
         Recognizing the size and complexity of a California statewide EBT
   implementation, the State developed an implementation approach that
   divides EBT implementation into manageable pieces while maintaining an
   emphasis on rapid rollout of EBT to all California counties.  The
   proposed implementation approach provides:
     * Geographic coordination of county EBT implementations;
     * Coordination with Statewide Automated Welfare System (SAWS)
       eligibility system implementations;
     * Development, testing and piloting of SAWS eligibility system
       interfaces to EBT; and
     * Support of county implementation readiness and planning activities.


       Blue bullet EBT Implementation Regions and Waves Back to top of
   page


   Each of the California counties has been assigned to an EBT
   implementation region as depicted in the EBT Implementation Regions
   map.
     * The Los Angeles County region (Region 1) consists of 35 district
       offices.
     * The Northern California region (Region 2) consists of 20 ISAWS
       counties.
     * The Central California region (Region 3) consists of 13 ISAWS
       counties, 5 WCDS counties and 2 C-IV counties.
     * The Southern California region (Region 4) consists of 2 ISAWS
       counties, 4 WCDS counties and 1 C-IV county.
     * The Central Coast region (Region 5) consists of 8 WCDS counties
       including Alameda, the selected project pilot county.

   The preliminary statewide implementation schedule consists of fifty-six
   county EBT implementations coordinated within the region in which they
   reside.

       Blue bullet County Implementation Schedules and Methodology Back to
   top of page
         A preliminary statewide implementation schedule has been
   developed but is not yet finalized. With assistance from the State and
   counties, the EBT Contractor will establish the final implementation
   schedule and county implementation dates following contract award.  An
   important consideration in developing the final schedule will be the
   status of the SAWS eligibility system implementations.  Changes in the
   SAWS implementation schedules may impact the order and timing of county
   implementations in the statewide implementation schedule.

   The preliminary statewide implementation schedule provides a maximum of
   ten months for implementation of EBT in each county except for Los
   Angeles County which is seventeen months.  The county implementations
   are divided into three county implementation phases: 1) County
   Readiness; 2) Planning & Installation; and 3) Implementation.

       Blue bullet County Readiness (begins seven months before case
   conversion) Back to top of page
         The objective of the Readiness Phase is to ensure that counties
   are prepared to successfully complete planning and installation within
   the allotted timeframes.

   During the County Readiness Phase (maximum of two months), the State
   implementation team assists counties with the organization of county
   implementation teams and the setting of county priorities, selection of
   county options, and establishment of county-specific EBT policies.  The
   EBT Contractor assists counties with the identification of financial
   interface requirements. External stakeholders (including impacted
   county departments, retailers, organizations serving or representing
   recipients, and financial institutions) are identified, contacted and
   organized.

       Blue bullet Planning & Installation (five months before case
   conversion) Back to top of page


   The objective of the Planning and Installation Phase is for the county
   to make and implement all operational, technical and logistical
   decisions and prepare all county and training sites for EBT equipment
   to ensure efficient conversion and ongoing issuance of EBT benefits,
   and for the EBT Contractor to complete all required equipment
   installation, conversion testing, interface testing, and staff
   training.

   During the county Planning and Installation Phase (maximum of five
   months), the Contractor has prime responsibility for the implementation
   of EBT and in a cooperative effort with the counties will:
     * Plan for the implementation of EBT;
     * Develop and test financial system interfaces;
     * Identify and ready locations for EBT equipment;
     * Install EBT equipment;
     * Develop strategies and procedures for card issuance, PIN selection,
       benefit conversion, benefit reconciliation, card reconciliation,
       cash settlement processing, staff training, recipient training and
       contingency processing;
     * Locate, procure and setup training facilities; and
     * Complete retailer recruitment, training and equipment installation.


       Blue bullet Implementation Back to top of page


   The objective of the Implementation Phase is to convert and reconcile
   all appropriate benefit records to the EBT system, issue cards and
   provide training to recipients, implement ongoing issuance processes
   and procedures, and to settle and reconcile new and ongoing benefits
   through the EBT system.

   During the county Implementation Phase (maximum of five months for Los
   Angeles County and three months for all other counties), the Contractor
   has prime responsibility for the implementation of EBT and in a
   cooperative effort with the counties will:
     * Implement EBT operational processes and procedures;
     * Issue cards to recipients;
     * Train recipients;
     * Assist recipients with PIN selection;
     * Convert benefits to EBT;
     * Issue all new and ongoing benefits through EBT; and
     * Implement benefit reconciliation and cash settlement processes.
