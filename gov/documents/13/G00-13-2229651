   "There is no one definition of a good death; quality end-of-life care
   is a dynamic process that is negotiated and renegotiated among
   patients, families, and health care professionals; a process moderated
   by individual values, knowledge, and preferences for care." JAMA 2000;
   284:2476-2482.
