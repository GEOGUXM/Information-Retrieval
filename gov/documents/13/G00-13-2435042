   What Does Thinking Green Mean?

   Thinking Green is all about keeping our Earth green and healthy. It is
   also about asking us all to protect and care for the natural wonders
   and treasures of the Earth. We need everyone's help and the time to
   begin is now!

                                                             [kids_10.jpg]

     * Now is the time to make a promise to work together to take care of
       the home we all share here on Earth.
     * Now is the time to work to keep our planet green by protecting the
       plant life on our planet.

   A planet that has healthy trees, plants and water will be a good place
   for animals, birds, insects and you to live.

     * Did you know that trees, forests and green spaces filter polluted
       runoff, making our water safer and cleaner?
     * Did you know that trees clean the air and return pure oxygen,
       helping us all to breathe easier?
     * Did you know that trees, forests and green spaces shelter and
       nourish wildlife- from bears to bald eagles, and salmon to
       salamanders.

   We hope you will find information on this web site that will help you
   learn more about your environment.

       and trees that live there now.

       your community who want to start planting projects. [kids_15.jpg]

       already live in your community.

       school garden or planting a tree or adopting a tree.

       around you
