   Technical Assistance Guide
       Guide to Training and Technical Assistance at OJP
       Technical Assistance and Training at OJP is the product of many
       conversations between the program offices and the field. A wide
       range of funding sources, types of services, and products are
       covered by this heading. No single source of information about
       training or technical assistance is available. Instead this page
       collects links to all the sources of training with a sprinkling of
       advice thrown in.
