   Welcome to the Center for Monitoring Research (CMR) sponsored by the
   Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) of the Department of Defense.

   The CMR supports a wide range of efforts in the area of nuclear
   explosion monitoring through in-house research and development, and
   contractor support. Seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasonic, and
   radionuclide technologies are all utilized in the effort to monitor the
   globe for nuclear explosions.

   The CMR technical staff includes scientists, software engineers,
   computer technicians, and database experts. Their expertise, which
   ranges from data collection, analysis, and distribution to basic
   research and development, contributes to the various projects of the
   CMR.

   The CMR Research and Development Support System project is focussed on
   improving the verification monitoring capability by supporting the DTRA
   R&D community, providing testing at appropriate scales for evaluating
   current and future capability, and focusing attention on the important
   technical issues.

   The CMR hosts the Prototype International Data Centre (PIDC) as it is
   being developed and delivered to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
   Treaty Organization (CTBTO) International Data Centre (IDC) in Vienna,
   Austria. The data obtained and products generated while the PIDC
   operated as the pricipal data collection and distribution center for
   the developing system are available through this site.
