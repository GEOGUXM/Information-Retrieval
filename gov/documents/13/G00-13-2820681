Evolution

   The evolution of "Capaciflector" technology can be traced by acquiring
   copies of the following U.S. patents:

     J.M. Vranish, R. McConnell. Driven - Shield Capacitive Sensor, U.S.
     patent 5,166,679. Nov. 24, 1992. This constituted the initial work
     on "Capaciflector" and enabled a capacitive sensor to get very large
     sensing ranges while mounted to a conductive fixture/object.
     Designed for Space robotics collision avoidance, this property is
     useful in many applications.

     J. M. Vranish, W. Rahim. Phase-Discriminating Capacitive Array
     Sensor System, U.S. patent 5,214,388. May 25, 1993. This constituted
     the initial effort to extend "Capaciflector" techniques beyond
     collision avoidance single sensors to an array of sensors in close
     proximity to each other which could be driven by a single oscillator
     and operate without mutual interference. It was, primarily an
     electrical circuits approach.

     J. M. Vranish. "Capaciflector" Camera, U.S. patent 5,373,245.
     December 13, 1994. This extended the work in "Capaciflector" arrays.
     It included both sensor geometry, fields and construction
     techniques, and new analog circuit techniques. The sensor arrays
     were flat area types (both flexible and rigid) and the analog
     circuit techniques were a simplification over Phase-Discriminating
     Capacitive Array Sensor System. The sensor arrays and circuits were
     built and tested with great success.

     J. M. Vranish. Double-Driven Shield "Capaciflector" Sensor, U.S.
     patent 5,442347. August 15, 1995. The new analog circuitry, while
     very effective and simple, had a slight range reduction penalty.
     This invention was an attempt to recover that range. It turns out
     the range loss is insignificant. Still, this technique is good for
     special "niche" applications.

     J. M. Vranish. Current-Measuring Operational Amplifier Circuits ,
     U.S. patent 5,515,001. May 7, 1996. The new analog circuitry used in
     "Capaciflector" Camera had numerous applications beyond
     "Capaciflector" Camera and, so was detailed in a separate patent.
     This work also went into more details on the unique circuitry used
     in "Capaciflector" arrays, cameras, and single sensors.

     J. M. Vranish. Capaciflector-Guided Mechanisms, U.S. patent
     5,539292. July 23, 1996. This work explored the possibilities and
     advantages of using "Capaciflector" elements to perform dual sensing
     and mechanical functions in a "Smart Tool" configuration. This work
     was very successful for precision robotic assembly in space.

     J. M. Vranish. 3-D "Capaciflector', U.S. patent 5,726,581. March 10,
     1998. This work detailed the sensor configuration aspects of 3-D
     "Capaciflectors". It extended and made more general, the work in
     Capaciflector - Guided Mechanisms.

     Charles E. Campbell. Frequency scanning capaciflector for
     capacitively determining the material properties, U.S. patent
     5,521,515. May 28, 1996. A capaciflector sensor system scanned in
     frequency is used to detect the permittivity of the material of an
     object being sensed.
