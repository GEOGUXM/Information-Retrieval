   UPDATE
   January 24, 2002

   Senator Kerry successfully included several key provisions of the
   American Small Business Emergency Relief and Recovery Act in the 2002
   Defense Appropriations Bill, which was recently signed into law.

   Although Senator Kerry intends to continue his fight to pass S.1499,
   held hostage by two Republicans, the following provisions included in
   the Defense Appropriations Bill by Kerry will deliver emergency
   assistance to small businesses adversely affected by the events of
   Sept. 11 and their aftermath:

     * Appropriates $150 million in additional funding to the SBA to cope
       with the disaster -- $75 million of which will go toward making
       7(a) guaranteed loans for disaster victims.
     * Nonprofits and nondepository financial institutions will now be
       able to apply for disaster loans.
     * Gives the SBA administrator discretion to raise the size standards
       of small businesses to reflect inflation or a small business'
       proximity to high-cost areas.
     * Extends the deferral of payment of interest and principal on
       disaster loans from one year to two years and prohibits the accrual
       of interest during the deferral period.
     * Raises the ceiling on the maximum amount a small business can
       borrow from the $1.5 million to $10 million.
     * Decreases the annual 7(a) guaranteed lending by half.
