           Welcome to the FUSE Guest Investigator Program Homepage

   The FUSE Science and Data Workshop will take place at Johns Hopkins
   University during 20-22 March 2002. Here is the Call for Abstracts and
   further information.

     FUSE is back in business! FUSE science operations were temporarily
    suspended on 2001 December 10 because two reaction wheels, which are
     used to control the spacecraft attitude, were no longer functional.
   Since that time, the spacecraft manufacturer and FUSE project personnel
   have been working around the clock to restore science operations. Those
     efforts have been successful; on 25 January 2002 FUSE obtained its
    first spectrum of an astronomical target since December 10th. Further
    testing will take place during the month of February, and we hope to
    resume science operations on March 1st. More information is available
        in this message from the FUSE PI and NASA Project Scientist.

     Regular updates on FUSE's status will be posted at the Current FUSE
     Mission Status website at the FUSE Science Center at Johns Hopkins
                                 University.
