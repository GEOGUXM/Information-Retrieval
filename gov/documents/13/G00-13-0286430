                Multiple Unit Large Volume Filtration System

   deployment during the Canadian Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (C-JGOFS)

   deployed from the afterdeck of the J.P. Tully during the Febuary 1996
   C-JGOFS expedition along Line P to Station Papa The people from left to

   The MULVFS has 12 pump/filtration units, each capable of filtering up
   to 16,000 L of seawater through a filter series consisting of 53 um
   polyester mesh and a pair of 1 um quartz fiber filters. Each of the
   pumps also processes 2500 L through adsorber cartridges designed to
   trap dissolved natural uranium series radionuclides (particularly
   Th-234/U-238) present in seawater. Another flow channel allows
   processing of 100-200 L through specialized adsorber/filter
   combinations. The 12 light-weight/low-drag pumps are operated
   simultaneously in profile from the surface to 1000 m depths using
   ship-generated 440VAC 3-phase power. This is accomplished via an
   uniquely engineered 1000 m long electromecanical cable and cable
   handling system. Depth and flowrate information is transmitted in real
   time from several pump units during operation. Typical station time is
   9 hours including deployment and recovery. Operations require 2 people
   at sea. The system is designed to be tolerant of winter time
   conditions.
