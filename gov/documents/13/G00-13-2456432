   Welcome to NOAA's Coral Reef online. Here you can find a wealth of
   information about coral reefs, the rain forests of the sea. Dive in and
   see nature's treasures in the ocean.

   Why should we care about coral reefs? Coral reefs are important to our
   future.

   Reefs are:

     home and nursery for almost a million fish and other species, many
   that we rely on for food;

     some of the Earth's most diverse living ecosystems;

     full of new and undiscovered biomedical resources that we've only
   just begun to explore;

     important protection for coastal communities from storms, wave damage
   and erosion.
