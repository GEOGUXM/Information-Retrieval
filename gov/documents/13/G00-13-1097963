     __________________________________________________________________

   The Federal Executive Boards were established in 1961 by Executive
   Memorandum. Since then, all subsequent administrations have supported
   FEBs and additional boards have been authorized. Today, there are
   twenty-eight FEBs serving major metropolitan areas across the nation.
   The Chicago FEB was established in 1961 and serves as the Federal
   presence in the six county Chicago metropolitan area.

   Membership is limited to the most senior official of each Executive
   agency in the area. Full Board meetings are held quarterly. Senior
   officials and/or their deputies are encouraged to attend these
   meetings. Currently, the Chicago FEB has approximately 150 member
   agencies and serves approximately 60,000 Federal employees.

   The FEB is headed by a Chair, Vice Chair, and Secretary/Treasurer
   elected by the membership. In addition, there is an Executive Committee
   of ten elected members. Former Chairs of the FEB continue to serve as
   Ex-Officio members. The Executive Committee meets monthly and is
   responsible for outlining the focus and policies of the FEB and its
   committees each year. In addition, it makes recommendations on matters
   involving interagency coordination and action.

   The Executive Director of the FEB serves as the principal staff
   assistant to the FEB Chair and provides a full range of staff services.
   The position does not represent an individual agency as do other
   members of the Board, but rather the Federal community as a whole.

   The FEB supports and promotes national initiatives of the President and
   the Administration and responds to local needs of Federal
   departments/agencies and the community through program activities of
   its committees and councils. Memberships on these committees include
   Federal employees who have been selected by their agency head to serve
   because of a keen interest in the goals and objectives of the activity.
   Regular attendance at the meetings and activities is expected.
