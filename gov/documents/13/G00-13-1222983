   Recommendation Fully Endorsed by FESAC August 2, 2001 3. The US Fusion
   Energy Sciences Program should establish a proactive US plan on burning
   plasma experiments and should not assume a default position of waiting
   to see what the international community may or may not do regarding the
   construction of a burning plasma experiment. If the opportunity for
   international collaboration occurs, the US should be ready to act and
   take advantage of it, but should not be dependent upon it. The US
   should implement a plan as follows to proceed towards construction of a
   burning plasma experiment: * Hold a "Snowmass" workshop in the summer,
   2002 for the critical scientific and technological examination of
   proposed burning plasma experimental designs and to provide crucial
   community input and endorsement to the planning activities undertaken
   by FESAC. Specifically, the workshop should determine which of the
   specific burning plasma options are technically viable, but should not
   select among them. The workshop would further confirm that a critical
   mass of fusion scientists believe that the time to proceed is now and
   not some undefined time in the future. * Carry out a uniform technical
   assessment led by the NSO program of each of the burning plasma
   experimental options for input into the Snowmass summer study. *
   Request the Director of the Office of Energy Sciences to charge FESAC
   with the mission of forming an "action" panel in Spring, 2002 to select
   among the technically viable burning plasma experimental options. The
   selected option should be communicated to the Director of the Office of
   Science by January, 2003. * Initiate a review by a National Research
   Council panel in Spring, 2002, with the goal of determining the
   desirability as well as the scientific and technological credibility of
   the burning plasma experiment design by Fall, 2003. This is consistent
   with a submission of a report by DOE to congress no later than July,
   2004. * Initiate an outreach effort coordinated by FESAC (or an ad-hoc
   body) to establish an appreciation and support for a burning plasma
   experiment from science and energy policy makers, the broader
   scientific community, environmentalists and the general public. This
   effort should begin now. How to Proceed with BP Experiment: Two

   Japan, and Russia: takes one large step towards Alternate Configuration

   AND PROGRESS IN FIELD HAVE ADDRESSED SOME OF THEIR SPECIFIC TECHNICAL
   CONCERNS, BUT CORE CONCERN REMAINS: INTEGRATED "ITER-LIKE" STEP IS
   PREMATURE AND ILL-SIZED. * WISH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE FUSION PROGRAM
   WILL LISTEN TO EACH OTHER AND PARTICIPATE IN THE FESAC PROCESS TO REACH
   COMMUNITY CONSENSUS ON BEST WAY FOR US PROCEED: THEN WORK TOGETHER TAKE
   THIS IMPORTANT BURNING PLASMA STEP. Columbia University
