Factsheet Highlight
ATP Funding for Energy Research

   The experience of higher gas prices and California's energy problems in
   2000 and 2001 has raised awareness of the need for inexpensive and
   accessible energy sources. The ATP has been investing in energy-related
   technologies for many years.

     * In FY 2000, a total of 35 energy-related projects were part of
       ATP's portfolio:

     * Thirteen projects were awarded in FY 2000
     * Seven projects were awarded in FY 1999
     * Fifteen projects were awarded in FY 1997-98.



   ATP outlays in FY 2000 for these 35 projects totaled $30 million,
   representing slightly more than 20% of ATP funding for all ongoing
   projects in FY 2000.

     Of the $30 million, the allocation among ATP energy-related projects
   is:
     * Oil and gas: 36%
     * Batteries and supercapacitors: 27%
     * Energy conservation: 13%
     * Wind and solar: 11%
     * Fuel cells: 10%
     * Motors and generators: 4%

   Allocation among ATP energy-related projects

   ATP's mission is to accelerate the development of innovative
   technologies for broad national economic benefits through partnerships
   with the private sector. The ATP is supporting energy-related projects
   that, if successful, will increase the availability of energy sources
   and are expected to be enabling or to spill over to other organizations
   within and across industries and the economy.

ATP and the States

Highlights from Reinforcing Interactions Between the Advanced Technology
Program and State Technology Programs: Volume 1: A Guide to State Business
Assistance Programs for New Technology Creation and Commercialization, Marsha
R.B. Schachtel and Maryann P. Feldman.

ATP Partnerships with States Lead to:

Leveraging

     * Every state has programs to support new business enterprises, but
       few states provide direct funding for the development of high-risk
       technology R&D. The ATP provides R&D funding to support development
       of high-risk technology.
     * States and ATP funding complement each other, resulting in
       additional investment from the private sector.
     * The ATP has received applications from 49 states and made awards in
       40 states plus the District of Columbia.

Collaboration

     * In 1996, the ATP signed an agreement with the Science and
       Technology Council of the States. They agreed to cooperate in
       outreach, technical and business assistance to applicants, and to
       facilitate the formation of joint ventures.
     * One-third of ATP projects are joint ventures.

Economic Clusters

     * Location, near a cluster of resources such as universities and
       other firms, is critical in the development of both a new
       technology and a firm.
     * The ATP promotes regional clustering by fostering cross-state
       collaboration.

University Involvement

     * Universities are involved in more than half of ATP projects.

Factsheet Highlight
ATP Supports Small Businesses

Small businesses^(1) represent a large portion of proposals received by ATP

     * They submit three out of four proposals (3,464 out of 4,636).

     * Small businesses are the majority of ATP award recipients (61%)^(2)
     * Three out of five awards go to small businesses (355 of the 581
       awards), totaling $86 million in ATP support cost-shared by the
       private sector.
     * 290 awards ($523 million) are to small businesses, single-company
       projects.
     * 65 ($345 million) awards are to joint venture projects that are led
       by small businesses.

     Three out of four of the 581 projects funded to date involve at least
   one small business as a participant (425 out of 581).

     A total of 557 small businesses participate directly in ATP projects
   as members of joint ventures and hundreds more participant as
   subcontractors.

     50 of the 59 awards (85%) made in the 2001 competition were led by a
   small business.



   Small businesses, located across 41 states, participate in ATP
   projects.

   2001.

Factsheet Highlight
ATP and University Participation

42 Competitions: 1990-September 2001
(Analysis based on active and completed projects)

Universities play an important role in ATP projects

   University participation brings frontier research knowledge and ideas
   to ATP projects, and provides critical access to the expertise of key
   university personnel.

     * Over half of ATP-funded projects involve university participation.
       More than 160 different universities represent about 503 instances
       of university participation in ATP projects.
     * Universities have received an estimated $140M through ATP grants
       (almost 10 percent of total ATP funds).

   Universities can participate in ATP projects either as subcontractors
   or as partners in a joint venture. Most, nine out of ten, universities
   participate as subcontractors.

   One example of how universities are crucial to ATP projects, and how
   ATP is critical to university-based technology, is the spin-offs of
   university technology found in ATP projects. See, for example,
   "Diffusion Pathways for Photonics Technologies," presentation given by
   Todd Watkins and Theodore Schlie.

   Many start-up companies involved in ATP projects are the result of a
   spin-off of technology originally developed at a university or
   non-profit institution. The greatest number of these spin-offs is in
   the biotechnology area.

   Recent data indicate ATP has provided critical support to university
   and non-profit spin-off companies in the following areas ^(1):
     * Biotechnology: 37
     * Electronics: 11
     * Chemistry and materials: 7
     * Information technology: 6

   These 61 ATP projects represent $135M in ATP-award funding.

   of other non-profit organizations in ATP, visit our website:
