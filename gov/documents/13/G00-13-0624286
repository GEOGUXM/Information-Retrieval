   Budget

   OFM performs an ongoing role in the planning, analysis, and
       implementation of the state's operating and capital budgets. It has
       the primary responsibility for making budget recommendations to the
       Governor and presenting the Governor's budget proposal to the
       Legislature and the public. After budgets are approved by the
       Legislature, OFM monitors state agency activities for conformance
       with executive and legislative intent.
