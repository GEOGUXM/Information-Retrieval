   fixed-target experiments advance the sensitivity frontier. Both have
   great discovery potential. * Today's physics influences tomorrow's

   subpanel recommendation: The Subpanel recommends that SLAC continue R&D
   with Japan's KEK toward a common design for an electron-positron linear
   collider with a luminosity of at least 1034 cm-2 s-1 and an initial
   capability of 1 TeV in the center of mass, extendible to 1.5 TeV. The
   Subpanel recommends that SLAC be authorized to produce a Conceptual
   Design Report for this machine in close collaboration with KEK. This is
   not a recommendation to proceed with construction. A decision on
   whether to construct a linear collider should only follow the
   recommendation of a future subpanel convened after the CDR is complete.
   The decision will depend on what is known about the technology of
   linear colliders and other potential facilities, costs, international
   support, and advances in our physics understanding. My belief: The US
   (and worldwide) HEP community will decide within five years whether to
   proceed with a linear collider-on its own, and not in competition with
   any other machine. This decision must be based on an informed
   assessment of the scientific opportunities, technical risk, and cost.
   Building an inadequate machine "because we need a project" would be
   calamitous. W&C C. Quigg, "Physics Opportunities in Fermilab's Futures"
   24 45 We cannot stand apart * Only informed opinions will carry any
   weight. * We have the standing to check claims about physics and
   accelerator science. Example: How long does it take to carry out the
   physics menu of a 500-GeV linear collider? * The entire community must
   define the Right Linear Collider. * Much physics is in common with the
   physics of a muon collider. (Profit from LC studies, learn what it
   takes to compete.) * Fermilab is a possible site for a linear collider
   at the energy frontier. http://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/lc/local/
   systems/Conventional%20Facilities/compare.htm * We can build bridges to
   users, and to other labs. W&C C. Quigg, "Physics Opportunities in

   36 45 Observations on the FMC * The various machines discussed as the
   First Muon Collider all are luminosity poor. The interesting-and
   unique-program that has been outlined for a Higgs factory would be a
   far more compelling prospect if it could be carried out over a few
   years, rather than a decade. * A program that includes many collider
   rings dedicated to specific studies: a Higgs factory, a top factory, a
   1 -TeV collider, etc., appears very rich. We have to keep 2 in mind the
   realities of the muon economy: not all elements of a multiring complex
   will operate at once. * Even modest polarization can be highly useful,
   especially if it can be controlled flexibly, and separately for µ+ and
   µ-. It is an advantage if polarization can be reversed on demand. *
   Single-muon-ring devices do not seem to lack intensity. The
   capabilities of the intense neutrino beams produced in the decays of
   stored leptons appear very well matched to the demands of the physics.
   W&C C. Quigg, "Physics Opportunities in Fermilab's Futures" 37 45
   Gilman subpanel recommendation: The Subpanel recommends that an
   expanded program of R&D be carried out on a muon collider, involving
   both simulation and experiments. This R&D program should have central
   project management, involve both laboratory and university groups, and
   have the aim of resolving the question of whether this machine is
   feasible to build and operate for exploring the high-energy frontier.
   The scale and progress of this R&D program should be subject to
   additional review in about two years. European interest: * Report to
   ECFA, "Prospective Study of Muon Storage Rings in Europe" *
   CERNSPSC/98-30, "Physics Opportunities at a CERN-based Neutrino
   Factory" My belief: The muon collider path needs a plausible first step
   that is rich in physics. If a neutrino source can be built by the time
   the LHC turns on, it could offer a diverse program of experiments,
   including a broad assault on neutrino mass and mixing-without
   committing us to the muon collider as our machine on the energy
   frontier. W&C C. Quigg, "Physics Opportunities in Fermilab's Futures"

   Cost reduction essential to go beyond SSC Example pp machine: s = 100
   TeV, L = 1034 cm-2 s-1 ¶ Explore magnet alternatives * superferric (2
   teslas) "transmission line" * moderate field (7  8 teslas) a la LHC *
   high field ( 10 teslas) * very high field (14  15 teslas) * high-Tc
   superconductors for dipoles or specials ¶ Encourage appropriate
   conductor R & D ¶ Look for limitations to accelerator performance a la
   1979 ICFA Report ¶ Optimize cost of machine: technical + conventional
   components ¶ Aim at a set of reference designs (but not too soon) Be
   aware of evolving physics goals and energy /luminosity tradeoffs for
   detectors W&C C. Quigg, "Physics Opportunities in Fermilab's Futures"
   44 45 Inventing Fermilab's Futures * Commission the Main Injector and
   make the '99 fixed-target run a success. * Get on with Run II. * Define
   Run III and make an early commitment to it. * Make CMS a success. Keep
   the energy frontier at Fermilab metaphorically, if not geographically.
   * Help define the Right e+e- linear collider. * Understand the
   feasibility of a µ+µ- collider. Explore muon storage rings as intense
   neutrino sources. * Develop the technologies for a hadron collider
   beyond the LHC. W&C C. Quigg, "Physics Opportunities in Fermilab's
