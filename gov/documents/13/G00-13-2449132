           Global Change Master Directory Releases Version 8 - MD8

   The Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) is pleased to announce the
   release of the Version 8 software (MD8). The directory now holds more
   than 10,100 descriptions of Earth and environmental science data, with
   information on how to obtain the data and/or direct links to data
   sources. The individual data set descriptions (Directory Interchange
   Format files - DIFs) have been contributed by over 1300 data centers,
   government agencies, universities, research institutions, and private
   researchers around the world. The directory is also available at
   international sites through the Committee on Earth Observation
   Satellites' (CEOS) International Directory Network (IDN).

   MD8 is now completely written in Java and supports XML document types.
   The MD8 software incorporates two format changes approved through the
   CEOS Interoperability Forum:
   (1) Data_Set_Citation modifications for clarity and compatibility with
       future ISO meta-data standard (ISO 19115/TC 211) recommendations;
       (2) IDN_Node field modification to permit multiple entries.

   This latest version now offers:
   New Home Page Design.
       New site map and search tools for easier navigation of the web
       site.
       A "User Connection" option for better communications with the GCMD

       XML.
       New "builder" authoring tools for data sets (DIFs) and services

       data set or service description.
       A new and improved Science Keyword Interface with capabilities for
       multiple refinements, refinement counts, customization,
       cross-linking, etc.
       Internal XML-based Query Language to support richer sets of
       queries.
