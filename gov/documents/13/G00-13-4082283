What is Aeronautics?

   Aeronautics is the science of flight. Aeronautics is the method of
   designing an airplane or other flying machine. There are four basic
   areas that aeronautical engineers must understand in order to be able
   to design planes. To design a plane, engineers must understand all of
   these elements.

   1. Aerodynamics is the study of how air flows around the airplane. By
   studying the way air flows around the plane the engineers can define
   the shape of the plane. The wings, the tail and the main body
   (fuselage) of the plane all affect the way the air will move around the
   plane.

   2. Propulsion is the study of how to design an engine that will provide
   the thrust that is needed for a plane to take off and fly through the
   air. The engine provides the power for the airplane. The study of
   propulsion is how the engineers determine the right kinds of engine and
   the right amount of power that a plane will need

   3. Materials and Structures is the study of what materials are to be
   used on the plane and in the engine and how those materials make the
   plane strong enough to fly effectively. The choice of materials that
   are used to make the fuselage wings, tail and engine will affect the
   strength and stability of the plane. Most airplane materials are now
   made out of composites, materials that are stronger and more
   lightweight than most metals.

   4. Stability and Control is the study of how to control the speed,
   direction, altitude and other conditions that affect how a plane flies.
   The engineers' design the controls that are needed in order to fly and
   instruments are provided for the pilot in the cockpit of the plane. The
   pilot uses these instruments to control the stability of the plane
   during flight.

How does an engine work?

   All jet engines, which are often called, gas turbines, work on the
   principle that a tremendous thrust is required to drive the plane
   forward. The engine sucks air in at the front. The inlet and fan pull
   the air in. The compressor, raises the pressure of the air. The
   compressed air is then sprayed with fuel and the mixture is lit by an
   electric spark. The burning gases expand and blast out through the back
   of the engine. As the jets of gas shoot backward, the nozzle releases
   the air and gas mixture and the engine and the aircraft are thrust
   forward. Jet engines drive aircraft forward with great force.

What is Thrust?

   Thrust is the force propelling the airplane forward. The airplane's
   engine is used to cause the forward thrust. The engine does this by
   producing exhaust gases that rush out of the back of the engine. Issac
   Newton's Third Law of Motion says that every action has an equal and
   opposite reaction. That means that the backward force of the jet engine
   pushes the plane forward.

What are the parts of the turbofan engine?

                        Major Parts of the Jet Engine

   Fan - The fan is the first component in a turbofan. The fan pulls air
   into the engine. The large spinning fan sucks in large quantities of
   air. It then, speeds the air up and splits it into two parts. One part
   continues through the "core" or center of the engine, where it is acted
   upon by the other engine components. The second part "bypasses" the
   core of the engine, instead traveling through a duct that surrounds the
   core to the back of the engine where it produces much of the force that
   propels the airplane forward.

   Compressor - The compressor is the first component in the engine core.
   The compressor squeezes the air that enters it into smaller areas,
   resulting in an increase in the air pressure. This results in an
   increase in the energy potential of the air. The squashed air is forced
   into the combustion chamber.

   Combustor - In the combustor the air is mixed with fuel and then
   ignited. This process results in high temperature, high energy airflow.
   The fuel burns with the oxygen in the compressed air, producing hot
   expanding gases.

   Turbine - The high energy airflow coming out of the combustor goes into
   the turbine, causing the turbine blades to rotate. This rotation
   extracts some energy from the high-energy flow that is used to drive
   the fan and the compressor. The gases produced in the combustion
   chamber move through the turbine and spin its blades. The task of a
   turbine is to convert gas energy into mechanical work to drive the
   compressor.

   Nozzle - The nozzle is the exhaust duct of the engine. The energy
   depleted airflow that passed the turbine, in addition to the colder air
   that bypassed the engine core, produces a force when exiting the nozzle
   that acts to propel the engine, and therefore the airplane, forward.
   The combination of the hot air and the cold air are expelled and
   produce an exhaust which causes a forward thrust. The nozzle may be
   preceded by a mixer, which combines the high temperature air coming
   from the engine core with the lower temperature air that was bypassed
   in the fan. This results in a quieter engine than if the mixer was not
   present.

   Afterburner - In addition to the basic components of a gas turbine
   engine, one other process is occasionally employed to increase the
   thrust of a given engine. Afterburning (or reheat) is a method of
   augmenting the basic thrust of an engine to improve the aircraft
   takeoff, climb and (for military aircraft) combat performance.
   Afterburning consists of the introduction and burning of raw fuel
   between the engine turbine and the jet pipe propelling nozzle,
   utilizing the unburned oxygen in the exhaust gas to support combustion.
   The increase in the temperature of the exhaust gas increases the
   velocity of the jet leaving the propelling nozzle and therefore
   increases the engine thrust. This increased thrust could be obtained by
   the use of a larger engine, but this would increase the weigh and
   overall fuel consumption.

A Short History of Turbine Engines

   150 BC - An Egypian philosopher and mathematician, Hero, invented a toy
   (Aeolipile) that rotated on top of a boiling pot of water. This caused
   a reaction effect of hot air or steam that moved several nozzles
   arranged on a wheel. This works when one understands the Third Law of
   Motion - Every action produces a reaction ... equal in force and
   opposite in direction.

   1232 - Chinese began to use rockets as weapons. The invention of gun
   powder uses the reaction principle to move rockets foward.

   1500 - Leonardo da Vinci drew a sketch of a device, the chimney jack,
   that rotated due to the effect of hot gases flowing up a chimney. It
   looked like a device that used hot air to rotate a spit. The hot air
   came from the fire and rose upward to pass through a series of fanlike
   blades that turned the roasting spit.

   1629 - Giovanni Branca developed a stamping mill, that used jets of
   steam to rotate a turbine that then, rotated to operate machinery.

   1678 - Ferdinand Verbiest built a model carriage that used a steam jet
   for power.
   1687 - Sir Issac Newton announces the three laws of motion. These form
   the basis for modern propulsion theory.
    1. Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that
       state of motion unless an external force is applied to it.
    2. The relationship between an object's mass m, its acceleration a,
       and the applied force F is F = ma. Acceleration and force are
       vectors in this law the direction of the force vector is the same
       as the direction of the acceleration vector.
    3. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

   1791 - John Barber received the first patent for a basic turbine
   engine. His design was planned to use as a method of propelling the
   'horseless carriage'. The turbine was designed with a chain-driven,
   reciporcating ype of compressor. It has a compressor, a combustion
   chamber, and a turbine.

   1872 - Dr. F. Stolze designed the first true gas turbine engine. His
   engine used a multistage turbine section and a flow compressor. This
   engine never ran under its own power.

   1897 - Sir Charles Parson patented a steam turbine was used to power a
   ship.

   1914 - Charles Curtis filed the first application for a gas turbine
   engine.

   1918 - General Electric company started a gas turbine division. Dr.
   Stanford A. Moss developed the GE turbosupercharger engine during
   W.W.I. It used hot exhaust gasses from a reciprocating engine to drive
   a turbine wheel that in turn drove a centrifugal compressor used for
   supercharging.

   1920 - Dr. A. A. Griffith developed a theory of turbine design based on
   gas flow past airfoils rather than through passages.

   1930 - Sir Frank Whittle in England patented a design for a gas turbine
   for jet propoulsion. The first successful use of this engine was in
   April, 1937. His early work on the theory of gas propulsion was based
   on the contributions of most of the earlier pioneers of this field.

   The specifications of the first jet engine were:
     * Airflow = 25 pounds/sec
     * Fuel Consumption = 200/gal/h or 1300 lb/h
     * Thrust = 1000 lb
     * Specific Fule consumption = 1300/1000 = 1.3 lb/lb/h

   1936 - At the same time as Frank Whittle was working in Great Britain,
   Hans von Ohian and Max Hahn, students in Germany developed and patented
   their own engine design.

   1939 (August) - The aircraft company Ernst Heinkel Aircraft flew the
   first flight of a gas turbine jet, the HE178.

   1941 - Sir Frank Whittle designed the first successful turbojet
   airplane, the Gloster Meteor, flown over Great Britain. Whittle
   improved his jet engine during the war, and in 1942 he shipped an
   engine prototype to General Electric in the United States. America's
   first jet plane was built the following year.

   1942 - Dr. Franz Anslem developed the axial-flow turbojet, Junkers Jumo
   004, used in the Messerschmitt Me 262, the world's first operational
   jet fighter.

   After W.W.II the development of jet engines was directed by a number of
   commercial companies. Jet engines soon became the most popular method
   of powering the airplanes.

Types of Jet Engines

Turbojets

   The basic idea of the turbojet engine is simple. Air taken in from an
   opening in the front of the engine is compressed to 3 to 12 times its
   original pressure in a centrifugal or axial compressor. Fuel is added
   to the air and burned in a combustion chamber to raise the temperature
   of the fluid mixture to about 1,100°F to 1,300° F. The resulting hot
   air is passed through a turbine, which drives the compressor. If the
   turbine and compressor are efficient, the pressure at the turbine
   discharge will be nearly twice the atmospheric pressure, and this
   excess pressure is sent to the nozzle to produce a high-velocity stream
   of gas which produces a thrust. Substantial increases in thrust can be
   obtained by employing an afterburner. It is a second combustion chamber
   positioned after the turbine and before the nozzle.The afterburner
   increases the temperature of the gas ahead of the nozzle. The result of
   this increase in temperature is an increase of about 40 percent in
   thrust at takeoff and a much larger percentage at high speeds once the
   plane is in the air.

   The turbojet engine is called a reaction engine. In a reaction engine,
   expanding gases push hard against the front of the engine. The turbojet
   sucks in air and compresses or squeezes it. The gases flow through the
   turbine and make it spin. These gases bounce back and shoot our of the
   rear of the exhaust, pushing the plane forward.

                         Picture of Turbojet Engine

                         Picture of Turbojet Engine

Turboprops

   A turboprop engine is a jet engine attached to a propellor. The turbine
   at the back is turned by the hot gases, and this turns a shaft that
   drives the propellor. Some small airliners and transport aircraft are
   powered by turboprops.

   Like the turbojet, the turboprop engine consists of a compressor,
   combustion chamber, and turbine, the air and gas pressure is used to
   run the turbine, which then creates power to drive the compressor.
   Compared with a turbojet engine, the turboprop has better propulsion
   efficiency at flight speeds below about 500 miles per hour. Modern
   turboprop engines are equipped with propellers that have a smaller
   diameter but a larger number of blades for efficient operation at much
   higher flight speeds. To accommodate the higher rotative and flight
   speeds, the blades are scimitar-shaped with swept-back leading edges at
   the blade tips. Engines featuring such propellers are called propfans.

                         Picture of Turboprop Engine

                         Picture of turboprop engine

Turbofans

   A turbofan engine has a large fan at the front, which sucks in air.
   Most of the air flows around the outside of the engine, making it
   quieter and giving more thrust at low speeds. Most of today's airliners
   are powered by turbofans. In a turbojet all the air entering the intake
   passes through the gas generator, which is composed of the compressor,
   combustion chamber, and turbine. In a turbofan engine only a portion of
   the incoming air goes into the combustion chamber. The remainder passes
   through a fan, or low-pressure compressor, and is ejected directly as a
   "cold" jet or mixed with the gas-generator exhaust to produce a "hot"
   jet. The objective of this sort of bypass system is to increase thrust
   without increasing fuel consumption. It achieves this by increasing the
   total air-mass flow and reducing the velocity within the same total
   energy supply.

                         Picture of Turbofan Engine

                         Picture of Turbofan Engine

  Turboshafts

   This is another form of gas-turbine engine that operates much like a
   turboprop system. It does not drive a propellor. Instead, it provides
   power for a helicopter rotor. The turboshaft engine is designed so that
   the speed of the helicopter rotor is independent of the rotating speed
   of the gas generator. This permits the rotor speed to be kept constant
   even when the speed of the generator is varied to modulate the amount
   of power produced.


                        Picture of Turboshaft Engine

                        Picture of Turboshaft Engine

  Ramjets

   The most simple jet engine has no moving parts. The speed of the jet
   "rams" or forces air into the engine. It is essentially a turbojet in
   which rotating machinery has been omitted. Its application is
   restricted by the fact that its compression ratio depends wholly on
   forward speed. The ramjet develops no static thrust and very little
   thrust in general below the speed of sound. As a consequence, a ramjet
   vehicle requires some form of assisted takeoff, such as another
   aircraft. It has been used primarily in guided-missile systems. Space
   vehicles use this type of jet.
