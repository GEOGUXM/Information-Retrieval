     Directions

   The VA Outpatient Clinic at Fort Ethan Allen in Colchester, VT
   (formerly Appletree Bay in Burlington) moved to new expanded space on
   September 29, 2000. The new clinic space (approximately double the
   previous size) will serve the primary health care needs of eligible
   veterans in the greater Colchester/Burlington, VT area. Most of the
   cost of services provided to veterans enrolling in the plan will be
   paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

   SERVICES:

   Services provided and arranged for through the Clinic
     * Primary care physicians
     * Laboratory Tests
     * Preventive services such as annual flu and pneumonia shots
     * Electrocardiograms (EKG)
     * X-rays
     * Medications

   ADVANTAGES
     * Veterans will have one primary care doctor to coordinate care on an
       ongoing basis.
     * Veterans can receive primary medical care closer to home and don't
       have to travel to the White River Junction VAM&ROC.
     * Veterans will still be eligible for specialty outpatient care,
       inpatient care and all other entitlements through the White River
       Junction VAM&ROC.
