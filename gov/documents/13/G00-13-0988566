   In order to more easily evaluate sediment contaminated with toxic
   chemicals, we have established some guidelines to determine ecological
   risk. These guidelines, based on different evaluation methods, help us
   to decide whether a certain amount of toxic chemicals (level of
   toxicity) is likely to harm the ecosystem. (The following pages contain
   information available in PDF format.)

   Utility of AVS/EqP in Hazardous Waste Site Evaluations A discussion of
