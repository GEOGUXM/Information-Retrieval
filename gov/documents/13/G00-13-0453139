     Space Station airlock manager set his sights on the stars as a boy

     As a boy growing up in Fairhope, Ala., Todd May gazed at the stars
     and dreamed of space exploration.

     Ive loved space as long as I can remember, said May. When I was just
     five, I remember climbing on the roof of my grandfathers house on
     Fort Morgan Road in Gulf Shores to watch a lunar eclipse. From then
     on, I was hooked.

     Today, May leads the team that built a doorway to the stars  a new
     airlock that is making it easier to exit the International Space
     Station for Extravehicular Activities, also known as EVAs and space
     walks. On July 20, May and his team watched as astronauts Michael
     Gernhardt and James Reilly conducted the first space walk from the
     Station using the new Quest Airlock   manufactured at NASAs
     Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.

     I felt a real rush of emotion when I saw Mike stick his head out of
     the airlock hatch for the first time, said May, airlock element
     manager in Marshalls Flight Project Directorate. It was like our
     team scoring the winning touchdown.

     The Quest Airlock makes it easier for crews to perform space walks,
     and allows both Russian and American spacesuits to be worn when the
     Shuttle is not docked with the Space Station. American suits will
     not fit through Russian airlocks at the Station.

     I knew our team had done its best to prepare the Quest Airlock for a
     safe flight, said May. Once we got the high-pressure oxygen lines
     safely filled, our engineers working in the control center breathed
     a sigh of relief. We knew the airlock was ready for its debut space
     walk.
     The new robot arm, delivered to the Station in April, was used to
     pick up the airlock from the Space Shuttle Atlantis cargo bay and
     attach it to Unity, a node or passageway that connects to Destiny,
     the U.S. laboratory module. During the STS-104 mission, while the
     Shuttle was docked with the Station, astronauts performed three
     space walks to complete airlock installation and activation.May and
     his team supported the flight activities from the Payload Operations
     Center located at Marshall and the Mission Control Center at NASAs
     Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas

     To build and test the airlock before its delivery to the Station,
     May worked with a team involving more than 12 contractors from two
     countries, as well as three NASA centers  Marshall, Johnson, and
     Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The Boeing Company, the Space
     Station prime contractor, built the 6.5-ton (5.8 metric ton) airlock
     and several other key Station components in the same Marshall
     building where the Saturn V rocket was built that carried people to
     the Moon.

      Its was a tremendous pleasure to watch the NASA and Boeing team
     transform an empty shell into a flight-worthy component of the Space
     Station, said May.

     The Joint Airlock Module is spindle-shaped, consisting of two
     cylindrical, pressurized chambers. It is 18 feet (5.49 meters) long
     and has a diameter of 13 feet (3.96 meters). Inside the large
     chamber attached directly to the Unity node, astronauts from every
     participating nation can suit up for space walks to assemble the
     Station, perform maintenance or install experiments.

      In the large chamber, several crew members don suits and perform
     other activities to prepare for extravehicular activities.  Just
     before the start of a space walk, crew members close a hatch and
     move to the smaller part of the airlock. Here, pressure is reduced,
     so the crew can safely go outside and work in the vacuum of a space.

      Communications and acoustics testing, thermal and structural
     analysis and mechanical evaluation and testing, and safety are just
     a few of the areas Marshall team members have supported, said May.
     Marshall also provided manufacturing facilities and performed
     program-critical tasks.

     Graduating from Auburn University in 1990 with a bachelors degree in
     materials engineering, May started his career at NASA in 1991 as an
     engineer at the Marshall Centers Materials and Processes Laboratory,
     leading work on the Space Station module.  Then, he worked at NASAs
     Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, leading a team that
     evaluated materials and processes used for the Space Station. Later
     he became deputy manager of the team working with Russia on the
     Space Station.

     In 1998, May returned to Alabama to lead the team constructing the
     airlock. May his wife Kelly and their three children, Carson,
     Madison, and Harrison, reside in Huntsville.
