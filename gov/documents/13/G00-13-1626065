   The Surgeon Generals Report on Women and Smoking was released on March
   27, 2001. This report is a comprehensive summary of everything that is
   known about women and smoking in our country. It examines past and
   current efforts to reduce tobacco use among women. Most importantly, it
   gives a direction to what is needed in the future to more effectively
   help women stop smoking. The chapters thoroughly outline smoking
   trends, health consequences, cessation programs, and research on women
   and smoking.

   Women and Smoking
   Women have not always smoked. At the beginning of the century, women
   rarely smoked because it was socially unacceptable. Not surprisingly,
   lung cancer and chronic pulmonary disease were rare among women. Today,
   22 million smokers in the U.S. are women, and there has been a rapid
   increase in the number of womens deaths related to lung cancer and
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Smoking prevalence is highest
   among women with less than a high school education. Although smoking
   among women of reproductive age declined from 29% to 27% from
   1987-1992, tobacco use among adolescents increased in the 1990s.
   Alarmingly, a 1999 survey found that almost 35% of high school girls
   smoke.

   Smoking Rates

   U.S. ethnic groups. Since 1978, the smoking rate (31%) among American
   Indian and Alaska Native women of reproductive age remains strikingly
   high  almost 10% higher than in other ethnic groups. Smoking among
   African American, Asian American, Pacific Islander, and Hispanic women
   of reproductive age has decreased since that time. Asian American and
   Hispanic women have the lowest prevalence of smoking (roughly 12% and
   14%). African American women and White women smoke at similar rates
   (roughly 23%). However, African Americans currently bear the greatest
   health burden of disease risk due to smoking. And although African
   American teens have the lowest rates of smoking among their peers, they
   still suffer the same disproportionate effects of smoking on their
   health.

   Fast Facts
     * Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the United
       States.
     * In 1999, approximately 165,000 women died prematurely from
       smoking-related diseases, like cancer and heart disease.
     * In 2001 lung cancer will kill nearly 68,000 U.S. women.
     * Twenty-two million of the smokers in this country are women.
     * At least 1.5 million adolescent girls in the U.S. smoke cigarettes,
       and every day, nearly another 3,000 young people under the age of
       18 become regular smokers.
     * Unlike so many other conditions or diseases, everyone has the power
       to prevent themselves from suffering from smoking-related illnesses
       or death. The benefits of not smoking start within days of
       quitting.
