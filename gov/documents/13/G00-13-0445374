                                        Office of General Counsel
     __________________________________________________________________

          Office of the Chief Counsel for Technology Administration
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Office of the Chief Counsel for Technology provides legal counsel
   and guidance to the Technology Administration (TA) of the United States
   Department of Commerce. The Office serves as counsel for intellectual
   property law (patent, trademark and copyright) for the Department,
   including the obtaining of patents and trademarks and the licensing
   thereof. We also handle claims and suites relating to infringement of
   intellectual property. The Technology Administration works to maximize
   the contribution that technology makes to Americas economic growth.
   The Technology Administration includes three agencies, the Office of
   Technology Policy, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
   and the National Technical Information Service.

   The Office of the Chief Counsel for TA is managed by a Chief Counsel.
   The Chief Counsel is assisted by a Deputy Chief Counsel, Michael Rubin,
   who is currently acting as Chief Counsel, and a staff of five attorneys
   and two support staff. The Deputy Chief Counsel and three staff
   attorneys maintain an on-site legal office at the National Institute of
   Standards and Technology. The Chief Counsel also maintains a part time
   on-site legal office at the National Technical Information Service.

   The duties and responsibilities of the Office of the Chief Counsel are
   best explained by understanding the duties and responsibilities of the
   Technology Administration. The Undersecretary for Technology is the
   Department of Commerces principle technology advisor to the Secretary
   and is the spokesperson for science and technology matters managed by
   the Department. The TAs responsibilities include working closely with
   business, Federal agencies, state and local units and other public and
   private organizations. The TA also manages a variety of technology
   programs relating to technology policy, as well as performing generic
   and pre-competitive research and development of advanced, cutting edge
   technologies. Through its varied activities, TA is able to provide
   industry with a wide range of services aimed at enhancing its ability
   to commercialize new technologies an to increase the productivity and
   quality of U.S. products and services.

   The Technology Administration has responsibility for transferring
   certain Government technologies to the private sector. Two main
   statutes govern these responsibilities: The Bayh Dole Act and the
   Federal Technology Transfer Act. These statutes allow Federal financial
   and technical assistance incentives to be given to various private
   sector and public entities to find and develop commercial uses for
   Federally developed technology.

     * The Bayh Dole Act authorizes certain recipients of Government
     contracts, grants and cooperative agreements to retain title to
     inventions made in the course of that work. The TA is responsible
     for issuing Government-wide regulations implementing the Act.

     * The Federal Technology Transfer Act gives Federal laboratories
     authority to enter into cooperative research and development
     agreements with private entities. Ownership rights in expected
     resultant technology may be agreed to in advance. The Act also
     authorizes the payment of royalties to Government agencies and
     employees for inventions made and licensed during the course of
     their work.

   The three agencies managed by the TA have distinct functions in helping
   the Department of Commerce fulfill its broad mission.

     * The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) assists
     industry in the development of technology and procedures needed to
     improve quality and to modernize manufacturing processes and aids
     U.S. industry through research and development services. NIST also
     develops, maintains and retains custody of the national standard and
     measurements. NIST has a staff of more than 3000 scientists and
     support personnel plus some 1200 visiting researchers. NIST
     accomplishes its mission through various intramural and extramural
     programs. NIST conducts research in Electronics and Electrical
     Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering, Chemical Science and
     Technology, Physics, Materials Science and Engineering, Building and
     Fire Research, Computer Systems, and Applied Mathematics and
     Scientific Computing. Some of NISTs extramural programs include the
     Advanced Technology Program, a competitive cost-sharing program
     designed to assist United States industry pursue high-risk, enabling
     technologies with significant commercial potential, and the
     Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a nationwide network of
     organizations to support U.S. manufacturers in increasing their
     competitiveness through ongoing technological advancement. NIST also
     manages the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, the U.S.
     standard of quality achievement and improvement in domestic
     industry.

     * The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) serves as a
     clearinghouse for the collection and dissemination of non-classified
     scientific, technical and engineering information. NTIS also serves
     as a permanent archival repository for information collected from
     many sources, including domestic and foreign government
     laboratories, universities and non-profit institutions. NTIS
     operates a variety of programs and services to carry out its
     clearinghouse activities.

     * The Office of Technology Policy (OTP) is TAs principle source of
     technology policy advice and analysis. It provides the expertise
     necessary to support senior Department officials in their capacity
     as members of technology policy groups. The OTP also manages a
     number of technology programs and is responsible for coordinating
     international science and technology policy issues within the
     Department.

   The Office of the Chief Counsel for Technology Administration plays a
   critical role in the management of the Technology Administration. Staff
   attorneys work closely with clients from the three agencies they serve.
   Their duties include providing counsel regarding program authority,
   providing advice on U.S. laws and treaties, preparing formal legal
   opinions, reviewing and drafting contracts, licenses, MOUs,
   confidentiality and research agreements, reviewing and drafting
   regulations, working closely with government and private sector
   counsel, and so on.
