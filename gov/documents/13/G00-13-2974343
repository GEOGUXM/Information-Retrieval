   Due to computer problems, model verification maps will not be available
   until an undetermined future date. We apologize for the inconvenience.

   List of observed model biases

   The Interactive Model Biases page requires a frames-capable browser,
   with JavaScript enabled. It is recommended that you have a screen
   resolution of at least 1024x768 pixels, though you can still view the
   page at lower resolutions.

   For those browsers that cannot support frames and/or Javascript, we
   also have a text interface to the model biases images. Height,
   Temperature, Relative Humidity, and Wind Speed biases are available at
   the 250, 500, 700, 850, and 1000 mb levels. Sea Level Pressure (SLP)
   and Precipitable Water (PW) biases are also available. Select the link
   below for the desired parameter and domain:
     * Height & SLP biases: [North America] [South America] [Europe]
     * Temperature biases: [North America] [South America] [Europe]
     * Relative Humidity & PW biases: [North America] [South America]
       [Europe]
     * Wind Speed biases: [North America] [South America] [Europe]

   The following links provide information on numerical model performance
   for both the long and short range periods from other sources.
   Information includes models produced by the National Weather Service
   (Eta, NGM, AVN, MRF), as well as other models produced worldwide
   (NOGAPS, ECMWF, UKMET, Canadian, etc...)
