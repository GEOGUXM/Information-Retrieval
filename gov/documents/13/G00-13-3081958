   Abridged Rules
    1. SWIMMING PROHIBITED IN EVERGREEN LAKE- Structures exist under the
       water which can cause serious injury. i.e. fencing, trees,
       concrete, glass, etc.
    2. ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ARE PROHIBITED- McLean County wishes to provide
       a family atmosphere which can be interfered with by intoxicating
       beverages.
    3. UNLEASHED PETS ARE PROHIBITED- Roaming pets disturb other people
       and wildlife.
    4. VEHICLES ARE PROHIBITED ON GRASS- Vehicles not only cause
       depressions in wet turf, they cause compaction on dry turf which
       leads to truf destruction. Exhaust systems are extremely hot and
       can cause damage to turf, too.
    5. EVERGREEN LAKE WATERCRAFT REGISTRATIONS ARE REQUIRED- Local
       government facilities DO NOT receive funds generated by state
       registrations and must have this revenue to maintain docks,
       launches, roads, parking lots, restrooms, lake safety patrols,
       shoreline control, etc.
    6. TEN (10) HORSEPOWER MOTOR LIMIT ON EVERGREEN LAKE- McLean County
       wishes to offer an atmosphere undisturbed by power boats, shoreline
       erosion, and lake turbidity which decreases fishery performance.
    7. GATHERING OF FIREWOOD PROHIBITED- This reduces destruction of flora
       (plants) and insures that there is a proper environment for all
       types of flora and fauna (animals).
    8. QUIET HOURS 10 PM - 8 AM.

   Please leave your County Parks as you would like to find them. Thank
   you and enjoy!
