   We shipped (9/1998) a 4.5 MHz, 1 MW RF Oscillator system to HBT-EP, to
   be used for Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating experiments. It has been
   tested at LANL and Columbia into a dummy load, but as of 5/99, it has
   not yet been installed on the tokamak The main oscillator was obtained
   from Columbia (originated at Wisconsin), and completely rebuilt at
   LANL. Charging and matching systems were added.

   Up until 1998, Los Alamos and Columbia had a collaboration to actively
   control MHD instabilities in the tokamak. These instabilities would
   otherwise limit the plasma performance, or even cause a loss of plasma
   confinement (disruption). Our approach is to use currents driven in
   external helical windings to stabilize particular modes in the plasma.
   The Columbia University HBT-EP tokamak is a small research tokamak
   which has a number of innovative features, including a movable
   conducting wall, shown in the Schematic. The distance from the plasma
   to the passive stabilizer is a factor in the growth rates of the
   instabilities.

   The growth rates of MHD modes will be studied at different distances to
   the passive stabilizer (wall), in conjunction with active stabilization
   techniques. As part of the collaboration, LANL supplied two 20
   MegaWatt,  power amplifiers, to provide the muscle to drive coil
   currents of up to 600 Amperes at 20kHz, to resonantly suppress the m=2,
   n=1 instability. One of the two modules (each with two channels), is
   shown below. A technician provides the scale. Each unit has six ML8618
   water-cooled power triode tubes. The first unit was shipped to New York
   in March 1995. Frequency chirping (increasing in time) has demonstrated
   the ability to spin up the MHD activity in the plasma.
