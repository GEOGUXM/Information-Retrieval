     Need Help Using Our Site?

   The easiest way to stay oriented in our site is to understand how the
   navigation bar works. This bar is on the left side of all pages in our
   site...including this one!

   It's where you'll find quick access to two of the most useful links in
   our site - the Site Map link and the link to our Home Page.

   The Site Map page breaks our entire site into an easy to follow visual
   directory...give it a try! Of course, the Home Page link will always
   return you directly to our home page.

   The links to the major sections of our site are also found in the
   navigation bar. You can go directly to the section you're interested in
   by choosing one of these links.

   Once in a major section, such as About the Authority, you will have an
   index of links right below the page title. These links are directly
   related to the major section you are currently browsing. (see below)

   Remember, you can always jump directly to major sections by using the
   navigation bar.

   We hope you find your stay with us both informative and enjoyable!
