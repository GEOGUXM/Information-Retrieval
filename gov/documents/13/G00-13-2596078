About the Bypass Budget

     What is NCI's Bypass Budget?

     It is the National Cancer Institute's annual strategic plan and
     budget document.
     * Each year, as mandated by the National Cancer Act of 1971 (P.L.
       92-218), the National Cancer Institute prepares this plan and
       budget proposal for supporting the cancer research workforce with
       the technologies and resources it needs, building on research
       successes, and ensuring that research discoveries are applied to
       improve human health.
     * The full title of the print version is The Nation's Investment in
       Cancer Research: A Plan and Budget Proposal.
     * The online version is called The Nation's Investment in Cancer
       Research: Plans and Priorities for Cancer Research.
     * The proposal is called the "Bypass Budget" because it is provided
       directly to the President of the United States in the fall of each
       year for use in formulating the budget request to Congress,
       "bypassing" ordinary budget channels at the National Institutes of
       Health and the Department of Health and Human Services.

     What information does it contain?

     It contains nearly one hundred pages of information about the
     National Cancer Institute:
     * Its vision for cancer research
     * Its goals and progress in specific priority areas
     * The plans and funding requirements for a specific fiscal year

     Recent online versions also serve as portals to numerous additional
     sources of information related to the content of the Bypass.

     Who should read it?

     In addition to the President and Congress, the document is intended
     for use by:
     * NCI staff
     * The cancer research community
     * Professional organizations
     * Advisory groups
     * Cancer information, education, and advocacy organizations
     * Public and private policymakers whose decisions affect cancer
       research and care in America

     It is our hope that this document will inform and inspire all who
     read it to join the fight against cancer.
