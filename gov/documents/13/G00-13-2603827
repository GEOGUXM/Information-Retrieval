   NOTE: For those users who prefer to or are used to download CDF files
   directly from the CDF FTP site, please note that the CDF files in the
   pub/cdf directory on nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov have been transferred to the

                          The Common Data Format (CDF)

   The National Space Science Data Center's (NSSDC) Common Data Format
   (CDF) is a self-describing data abstraction for the storage and
   manipulation of multidimensional data in a discipline-independent
   fashion. When one first hears the term "Common Data Format" one
   intuitively thinks of data formats in the traditional (i.e.
   messy/convoluted storage of data on disk or tape) sense of the word.
   Although CDF has its own internal self describing format, it consists
   of more than just a data format. CDF is a scientific data management
   package (known as the "CDF Library") which allows programmers and
   application developers to manage and manipulate scalar, vector, and
   multi-dimensional data arrays. The irony of the term "FORMAT" is that
   the actual data format which CDF utilizes is completely transparent to
   the user and accessible through a consistent set of interface (known as
   the "CDF Interface") routines. Therefore, programmers are not burdened
   with performing low level I/O's to physically format and unformat the
   data file. This is all done for them. The development of CDF arose out
   of the recognition by the NSSDC for a class of data models that is
   matched to the structure of scientific data and the applications (i.e.
   statistical and numerical methods, visualization, and management) they
   serve.

Java and Perl APIs Now Available with CDF 2.7

   The NSSDC's Common Data Format (CDF) Office has completed the
   development of the CDF Java Application Program Interfaces (APIs), and
   the APIs are available to the general public, in addition to the
   current C and Fortran APIs, as part of the CDF 2.7 package. The advent
   of the CDF Java APIs significantly benefits the CDF user community
   since a CDF application can now be written in platform-independent Java
   language and can run on any of the Java-supported platforms (Java is
   supported virtually on all platforms today) without any modifications
   (but make sure that platform is supported by the core CDF library).
   This encourages sharing of scientific data analysis code among
   scientists and promotes science. The document for Java-CDF APIs is
   available on-line.

   Java versions of the CDF tools (e.g. SkeletonCDF, SkeletonTable,
   CDFConvert, etc.) are also available as part of CDF 2.7. CDF 2.7 is
   backward compatible with the previous CDF releases, and it includes a
   more robust CDF library and some features that weren't available in CDF
   2.6.x such as ability to copy a variable with or without data. Click
   here for a more detailed CDF 2.7 features.

   In addition to Java APIs, the CDF Perl APIs are now available as an
   optional package.

   NOTE: The CDF Java APIs and tools are not available for the MS-DOS (not
   Windows 3.1/95/98/2000/NT) operating system. The APIs and tools are not
   fully tested for the OpenVMS operating sytem, and they'll be made
   available at the place where the new CDF 2.7 library is located once
   fully tested. The improved CDF 2.7 library for OpenVMS is available
   now.

CDF Embraces XML New

   The CDF office realizes that scientific progress is often impeded by
   the lack of, or excessive multiplicity of, available standards for data
   formats and structures and/or data format translators. In a bid to
   facilitate and promote data sharing with other data formats, the CDF
   office has recently decided to adopt Extensible Markup Language (XML)
   as the basis for establishing interoperability with other scientific
   data formats. XML is a language defined by the World Wide Web
   Consortium (W3C), and it is an emerging technology for describing
   digital information. XML is a method for putting structured data in a
   text file, and it is gaining support from a wide spectrum of users
   including academia, various government organizations, various technical
   committees, and commercial software companies such as Sun Microsystems
   and Microsoft.

   The CDF office has developed an XML-based markup language called CDF
   Markup Language (CDFML) to describe CDF data and metadata. The CDFML
   employs some of the basic building blocks/objects defined in eXtensible
   Data Format (XDF), a XML-based scientific data format, within CDF tags
   to describe CDF data and metadata. The use of these XDF objects allowed
   the CDF office to capitalize on the existing infrastructure code
   already developed by the Astronomical Data Center (ADC). To date,
   software has been developed and tested to convert CDF data and metadata
   stored in CDFML into XDF. The CDF office plans to develop software to
   export the contents a CDF file into the CDFML format and vice versa in
   the near future.

CDF Evolution Plans

   The CDF Office has set as a long-term goal to work with NSSDC's
   NASA/Science Office of Standards and Technology (NOST) in facilitating
   a process for reviewing community requirements for science data formats
   and associated software and to work with such format groups as HDF,
   netCDF, and FITS to establish interoperability across, and mutually
   complementary evolution paths for, these and related formats. The CDF
   office is participating in the Formats Evolution Process Committee
   (FEPC), chaired by NOST, representing CDF.
