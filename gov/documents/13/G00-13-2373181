   NOAA Central Library

WINDandSEA: The Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences Internet Locator

   This locator was built in response to the many reference questions that
   are posed to the library and is meant to make Internet searching more
   efficient for the NOAA community, the academic community, other
   government agencies concerned with oceanic and atmospheric issues, and
   the general public. Presently WINDandSEA has over 1,000 selected links
   to science and policy sites organized by topic and alphabetically
   within topic. All of these sites have been reviewed and annotated by a
   technical information specialist of the NOAA Central Library staff. If
   you have any comments regarding this site or wish to suggest additional
   sites or topics, please send e-mail to: reference@nodc.noaa.gov
     __________________________________________________________________

     Wetlands "We are part of the earth and it is part of us.  All things
   are connected.
   We did not weave the web.  We are merely strands in it.
   Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves."
   Chief Seattle
