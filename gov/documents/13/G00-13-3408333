               Welcome to the site of a new national library.

       The National Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology
   Education Digital Library (NSDL) is now under construction with funding
     from the National Science Foundation. The NSDL will offer, via the
   Internet, high-quality materials for science, mathematics, engineering
   and technology education. Its initial release is scheduled for the fall
    of 2002. The NSDL is likely to be the largest and most heterogeneous
                         digital library yet built.
   The accessibility of its collections and range of services will enable
   the NSDL to enhance education in all scientific disciplines across the
     nation. In the words of NSF program staff, the NSDL "will strongly
      affect education at all levels, including preK-12, undergraduate,
   graduate, and life-long learning, by providing anytime, anywhere access
   to a rich array of authoritative and reliable interactive materials and
                           learning environments."
