   [elbow.gif]   What is GATHER?

   GATHER, Geographic Analysis Tool for Health and Environmental Research,
   is an online spatial data access system that provides members of the
   public health community and general public access to spatial data that
   is pertinent to the analysis and exploration of public health issues.
   GATHER is powered by a GIS datawarehouse hosted by ATSDR/CDC and is
   enhanced with features that are of key value to members of the public
   health community. Not simply a "map my house" tool, GATHER is uniquely
   focused on the challenges that are encountered by public health
   professionals as they investigate public health concerns or simply
   gather information about a health issue.
