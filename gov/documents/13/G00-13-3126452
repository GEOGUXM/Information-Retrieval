      How we handle the information we gather when you visit our web site

      We collect and store only the following information about you:  The
      name of the domain from which you access the Internet (i.e., erols.com,
      if you are connecting from an Erols account, or harvard.edu if you are
      connecting from Harvard University's domain); the date and time you
      access our site; the item you requested from the server; and the
      Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our
      site. If your browser accepts cookies we may use a cookie to determine
      if you are a repeat or new visitor, or to understand how many different
      visitors come to our sites. When we examine this data, it is always
      presented in an aggregate form. Except as outlined in the Security
      section at the bottom of this document, we do not track or look at
      individuals' usage behavior.

      For more information on cookies, and how they are used in GSA.gov,
      please refer to our Cookies Page.

      If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail:

      When you send us personally-identifying information, (e.g., in an
      electronic mail message containing a question or comment), or by
      filling out a form that E-mails us this information, we use this
      information to respond to your request. We may also forward your E-mail
      to other Government employees, who are better able to answer your
      questions.

      We want to make it clear that we will not obtain personally-identifying
      information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to
      provide such information to us. Except for authorized law enforcement
      investigations, or as otherwise required by law, we do not share any
      information we receive with any outside parties.

      Links to other sites:

      The documents posted on this Website may contain hypertext links or
      pointers to information created and maintained by other public and
      private organizations. These links and pointers are provided for
      visitors' convenience. GSA does not control or guarantee the accuracy,
      timeliness, or completeness of any linked information from non-GSA
      sites.

      The inclusion of links or pointers to Web sites is not intended to
      assign importance to those sites or the information contained therein,
      nor is it intended to endorse or recommend any views expressed, or
      products or services offered on these sites.

      Personalization:

      Some GSA sites allow you to personalize them, either by selecting sets
      of content to place on a web page or by clicking on an icon indicating
      a desire for a certain kind of content. In some cases, you are asked to
      "register" in order to get this personalized content. If you provide
      personally-identifying information when registering for personalized
      content, that information is only used to deliver the content to you.
      The information is never shared with any third party.

      Security:

      For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
      available to all users, GSA webservers employ industry-standard methods
      to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload
      or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts
      to upload information or change information on GSA servers are strictly
      prohibited and may be punishable by law, including the Computer Fraud
      and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure
      Protection Act.

      In the specific context of this security monitoring, there is no
      expectation of privacy. However, only in the case of actual law
      enforcement investigations, will we attempt to identify individual
      users or their usage habits.
