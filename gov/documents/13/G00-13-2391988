   The information below is specific to cancer control and population
   sciences research at the National Cancer Institute:
   Overview of NCI's Cancer Control and Population Sciences Research Grant
   Portfolio

   In Fiscal Year (FY) 2000, the Division of Cancer Control and Population
   Sciences (DCCPS) funded 693 research grants, totaling $297.5 million.
   Table 1/Chart 1 shows the distribution of the research grant portfolio
   by scientific program: epidemiology and genetics research, behavioral
   research, applied research, surveillance research and survivorship
   research. It also identifies the number of intervention research grants
   and funding levels for each of the program areas.
   Table 2/Chart 2 shows the distribution of behavioral research grants by
   scientific focus: applied cancer screening research, basic
   biobehavioral research, health communication and informatics research,
   health promotion research, and tobacco control research.
   Table 3 shows the distribution of FY 2000 cancer control and population
   sciences grants by funding mechanism. Approximately 59 percent of the
   division's grant portfolio is funded through the RO1 research project
   grant mechanism.
