                               WELCOME TO THE

                SOUTH EAST REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE ACCESS TEAM

                                  HOME PAGE


   The South East Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) was
   organized in 1997 to establish a crystallography facility at the
   Advanced Photon Source , a high brilliance 3^rd generation synchrotron
   light source located at Argonne National Laboratory in Argonne,
   Illinois. The SER-CAT program currently consists of 20 member
   institutions across 10 states and the National Institutes of Health
   Intramural Program. SER-CAT is administrated through the Department of
   Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Georgia.

   Beginning in June 2002, SER-CAT plans on providing its members with
   reliable, rapid and timely access to a fully automated X-ray beamline.
   Members will be provided with a comprehensive research facility,
   including a full complement of instrumentation, software, and support
   staff for high throughput data collection and processing. In addition,
   we hope to provide the capability of direct remote access via an
   Internet II point of presence from a researcher's home institution. The
   principal focus of the SER-CAT research is macromolecular
   crystallography.
