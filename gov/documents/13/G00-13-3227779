                - Latest NASA Ames Acquisition Forecast
                The forecast consolidates anticipated procurements at each
                of NASA's centers into an agencywide report, with the aim
                of increasing industries' advance knowledge of NASA
                requirements.

        MidRange Procurement Program
                The MidRange Procurement Program is a new development to
                streamline the acquisition process for "middle range"
                procurements - those greater than the simplified
                acquisition threshold and not more than $2,000,000 in
                basic value (not more than $10,000,000 with options) and
                for "commercial items" (FAR Part 12) not more than
                $25,000,000 including options.
