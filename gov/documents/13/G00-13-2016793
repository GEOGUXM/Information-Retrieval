                                                                   lobster

   The goal of the National Strategy is to restore function to one million
   acres of estuarine habitat by the year 2010. The National Strategy
   establishes seven objectives to achieve this goal. They are:
    1. Create and maintain effective restoration partnerships.
    2. Encourage priority setting and restoration planning in the coastal
       United States.
    3. Implement restoration projects to provide healthy ecosystems that
       support wildlife, fish/shellfish, improve surface water and
       groundwater quality, enhance flood control, and increase
       opportunities for outdoor recreation.
    4. Apply the best appropriate restoration science and technology in
       project design and implementation.
    5. Evaluate effectiveness of estuarine habitat restoration efforts.
    6. Increase government, corporate and individual awareness of and
       support for estuary restoration and protection.
    7. Obtain sufficient funding, both public and private, to implement
       restoration planning activities, monitoring at estuary and project
       scales, outreach measures, and on-the-ground projects to restore
       one million acres of estuarine habitat by 2010.
