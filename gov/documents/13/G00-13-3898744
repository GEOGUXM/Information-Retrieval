   What's New

      Final Vegetation Management Plan Now Available


   Print copies of the final Vegetation Management Plan (VMP) and
   Environmental Assessment are now available for review in the Presidio
   Trust Library (34 Graham Street on the Main Post). Adopted by the
   National Park Service and Presidio Trust board in 2001, the VMP is a
   strategy for ensuring that the Presidio's precious native habitats,
   beautiful views, stately historic forest and orderly military-era
   gardens are preserved and enhanced for decades to come. A limited
   number of copies are also available upon request. If you would like to
   receive a print copy of the document, please call (415) 561-5414 or
   email planning@presidiotrust.gov. An electronic version of the VMP and
   the Environmental Assessment will be posted to this website shortly.
