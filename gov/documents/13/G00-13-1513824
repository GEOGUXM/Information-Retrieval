                     Synchrotron Takes Aim at Live Cells

                               By Paul Preuss

   A bright, tightly focused beam of infrared light from the ALS's
   beamline 1.4.3 allows researchers to follow subtle chemical and
   molecular changes in individual human cells, without killing the cells
   or using intrusive probes.

   Traditional methods of biomedical research require killing cells
   (fixing them), averaging results from many cells, or introducing dyes,
   tagged proteins, or other agents that can affect cell
   chemistry--methods that involve tedious preparation and long delays
   between experiment and result.

   "Now we can study individual cells in real time without introducing
   extraneous factors," says Hoi-Ying Holman of the Earth Sciences
   Division, the principal investigator in developing the new technique.

   Holman and her colleague Michael Martin of the ALS described the
   technique, known as Synchrotron Radiation-Based Fourier Transform
   Infrared spectromicroscopy, at recent meetings of the American Chemical
   Society and the American Physical Society.

   Despite the jawbreaking name, the principle of SR-FTIR
   spectromicroscopy is straightforward. Different molecular and physical
   states of a cell absorb different wavelengths of infrared light,
   yielding unique spectra that can distinguish different cell types,
   different phases in the cell cycle, and different chemical reactions
   and physical changes inside the cell.

   Light from the infrared beamline is hundreds of times as intense as
   conventional infrared sources and can be focused to a spot less than 10
   micrometers in diameter, smaller than the dimensions of a typical
   mammalian cell.

   "We can position the spot on a sample within one micrometer," says
   Wayne McKinney, who developed the beam line with Martin. He adds that
   "because the synchrotron light comes in pulses two nanoseconds apart,
   we can record very fast changes in cells." Although this capacity has
   not been applied to work done so far, it promises to open new insights
   into cellular processes.

   So far, Holman and her collaborators have concentrated on the response
   of cultured human cells to low doses of environmental agents. In lung
   cells, they have shown that different oxidizers and x-rays produce
   different kinds of damage marked by distinct spectral changes. In liver
   cells, their work indicates that dioxin's influence is related to its
   interaction with a specific binding site.

   They have also recorded distinctive spectra from lung cells going
   through different stages of the cell cycle. With other researchers,
   they plan to study radiation and drug therapies for brain tumors and
   oxidative stress in such diseases as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and
   rheumatoid arthritis.

   SR-FTIR spectromicroscopy allows studies of live cells impossible or
   impractical by any other method, enabling basic studies of the life,
   death, damage, and self-repair of tissues and cells at the subcellular
   level.
