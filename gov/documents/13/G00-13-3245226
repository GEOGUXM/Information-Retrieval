                      Victim-Witness Assistance Program
     __________________________________________________________________

   The FBI's Victim-Witness Assistance Program (VWAP) was established to
   help assist those who have suffered, or been threatened with, direct
   physical, emotional, and/or other kinds of harm as a result of a
   commission of a federal crime investigated by the FBI. The Bureau
   provides victims and witnesses with their first, and sometimes only,
   contact with the federal criminal justice system.

   As federal law enforcement professionals, the employees of the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation are concerned about the problems victims and
   witnesses often experience. As victims and witnesses, you may
   experience anger, confusion, frustration, fear, or other reactions as a
   result of a crime.

   The Victim-Witness Assistance Program is available to inform you of
   your rights. As a federal crime victim you are entitled to:

     * the right to be treated with fairness and with respect for your
     dignity and privacy;

     * the right to be reasonably protected from the accused offender;

     * the right to be notified of court proceedings;

     * the right to be present at all public court proceedings related to
     the offense, unless the court determines that your testimony would
     be materially affected if you heard other testimony at trial;

     * the right to confer with the attorney for the government in the
     case;

     * the right to restitution; and

     * the right to information about the conviction, sentencing,
     imprisonment, and release of the offender.


   If you are a victim or witness to a federal crime that the Richmond FBI
   Office is investigating, please contact the Victim-Witness Coordinator
   for more information. The FBI is here to serve you.

   Victim-Witness Coordinator, Richmond FBI, Dennette W. Stacy (804)
