                        GTE Instrument Development: CITE Expeditions

      Our understanding of tropospheric chemistry is limited primarily by our
      ability to accurately measure the minute quantities of key tropospheric
      species. An initial, and continuing, focus of the GTE has been the
      development, testing, and evaluation of techniques capable of airborne
      measurements of trace species. A series of rigorous airborne
      intercomparisons, called the Chemical Instrumentation Test and
      Evaluation (CITE) experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
      performance of promising instrumentation. These intercomparisons were
      conducted blind and under conditions which expose the instruments to a
      wide range of conditions in both polluted and clean -air settings. The
      advanced instruments validated by CITE have been used to carry out GTE
      field measurements in regions of critical importance to global
      tropospheric chemistry.

      Three CITE mission have been conducted as part of GTE. The
      CITE-1mission, consisting of a ground- based intercomparison (1983),
      and two separate airborne campaigns (1983 and 1984), evaluated
      instrumentation for measuring carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO),
      and the hydroxyl radical (OH). The CITE- 2 mission focused on
      intercomparison of techniques for measuring nitrogen dioxide (NO[2]),
      nitric acid (HNO[3]) and peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN), as well as a
      re-evaluation of NO techniques. The CITE-3 mission focused on
      intercomparison of techniques to measure key sulfate species sulfur
      dioxide (SO[2]), dimethylsulfide (DMS), hydrogen sulfide (H[2]S),
      carbonyl sulfide (COS), and carbon disulfide (CS[2]).
