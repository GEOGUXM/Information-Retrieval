                         International Women's Day -
            Women Inspiring Women: Celebrating New Opportunities
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Jan. 25, 2002

     Lisa Ling, co-host of ABC's Daytime's The View and a seasoned
     reporter, will be the keynote speaker at the city of Phoenix's 11th
     annual International Women's Day luncheon, noon to 1:30 p.m.
     Tuesday, March 5, at the Phoenix Civic Plaza Ballroom, Third and
     Jefferson streets. Doors open at 11:30 a.m.

     "Women Inspiring Women: Celebrating New Opportunities" is the theme
     of the luncheon hosted by the city of Phoenix, the Phoenix Women's
     Commission and the International Women's Day Steering Committee. The
     honorary chair of the event is Bettye Jackson, president and CEO of
     Jackson Airport Enterprises Inc.

     Ling has reported from more than two dozen countries including
     Afghanistan, India, Cambodia, China, Colombia, Iraq and Vietnam. She
     has gone to the front lines of civil war where she interviewed
     members of the Taliban and served as a freelance correspondent for
     the weekend edition of ABC News.

     At 16-years-old, Ling was selected to be one of four hosts on
     Scratch, a nationally syndicated teen magazine show, and by 18, she
     became one of the youngest reporters for Channel One News, a network
     seen in middle and high schools throughout the country. In February
     2001, she hosted the television special Teen People's 20 Teens Who
     Will Change The World. Ling's incredible footage from Afghanistan
     helped provide insight for The Day It All Changed, a forum for teens
     that she hosted in September 2001 for the WB Network.

     International Women's Day is celebrated worldwide to commemorate the
     struggle of women to improve their lives. The luncheon proceeds
     benefit the International Women's Day Scholarship fund, which
     provides educational scholarships to re-entry women interested in
     furthering their education.

     In the past seven years, more than $280,000 has been raised for
     scholarships that were awarded to nine local colleges benefiting
     approximately 300 women.

     Platinum sponsors of the event include KTVK 3TV/Mas Arizona,
     ARAMARK, Arizona Public Service, city of Phoenix, Philips
     Semiconductor, Today's Arizona Woman and Wells Fargo.

     Tickets, $45 for general admission and $30 for students and senior
     citizens, are available at the Phoenix Civic Plaza box office
     beginning Feb. 8.
