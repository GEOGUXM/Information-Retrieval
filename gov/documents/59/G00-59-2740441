     * Beginning October 1997, the EOS/HPC/IDS project has been replaced
       by an EOS/IDS investigation on Regional Land-Atmosphere Climate
       Simulation System (RELACS). Relevant files will be transferred to
       the new RELACS site, where latest information on this EOS/IDS will
       be posted. This site will be kept until the transfer is complete.

   "HPC" stands for "Hydrological Processes and Climate", which is an
   Earth Observing System (EOS)/ Interdisciplinary Science Team (IDS)
   project. This WWW server is provided for scientific community
   interested in the current status and progress of HPC project.
