   Live collisions from CDF and D0

   The event displays in the pop-up window show you real particle
   collisions LIVE as they happen at Fermilab's CDF and D0 detectors. You
   may click the images for a larger view. Images refresh every 15
   seconds. (When you revisit this page, you'll get new images after 15
   seconds.) If you find an interesting event, please do not claim the
   Nobel Prize before we do. Thanks!

   collisions from D0
   Note: When no collisions are occurring, CDF and D0 will show events
   from their "Greatest Hits" collection.
