                      Discovery of Elements 118 and 116

   In a paper submitted to Phys Rev Letters in late May, scientists from
   the Berkeley Lab and Oregon State University report the observation of
   superheavy elements in the reaction ^86Kr + ^208Pb performed at LBNL's
   88-Inch Cyclotron.  The group, using the newly constructed Berkeley
   Gas-Filled Separator, observed three events consisting of a chain of
   six alpha particles (^4He nuclei) emitted sequentially following the
   reaction, an unambiguous signal of the production and subsequent decay
   of Element 118.

   The Science

   I.    New Elements

        The reaction of 449 MeV ^86Kr + ^208Pb occurs at an energy just
   enough above the Coulomb barrier (the energy required to make the Kr
   and Pb fuse together) so that one neutron is evaporated to make
   ^293118. (Figure 1) [HI-RES JPEG (137 kB)] This is a relatively cold
   reaction, referring to the temperature, or energy of the fused nuclei.
   Before this experiment scientists thought that these cold reactions
   could not be used to make elements heavier than Element 112, because
   the production rates are too low.  However, recent calculations by
   Robert Smolanczuk, from the Soltan Institute for Nuclear Studies in
   Poland and a visiting Fulbright Scholar at LBNL, indicated that
   increased production rates with the ^86Kr + ^208Pb reaction were
   possible, prompting the experimental search at the Berkeley Lab.
       The chain of alpha particles measured in this reaction (Figure 2)
   lead through a series of elements or isotopes that have never been
   observed before (Elements 118 and 116 are totally new, Element 114 has
   possibly been observed in a recent "hot fusion reaction" experiment in
   Dubna, Russia but is not yet confirmed, and Elements 112, 110, 108 and
   106 are known, but the isotopes observed in the present experiment have
   never before been seen.)  (Figure 3) Because of this, it is not
   possible to directly confirm that the ^293118 is the parent of this
   decay chain. However, other possibilities are not energetically
   feasible, and the energies and lifetimes of the measured alpha
   particles agree with theoretical predictions.


   II.    A New Region of Stability

       The sequence of decay events measured in this experiment is
   consistent with theories that have long predicted an "island of
   stability" for elements of approximately 114 protons and 184 neutrons.
   This experiment appears to have reached the edge of this island because
   the production rates for Element 118 - approximately one in every 10^12
   interactions produced an atom of Element 118 - is larger than that
   measured in unsuccessful searches for Element 113. It is possible that
   with present accelerator technologies, it will not be possible to
   directly make the elements in the "sea of instability" leading up to
   this island.
        The significance of this work goes beyond the discovery of two new
   superheavy elements.  It is now clear that studies of superheavy
   elements are possible:  the island of stability can be reached.
   Additionally, similar reactions can be used to produce other elements
   and isotopes, providing a rich new region for the study of nuclear and
   even chemical properties.

   The Instrumentation

       The discovery of Elements 118 and 116 were made possible by the
   unique combination of the 88-Inch Cyclotron, with its state-of-the-art
   ion sources, and the Berkeley Gas-Filled Separator (BGS).

   I.    The 88-Inch Cyclotron

        The E.O. Lawrence Berkeley National Lab has its origin in the
   invention of the cyclotron by E.O. Lawrence in 1929.  The 88-Inch is a
   third generation cyclotron of Lawrence's design, in operation since
   1961. The 88-Inch is a national user facility operated by Berkeley Lab
   for the Department of Energy serving researchers from around the world
   for basic and applied research. (Figure 4) [Download Hi-Res Tiff (9
   MB)]
       Numerous upgrades have kept the 88-Inch competitive with newer
   accelerators. The most significant upgrades were the addition of two
   high-performance electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion sources for the
   production of high charge-state ions, which increases the maximum
   output energy and intensity of the Cyclotron for higher mass elements.
   (Photo 1), [Download Hi-Res Tiff (8.5 MB)] With these additions, the
   88-Inch can now accelerate beams of ions as light as hydrogen and as
   heavy as uranium. The ECR ions sources also allow the efficient use of
   rare isotopes of stable elements, either from natural or enriched
   sources. For the present experiment ^86Kr, the most neutron-rich stable
   isotope of Kr, was run using enriched material. The  ^86Kr beam was
   delivered to the experiment at an average of approximately 2 trillion
   ions per second, crucial to the success of the experiment. At present
   time, the 88-Inch is the only accelerator in the United States which
   can deliver Kr beams at the intensities that the experiment demanded.


   II.    The Berkeley Gas-Filled Separator (BGS)

   The newly constructed BGS was the key to the success of this
   experiment. (Photo 2, Photo 3) [Download Hi-Res TIFF (9.2MB): Photo2Hi,
   Photo3Hi) Its innovative design has resulted in a separator with
   unsurpassed efficiency and background suppression. For these
   experiments, the strong magnetic fields in the BGS focused the Element
   118 atoms and separated them from the beam and all the interfering
   reaction products. (Figure 5) [Download HI_RES JPEG (150kB)] Since
   Element 118 is only made once in every 10^12, or million-million,
   interactions between beam and target, it is very important to i)
   capture as many of the Element 118 atoms created as possible, and ii)
   not have other products hitting the detector which would create
   background counts.  The new BGS detector is estimated to have an
   efficiency of approximately 75% for Element 118, which is as high as
   any existing separators of this kind.  The separated Element 118 atoms
   were implanted directly into a solid state silicon strip detector.
   Then the electronics looked for alpha particles decaying in the silicon
   detector, recording the position and energy of each decay.  In order to
   suppress the background from beam and other products, a thin gas
   parallel plate avalanche counter (PPAC) was placed in front of the
   silicon strip detector. This detector was used to distinguish with 99%
   efficiency between particles that were beam-related and events due to
   the decay of implanted atoms.
