                NWS Radiosonde (Weather Balloon) Observations
     __________________________________________________________________

   balloon before launch Radiosondes are instruments used by weather
   agencies around the world to collect weather information. These
   instruments are carried aloft by balloons to measure and simultaneously
   transmit recorded data which include pressure, temperatures and
   humidity. Winds are determined by using an instrument that tracks the
   radio signal transmitted from the radiosonde.
   Data from the radiosonde is interpreted at the launching station and
   entered into a worldwide communications network. In this manner,
   information is relayed to various forecast centers around the globe.
   Radiosonde observations are taken twice daily at 0000 hours and 1200
   hours Universal Coordinated Time (UTC, formerly "GMT"). All worldwide
   agencies launch their radiosondes at approximately the same time, and
   over 1500 such observations are taken daily.
   In the United States, data is collected at the National Center for
   Environmental Prediction (NCEP) in Washington, D.C. The radiosonde data
   is processed together with over 25,000 surface observations, hundreds
   of aircraft reports and a wealth of satellite data. Location, movement,
   as well as strength of the weather systems that circle the earth are
   analyzed from this data. Through mathematical equations, large
   supercomputers at NCEP then project weather patterns anywhere from
   three to seven days into the future. The NCEP computers produce a wide
   assortment of maps and numerical forecast data, and these are then
   relayed to field forecast offices where local and regional weather
   forecasts are prepared.
   balloon launch In the greater Washington, D.C. area, NWS offices are
   located at Dulles airport, at the NASA GSFC Wallops Flight Facility,
   and in Aberdeen, Maryland. These stations are part of the worldwide
   network that launch radiosondes twice daily. Although not identical,
   the balloon and instrument package released by these offices are
   similar to those used by other nations, including Mexico and Canada.
   Balloons generally reach altitudes as high as 100,000 feet prior to
   bursting about 90 minutes after launch. Distances traveled by the
   balloon may vary significantly due to the nature of winds in the upper
   atmosphere. The atmosphere that encircles the earth flows as vast
   rivers, and winds often show tremendous variations in direction and
   speed as a balloon rises. During a balloon ascent, winds may completely
   reverse direction or range from calm at the surface to over 200 mph in
   high level jet streams.
   Data on winds, temperatures and humidity help forecasters predict
   clouds, rain and the paths of major storms. The information is also
   critical to the prediction of a variety of severe weather events which
   includes defining the threat of tornadoes, damaging thunderstorms or
   high winds.
   radiosonde/sensor package Radiosonde balloons are inflated with either
   helium or hydrogen gases and are usually launched in an open field,
   generally at an airport where obstructions are at a minimum. When
   completely inflated, the balloon reaches about eight to ten feet in
   height.
   Information relating to the data and location of launch are stamped on
   the package prior to release. A manufacturers number is also carried on
   the package. A parachute is attached to the radiosonde just prior to
   launch. This prevents destruction of the instrument so that it can be
   reused.
   The radiosonde data transmitted back to the launching station can be
   represented graphically, showing wind speed, direction and temperature
   at altitude.
   As you might imagine, the radiosonde weather balloon plays a
   significant part in the observation, analysis and prediction of the
   world's weather. In spite of the advances in satellite and computer
   technology, the weather balloon remains a very significant and integral
   part of the worlds weather observation network.
