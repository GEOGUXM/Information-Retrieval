                                Introduction

   As part of the Black Hills Hydrology Study, precipitation data were
   summarized for the Black Hills area in South Dakota for water years
   1931-98 in a recently published U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report
   (OFR 00-329).  Precipitation data are available for numerous gaging
   locations; however, few gages have continuous, long-term records, and
   periods of missing record are common.  Thus, a geographic information
   system (GIS) utilizing an inverse-distance weighting method was
   developed to generate spatial precipitation distributions from point
   precipitation data for the Black Hills area, based on available monthly
   records.  The spatial distributions were used to estimate periods of
   missing record for selected gaging locations.  The resulting monthly
   records of measured and estimated precipitation were tabulated for
   water years 1931-98 for 94 gaging locations.  Average values for water
   years 1961-90, which is the period used for calculation of climatic
   normals, also were included with the tabulated data.  The 94 gaging
   locations include both National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA) gages and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gages.  Selected site
   information for the gages is presented in table 1, which provides links
   to download the monthly precipitation data.
