                         NCI-Frederick / Ft. Detrick
                     Take Your Child to Work Day (TYCWD)
                             General Information
     __________________________________________________________________

Date:

     * Wednesday, Wednesday, July 25, 2001 - RAIN OR SHINE

Time:

     * 8:30 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.

Purpose:

   ·        Introduce children, ages 6 to 13, to the vital public services
   that their parents provide in the support of NCI-Frederick's/Ft.
   Detrick's mission and to encourage future careers in science.

Who?

   ·        Employees are welcome to bring their children, ages 6 to 13,
   to work if approved by the employee's supervisor and safety rules are
   followed.

   ·        The events of TYCWD are only for children, ages 6 through 13.
   They are not appropriate for younger children. Younger siblings are not
   permitted to attend the event due to limited space. TYCWD is planned as
   an annual event, so those too young to participate this year will have
   an opportunity to attend in coming years.

   ·        A parent (or a designated responsible adult) must be with
   his/her child at all times. Any unsupervised children will not be
   permitted to participate in any of the day's activities. In some cases,
   due to limited space, adults may be asked to wait just outside the
   activity room.

   ·        Children 16 or older may volunteer to work at the Hub area
   (Contact Elynor Sass at 301-846-5854)

What?

   ·        TYCWD will include activities, free of charge, geared toward
   children ages 6 to 13.

   ·        The days activities will include:

   Scheduled Programs (requiring pre-registration)

   Hub Activities (entertainment, lunch specials, raffle prize drawings)

   ·        Souvenir bags with assorted goodies

Registration:

   ·        Because spaces are limited for selected events, we recommend
   that you register early. Registration will begin on Monday, July 2 and
   end on July 13 (or when activity is filled).

   ·        Registration is limited to 4 activities per child. It is also
   highly recommended that you do not sign up for more than 2 activities
   in succession since you could be rushed, and it is tiring for the
   children. Try, if possible, to leave an open period between activities.

   ·        Please do not enroll a child who is not within the age range
   specified by the activity sponsor.

   ·        Please share web access with your colleagues who do not have
   easy access to a computer.

   ·        Computers in the Scientific Library (Building 549) also will
   be available for those who do not have web access. Please ask for
   assistance at the desk (or call Ana Ulrich at 301-846-1093).

   ·        If you experience difficulty using the registration form,
   contact Elynor Sass at 301-846-5854.

Logistics:

  Information Tent (Hub)

   ·        Located at the Building 426 parking lot (see map).

   ·        Open from 8:20 a.m. 4:00 p.m. on the day of the event.

   ·         Water coolers and limited first aid will be available.

  Assembly for Activities

   ·        All activities will begin and end near the Hub.

   ·        Bring a copy of your printed itinerary.

   ·        Numbered activity signs corresponding to the number for each
   activity will be posted in numerical order across the street from the
   Hub, in front of Building 560.

   ·        Participants should assemble by the number of the event that
   they will attend during that period. All periods begin at quarter of
   the hour.

   ·        Escorts will lead each group from the Hub area to the location
   of the event precisely on time. Therefore, it is imperative that you be
   prompt. Those who are not at the sign at the time of departure will not
   be able to participate. Transportation will be provided to those
   activities taking place off-post.

   ·        For those with special needs, arrangements can be made for
   transportation by contacting Emily Moler at 301-846-1106.

  Clothing

   ·        For safety reasons, please do not wear sandals or other
   open-toed shoes. Sneakers or athletic shoes are recommended.

   ·         Be mindful of the weather. Sun block as well as umbrellas and
   slickers in case of rain are recommended.
