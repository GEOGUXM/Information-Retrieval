   The Director's Discretionary Fund (DDF) is a special program intended
   to support the imaginative ideas of the people at our Center. This is
   one of NASA's most visionary programs; many clever inspirations that
   were started with this "seed money" have turned into fully developed
   research projects.

   See DDF Projects from:
   1996
