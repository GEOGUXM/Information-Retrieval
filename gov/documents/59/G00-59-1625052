   Transportation National Highway Traffic Children Safety Administration
   In 1999, there were more than 58 million children under 15 years old in
   the United States. This age group (0-14 years) made up 21 percent of
   the total U.S. resident population in 1999. Motor vehicle crashes are
   the leading cause of death for children of every age from 6 to 14 years
   old (based on 1997 figures, which are the latest mortality data
   currently available from the National Center for Health Statistics). In
   1999, there were a total of 41,611 traffic fatalities in the United
   States. The 0-14 age group accounted for 6 percent (2,474) of those
   traffic fatalities. In addition, children under 15 years old accounted
   for 5 percent (1,724) of all vehicle occupant fatalities, 10 percent
   (318,000) of all the people injured in motor vehicle crashes, and 9
   percent (272,000) of all the vehicle occupants injured in crashes. In
   the United States, an average of 7 children 0-14 years old were killed
   and 872 were injured every day in motor vehicle crashes during 1999. In
   the 0-14 year age group, males accounted for 58 percent of the
   fatalities and 50 percent of those injured in motor vehicle crashes
   during 1999. "Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of Figure 1.

   1999 - Children 2 Child Endangerment In 1999, 21 percent of the
   children under 15 years old who were killed in motor vehicle crashes
   were killed in alcohol-related crashes. Of the children 0-14 years old
   who were killed in alcohol-related crashes during 1999, almost half
   (250) were passengers in vehicles with drivers who had been drinking,
   with blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels of 0.01 gram per
   deciliter (g/dl) or higher. An additional 129 children were killed as
   passengers in vehicles with drivers who had not been drinking. Another
   83 children under 15 years old who were killed in traffic crashes in
   1999 were pedestrians or pedalcyclists who were struck by drinking
   drivers (BAC $0.01 g/dl). Pedestrians In 1989, there were 873
   pedestrian fatalities in the 0-14 year age group. From 1989 to 1999,
   the number of pedestrian fatalities in this age group "In 1999, 21
   percent decreased by 41 percent, with the 5-9 year age group showing
   the largest of the children under decrease. 15 years old killed in
   There were 4,906 pedestrian fatalities in 1999. The 0-14 age group
   crashes were killed accounted for 517 (11 percent) of those fatalities,
   and 62 percent of the in alcohol-related pedestrian fatalities in this
   age group were males. crashes." Figure 2. Total Pedestrian Fatalities

   Children 3 In addition to the pedestrians under 15 years old who died,
   25,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes. These young pedestrians
   accounted for 30 percent of the total pedestrians injured in motor
   vehicle crashes in 1999. More than one-fifth (21 percent) of the
   traffic fatalities in the 0-14 year age group were pedestrians. During
   1999, 46 percent of the young pedestrian fatalities occurred between
   the hours of 4 pm and 8 pm, and 84 percent occurred at non-intersection
   locations. Pedalcyclists A total of 750 pedalcyclists were killed in
   motor vehicle crashes in 1999. Children 0-14 years old accounted for
   193 (26 percent) of those fatalities. In 1999, 39 percent of the
   pedalcyclists injured in motor vehicle crashes were under 15 years old.
   The 193 pedalcyclist fatalities in 1999 for the 0-14 year age group
   represent a decrease of 45 percent from the 352 killed in 1989. "In

   20590 Traffic Safety Facts 1999 - Children 4 Restraints Research has
   shown that lap/shoulder safety belts, when used, reduce the risk of
   fatal injury to front seat occupants (age 5 years and older) of
   passenger cars by 45 percent and the risk of moderate-to-critical
   injury by 50 percent. For light truck occupants, safety belts reduce
   the risk of fatal injury by 60 percent and the risk of
   moderate-to-critical injury by 65 percent. During 1999, 8,258 passenger
   vehicle occupants under 15 years old were involved in fatal crashes.
   For those children, where restraint use was known, 39 percent were
   unrestrained; among those who were fatally injured, 61 percent were
   unrestrained. Table 1. Restraint Use by Passenger Vehicle Occupants

   passenger vehicle occupant fatalities among children under 5 years of
   age. Of those 550 fatalities, an estimated 291 (53 percent) were
   totally unrestrained. Table 2. Children Under 5 Years Old Fatally

   restraint use have been distributed proportionally across the known
   restraint use categories. From 1975 through 1999, an estimated 4,500
   lives were saved by the use of child restraints (child safety seats or
   adult belts). In 1999, an estimated 307 children under age 5 were saved
   as a result of child restraint use. If 100 percent of motor vehicle
   occupants under 5 years old were protected by child safety seats, an
   estimated 469 lives (that is, an additional 162) could have been saved
   in 1999. National Center for Statistics & Analysis u Research &

   Safety Facts 1999 - Children 5 In 1998, NHTSA conducted the National
   Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS). One of the studies in the
   survey was the Controlled Intersection Study, which provided more
   detailed information about child restraint use for children under 5
   years old. Table 3. Restraint Use by Children Under 5 Years Old
