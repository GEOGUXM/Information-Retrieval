   Project Background:

   The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission has been
   competitively selected by NASA for development under a new Office of
   Mission to Planet Earth program called Earth System Science Pathfinders
   (ESSP). The two satellites fly at an altitude of between 300 and 450
   kilometers (186 and 280 miles) in nearly the same orbital plane, that
   is, one "chasing" the other, with a separation of about 200 kilometers
   (125 miles). As the satellites fly over a feature on the Earth, such as
   an ice sheet or a mountain range, their separation changes because each
   satellite is affected differently by the gravitational attraction of
   the feature.

   The satellites use a microwave link to measure both the exact
   separation distance and its rate of change to an accuracy of better
   than 1 micrometer per second (1/25000 of an inch per second), allowing
   a precise "snapshot" of the gravity field to be measured about every
   two weeks. This precise accuracy allows scientists to use the GRACE
   mission to "weigh" various parts of the Earth system, learning about
   the distribution and changes in ocean mass, the growth or shrinking of
   the polar ice sheets, the amount of water in underground aquifers and
   other issues profoundly affecting climate change. The GRACE data are
   also an excellent complement to ocean height measurements provided by
   the radar altimeter on the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite.

   GRACE will provide a framework for studying the gravitational
   signatures of gigantic, continent-sized underground water reservoirs,
   or aquifers. It also will provide a never-before-available perspective
   on global ocean circulation and the time variability of Earth's overall
   external shape, or geoid. This fundamental data set could enable great
   improvements in existing ocean radar altimetry data sets, and
   retrospective improvements of seasonal to inter-annual climate change
   estimates.

   Through an innovative teaming arrangement, GRACE's German partner, GFZ,
   will provide mission operations and a Russian booster for a spring 2001
   launch, greatly reducing the direct total cost to NASA, which is $85.9
   million. In addition to JPL, other partners include Loral Space
   Systems, Palo Alto, CA, and Dornier of Germany to build the spacecraft.
