                              MILLION MOM MARCH

                                [mom514c.gif]

     I was proud to march with the Michigan Moms on Mothers' Day 2000 when
          they and hundreds of thousands of their supporters brought their
        commonsense message of responsible gun legislation to the Nation's
   Capital. To see pictures of the march, visit my Million Mom March photo
                                                                   album.

      In the wake of the Littleton tragedy in 1999, Americans began looking
      to their lawmakers to pass responsible legislation and put an end to
      the pattern of youth violence we have sadly seen far too much of in the
      last few years.

   After each horrific school shooting, each one of us asks how these
   tragedies could have occurred, and more importantly, how they could
   have been prevented? There are many causes of violent behavior by young
   people. Among them is the amount of violent material that children are
   subjected to daily on television, in movies, in video games and even
   the news. But the one crucial common denominator in all of these school
   shootings is the easy access to guns.

   As you no doubt know, there are no easy or simple solutions to the
   troubles which confront our youth today. I believe all of us owe it to
   our children to examine these issues carefully and identify further
   ways to reduce youth violence. I can assure that during my term in the
   Senate, I will continue to work on this very important issue.
