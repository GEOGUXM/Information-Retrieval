                  Transportation Indicators: December 2001

Introduction

   This report is intended to provide timely, easily accessible
   information for the transportation community. It was developed by the
   Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) of the U.S. Department of
   Transportation (DOT), and is updated each month on the BTS website.

   Each indicator is placed under a heading corresponding to one of the
   five strategic goals of DOT safety, mobility, economic growth,
   environment, and national security. Some indicators are related to more
   than one strategic goal.

   The indicators fall under two broad categories: those that provide
   context about the economy and society in which transportation
   functions, and those that convey information about an aspect of
   transportation. To the extent possible, these latter indicators are
   transportation-wide in scope; however, some apply to only part of the
   transportation system. Reference tables at the beginning of the
   document provide key statistics about U.S. social and economic
   characteristics, and about the extent of the transportation system.

   For indicators that are highly seasonal, the current value of that
   indicator is compared to the same time period in the previous year
   (e.g., April 2001 compared to April 2000). Otherwise, the tables show a
   comparison of the current value to a comparable preceeding period of
   time (e.g., the data for the month of April 2001 compared to that of
   March 2001).

   BTS would like feedback about this report. Please contact us with your
   comments.
