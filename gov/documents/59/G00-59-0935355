NCEP Operational AVN T170 - North American Graphics

     The current forecast cycle is 12Z 01/30/2002 ; graphics finished at
                                12:24:35 EST

   The operational AVN T170 is run four times per day (00,06,12,18Z) on
   the IBM-SP computer. Graphics are plotted using GrADS software. Data is
   interpolated to 1x1 degree resolution. The 00 and 12Z runs are 126 hr
   forecasts, while the 06 and 18Z runs are 84 hr forecasts. The 90-126
   hour plots for the 00 and 12Z runs wi ll remain available at off times
   for comparison purposes (old 90 hr to new 84 hr , etc.) until graphics
   for the next 126 hr on-time run are completed and transfe rred.

   All plots are on a north pole stereographic grid, using a domain that
   will include enough of the eastern Pacific to allow forecasters to
   check how well the data assimilation initialized the AVN, and to give
   Western Region forecasters a heads-up on potential incoming storms
   beyond the forecast period.
