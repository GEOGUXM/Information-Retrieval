       Virtual Cybernetic Building Testbed (VCBT)

       Principal Investigator: Cheol Park   Revised:

         __________________________________________________________________

       Objective:

       To develop a real-time, distributed Cybernetic Building Emulator called
       the Virtual Cybernetic Building Testbed (VCBT). The VCBT will consist
       of a variety of simulation models combined with commercial and
       prototype BACnet controllers that create a hybrid software/hardware
       environment suitable for testing various integrated control system
       components for cybernetic buildings. The VCBT also simulates fault
       conditions for use in testing fault detection and diagnostics (FDD)
       technology. An additional objective is to improve the state-of-the-art
       for building simulation tools by integrating traditionally stand alone
       simulation tools.

       Problem:

       The dynamic interactions of integrated control systems in a cybernetic
       building are not well understood. With the increasing pressure to
       integrate more building control systems and services, there is a
       desperate need to test and evaluate the complex interactions likely to
       occur under normal and adverse (i.e. emergency) operating situations.
       Control manufactures and service providers need assistance in the
       development, testing, and certification of new products. These tasks
       cannot be accomplished using real buildings because of the complexity
       of the systems involved and the need to maintain a comfortable and safe
       building environment for occupants at all times. They can only be done
       through simulation/emulation and the establishment of a Cybernetic
       Building Testbed where manufacturers can bring the actual control
       products under development, obtain assistance in testing and evaluating
       their performance, and perform interoperability tests with other
       manufacturers.

       Approach:

       The VCBT was created using a distributed simulation environment and a
       commercial data acquisition system to link the simulations to real
       building control hardware. The simulation portion is made up from
       separate HVAC, fire model, and network analysis simulation tools
       previously developed by NIST. The simulations are linked using the
       common object request broker architecture (CORBA).
       A sophisticated graphical user front-end based on virtual reality
       modeling language (VRML) provides the user interface to the testbed.
       The user interface will eventually allow researchers and service
       providers would be able to use the VCBT, either onsite or remotely, to
       study system interactions, evaluate control algorithms, and test the
       performance of new services.
       Fault models have been developed for common HVAC system components and
       included in the VCBT to provide a controlled and reproducible
       environment for testing and evaluating fault detection and diagnostic
       tools.
       Future enhancements will include the expansion of the VCBT to include
       the emulation of new building services, such as building/utility
       interactions, load aggregation, and other services likely to be
       provided by outside service companies.
       The VCBT will serve as a tool for testing building product information
       modeling concepts being developed by the International Alliance for
       Interoperability and others. The models will be implemented in the VCBT
       and used to drive the simulations needed for product testing. The
       models will also be used in the future to investigate the automation of
       configuration and commissioning of cybernetic building system products.
       The VCBT will be used to investigate and test sensor driven fire models
       that will be a key component in future smart fire panels.
       The simulation requirements of the VCBT will be used as the starting
       point for developing a new generation of building simulation tools that
       can more accurately predict the complex interactions of building
       systems under a variety of operating conditions.
