              Federal Pay Information for Ames Research Center

       Salaries of the federal government's "white collar" workers are
       fixed by the President under law. The pay of federal "blue collar"
       workers is fixed by lead agencies under 5 U.S.C. 5343. Other
       segments of the work population may have other pay scales - for
       example, Senior Executives. Many laws, regulations, policies and
       procedures can affect an individual's pay. Specific questions
       should be addressed to the emloyee's civilian personnel office.
       For most "white collar" workers, pay is based on some form of the
       General Schedule. Although this schedule is a nation-wide pay
       scale, locality pay and other rate adjustments may apply to certain
       locations. Many employees at Ames Research Center are under some
       type of Special Rate, variations of the General Schedule.
