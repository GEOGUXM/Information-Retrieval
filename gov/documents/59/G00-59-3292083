      related programs. The source imagery is SPOT Panchromatic (black and
      white) 10-meter resolution data.

      Two statewide editions of the SPOTView products are available:
      1992-1994 and 1998-2000. The index graphic below indicates the CD
      organization for both editions. The images are provided in Albers
      projection - NAD 27 datum (DFG standard).
      DFG employees - please determine the particular editions and CD numbers
      that you need. Then contact Will Patterson (916-323-1484,
