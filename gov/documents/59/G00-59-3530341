       Welcome to the Southern Region of the National Weather Service

   X. William Proenza - NWS Southern Region Director The Southern Region
   encompasses one-quarter of the land of the contiguous United States.
   This area includes ten states beginning with New Mexico and eastward
   across Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee,
   Alabama, Georgia and Florida, plus the commonwealth of Puerto Rico and
   the U.S. Virgin Islands in the eastern Caribbean. In this large area
   over 72 million people reside with over 150 million visitors annually.
   In addition, our coastal responsibilities include major areas of the
   Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and that portion of the Atlantic Ocean
   that we border.
   No region of the National Weather Service offers more meteorological
   fascination and challenges than the Southern Region. In fact, the
   Southern Region alone receives...
     * One third of all the rainfall in the USA,
     * Half of the nation's severe thunderstorm, flash flood and tornado
       events,
       and by far,
     * The greatest number of tropical storm landfalls.

   In short, the Southern Region encompasses an area that is home to the
   most active weather in the world.
   With our national public safety mission and support to the economic
   well being of our Nation, a career in the Southern Region can certainly
   offer great personal satisfaction to each and every employee. This
   region has an outstanding team of just under 1000 field employees in
   its 31 forecast offices, 4 river forecast centers, 7 Center Weather
   Service Units, the Spaceflight Meteorology Group, the FAA Academy
   instructors, several weather service offices and, of course, the
   Southern Region Headquarters.
   The Southern Region Headquarters provides vital operational
   "around-the-clock" support to its field offices and manages the
   region's programs, scientific enhancements, staffing and annual
   financial budget of over 85 million dollars, plus a multitude of
   technological developments and implementations, meteorological and
   hydrologic program management, recruitment, promotion and employee
   development, quality control of all field services and operational
   prioritizing and evaluation of field needs. All this is done more
   efficiently through the centralization of operational support and
   management by the regional headquarters and thereby avoiding the need
   for further support staff in the many field offices.
   The Southern Region's most valuable resource is the tremendous teamwork
   of its nearly 1000 professionals operationally focused in the delivery
   and support of our life saving weather warnings and forecasts mission,
   protection of natural resources, and vital services to the nation's
   commerce on land, sea and air.
   Thank you for your interest in the National Weather Service Southern
   Region.
   Bill Proenza
   Director
