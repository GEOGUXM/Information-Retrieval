     Breast cancer continues to rob women of their health, their
     productivity, and their very lives. It robs families of mothers,
     grandmothers, sisters, aunts, wives, and partners. In 2001 alone, an
     estimated 192,200 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast
     cancer, and more than 40,200 women will be lost to this disease.
     Breast cancer strikes women of all ages, races, ethnicities,
     socioeconomic strata, and geographic locales; however, older women,
     African Americans, the poor, and others with limited health care
     access are disproportionately affected. Male breast cancer, because
     of its rarity, is most often treated according to the lessons
     learned from studying the disease in women....

     The report of the Breast Cancer Progress Review Group presents in
     detail the recommendations both for overarching areas of research
     emphasis and for achieving progress in each of the major disciplines
     engaged in breast cancer research. In addition, key breast cancer
     statistics and a listing of on- line resources for breast cancer
     information are included as appendices to the report.
