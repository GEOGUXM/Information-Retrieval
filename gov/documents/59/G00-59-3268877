   Become a USGS Business Partner Retailer

      The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) seeks private sector organizations to
      become distributors of its map and geospatial data products. These
      include topographic maps and other published products, digital
      cartographic data, aerial photographs, and digital satellite imagery
      (Landsat 7). If you are interested in becoming a distributor of one or
      more of these product lines, please read on.

      Through participating in the Business Partner Program, businesses
      receive several benefits from USGS. These include bulk purchase prices,
      priority order processing, customer referrals, links to Business
      Partner web pages from USGS pages, and dedicated USGS customer service
      points of contact.

      Nearly all USGS products are in the public domain, meaning there are no
      copyright restrictions placed upon them. Business partner retailers can
      distribute USGS products either as they were produced, or with
      enhancements to suit custom applications.

      For more information, or to obtain a packet of information on a
      specific product line, click on the Contacts button.
