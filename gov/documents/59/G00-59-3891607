   Walden to Visit Guantanamo Bay, Cuba with Congressional Delegation to Inspect
Taliban and al Qaeda Detention Facilities

Visit to Camp X-Ray part of congressional delegation to evaluate treatment of
                      prisoners captured in Afghanistan

   WASHINGTON, D.C. U.S. Congressman Greg Walden (R-OR) will travel to the
   U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on Friday, January 25 as
   part of a U.S. congressional delegation to tour Camp X-Ray, the
   facility being used to hold prisoners of the U.S. war on terrorism who
   were captured in Afghanistan.  Currently 158 Taliban and al Qaeda
   fighters are being housed at Camp X-Ray in temporary units while more
   secure, permanent detention facilities are being constructed.  275
   additional prisoners are still under U.S. military control in
   Afghanistan.

   There have been a number of media reports in recent days questioning
   whether the treatment of the Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners were
   holding in Guantanamo Bay has been in violation of international law,
   said Walden.  The purpose of our trip is to see for ourselves the
   conditions theyre being held in and determine whether these allegations
   have any merit.  Im confident that these prisoners are being treated
   humanely and that the nourishment and medical care weve provided for
   them not only surpasses what many countries would provide in similar
   circumstances, but is better than what they were receiving prior to
   their capture.  Nevertheless, we need to ensure that this is the case.
   Its important for the United States to maintain the moral high ground
   in the war on terrorism and not sink to the level of our enemies.

   John Walker Lindh, the American Taliban fighter captured in
   Afghanistan, is not among the prisoners at Camp X-Ray.  He was
   transferred from the U.S. warship Bataan on January 23 to detention
   facilities in Alexandria, VA.  He will be tried in federal court in the
   Northern District of Virginia on charges of conspiring to kill U.S.
   nationals and providing support to al Qaeda.

   Congressman Walden represents the Second Congressional District of
   Oregon, which includes the 20 counties of southern, central and eastern
   Oregon. Rep. Walden is a member of the House Energy and Commerce
   Committee and The House Committee on Resources
