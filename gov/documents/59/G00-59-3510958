   Privacy & Legal Notice

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

   November 26, 2001

   Dear Neighbor:

   On the back of this letter is a Public Notice about changes LLNL has
   asked the State of California to make in the permit for our hazardous
   waste management operations. The Public Notice covers two kinds of
   change requests. The first (referred to as a Class 1* modification)
   includes minor administrative changes. These have to do with training
   required to safely and properly handle hazardous waste. Public
   notification of these changes is required before the State can grant
   approval.

   LLNL wants to update training methods to include web- and
   computer-based courses. It also wants to make it easier to provide
   alternate courses that contain the same material but use a different
   instructional method. This will let the Laboratory use the best
   available technology to provide the most current content for its
   training.

   The second kind of change requested (referred to as Class 2
   modifications) require a public comment period and public meeting as
   part of the State's approval process. One of these changes would let
   LLNL store solid wastes closer together since these wastes are stored
   in containers that are approved by the Department of Transportation,
   are closed or sealed, and are rated to not spill their contents even if
   dropped from a height of four feet.

   The other change would allow the storage of 32 waste types for up to a
   year before shipping them off-site for appropriate disposal. These
   wastes types are already managed at LLNL for a period of 90 days or
   less. These wastes are usually generated in very small quantities.

   Both requested changes increase cost-effectiveness without compromising
   safety, public health, or protection of the environment.

   The complete permit modification request to the state will be available
   in the LLNL environmental repositories located at the Livermore Public
   Library and the LLNL Visitors Center. It will also be available shortly
   after December 20 at http://www-envirinfo.llnl.gov/

   A public meeting to discuss these last two changes will be held on
   January 3, 2002 at 2:00 p.m. in the LLNL Visitors Center auditorium.
   Public comments to the DTSC on these changes may be made through
   January 31, 2002 to the individual shown on the Public Notice.

   Please let me know if you have any questions on the requests or any
   other matters. You can call me at (925)424-4026 or e-mail me at
   heffner1@llnl.gov .

   Sincerely,

   H.F. Heffner, Manager
   Environmental Community Relations

   CLASS 1* (REQUIRING PRIOR DEPARTMENT APPROVAL) AND CLASS 2 MODIFICATION
                                   REQUEST
                    HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITIES
                   LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY
                           EPA ID #: CA 2890090002

   On November 19, 2001, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)
   notified the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) of its
   request to modify the Livermore Site Hazardous Waste Management
   Facility Permit, the Part A, and the Part B Permit Operation Plan
   (Volumes 1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11). The Operation Plan describes, in detail,
   hazardous waste management operations and activities for the facility.

   The Permit modification request included a Class 1, Class 1*, and a
   Class 2 modification. The Class 1 permit modification includes minor,
   administrative changes and may be implemented without formal public
   comment, pursuant to Title 22, California Code or Regulations (CCR),
   section 66270.42(a). The Class 1 modification is not specifically
   addressed in this notice.

   The Class 1* modification also includes minor, administrative changes
   but requires prior approval by DTSC. The Class 1* modification
   submitted at this time includes 15 separate items within the Part B
   Training Plan summarized as follows:

   - Revise the training plan to allow the development and use of training
   courses using alternate methods and media, such as web and computer
   based courses, for specific courses described in the Part B Permit,
   Volume 5, Appendix VII-B, Waste Management Training Program Course
   Descriptions. This modification also seeks to allow LLNL to add new
   course titles to the Part B to indicate the method or type of media
   used (e.g., -W to indicate a web-based course) as long as the courses
   are considered alternates to existing courses.

   - The remaining Class 1* modifications are associated with the Part B
   Permit training requirements. LLNL is proposing to remove training
   courses from personnel training plans for positions that no longer
   perform the activities that require the training, remove courses from
   training plans when course material is included in other training
   courses, remove a course that was inadvertently included and replace it
   with a more appropriate course, and remove courses for equipment or
   facilities that are not in use and not slated for future use.

   Pursuant to 22 CCR 66270.42 (b), Class 2 modifications must be formally
   presented to the public during a 60-day public comment period and a
   public meeting in addition to this notice. The public meeting location,
   date/time, and contact names/phone numbers are provided at the end of
   this notice. Class 2 modifications include:

   - Modify the language of LLNL's Hazardous Waste Facility Permit, Page
   13, 9 (f). Modify the language to read: Incompatible solid wastes may
   be stored in the same containment area if kept separated by a distance
   of at least (delete: 8 feet) (insert) 2.5 feet. The proposed change in
   text provides consistent requirements for appropriate segregation for
   storage of incompatible solid waste. The primary acids that LLNL
   manages in this category are hydrochloric and hydrofluoric. Because
   LLNL manages these wastes in varying concentrations, LLNL has
   determined that the concentration levels of these two acids become
   reactive at greater than or equal to 18.6 and 5.5 per cent
   respectively. This is based on guidance and suggestions from DTSC,
   engineering evaluations and published scientific data.

   - LLNL proposes to modify the Part A Permit, EPA Form 8700-23 by adding
   the following thirty-two new EPA Hazardous Waste Codes: P128, P185,
   P188, P189. P190, P191, P192, P194, P196, P197, P198, P199, P201, P202,
   P203, P204, P205, U278, U279, U280, U364, U367, U372, U373, U387, U389,
   U394, U395, U404, U409, U410, and U411. Process codes S01, S02, will
   also be added to each EPA Waste Code on EPA Form 8700-23. The new list
   of EPA Hazardous Waste Codes was included in Part 62, CFR, Section
   32977 on June 17, 1997. Currently, if such waste types are generated
   onsite, they must be sent directly offsite following storage in a
   less-than 90-day Waste Accumulation Area (WAA).
