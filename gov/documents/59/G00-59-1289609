                                    ICANS
           International Collaboration on Advanced Neutron Sources

   ICANS is an informal network of laboratories whose scientists are
   involved in developing pulsed neutron sources and accelerator based
   spallation neutron sources.

Brief History of ICANS

   ICANS originated in discussions that took place in 1977 at Argonne
   National Laboratory among John M. Carpenter of Argonne National
   Laboratory, Rex G. Fluharty of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, Leo C.
   W. Hobbis of Rutherford Laboratory, and Motoharu Kimura, representing
   Tohoku University and the Japanese National Laboratory for High Energy
   Physics (KEK). They formulated the goals and structure of the
   Collaboration, described below as they have since been slightly
   modified. T. O. Brun and J. M. Carpenter share blame for the "ICANS"
   acronym.

   ICANS meetings began in 1977 with a gathering at Argonne. A second was
   held at Rutherford Laboratory in 1978, and a "mini-ICANS" meeting, held
   jointly between KEK and Rutherford Laboratory scientists, took place at
   Rutherford Laboratory in 1979. None of these sessions was reported in
   any published document. Subsequent meetings have all been reported in
   proceedings. Altogether there have been twelve major ICANS meetings up
   to 1994. About 125 scientists have attended each of the recent ICANS
   meetings.
   Related similar topical collaborations and series of meetings have
   recently been established, the Advanced Pulsed Neutron Sources (PANS)
   conferences convened by the Frank Laboratory of Neutron Physics, JINR,
   Dubna, and the International Group on Research Reactors (IGORR)
   meetings.

Goals and Structure of ICANS

   The attention of the Collaboration is on the subjects of accelerator
   development, source (target) and moderator development, and neutron
   scattering instrumentation development. The collaboration has the
   following goals:
     * to facilitate the exchange of technical information
     * to provide for review of results and designs
     * to reduce duplication of efforts
     * to identify areas for collaborative efforts, and
     * to provide means for informing participants about plans for
       activities relating to pulsed and steady spallation source
       development.

   Meetings are normally of four or five days duration and are held about
   every two years. Efforts are made to coordinate ICANS meetings with
   other events in order to minimize the costs and other impacts of
   travel. Usually, meetings address two of the three subject areas,
   always including the topic of targets and moderators. Meetings are only
   loosely structured, including brief status reports from each of the
   active laboratories, contributed papers from the participants, and
   sometimes poster sessions. Ideally, meetings provide substantial time
   for workshop sessions and informal discussions. Always, meetings end
   with "how did we do?" discussions and planning for forthcoming
   meetings.

   It is the tradition within the Collaboration that each of the
   participating laboratories identifies an "ICANS Contact" who serves to
   communicate with the Collaboration on behalf of the laboratory.
   Normally responsibility for playing host to meetings rotates among the
   participating laboratories and is decided by discussions among the
   contacts one or two cycles before the planned meeting. Responsibility
   for coordinating events rests with the host of the next upcoming
   meeting, and the host laboratory takes responsibility for timely
   publication of proceedings and for supporting other conference costs.
   Otherwise, the Collaboration is quite informal. For early meetings,
   there was no fee for participation in ICANS meetings. This policy was
   changed as of ICANS XIII (1995) due to the growing burden on the host
   laboratory because of participants from non-member laboratories.
   Attendance is by invitation from the host through the member laboratory
   ICANS Contacts.

   The tradition is that the directors of the member laboratories send a
   letter to the director of any new laboratory that wishes to join in the
   Collaboration; these are shepherded by the ICANS Contacts. A new member
   laboratory must be willing to accept host responsibilities. Initial
   expressions of interest should be addressed to the ICANS Contact of the
   next-host laboratory.
