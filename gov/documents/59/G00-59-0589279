   Are you ready to learn?


                                                               Seattle SOC

   Imagine a field trip to an aquariumbut not to just any aquarium. This
   one is different. This time you get to see behind the scenes. You get
   to talk to the professionals - the ones who run the aquarium, the ones
   who do the research, the ones who work for local, state and even
   federal agencies to make and uphold conservation laws. You get to meet,
   firsthand, the individuals who are making conservation happen. You even
   get to tell them your opinions about coastal conservation and
   management.

   Student Ocean Conferences are funded by the National Geographic
   Society's (NGS) Geographic Education Foundation in collaboration with
   the Sustainable Seas Expedition (SSE), and Coastal America and its
   Coastal Ecosystem Learning Centers (CELCs) and federal partner
   agencies.

   While those of us in the profession understand the plight of the
   coastal and marine environments, the general public is hard-pressed to
   understand why the vast ocean and its inhabitants are in any serious
   danger. Similarly, while most Americans understand the role of, and
   even the need for, national and state parks, very few are aware of the
   importance of protecting and managing marine natural resources.

   In an effort to educate the public about these marine issues, Coastal
   America's CELCs, in collaboration with the SSE and Coastal America
   federal agency partners, have received a grant from the NGS Geographic
   Education Foundation to reach out to students of coastal communities
   across the country. The venue for this collaborative effort is known as
   the Student Ocean Conference, and the objective is to educate and
   empower students about protection of the marine environment.

   Student Ocean Conferences will be hosted at the various CELCs around
   the country over the next several years. While each conference will be
   unique, highlights might include such things as interaction with local
   federal agency professionals involved in marine management,
   conservation, and sanctuaries; discussion sessions for students to
   relate their own experiences and insights; and a session with a leader
   in regional or national marine conservation issues, in most cases Dr.
   Sylvia Earle.


   The next Student Ocean Conferences will occur on Nov. 29 - 30, 2001 at
       the Texas State Aquarium and on December 11, 2001 at the Mystic
                                  Aquarium.
