   Partnerships

   Soil & water conservation is delivered through a unique partnership of
   federal, state, and local agencies. Few partnerships in the nation are
   as strong as the one in North Carolina. The USDA Natural Resources
   Conservation Service provides technical assistance to local soil and
   water conservation districts. The NRCS brings highly trained,
   professional conservationists with broad, national experience and
   backing. The NRCS also administers several federal programs designed to
   help landowners install conservation practices that protect soil
   resources, improve water quality, protect wetlands, and provide habitat
   for wildlife.

   Districts bring the local perspective. Headed by a three to five-person
   board of supervisors, districts determine local priorities and
   administer state conservation programs. In North Carolina, districts
   provide additional conservationists of their own, who work side-by-side
   with those of the NRCS. Districts speak with a unified voice through
   the NC Association of Soil & Water Conservation Districts.

   The state, through the Department of Environment and Natural
   Resources-Division of Soil & Water Conservation and other agencies,
   provides funds and program support. The North Carolina Agricultural
   Cost-Share Program, funded by the state and administered through soil &
   water conservation districts, has provided millions of dollars to help
   landowners install conservation measures that reduce water pollution
   from agricultural non-point sources. The Division of Soil & Water
   Conservation takes its direction from the North Carolina Soil & Water
   Conservation Commission.

   Beyond these core agencies and organizations, the North Carolina
   conservation partnership works closely with other state and federal
   agencies, like the Cooperative Extension Service, the USDA Farm
   Services Agency, the NC Division of Environmental Management, the NC
   Department of Agriculture, and the NC Division of Forest Resources.
   Private organizations like the Farm Bureau and Sierra Club are also
   included in the partnershipÂ’s decision making process.

   The ultimate partner is the people of North Carolina. With the help of
   the conservation partnership, thousands of landowners and land users
   have voluntarily installed conservation systems that protect and
   improve our soil, water, air, and wildlife resources.
