   Certified Wetland Determinations

        Certified wetland determinations offer landowners the assurance of
   final wetland determinations based on the wetland types on their lands.
   A certified determination will not change for USDA purposes as long as
   the site remains in agricultural use (if no violations occur). The
   Natural Resources Conservation Service makes certified wetland
   determinations/delineations upon written request.

   Certification of Previous Wetland
   Determinations/Delineations
       Previous wetland determinations/delineations should be certified
   because:
       q Landowners are entitled to certified wetland determinations under
   the 1996 Farm Bill.
       q Certified wetland determinations are recognized by USDA and the
   U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the Food Security Act and Section 404
   of the Clean Water Act.
       q Some previous determinations are inadequate under current laws
   and regulations.

   Obtaining Wetland Determinations/Delineations
       Requests must be made in writing (form NRCS-CPA-38). Since
   certified determinations are now valid for the Clean Water Act, it is
   important landowners have accurate determinations based on available
   technology and tools. Landowners planning to fill, drain, level, clear
   or manipulate areas on their land should ask for certified
   determinations/delineations to maintain USDA eligibility and compliance
   with the Clean Water Act.
       Prior to land manipulation or land clearing, USDA farm program
   participants must complete a revised form AD-1026 at the Farm Service
   Agency office and request a certified wetland determination (form
   NRCS-CPA-38). NRCS will provide a certified wetland determination and
   advice about planned activities. Landowners may also obtain wetland
   determinations/delineations without any immediate plans for activity in
   or around a wetland.
       All wetland determinations will be provided in writing. Landowners
   may appeal determinations, provided no appeal has previously been filed
   for the determination in question.

   Small Pockets & Narrow Bands
   Determinations/Delineations
        Wetland determinations are made for a whole tract of land,
   including small pockets, narrow bands and other nonagricultural areas;
   however, some areas may be labeled "Not Inventoried" if the landowner
   does not plan manipulation on portions of the tract. The landowner
   should contact the USDA office if future manipulations are planned.

   Technical Errors
       If NRCS discovers a technical error in a previous determination,
   the landowner will be informed of the error and given the opportunity
   to request a corrected determination.

   For More Information
       NRCS, FSA, Cooperative Extension Service and Conservation Districts
   can provide more information. USDA Service Centers are listed in the
   telephone book under U.S. Department of Agriculture.

                        Minimal Effect Determinations

   Definition
        Minimal Effect is a determination that the conversion or proposed
   conversion action of a wetland will have an insignificant effect on the
   hydrologic and biologic functions and values of the wetland.

   Purpose
        The wetland conservation provisions of the 1996 Farm Bill allow
   landowners to produce agricultural commodities even if their actions
   involve converting a wetland, as long as there is only a minor impact
   on the functions and values of the landowner’s wetland and other
   wetlands in the area. A minimal effect determination provides
   landowners with information that is useful in making decisions about
   wetlands conversion that relate to U.S. Department of Agriculture farm
   program eligibility.

   USDA Program Eligibility
        A landowner will maintain USDA farm program eligibility for
   actions associated with the conversion of a wetland or the production
   of an agricultural commodity on a converted wetland if the action will
   have a minimal effect on the hydrologic and biologic functions of the
   wetlands in the area.

   Categorical Minimal Effect Determinations
        A list of activities and practices that have minimal effect on
   wetland functions and values for the local area will be developed.
   Categorical minimal effect exemptions enable landowners to conduct
   these activities with immediate approval while maintaining eligibility
   for USDA programs. A list of categorical minimal effect activities and
   practices will be available in the local Natural Resources Conservation
   Service office when developed.

   Applying for a Minimal Effect Determination
        USDA has personnel trained in conducting minimal effect
   determinations. The landowner may request a conservationist to visit
   the wetland, discuss the proposed action, and determine if effects are
   minimal.

   For More Information
        NRCS, Farm Service Agency, Cooperative Extension Service, or your
   local conservation district can provide more information. Your USDA
   Service Center is listed in the telephone book under U.S. Department of
   Agriculture.

   Mitigation

        Notice: This information is based on the Interim Final Rule for
   Highly Erodible Land and Wetland Conservation published in the Federal
   Register, Sept. 6, 1996. The information contained herein is subject to
   change in the Final Rule. The rule can be viewed on the Internet at
   http://www.nrcs.usda.gov.

   Introduction
        The 1996 Farm Bill made several changes to existing wetland
   conservation provisions that give landowners more flexibility in
   meeting requirements while protecting natural resources. The new law
   expands areas where mitigation can be used and provides more options
   for mitigation of lost wetland functions and values through
   restoration, enhancement, or creation. Mitigation is allowed on most
   wetland types of any size, provided equivalent functions and values are
   maintained.

   Definitions
        Mitigation is compensation through wetland restoration,
   enhancement, or creation for functions and values that are lost on a
   converted wetland.
       Restoration of a wetland means the re-establishment of wetland
   conditions, including hydrologic conditions or native hydrophytic
   vegetation, to an area where a wetland had previously existed.
       Enhancement of a wetland means the alteration of an existing
   wetland to increase its specific functions and values. Enhancement
   includes new capabilities, management options, structures, or other
   actions that influence one or more functions and values.
       Creation of a wetland means the development of the hydrologic,
   geochemical, and biological components necessary to support and
   maintain a wetland where a wetland did not previously exist. Any
   wetland established on a non-hydric soil will be considered a created
   wetland.

   Exemption
        A landowner will be exempt from wetland conservation provisions if
   conversion of the wetland functions and values is mitigated by the
   landowner through restoration of a converted wetland, enhancement of an
   existing wetland, or creation of equivalent wetland functions and
   values on a new site in the area.

   Requirements
        The restoration, enhancement, or creation is done according to a
   mitigation plan approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
   Natural Resources Conservation Service.
        q The mitigation provides the equivalent functions and values that
   will be lost as a result of the wetland conversion.
        q The mitigation occurs before or at the same time as the wetland
   conversion or production of an agricultural commodity.
        q The mitigation is not at the expense of the Federal Government
   (except as part of a USDA-designated mitigation banking pilot project).
        q Wetlands mitigated are in the same general area of the local
   watershed as the converted wetlands, which includes regional mitigation
   banks.
