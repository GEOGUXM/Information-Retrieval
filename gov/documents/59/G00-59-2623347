                                 Our Mission

     The NIST Metallurgy Division is working closely with materials
     suppliers and users to develop the measurement and standards
     infrastructure needed in diverse technological areas - from
     steelmaking to the fabrication of nanostructured multilayers for
     magnetic recording heads. As a result of global competition and the
     consumer's expectations of ever-increasing performance and
     reliability at lower cost, U.S. industry is making fundamental
     changes in the ways that new products are developed and manufactured
     and in the ways that materials are used. At the core of these
     changes is the need by both the metals producers and users for new
     measurements that make possible more accurate predictions of
     materials performance, manufacturability, and long-term reliability.

     The Metallurgy Division maintains core competence in a range of
     materials science and metallurgy disciplines within the structure of
     five separate groups: Electrochemical Processing, Magnetic
     Materials, Materials Performance, Materials Structure and
     Characterization, and Metallurgical Processing. The Division's
     projects require a wide range of expertise and, therefore, cut
     across formal group boundaries. Likewise, many major MSEL programs
     involve collaboration among scientists from several Divisions.
