      Office of K-16 Initiatives & Access Programs

   The Office of K-16 Initiatives and Access Programs administers over 115
   million dollars in grants, contracts and scholarships to colleges and
   universities; schools, school districts and BOCES; community based and
   non-profit organizations; and students.  The Office provides technical
   assistance on innovative strategies to:  (1) Improve college graduation rates
   for ethnic, cultural and other underrepresented and or disadvantaged
   students; and (2) Close the gap for students in need of academic intervention
   services to meet the Regents graduation requirements.
   To accomplish this, the Office of K-16 Initiatives and Access Programs
   coordinates its efforts through five operational units.  They are:


   Pre-Collegiate Preparation Programs Unit
    Teacher Recruitment and Development Unit
     Collegiate and Pre-Professional Unit
           Grants Administration Unit
         Scholarship Processing Unit

The Office of K-16 Initiatives and Access Programs contributes its resources to
ensure an educational system for New York State that provides all participants
with the tools, resources, opportunities and experiences necessary to be
successful learners, to reach their highest potential and to become full
contributors to society.
