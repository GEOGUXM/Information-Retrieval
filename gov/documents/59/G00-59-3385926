                        Ultrasonic Actuators and Motors

   This homepage covers the advanced actuators activity of the JPL's NDEAA
   Technologies Lab.
   The initial phase of this effort was focused on ultrasonic motors. This
   part was done jointly with QMI (Costa Mesa, CA) and it was funded as a
   Telerobotic subtask of the Planetary Dextereous Manipulator (PDM) task
   that was managed by Dr. Hari Das. The Program Managers at JPL were Dr.
   Chuck Weisbin and later Dr. Samad Hayati and at NASA HQ, Code S, Dave
   Lavery. [usm-sim.gif]
