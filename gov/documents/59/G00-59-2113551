   RRDD's (R2D2) Vision . . .
          To lead the world in research and development focused on
          advancing weather radar technology for the detection of severe
          and hazardous weather.


   RRDD's (R2D2) Mission . . .
          To conduct research to advance weather radar technology and to
          develop and transfer applications, techniques, and new
          scientific understanding to the National Weather Service and
          other government, public and private organizations, enhancing
          their ability to provide short-term predictions and warnings of
          hazardous weather.
