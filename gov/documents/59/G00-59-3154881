   subscribing you to the list against your will, an e-mail message with a
   confirmation code will be sent to the address you specify in the form.
   Simply wait for this message to arrive, then follow the instructions to
   confirm the operation.

   Alternatively, you can login with your LISTSERV password (if you have
   one) and update your subscription interactively, without e-mail
   confirmation.
