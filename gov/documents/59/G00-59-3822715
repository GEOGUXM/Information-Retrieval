   District Emergency Shelters
   When conditions warrant, the DC Emergency Management agency will
   operate the established community-based emergency shelters for
   residents. Persons needing shelter are asked to bring clothing and
   sanitary supplies, pre-filled prescriptions and other medical needs,
   denture and eye care materials, and special dietary supplies or
   requirements. With the exception of guided dogs, pets are not permitted
   in the shelters.


   Emergency Service Sites (ESS)
   Should people be unable to contact the police because of telephone or
   electricity failures, the MPDC will have more than 125 Emergency
   Service Sites (ESS) located throughout the District -- in fire
   stations, community centers, local businesses and other locations.


   Home Guide to Emergency Preparedness (Portable Document Format

   Planning for any emergency requires considering everything that could
   happen when things that you rely on daily - like electricity, water,
   heat, air conditioning, telephone service and transportation - are
   interrupted or lost for a considerable amount of time. This home guide
   will help you prepare your home and family for most local emergency
   situations.
