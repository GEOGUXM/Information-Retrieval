    Manuscript Preparation

   Title page should include authors' full names and mailing addresses and
   the senior author's telephone and FAX number.

   Abstract should not exceed one double-spaced typed page. It should
   state the main scope of the research but emphasize its conclusions and
   relevant findings. Because abstracts are circulated by abstracting
   agencies, it is important that they represent the research clearly and
   concisely.

   Text must be typed double-spaced throughout. A brief introduction
   should portray the broad significance of the paper; the remainder of
   the paper should be divided into the following sections: Materials and
   methods, Results, Discussion (or Conclusions), and Acknowledgments.
   Headings within each section must be short, reflect a logical sequence,
   and follow the rules of multiple subdivision (i.e. there can be no
   subdivision without at least two items). The entire text should be
   intelligible to interdisciplinary readers; therefore, all acronyms,
   abbreviations, and technical terms should be spelled out the first time
   they are mentioned. The scientific names of species must be written out
   the first time they are mentioned; subsequent mention of scientific
   names may be abbreviated. Follow the U.S. Government Printing Office
   Style Manual (1984 ed.) and the CBE Style Manual (5th ed.) for
   editorial style, and the most current issue of the American Fisheries
   Society's Common and Scientific Names of Fishes from the United States
   and Canada for fish nomenclature. Dates should be written as follows:
   11 November 1991. Measurements should be expressed in metric units,
   e.g., metric tons as (t); if other units of measurement are used,
   please make this fact explicit to the reader. The numeral one (1)
   should be typed as a one, not as a lower-case el (l).

   Text footnotes should be numbered with Arabic numerals and typed on a
   separate sheet of paper. Footnote all personal communications,
   unpublished data, and unpublished manuscripts with full address of the
   communicator or author, or, as in the case of unpublished data, where
   the data are on file. Authors are advised to avoid references to
   nonstandard (gray) literature, such as internal, project, processed, or
   administrative reports, wherever possible. Where these references are
   used, please include whether they are available from NTIS (National
   Technical Information Service) or from some other public depository.

   Literature cited comprises published works and those accepted for
   publication in peer-reviewed literature (in press). Follow the name and
   year system for citation format. In the text, cite Smith and Jones
   (1977) or (Smith and Jones, 1977). If there is a sequence of citations,
   list chronologically: Smith, 1932; Green, 1947; Smith and Jones, 1985.
   Abbreviations of serials should conform to abbreviations given in
   Serial Sources for the BIOSIS Previews Database. Authors are
   responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all citations.

   Tablesshould not be excessive in size and must be cited in numerical
   order in the text. Headings should be short but ample enough to allow
   the table to be intelligible on its own. All unusual symbols must be
   explained in the table heading. Other incidental comments may be
   footnoted with italic numerals. Use asterisks for probability in
   statistical data. Because tables are typeset, they need only be
   submitted typed and formatted, with double-spaced legends. Zeros should
   precede all decimal points for values less than one.

   Figuresinclude line illustrations and photographs (or slides) and must
   be cited in numerical order in the text. Unless photographs are
   submitted on glossy paper with good contrast, we cannot guarantee a
   good final printed copy. Figures are to be labeled with author's name
   and number of figure. Use Times Roman font (upper and lowercase
   letters) to label within figures. Avoid vertical lettering except for
   y-axis labels. Zeros should precede all decimal points for values less
   than one. Figures may be submitted as computer software files (along
   with laser-printed copies), as photo-mechanical transfers (PMTs), or as
   high quality photographic prints. Send only xerox copies of figures to
   the Scientific Editor; original figures will be requested later when
   the manuscript has been accepted for publication. Figure legends should
   explain all symbols and abbreviations and should be double-spaced on a
   separate page at the end of the manuscript.

   Copyright law does not cover government publications; they fall within
   the public domain. If an author reproduces any part of a government
   publication in his work, reference to source is considered correct
   form.

    Submission

   Send printed copies (original and three copies) to the Scientific
   Editor:
   Dr. John V. Merriner
       Scientific Editor, Fishery Bulletin
       NOAA/NMFS/SEFSC
       101 Pivers Island Road
       Beaufort NC 02516

   Once the manuscript has been accepted for publication, you will be
   asked to submit a software copy of your manuscript to the
   Managing Editor. The software copy should be submitted in WordPerfect
   or Word format (in Word, save as Rich Text
   Format) and should be placed on a 3.5-inch disk that is double-sided,
   double or high density, and that is compatible with either
   DOS or Macintosh systems. Note: We are no longer able to accept ASCII
   text files.

   Copies of published articles and notes are available free of charge to
   the senior author (50 copies) and to his or her laboratory (50 copies).
   Additional copies may be purchased in lots of 100 when the author
   receives page proofs.
