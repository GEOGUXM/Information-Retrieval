   A calendar listing education events, contests and other opportunities
   for the public to get involved in NASA's space program. Solar System
   Exploration projects often sponsor contests to give the general public
   a chance to participate. You may be able to name a rover or lander. Or
   you may be able to put your name up in the stars and have it fly on one
   of the JPL spacecraft.

   Learn more about Mercury
   Being the closest planet to the sun, Mercury's daytime temperatures
   sizzle at 800 degrees, but with no atmosphere, at night it drops to
   about -300 degrees, making it a challenge to explore. Learn more about
   Mercury.
