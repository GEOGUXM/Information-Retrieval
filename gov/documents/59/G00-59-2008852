Eligible Users

   The computing and telecommunications services provided at Argonne
   National Laboratory are generally available to all members of the
   Laboratory, DOE, and other U.S. Government agencies served by
   arrangement.  In addition, other not-for-profit organizations may apply
   for permission to use these computing services.  Commercial firms are
   generally not eligible to use Argonne National Laboratory computing
   services.

Availability

   Networks and computers run continuously.  However, availability may be
   preempted for remedial or preventive maintenance and systems tests,
   especially during the early morning and weekend hours.

Basic Cost Center Access Charge

   The Basic Cost Center Access Charge was instituted to recover the costs
   of providing various services to the laboratory-wide computing
   community that are not recouped via other means. The monthly charge is
   applied to all cost centers regardless of the number of users.

Surcharge to non-ANL Users

   Outside users with computer accounts funded by DOE but not by ANL,
   incur a surcharge of approximately 19% for Laboratory general
   administrative expense.  Outside computer users not affiliated with DOE
   incur a combination of surcharges of approximately 53% for Laboratory
   general administrative expense, Laboratory general depreciation,
   depreciation of computing equipment, and DOE administrative expense.

Refunds

   Users are entitled to refunds of charges for resource usage that
   occurred as a result of hardware failure, system software failure,
   error on the part of the ECT staff, or similar circumstances beyond the
   user's control.   Such refunds will not cover the parts of the job that
   can reasonably be skipped or suppressed in a rerun. Refunds of less
   than $50.00 are not processed.  Regardless of the cause of the failure,
   no more than 15 minutes worth of CPU time will be refunded for a batch
   job.

   ECT routinely backs up all on-line data and maintains multiple cycles
   of backups.  However, ECT will not reimburse users for loss of data for
   any cause nor be responsible for consequences of such loss.  Refunds
   will not be given for the cost of recreating lost or damaged datasets.
   Refunds are also not provided for I/O errors on personal tape reels.
   To apply for a refund, users must fill out a Computer Refund Request
   form available from ECT Account Services Office 630-252-5425 or
   acctserv@anl.gov, and submit it with adequate supporting evidence to
   Account Services.  Requests are reviewed by ECT technical staff and,
   where appropriate, refunds are applied to the user's account at the end
   of the monthly billing cycle.

   Please direct questions regarding ECT rates to Account Services at
   acctserv@anl.gov or 630-252-5425.
