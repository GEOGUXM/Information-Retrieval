              Fact Sheet on the National Labor Relations Board

   What Is the NLRB?

   The National Labor Relations Board is an independent federal agency
   created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations
   Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers
   in the private sector. The statute guarantees the right of employees to
   organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain
   from all such activity. Generally applying to all employers involved in
   interstate commerce--other than airlines, railroads, agriculture, and
   government--the Act implements the national labor policy of assuring
   free choice and encouraging collective bargaining as a means of
   maintaining industrial peace. Through the years, Congress has amended
   the Act and the Board and courts have developed a body of law drawn
   from the statute.

   What Does the NLRB Do?

   In its statutory assignment, the NLRB has two principal functions: (1)
   to determine, through [secret-ballot elections,] the free democratic
   choice by employees whether they wish to be represented by a union in
   dealing with their employers and if so, by which union; and (2) to
   prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called [unfair labor practices,] by
   either employers or unions. The agency does not act on its own motion
   in either function. It processes only those charges of unfair labor
   practices and petitions for employee elections that are filed with the
   NLRB in one of its 52 Regional, Subregional, or Resident Offices.

   What Is the NLRB's Structure?

   The agency has two major, separate components. The Board itself has
   five Members and primarily acts as a quasi-judicial body in deciding
   cases on the basis of formal records in administrative proceedings.
   Board Members are appointed by the President to 5-year terms, with
   Senate consent, the term of one Member expiring each year. The current
   members of the Board are Peter J. Hurtgen (Chairman), Wilma B. Liebman,
   Michael J. Bartlett, and William B. Cowen. One seat is vacant. The
   General Counsel, appointed by the President to a 4-year term with
   Senate consent, is independent from the Board and is responsible for
   the investigation and prosecution of unfair labor practice cases and
   for the general supervision of the NLRB field offices in the processing
   of cases. Each Regional Office is headed by a Regional Director who is
   responsible for making the initial determination in cases arising
   within the geographical area served by the region.

   How Are Unfair Labor Practice Cases Processed?

   When an unfair labor practice charge is filed, the appropriate field
   office conducts an investigation to determine whether there is
   reasonable cause to believe the Act has been violated. If the Regional
   Director determines that the charge lacks merit, it will be dismissed
   unless the charging party decides to withdraw the charge. A dismissal
   may be appealed to the General Counsel's office in Washington, D.C.

   If the Regional Director finds reasonable cause to believe a violation
   of the law has been committed, the region seeks a voluntary settlement
   to remedy the alleged violations. If these settlement efforts fail, a
   formal complaint is issued and the case goes to hearing before an NLRB
   Administrative Law Judge. The judge issues a written decision that may
   be appealed to the five-Member Board in Washington for a final agency
   determination. The Board's decision is subject to review in a U.S.
   Court of Appeals. Depending upon the nature of the case, the General
   Counsel's goal is to complete investigations and, where further
   proceedings are warranted, issue complaints if settlement is not
   reached within 7 to 15 weeks from the filing of the charge. Of the
   total charges filed each year [about 35,000], approximately one-third
   are found to have merit of which over 90% are settled.

   What Authority Does NLRB Have to Secure Injunctive Relief from a Court?

   Section 10(j) of the National Labor Relations Act empowers the NLRB to
   petition a federal district court for an injunction to temporarily
   prevent unfair labor practices by employers or unions and to restore
   the status quo, pending the full review of the case by the Board. In
   enacting this provision, Congress was concerned that delays inherent in
   the administrative processing of unfair labor practice charges, in
   certain instances, would frustrate the Act's remedial objectives. In
   determining whether the use of Section 10(j) is appropriate in a
   particular case, the principal question is whether injunctive relief is
   necessary to preserve the Board's ability to effectively remedy the
   unfair labor practice alleged, and whether the alleged violator would
   otherwise reap the benefits of its violation.

   Under NLRB procedures, after deciding to issue an unfair labor practice
   complaint, the General Counsel may request authorization from the Board
   to seek injunctive relief. The Board votes on the General Counsel's
   request and, if a majority votes to authorize injunctive proceedings,
   the General Counsel, through his Regional staff, files the case with an
   appropriate Federal district court.

   In addition, Section 10(l) of the Act requires the Board to seek a
   temporary federal court injunction against certain forms of union
   misconduct, principally involving "secondary boycotts" and
   "recognitional picketing." Finally, under Section 10(e), the Board may
   ask a federal court of appeals to enjoin conduct that the Board has
   found to be unlawful.

   Glossary of NLRB Terms

   charge--An allegation made by an individual, employer or labor
   organization of an unfair labor practice under the Act. Charges are
   filed at NLRB's regional offices.

   complaint--If, after investigating a charge, the regional office finds
   merit and no settlement is reached, the Regional Director serves a
   complaint in the name of the Board stating the unfair labor practices
   and containing a notice of hearing before an Administrative Law Judge.
   The complaint does not constitute a finding of wrongdoing but raises
   issues to be decided by the judge.

   administrative law judge--As with other federal agencies (such as the
   Labor Department or Social Security Administration), the NLRB has a
   corps of judges who conduct hearings at which the parties present
   evidence. These judges work for the NLRB (i.e., they are not federal
   district court judges). Decisions of Administrative Law Judges can be
   appealed to the five-member Board in Washington, D.C.

   good faith bargaining--Section 8(d) of the Act states in part: "To
   bargain collectively is the performance of the mutual obligation of the
   employer and the representative of the employees to meet at reasonable
   times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other
   terms and conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an agreement
   or any question arising thereunder, and the execution of a written
   contract incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either
   party, but such obligation does not compel either party to agree to a
   proposal or require the making of a concession..."

   impasse--A deadlock in negotiating between management and officials
   over terms and conditions of employment. Whether an impasse in
   bargaining exists "is a matter of judgment," the Board said in its 1967
   decision in Taft Broadcasting Co. v. AFTRA, and depends on such factors
   as "bargaining history, the good faith of the parties in negotiations,
   the length of the negotiations, the importance of the issue or issues
   as to which there is disagreement, the contemporaneous understanding of
   the parties as to the state of negotiations."
