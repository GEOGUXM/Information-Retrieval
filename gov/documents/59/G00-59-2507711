   Search Help

   To find information about a topic, type in a few keywords. The more
   detailed your query, the more relevant your results.

   A search on "usa" will match "Usa", "USA", and "usA", while the term
   "USA" matches only its uppercase version.

   The asterisk is a powerful search tool, but has some limitations. It
   cannot span words - that is, the query "powerfu*earch" would not match
   the first sentence of this paragraph - and it can represent at most
   four letters or numbers. To avoid overly broad searches, the asterisk
   can only be used in words or phrases which have at least three
   alpha-numeric characters. A search for "th*" would be ignored.
