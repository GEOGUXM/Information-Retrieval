   Importance of Jury Service

      Jurors perform a very vital role in the American system of justice.
   The protection of our rights and liberties is largely achieved through
   the teamwork of judge and jury who, working together in a common
   effort, put into practice the principles of our great heritage of
   freedom. The judge determines the law to be applied in the case, while
   the jury decides the facts. Thus, in a very important way, jurors
   become a part of the court itself. Jurors must be persons possessed of
   sound judgment, absolute honesty, and a complete sense of fairness.
   Jury service is a high duty of citizenship. Jurors aid in the
   maintenance of law and order and uphold justice among their fellow
   citizens. Their greatest reward is the knowledge that they have
   discharged this duty faithfully, honorably, and well. In addition to
   determining and adjusting property rights, jurors may also be asked to
   decide questions involving a crime for which a person may be fined,
   placed on probation, or confined in prison.
   In a very real sense, therefore, the people must rely upon jurors for
   the protection of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
