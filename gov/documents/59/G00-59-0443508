     A Message From the Sheriff
     Graphic: Sheriff John Cupp

     My special thanks to the members of this department who recognized the
     value of a website.  This website can be used as a valuable tool to
     inform all who are interested in the productivity of the Hamilton
     County Sheriff’s Office.

     The various departments within the Sheriff’s Office participate in many
     projects throughout the year.  These projects highlighted on the
     website will allow interested citizens to learn details regarding these
     and other events taking place in Hamilton County.

     Our success is not the work of one individual, but the combined efforts
     of over 350 employees in each of the different divisions, such as,
     Civil Process, Corrections, Criminal Investigations, Criminal Records,
     DUI School, Fugitive, Jail Records, Narcotics, Patrol, Training
     Division and our special projects, such as DARE (Drug Awareness
     Resistance Education) and School Resource Officers (SRO).  We also have
     a cadre of support personnel that so often do not receive the
     recognition they deserve, but without them very little would be
     accomplished.

     Hamilton County covers over 550 square miles.  There are eight (8) law
     enforcement agencies operating in the incorporated areas of Hamilton
     County.  The Hamilton County jail, maintained by the Sheriff’s Office,
     serves all of these agencies as well as the Chattanooga City Police
     Department, State and Federal Agencies.  Presently we have certified
     officers working in the Criminal Investigations Division (CID),
     Fugitive Warrants Division, DARE, Narcotics, Patrol, SRO, and
     approximately 150 Deputies assigned to the Corrections Division.

     As I begin my seventh year as the Sheriff of Hamilton County, I feel
     fortunate to be surrounded by so many competent and dedicated people.
     May we continue to strive to make our community a thriving and safe
     place to live.


                                                                   Sincerely

                                                           John Cupp Sheriff
