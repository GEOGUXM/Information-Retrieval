   nothing Agenda

   The Artificial Intelligence Group performs basic research in the areas
   of Artificial Intelligence Planning and Scheduling, with applications
   to science analysis, spacecraft commanding, deep space network
   operations, and space transportation systems.

   Projects:Planning Technology

   [aspenleaf.gif] ASPEN (Automated Scheduling and Planning ENvironment)
   is a software framework which provides a reusable, reconfigurable
   library of components for typical P/S applications. [aps_thm.gif]
   Adaptive Problem Solving (APS) for Large Scale Scheduling and Resource
   Allocation Problems task involves the development of Machine Learning
   Methods to automatically find effective domain-specific scheduler
   control strategies. It is applied to the domains of spacecraft
   commanding and to Deep Space Network scheduling problems.
   [aspenleaf.gif] Benchmark Problem DomainsThe benchmark problem domains
   were developed and released in response to the disconnect between the
   research and application communities in planning and scheduling. The
   two actual space domains, DATA-CHASER and CX-1, developed at Colorado
   Space Grant, contain multiple levels of difficulty and simulators
   corresponding to these levels, in the hopes the the planning and
   scheduling community will direct research towards more real-world
   problems.

   [casper_thb.gif]
   CASPER (Continuous Activity Scheduling Planning Execution and
   Replanning) uses iterative repair to support continuous modification
   and updating of a current working plan in light of changing operating
   context. [clear_thm.gif] CLEaR (Closed Loop Execution and Recovery) is
   an integrated planning and execution framework for autonomous control
   of robotic entities. The CLEaR system currently utilizes CASPER and
   TDL, and focuses on on the use of both near-term reactive behavior and
   long-term deliberative decision making. Projects:Autonomous Aerial
   Vehicles
   [uavs_thb.gif] UAVs (Unmanned Air Vehicles) consist of integrating JPL
   planning, diagnostics, and prognostics systems as part of the control
   architecture for UAVs. nothing Additional Information

   Projects:Spacecraft Commanding
   [xsmall.gif] Citizen Explorer (CX1) is a small earth orbiting satellite
   built and managed by the Colorado Space Grant Consortium.
   [dist_space_thb.gif] Distributed Spacecraft
   See project page for more infomation. [techsat21-pic2.jpg] Techsat-21
   The Techsat-21 project consists of flying the Autonomous Sciencecraft
   Constellation flight experiment (ASC) onboard the Air Force Techsat-21
   constellation (an unclassified mission scheduled for launch in 2004).
   ASC will use on-board science analysis and replanning to redically
   increase science return by enabling intelligent downlink selection and
   autonomous retargeting. [3cs-unseparated.jpg] 3 Corner Sat The Three
   Corner Sat (3CS) satellite project is a mission being developed jointly
   by The University of Arizona (ASU), The University of Colorado, Boulder
   (CU), and New Mexico State University (NMSU). 3CS consists of three
   coordinated satellites that will be deployed in a stack configuration
   from the Space Shuttle and will then separate to form a "virtual
   formation."The goals of the 3CS mission include the demonstration of
   stereo imaging, formation flying and innovative command and data
   handling, including on-board autonomy.

   Projects: Rover Autonomy
   [sojourner2_thm.gif] Autonomous Rover Command Generation
   A proof-of-concept prototype for automatic generation of validated
   rover command sequences from high-level science and engineering
   activities. [rocky7.jpg] Onboard Planning for Rocky7
   No project page. [dist_rovers_thb.gif] Distributed Rovers
   This project develops and validates architectures and technologies for
   command and control of multi-rover groups for planetary exploration.

   Ground Station Autonomy
   [clear_thm.gif] DSSC (Deep Space Station Controller) is an extension to
   the work performed for the Deep Space Terminal (DS-T) task, part of the
   Deep Space Network, in the area of track automation. This work utilizes
   the CLEaR system to provide the capability for robust dynamic desision
   making and execution management for autonomous DSN ground station
   operations.
