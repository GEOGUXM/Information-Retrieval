   GEOMETRIC EFFECTS ON ALFVEN WAVES * Continuous spectrum, shear Alfvén
   resonance GEOMETRIC EFFECTS ON ALFVEN WAVES Add 2D toroidal effects: *
   Periodic boundary conditions for toroidal mode number, n, and poloidal
   mode number, m * m and m+1 are coupled and a "gap" is opened in the
   otherwise continuous spectrum GEOMETRIC EFFECTS ON ALFVEN WAVES Add
   elliptical cross-section effects: * m and m+2 are now coupled and an
   elliptical "gap" is opened in the continuous spectrum Add triangularity
   cross-section effects: * m and m+3 are now coupled and an triangularity
   "gap" is opened in the continuous spectrum GEOMETRIC EFFECTS ON ALFVEN
   WAVES Discrete Modes Appear in Gaps in the Continuum: * Alfvén wave
   continuum is strongly damped. * TAE gap-modes are less damped: free
   energy from p tapped by wave/particle resonance drive from -particles
   may destabilize these modes. BASIC ALFVEN EIGENMODE PHYSICS EXTENDS TO
   RANGE OF TOROIDAL CONFIGURATIONS Tokamak: Stellarator: Spherical Torus:
   * Details of spectra differ but underlying physics and modeling tools
   are common. New Alpha Effects Expected on Scale of Burning Plasma *
   Present experiments show alpha transport due to only a few global
   modes. * Smaller value of / in a Burning Plasma may lead to a "sea" of
   resonantly overlapping unstable modes & possible large alpha transport.
   * Reliable simulations not possible...needs experimental information in
   new regime. This and other alpha physics will be discussed in more
   detail in next talk by Bill Heidbrink... Q ~ 10: Strong Non-Linear
