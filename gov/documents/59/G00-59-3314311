   Trail Use & Precautions
   All trail users should be observant of changing trail conditions.
   Bicycle riders should wear safety helmets at all times.

   All trails are natural turf surface and are therefore continually
   changing and variable. Please use trails cautiously and in full
   control. Be prepared to stop for fallen tree limbs, rocks, etc.

   Please stay on trials. While trail surfaces are variable, turf
   conditions off of trails are uncertain at best. Location of trail users
   is also much more difficult when users leave trails.

   Always stay to the right of the trail to allow for on-coming traffic.

   Trail use is recommended with partners or groups. Always consider
   physical health when selecting trails and uses.

   Bicycling Use
   Off-road bicycling are recognized by Illinois statutes as hazardous
   recreational activities. All participation is at the participants own
   risk.

   Trail surfaces are not suitable for normal narrow tire bicycles.
   All-terrain bicycles with re-enforced frames and all-terrain tires are
   recommended. Bicycles are restricted to single file while using trails.
   Bicycles may not be operated in a manner or speed which endangers
   horses and pedestrians who always have the right-of-way.

   Cyclists must dismount at all bridges.

   EMERGENCIES:
   Report all injuries, accidents, and other emergencies to the park
   visitor center. When the visitor center is closed, call 911 or the
   Sheriff's Department at (309) 888-5000.
