   The USGS's National Water Information Center is designed to serve as a
          focus for the dissemination of water-resources information to
          all levels of government, academia, the private sector, and the
          general public.
          An "800" number is available for receiving water information
          requests by telephone. Services include referrals to appropriate
          sources of hydrologic information, as well as providing single
          copies of Fact Sheets on various water resources topics.
