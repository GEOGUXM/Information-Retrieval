    our website. The privacy of our customers is of utmost importance to
                                    NASA.

                         If you visit a NASA site...
     * To read or download information:

     We may collect and store information for statistical purposes. For
                               example, we may
    count the number of visitors to the different sections of our site to
                              help us make them
   more useful to visitors. Similar information is gathered for anonymous
                                 ftp, remote
        account login, or for other comparable types of connections.
     * To send us an E-mail:

       By sending us an electronic mail message, you may be sending us
                            personal information
     (e.g., name, address, E-mail address), as in an official Freedom of
                               Information Act
   request. We may store the name and address of the requester in order to

   Some of our sites ask visitors who request specific information to fill
                             out a registration
      form. For example, vendors looking for marketing opportunities by
                                visiting our
     Electronic Grants or NASA Acquisition Internet Service sites may be
                             asked to "register"
   to obtain copies of Requests for Proposals or other NASA opportunities.
                                    Other
          information which may be collected at these sites through
                          questionnaires, feedback
    forms, or other means, enable us to determine a visitor's interests,
                              with the goal of
                 providing better service to our customers.
