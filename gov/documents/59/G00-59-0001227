   Commonly Asked Questions About Age Determination of Fish
     * Question: Why is it important to age fish?
       Answer:Knowing the ages of fishes allows fisheries managers to
       understand the dynamics of fish stocks and how fish populations
       react to environmental stresses like commercial/sports fishing,
       natural mortality, and predation. Basically, it is a way to monitor
       and better manage stocks for long-term benefits.

     Question: How do you age a fish?
       Answer: The fishery biologist examines a structure of choice, which
       could be a scale, otolith, fin ray, dorsal spine, or vertebra.
       Generally the best structure to use is an otolith. An otolith is a
       bone located in a fish's skull and is analogous to the human
       earbone. For a more descriptive explanation of otoliths and their
       location in the body click here.
     * Question: Is there special equipment used to "read" otoliths?
       Answer: Yes, the basic equipment needed is as follows: dissecting
       microscope($1200-$8000), low speed saw($1500), diamond blade($120),
       alcohol burner($5), lighter($1), tweezers($12), teezing needle($7),
       petri dish($2), clay($1), mineral oil($1), dish soap($1), and
       paintbrush($1).
     Question: How do you actually age an otolith? Is it like counting
       tree rings?
       Answer: It is similar to counting tree rings, because the rings,
       called annuli, are formed annually.  However, the annuli are not
       always clearly visible on the entire otolith. Environmental factors
       such as water temperature, food supply, salinity, water chemistry,
       and population density can cause stress on the fish, and marks
       other than annuli can form on the otolith in response to these
       pressures. This can cause a complicated pattern that the biologist
       must interpret.
     Question: What is the age range of a typical flatfish?
       Answer: For a species like yellowfin sole, the oldest is around 32
       years. However, the average age is about 12 years of age.
     Question: How many otoliths can a biologist read in an 8-hour day?
       Answer: It depends on the species of fish, but generally around 40
       per day if the age range encountered is not very old.

Procedure For Otolith Examination

    1. Place the whole otolith in a petri dish that is lined with a black,
       felt background and enough water to completely submerge it.
    2. View the surface of the otolith under a dissecting microscope at
       about 10x magnification. Use a pencil with .5mm diameter lead to
       mark the first year's annulus.
    3. Place the whole otolith in clay which has been mounted on a chuck
       of the low speed saw, then cut in half.
    4. Using the forceps, take one of the otolith halves and hold it over
       the flame of an alcohol burner until it becomes carmel colored.
    5. This process allows the protein called otolin to react with the
       heat, and display the annuli.
    6. Place the "burnt" otolith half in petri dish of clay, and examine
       under microscope on 40x magnification.
    7. Count the number of annuli that can be seen, and write down the
       estimated age for the sample currently being examined.
    8. Enter all ages in a database for later use.
    9. Randomly select 20% of total sample and have a second biologist
       examine the otoliths indepently.
   10. Use a statistical program to compare ages assigned by the of first
       biologist with the ages assigned by second biologist. Ages are
       "tested" to within the same year.
   11. Record the percent agreement between the two biologists and compare
       with other tests on record involving the same species.
   12. Resolve all the differences or discrepancies between the biologists
       and release the ages to a senior level biologist who will use them
       in a stock assessment model.
