   City of Philadelphia Department of Human Services in collaboration with
   Philadelphia Citizens for Children & Youth and Philadelphia Safe and
   Sound Welcome. . . to the first Philadelphia Parenting Resource
   Directory! The Department of Human Services is excited to offer you
   information on how to find parenting education resources in your own
   neighborhood.While this listing is not reflective of all the parenting
   programs that are offered in Philadelphia, we think of this guide as a
   start and will be issuing new editions as we discover new programs that
   are helping Philadelphia parents do the best possible job for their
   children. Parents and caregivers from all walks of life can benefit
   from the kind of information, advice and support that the programs
   listed in this guide offer. This is especially true given the growing
   complexity of child-rearing in the 21st century. In this day and age,
   our children face too many challenges and risks. All of us can use some
   help in understanding our parenting roles better. The Department of
   Human Services has traditionally been seen as the last resort for
   families in trouble.We are proud of our work in helping children and
   families where abuse, neglect and delinquency have occurred. But we are
   just as proud of our growing efforts to positively impact on
   communities by supporting activities and programs that encourage good
   parenting and help Philadelphia 3 families provide a healthy,
   supportive environment for their children to grow and thrive. This
   guide is incomplete, and we need your help in making it more accurate
   and comprehensive. On page 39 there is a form which you can use to
   alert us to parenting education and support programs not currently
   listed in the guide, or to update or correct information that's listed
   here.We hope that this guide will become the major source of
   up-to-date, accurate information about where parenting education
   programs are located. You can also be added to our mailing list for
   future editions of this Directory by filling out the form on page 40
   and returning it to us. Another way to get information on parenting
   education is through DHS' own Parent Action Network, which can be
   reached by calling 215.PARENTS.We also plan to make this guide
   available on the Internet in the coming months. Parenting education
   programs are also available through the DHS network of Community Family
   Centers, which is listed on pages 27 to 30 of this guide. We hope that
   you find this guide a useful tool in finding parenting resources.
   Sincerely, Alba E. Martinez, Esquire Commissioner How to Use this
   Directory In this Directory, we have tried to make it as easy as
   possible for you to find the nearest parenting education resource to
   where you live or work. The major portion of programs included in the
   Directory is listed alphabetically, beginning on page 7. You can find
   particular programs in a specific Zip code by checking the Easy Locator
   on page 6. In this listing, look for your Zip code and go to the pages
   listed to find programs closest to you. We have also included other
   resources that might be helpful to you.These comprise a listing of
   Community Family Centers (page 27), each of which offers parenting
   education programs as well as after-school, youth development programs,
   and other social services.We have also listed contact infor- mation for
   child care programs (page 31), information on Head Start programs (page
   33), and support groups sponsored by the DHS Parent Action Network
   (page 24). For this edition, we have not captured all information on
   all programs, so there are gaps in some of these listings that we could
   not fill prior to publication. In our next edition, we hope to have
   more complete and accurate information. If you can help us to identify
   programs we have missed or to correct information that is listed here,
   please fill out the form on page 39. Acknowledgements 5 This first
   edition of DHS' Helping Hands:A Parenting Resource Directory is the
   result of a major collaboration among a number of people and
   organizations throughout Philadelphia who care about families.We owe an
   important debt to everyone who took the time to complete the survey of
   parenting education programs and to all who helped in pulling this
   information together so that we could come up with an
   easy-to-understand guide. In particular, we thank Shelly Yanoff, Bonnie
   Raines and Steven Fynes of Philadelphia Citizens for Children and Youth
   for their assistance in helping to bring the concept of the guide to
   reality. Naomi Post, Marsha Zibalese-Crawford, PhD, and Helen Hannigan
   of Philadelphia Safe and Sound came to the rescue on too many occasions
   to mention. Harriet Dichter and Linda Rich of the Philadelphia Division
   of Social Services provided leadership and hard work from the beginning
   of what turned out to be a much more complex and lengthy process than
   any of us envisioned. DHS would also like to thank the Annie E. Casey
   Foundation and Dr. Paul Fink for their support of this project.
   Finally, we also want to acknowledge the hard work of DHS staff in
   finally getting this publication in a form which can be useful to the
   community. In particular, we want to thank Liza Rodr√≠guez and consul-
   tant Marixa Rios of the Communications Department, and David Fair,
   Marcia Philpot,Tracy Davis, Theresa Hutson and Terkessa Bradsher of the
   Division of Community-Based Prevention Services. NOTE:The information
   in this Directory was collected through a survey mailed to over 3,000
   organiza- tions and individuals in the Delaware Valley. Not all
   listings are complete, and, while we have made every effort to check
   the accuracy of this information, there may be changes which have
   occurred prior to publication.A listing in this Directory does not
   constitute endorsement or sponsorship of any of these programs, nor is
   it a statement about the quality or performance of the services
   described herein. Easy Locator-Finding Help in Your Own Neighborhood To
