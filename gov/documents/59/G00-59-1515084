                         Cultural Resource Inventory


   The foundation of historic preservation planning is the identification
   of cultural resources, including, archaeological, historic and
   traditional cultural places. These can be buildings, structures, sites,
   districts, objects and landscapes. Together they comprise Washington's
   cultural heritage. Locating and documenting these resources is the
   first step in planning for their protection.

   One of OAHP’s fundamental responsibilities is identifying properties
   that represent Washington’s rich heritage. The process, known as
   "survey and inventory," involves documenting resources through field
   and archival research. The product of this process is a record for each
   property.

   To date, OAHP retains records of over 100,000 historic, archaeological
   and traditional cultural properties located across the state. This
   unique collection of records is the Washington State Inventory of
   Cultural Resources, used by researchers, project proponents, property
   owners, planners and others as an important planning and reference
   tool.

   OAHP is working to improve the efficiency and accessibility of this key
   historic preservation planning resource. To achieve this goal, one of
   OAHP’s priorities is to work on transforming the Inventory of Cultural
   Resources into an electronic database with instantaneous retrieval and
   transmittal capability.
