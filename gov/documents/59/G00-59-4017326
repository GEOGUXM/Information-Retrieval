   [table_images_icon.gif] Gene has been an oceanographer at NASA /
   Goddard Space Flight Center since 1985. He has been involved with the
   production, archival and distribution of the satellite-derived ocean
   color data sets, first as observed by the Nimbus-7 Coastal Zone Color
   Scanner and now, for the new ocean color mission called SeaWiFS which
   was successfully launched on August 1, 1997, for which he is
   responsible for the design, development and operations of the data
   processing system which also includes the SeaWiFS satellite receiving
   station. SeaWiFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field Sensor) is a unique mission in
   a number of aspects, not the least of which is the industry/government
   relationship that this project has adopted.

   [31oct83_galapagos_icon.jpg] [12april98_east_coast_true_icon.jpg] The
   applications of satellite-derived ocean color data range from providing
   the information needed for a more accurate assessment of the role of
   the ocean in global change, for providing a key parameter in a number
   of ecological and environmental studies, and the color images of the
   Earth's changing land and ocean features will be of significant use in
   fisheries management, agriculture assessment and coastal zone
   monitoring. There is no question that the Earth is changing. SeaWiFS
   enables us for the first time to monitor the biological consequences of
   that change - to see how the things we do, and how natural variability,
   affect the Earth's ability to support life.

   [sam2.gif] [paopao_reef_icon.jpg] Prior to 1985, Gene's experience
   included extended service (3 1/2 years) as a Peace Corps Volunteer in
   Western Samoa, where among other things he was involved in fish
   farming, sea turtle conservation, boat building and village fisheries
   development.

   [grayreef_small.gif] During his Peace Corps years, Gene experienced
   first-hand, many of the fisheries traditions unique to the south seas,
   including the rather remarkable way the people of the South Pacific
   fish for that most feared creature of the sea, the shark.

   [gene_fish_icon.jpg] [gene_deck_icon.gif] During the many years that
   Gene has spent going out to sea, he has come face to face with more
   than his fair share of marine life. After Peace Corps, he worked as a
   fisheries biologist in Seattle, Alaska and San Diego. It was through a
   combination of taking to heart the old sayings of "my boat is so small
   and the ocean so wide" and "you can't tell the forest for the trees",
   that Gene first became interested in the prospect of using satellite
   observations to help get a better understanding of how the oceans
   worked. This led to his becoming a Graduate Research Fellow at the
   Marine Sciences Research Center, State University of New York at Stony
   Brook, where for his dissertation, he used satellite and oceanographic
   data to study the variability in, and the relationship between, the
   physical and biological processes in the ocean.
   The author and co-author of numerous publications, Gene has also
   contributed to a large number of programs including The Jason Project,
   Public Broadcasting, the BBC, the Discovery Channel, the National
   Geographic Society, the Cousteau Society, the Smithsonian Institution,
   and U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment. In addition, he has
   been a member of the U.S. Scientific Steering Committee for the
   National Science Foundation's Joint Global Ocean Flux Study, a program
   to study the ocean's role in the global carbon cycle. He is currently
   on the International Science Advisory Council for the upcoming Coastal
   Rhythms Exhibition planned for the New England Aquarium, and is
   involved with the joint NOAA/NASA project studying the Health,
   Ecological, and Econonic Dimensions of Global Change (HEED).

   [j_icon.gif] Gene has been involved in using the World Wide Web (since
   January, 1994) and other emerging technologies to reach out to a wider
   audience. He is the creator of the JASON Project Home Page, which in
   collaboration with Dr. Robert Ballard, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic
   Institution, who led the team that found the wreck of the R.M.S.
   Titanic, and The JASON Foundation for Education, are using advanced
   interactive telecommuncations to educate and excite students about
   science and technology.

                         [xunantunich_panorama.jpg]

   [jungle_lab.gif] As part of his JASON experiences, Gene has had an
   opportunity to participate in a number of JASON expeditions including
   JASON IV to the Gulf of California, where the underwater mysteries of
   hydrothermal vents were explored. During JASON V Expedition to Belize,
   Gene ran fiber optic cables through the rain forest of Belize to
   establish JASON's Jungle Computer Lab that was used during the live
   expedition broadcasts. As part of the JASON VI: Island Earth
   Expedition, Gene helped develop the Spiders of the World interactive
   exercise that involved students in an online data gathering and sharing
   activity and coordinated the first JASON broadcast live via the
   Internet.

   [10apr_nr1_bridge3.thumbnail.jpg] [11apr_bb_jh_gene.thumbnail.jpg] In
   addition to his continued involvement with the online components of the
   1996 expedition, JASON VII: Adapting to a Changing Sea, which included
   the web-based Aquatic Field Study and Exploring the Steel Reef, Gene
   participated in an all day dive to the bottom of the sea on the Navy's
   nuclear research submarine, the

   [afqueen_whistle.gif] While at the JASON VII expedition site in Key
   Largo, Florida, Gene came face to face with one of the legends of the
   silver screen......the African Queen.

   [8apr_afq_flag.thumbnail.jpg] The Union Jack still flies proudly, high
   above the deck of the African Queen. The old steam boiler still needs
   to be kicked occasionally, lest it blow itself and all the inhabitants
   of the Queen into oblivion. However, it isn't Humphrey Bogart that is
   doing the kicking anymore, nor is it wood cut from the shores of a
   dark, leech-infested African river that keeps the old girl going.

   [8apr_afq_cpt_boil.thumbnail.jpg] [8apr_afqueen.thumbnail.jpg] Rather,
   it is James Hendricks and his bags of African Queen charcoal briquets
   that keep the legend alive. Most days, the African Queen rests
   peacefully on her cradle under a faded canopy at the dock beside the
   Key Largo Holiday Inn. However, the African Queen, that 30 foot
   collection of steel, wood, rope and character is not one to rest on her
   laurels. Under the watchful eye of Jim Hendricks she has plied the
   world's waterways from New Orleans to the English Channel and I was
   fortunate enough to be one of the lucky ones to follow in the footsteps
   of Bogart and Hepburn.
   [op_icon_100.gif] [ivory.icon.gif] Most recently, Gene has had a number
   of very productive collaborations with the Smithsonian Institution.
   Working with the Institution's Office of Environmental Awareness, he
   helped create the Smithsonian's first electronic exhibition, "Ocean
   Planet Online", which has been called one of the most comprehensive and
   technologically advanced exhibitions of its kind. In appreciation for
   this work, the Smithsonian Institution awarded Gene the James Smithson
   Bicentennial Medal.

   [squid_etching_small.gif] [clyde_hosing_mantle.small.jpg] Working with
   Dr. Clyde Roper and the folks at the Smithsonian's National Museum of
   Natural History, Gene helped to put In Search of Giant Squid online, an
   exhibition which explores and interprets the mystery, beauty and
   complexity of giant squids - the world's largest invertebrates and was
   based upon material presented in the Smithsonian's National Museum of
   Natural History's exhibit In Search of Giant Squid.

   In 1997, Clyde Roper lead a team of scientists to the depths of
   Kaikoura Canyon off the coast of New Zealand on An Expedition into the
   Depths of the Last Frontier.

   During February and March 1999, Clyde Roper returned to Kaikoura Canyon
   to continue the exploration of this incredible ecosystem. This time,
   Gene went along to help document the expedition as it took place.

   On a more recent trip to that part of the world, Gene learned first
   hand what the expression "going to the devil" really meant.

   Using tools developed for Ocean Planet, Norman Kuring and Gene worked
   with the Smithsonian's Office of Printing and Photographic Services to
   develop a Web-based utility to Search and Retrieve Images from The
   Smithsonian Photographic Services Data Base. Using this tool, it is
   possible to quickly and efficiently search through almost 1,000 image
   files covering topics ranging from Air and Space, to Science, Nature,
   Technology, History, and People-Places and to retrieve the images and
   captions.

   [BirthdayCake.icon.jpg] To help celebrate the Smithsonian Institution's
   150th Anniversary, Gene and Norman created a way for people around the
   world to wish the Smithsonian a happy birthday.

   [j9_icon_sm.gif] [tn_ocean_hole.jpg] For the JASON IX Expedition this
   year, Gene was onboard the research ship R/V Atlantis (April 17-26,
   1998) the newest research vessel from the Woods Hole's Oceanographic
   Institution where researchers used both the remotely operated vehicle
   (ROV) JASON and the manned submersible Alvin to explore the
   hydrothermal vent communities a mile beneath the Sea of Cortez.

   [tn_microtops1.jpg] In addition to helping provide daily updates of all
   the activities onboard the Atlantis live via satellite over the
   internet, Gene also collected daily measurements to help verify the
   atmospheric correction algorithms for SeaWiFS. Also, the Atlantis
   provided a great subject for photography.
   [P002657.icon.jpg] [tug_profile.thumbnail.jpg]
   [paddling_in_the_reeds.gif] As you can tell, water plays a major role
   in Gene's life....he enjoys the ocean, lakes, rivers, ponds.....just
   about anything that contains water except his basement.

   He spends as much time as possible paddling around in his kayak,
   exploring some of the many natural, and oftentimes, unnatural wonders
   that this area has to offer.
   Gene recently spent two weeks standing watches, chipping paint, tarring
   footropes, scraping and painting knees, pumping bilges, hauling lines,
   climbing ratlines, and in general, having an incredible experience, as
   he sailed onboard the wooden tallship "HMS" Rose from Miami to New York
   City.

   [house_spring_icon.gif] [audio_ic.gif] [audio_ic.gif] [guitars.gif]
   Gene earned his Ph.D. in Coastal Oceanography from the State University
   of New York at Stony Brook and lives in a 100 year old farmhouse along
   with his dog, Max,which gives him the opportunity to ride around on a
   little tractor, to dig in the dirt, and do death-defying feats with
   sharp tools.
