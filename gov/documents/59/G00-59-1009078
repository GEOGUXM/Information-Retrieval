     The vision for "Grids" is to revolutionize the use of computing in
     science by making the construction and use of large scale systems of
     diverse resources as easy as using today's desktop environments.

   Projects:
     * DOE Science Grid
       The DOE Science Grid's major objective is to provide the advanced
       distributed computing infrastructure based on Grid middleware and
       tools to enable the degree of scalability in scientific computing
       necessary for DOE to accomplish its missions in science.
     * pyGlobus
       An object-oriented python interface to the globus toolkit, with
       performance similar to using the underlying C code.
     * Grid Portal Development Kit
       The Grid Portal Development Kit provides both a portal development
       environment for the creation of new portals as well as a collection
       of Grid service beans used to accomplish basic operations such as
       job submission, file transfer and querying of information services.

   Collaborations:
     * Globus Project
     * Global Grid Forum

   Publications:
     * Publications (Papers and Talks)
