Dialup using Zmodem

   In order to use the camera server at a remote site using a modem,
   follow these steps:
    1. Enable your camera server for Zmodem support by setting the
       SERIAL_MODE parameter to FULL_SUPPORT. Use the Settings page
       (recommended), or FTP (see the Users Manual.)
    2. Make sure to have a modem software that has a scripting language
       and has support for the Zmodem file transfer protocol (Telix,
       ProComm or similar.)
    3. Connect a standard modem to the camera server's RS232 connector
       (28.8 kbit/s or higher is recommended.)
    4. Connect the modem to the phone line.
    5. Dial up the modem by ATDT<nnnnnn> where <nnnnnn> is the modem phone
       number.
    6. Log in to the camera server.
    7. Run the command sz fullsize.jpg to start the file transfer.
    8. Run logout terminate the session.

   The above procedure describes the manual operation  for automated
   operation, you need to write a script that performs steps 5-8.

   For more information on the modem function, please refer to the Users
   Manual.
