     What are dioxins? "Dioxins" refers to a group of chemical compounds
        that share certain similar chemical structures and biological
   characteristics. Several hundred of these toxic compounds exist and are
         members of three closely related families: the chlorinated
   dibenzo-p-dioxins (CDDs), chlorinated dibenzofurans (CDFs) and certain
     polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Sometimes the term dioxin is also
      used to refer to the most well-studied and one of the most toxic
   dioxins, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). CDDs and CDFs are
    not created intentionally, but are produced inadvertently by a number
       of human activities. CDDs and CDFs are also produced by natural
    processes. PCBs are man-made, but are no longer produced in the U.S.

     Dioxins are released into the air from combustion processes such as
   commercial or municipal waste incineration and from burning fuels (like
   wood, coal or oil). Dioxins can also be formed when household trash is
    burned and during forest fires. Chlorine bleaching of pulp and paper,
      certain types of chemical manufacturing and processing, and other
      industrial processes all can create small quantities of dioxins.
           Cigarette smoke also contains small amounts of dioxins.

       Over the past decade, EPA and industry have worked together to
     dramatically reduce dioxin emissions. Because dioxins are extremely
   persistent compounds, levels of dioxins still exist in the environment
   from both man-made and natural sources and will take years to decline.
   A large part of the current exposures to dioxins in the U.S. are due to
   man-made dioxins from releases that occurred in the past, even decades
    ago. Even if all human-generated dioxins could somehow be eliminated,
   low levels of naturally produced dioxins will remain. EPA is continuing
    to look for ways to reduce dioxin levels entering the environment and
                      to reduce human exposure to them.
