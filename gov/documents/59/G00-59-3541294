                     Floyd L. Thompson Technical Library
                                 At a Glance

     The Technical Library's main purpose is to support the aeronautics
      research activities that take place across the Center through the
        collection, classification, and dissemination of information.

     Our mission is to provide timely and useful information in the most
    relevant format (printed or electronic) to all engineers, scientists,
      managers, and support personnel by using the necessary resources.

   INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS

   Subject experts aid research efforts by developing search aides,
   conducting comprehensive research of specific topics using hundreds of
   databases and millions of records, including limited and classified.

   Reference librarians facilitate the information gathering efforts by
   identifying and locating resources needed by researchers as well as
   administer current awareness. Training classes in the use of library
   products to increase efficiency of Center staff are available upon
   request.

   Interlibrary loan specialists provide access to 800 million library
   items owned by a worldwide network of libraries and information centers
   as well as transact document retrieval from a host of information
   suppliers.

   Publication specialists manage the Center's scientific and technical
   information (STI) publications program and provide expert guidance to
   Center staff on publishing technical documents and then disseminate
   Langley STI documents and meeting presentations in full-text PDF or PS
   format on LTRS.

   DIGITAL ACCESS

   Connect to the wealth of digital information provided by the library
   from your office or from home*:

   Databases consisting of millions of records describe papers,
   conferences, books, journals, articles and other resources and provide
   subject coverage in aerospace sciences, structures and materials,
   atmospheric sciences, computer and information science, chemistry,
   engineering, management, nanotechnology. Many databases point to
   full-text sources when available.

   Electronic journals and conferences cover the recent literature across
   the scientific and technical disciplines. The electronic journals
   accessible at Langley number in the hundreds of titles and hundreds of
   thousands of articles.

   Digital documents of the NACA and recent Langley output provide the
   researcher the collective knowledge generated by this Center.
   Government agencies and other organizations continue to produce more
   electronically, and the library will continue to identify and provide
   access to relevant resources.
