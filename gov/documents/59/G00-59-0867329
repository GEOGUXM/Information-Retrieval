                    Rio Grande Colorado River Binational Waters

   [clearpixel.gif]

   The 1944 Water Treaty requires that the International Boundary Water
   Commission (IBWC) keep a record of the Rio Grande waters belonging to
   each country. The treaty provides that the IBWC shall construct,
   operate and maintain on the channel of the Rio Grande and its measured
   tributaries gaging stations for purposes of obtaining and determining
   such record. Implementation of the United States part of these
   activities is authorized by the American- Mexican Act of September 13,
   1950 as amended.

   The U.S. Section operates and maintains 14 gaging stations on the main
   channel of the Rio Grande. The U.S. Section operates and maintains
   twelve gaging stations on the measured tributaries in its country. In
   addition, the United States Section operates several gaging stations on
   United States diversion and return flow channels. The Mexican Section
   operates and maintains four gaging stations on the main channel of the
   Rio Grande and eight gaging stations located on measured tributaries in
   Mexico. The Mexican Section operates and maintains gaging stations
   located on diversion and return flow channels in Mexico. Each section
   of the IBWC gages the spring inflows from its side to the river
   downstream of the International Amistad Dam on the Rio Grande. Also,
   the United States Section operates 13 gaging stations for flood warning
   and operation of the flood regulation storage in the International
   Amistad and Falcon Reservoirs on the Rio Grande.

   The data forms the basis for joint accounting by the two sections of
   the waters belonging to each country. The national ownership of waters
   has been determined since 1953.

   The Water Accounting Division also oversees the operation of ten gaging
   stations on the Lower Colorado River in association with deliveries of
   water to Mexico pursuant to the 1944 Water Treaty. Flow records for
   these stations as well as others along the Western Boundary by both
   Sections of the Commission are published in annual Water Bulletins.

                                 PUBLICATIONS

   The collated stream gaging record and records of waters in storage, of
   rainfall and evaporation stations and of the measurements of the
   quality of waters are published annually in IBWC bulletins entitled
   "Flow of the Rio Grande and Tributaries and Related Data."

   A copy of this can be purchased at a cost of $11.45.
