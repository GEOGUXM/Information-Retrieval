                         Frequently Asked Questions

   What kind of information does the Local Area Unemployment Statistics
          (LAUS) program provide?
          The LAUS program provides monthly and annual average estimates
          for labor force, employment, unemployment, and the unemployment
          rate for some 6,700 areas. The areas include census regions and
          divisions, states, metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs),
          primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs), labor market
          areas (LMAs), counties and county equivalents, cities with a
          population of 25,000 and over, and cities and towns in New
          England. These data can be found on the LA series in LABSTAT.
          For a more detailed description of areas, see Geographic
          Concepts.

   For what time period are data available?
          Except for California, the West region, and the Pacific
          division, the monthly series start in 1978 for census regions
          and divisions, all states, the District of Columbia, Puerto
          Rico, and New York City. The estimates for California, the West
          region, the Pacific division, and the Los Angeles-Long Beach
          primary metropolitan statistical area begin in 1980; for all
          other substate areas (metropolitan areas, counties, county
          equivalents, and cities), they begin in 1990. (Note: Estimates
          of annual average state data starting as early as 1970 for some
          states and 1976 for all states are available on request to
          lausinfo@bls.gov.)

   How are the labor force components (i.e., civilian noninstitutional
          population, civilian labor force, employed, unemployed, and
          unemployment rate) defined?
          The official concepts and definitions used in the Current
          Population Survey (CPS) are followed. For a complete
          description, see Definitions of Labor Force Concepts.

          + Civilian noninstitutional population. Included are persons 16
            years of age and older residing in the 50 states and the
            District of Columbia, who are not inmates of institutions
            (e.g., penal and mental facilities, homes for the aged), and
            who are not on active duty in the Armed Forces.
          + Civilian labor force. Included are all persons in the civilian
            noninstitutional population classified as either employed or
            unemployed (see the definitions below).
          + Employed persons. Employed persons are all persons who, during
            the reference week (week including the twelfth day of the
            month), (a) did any work as paid employees, worked in their
            own business or profession or on their own farm, or worked 15
            hours or more as unpaid workers in an enterprise operated by a
            member of their family, or (b) were not working but who had
            jobs from which they were temporarily absent. Each employed
            person is counted only once, even if he or she holds more than
            one job.
          + Unemployed persons. All persons who had no employment during
            the reference week, were available for work, except for
            temporary illness, and had made specific efforts to find
            employment some time during the 4 week-period ending with the
            reference week. Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a
            job from which they had been laid off need not have been
            looking for work to be classified as unemployed.
          + Unemployment rate. The ratio of unemployed to the civilian
            labor force expressed as a percent (i.e., 100 times
            (unemployed/labor force)).

   What are metropolitan areas (MAs)?
          A MA is defined as a county or group of counties (cities and
          towns in New England) with (1) a city of 50,000 or more
          population or (2) a Census Bureau defined urbanized area of at
          least 50,000 population, provided that the component
          county/counties of the MA have a total population of at least
          100,000. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designates
          and defines MAs following a set of official standards. The MA
          classification is provided for use by Federal agencies in the
          production, analysis, and publication of data. Included among
          MAs are metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), consolidated
          metropolitan statistical areas (CMSAs), and primary metropolitan
          areas (PMSAs), based on 1990 census definitions. The LAUS (LA)
          series includes data for all of the 334 MSAs and PMSAs currently
          defined by OMB. For the official standards and definitions of
          individual MAs, see OMB Bulletin No. 96-08, "Revised Statistical
          Definitions for Metropolitan Areas (MAs) and Guidance on Uses of
          MA Definitions." For more information on MAs, see Metropolitan
          Areas.

   What are labor market areas (LMAs)?
          A general definition for a labor market area is an economically
          integrated area within which individuals can reside and find
          employment within a reasonable distance or can readily change
          jobs without changing their place of residence. LMAs include
          both metropolitan areas defined by the Office of Management and
          Budget and small labor market areas defined by the Bureau of
          Labor Statistics. LMAs are redesignated after each decennial
          census; currently there are about 2,400 LMAs, which exhaust the
          geographic area of the United States. For a detailed description
          of what constitutes an LMA and the criteria used for their
          designation, see Labor Market Areas. For individual LMA
          definitions, refer to Labor Market Areas, 1998, available from
          the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Division of Local Area
          Unemployment Statistics.

   What is the publication schedule for LAUS program news releases?
          The Regional and State Employment and Unemployment news release
          is generally issued about the third Friday of the month
          following the reference month. The Metropolitan Area Employment
          and Unemployment release is generally issued 12 days later (on
          the Wednesday before the first Friday of the following month).
          Data for all other areas are released one week after that. See
          Schedule of Data Release Dates for Coming Months.

   Why aren't data for all areas (the Nation, states, and substate areas)
          available at the same time?
          The timing of data availability is controlled by the length of
          time required to produce and validate estimates. Data for the
          nation, which come directly from the Current Population Survey,
          are available earliest; data for states and census regions and
          divisions are available next, between two and three weeks later;
          data for most metropolitan areas are available after about
          another week and a half; and data for the rest of the
          metropolitan areas, counties, cities, and towns are available
          last, a week after the first metropolitan areas. For the release
          dates for various type of data, see Schedule of Data Release
          Dates for Coming Months.

   Why are the labor force estimates for areas and cities different
          between the LA (Local Area) and GP (Geographic Profile) series?
          The data in the LA series are the official data used for Federal
          fund allocations and are based on a statistical methodology
          which uses data from a variety of sources. Data for
          approximately 6,700 geographic areas are developed in this
          manner and included in this database, including for all counties
          and cities of 25,000 or more, thus meeting the data needs of
          other Federal programs. The methodology is consistent across
          states, so areas can be compared to one another. Data are
          available on a monthly and annual basis, with preliminary
          estimates published within two months from the reference period.
          No demographic data are available from this series.
          The GP series provides data for only 50 large metropolitan areas
          (MAs) and 17 cities. These annual average data come directly
          from the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS sample is not
          large enough to provide reliable data for all areas (in fact,
          many areas contain no sample), nor is the reliability consistent
          among the areas published. These CPS estimates are the only
          current source of information on demographic and detailed
          economic characteristics for these areas.

   What is the difference between job losers and the unemployed?
          People who have lost a job make up a large portion of those
          classified as unemployed each month. There are also persons who
          have voluntarily left jobs, persons who have newly entered or
          re-entered the labor force but not yet found a job, and persons
          who have recently completed temporary jobs and are looking for
          employment. For a more detailed description of these labor force
          concepts and how these labor force classifications are defined,
          see Definitions of Labor Force Concepts.

   What is the Current Population Survey (CPS)?
          The CPS is a monthly sample survey of approximately 50,000
          households (nationally) conducted by the Bureau of the Census
          for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It is the source of much key
          labor market data, including the U.S. unemployment rate. For
          more information see Current Population Survey.

   What are "household" and "establishment" data, and how do they differ?
          "Household" data, as from the Current Population Survey (CPS),
          pertain to individuals and relate to where they reside.
          "Establishment" data, such as those from the Current Employment
          Statistics, a survey of businesses, pertain to jobs (persons on
          a payroll) and where those jobs are located. The data developed
          through the LAUS program are based on the household concept of
          the CPS. For information on these surveys and how they differ,
          see Household vs. Establishment Series.

   What are some of the Administrative Uses of LAUS data?
          Estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate are used by
          Federal agencies to allocate more than $20 billion in funds and
          to determine the eligibility of an area for benefits in various
          Federal programs. These include the Job Training Partnership Act
          (JTPA), the Wagner-Peyser Act, the Emergency Food and Shelter
          Program, Food Stamp limitation waivers, the Public Works
          Program, the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program
          (TEFAP), and Labor Surplus Area designation program. Under most
          programs, unemployment data are used to determine the
          distribution of funds to be allocated to each eligible area. In
          the case of the Food Stamp waivers and Labor Surplus Area
          designations, the data are used in the determination of area
          eligibility for benefits.

   What is seasonal adjustment?
          Seasonal adjustment is a statistical technique which eliminates
          the influences of weather, holidays, the opening and closing of
          schools, and other recurring seasonal events from economic time
          series. This permits easier observation and analysis of
          cyclical, trend, and other nonseasonal movements in the data. By
          eliminating seasonal fluctuations, the series becomes smoother
          and it is easier to compare data from month to month. In the
          LAUS program, data for census regions, census divisions, states,
          the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, New York City, and the
          Los Angeles-Long Beach area are seasonally adjusted. For a more
          complete description of seasonal adjustment and the methodology
          used to estimate seasonal adjustment factors, see Seasonal
          Adjustment.

   What methodology is used to produce the various estimates published by
          the LAUS program?
          There are a number of different methods used to produce the
          estimates published by the LAUS Program. The principal ones are:
          (1) a signal-plus-noise time series model for states, the
          District of Columbia, the Los Angeles-Long Beach PMSA, and New
          York City; (2) a building block approach referred to as the
          Handbook procedure for labor market areas; and (3)
          disaggregation procedures for many counties and virtually all
          cities. For a description of these procedures and their uses,
          see LAUS Estimation Methodology.

   Why are some of the detailed data available at the national level not
          also available at the state, metropolitan area, county, and city
          level?
          National data come from the Current Population Survey. The
          survey sample size is not large enough to provide all the data
          at a local, or even a state, level. National data are NOT the
          sum of local area estimates.

    What is the "Handbook" method?
          The Handbook method is a building-block approach using data from
          several sources--including the Current Population Survey, the
          Current Employment Statistics program, and unemployment
          insurance program--to produce labor force estimates at the
          substate level. Estimates for Labor Market Areas (LMAs),
          including both metropolitan and small LMAs, are produced using
          this methodology. For a description of the Handbook Method, see
          Estimates for Substate Labor Market Areas.

   What are "population controls"?
          The term "population controls" refers to population data
          developed from various independent sources, such as vital
          statistics on births, deaths, migration, school enrollment,
          persons living in group quarters, inmates in institutions, etc.,
          which are used in Current Population Survey estimation
          procedures to independently adjust sample-based labor force
          levels. These are updated annually by the Bureau of the Census
          and provided to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The impact on
          LAUS estimates of new population controls is to proportionately
          raise or lower the estimates of labor force levels (with
          unemployment rates, labor force participation rates, and
          employment/population ratios being unaffected) for states, the
          District of Columbia, Los Angeles-Long Beach, and New York City.
          Revisions are typically made to the three most recent years of
          data. For a description of methodology used to develop
          independent population estimates, see the publication, Bureau of
          the Census, Current Population Reports, Population Estimates and
          Projections, P-25-1106.

   What does the term "benchmarked" mean?
          The term "benchmarked" (in the LAUS program) refers to forcing
          the monthly statewide model-based estimates to population
          controlled Current Population Survey annual average estimates.
          Substate estimates are then revised and forced to add to the new
          state estimates. As part of the process, any changes in the
          inputs, such as revision in the Current Employment
          Statistics-based employment figures or unemployment insurance
          claims counts, and updated historical relationships, are
          incorporated.

   What does the term "model-based" mean, and what are "signal-plus-noise"
          models?
          The term "model-based" refers to the fact that estimates are
          derived by a statistical model rather than direct sampling. The
          approach used to estimate employment and unemployment in the
          states, the District of Columbia, the Los Angeles-Long Beach
          metropolitan area, and New York City is based on a
          signal-plus-noise model. This model postulates that the observed
          Current Population Survey estimate consists of a true, but
          unobserved, labor force value (the signal) plus noise that
          reflects the error arising from taking a probability sample
          rather than a complete census of the population. The modeling
          process separates the two to produce an estimate of the signal.
          For a more complete description, see Estimates for States.
