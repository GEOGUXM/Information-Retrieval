Zooming in on Black Holes

     The main science of Space VLBI focuses on the study of massive black
     holes. Radio galaxies and Quasars are thought to be the physical
     evidence of black holes.

     A black hole is something so massive that its escape velocity is
     greater than the speed of light, so no light can escape from it.
     While no one has ever "seen" a black hole, we know that the space
     around a black hole is not actually black. Material is pulled toward
     a black hole by its strong gravity field. This forms a swirling
     "accretion" disk around a black hole and enormous amounts of energy
     are released as the material slowly spirals into it. Some of the
     material is shot out in radiating jets along the axis of rotation of
     the disk. These jets radiate in radio bands which are visible to
     radio telescopes. Prior to the understanding of their source of
     energy, they were labeled Quasars (quasi-stellar radio sources).

     A key goal of Space VLBI is to use the long baselines between Earth
     and a spacecraft in orbit, and the precision of interferometry to
     allow us to create images as close as possible to the accretion disk
     around black holes, with as much detail as possible. Our resolution
     can be more than a thousand times better than even the best optical
     telescopes. So far, with the VSOP mission, we have been able to
     "see" deeper into the origins of these jets, and we are trying to
     look closer in, to see the accretion disks themselves.

     Further details may be found in the Project Science page.
