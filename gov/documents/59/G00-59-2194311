   This section focuses on saving energy in buildings. Two renewable
   energy sources that can save energy in buildings are discussed
   separately: solar energy and geothermal heat pumps.

   More basic information about building energy efficiency is also
   available.

   Technologies
   Building Envelope
   The building envelope includes everything that separates the interior
   of a building from the outdoor environment, including the windows,
   walls, foundation, basement slab, ceiling, roof, and insulation.

   Space Heating and Cooling
   Energy-efficient heating and cooling of buildings are aided through the
   use of automated controls, ventilation, improved duct systems, and
   advanced technologies.

   Water Heating
   Energy-efficient water heating combined with water-efficient appliances
   and fixtures will save water, energy, and money.

   Lighting
   Compact fluorescent light bulbs and other efficient lighting
   technologies save energy and money.

   Appliances
   Energy-efficient options are available for clothes washers and dryers,
   refrigerators, freezers, dishwashers, ovens, and stoves.

   Office Equipment and Building Electrical Equipment
   Most office equipment wastes energy as it sits idle; equipment with
   built-in power management features can greatly reduce energy use by
   switching to low-energy mode when not in use. Energy-efficient motors
   and transformers are also available.

   Issues
   Specific Types of Buildings
   Special programs exist to encourage energy efficiency in schools and
   federal buildings. Energy efficiency also helps those who live in
   affordable housing maintain affordable energy bills.

   Building Energy Codes
   Building energy codes are generally set on the state level. Model codes
   have been established at the national level, but these are usually
   modified to meet specific needs within each state.

   Efficiency Standards
   Energy efficiency standards for appliances are promulgated by the U.S.
   Department of Energy.

   Energy Audits
   A variety of tools and technologies are used to evaluate the energy
   efficiency of buildings.

   Financing
   Special financing is available that recognizes the savings due to
   energy efficiency, which allow the building owner to assume greater
   monthly mortgage payments. Some energy-efficient financing is based on
   the Home Energy Rating System (HERS).

   Whole-Building Design
   Whole-building design takes an integrative approach to building design
   so that all elements of the building help achieve an optimal energy
   performance. The building has to interact effectively with the outdoor
   environment Â— a concept known as climate-responsive architecture. A
   variety of design tools are available.

   Commissioning, Operation, and Maintenance
   Designing a building is only half the battle; it must be put into
   commission correctly, then operated and maintained correctly.
   Measurement and verification of building performance is an important
   aspect of commissioning new buildings.

   Landscaping for Energy Efficiency
   Landscaping can improve a building's energy performance. Trees and
   bushes can provide shading or block a prevailing wind, as can earth
   berms.

   Urban Heat Islands
   In urban areas, building energy efficiency is hampered by higher urban
   temperatures, an effect known as urban heat islands.
