   The pattern above below the ionospheric potential pattern for 20
   minutes ago. It is based upon the IMF measured by the ACE satellite 80
   minutes ago (60 minutes is the approximate time delay for the solar
   wind to propagate from the L1 point to the Earth), and a number of
   magnetometer measurements of the ionospheric current systems. The
   magnetometer station locations are shown on the potential plot.

   Using the assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics (AMIE)
   (Richmond et al., JGR, 1988) technique to determine a large number of
   electric potential patterns from ground based magnetometer stations,
   and estimates of the hemispheric power index, a multivariable linear
   regression analysis (e.g. Papitashvili et al., 1994) was preformed at
   each grid point to determine the relationship between the electric
   potential and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) Y and Z
   components.

   We have incorporated this statistically based model into the AMIE
   technique, allowing the statistical AMIE (SAMIE) to specify the
   background potential pattern, based upon measurements of the IMF.
