   [labmain.jpg] The Division at Narragansett, under the supervision of a
   Director reporting to the Associate National Director for Ecology, is
   responsible for marine, coastal, and estuarine water quality research.
   The mission of the Atlantic Ecology Division at Narragansett is to
   develop and evaluate theory, methods and data to better understand and
   quantify the environmental effects of anthropogenic stressors on the
   coastal waters and watershed of the Atlantic seaboard. Narragansett
   provides research support to EPA program offices and Regions in areas
   related to the protection of coastal marine ecosystems. Areas of
   research specialization at the AED include: understanding, quantifying,
   and modeling the cumulative effects of multiple anthropogenic stressors
   on coastal ecosystems; development of methods for assessing the
   ecological effects of contaminated marine sediments; development of
   species, population, and community-level indicators of ecological
   impacts resulting from anthropogenic activities; place-based integrated
   ecological assessments for the Atlantic Coast; and Information
   Management of regional scale environmental monitoring data.
