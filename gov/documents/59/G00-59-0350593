   MCDOT Bicycle Advisory Committee

   BAC In 1989, the Board of Supervisors approved the development of a
       Bicycle Program. The program hired a full-time Bicycle Coordinator, and
       created a bicycle advisory committee. The ten-member committee consists
       of two appointees from each of the five supervisor districts, chosen
       for their skill and interest in bicycling.
