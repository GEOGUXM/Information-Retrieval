   USGS
   Water Resources of Florida
   Message from the Florida District Chief

   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has been describing the water
   resources of Florida since the early 1900's. The Florida District of
   the U.S. Geological Survey's Water Resources Division consists of 256
   staff members at eight locations, all of whom contribute in some way to
   the studies underway. In conducting its mission of describing the water
   resources of the nation, the Geological Survey's Florida staff works
   with about 54 cooperating local, State, and other federal agencies with
   common interests in water resources.

   Scientists of the USGS are collaborating with resource-management
   agencies in all major hydrologic matters of concern in Florida. Program
   development among the USGS and State and local agencies is an evolving
   solution-oriented activity. Programs are reviewed regularly by
   participants, and future needs for data collection and hydrologic
   investigations are projected. Typically, USGS investigations are of the
   following major types: data collection, problem-oriented appraisals,
   and applied research. The historic and current data-collection programs
   in Florida consist of statewide monitoring networks for surface and
   ground waters. In addition to hydrologic surveillance, these sites
   furnish data for appraisal studies and research. Some networks are
   unique. For example, the USGS's streamflow program is the primary
   source of long-term discharge data in the State. Information from
   various USGS networks is combined for all the States to establish a
   national computerized data base.

   In 1999, the USGS managed about 65 hydrologic studies in Florida, most
   of which pertained to problem-oriented appraisals and applied research.
   These include, by broad category, the determination of the availability
   of regional water resources for growth-management planning,the
   assessment and mitigation of water-quality degradation, and current
   research programs on evapotranspiration, hydrodynamic and chemical
   modeling of surface- and ground-water flow, chemical solute transport,
   and wetland processes all of which are important to water-resources
   management.

   The Florida District staff welcomes any comments or suggestions that
   you, the users of our information, might have to help us in
   accomplishing our mission of describing Florida's water resources.
