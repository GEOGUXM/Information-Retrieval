   [clearspc.gif] Cantor Champions Trade Promotion
   Authority for President Bush

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 6â€” This afternoon, Congressman Eric Cantor
   (R-Virginia) voted with the bipartisan majority of the U.S. House
   of Representatives to provide Trade Promotion Authority (TPA)
   to President George W. Bush. Trade Promotion Authority cuts the
   red tape so that President Bush can negotiate trade agreements
   more efficiently. On Tuesday evening, Cantor hosted a special
   order speech in support of TPA on the Floor of the U.S. House at
   the request of the House leadership.
   "Right now, American families are experiencing a recession. The
   measure we passed today will provide greater access for
   American exports and will create more jobs for American families,"
   said Cantor. "The trade agreements of the past decade have
   provided the average American family of four with up to $2,000
   more income each year."
   In official remarks, Cantor said, "NAFTA allowed U.S. exports to
   Canada and Mexico to rise by $149 billion, leading to new sales
   that helped create nearly three million American jobs.
   Export-related jobs pay on average 13-16% more."
   "United States trade interests will continue to suffer if we do not
   grant the President Trade Promotion Authority," Cantor added.
   "Increased international trade and investments will create
   opportunities for American companies and American workers,
   lifting the world's standard of living and creating even more
   demand for American goods and services."
   Following today's passage of H.R. 3005, the Bipartisan Trade
   Promotion Authority Act, the measure must now be sent to the
   U.S. Senate for its consideration.
