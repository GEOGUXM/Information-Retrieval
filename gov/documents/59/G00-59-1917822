                          AppleTalk Phase Out at Fermilab

   Phase I

      On October 4, 2001, AppleTalk Routing was contained within the
      individual workgroups throughout the lab. Although AppleTalk is
      present, AppleTalk Zones will not be routed outside a workgroup.
      AppleTalk users can only see their own AppleTalk Zone.

   Phase II

      On December 31st, 2001, AppleTalk will no longer be supported at the
      laboratory. All AppleTalk Routing will be removed from all router
      interfaces across the lab. Users will no longer be able to see any
      AppleTalk Zone.
      As AppleTalk users migrate to other supported platforms, they will
      still only be able to see Apple Shares and Printers; however, these
      Shares and Printers will not be seen from other workgroups beside their
   own.
