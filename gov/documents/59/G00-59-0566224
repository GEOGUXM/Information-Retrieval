FIRST RESULTS 2001 LEONIDS

   The 2001 meteor storms were a spectacle and surpassed most people's
   expectations. The storms occurred much as predicted, with two strong
   storms visible from north America (1767 dust trail) and from the
   western Pacific and Australia (1699 and 1866 dust trails).
