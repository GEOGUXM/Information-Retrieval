   Privacy and Security Notice

   Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS) operates this World
   Wide Web site as a public service through the National Ocean Services
   (NOS). Both the OCNMS and the NOS are administered by the National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Department of
   Commerce.

   Information presented on these pages is considered public information
   and may be distributed or copied. Use of appropriate photo and image
   credits is requested.

   NOS collects statistics on usage trends, locations of entry, and any
   failed functions of the site. These aggregate statistical summaries are
   posted on the web site for use by National Ocean Service personnel, and
   are available to the public.

   Electronic mail sent to addresses listed on this Web site is treated no
   differently than any other electronic mail. All electronic mail
   transactions are handled by electronic mail servers, and do not pass
   through this Web site, nor are they monitored or recorded in any way.

   This Web site does not use Web "cookies."

   For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
   available to all users, this government computer system employs
   hardware and software to monitor network traffic and to identify
   unauthorized attempts to add or alter information, or otherwise cause
   damage or interfere with information delivery. Except for authorized
   law enforcement investigations, no attempt is made to identify
   individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs may be stored
   indefinitely for use in statistical analysis or to protect the security
   and integrity of the computer system.

   Unauthorized attempts to add information or alter information on this
   service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the
   Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information
   Infrastructure Protection Act.

   Please note that other National Ocean Service Web sites may have
   different information collection practices. If interested, please
   consult their site-specific privacy statements for details on such
   policies.

   If you have nay questions or comments about the information presented
   here, please forward them to nosweb@noaa.gov

    Examples of information collected by this Web site

   Web servers keep a record of their activity in a log file. Every time a
   visiting computer requests a file from the Web server, a log entry is
   recorded. A typical log file entry for the National Ocean Service Web
   site looks like this:

   10/04/00 13:19:18 OK somemachine.somenetwork.com Mozilla/4.75(
   Macintosh; U; PPC) http://othermachine.othernetwork.come/neatsites.html
   "www.ocnms.nos.noaa.gov" : welcome.html 15208

   What this entry means:
     * 10/04/00 13:19:18-- Date and time of the request (24-hour clock).
     * OK 200 -- Status code of the request. "OK" and a status code of
       "200" are equivalent; they mean the requested file was successfully
       found and delivered to the requesting (visitor's) computer.
     * somemachine.somenetwork.com -- Internet address (or IP address, in
       the form of 123.123.123.123) of the requesting computer. Depending
       on how the requesting computer is connected to the Internet, this
       may not identify a specific computer.
     * Mozilla/ 4.75 (Macintosh; U; PPC) -- Type of browser used by the
       requesting computer.
     * http://othermachine.othernetwork.com/neatsite.html -- The Internet
       address if the last site visited by the requesting computer, useful
       in discovering how visitors found this Web site.
     * "www.ocnms.nos.noaa.gov" -- The Internet address of this Web site.
       As several Web sites are served on a single computer, the Web
       server uses this information to determine which Web site should
       handle the request.
     * ;welcome.html -- The name of the file requested by the visiting
       computer.

   15208 -- Size of the requested file, in bytes.
