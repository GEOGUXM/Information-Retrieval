        Board of Vocational Nursing And Psychiatric Technicians Logo

                             GENERAL INFORMATION

   Established in 1951 (Vocational Nurse Program) and 1959 (Psychiatric
   Technician Program); the Board is responsible for administering the
   laws related to the practice of licensed vocational nurses and
   psychiatric technicians. In 1970, the Psychiatric Technician
   certification was changed to a licensure program based upon passage of
   Senate Bill 298.

   Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs) provide basic bedside nursing care to
   clients under the direction of a physician or registered nurse. The LVN
   utilizes scientific and technical expertise and manual skills. Duties
   within the scope of practice of an LVN typically include, but are not
   limited to, provision of basic hygienic and nursing care; measurement
   of vital signs; basic client assessment; documentation; performance of
   prescribed medical treatments; administration of prescribed
   medications; and, performance of non-medicated intraveneous therapy and
   blood withdrawal (requires separate Board certification.)

   Psychiatric Technicians (PTs) provide care for mentally disordered or
   developmentally disabled clients under the director of the services.
   The director may be a physician, psychologist, rehabilitation
   therapist, social worker registered nurse or other professional
   personnel. The PT utilizes scientific and technical expertise and
   manual skills to provide care and training for clients with mental
   disorders and developmental disabilities. Duties within the scope of
   practice of a PT typically include, but are not limited to, basic
   hygiene and nursing care; measurement of vital signs; performance of
   prescribed medical treatments; administration of prescribed
   medications; implementation of behavioral management techniques; crisis
   intervention; sensory and perceptual development assessment; social and
   vocational training; and, the facilitation of individual and group
   therapeutic activities.
