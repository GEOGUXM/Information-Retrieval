   John at Angel Food Ministries Hello, I'm John Linder, and I would like
   to welcome you to the electronic home of the
   11th Congressional District of Georgia.  It is truly a great honor to
   serve the citizens of the 11th District, and I believe that
   communication between citizens and elected officials is vital to
   effective governance.  It is amazing how much the Internet has helped
   to strengthen my line of communication with my constituents, and I hope
   that linder.house.gov becomes a regular stop on your forays through
   cyber-space.

   My website can be a useful tool in locating information about the
   issues currently facing Congress and the services I can provide to you
   as your Representative.

   I plan to continually add new and exciting features to this page, so
   come back often.  But before you go, please sign my guest book and
   register to receive the Linder News Letter.  Again, thank you for
   stopping by, and feel free to contact me anytime I may be of
   assistance.

   Sincerely,
