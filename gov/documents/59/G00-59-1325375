     FDA APPROVES EXPANDED USE OF BRAIN IMPLANT FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE

   FDA today approved an expanded use of a brain implant to help control
   some symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease.

   The device, a deep brain stimulator, made by Medtronic, Inc., of
   Minneapolis, Minn., was initially approved by FDA in 1997 for use in
   one side of the brain to help control tremors on one side of the body.

   Today, after review of additional studies conducted by the
   manufacturer, the agency approved the device, called the Activa
   Parkinson's Control System, for use in both sides of the brain to help
   reduce some of the other symptoms of advanced Parkinson's that cannot
   be adequately controlled with medication.

   An estimated 1.5 million Americans have Parkinson's disease, which
   results in tremors, rigidity, postural instability, slowness and
   difficulty moving and, in some people, intellectual deterioration.

   The Activa system consists of electrodes that are implanted into the
   brain and connected by leads (wires) under the skin to a pulse
   generator implanted in the abdomen or chest. The pulse generator sends
   a constant stream of tiny electrical pulses to the brain, blocking
   tremors. When the device is implanted in both sides of the brain, two
   separate systems are used.

   To turn the stimulator on and off, the patient holds a magnet over the
   pulse generator. The generator must be replaced every three to five
   years, the life of the battery.

   FDA based approval of the device on a clinical study conducted by
   Medtronic of the system's safety and effectiveness when implanted in
   both sides of the brain and on the recommendation of the Neurological
   Devices Panel of FDA's Medical Devices Advisory Committee.

   Some 160 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled at 18
   medical centers in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. The
   device was implanted bilaterally in 134 patients. The implant
   procedures were done simultaneously or in stages. The patients were
   followed for approximately one year.

   During the study, patients were evaluated for a variety of Parkinson's
   symptoms using a test for total motor skills, including hand movement,
   leg agility, facial expression, rigidity, tremor and speech. They were
   tested with the Activa system turned on, both with and without
   medication. Total motor skills improved in nearly half the patients
   taking medication and approximately 90 percent of the patients not
   taking medication.

   In addition, diary data from a subset of 64 patients in the study
   showed that the Activa device increased good motor function and relief
   from Parkinson's symptoms by an average of six hours a day. And it
   decreased by an average of three hours a day the amount of time the
   patients experienced abnormal, involuntary movements such as a waving
   of arms.

   Although some patients in the study benefited significantly from the
   Activa system, the study also showed that individual results varied
   considerably and specific benefit for an individual cannot be
   predicted.

   Nearly all of the 160 patients enrolled in the study experienced one or
   more adverse events. During the entire study, 7.5 percent had bleeding
   into the brain; 11 percent had device-related infection; 10 percent had
   weakness (paresis/asthenia), and 8 percent had paralysis or weakness on
   one side of the body (hemiplegia/hemiparesis).

   Some 37 percent of the adverse events, such as breakage of the lead,
   pain and infection, were related to the Activa system. Six percent of
   the device-related adverse events were serious and ongoing, including a
   worsening of motor impairment and other Parkinson's symptoms.

   Medtronic has agreed to conduct a three-year, post- approval study of
   the system to assess its long-term clinical results.
