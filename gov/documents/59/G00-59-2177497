     FrogWeb: Resources for Kids

     A message from the Kratt brothers
     Kratts' Creatures

   Kratt Brothers There are many ways to involve kids in the discussion,
   debate, and investigation of amphibian declines and deformities
   phenomena.  Whether it's learning about frog anatomy, finding out about
   their local amphibians, building a frog pond, or learning about the
   cultural importance of frogs, kids - and the folks who care about them
   - can find lots of interesting and educational amphibian activities
   through FrogWeb!
