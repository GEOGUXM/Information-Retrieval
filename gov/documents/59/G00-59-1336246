   Irrigation Team

   [lonoke.jpg]

        The Irrigation Team is currently working on two irrigation
   projects along the White River (Grand Prairie) and Arkansas River
   (Bayou Meto) addressing the decrease in the Mississippi River alluvial
   aquifer.
       The purpose of the projects is to protect the groundwater resources
   and provide a sustained agricultural water supply while enhancing fish
   and wildlife habitat.
