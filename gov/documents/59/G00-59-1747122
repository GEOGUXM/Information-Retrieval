  [world.gif] The El Niño - Southern Oscillation (ENSO)

   [bluebar.gif]

   Global weather patterns are linked to El Niño, an anomalous (but
   natural) warming of surface water in the equatorial Pacific that
   influences agriculture, the fishing industry, and other life-sustaining
   activities on Earth. El Niño occurs at irregular intervals in
   association with the Southern Oscillation, a massive variation of
   atmospheric pressure between the southeastern and the western tropical
   Pacific.

   The Aeronomy Laboratory's network of tropical Pacific wind profilers is
   examining the response of the atmosphere to El Niño ocean warming, so
   that insight can be gained into the changes in U.S. weather that are
   strongly influenced by the El Niño. This will contribute to the
   scientific basis for a more "global" weather forecast, so that societal
   impacts of the major multi-year weather variations can be better
   anticipated.

   The Trans-Pacific Profiler Network. CLICK HERE for TPPN: Observations
   to Improve the Analysis and Prediction of El Niño, Global Weather, and
   Climate The Tropical Dynamics and Climate Program of the Aeronomy
   Laboratory operates a network of wind-measuring instruments at tropical
   island sites that span the Pacific Ocean basin. Developed in
   collaboration with the Environmental Technology Laboratory (also of
   NOAA), the instruments are highly sophisticated and do much more than
   measure the wind at the surface-- they measure a "profile" of both
   vertical and horizontal winds at heights from the surface to about 5 -
   15 kilometers, depending upon the frequency of the instrument. Briefly,
   wind profilers are Doppler radars that observe winds from the Doppler
   shifts of "clear air" atmospheric echoes. In addition to wind
   measurements, the instruments give insights into atmospheric turbulence
   and stability and are used to study precipitating convective systems.
   TPPN profilers include 50 MHz profilers that measure winds to a height
   of 15 kilometers and 915 MHz profilers that measure winds to a height
   of 5 kilometers. The combined data set yields important information
   about large-scale atmospheric circulation associated with the El
   Niño-Southern Oscillation (a natural climate phenomenon that affects
   weather and impacts human activities around the globe). A technical
   description of TPPN profilers is available.

   The TPPN has been put to work in several international field programs
   to study the atmosphere of the tropical Pacific. Among them are the
   Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere (TOGA) program to study the evolution
   of El Niño and its relationship to the Southern Oscillation; the Global
   Ocean Atmosphere Land System (GOALS) program designed to improve
   numerical modeling and prediction of the ocean-atmosphere-land surface
   system on a regional to global scale; the Global Energy and Water Cycle
   Experiment (GEWEX) designed to improve the understanding of the
   hydrological cycle; and the Pan American Climate Study (PACS) designed
   to provide a better understanding of regional climate in the Americas
   and its dependence on equatorial air-sea interactions over the eastern
   Pacific.

   Most recent pacific profiler wind observations are available for
   viewing. During cruises, near real-time profiler wind observations from
   the R/V Ka'imimoana may also be viewed. The Ka'imimoana services the
   TOGA TAO array of moored atlas buoys maintained by the Pacific Marine
   Environmental Laboratory (PMEL).

   Profiler wind observations from the above listed sites are maintained
   by the NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory to support tropical dynamics and
   climate research. The data presented are obtained via satellite from
   remote Pacific Island sites. Data flow on these links is occasionally
   interrupted, but more detailed data are recorded on site and are
   available to the climate research community from the NOAA Aeronomy
   Laboratory.

   A brief description of how TPPN data are disseminated is available, as
   is a listing of published research using tropical profilers affiliated
   with the NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory's Tropical Dynamics & Climate Group.
