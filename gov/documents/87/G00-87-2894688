                      Information about the STC program

   WHAT IS AN STC?
   A supplemental type certificate (STC) is a certificate issued when an
   applicant has received FAA approval to modify an aircraft from its
   original design.  The STC, which incorporates by reference the related
   type certificate, approves not only the modification but how that
   modification affects the original design.

   YOU'VE FOUND ONE YOU WANT TO INSTALL ON YOUR AIRCRAFT. WHAT DO YOU DO
   NOW?
   You must contact the STC holder to seek written permission.  The STC
   and its related information-- all drawings, data, specifications--are
   the property of the STC holder.   The FAA will not release this
   information without authorization from the owner.

   YOU TRIED. COULDN'T FIND THE STC HOLDER.
   If the mail you sent was returned "undeliverable" and there is no phone
   listing for the holder, please contact the issuing FAA office.   STCs
   are approved and issued through FAA aircraft certification offices
   (ACOs) which serve the geographic area of the STC owner's residence.

   YOU'RE INTERESTED IN GETTING YOUR OWN STC.
   For information regarding the STC application process, you may contact
   the ACO in your geographic area.  You may also find it helpful to
   review related orders and advisory circulars, in particular, Order
   8110.4B, "Type Certification Process," and AC 21-40, "Application Guide
   for Obtaining a Supplemental Type Certificate".

   HOW DO YOU FIND WHAT STCs HAVE BEEN FILED THROUGH 337's IN YOUR
   AIRCRAFT FILE?
   All 337's are mailed to FAA's Aircraft Registration's branch and filed
   in individual folders by registration number.  You may visit FAA
   aircraft registry's website at http://registry.faa.gov or contact them
   at:
