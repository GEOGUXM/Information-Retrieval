   The director of the National Ocean Service is Margaret A. Davidson,
   Acting Assistant Administrator for Ocean Services and Coastal Zone
   Management. The Deputy Assistant Administrator is Jamie Hawkins.

   Budget information from 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 is available.

   The National Ocean Service Headquarters is located in Silver Spring,
   Maryland, U.S.A., just north of Washington, D.C. For a map and

   nos_mural.jpg (11844 bytes) The National Ocean Service, a part of the
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) approaches the
   21st century with a clear vision--that our coasts and oceans enjoy
   robust health, provide a rich bounty of resources and are wisely
   managed to endure competing uses. As the nation's principal advocate
   for coastal and ocean stewardship, the National Ocean Service develops
   the national foundation for coastal and ocean science, management,
   response, restoration, and navigation. The National Ocean Service
   maintains its leadership role in coastal stewardship by bridging the
   gap between science, management, and public policy in the following
   areas:

   Healthy Coasts

   The North American coastline offers immeasurable wealth and an
   abundance of natural resources. However, ocean and freshwater coastal
   areas are constantly changing because of natural and human forces. Our
   coastal areas are magnets for a wide array of commercial, recreational,
   residential, industrial, and transportation uses. An increasing
   population and a vigorous economy bring with them greater pressures,
   such as pollution and physical alteration of our coasts and surrounding
   areas. These pressures can harm or destroy valuable and sometimes
   irreplaceable resources. The National Ocean Service, through research,
   response to coastal threats, restoration of damaged areas, and
   management of coastal resources works to achieve balance in the coastal
   zone for this and future generations.

   Navigation

   Navigating ships and boats safely in and out of ports and along our
   coasts is more difficult than most people realize. In many of our
   busiest ports, unknown rocks, wrecks, and obstructions silently wait
   below the surface to be discovered by unfortunate mariners. The
   National Ocean Service provides a wide-range of navigational products
   and up-to-the-minute data that help vessels safely move through U.S.
   waters. The need for these products is great, and continues to increase
   as waterways become more congested and ships get larger.

   The key to navigation is knowing where you are, or "accurate
   positioning."  The National Ocean Service provides the nation with the
   basic set of information needed for accurate positioning. This includes
   nautical charts, coastal surveys, and the National Spatial Reference
   System, a set of standard reference points that establish the latitude,
   longitude, and elevation framework for the nation's land surveying,
   navigation, positioning, and mapping activities.

   Coastal and Ocean Science

   Our oceans and coasts are places of mystery and wonder. They affect our
   weather, commerce, jobs, recreation, and where we build homes and
   locate businesses. They are an important source of food and energy. The
   coast is home to more than half of the U.S. population. But living in
   harmony with the coastal-ocean environment means we must continually
   strive to solve the mysteries and learn the secrets of the sea. The
   National Ocean Service is a leader in ocean and Great Lakes coastal
   science. Federal agencies, state and county governments, scientists,
   and others involved in coastal and ocean-related work depend on
   National Ocean Service scientific data, technical assistance, and
   coordination. Some of the National Ocean Service's science activities
   include understanding and predicting impacts on sensitive habitats,
   studies of natural disasters, how climate change may affect our lives,
   and the investigation of the causes of harmful algal blooms and
   microbes, such as red tides and toxic Pfiesteria piscicida.

   Coastal Hazards

   Conditions such as a hurricane and the powerful storm surges it brings,
   a tsunami set into motion by an undersea earthquake, and beach erosion
   caused by the relentless pounding of the surf can be either natural
   events or natural disasters. The difference is whether or not people
   and buildings are in the way. And when natural hazards occur in coastal
   cities with busy ports, they have a ripple effect across the country.
   After severe storms, communities and individuals are faced with
   tremendous costs associated with not only the clean up of homes,
   businesses, and property, but also with lost jobs, medical expenses,
   and the likelihood of higher fees for property insurance. Although the
   forces of nature cannot be controlled, the National Ocean Service
   provides communities with information about coastal hazards so they can
   better reduce or eliminate the destructive effects of natural events.

   The National Ocean Service has set its course for the future -- as the
   nation's coastal steward and provider of navigation information, the
   National Ocean Service must keep pace with increasing demands for
   accurate, usable data about the world in which we live.

   The five year NOS Strategic Plan 1999 - 2004 (PDF format, 1,535 kb)
   provides a very detailed description of the goals and objectives of the
   National Ocean Service.

   The Addendum to the NOS Strategic Plan, 1999-2004: NOS Office Strategic
   Plans (PDF format, 175 kb), outlines the Office-level Strategic Plans
   for 10 NOS offices. An introductory page summarizes each office's
   principal activities and provides a chart of its internal divisions.
   The office's strategic vision, mission, goals and objectives follow the
   introduction.

   The NOS Program Office Organization Chart depicts the latest NOS
   organizational scheme and its internal divisions.
