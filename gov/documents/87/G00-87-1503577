     EDUCATION PROGRAMS

      Math and Science Academy enters second year of operation.

      [awards_night.jpg] In the three subsequent weeks, teachers new to the
      program as well as three student teachers who will be part of the
      program this year participated in training to try to catch them up to
      the initial group. They were joined by the returning teachers for part
      of the time, and a lot of time was devoted to team building as well as
      the other focus areas. Teachers explored more ideas in standards-based
      education; assessments; including portfolios; instructional strategies,
      including cooperative learning; and they worked on honing their skills
      in technology. They explored the Marco Polo website and practiced using
      software such as Teacher Tools, Inspiration, Microsoft Office, and
      Timeliner.
      During the fall semester, the two master teachers, Cathy Berryhill and
      Carol Brown have spent time in the classrooms implementing the
      Cognitive Coaching protocol, which includes a pre-conference, an
      observation and a post-conference. They have made extended 3-day visits
      to the outlying districts, Chama and Mora, as well as an extra day trip
      each month to each site. There are 14 teachers involved in the program
      in Española between the seventh grade and eighth grade campuses, and it
      has been a real challenge to implement the program and meet each
      teacher's need.
      Some of the requirements for MSA teachers this year is to spend 30
      minutes on-line per week, checking email, and responding to posts on a
      community website. They also meet after school for 90 minutes, either
      as a team, or in content areas. They are building a growth/progress
      portfolio focused on some aspect of the MSA program. The portfolio
      includes an entry per month of a lesson plan with all the planning
      stages, copies of student work (top, middle, and low), and their
      reflections on the process and product that was generated.
      We have had a first visit from the program evaluators from UCLA/CRESST
      for this year. Ellen Osmundson spent four full days visiting teachers
      in and out of their classrooms at all four sites. She was not able to
      visit all the teachers in the program even with a very tight schedule.
      She is planning on spending five days on her next visit.
      On December 1, 2001, all the teachers gathered for a mid-year time of
      sharing and reflecting. Each team of teachers presented to the rest of
      the group a PowerPoint presentation highlighting the progress the
      teachers were making in various areas. The teachers also brought their
      portfolios to share with one another. A potluck and gift exchange
      rounded out the day to help strengthen the bonds of professional and
      personal ties that these teachers have formed as they have participated
      in the MSA program.
      The second year of the Math and Science Academy (MSA) started in July,
      2001 with a 3-day Leadership Institute for the administrators of the
      participating districts. Principals, and other administrators got a
      taste of some of the training in which their teachers participated
      during the pilot/developmental year. In order to effect systemic
      reform, it is critical for the administrators not only to understand
      the goals of MSA (one of which is to increase student achievement by
      improving teacher quality), but to adopt and support them. Teachers
      cannot implement reforms without support from administration.
      The Math and Science Academy is a collaborative effort between Los
      Alamos National Laboratory and the Northern New Mexico Council for
      Excellence in Education.

     LEARNING

   The future strength of the nation, depends on a well-educated workforce
   and a science-literate public. For that reason, Los Alamos is dedicated
   to supporting our schools.
