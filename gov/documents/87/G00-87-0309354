          The USGS Library database includes over 225,000 records for
          books, journals, maps, microforms, videocassettes, CD-ROMS, and
          pamphlets. Online citations describe items that have been added
          to the library since 1975 plus all of the publications of the
          USGS. The catalog identifies how many copies of each title are
          in the collection, where the copies are located, and whether
          they are currently charged out or available.

          The Minerals Information Collection contains materials that were
          transferred to the USGS Library from the former headquarters
          library of the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1996. There are
          approximately 18,500 items in the collection, and the subject
          focus is on mining technology, mine safety and health, and the
          mineral industry.
