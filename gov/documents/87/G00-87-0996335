                               [GetTech title]

   What is GetTech?

   GetTech is a public-private partnership designed by the Department of
   Commerces Office of Technology Policy and the National Association of
   Manufacturers to inspire teens to prepare for the technology-driven
   jobs of the future.

   The American job market and our workplaces are being transformed by
   rapid advances in science and technology. As a result, in nearly every
   field, the demand for technological expertise is growing, and skilled
   jobs involving science and technology are some of the best paying jobs
   our economy offers. Yet, many students opt out of the math and science
   courses that will prepare them for these careers because of negative
   stereotypes and a lack of role models and career information.

   The GetTech campaign intends to reverse negative perceptions and
   showcase the many exciting and rewarding careers open to those who
   develop their math, science and technology skills.

   Who is the Audience?

   GetTech is aimed at young people, particularly those in middle school,
   when they are beginning to think about careers. Parents, teachers, and
   guidance counselors, are part of GetTechs audience, as they play a key
   role in shaping students career choices. GetTech includes companies
   too, since this campaign is a direct response to industrys demand for
   more skilled workers. Companies can get involved in their local schools
   by providing demonstrations, role models and mentors for students.

   How Will GetTech Reach Kids?

     * Kid-Friendly Website
       At the www.gettech.org website, young people will be able to
       explore future career paths. This website describes careers in the
       fields of new manufacturing, information technology, engineering
       and industrial technology, biotechnology and chemistry, health and
       medicine, and arts and design. It answers questions like: How many
       new jobs? How much do they pay? What would I do on a typical day?
       What are the hours? What kind of education and training do I need?
     * Toll-free Hotline
       At 1-866-468-TECH, parents, teachers, mentors and kids can get
       information kits, posters, and specialty items that will carry the
       message to Americas future work force, making it easy to get tech
       even without Internet access.
     * Public Service Announcements
       Television, movie, and radio PSAs, produced by the prestigious
       Hollywood-based Women in Film, urge student to get tech and take
       advantage of the cool career opportunities open to those skilled in
       math and science. Bilingual radio spots also carry the message to
       children and adults.
