   Welcome to Arizona HEAT

   [AZHEAT.gif] Welcome to ArizonaÂ’s Statewide Eligible Training Provider
   website. As required by the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998,
   this website has been developed through a collaborative effort of the
   Arizona Department of Education, School to Work Division, Workforce
   Development Unit and the Arizona Department of Economic Security,
   Workforce Development Job Training Administration.

   The purpose of the Workforce Investment Act:
   Increase the employment, retention and earnings of participants, and,
   as a result, improve the quality of the workforce, reduce welfare
   dependency and enhance the productivity and competitiveness of the
   Nation.

   Workforce investment activities authorized and funded by WIA are
   delivered at the local level to those in need of services, including
   job seekers, dislocated workers, displaced homemakers, youth, veterans,
   disabled individuals and employers. Services are provided through a
   One-Stop delivery system which incorporates partnerships between
   various public and private sector employment and training agencies.

   Career Center:
   Through any of the One-Stop Career Centers across Arizona, Core
   Self-Services will be universally accessible to anyone. Whether an
   individual is already part of the workforce or new to the workforce,
   the One-Stop Centers provide a full range of services. These include:
   information, employment, training and education services for all job
   seekers. Staff-Assisted Core, Intensive and Training Services are
   available to those persons eligible to receive WIA Title I services.

   Training Demand:
   Individuals who seek training to obtain employment or upgrade their
   marketable skills are given access to information about all training
   providers and training programs that have been given approval by one or
   more of the Local Workforce Investment Boards (LWIBs) throughout the
   state.

   ETPL:
   The Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL) has been developed so
   identified eligible individuals may be involved in WIA-funded training
   activities. Use of the ETPL will provide an opportunity for acquisition
   of necessary tools to allow eligible individuals, as well as the
   general public, to make informed choices about training preferences
   that will drive their future career decisions. Key to the delivery of
   training services is the Consumer Report Card, an annual compilation of
   performance data that presents the viewer with specific information
   about the success of each training program.

   Eligible Providers:
   The types of training providers eligible for this list include, but are
   not exclusive to, Postsecondary Educational Institutions, Vocational
   Education Institutions, and Community-based Organizations who provide
   occupational training and Apprenticeship Programs through an
   application and approval process.
