   About Us


                                  Why PCB?

   The ITS Professional Capacity Building (PCB) program was established to
        ensure that public transit, highway agency, and motor vehicle
    regulatory professionals have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to
      meet the challenges of deploying ITS as part of the 21st century
                           transportation system.

                          What is the PCB Program?

   The Program is comprehensive and multi-modal in nature, addressing the
   needs of professionals at all levels of government and within academia,
   professional associations, and public and private sector transportation
    agencies. The program is coordinated through U.S. DOT's PCB Program,
       but is a collaboration involving many organizations that bring
   different strengths and expertise to bear on building ITS professional
     capacity. The PCB initiative is designed to meet the education and
     training requirements of three audiences. The "Track 1 Audience" is
     comprised of Existing Professionals. This audience represents those
   individuals who are out of school and currently working or will soon be
    working with ITS technologies. The "Track 2 Audience" is comprised of
   Future Professionals. This audience represents undergraduates, graduate
     students, and faculty. The training objective for this group is to
    facilitate the development of the next generation of ITS leaders. The
     "Track 3 Audience" is comprised of Public Officials and Deployment
       Decision Makers. The objective for this audience is to provide
    information for informed decision making for transportation and ITS.

                Who is working on PCB and what is being done?

        To support the PCB initiative, a cross-section of university,
   government and private sector professionals representing Human Factors
   and Safety, Traffic and Transit Engineering and Management, and Policy
       and Deployment, are working to develop courses, workshops, and
   university curriculum to educate and train those audiences specified by
       the PCB initiative. Furthermore, outreach activities have been
    initiated to educate the community and children about ITS and future
                                   roles.
