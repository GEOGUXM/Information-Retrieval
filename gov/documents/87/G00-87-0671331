Summary

   A centerpiece of almost any discussion about the future of magnetic
   fusion is the proposed International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor
   (ITER). Physics Today invited Thomas Stix and Andrew Sessler to present
   their case against continuation of the ITER project, and Marshall
   Rosenbluth to reply. The debate closes with a brief rebuttal by Stix
   and Sessler. The views of the authors are not necessarily those of
   their employers. A glossary of fusion terms is provided.

   Controlled fusion represents an opportunity to replace fossil fuels and
   nuclear fission as energy sources. Intensive research aimed at the
   peaceful utilization of thermonuclear energy, now in its 46th year, has
   benefited enormously from vigorous international scientific exchange
   and collaboration. Much has already been accomplished. In the approach
   to controlled fusion that uses magnetic confinement---the subject of
   this opinion piece---plasma temperatures obtained in experimental
   devices have risen from a few electron volts to over 40 keV; energy
   confinement times have stretched from tens of microseconds to over a
   second; total nuclear energy output has gone from zero to a few
   megajoules, amounting to about 30% of the externally supplied
   plasma-heating energy.

    Successful controlled fusion will require knowledge that can be gained
   only by research in plasma physics and materials science. In the last
   few years, the proposed International Thermonuclear Experimental
   Reactor has become the focus of future fusion-power research. The
   international fusion research community will soon have to decide
   whether or not to recommend its construction.

    The ITER mission emerged from the 1985 summit meeting between Mikhail
   Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan in Geneva. It is "to demonstrate the
   scientific and technological feasibility of fusion power. The ITER will
   accomplish this by demonstrating controlled ignition and extended burn
   of a deuterium and tritium plasma with steady state as an ultimate
   objective, by demonstrating technologies essential to a reactor in an
   integrated system, and by performing integrated testing of the high
   heat flux and nuclear components required to utilize fusion power for
   practical purposes."[1]

    Even though 11 years have passed since it was formulated, the ITER
   mission still appears to us as premature.

    A conceptual design was completed in 1990, and July 1992 saw the start
   of the ITER Engineering Design Activities (EDA), a six-year
   international program to perform the detailed physics and engineering
   design for an engineering test reactor to reach ignition and remain in
   a state of equilibrium burn for 1000 seconds, while producing 1500 MW
   of fusion power.

   The ITER machine would be genuinely huge.[2] The toroidal field coils
   would be 17-m high. The plasma volume would be 20-40 times larger than
   that of today's largest tokamaks---the Joint European Torus in the UK,
   JT-60 in Japan, the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor at Princeton University
   and DIII-D at General Atomics in San Diego. Toroidal and poloidal field
   coils would both be superconducting, with magnetic fields up to 13
   tesla. Construction time has been estimated at 10-12 years, and
   construction costs, in 1996 dollars, at $10 billion.

    Not surprisingly, the immense cost of the ITER machine has caused the
   US to back away from participation as a major partner in its
   construction. Russia---succeeding the US's original ITER partner, the
   USSR---is eager to participate but unable to offer significant
   financial support. It has been suggested that Japan, with minority
   support from the European Community and with scientific encouragement
   from Russia and the US, may undertake to construct the ITER machine. On
   the other hand, we believe that the US fusion strategy should not hinge
   on Japan's funding and building the machine as now proposed.

    We believe that construction of the ITER machine as it is now being
   designed would be a seriously inappropriate next step for the world's
   fusion community. There are too many unresolved questions. They include
   how to


     * design a divertor that will tolerate the enormous power in the form
       of energetic plasma incident on the strike plates
     * limit damage to the divertor, to the vacuum-chamber walls and to
       the structure from large disruption and halo-current effects
     * limit microscopic and macroscopic plasma instability in the
       proposed operating regime
     * access the required plasma density range
     * accommodate advanced tokamak concepts in the finished machine.

   Other technical challenges include how to construct the largest of the
   superconducting coils on-site, maintain magnetic field errors below the
   extremely stringent locked-mode threshold and limit eddy-current
   heating of the superconducting coils.

    Yet another concern is the immense emphasis on conventional tokamak
   design. It is true that the magnetically confined plasmas most closely
   approaching fusion conditions have been produced in tokamaks. But an
   eventual fusion reactor will likely look very different. Proceeding
   with ITER may not only preempt funding for alternative concepts, but
   also could freeze reactor design and engineering at a premature stage.

    Several major considerations, then, lead us to believe that a decision
   to construct the ITER machine would be a poor choice. They are the
   machine's untested attributes and the unresolved technical issues;
   questions of science policy, including the narrowed focus on
   conventional tokamaks; the diversion and dedication of great human,
   scientific and fiscal resources to this single project; the 10 or more
   years to "first plasma"; the time periods typical for fusion innovation
   and for political change of will; and the negative impact on future
   research that would redound from a mechanical or physics failure in
   this single device. In a few words, the step is too large and the
   overall concept, for all its attractiveness, is both premature and
   overambitious with respect to current knowledge.

    It is also essential to remain aware of the many long-range issues
   involved in attempting to develop an economically competitive fusion
   reactor. Such issues as profile control, burn control, plasma
   disruption, wall erosion, heat exchange, steady-state operation and
   helium-ash disposal are still largely unsolved. Dependence on the
   deuterium-tritium nuclear reaction introduces its own research
   requirements---in particular, low-activation materials to withstand
   damage to the first wall by the 14-MeV neutrons.

    Given the many short- and long-range questions in the field, we
   encourage the formulation of a strategy that would seek answers through
   the utilization and enhancement of existing facilities, through the
   building of new facilities that can be considered reasonable next steps
   and through the exploitation of emerging concepts that could make
   fusion power more accessible. Among substantial new ideas that can be
   explored on existing machines are reversing magnetic shear to produce
   greatly enhanced confinement, using waves to transfer fusion
   alpha-particle energy directly to the ions, and creating localized
   energy transport barriers. Other critical needs include additional
   theoretical work and a significantly increased capability in computer
   simulation.

    Additionally, we suggest the development of a coordinated
   multinational program of research that would lead to the experimental
   achievement of near-ignition conditions.

    Recent fiscal constraints on research emphasize the demand for
   cost-effective solutions. The costs of some experiments are still
   within single-nation budgets---for example, the Ignitor, an ignition
   experiment currently under construction in Italy. Upgrading an existing
   large tokamak in the US to demonstrate near-ignition conditions in the
   plasma core could also be a near-term goal. A follow-on objective would
   be a multinational plasma ignition facility that would invoke advanced
   tokamak concepts to reduce size, construction time and cost. All are
   reasonable next steps, entailing costs that would even allow them to
   overlap in time. Ignition, or near-ignition, is the first requirement
   for a fusion reactor. Unless reproducible plasma conditions close to
   ignition can be achieved, work on other aspects of a reactor will be
   without meaning. Achievement of near-ignition conditions, together with
   the exploration of alpha-particle and burning-plasma physics, would be
   truly impressive research achievements and would signal a major advance
   toward an economically viable fusion reactor.

   We believe that the above suggestions are in full accord with the goals
   identified in recent months by two major committees, the President's
   Committee of Advisers on Science and Technology,[3] and the US
   Department of Energy's Fusion Energy Advisory Committee.[4] Concerning
   ITER, the report of the DOE committee calls for a broad-based
   independent assessment---to be available in December 1996---based on
   the EDA plan. We support such an open review, and we vigorously
   encourage public discussion here and abroad of the policy questions
   cited earlier.

    It seems inevitable that design optimization as well as
   still-outstanding technical, administrative and political issues will
   cause the European Community and Japan to defer their decisions on ITER
   construction well past the mid-1998 completion date for the EDA. US
   contingency planning for this circumstance also needs to be addressed.
   For example, if extending the EDA were to absorb, as at present, 20-25%
   of the US fusion budget, would that be an acceptable and appropriate
   use for these funds?

    The path to economically competitive fusion power still encounters
   unresolved issues. As the needed research continues, it should involve
   using and enhancing existing facilities, increasing present
   capabilities in computer simulation, encouraging near-ignition
   experiments and constructing new experimental facilities that can be
   considered reasonable next steps. Certainly it is appropriate to
   continue strong international scientific exchange and collaboration,
   but let it follow routes for planning and implementation that are more
   attractive and more cost effective than the one now emerging from the
   EDA.

YES

  Marshall N. Rosenbluth

   I agree with Thomas Stix and Andrew Sessler on many of their key
   conclusions: the potential importance of fusion as one of a very
   limited number of future energy possibilities, the great progress that
   has already been made, the need to diversify and explore alternate
   fusion approaches and basic plasma science, the key importance of
   exploiting existing facilities, the opportunities being opened up by
   rapid advances in parallel computation, the critical need for a
   burning-plasma environment for experimental study and the necessity for
   international collaboration.

    How to proceed using limited resources involves subjective judgment,
   and here I disagree strongly with the Stix/Sessler point of view
   regarding the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor.

    There is not space here to engage in any meaningful discussion of the
   very complex physics problems underlying ITER design. The technical
   discussion presented by Stix and Sessler is a laundry list of
   well-known issues being addressed in the course of the ongoing ITER
   Engineering Design Activities (EDA). They do not identify any
   showstoppers; nor do they attempt to quantitatively assess the likely
   success of the EDA's proposed solutions, which are still evolving
   through an international R&D effort aimed at providing a "physics and
   engineering basis" for ITER construction by the end of the EDA, two and
   one-half years from now. A great number of theoretical and experimental
   tasks have been proposed for this period. Many of the issues are
   generic to most fusion reactor designs---high-heat-load divertors,
   14-MeV neutron effects, multimegampere disruptions, confinement at the
   reactor scale and so on. Many of these issues are being faced in a
   realistic way for the first time by ITER designers with the help of the
   international fusion community. Stix and Sessler appear to be
   prejudging the outcome of the EDA design effort as unsatisfactory, and
   even prejudging the political reactions of the European Community and
   Japan to this outcome.

   In my opinion, Stix and Sessler seriously misstate the recommendations
   of the Fusion Energy Advisory Committee for ITER review.[1] The
   committee's executive summary recommendation is to "Plan for the review
   of the ITER EDA and its results and establish criteria for a decision
   on future US participation." Clearly, such a final review of results
   can only come at the end of the EDA. In appendix G of the committee's
   report, mechanisms for this planning are spelled out, including a
   proposal that "The U.S. program should consider launching an assessment
   of the ITER detail[ed] design [end of 1996] modeled after the European
   Domestic Assessment of the ITER Interim design [1995]."[1] The European
   assessment was quite favorable and useful in highlighting certain areas
   for more intense study. Such US reviews of intermediate ITER milestones
   would certainly be important in preparing the US for the required
   in-depth final review.

    The work of the ITER design team is monitored by a technical advisory
   committee of distinguished fusion scientists and engineers from the
   four international partners who judged the interim (midpoint) design to
   be satisfactory progress towards fulfilling ITER's objectives. The
   physics issues are being addressed with the assistance of seven
   international expert groups composed of non-ITER personnel. ITER needs
   and welcomes more active participation by the worldwide fusion
   community.

    It is my conviction, shared by my ITER coworkers, that the nonlinear
   physics and novel engineering issues of fusion are so complex that only
   a real experiment at the approximate parameters required for ignition
   will ever resolve them quantitatively. In fact, it is precisely the
   existence of the laundry list of physics issues that justifies a
   realistic ignition experiment. This has been the position of the US
   fusion community for over a decade. It is critical that ITER be
   designed with sufficient flexibility, and I believe it has been, to
   incorporate new physics knowledge as it evolves in existing facilities
   or in early ITER experiments. (Stix and Sessler cite reversed-shear
   confinement improvement and alpha channeling as good examples.) Of
   course, it may turn out that a new idea is so successful that, with
   hindsight, ITER could safely be redesigned to be smaller and less
   expensive than the present conventional design. It seems to me,
   however, that fusion research requires a test bed such as ITER that we
   could use to design a desirable reactor by interpolation rather than
   continual extrapolation from undersized experiments. It will always be
   possible to argue for indefinite delays in building such a test bed
   while awaiting more perfect knowledge.

    Thus the issues raised by Stix and Sessler are real and well
   recognized, but the conclusions they draw are a subjective judgment as
   to what constitutes a reasonable next step. If objective phrases were
   substituted for the pejorative terms they use---"premature," "genuinely
   huge," "immense cost," "enormous power," "extremely stringent,"
   "over-ambitious," "immense emphasis" among others---then one might
   reach the same conclusions as most of the international fusion
   community has in proposing ITER as its next step.

    Conceptual designs similar to ITER's, and with similar objectives,
   were earlier proposed by the European Community (Next European Torus)
   and Japan (Fusion Experimental Reactor) as national programs, now
   superseded by the international ITER. The US fusion research community
   has long agreed that a not-too-long-delayed ignition or near-ignition
   experiment is crucial for fusion development. There was support in the
   1980s in the US for an ITER-style national machine, but there was more
   support for a nonsuperconducting short-pulse ignition physics
   experiment such as BPX (which, for budgetary reasons, ended up not
   being constructed). This line of development was again recommended in
   the recent study by the President's Committee of Advisers on Science
   and Technology, which proposed an international cryogenic copper,
   100-second-pulse experiment, which could meet many ITER physics
   objectives at 40% of ITER's cost. In contrast to the views of almost
   all my ITER colleagues, this seems to me to be a very reasonable
   proposal, but not one that the US can expect to impose on its partners,
   who strongly prefer a design incorporating more technology, especially
   superconducting magnets, allowing 1000-second pulses, possibly
   steady-state operation, and high neutron fluence. This preference
   arises naturally, especially in the case of Japan, from a more urgent
   perceived energy need and a desire for nondefense-oriented joint
   government/industrial high-technology development.

    I fear that Stix and Sessler have not come to terms with today's
   realities. With the US program now perhaps 15% of the world fusion
   program, probably slipping to the 10% level in the near future, we can
   no longer dictate the nature of the international fusion program.
   Rather, as suggested by the Fusion Energy Advisory Committee, we have
   to exploit and nourish our scientific strengths as best we can on our
   declining budgets by strengthening theory and computational efforts,
   exploring alternate fusion concepts and testing new ideas on existing
   facilities or modest new ones.[1] But, what is equally important, we
   must seek to contribute to and benefit from the crucial large
   experiments existing or being built (alas!) abroad. They include the
   JT-60 upgrade tokamak in Japan; the Joint European Torus, which, if
   desired, might be upgraded much more plausibly than US facilities to a
   short-pulse high-gain (Q = 5) experiment; the German and Japanese
   stellarators; Ignitor, should it actually be constructed (as I very
   much hope it will); and, of course, most important of all---ITER.

    Stix and Sessler allude to a much-discussed hypothetical but quite
   plausible scenario in which Japan assumes the major financial role in
   constructing ITER, with US support at about its present level of 20%
   ($55 million) of the annual US fusion budget. Stix and Sessler oppose
   this as overreliance by the US on Japan's fusion program. To me, on the
   other hand, it would appear to be a wonderful bargain if for 5% of the
   cost we could participate in designing and experimenting on fusion's
   flagship experiment.

    While preserving our scientific strengths with the non-ITER 75-80% of
   our fusion budget, we should also


     * Continue to participate in the EDA to the end (1998), making our
       strong national contribution to the attempt to produce a successful
       design.
     * At the end of the EDA, review the design critically and in depth
       for technical credibility. Consensus should be possible on
       technical credibility, if not on desirability. It is important to
       note in this context that "success" for ITER is not sharply
       defined. The basic physics and technology objectives could be met
       for example with a driven burn at somewhat reduced fusion power,
       thereby lessening quantitative concerns about residual physics
       uncertainties.
     * Assuming that budgetary constraints preclude full US partnership,
       try to be a junior partner in ITER construction abroad, with
       emphasis on scientific participation.
     * Should the other partners decide at some stage that they wish to
       explore designs with more limited objectives, be prepared to do so.
     * If, after the EDA, it becomes clear that ITER will only be a
       perpetual paper study and will not be constructed, then get out.

   After 46 years of effort and progress, the US fusion community should
   think very carefully before turning its back---for whatever
   reasons---on an internationally agreed upon experiment designed as the
   first exploration of the burning plasma environment.

Stix and Sessler reply to Rosenbluth:

   Our major purpose in writing the opinion piece above has been to
   stimulate vigorous open examination, here and abroad, of the technical
   and policy issues relevant to constructing the currently proposed ITER
   machine. At stake is the future of fusion-power research and the
   professional future for literally thousands of physicists and
   engineers.

    We three authors all pursue a common goal, an optimal strategy for
   magnetic-fusion research. We agree on maintaining strong programs in
   basic plasma science, on exploiting existing facilities to address
   problems known to be critical for the operation of every large tokamak,
   on the dedicated exploration of both advanced tokamak scenarios and
   alternative fusion concepts, and on the strong desirability of
   near-term ignition or near-ignition experiments.

    We disagree with Rosenbluth as he notes, over the manner in which
   limited resources should be distributed to accomplish our common
   objectives. We would place priority on the areas just cited and, at the
   same time, seek out new paths that would better employ the substantial
   international resources.

    We are fully aware of the special interests of each partner in ITER
   and in no way do we wish to dictate international strategy. But we
   would be less than honest if we failed to reiterate our opinion, that
   the ITER step is too large and that the time to "first plasma" is too
   long: 12-14 years from now, not including a decision-making delay of
   uncertain length after mid-1998. Conservatism, both fiscal and
   scientific, demands that the fusion community move ahead prudently
   while keeping open its options for significant breakthroughs.
   Accordingly, we advocate a collaborative multinational fusion strategy
   that we believe will answer the most important magnetic fusion reactor
   questions more reliably, quickly, flexibly and cost-effectively than
   the currently proposed single ITER machine.
