                         Overview of Principia Cybernetica


   The present document proposes a highly condensed view of the goals,
   results and organization of the Principia Cybernetica Project, mainly
   for people who already have an idea of what this is all about.

      [PCP-Logo.GIF] The Principia Cybernetica Project (PCP) is a
      collaborative, computer-supported attempt to develop a complete
      cybernetic and evolutionary philosophy. Such a philosophical system
      should arise from a transdisciplinary unification and foundation of the
      domain of Systems Theory and Cybernetics. Similar to the
      metamathematical character of Whitehead and Russell's "Principia
      Mathematica", PCP is metacybernetical: cybernetic tools and methods are
      used to analyze and develop cybernetic theory (see our methodology).

   Tools

      These include the computer-based tools of [externallink.GIF] hypertext,
      electronic mailing lists, electronic publishing, and software for
      knowledge structuring and self-organizing, "learning webs" . They are
      meant to support the process of collaborative theory-building by a
      variety of collaborators, with different backgrounds and living in
      different parts of the world. PCP thus naturally develops as part of
      the emerging intelligent network, the "global brain", supported by the
      protocols of the [externallink.GIF] World Wide Web.

   Structure

      PCP is being developed as a dynamic, multi-dimensional conceptual
      network. The basic architecture consists of nodes, containing
      expositions and definitions of concepts, connected by links,
      representing the associations that exist between the concepts. Both
      nodes and links can belong to different types, expressing different
      semantic and practical categories, organized according to a unified
      format. This network has a quasi-hierarchical structure, with parent
      nodes and child nodes.

   Subject

      As its name implies, PCP focuses on the clarification of fundamental
      concepts and principles of the broadly defined domain of cybernetics
      and systems. This includes related disciplines such as the complex
      adaptive systems and ALife, AI, Cognitive Science, Evolutionary
      Systems, and Memetics. Concepts include: Complexity, Information,
      Entropy, System, Freedom, Control, Self-organization, Emergence, etc.
      Principles are for example Natural Selection, "the whole is more than
      the sum of its parts", and the laws of Requisite Variety, of Requisite
      Hierarchy, and of Regulatory Models. See a provisional list of
      primitive concepts in the form of a semantic network.

   Philosophy

      The PCP philosophical system is to be seen as a clearly thought out and
      well-formulated, global "world view", integrating the different domains
      of knowledge and experience. It should provide an answer to all the
      eternal philosophical questions such as: "Who am I? Where do I come
      from? Where am I going to?".

      The PCP philosophy, which we call "Metasystem Transition Theory", is
      systemic and evolutionary, based on the spontaneous emergence of higher
      levels of organization or control (metasystem transitions) through
      blind variation and natural selection. It includes:

       1. a metaphysics, based on processes or actions as ontological
          primitives,
       2. an epistemology, which understands knowledge as constructed by the
          subject or group, but undergoing selection by the environment;
       3. an ethics, with survival and the continuance of the process of
          evolution as supreme values.

      Philosophy and implementation of PCP are united by their common
      framework based on cybernetic and evolutionary principles: the
      computer-support system is intended to monitor and amplify the
      spontaneous development of knowledge which forms the main theme of the
      philosophy.

   Practical organization

      PCP is a world-wide organization, with many contributors, managed by a
      board of editors (presently V. Turchin (CUNY, New York), C. Joslyn
      (LANL) and F. Heylighen (Free Univ. of Brussels)). Contributors are
      kept informed and participate in discussions through the PCP-news and
      PCP=discuss electronic mailing lists. Further activities of PCP are
      publications in journals or books, and the organization of meetings or
      symposia. PCP has also supported the creation of a number of "spin-off"
      groups, such as the Global Brain Group, and the [externallink.GIF]
      Journal of Memetics. Almost all information gathered by PCP is
      available on the World-Wide Web at http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be, which is
      mirrorred at http://pcp.lanl.gov.
