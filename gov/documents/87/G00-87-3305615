   In the wee morning hours of Sunday, November 18, the Leonid meteor
   shower might intensify into a dazzling meteor storm, with "shooting
   stars" continuously blazing trails across the night sky. Viewers across
   the United States are perfectly positioned to take advantage of the
   storm, which could be among the most spectacular sky events of the 21st
   century according to the latest scientific predictions. more...

   Amateur astronomers interested in helping out monitor the Leonid shower
   could make an effort to collect counts of Leonid meteors in 1-minute
   intervals. It takes the shower about 2 minutes to cross the United
   States from the East Coast to the West Coast. With precise enough data,
   we can see the shower sweep accross the country and recognize
   filamentary structure, if there is any. more...

   On most nights, meteors are so rare that, as folklore has it, a single
   sighting can make your wishes come true. But every now and then, a
   meteor shower will dazzle the eye with thousands of blazing trails
   across the sky in just a few hours. Astronomers call these spectacular
   displays "meteor storms." Of all the meteor showers that occur each
   year, the Leonids of mid-November are the only one known to produce a
   storm in our lifetime. Professional and amateur astronomers alike are
   gearing up for this yearís Leonid shower, because experts predict that
   it could produce two of the best meteor storms in recent memory.

   David Levyís 1991 book The Sky, a Users Guide contains a chapter on
   meteors. That chapter got me started as an amateur meteor observer 10
   years ago. Iíve enjoyed counting, watching, and plotting meteors ever
   since. Meteor observing requires no special equipment other than a dark
   sky, a reclining lawn chair, and you, the observer. more...
