                        Roadmap of the ROOT Web Site
     __________________________________________________________________

   ROOT is, read the following chapters first:

     * Schematic View of the System
       Graphical overview of the different building blocks
     * Architectural Overview
       Overview of the basic system components

   If you are intrigued and want to know more, continue with:
     * The CINT C/C++ Interpreter and Dictionary Generator
       Description of the builtin C/C++ interpreter

       download area

   For a gentle hands-on introduction, follow the tutorials:
     * Tutorials
       Small stand-alone macro's and applications showing many different
       aspects of the system. The tutorials are part of the distribution
       kit.

   You like the system and want to use it for your own application:
     * Become a ROOT User
       Registering will add you to the ROOT mailing list roottalk. Via
       this mailing list you will be kept up to date about important
       ROOT events (new releases, urgent bug fixes, etc.). This list is
       also used to discuss anything concerning ROOT with your fellow
       ROOT users and with the developers.
     * C++ Coding Conventions
       We explain our coding conventions and propose you follow them too

   Before reinventing the wheel have a look a the different HOWTO's:
     * ROOT HOWTO's
       Explanation of some frequently performed operations

   For detailed help on all ROOT classes and members functions, see the
   reference manual:
     * The ROOT Class Categories
       Groups the classes per functional category
     * Classes and Members Reference Guide
       The ultimate reference guide

   If your question persists, have a look at the digest of the roottalk
   mailing list:
     * RootTalk Digest
       Digest of the roottalk mailing list

   See how others are using ROOT:
     * Applications Using ROOT
       Other application based on ROOT.

   Some miscellaneous items, like:
     * Benchmarking Results
       How fast is ROOT on the different supported platforms
     * Plans for Future Development
       What are we planning to add to ROOT for the next releases
     * Publication List
       List of talks and publications concerning ROOT and OOP
     * Picture Gallery
       List of pictures generated by ROOT
     * The ROOT Team
       Who are we, the developers

   And in the unfortunate situation you find a bug in ROOT let us know as

     * Submit a Bug Report

   We hope ROOT will help you solve your problems and that you have fun
   using it.
