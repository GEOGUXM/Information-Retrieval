   II 107TH CONGRESS 1ST SESSION S. 1130 To require the Secretary of
   Energy to develop a plan for a magnetic fusion burning plasma
   experiment for the purpose of accelerating the scientific understanding
   and development of fusion as a long term energy source, and for other
   purposes. IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES JUNE 28, 2001 Mr. CRAIG
   (for himself, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, and Mr. CORZINE) introduced the following
   bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Nat- ural
   Resources A BILL To require the Secretary of Energy to develop a plan
   for a magnetic fusion burning plasma experiment for the purpose of
   accelerating the scientific understanding and development of fusion as
   a long term energy source, and for other purposes. 1 Be it enacted by
   the Senate and House of Representa- 2 tives of the United States of
   America in Congress assembled, 3 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 4 This Act may
   be cited as the ``Fusion Energy 5 Sciences Act of 2001''. 6 SEC. 2.
   FINDINGS. 7 The Congress finds that- 2 1 (1) economic prosperity is
   closely linked to an 2 affordable and ample energy supply; 3 (2)
   environmental quality is closely linked to en- 4 ergy production and
   use; 5 (3) population, worldwide economic develop- 6 ment, energy
   consumption, and stress on the envi- 7 ronment are all expected to
   increase substantially in 8 the coming decades; 9 (4) the few energy
   options with the potential to 10 meet economic and environmental needs
   for the 11 long-term future must be pursued aggressively now, 12 as
   part of a balanced national energy plan; 13 (5) fusion energy is a
   long-term energy solution 14 that is expected to be environmentally
   benign, safe, 15 and economical, and to use a fuel source that is 16
   practically unlimited; 17 (6) the National Academy of Sciences, the 18
   President's Committee of Advisers on Science and 19 Technology, and the
   Secretary of Energy Advisory 20 Board have each recently reviewed the
   Fusion En- 21 ergy Sciences Program and each strongly supports 22 the
   fundamental science and creative innovation of 23 the program, and has
   confirmed that progress to- 24 ward the goal of producing practical
   fusion energy 25 has been excellent; S 1130 IS 3 1 (7) each of these
   reviews stressed the need for 2 the Fusion Energy Sciences Program to
   move for- 3 ward to a magnetic fusion burning plasma experi- 4 ment,
   capable of producing substantial fusion power 5 output and providing
   key information for the ad- 6 vancement of fusion science; 7 (8) the
   National Academy of Sciences has also 8 called for a broadening of the
   Fusion Energy 9 Sciences Program research base as a means to more 10
   fully integrate the fusion science community into the 11 broader
   scientific community; and 12 (9) the Fusion Energy Sciences Program
   budg- 13 et is inadequate to support the necessary science and 14
   innovation for the present generation of experiments, 15 and cannot
   accommodate the cost of a burning plas- 16 ma experiment constructed by
   the United States, or 17 even the cost of key participation by the
   United 18 States in an international effort. 19 SEC. 3. PLAN FOR FUSION
   EXPERIMENT. 20 (a) PLAN FOR UNITED STATES FUSION EXPERI- 21 MENT.-The
   Secretary of Energy (in this Act referred to 22 as ``the Secretary''),
   on the basis of full consultation with, 23 and the recommendation of,
   the Fusion Energy Sciences 24 Advisory Committee (in this Act referred
   to as 25 ``FESAC''), shall develop a plan for United States con- S 1130
   IS 4 1 struction of a magnetic fusion burning plasma experiment 2 for
   the purpose of accelerating scientific understanding of 3 fusion
   plasmas. The Secretary shall request a review of 4 the plan by the
   National Academy of Sciences, and shall 5 transmit the plan and the
   review to the Congress by July 6 1, 2004. 7 (b) REQUIREMENTS OF
   PLAN.-The plan described 8 in subsection (a) shall- 9 (1) address key
   burning plasma physics issues; 10 and 11 (2) include specific
   information on the scientific 12 capabilities of the proposed
   experiment, the rel- 13 evance of these capabilities to the goal of
   practical 14 fusion energy, and the overall design of the experi- 15
   ment including its estimated cost and potential con- 16 struction
   sites. 17 (c) UNITED STATES PARTICIPATION IN AN INTER- 18 NATIONAL
   EXPERIMENT.-In addition to the plan de- 19 scribed in subsection (a),
   the Secretary, on the basis of 20 full consultation with, and the
   recommendation of, 21 FESAC, may also develop a plan for United States
   par- 22 ticipation in an international burning plasma experiment 23 for
   the same purpose, whose construction is found by the 24 Secretary to be
   highly likely and where United States par- 25 ticipation is cost
   effective relative to the cost and scientific S 1130 IS 5 1 benefits of
   a domestic experiment described in subsection 2 (a). If the Secretary
   elects to develop a plan under this 3 subsection, he shall include the
   information described in 4 subsection (b), and an estimate of the cost
   of United 5 States participation in such an international experiment. 6
   The Secretary shall request a review by the National 7 Academies of
   Sciences and Engineering of a plan devel- 8 oped under this subsection,
   and shall transmit the plan 9 and the review to the Congress no later
   than July 1, 2004. 10 (d) AUTHORIZATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOP- 11
   MENT.-The Secretary, through the Fusion Energy 12 Sciences Program, may
   conduct any research and develop- 13 ment necessary to fully develop
   the plans described in this 14 section. 15 SEC. 4. PLAN FOR FUSION
   ENERGY SCIENCES PROGRAM. 16 Not later than 6 months after the date of
   enactment 17 of this Act, the Secretary, in full consultation with 18
   FESAC, shall develop and transmit to the Congress a plan 19 for the
   purpose of ensuring a strong scientific base for 20 the Fusion Energy
   Sciences Program and to enable the 21 experiment described in section
   3. Such plan shall include 22 as its objectives- 23 (1) to ensure that
   existing fusion research fa- 24 cilities and equipment are more fully
   utilized with 25 appropriate measurements and control tools; S 1130 IS
   6 1 (2) to ensure a strengthened fusion science the- 2 ory and
   computational base; 3 (3) to encourage and ensure that the selection 4
   of and funding for new magnetic and inertial fusion 5 research
   facilities is based on scientific innovation 6 and cost effectiveness;
   7 (4) to improve the communication of scientific 8 results and methods
   between the fusion science com- 9 munity and the wider scientific
   community; 10 (5) to ensure that adequate support is provided 11 to
   optimize the design of the magnetic fusion burn- 12 ing plasma
   experiments referred to in section 3; and 13 (6) to ensure that
   inertial confinement fusion 14 facilities are utilized to the extent
   practicable for the 15 purpose of inertial fusion energy research and
   devel- 16 opment. 17 SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 18 There
   are authorized to be appropriated to the Sec- 19 retary for the
   development and review of the plans de- 20 scribed in this Act and for
   activities of the Fusion Energy 21 Sciences Program $320,000,000 for
   fiscal year 2002 and 22 $335,000,000 for fiscal year 2003. Ã† S 1130 IS
