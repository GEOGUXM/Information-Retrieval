      WEBPACER w/Images

   Public access to all of our cases dating back to approximately 1988 are
   now available via WebPacer on the 'world wide web.' Just point and
   click  on the  WebPacer link located on the left hand margin.  You can
   use your same Pacer login and password, just as you did with Pacer.

   As of May 2, 2000, we are proud to announce that document images for
   all cases entered from 1998 to date are available from within
   WebPacer.   There is a charge to view the documents (7 cents/page.)
   Cost information will be given  prior to downloading the image.  Proof
   of claim images are also availabe for most recently filed cases.
   NOTE:  You may need a tiff  viewer to view the images.  If you require
   a tiff viewer visit our OTHER LINKS page or you can download the WANG
   VIEWER after you enter the WebPacer program.  The WANG VIEWER is a free
   download (version is for Windows 95 PCs.)

   WebPacer provides Internet access to our case information and will
   serve as an alternative to our dial-up Pacer system via a modem.  To
   establish an account, please contact the Pacer Service Center at
   1-800-676-6856.
