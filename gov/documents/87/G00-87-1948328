                               Solar Magnetic Fields

      Magnetism is the key to understanding the Sun. Magnetism, or magnetic
      field, is produced on the Sun by the flow of electrically charged ions
      and electrons. Sunspots are places where very intense magnetic lines of
      force break through the Sun's surface. The sunspot cycle results from
      the recycling of magnetic fields by the flow of material in the
      interior. The prominences seen floating above the surface of the Sun
      are supported, and threaded through, with magnetic fields. The
      streamers and loops seen in the corona are shaped by magnetic fields.
      Magnetic fields are at the root of virtually all of the features we see
      on and above the Sun. Without magnetic fields the Sun would be a rather
      boring star.

                             Measuring Magnetic Fields

      Magnetic forces change the direction of motion of moving charged
      particles like electrons. Because of this, electrons that orbit around
      a nucleus in one direction will have more energy than electrons that
      orbit about the nucleus in the opposite direction. This allows us to
      remotely measure the Sun's magnetic field by observing the difference
      in the energy of the light emitted as these electrons jump from orbit
      to orbit. With the proper instrumentation we can determine both the
      strength and the direction of the magnetic field all across the surface
      of the Sun.

                             Modeling Magnetic Fields

      Magnetic field lines loop through the solar atmosphere and interior to
      form a complicated web of magnetic structures. Many of these structures
      are visible in the chromosphere and corona, the outermost layers of the
      Sun's atmosphere. However, we usually measure the magnetic field itself
      in the photosphere, the innermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere.
      Techniques can be used to mathematically map these magnetic field lines
      into the outer layers where they can be compared with the observed
      structures.

                             Predicting Space Weather

      A better understanding of the Sun's magnetic field and its behavior
      will allow us to make better predictions of space weather. Observations
      of magnetic fields associated with solar flares show that flares are
      likely to occur when the magnetic field lines linking two sunspots
      become sheared or twisted. Observations of the Sun's magnetic field
      over the last 20 years illustrates its behavior over two sunspot
      cycles. However, predicting long-range behavior, such as the size of
      the sunspot cycle, is still based on observing trends and patterns.  We
      hope that in the near future we will understand the Sun well enough to
      make these predictions based on current conditions and past history
      using a mathematical model of the actual processes.
