       Product Data Standards for Steel Construction

       Principal Investigator: Robert Lipman   Revised:

         __________________________________________________________________

       Objective:

       To accelerate the industry adoption of product data standards
       supporting the integration and automation of the project delivery
       process for steel structures.

       Problem:

       An effective project delivery process depends on the availability of
       current and correct information for all the participants, wherever they
       are and whenever they need it. Achieving the seamless integration of
       project information has become a primary goal for many organizations
       associated with the building and construction industries, ranging from
       the newly formed FIATECH Consortium to the Construction and Building
       Committee of the Presidents Science and Technology Council. Ongoing
       benchmarking studies by organizations like the Business Roundtable and
       the Construction Industry Institute confirm the business stake in this
       goal.The CONSIAT and FIATECH programs envision a number of technology
       developments that will make more and richer information available to
       project participants, including more complete descriptions of the
       project design itself and of the products and services procured for the
       project, large amounts of previously unavailable spatio-temporal
       information supporting the realization of the project design on the
       construction site, and comprehensive commissioning procedures tied to
       the as-built condition of the resulting facility.
       The American Institute for Steel Construction as part of their
       Electronic Data Interchange initiative has adopted the CIMSteel
       Integration Standard CIS2, a standard developed in the UK and Europe,
       based on ISO/STEP technology. CIS2 is an exemplar of the kind of
       standards needed to automate and integrate the project delivery
       process. However, AISC members need help in understanding this
       manifestation of STEP technology, in implementing the standard in their
       software applications, and in using it as the basis for project
       integration.

       Approach:

       Work to date in this project has established the general applicability
       of the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) in creating the display
       system for a web-based 3D graphical user interface for steel
       structures. Developed by the Web3D Consortium and promulgated as
       ISO/IEC 14772, the VRML specification provides a software-independent
       basis for describing 3D objects that can be accessed and viewed using
       widely available Web browser technology.
       Intelligent VRML data structures for various geometric and pose-related
       information has been developed that map closely to their corresponding
       CIS2 entities. The data structures are based on the VRML prototype
       mechanism. A program for directly translating a CIS2 file to VRML is
       under continual development. This program is being used in related BFRL
       projects that address the tracking of steelwork construction on a real
       site and the related project-information management system issues such
       as the use of time-stamps on CIS2 data instances to recording the
       tracking information. Technical papers are being prepared to document
       this work.
       Vendors of structural steel analysis, design, and fabrication software
       have expressed an interest in the CIS2 VRML work as have the American
       Institute for Steel Construction, Georgia Tech, and the Steel
       Construction Institute (UK). The online version of the CIS2 to VRML
       translator has been used by steel software vendors to verify their CIS2
       export capabilities and has led to the identification several problems
       with the available CIS2 test cases and the CIS2 specification.
       In FY 2002, work will continue on the development of translation of
       CIS2 to VRML and the creation of new VRML data structures. Methods will
       be explored for visualizing non-geometric information, metadata, and
       data management related to a steel assembly, frame, or structure.
       The continual development of the VRML visualization will help vendors
       verify the export capabilities of their software. Robust
       project-related CIS2 test cases will be created to aid software vendors
       in verifying the correctness and completeness of their CIS2 file
       import. Such test cases will be built using information drawn from NIST
       construction projects, most notably the addition of a new emissions
       control system to Building 205 at the NIST Gaithersburg site.
       An analysis model of the Building 205 emissions control system
       structure will be developed and integrated with the CIS2 manufacturing
       model of the structure. A structural analysis will be performed and the
       results also integrated into the CIS2 model. A structural damage
       scenario will be developed and used as the basis for investigating the
       use of CIS2 in the evaluation of the strength and integrity of an
       existing, damaged structure.
       The VRML interface will be used as a front-end to a database management
       system for CIS2 data being developed at Georgia Tech and BFRL will work
       collaboratively with Georgia Tech researchers to inter-compare CIS2
       implementations and to extend test case data sets. Several enhancements
       to the VRML interface are required to use it as a front-end
       visualization system.
       The prior work in adding temporal information to CIS2 will be used as a
       basis to investigate the use of CIS2 for virtual construction and
       digital as-built documentation. The as-built documentation can be
       thought of as providing a snapshot in time of the completed state of a
       construction project.
