      SFWMD CONTINUES LAKE OKEECHOBEE WATER RELEASES TO BENEFIT ESTUARY

   The South Florida Water Management District continued releasing fresh
   water from Lake Okeechobee yesterday to the Caloosahatchee River and
   estuary to maintain recovery of grass beds that were threatened by high
   salinity levels. The small pulse releases were initiated Dec. 20 and
   continued, as needed, for 30 days to moderate salinity levels near an
   indicator grass bed located about 15 miles upstream of Shell Point.
   Results of monitoring show that the initial series of releases from the
   lake, combined with stormwater runoff from the basin, have successfully
   moderated salinity in the river and estuary. Additional releases are
   required to maintain salinity at present levels consistent with the
   intent of Caloosahatchee minimum flows and levels rules.

   "This is good news for the environment," said District Executive
   Director Henry Dean. "With the lake level at 14.68 feet today, plus the
   very positive response we got from last month's releases, the grass
   beds are clearly showing signs of recovery."

   Any stormwater runoff in the area can also continue to reduce the
   amount of water required from Lake Okeechobee to the estuary ecosystem.

   The environmental pulses will continue for up to 30 days from
   structures S-77 and S-79, and will be carefully monitored to moderate
   the salinity level and the health of the grass beds in the area.
   Comprehensive studies and extensive monitoring of the Caloosahatchee
   ecological system will determine the need for additional releases.

   The District will coordinate with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as
   well as the Florida Department of Environmental Protection on a weekly
   basis for the next four weeks in order to confirm the need for
   additional pulse releases. This action is consistent with the Corps
   Water Control Plan for Lake Okeechobee and the District's authority to
   allocate water releases.

              Florida Friendly Landscaping: an Overview of the
                    Florida Yards & Neighborhoods Program

   A Florida Yards & Neighborhoods Program Overview is the next topic of
   the lecture series sponsored by the South Florida Water Management
   District's (SFWMD) Okeechobee Service Center. The lecture will be held
   at 3 p.m. on Tuesday, January 29th.

   The presentation will be given by Fred Burkey, Martin County
   Cooperative Extension Service Agent. The Florida Yards & Neighborhoods
   Program was developed to address serious problems of pollution and
   disappearing habitats by enlisting homeowners in the battle to protect
   our waterways. The program provides special educational and outreach
   activities in the community to help residents reduce pollution and
   enhance their environment by improving home and landscape management.

   Homeowners can significantly contribute to the reduction of phosphorus
   leaching into Lake Okeechobee through fairly simple activities that
   will not only reduce fertilizer and pesticide runoff, but enhance their
   homes at the same time. There are nine basic principles of landscape
   design and maintenance. Please join us to learn how you can have a
   "Florida friendly yard"!

   Lectures on a variety of topics of interest to local citizens will be
   given on Tuesday afternoons, at 3 p.m. The next lecture will be on
   February 12th on "Phosphorus reduction techniques at Candler Ranch
   using Phos-philter technology" by Larry Madrid from Madrid Engineering
   Group, Inc.

   All members of the public are invited to attend the lecture, which is
   free of charge. It will be held in the SFWMD Okeechobee Service Center
   auditorium on the second floor of the Bank of America building in
   downtown Okeechobee.

   The SFWMD Okeechobee Service Center is located at 205 N. Parrott Ave.,
   Suite 201. For more information about the lecture series, please
   contact the Okeechobee Service Center at (800) 250-4200.

                     WATER CONTROL STRUCTURE MAINTENANCE
         TO TEMPORARILY IMPACT WATER SUPPLY RELEASES, LOCAL TRAFFIC

   Two South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) water control
   structures south of Lake Istokpoga in Highlands County are scheduled
   for required maintenance during the next month. This maintenance will
   require the structure bays to be drained of water, which will cause
   temporary inconveniences to landowners and travelers in the area.

   The first structure scheduled for maintenance is the S-83 water control
   structure located on the C-41A canal. This water control structure,
   which is primarily used to deliver agricultural water supply, will be
   out of operation for approximately two weeks beginning on Tuesday,
   January 22. Contractors employed by the SFWMD will use a crane to place
   needle beams within the structure bay before the water is drained from
   the bay. Once it is dry, the inside of the bay will be sandblasted and
   then new concrete will be applied to ensure the continued integrity of
   the structure. This maintenance will temporarily interrupt water supply
   deliveries in the C-41A canal downstream of the structure. Landowners
   in the area were consulted concerning the timing of this maintenance.

   Similar work will be performed on each of the three bays at the S-68
   water control structure at the south end of Lake Istokpoga, following
   completion of the maintenance at S-83. Only one of the bays will be
   taken out of service at a time, so there will be no impact on water
   supply deliveries or on flood control for residents in the area of Lake
   Istokpoga. However, the crane that places the needle beams in the
   structure bay so that it can be drained, will have to temporarily block
   traffic on CR 621 while that work is being performed. No estimate of
   the length of time that road traffic will be interrupted is available
   at this time. A second press release will be issued when the exact date
   and length of traffic interruptions is known.

   The SFWMD regrets any inconveniences this necessary maintenance may
   cause and thanks residents in advance for their patience with these
   required services. For more information, please contact the SFWMD
   Okeechobee Service Center at (863) 462-5260 or (800) 250-4200. The
   office is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays, but please feel free to
   leave a voice mail message over the weekend and we will return your
   call as quickly as possible.

     SFWMD, CORPS TO HOLD WORKSHOP CONCERNING LAKE BELT RESERVOIR PILOT
                               PROJECT OF CERP

   The South Florida Water Management District and U.S. Army Corps of
   Engineers will hold a public information workshop on the Draft Project
   Management Plan for the Lake Belt In-Ground Reservoir Technology Pilot
   Project on Wednesday, January 16, from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at the
   SFWMD Miami Field Station, 9001 NW 58th Street, Miami.

   During the workshop, District and Corps staff will describe the pilot
   project and seek public input for the development of the Lake Belt
   In-Ground Reservoir Technology Pilot Project Management Plan. The draft
   project management plan will be available at the SFWMD Miami Field
   Station and is posted on the Web at
   http://www.evergladesplan.org/pm/projects/proj23.shtml.

   The Lake Belt In-Ground Reservoir Pilot Project, located in northwest
   Miami-Dade County, will determine construction technologies, storage
   efficiencies, impacts on local hydrology, and water quality effects.
   Water quality assessments will include a determination as to whether
   the in-ground reservoirs and seepage barriers will allow for storage of
   untreated waters without concern for groundwater contamination.

   The Lake Belt In-Ground Reservoir Technology Pilot Project is a
   component of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). The
   25-30-year plan will restore the Everglades through a series of civil
   engineering and environmental projects and improvements and will cost
   approximately $7.8 billion.

                2002 EVERGLADES CONSOLIDATED REPORT RELEASED
        Comprehensive report used for water resource decision-making

   The South Florida Water Management District and the Florida Department
   of Environmental Protection announce the publication of the
   peer-reviewed 2002 Everglades Consolidated Report. The report, the
   fourth in an annual series, is a cooperative effort by these agencies
   to comply with reporting obligations under the Everglades Forever Act
   and to support water resource decision-making in South Florida. It
   summarizes the available data and findings from water samples collected
   from May 1, 2000, through April 30, 2001 (Water Year 2001).

   "Overall, the report conveys the good news that Everglades restoration
   programs are progressing on schedule," said District Executive Director
   Henry Dean. Phosphorus-reducing agricultural best management practices
   in the Everglades Agricultural Area south of Lake Okeechobee and
   constructed wetlands called stormwater treatment areas in Palm Beach
   and Hendry counties are cleansing stormwater beyond expectations as it
   moves southward into the Everglades. Wading bird nests in South Florida
   were estimated at over 38,000 making the year 2001 one of the best in a
   decade.

   "The information summarized in this report has been very helpful in our
   recommendation of a new phosphorous standard and other key decisions.
   Further, the report accurately provides good news about the substantial
   progress that we've made this past year toward Everglades restoration,"
   said DEP Secretary David Struhs.

   Many examples in the 2002 Everglades Consolidated Report demonstrate
   that the scientific underpinning and environmental planning for
   Everglades restoration efforts remain strong. Key findings highlighted
   in the report include:

   Everglades research supports a 10 parts per billion phosphorus citerion
   for the Everglades: Findings from the northern Everglades indicate that
   a total phosphorus criterion of 10 ppb would protect plants and animals
   without being overly protective. Remaining issues to be decided include
   establishing the appropriate measurement locations and compliance
   methodology.

   Everglades ecosystems functioned quite well despite the stress of the
   2001 drought: Drought conditions were a dominant factor influencing
   Everglades ecology for Water Year 2001. In spite of this stress,
   ecosystems in the Everglades functioned quite well. Nesting activity
   was very successful for several key wading bird species during the
   year, and fires were limited to rejuvenating surface burns.

   Water quality compliance in the Everglades is generally very good:
   Evaluation of water quality by the Florida Department of Environmental
   Protection for Water Year 2001 indicates that Everglades water quality
   generally meets state quality criteria.

   Reductions in mercury pollution benefit Everglades: Most mercury enters
   the Everglades from the air and is transformed rapidly in the marshes
   into a chemical form that can accumulate to high and dangerous levels
   and pose a risk to wildlife and humans alike. Emissions of mercury into
   the air over Florida have been reduced greatly since 1990, and there
   are signs that these reductions are benefiting the Everglades.

   Stormwater phosphorus moving from the Everglades Agricultural Area has
   been consistently reduced: For the sixth consecutive year, best
   management practices on farms have reduced phosphorus loads from the
   Everglades Agricultural Area to a greater extent (73 percent) than is
   required by the Everglades Forever Act (25 percent).

   Stormwater treatment areas (STAs) are performing well: Four of the six
   stormwater treatment areas are fully operational and removed more than
   24 metric tons of phosphorus, for an overall 65 percent removal rate.
   Monitoring of these wetlands demonstrated that they are in full
   compliance with the state operating permits.

   Exotic plants threaten Everglades: Although many exotic plants and
   animals may have negative impacts on the Everglades, Old World climbing
   fern now represents the single greatest exotic threat to the ecosystem.

   Long-term water quality solutions will integrate research findings,
   Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) projects and
   regulatory actions. The District and the Florida Department of
   Environmental Protection are aggressively conducting research on
   optimizing STA performance and advanced treatment technologies
   (phosphorus-reducing biological and chemical treatment technologies),
   implementing CERP project plans, and finalizing water quality standards
   for the Everglades. These efforts will culminate in selections of water
   quality improvement plans for all discharges to the Everglades, with
   the ambitious target completion date of December 31, 2006. Potential
   challenges to meeting this target include resolving the remaining
   technical and regulatory uncertainties and obtaining sufficient
   funding.

   The complete 2002 Everglades Consolidated Report, which includes an
   executive summary, scientific report and appendices, is available on
   the District's Web site at www.sfwmd.gov/org/ema/everglades. Printed
   copies of the executive summary with CD containing the comprehensive
   scientific report and appendices are available by calling the
   District's Technical Publication office at (561) 682-6745.

    SOUTH FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT APPLAUDS EVERGLADES AGREEMENT

   The South Florida Water Management District applauds an agreement
   signed yesterday by President George W. Bush and Governor Jeb Bush that
   provides several critical commitments to ensure implementation of the
   Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP).
   "Keep in mind that the President only signs treaties, national
   proclamations and federal acts of law," said Governing Board Chair
   Trudi Williams at today's monthly board meeting in West Palm Beach. "It
   is unprecedented for the President to be signing this kind of agreement
   and personally making the commitments he has made."
   One of the commitments outlined in the agreement states that the State
   of Florida establishes reservations of water to protect environmental
   water supply, and to base these reservations on information developed
   in project implementation reports that are jointly developed by the
   South Florida Water Management District and the U.S. Army Corps of
   Engineers. Another commitment by the President and the Governor is
   concerning continuous funding for CERP.
   "This agency shall have the responsibility of developing state
   reservations of water to protect environmental water supplies," said
   Williams. "This historical agreement clearly makes the reservation
   process a linchpin to the success of Everglades restoration."
   A special Governing Board Public Workshop is planned in March to
   discuss a long-term strategy for developing and establishing state
   water reservations (time and date will be advertised to the public).

             SFWMD INITIATES ENVIRONMENTAL WATER SUPPLY RELEASE

   In compliance with Caloosahatchee River minimum flows and levels rules,
   the South Florida Water Management District is releasing small amounts
   of water from Lake Okeechobee to the Caloosahatchee River and estuary
   for environmental water supply purposes.

   The low-level fresh water releases from Lake Okeechobee will greatly
   benefit the estuary's ecological system, specifically the recovery of
   grass beds that are currently threatened by high salinity levels.
   Recent ecological analysis performed by the District indicate that
   under current conditions along the Caloosahatchee, the estuary grass
   beds now require a fresh water infusion to continue a steady and
   healthy recovery.

   The environmental pulse releases will begin at 7 a.m. on Thursday,
   December 20th and could continue for up to 30 days. Any stormwater
   runoff in the area could reduce the amount of water required from Lake
   Okeechobee to the estuary ecosystem.

   The releases from S-77 and S-79 will be carefully monitored to moderate
   the salinity level in the area consistent with the intent of the
   District's minimum flows and levels rules. Comprehensive studies and
   extensive monitoring of the Caloosahatchee ecological system will
   determine the need for additional releases.

   The District will coordinate with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on a
   weekly basis in order to confirm the need for additional pulse
   releases. This action is consistent with the Corps Water Control Plan
   for Lake Okeechobee and the District's authority to allocate water
   releases.

                 SFWMD ACQUIRES PORTION OF ALLAPATTAH RANCH
                         FOR EVERGLADES RESTORATION

   The South Florida Water Management District Governing Board approved
   the purchase of 13,186 acres of the Allapattah Ranch in north central
   Martin County at yesterday's board meeting at District headquarters in
   West Palm Beach. The land has long been in the District's Save Our
   Rivers Program, Martin County's land acquisition wish list, and most
   recently designated as a key component of the Indian River Lagoon
   Feasibility Study, an element of the Comprehensive Everglades
   Restoration Plan (CERP).

   Cost-sharing partners include Martin County through its 1-cent sales
   tax referendum, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wetland Reserve
   Program and the South Florida Water Management District.

   The $29.7 million acquisition was passed unanimously by the Governing
   Board and was greatly supported by Martin County Commission members in
   attendance.

   "This parcel represents a key acquisition to the implementation of the
   Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan in Martin and St. Lucie
   counties. We applaud Martin County's elected officials and citizens for
   their proactive support," said Governing Board Vice Chairman Len
   Lindahl.

   "We commend the District for their partnership with Martin County in
   implementing this major component of CERP. We thank the citizens of
   Martin County for their tax dollars, which have helped make this
   acquisition possible," said Martin County Commission Chairperson Elmira
   Gainey.

          Rock mining pits to be tested as water supply reservoirs

           RIBBON CUTTING CEREMONY SCHEDULED FOR TUESDAY, DEC. 11

                                                                     WHAT:

   Ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the completed first phase of the
   L-8 Reservoir Testing Project -- turning large rock mining pits into
   billion-gallon water storage areas. Guest speakers will include members
   of the contributing partners: State Representative Jeff Atwater; South
   Florida Water Management District Governing Board Member Patrick
   Gleason; South Florida Water Management District Executive Director
   Henry Dean; Indian Trail Improvement District President William
   Gotthelf; Palm Beach County Commissioner Tony Masilotti; and West Palm
   Beach Mayor Joel Daves.

                                                                     WHEN:

   Tuesday, December 11, at 10 a.m.

                                                                    WHERE:

   Palm Beach Aggregates, Inc., 20125 State Road 80, Loxahatchee.

   The L-8 Reservoir Testing Project is a two-to-three year project to
   determine the feasibility and effectiveness of using the mined area of
   the Palm Beach Aggregates site as a water storage and flood-control
   reservoir. During significant rain events, stormwater runoff collected
   in the L-8 Canal is generally sent to the Lake Worth Lagoon. By using a
   gravity flow gate system and twin 72-inch pipes, stormwater runoff in
   the L-8 Canal can now be directed into giant rock mining pits capable
   of holding approximately 1 billion gallons each. Testing will be
   conducted at the mining site and surrounding area to analyze water
   quality and quantity, geo-technical and hydro-geological data. If water
   quality measurements are determined to be acceptable, large pumps will
   be installed to pump water held in the mining pits to areas of the
   county needing additional water for environmental enhancement and water
   supply, especially during drought conditions. At Tuesday's ribbon
   cutting, the gates will be opened and millions of gallons of water will
   flow in to the initial test reservoirs.
