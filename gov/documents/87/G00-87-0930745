   The primary instruments and measurements are:
          + Ozone lidar (vertical profiles of ozone from the tropopause to
            at least 40 km altitude; in some cases tropospheric ozone will
            also be measured)
          + Temperature lidar (vertical profiles of temperature from about
            30 to 80 km)
          + Aerosol lidar (vertical profiles of aerosol optical depth in
            the lower stratosphere)
          + Water vapor  lidar (vertical profiles of water vapor in the
            lower stratosphere)
          + Ozone microwave (vertical profiles of stratospheric ozone from
            20 to 70 km)
          + H2O microwave (vertical profiles water vapor from about 20 to
            80 km)
          + CLO microwave (vertical profiles of CLO from about 25 to 45
            km, depending on latitude)
          + Ultraviolet/Visible spectrograph (column abundance of ozone,
            NO2, and, at some latitudes, OCLO and BrO)
          + Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (column abundances of
            a broad range of species including ozone, HCL, NO, NO2,
            CLONO2, and HNO3)
