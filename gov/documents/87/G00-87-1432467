   Waste Isolation Pilot Plant

   WIPP is the world's first underground repository licensed to safely and
   permanently dispose of transuranic radioactive waste left from the
   research and production of nuclear weapons. Located 26 miles from
   Carlsbad, New Mexico, in the Chihuahuan Desert, project facilities
   include disposal rooms mined 2,150 feet underground in a 2,000-foot
   thick salt formation that has been stable for more than 200 million
   years.   Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (Carlsbad, NM)
