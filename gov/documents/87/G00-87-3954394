   Strengthening democracy, bolstering human rights, and promoting
   political dialogue are among the pillars of U.S. Western Hemisphere
   policy. The agenda of the House Policy Subcommittee on the Americas
   reflects President Bush's goal of a common market stretching across a
   hemisphere of free, fair trade, and common values.
