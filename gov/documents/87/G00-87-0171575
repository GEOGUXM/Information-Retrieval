   Form B240-3/99
   Note: This revised Form B 240 can be used when a bankruptcy debtor has
   agreed to reaffirm a debt to a creditor under Sec. 524(c) of the
   Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 524(c).  This form was developed by the
   Advisory Committe on Bankruptcy Rules and is issued as a service to the
   Court and the parties in bankruptcy proceedings under Rule 9009 of the
   Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.  This is a procedural form,
   rather than an official bankruptcy form; therefore, use of this form is
   not mandatory but is strongly recommended.

                       UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT

   Creditor's Name and Address

   Instructions: 1) Attach a copy of all court judgments, security
   agreements, and evidence of their perfection.
                           2) File all the documents by mailing them or
   delivering them to the Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court.

                              NOTICE TO DEBTOR:

   This agreement gives up the protection of your bankruptcy discharge for
   this debt.

   As a result of this agreement, the creditor may be able to take your
   property or wages if you do not pay the agreed amounts. The creditor
   may also act to collect the debt in other ways.

   You may rescind (cancel) this agreement at any time before the
   bankruptcy court enters a discharge order or within 60 days after this
   agreement is filed with the court, whichever is later, by notifying the
   creditor that the agreement is canceled.

   You are not required to enter into this agreement by any law. It is not
   required by the Bankruptcy Code, by any other law, or by any contract
   (except another reaffirmation agreement made in accordance with
   Bankruptcy Code ยง 524(c)).

   You are allowed to pay this debt without signing this agreement.
   However, if you do not sign this agreement and are later unwilling or
   unable to pay the full amount, the creditor will not be able to collect
   it from you. The creditor also will not be allowed to take your
   property to pay the debt unless the creditor has a lien on that
   property.

   If the creditor has a lien on your personal property, you may have a
   right to redeem the property and eliminate the lien by making a single
   payment to the creditor equal to the current value of the property, as
   agreed by the parties or determined by the court.

   This agreement is not valid or binding unless it is filed with clerk of
   the bankruptcy court. If you were not represented by an attorney during
   the negotiation of this reaffirmation agreement, the agreement cannot
   be enforced by the creditor unless 1) you have attended a reaffirmation
   hearing in the bankruptcy court, and 2) the agreement has been approved
   by the bankruptcy court. (Court approval is not required if this is a
   consumer debt secured by a mortgage or other lien on your real estate.)
