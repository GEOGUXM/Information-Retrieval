   The Washington State Public Works Act requires that employees of
   government contractors be paid the prevailing wages for all public
   work. Prevailing wage is the wage paid to the majority of workers in a
   trade.  Separate prevailing wages are available for each Washington
   county and trade.  Agencies awarding public works contracts include
   state agencies, counties, municipalities and all other political
   subdivisions of the state.
