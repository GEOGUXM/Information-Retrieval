   You will need an MPEG player to view these movies. If you don't have an
   MPEG player, we recommend QuickTime which allows you to view a wide
   range of movie formats.
   NOTICE: because of lack of resources, the 7-day and movies will not be
   updated. The files will be archived though for later use.

                             Default Parameters

   Every day, a set of default images are created using the various files
   that are produced by the polar systems. These images are used by FPDT
   on a routine basis to monitor the health of the systems. The links
   below will take you to pages that show thumbnail images of the default
   images

   The default images are separated into 2 time periods. They are also
   separated into 3 parameter groups which are described below

     Time Period 2 (18z of the previous day and 07z of the current day)

               N-14 (Sat2) Parm List 1 Parm List 2 Parm List 3
               N-14 (Sat4) Parm List 1 Parm List 2 Parm List 3

    The 3 Parameter Groups:
