   NOAA Research, conducted primarily through the Office of Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Research, drives the NOAA environmental products and
   services that protect life and property and promote sustainable
   economic growth. Research, conducted by in-house laboratories and by
   extramural programs, focuses on enhancing our understanding of
   environmental phenomena such as tornadoes, hurricanes, climate
   variability, solar flares, changes in the ozone, El Ni単o/La Ni単a
   events, fisheries productivity, ocean currents, deep sea thermal vents,
   and coastal ecosystem health. NOAA research also develops innovative
   technologies and observing systems. All divisions of NOAA conduct
   research in their respective disciplines.

   The NOAA Research network consists of 12 internal research
   laboratories, extramural research atat a network of more than 200
   institutions participating in the 29 Sea Grant university and research
   programs, six undersea research centers, a research grants program
   through the Office of Global Programs, and 11 cooperative institutes
   with academia. Through NOAA and its academic partners, thousands of
   scientists, engineers, technicians, and graduate students participate
   in furthering our knowledge of natural phenomena that affect the lives
   of us all.

   Atmospheric Research - Every day, NOAA scientists and their research
   partners are expanding the atmospheric body of knowledge, shedding new
   light on the processes that contribute to the world's weather and
   developing new tools for predicting it.

   Climate Research - NOAA's research laboratories, Office of Global
   Programs, and research partners conduct a wide range of research into
   complex climate systems and how they work. These scientists want to
   improve their ability to predict climate variation in both the shorter
   termlike cold spells or periods of droughtand over longer terms like
   centuries and beyond.

   Fisheries Research - Sound scientific research is the basis for
   sustainable fisheries. To help ensure productive future harvests, NOAA
   Fisheries scientists study the life history, stock size, and ecology of
   economically important fishes, and the effects of climate and ocean
   processes on their populations. This information is used by fisheries
   managers to set annual quotas, or the amount of fish that can be
   harvested each year.

   National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science - conduct and support
   monitoring, research, assessment, and technical assistance for the
   range of NOAA's coastal stewardship responsibilities.

   Ocean & Coastal Research - NOAA explores and investigates ocean
   habitats and resources. It provides scientific results to help manage
   and understand fisheries, conserve and protect our coasts, and build a
   stronger economy through marine products and businesses, such as
   biotechnology and aquaculture. The agency also looks for changes in the
   oceans and Great Lakes due to natural and human activities.

   NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center - is the national repository
   for geophysical data, providing a wide range of science data services
   and information. The center provides long-term stewardship for and
   access to geophysical data, compiles new, well-documented databases
   from many sources, and offers value-added data services to researchers
   and the general public.

   Paleoclimatology Program - is working with scientists from around the
   world to study past climate in hopes of achieving a better
   understanding of the Earth's climate of today and that of the future.

   Space Weather Research - NOAA's Space Environment Center (SEC), located
   in Boulder, Colo., is the national and world warning center for
   disturbances that can affect people and equipment working in the space
   environment. Understanding the space environment and being able to
   accurately predict turbulent space weather is critical to the nation as
   we face a changing world that includes more and more orbiting
   satellites, satellite-based communication networks, and global
   positioning systems for ship and airline navigation.

   What is Global Warming? A Historical Perspective - The term Global
   Warming refers to the observation that the atmosphere near the Earth's
   surface is warming, without any implications for the cause or
   magnitude. This warming is one of many kinds of climate change that the
   Earth has gone through in the past and will continue to go through in
   the future.
