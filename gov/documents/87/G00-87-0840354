                         Bush Administration Devotes
                      More Money to Global Disease Fund

                         New resources committed as
                      fund directors hold first meeting

     U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Tommy G. Thompson
     announced January 28 that the Bush Administration has increased its
       contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and
     Malaria. President Bush has earmarked $200 million for the fund in
           2003, in addition to $300 million previously committed.

    Thompson made the announcement as the board of directors for the fund
   holds its first meeting in Geneva, Switzerland January 28-29. The idea
    for an international funding mechanism to support initiatives against
     disease first emerged at the Okinawa G-8 summit in 2000, and gained
    momentum in 2001 with advocacy from U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
    and the initial contribution from the United States of $200 million.

     "This fund will have worldwide impact on three of the world's most
    devastating health threats," Secretary Thompson said. "Today, before
    the fund even opens its door, the president has pledged half billion
                        dollars toward its efforts."

     The three diseases account for more than 6 million deaths each year
   worldwide. The illnesses cause enormous suffering for their victims and
   their families, but international experts have also concluded in recent
    years that the diseases are thwarting economic growth and development
                            in poor nations. more
