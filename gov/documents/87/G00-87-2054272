Prison Industry Authority License Plate Factory

   California's License Plate Factory is operated by the Prison Industry
   Authority (PIA) and produces an average of 5.5 million license plates
   annually. All of the production is accomplished with a workforce of
   approximately 130 inmates. PIA also has a full-service machine shop
   that maintains the specialized equipment required for making plates.

   Since 1947, all of California's license plates have been manufactured
   by the inmates at Folsom State Prison. Initially, the factory was in a
   surplus airplane hanger which is located in the old granite quarry. In
   1953, the entire operation was dismantled and relocated by the staff
   from the old California Correctional Industries. The reassembled
   factory was located in what is called the Upper Yard. Originally, the
   "Tag Plant" manufactured the license plates as well as the metal
   validation tabs. Back then, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)
   issued all vehicles new license plates periodically and the metal
   validation tabs were issued annually.

   Changes In License Plates

   Over the years, license plates have undergone many changes. Originally,
   plates were made of steel and they were longer and narrower than modern
   plates. In addition, the colors varied with each reissue but usually
   were variations of gold (yellow), black, and blue.

   In the 1950's, the license plates began to look more like todays
   plates. They were slightly larger, and the year of issue was embossed
   in the upper corner. Today, the historical plates are highly sought
   after by collectors and automobile enthusiasts. DMV still allows the
   use of these plates on historical or antique vehicles.

   By the 1960's, license plates were becoming standardized throughout the
   nation. Most states, including California, had adopted the 6"x12" size
   as the universal standard for auto plates. Californias plates were
   still made of steel, but the metal validation tabs had been replaced by
   todays adhesive validation stickers. At first, Folsom printed the
   validation stickers, but this enterprise was later moved to the
   California Men's Colony.

   Many changes occurred during the 1970's and 1980's. Steel was abandoned
   in favor of aluminum because of its lighter weight and ability to be
   embossed or stamped with less pressure. The lighter weight translated
   to lower shipping and mailing costs.

   Up until this time, all license plates were dipped in huge vats of
   enamel paint after they were embossed to achieve the main color of the
   plate. This process was eliminated and replaced with pre-painted
   aluminum material. By the mid 1980's, enameled plates were no longer
   being manufactured. California joined a growing group of other states
   by switching to fully reflectorized license plates. Reflectorized
   license plates use unpainted aluminum covered by reflective sheeting
   prior to being embossed. Today, license plates can be manufactured
   using a variety of reflective sheeting backgrounds. Currently, PIA
   produces over sixteen different special license plate designs, with
   more on the way.

   Four-Step Process

   Even though the reflective backgrounds look different, all modern
   license plates are manufactured using four processes.

    1. The first step is the "blanking" process. Large coils of aluminum
       are fed through two machines in a row. The first machine applies
       the reflective sheeting to the aluminum. The next machine cuts the
       aluminum and sheeting into license plate blanks.
    2. The second step is the "embossing" process. Huge embossing presses
       emboss, or stamp, the design into the blank using moveable
       characters placed into a die.
    3. The third step is the "rollercoating" process. The embossed license
       plates are placed on a metal conveyor belt. The belt carries the
       plates under rubber rollers coated with blue ink, highlighting the
       embossed portions of the license plates. Once rollercoated, the
       plates go through a baking oven on a conveyor to dry the blue ink
       and cure the reflective sheeting.
    4. The fourth and final step in the production of license plates is
       the "packaging". The finished plates come out of the oven ready for
       packaging. Once the plates are inspected and approved, they are
       placed in envelopes, packed into cartons, loaded onto pallets and
       shipped to the warehouse for transport to DMV.

   Currently, PIA is only producing license plates for the State of
   California. However, PIA is able to produce license plates for other
   states or for foreign governments. Please contact PIAs Sales Branch at
   (916) 358-2733 for further information.
