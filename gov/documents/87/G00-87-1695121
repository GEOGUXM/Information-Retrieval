   inquiries. From the Tyler local calling area dial 590-1217. Outside the

   This is a service that allows any user with a personal computer or word
   processor to dial-in to bankruptcy court computers and retrieve
   official electronic case information and court dockets usually in less
   than a minute. Case document images are not available via PACER. In
   accordance with Judicial Conference policy, most courts charge a $.60
   per minute access fee for dial-up. Persons desiring to use this service

   National Party Case Index

   The U.S. Party/Case Index is a national index for U.S. district,
   bankruptcy, and appellate courts. This index allows searches to
   determine whether or not a party is involved in federal litigation
   almost anywhere in the nation. The U.S. Party/Case Index provides the
   capability to perform national or regional searches on party name and
   social security number in the bankruptcy index, party name and nature
   of suit in the civil index, and party name in the criminal and
   appellate indices. The search will provide a list of case numbers,
   filing locations and filing dates for those cases matching the search
   criteria. The U.S. Party/Case Index is available on the Internet and
   through the traditional dial-up service. The dial-up service is
   accessible with a terminal emulation of vt100 and settings of N/8/1.
   The toll-free modem number is (800) 974-8896 or (210) 301-6499 if
   residing in the San Antonio area. The Internet service is available on
   the World Wide Web at the U.S. Party/Case Index. For more information
   on the U.S. Party/Case Index, please visit the USPCI Overview.

   In accordance with Judicial Conference policy, the PACER Service Center
   charges a $.60 per minute access fee for dial-up service and $.07 per
   page for Internet service. Persons desiring to use this service must
   first register with the PACER Service Center at 1-800 676-6856 or on
   the Internet at http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/register.html.

   Federal Records Center

   The paper case file for all closed cases are eventually sent to the
   Federal Records Center in Fort Worth, Texas for long term storage. The
   policy differs slightly among our three divisional offices on how long
   a file is held at the divisional office after being closed.

   You are encouraged to always determine the physical location of a case
   file using the Court's electronic records before actually traveling to
   the Court. Please visit the FRC Search Page to determine if the case
   file you are interested in has actually been sent to the FRC for
   storage.
