   About NPOESS

      NPOESS merges U.S. polar-orbiting satellite programs previously
      operated by the Air Force and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
      Administration (NOAA). Established by Presidential Directive, NPOESS is
      a tri-agency program with NOAA, DoD, and NASA contributions. NPOESS
      will work in partnership with space agencies in Europe (EUMETSAT) and
      Japan (NASDA) and will leverage appropriate technologies from NASA
      programs to provide continuous global coverage of the Earth.

   Converging Programs

      NPOESS is initiating a program of convergence projects (sensors,
      concept demonstrations, and with NASA, the NPOESS Preparatory Project).
      In the future, NPOESS will carry out a broad program of satellite
      transition and sensor development. By converging U.S. satellite systems
      and partnering with EUMETSAT, NPOESS will reduce the number of
      polar-orbiting systems from four U.S. satellite groups to three (two
      U.S. and one European). The programmatic savings and benefits are
      manifold. The latest program information is available at the IPO.
