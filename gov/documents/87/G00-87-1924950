     NASAs Space Launch Initiative seeks next round of proposals from
     industry, academia in late March

     NASAs Space Launch Initiative is seeking its second round of
     proposals on technologies, experiments and other risk-reduction
     activities from industry and academia  taking another step toward
     making space launch safer and more affordable in the future.

     Technical proposals are due March 27.

     NASA expects to award multiple contracts totaling approximately $500
     million in September.

     The Space Launch Initiative (SLI), also known as the Second
     Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle Program, is a NASA technology
     development program designed to substantially improve safety and
     reliability of space travel, while reducing costs. The program 
     managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.,
     and supported by NASA Centers across the country  focuses on
     improving access to space for Americas 21^st century missions by
     increasing safety and reliability and reducing costs associated with
     a new generation of fully reusable launch vehicles.

      In spite of the advances in aerospace technology, human space
     flight remains a challenging endeavor, said Dennis Smith of the
     Marshall Center, manager of the Space Launch Initiative. We are
     asking industry and universities to develop concepts and leap-ahead
     technologies needed to pioneer safer, lower cost space flight. They
     have a clean sheet of paper and the competition is wide-open.

     This second round of requests targets research on propulsion, flight
     demonstrations and NASA-unique projects such as life support and
     crew safety, and integrated ground testing and simulations for a
     second-generation reusable launch vehicle. Space Launch Initiative
     management has identified these areas as critical to the program and
     in need of additional research.

     The Space Launch Initiatives first round of contract awards  valued
     at $791 million  went to 22 prime contractors. Those studies marked
     the first step of a process that will lead to development of a
     common set of alternative technologies that NASA will make available
     to all U.S. companies. These cutting-edge developments will be used
     for future government and commercial launch systems and space
     transportation operations.

     The Space Launch Initiative awarded an additional $94.6 million in
     December.

     "Proposals funded under this program will further define the
     technical requirements for achieving NASA's safety and mission
     goals, Smith said.  The proposals will initiate essential activities
     necessary to develop vehicles, ground support equipment and
     operations for a second generation reusable launch system."

     The original research announcement was issued in October 2000. NASA
     Research Announcement 8-30 Cycle I asked U.S. industry, educational
     institutions, nonprofit organizations and federal agencies to submit
     proposals in 10 areas: system engineering and architecture
     definition, airframe, vehicle subsystems, internal vehicle health
     monitoring, operations, upper stages, propulsion, flight mechanics,
     flight demonstrations and NASA-unique requirements such as life
     support and crew escape systems.

     The technology selected for development is based on extensive
     studies to assess the technological needs for a second-generation
     reusable launch vehicle. These technologies have been prioritized
     and the funding is commensurate with those priorities.

     The planned budget for the Space Launch Initiative totals $4.8
     billion through fiscal year 2006.

     The Space Launch Initiatives goal is to enable full-scale
     development of a reusable launch system in 2006  with flight
     operations anticipated in the 2012 timeframe.

     The Marshall Center is NASA's Lead Center for Space Transportation
     Systems Development. Marshall's efforts are supported by Ames
     Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif.; Stennis Space Center in
     Bay St. Louis, Miss.; Kennedy Space Center, Florida; Dryden Flight
     Research Center in Edwards, Calif.; Johnson Space Center in Houston;
     Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va.; the Jet Propulsion
     Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.; Glenn Research Center in Cleveland;
     and the Air Force Research Laboratory, which includes research and
     development facilities at nine United States Air Force bases
     nationwide.
