   Research Interests:

   Jian-Sheng Jiang's research is based on computational crystallographic
   methods and computing software in structural biology. He has worked
   with Prof. Axel Brunger at Yale University to develop X-PLOR/CNS
   software. He also has reviewed and processed thousands of protein
   structures for the Protein Data Bank (formerly at BNL). Recently, he
   began working in the human proteome project for high-throughput
   structure determination. He also is devoting part of his time to
   developing protein crystallography software at NSLS X-ray beamlines.

   Jiang is interested in developing crystallographic methods by combining
   experimental phasing (MAD and MIR) methods with direct methods,
   molecular replacement and density modification. He is developing a
   secondary structure motif database for supporting automation of
   structure determination and new software packages for high-through-put
   structures in structural genomics.


   [automation_logo.gif] The scope of this work is summarized on his
   Crystallographic Resources Web Site. This site also gives an account of
   the Workshop on Automation of Structure Determination which was held at
   Brookhaven Laboratory on June 20-21, 1999.
