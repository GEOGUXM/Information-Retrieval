   The M&D Database contains over 20,000 records of information related to
   impacts documented on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF)
   spacecraft, which spent ~5.7 years in Earth orbit. The database
   contains information on features documented at the Kennedy Space Center
   (KSC) during LDEF's deintegration in 1990, data generated at JSC over
   several years following LDEF's return, as well as data provided by
   various Principal Investigators from specific experiments.

   The on-line search offers the user the ability to search for impact
   feature information based on the LDEF Bay (A-H), Row (1-25*) location,
   Component Type (e.g., Frame, Experiment Tray, etc.), Substrate Material
   Type (e.g., Al, Teflon, etc.), and Feature Size (diameter in microns);
   the resulting data can be sorted by either Feature Number or Feature
   Size. Some searches may return a potentially large amount of data, and
   you may wish to limit your searches. For example, instead of searching
   all Rows and Bays at once, you may limit individual searches to include
   one Row at a time, or limit the feature sizes to different size ranges
   instead of including all feature sizes in a single search. If you want
   large amounts of data, you may wish to access the download menu to
   obtain complete or various partial data sets.

   The downloads offer the user the ability to download the entire
   database (i.e., 22,365 records), or one of several statistically
   significant sub-sets of the data. All downloads are TAB delimited ASCII
   files suitable for import into a spreadsheet or database application.
   Note that since the columns in these files are separated by TABS rather
   than spaces, the headers of each column of data will not appear to line
   up correctly when viewed on-line with your browser. However, when
   imported into a spreadsheet application, these values will align
   properly. For most browsers, these files may be saved to your hard
   drive by selecting "Save As..." from the browser's File menu.

   The three, downloadable sub-sets (i.e., Intercostals, the Space Debris
   Impact Experiment, &amp; the Chemistry of Micrometeoroids Experiment)
   contain the best, and most statistically significant and complete data
   sets from all of LDEF. These three data sets alone contain over 15,000
   impact records, or nearly 70% of the entire database, in a form that is
   ideally suited for use by interested parties.

   Specifically, the downloads available are:
     * Features Table - Contains every feature record in the database.
     * Primary Surfaces Table - Contains every record in the primary
       surfaces table of the database.
     * Intercostals - Contains feature information from the LDEF
       Intercostals (i.e., pieces of the structural frame), which were
       scanned in detail at JSC.
     * Space Debris Impact Experiment - Contains comprehensive feature
       information from selected surfaces of the S0001 experiment.
     * Chemistry of Micrometeoroids Experiment - Contains crater sizes and
       chemical classification^+ of projectiles from locations A03 &amp;
       A11. (Note: The classification and assignment of individual craters
       to specific projectile types is based on SEM-EDX analyses and
       interpretation by the experiment's Principal Investigator.)

   Access to and use of the data contained within the M&D Database is
   encouraged. As JSC will remain the central repository for such
   information, investigators are encouraged to continue to send similar
   data for inclusion with this extensive M&D Database. Investigators
   possessing such data should contact T.H. See (thsee@ems.jsc.nasa.gov)
   or M.E. Zolensky (mzolensk@ems.jsc.nasa.gov) at JSC to discuss details
   regarding the formatting and submission of the data for inclusion in
   the M&D Database. The Office of the Curator at JSC issues periodic
   updates on the state of the JSC holdings of LDEF, as well as other
   meteoroid-related activities, in the form of the Dust Courier. Parties
   interested in being added to the distribution list of this publication
   should contact M.E. Zolensky (mzolensk@ems.jsc.nasa.gov).
