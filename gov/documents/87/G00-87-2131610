  Computational Accelerator Physics Grand Challenge: Advanced Modeling for
                  Next-Generation Accelerator Applications

                                [rule13.gif]

  Introduction

   The Computational Accelerator Physics Grand Challenge is a
   DOE-supported collaboration involving national laboratories (Los Alamos
   National Laboratory and Stanford Linear Accelerator Center),
   universities (UCLA and Stanford), and high-end computing centers (the
   Advanced Computing Laboratory and the National Energy Research
   Scientific Computing Center). The goal of the Grand Challenge is the
   development and application of next-generation accelerator modeling
   tools based on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)
   technologies.
