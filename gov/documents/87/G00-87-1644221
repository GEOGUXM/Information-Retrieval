   On September 14, 2001, eleven WASC staff members participated in the
   annual King County Day of Caring, co-sponsored by the United Way and
   the Combined Federal Campaign.  This event brings over 7,000 volunteers
   together to participate in a broad range of projects to demonstrate our
   community's volunteer spirit and ability to make a difference in
   peoples' lives.  The WASC team spent a long hot day scraping paint and
   re-painting a gym at the Ruth Dykeman Children's Center.
