                    The California Board of Prison Terms



                             Executive Division

   The Executive Division includes the Chairman, the Board members, the
   Executive Officer and the Victim Services Coordinator. The Chairman is
   the administrative head of the Board and exercises all duties and
   functions necessary to ensure that the responsibilities of the Board
   are successfully discharged. He is the appointing authority for all
   civil service positions of employment in the Board, and has the
   authority to approve or disapprove applications from foreign born
   prisoners who wish to transfer to their countries of citizenship. The
   Board members travel throughout the state to conduct life prisoner
   parole hearings, and hold monthly Executive Board meetings. These
   monthly meetings include both a public session, to decide matters of
   general policy and transact business, and an executive session, to
   consider and make recommendations to the Governor or the courts
   regarding various clemency, parole suitability or re-sentencing
   matters. The Executive Officer, under the general direction of the
   Chairman, manages the day-to-day operation of the investigative,
   hearing, legal, and administrative functions of the Board.
