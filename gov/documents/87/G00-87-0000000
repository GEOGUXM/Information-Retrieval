   I am a quantum chemist in the SNL/CA High Performance Computing and
   Networking group. My research focuses on application and development of
   ab initio quantum chemistry methods.

Some Current Research Projects

     * Linear Scaling Coupled-Cluster Methods
     * The Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry (MPQC) Program
     * Characterization of the Sulfur Radical in the Ground Electronic
       State
     * Accurate Prediction of Heats of Formation for Various Tin Compounds

Some Previous Work

     * [diuracil.gif] We have recently completed a study of stacked uracil
       dimers, providing accurate predictions for structures and binding
       energies. These quantities were computed at the CCSD(T) and MP2
       levels of theory using very large high-quality basis sets with up
       to 2020 basis functions. The computations were carried out with our
       parallel program suite MPQC on the ASCI White computer at Lawrence
       Livermore National Laboratory.
