   Research and Special Programs Administration
                                               Jack Murray

   John P. Murray was named Deputy Administrator of the U.S. Department of
   Transportation's (DOT) Research and Special Programs Administration
   (RSPA) by Secretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater on October 24,
   2000. Mr. Murray entered DOT in May of 1998 as the White House Liaison
   and Special Assistant to the Secretary of Transportation. In May 1999,
   Mr. Murray was selected to serve as the Associate Administrator for
   RSPA's Office of Policy and Program Support. While continuing his
   position as Associate Administrator, Mr. Murray was named RSPA's Acting
   Deputy Administrator in November 1999.

   In his role as Deputy Administrator, Mr. Murray leads many of the
   agency's policy initiatives. He directs the Department's legislative
   and other activities related to pipeline safety issues and has led the
   development and filing of significant DOT pipeline safety rulemakings,
   such as the operator qualification rule, the definition of unusually
   sensitive areas, and the pipeline integrity management program.

   Mr. Murray contributed significantly to the success of Secretary
   Slater's Spirit of Innovation Conference in June 1999 at the John A.
   Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge,
   Massachusetts. The conference brought together leaders and officials
   from government, industry and academia to discuss the challenges facing
   the nation's transportation system in the new millennium.

   Mr. Murray also coordinated the Department's Crisis Management Center's
   monitoring and relief efforts during Hurricane Floyd and assisted in
   coordinating the Department's Y2K preparation and activities. He
   managed RSPA's efforts on Office of Hazardous Materials program
   evaluation, a significant DOT cross-agency effort to identify areas in
   need of improvement and to increase the efficiency of the federal
   hazardous materials safety program.

   Since 1993, Mr. Murray has served on special assignment to the White
   House in support of the President and First Lady on several
   international missions, including those to China, Mongolia, Africa,
   Russia, and Haiti.

   Prior to joining DOT, Mr. Murray spent seven years as an environmental
   consultant with the BSC Group in Boston, Massachusetts, where he
   managed environmental compliance and mitigation programs for portions
   of the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Federal Highway Project. He
   also served as Deputy Director of the City of Boston's Environment
   Department during former Mayor Raymond L. Flynn's administration.

   Mr. Murray has more than 17 years of managerial experience in
   government and the private sector with an emphasis on environmental
   planning, community development and government relations. He was born
   and raised in Boston and is a graduate of the University of
   Massachusetts.
