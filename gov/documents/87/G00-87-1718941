   Al Brown, Director

      The Environmental Services Department is responsible for the health and
         safety of the community. It is the Departments goal to prevent and
           remove environmental risks. The Departments Environmental Health
          Specialists are in the community every day making sure that food in
          more than 9000 eating and drinking establishments is protected from
         contamination, that measures are being taken to improve air quality,
       and that water supplies throughout the County are safe to drink. While
       there are a number of other services we provide, air quality is one of
           the most pressing issues talked about today. As a regional leader,
         Maricopa County has made major strides to improve the air quality by
          implementing various programs. We work hand-in-hand with the State,
      cities, towns and industry in the Valley to reduce air pollution. It is
         our belief that with continued support, future generations will reap
                                            the benefits of todays actions.
        Approximately 240 people staff the Department, which consists of five
               divisions: Air Quality, Business Services, Community Services,
                 Environmental Health Services, and Water & Waste Management.
            VISION STATEMENT: The Maricopa County Environmental Services will
        provide essential, regional environmental services seeking excellence
                                     in the most fiscally responsible manner.
            MISSION STATEMENT: To protect and improve quality of life through
                           responsive and effective environmental management.
