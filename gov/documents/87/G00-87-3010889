   As you know, New York City, Washington DC and Pennsylvania have
   suffered a tremendous loss as a result of horrific terrorist acts
   earlier last week. The Department of Health and Human Services
   Emergency Operations Center is coordinating US Public Health
   Service/National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) assets to respond to
   health and medical needs.

   OEP/NDMS is receiving a large influx of new applications.  These
   applications need to be sent to the team leader or administrative
   officer of the team closest to your area and not to OEP/NDMS.
   Unfortunately, at this time, we will be unable to forward applications
   to the appropriate team. If you would like more information about how
   to join a team or find the closest team to your area, please check out
   information about our teams or e-mail ndms@usa.net

   Thank you for your interest in NDMS and our response teams and hope
   that you will continue to send in your applications to the team leader
   or administrative officer of your local DMAT.  If you send in an
   application, please be patient because it will be many months before we
   are able to sort through, approve and process the numerous documents
   that we are receiving.
