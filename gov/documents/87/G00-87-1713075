                        WATERSHED SCIENCE FACT SHEETS

   The following Fact Sheets have been developed by the USDA's
   Agricultural Research Service to promote the ARS Watershed Research
   Program. The Fact Sheets identify broad issues, problems, and/or
   solutions that are of general public interest and that reflect research
   addressed by the ARS Watershed Research Program.

   The Fact Sheets are provided in ADOBE ACROBAT 4.0 . pdf format. They
   require ADOBE ACROBAT READER 4.0 for viewing. A free copy of the ADOBE
   ACROBAT READER can be obtained at www.adobe.com

   resolution: 1) low resolution (rapid display) is for general viewing
   and reading of text; and, 2) medium resolution (slower display) is for
