                             Spin-Trap DataBase
     __________________________________________________________________

   The STDB is a database of more than 10,000 records of published Spin
   Trapping experiments. This database includes the experimental results
   (e.g. hyperfine coupling constants) and journal reference information.

   Users may search the database using any combination of several fields
   of data such as Spin Trap Agent, radical molecule, solvent, text
   keywords, and hyperfine splittings of nuclei. The resulting data is
   linked to the journal reference information.

   Hints are available to help you use the STDB.

   Trusted users may add new data to the database. A separate database is
   maintained of usernames and passwords. Contact the system administrator
   who must edit this table to grant access to a trusted user.

   Please cite the database whenever you publish work that has made use of
   the STDB, whether internally or externally distributed. The original
   database was published as : "A Spin Trapping Database Implemented on
   the IBM PC/AT", Anson S.W. Li, Kiran B. Cummings, H. Peter RoethLing,
   Garry R. Buettner and Colin F. Chignell, Journal of Magnetic Resonance,
   vol. 79, pp.140-142 (1988). The database is available through internet
   at http://epr.niehs.nih.gov/.
