                        Mr. David Ferguson, Director


Of all the missions of the DCFL, providing professional and timely analysis
of media for our customers is our number one priority.  In order to focus our
limited resources on the most critical and sensitive matters, the laboratory
has created a triage system of case priorities.

The DCFL is currently accepting cases in all categories.
