                           National Examiner Board

   The National Examiner Board (NEB) was created to improve the designee
   program through innovation, oversight, and standardization. The NEB
   addresses designee issues, improves the quality of inspector
   involvement in the designee program, oversees the designee application
   and screening process, fosters a national designee organization and
   encourages designee participation in strengthening the national quality
   of aviation training.

   The NEB accepts and evaluates applications, FAA Form 8710-10, "National
   Examiner Board - Designated Pilot Examiner Candidate Application" for:
     * Designated Pilot Examiners (DPE)

   The DPE applicants are governed by the guidance in FAA Order 8710.3,
   "Pilot Examiner’s Handbook" and "Revision of Certain Prerequisite
   Eligibility Qualification Requirements for Designated Pilot Examiner
   Applicants (HBGA 99-03A)."

   The NEB accepts and evaluates applications, FAA Form 8110-28,
   "Application and Statement of Qualification (DME-DPRE-DAR-T") for:
     * Designated Mechanic Examiners (DME)
     * Designated Parachute Rigger Examiners (DPRE)
     * Designated Airworthiness Representatives-Maintenance (DAR-T)

   The DME applicants are governed by the guidance in FAA Order 8610.4,
   "Aviation Mechanic Examiner Handbook."
   The DPRE applicants are governed by the guidance in FAA Order8610.5,
   "The Parachute Rigger Examiner Handbook."
   The DAR-T applicants are governed by the guidance in FAA Order 8100.8,
   "Designee Management Handbook."

   Applications are available from your local FSDO or by downloading from
   this web page. Directions for mailing the application to the NEB are
   included the application package.

   The NEB will use the general qualification requirements, technical
   requirements, and experience criteria detailed in these orders for each
   type of designation, as applicable; to determine whether applicants
   meet FAA requirements for the initial designation sought.

   If an applicant’s qualifications meet the criteria for acceptance, the
   NEB will notify the applicant by letter and request that the applicant
   apply for a pre-designation knowledge test at a computerized test
   center. You must present the letter to the testing center proctor prior
   to taking the test. The proper designation to request when making an
   appointment at a testing center is PEA, Pilot Examiner Airplane; PEB,
   Pilot Examiner Balloon; PEG, Pilot Examiner Glider; PER, Pilot Examiner
   Rotorcraft; PEY Pilot Examiner Gyroplane; DME, Designated Mechanic
   Examiner; DPRE, Designated Parachute Rigger Examiner. A pre-designation
   test is not required for DAR-T.

   The applicant shall send the pre-designation test results to the NEB
   within 10 days of taking the test. The passing grade for this test is
   80%. If an applicant fails the test or chooses to retake the test to
   obtain a higher score, that applicant may retake the test 30 days after
   the date the last test was completed. The applicant’s name will be
   placed in the selection pool only after the NEB receives the written
   test report with a passing grade. Pre-designation written tests are
   valid for a period of 2 years.

   SEMINAR INFORMATION

   Any DPE applicant who has received a letter of acceptance from the NEB
   that acknowledges that applicant has met the basic eligibility
   qualification requirements of FAA Order 8710.3, may apply and attend
   the Initial pilot Examiner Standardization Seminar. Satisfactory
   completion of the course satisfies the designation requirement of FAA
   Order 8710.3. However, attendance at this course prior to designation
   will be strictly voluntary and no selection preference is implied.

   Any DAR-T applicant may attend an Initial Standardization Seminar
   without restrictions.

   Any DME, DPRE applicant who has received a letter of acceptance from
   the NEB that acknowledges that applicant has met the basic eligibility
   qualification requirements of FAA Order 8610.4 and FAA Order 8610.5
   will not be allowed to attend the Initial Designated Mechanic Examiner
   or Designated Parachute Rigger Examiner seminar until they have been
   selected by the FSDO.

   site.

   National Designated Pilot Examiner Registry (NDPER) Program. Designee
   applicants applying for designation under the provisions of the
   National Designated Pilot Examiner Registry (NDPER) Program will be
   screened by the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA). NDPER
   applicants will submit an application directly to the EAA for
   consideration. The EAA will recommend successful applicants to the
   appropriate Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) for further
   consideration. You may contact your local FSDO or the FAA's Great Lakes
   Flight Standards Regional Office, Technical Programs Branch, AGL-230,
   at (847) 294-7257 for additional information about the NDPER program.

   Examiners applying for special authorization to issue U.S. certificates
   on the basis of a foreign license under Title 14 of the Code of Federal
   Regulations (14 CFR) § 61.75 and/or to issue pilot certificates on the
   basis of military competency under 14 CFR § 61.73 will submit
   applications directly to the jurisdictional FSDO. This authorization
   will be issued only at the discretion of the designating FSDO or
   Regional Flight Standards Office, as appropriate. For additional
   authorization beyond issuance of the above certificates those
   applicants shall be treated as initial applicants and will be required
   to submit an application to the NEB for initial evaluation and
   recommendation.

   Examiners or DAR-Ts applying for reinstatement shall submit the
   completed application form directly to the Designating FSDO.
   Reinstatement shall be accomplished only by the FSDO who last had
   jurisdiction over the applicant. Former Designees who relocate to
   another FSDO and request reinstatement shall be treated as initial
   applicants and will be required to submit an application to the NEB for
   initial evaluation and recommendation.

   Examiners or DAR-Ts holding a valid and current certificate of
   designation who wish to relocate to a different geographical area,
   providing there is no break in service and the receiving FSDO agrees to
   the transfer, may do so without reapplying through the NEB.

   DAR-Ts requesting expansion of their delegation, holding a valid and
   current certificate of designation and who have previously gone through
   the NEB process only need to submit the technical portion of the
   application package along with FAA Form 8110-28. DAR-Ts who have not
   previously gone through the NEB will be required to submit a complete
   application package in accordance with FAA Order 8100.8A, Chapter 14.

   The NEB maintains files of applicants who are approved for the national
   designee candidate pool for a period of 2 years. If at the end of the
   2-year period the applicant has not been selected by a FSDO for
   designation, the applicant may re-apply. If the written test, which is
   also valid for 2 years as noted on the test report, has expired the
   applicant will be required to take the pre-designation written test to
   again be placed in the national candidate pool.

   You may submit updates of certificates, experience or other pertinent
   information at any time and request a re-evaluation by the NEB at the
   next quarterly meeting.

   The NEB shall keep applications from applicants who are not approved
   for the national examiner candidate pool on file for a period of 120
   days from the date of evaluation.
