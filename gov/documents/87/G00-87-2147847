   Notice of Amended Official Bankruptcy Forms Effective December 1, 2001
   The Judicial Conference has approved amendments to two Official
   Bankruptcy Forms. The forms that are amended are Official Form 1,
   Voluntary Petition, and Official Form 15, Order Confirming a Plan. Both
   amended forms will become effective December 1, 2001. Official Form 1,
   the Voluntary Petition, has been amended to require the debtor to
   disclose whether the debtor owns or has possession of any property that
   poses or is alleged to pose a threat of imminent and identifiable harm
   to public health or safety. If any such property exists, the debtor
   must complete and attach Exhibit "C" describing the property, its
   location, and the potential danger it poses. Exhibit "C" will alert the
   United States trustee and any person selected as trustee that immediate
   precautionary action may be necessary. Official Form 15, the Order
   Confirming a Plan, was amended to conform to amendments to Rule 3020 of
   the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure which are also expected to
   become effective December 1, 2001. Those amendments will require that,
   if the plan provides for an injunction against conduct not otherwise
   enjoined under the Bankruptcy Code, the order of confirmation shall
   describe in reasonable detail all acts enjoined, be specific regarding
   the injunction, and identify the entities subject to the injunction.
