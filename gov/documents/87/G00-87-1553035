   The Computer Science Research Institute(CSRI) brings university faculty
   and students to Sandia National Laboratories for focused collaborative
   research on DOE computer and computational science problems. The CSRI
   is organized under the DOE Stockpile Computing Program. CSRI provides a
   mechanism by which university researchers learn about problems in
   computer and computational science at DOE Laboratories. Participants
   conduct leading-edge research, interact with scientists and engineers
   at the laboratories and help transfer the results of their research to
   programs at the labs.
