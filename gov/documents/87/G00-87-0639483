   For Immediate Release
   REACTION TO THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
   Statement of Senator Chris Dodd

   January 29, 2002

   The President should be commended for his leadership in waging the war
   on terrorism, and for working to make homeland defense a top priority.
   Obviously, in this time of war, there can be no greater priorities, and
   our nation stands united behind the President. The Presidents warm
   reception before Congress reflects that.

   On the home front, Im pleased to see the President seek to address the
   ailing economy, but his prescription misses the mark. I supported a tax
   cut that was fiscally prudent, fair and equitable but frankly, under
   the Presidents watch, weve seen record surpluses vanish -- in large
   measure because of the huge tax cut that disproportionately benefitted
   top income earners. And to add insult to injury, the Presidents budget
   now raids the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds to pay for it.
   That can only further add unnecessary insecurity for our nations
   seniors. And while Im pleased to see the President offer limited
   assistance to seniors in the form of prescription drugs, Im
   disappointed he chose to only go with a band aid approach when it comes
   to reforming Medicare.

   I do think the President should get credit on a number of fronts, one
   of which is election reform. This is an issue I care deeply about, and
   his budget should be considered a good start to help ensure each
   Americans vote is counted. Im also pleased to see the President
   recognize that laid off workers desperately need unemployment
   assistance, and I commend him for extending those benefits.
