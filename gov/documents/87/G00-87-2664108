                  EXPORT CREDIT INSURANCE
     __________________________________________________________________

  Introduction

   The Export Credit Insurance program helps U.S. exporters develop and
   expand their overseas sales by protecting them against loss should a
   foreign buyer or other foreign debtor default for political or
   commercial reasons. With an Ex-Im Bank policy exporters can also obtain
   export financing more easily because, with prior approval by Ex-Im
   Bank, the proceeds of the policy can be assigned to a financial
   institution as collateral.

   To encourage the export of U.S. goods and services, Ex-Im Bank has
   tailored its policies to meet the insurance needs of exporters and
   financial institutions. For example, insurance policies may apply to
   shipments to one buyer or to many buyers, insure comprehensive
   (commercial and political) credit risks or only specific political
   risks, or cover short-term as well as medium-term sales. Three
   policies, the Small Business Policy, the Small Business Environmental
   Policy and the Umbrella Policy, are geared specifically to small
   businesses just beginning their export sales program. Eligibility
   criteria differ for each type of policy.

   Caution: Coverage against political risks only is limited and does not
   cover devaluation of a foreign currency as a risk of default. As the
   overwhelming majority of losses result from commercial default, the
   exporter should consider the appropriateness of obtaining a
   comprehensive (commercial and political risks coverage) policy. A
   political risks only policy is not subject to a first loss deductible.

   General Policies

   Reasonable Spread of Risk

   Under multi-buyer policies, exporters must in most cases insure all
   their eligible export credit sales. Sales on confirmed letters of
   credit or sales for cash in advance can be excluded. Shipments to
   subsidiaries and affiliates can only be covered for political risks or
   can be excluded entirely.

   U.S. Content Requirements

   Ex-Im Bank has a mandate to support the export sale and lease of goods
   and services of U.S. origin. The products sold must be produced or
   manufactured in the United States. For short-term sales, at least one
   half of the value (excluding price mark-up) must have been added by
   labor or material exclusively of U.S. origin. Goods must be shipped
   from the United States. No value may be added to the product by the
   insured after export from the United States. The table below shows the
   coverage available on medium-term exports with foreign content.
   Applicants must notify Ex-Im Bank in advance if any foreign content is
   to be included in an insured medium-term sale. Services must be
   performed by U.S.-based personnel or U.S. personnel temporarily
   assigned in the host country. Services may be performed in the United
   States or in the buyer's country.

   Coverage available on medium-term goods with foreign content:

                 Foreign Content               Coverage
                Up to 15 percent      All of the financed portion
            Between 16 and 50 percent      Only U.S. Content
              More than 50 percent       No coverage available

   Ex-Im Bank recognizes that there may be export opportunities which
   involve products that do not meet foreign content guidelines. Insurance
   agreements with certain foreign government Export Credit Agencies may
   enable Ex-Im Bank to provide support for such transactions. These
   transactions may involve content coming from Canada, Finland, France,
   Mexico, Sweden and Switzerland.

   Restrictions on Sales

   With specific exceptions, a policy may not provide insurance for goods
   or services destined for military use. Neither may a policy insure
   exports to or for use in a Marxist-Leninist country unless the
   President of the United States has determined that insured sales to
   that country are in the national interest.

   Country Limitation Schedule

   Economic and political conditions vary widely among nations. A Country
   Limitation Schedule has been established that details special
   conditions on short- and medium-term insurance covering the repayment
   risks on buyers in various countries. The schedule is updated when
   country risk perceptions change. To confirm current conditions for
   transactions in a particular country check the Country Limitation
   Schedule.

  Insurance Programs

   Types of Policies

   Ex-Im Bank offers a wide range of policies to accommodate many
   different export credit insurance needs:

   Policies for small business exporters
   , affording enhanced protection for short-term sales of smaller U.S.
   companies. Applicants must meet export sales volume criteria and must
   meet the U.S. Small Business Administration's guidelines for definition
   of a small business.

     Small Business Policy

     Umbrella Policy

   Multi-buyer policies, providing regular coverage for short-term export
   sales to many different buyers.

     Short Term Multibuyer Policy

   Single-buyer policies, insuring short, medium or combined short and
   medium term sales to one buyer.

     Short-Term Single-Buyer Policy

     Medium-Term Single-Buyer Policy

   Financial Institution Buyer Credit Policy, protecting financial
   institutions against losses on short-term direct credit loans or
   reimbursement loans to foreign entities for importing U.S. goods and
   services.

   Bank Letter of Credit Policy, protecting banks against losses on
   irrevocable letters of credit issued by foreign banks in support of
   U.S. exports.

     Bank Letter of Credit Policy

   Leasing policies, for operating and finance leases, insuring both the
   stream-of-lease payments and the fair market value of the leased
   product.

     Small Business Environmental Policy

     Leasing Policy

   Special policies, providing insurance on environmentally related goods
   and services, and insurance administered by trade associations.

     Insurance Special Policies

   The complete terms and conditions of the insurance are detailed in the
   policies themselves.

   Special Coverages

   Special coverages are also available under standard policies. Certain
   agricultural commodities may be covered at 98 percent of the commercial
   risk and 100 percent of the political risk (except when the equalized
   coverage option is selected, then coverage is 98 percent for both
   risks). Eligible products include grains, corn, raw sugar, sunflower
   seeds, rice, tallow, peanuts, cotton, cottonseeds, and the oils or meal
   derived from such products.

   Exporters can also obtain special endorsements to cover services, sales
   into or out of consignment, sales made from an overseas warehouse,
   nonacceptance of shipments, preshipment on a select or whole turnover
   basis, payments in a foreign currency, sales out of foreign trade
   fairs, used equipment sales and dairy/breeding cattle sales.

   Insurance Coverage

   Ex-Im Bank bases the terms and conditions of a multibuyer policy on the
   applicant's terms of sale, experience with export credit sales, its
   historical and anticipated export volume, foreign markets and the
   credit history of its buyers. Some policies may contain a Discretionary
   Credit Limit (DCL), which is an authorization to extend credit to a
   buyer, without prior approval from Ex-Im Bank, based on the needs and
   expertise of the insured. Buyers needing credit in excess of the
   insured's DCL authority may be covered under a policy through a Special
   Buyer Credit Limit (SBCL). Further, an SBCL for each buyer is necessary
   for a policy with no DCL or when the DCL is restricted by the Country
   Limitation Schedule. The SBCL covers a revolving line of credit to the
   buyer. After the insured receives payment for outstanding obligations,
   it may ship again to the buyer up to the SBCL amount within its terms
   and be insured. Insureds are responsible for supplying Ex-Im Bank with
   credit information that supports their credit judgments under a DCL and
   credit requests under a SBCL.

   Ex-Im Bank bases the terms and conditions of a single-buyer policy on
   the particulars of the insured's transaction(s) with the buyer.

   Exporter Retention and Deductible

   In general, policies cover 90 to 98 percent of the commercial risk and
   90 to 100 percent of specified political risks. In addition to
   retaining a percentage of the risk on each transaction, the exporter
   also may be required to absorb a first dollar loss, called the
   deductible, on losses that relate to transactions insured under a given
   policy. There is no first loss deductible for single-buyer or small
   business policies.

   Premiums

   Premiums for standard short-term comprehensive multibuyer policies vary
   with the credit terms, exporter experience, the quality and number of
   buyers being insured, and the importing countries. Most policies
   require a minimum premium to be paid in advance at the beginning of
   every policy year. Premiums for multi-buyer policies generally are paid
   monthly in tandem with submission of a report of shipments and premiums
   payable. Premiums for single-buyer policies are paid in advance of
   shipment. The premiums for small business policies come from a rate
   table based on repayment term and type of buyer. The premiums for
   medium-term policies are based on several factors: click on Exposure
   Fee Advice.

   Assignment

   With prior written approval of Ex-Im Bank, an exporter can assign its
   rights to the amounts payable under a policy to a financial institution
   to obtain financing.

   Insurance Brokers

   Insureds can designate an insurance broker to act as their agent in
   policy matters. Ex-Im Bank has established procedures for registering
   brokers. Brokers who wish to register should request an application
   from Ex-Im Bank.
