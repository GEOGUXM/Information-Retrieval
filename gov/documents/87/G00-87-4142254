                 Philadelphia Register of Wills

                 Mission
                 The Register of Wills is an elected official, one of whose functions is
   to determine whether a document offered for probate should be received
   as the last Will of the decedent. In situations where a Will does not
   name an executor, the Register determines who is authorized to
   administer the estate of the deceased.

   Wills are frequently challenged on the grounds of forgery, incompetence
   of the testator, or undue influence. The Register hears testimony with
   regard to any challenge and makes a decision accepting or rejecting the
   document offered.

   Where there is no Will, the Register grants Letters of Administration,
   usually to the next of kin. Where there is dispute among the heirs as
   to who should serve as Administrator, the Register will resolve this
   dispute.

   The current Register of Wills is the Honorable Ronald R. Donatucci.
