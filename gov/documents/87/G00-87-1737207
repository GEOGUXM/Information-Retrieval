   Department of Transportation, in cooperation with the GPS Joint Program
   Office (JPO), will provide information on the new civil signals being
   planned for the GPS L2 frequency (1227.60 MHz) and the new GPS L5
   (1176.45 MHz) frequency. The information presented will be important to
   those in the government and industry involved in the development,
   production, support or use of satellite navigation products and
   services for the civil and military users. No new GPS JPO procurements
   are being announced or are anticipated in the near term for this work.

   The agenda will be divided into a morning session (0900-1130) for the
   GPS Program overview and L2 and L5 overview presentations, and an
   afternoon session (1300-1600) for technical presentations on both new
   signals. The morning agenda includes: Overview of GPS Modernization
   Program; the New L2 Civil Signal; the New L5 Civil Signal and the GPS
   JPO Interface Control Document (ICD) Review and Approval Process. The
   afternoon agenda includes: Technical Description of the Planned L2
   Design; Laboratory Implementation of the New L2 Civil Signal; Technical
   Description of the Planned L5 Signal Design. Copies of the 16 April

   BACKGROUND: The Global Positioning System employs a constellation of 24
   satellites and associated ground stations to provide continuously
   transmitted world wide positioning, navigation, and timing signals for
   use with appropriately configured GPS user equipment. The current
   generation GPS space vehicles transmit signals at the L1 and L2
   frequencies. In the future, new civil signals will be transmitted on
   the L2 and L5 frequencies. The international civilian and military
   communities employ the dual use Global Positioning System.
