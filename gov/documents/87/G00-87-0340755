   for optical telescope at Table Mountain JPL has begun the development
   of optical communications capability for future deep-space mission
   support with the dedication of a new tele- scope laboratory at the
   Table Mountain Observatory near Wrightwood. A ground-breaking ceremony
   was held May 28 for the new Optical Communications Telescope
   Labor-atory, which signals NASA's expan- sion of its telecommunications
   capability to optical frequencies, accord- ing to Dr. Keith Wilson of
   the Optical Communications Group in the Communications Systems And
   Research Section 331. "As NASA aggressively pursues its solar system
   exploration strategy, telecommunications support of smaller spacecraft
   with more sophisticat- ed instruments will require the Deep Space
   Network to operate at higher frequencies and higher data rates," said
   Wilson, the new laboratory's telecommunications systems engineer.
   "Optical communications is a rapidly evolving telecommunications
   technology that supports high data rate communications in a small,
   low-power consumption and low-mass telecommunications package." The
   laboratory will house a 1-meter optical telescope that will support
   simultaneous transmission and reception with spacecraft from low-Earth
