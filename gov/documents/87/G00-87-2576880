                                                          January 22, 2002

    To:        The Honorable the Members of the Board of Regents

   From:    Rick Mills

   Subject: 2002-2003 Executive Budget Highlights

   The details of the 2002-2003 Executive Budget have just been released.
   The State faces a $6.8 billion deficit over a two-year period (current
   year through 2002-03).

   The Executive Budget proposes to close this large deficit through the
   use of "rainy day" reserve funds that have been set aside over the
   years for situations such as this; savings actions taken in the current
   year; additional savings through recommended program restructuring in
   2002-2003; and by maximizing the use of Federal revenues and further
   bond restructuring.

   The Executive Budget does not propose layoffs; however, there is a
   provision for an early retirement incentive program. The early
   retirement proposal stipulates that any position vacated through early
   retirement would be eliminated from the agency, but savings achieved
   through this plan would not accrue to the agency. Agency participation
   is voluntary. Please be advised that the State Education Department
   will not participate in this program.

   State Operations

   The 2002-2003 Executive Budget recommendations reflect an overall
   reduction of $19.7 million in General Fund State Operations funding for
   the State Education Department as follows:
     * A General Fund reduction of $18.9 million to reflect the transfer
       of the Office of Cultural Education to a newly created New York
       Institute for Cultural Education (NYICE) within the Council on the
       Arts. Funding for the NYICE would come from an increase in the
       surcharge of local records handling from $5 to $20. This transfer
       would be effective July 1, 2002. Interim funding (for the period
       April l through June 30, 2002) for the Office of Cultural Education
       would be provided by the Office of Professions revenue account.

     * The Executive recommends a General Fund savings of $1.2 million to
       be achieved through the merger of the Office of Higher Education
       and the Office of the Professions. The proposal eliminates the
       Regents responsibility for academic program reviews and the funding
       for the SED staff that currently conduct these reviews. The twelve
       staff for which there would no longer be funding would be moved to
       other areas of the Department.

     * The Executive Budget recommends an additional $400,000 for
       administration of the Building Aid program within State Aid.

   The Regents and I will work together with you to ensure that all of our
   program functions continue as part of the State Education Department.

       recommended, resulting in a $20 million school year level
       reduction)

   programs:
     * Charter School Development ($6 million)
     * Civility, Citizenship and Character Education ($.5 million)
     * Charter School Stimulus Account ($20 million)

   The Executive Budget recommends additional funding for the following

       of $15.65 million)
     * Non-public Mandated Services Aid (an additional $4.6 million for a
       total of $70 million)

   Capital Projects
     * $1.695 million - clean and repair the Education BuildingÂ’s north
       wing exterior.
     * $.295 million - copper pipe replacement in the Cultural Education
       Center.
     * $5 million - renovation projects to preserve and revamp the
       collections and exhibits of the Museum, Library and Archives (These
       funds are available only as matching funds for equal amounts raised
       for capital projects from non-governmental sources).
     * $.9 million - minor rehabilitation projects.
     * $.175 million - State School for the Deaf security improvements.
     * $1.7 million - State School for the Blind security improvements,
       classroom enhancements, restroom compliance and outdoor
       enhancement.

   detailed description of the Executive's State Aid Proposal.  We will
   send you the more detailed tables in the near future.
