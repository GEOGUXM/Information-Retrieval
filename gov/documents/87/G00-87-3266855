   The Air Resources Laboratory conducts research on processes that relate
   to air quality, climate, and emergency preparedness, concentrating on
   the transport, dispersion, transformation and removal of trace gases
   and aerosols, and the exchange between the atmosphere and biological
   and non-biological surfaces.
