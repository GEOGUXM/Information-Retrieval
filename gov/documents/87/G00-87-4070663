      The Hubble Space Telescope orbits far above the distorting effects of
      the atmosphere, about 600 Kilometers above the Earth. This perch gives
      astronomers with their clearest view ever, but it also prevents them
      from looking directly through the telescope. Instead, astronomers use
      Hubble's scientific instruments as their electronic eyes.

      These instruments include cameras and spectrographs. Hubble's cameras
      do not use film; they collect light with electronic detectors similar
      to those in home video cameras. The spectrographs separate starlight
      into a rainbow of colors, just as a prism splits sunlight. By carefully
      studying the colors, astronomers can decode a star's temperature,
      motion, composition and age.

      Hubble uses mirrors to focus and magnify light. Its 8-foot-diameter
      main mirror is tucked inside a long, hollow tube that blocks the glare
      from the Sun, Earth, and Moon. Wing-like solar panels collect sunlight
      and convert it into electricity.

      Radio antennas allow Hubble to communicate with its flight controllers
      at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Controllers send
      detailed instructions several times a day. This information is
      converted into a code that the spacecraft's main computer can
      understand.

      Imagine pointing a laser on a dime 200 miles away, and holding it
      steady for hours or days. This is the precision of Hubble's
      sophisticated pointing control system. Once Hubble locks onto an
      object, its sensors check for movement 40 times a second. If movement
      occurs, constantly spinning wheels change speeds to smoothly bring the
      telescope back into position.

      As Hubble observes celestial targets, its computers turn the
      information into long strings of numbers. This digital data travels as
      radio signals to a communications satellite, which beams the
      information to Goddard. From there, it travels by landline to the Space
      Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md., where is turned back
      into pictures and astronomical data.

      Hubble's daily downloads are stored on optical computer disks, which
      provide a unique resource for current and future astronomers. The
      observations from a single day would fill an encyclopedia.
