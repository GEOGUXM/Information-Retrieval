                           About the Icing Branch

   The Icing Branch at NASA Glenn Research Center performs research
   activities related to the development of methods for evaluating and
   simulating the growth of ice on aircraft surfaces, the effects that ice
   may have on the behavior of aircraft in flight, and the behavior of ice
   protection & detection systems.
   The Branch is part of the Research and Technology Directorate and works
   closely with the staff of the Icing Research Tunnel and the Twin Otter
   Icing Research Aircraft.
