   NISN Overview

   The NASA Integrated Services Network (NISN) is the result of the
   consolidation of the management responsibility for the various NASA
   wide area telecommunications networks under a single organization.
   These networks were formerly known as:
     * PSCN - Program Support Communications Network
     * Nascom - NASA Communications Network
     * NI - NASA Internet (formerly NSI - NASA Science Internet)
     * AEROnet- Aeronautics Network
     * EBnet - Earth Observation Data Information System (EOSDIS) Backbone
       Network

   The Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Information Services Division
   (ISD) has been delegated the responsibility for all wide area
   networking within NASA. In partnership with Goddard Space Flight Center
   (GSFC), a team and organization has been established to address Agency
   WAN issues such as:
     * Changes to service offerings of the existing networks
     * Moving to the use of commercial services where appropriate
     * Integration of requirements gathering and customer support
     * Enterprise funding of services
