   General

   Why was this project needed?
     * As he traveled around the country, Health Resources and Services
       Administration (HRSA) Administrator, Claude Earl Fox, M.D., M.P.H.,
       was asked "Can you help my community obtain the data we need to
       assess health, plan programs, and develop data-based health
       policy?" Information to communities became a HRSA priority.
     * HRSA produces a State profile, which has been published on the Web;
       asks local areas to designate health professional shortage areas;
       funds community and migrant health centers; and administers a
       number of programs designed to improve health care to all (e.g.,
       "100% Access, 0% Health Disparities). The Community Health Status
       Indicators (CHSI) Project provides data for these activities to
       local areas.

   What was the process used in designing the CHSI Report?
     * A Project Team consisting of the Association of State and
       Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), the National Association of
       County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), and the Public Health
       Foundation (PHF) has guided the CHSI Project since the Spring of
       1998. See Attachment A.
     * The CHSI Project Team reviewed existing indicator reports,
       including State efforts to provide information to local areas,
       state-of-the-art work in presentation of data for community use,
       and gaps in information reported by communities.
     * An Advisory Committee comprised of State and local health
       department representatives, academia, and representatives of
       Federal level initiatives supportive of local health data reporting
       provided advice to the Project throughout. See Attachment A.
     * During the 2-year development period, the Project Team maintained
       contact with representatives of other major data and health
       assessment initiatives, including:

     * Leading Health Indicators Project, the Institute of Medicine
       Committee
     * Rural Public Health Infrastructure Project, National Advisory
       Committee on Rural Health
     * Office of Minority Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human
       Services
     * Healthy People 2010, Office of Disease Prevention and Health
       Promotion
     * Chronic Disease Indicators, Council for State and Territorial
       Health Officials
     * Sentinel Health Departments, Public Health Practice Program Office
       (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

   What was the major goal of the CHSI Project?
     * It was learned during the feasibility period that communities
       wanted a health status report which:

     * would be presented in a "new, engaging format,"
     * contained a broad range of health indicators, and
     * allowed comparison of one county to another.

   Who was involved in the design of the CHSI Report?
     * Advice was obtained from the CHSI Advisory Committee made up of
       Federal, State, local, and academic representatives; liaisons; and
       CHSI staff. See Attachment A.
     * Advisory Committee members were consulted as to 1) local health
       departments’ needs, 2) local health agency needs as seen by State
       health departments, and 3) the state-of-the-art in presenting local
       data.
     * Focus groups of local health departments were conducted to learn if
       the template would meet their needs. Feedback included the
       discovery that:

     * peers would be unique and intriguing to local areas, and
     * interest in the reports might be wider than originally planned and
       could include community residents interested in health.

   How was the CHSI Report dissemination strategy developed?
     * A Data Release Task Force provided a strategy for release of the
       printed reports and launch of the Web site. See Attachment A.
     * The Data Release Task Force recommended that health officials be
       allowed to preview their county results prior to public release on
       July 24. Around July 1, paper copies or CD ROMs of the CHSI Reports
       were mailed to health officials.
     * In addition to the CHSI Report itself, the following materials were
       provided to assist health officials with understanding and
       interpreting their health reports:

     * "Ideas for Using the CHSI Report in Your Community"
     * "A Guide to Writing a Press Release for Your CHSI Health Status
       Report"
     * "Community Health Status Report: Data Sources, Definitions, and
       Notes"
     * "Frequently Asked Questions"

   How were the CHSI Project indicators selected?
     * The CHSI Project Team reviewed the indicators most often used and
       needed by local public health practitioners. Some indicator
       selection efforts include the Committee 22.1’s report in the
       Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, MAPP’s (Mobilizing for
       Action through Planning and Partnerships: A Strategic Approach to
       Community Health Improvement) core indicators, and the Institute of
       Medicine’s community health improvement and leading health
       indicator reports.
     * Being a national project, the CHSI Project Team decided that only
       measures for which data existed for every U.S. county would be used
       in the CHSI Report. Indicators that may be available locally or
       only in some States are noted in the CHSI Report, but no data are
       presented.
     * The CHSI Project Team kept itself informed of national
       data/indicator initiatives to ensure consistency of measures. A
       list of such people and organizations is found in Attachment A. For
       example, Healthy People 2010 specifications for selected objectives
       were used on pages 6-7 of the CHSI Report. In another example of
       coordination, environmental health indicators were guided by the
       NACCHO environmental indicator survey results (soon to be published
       in Protocol for Assessing Community Excellence in Environmental
       Health) and the tool, Mobilizing for Action through Planning and
       Partnerships: A Strategic Approach to Community Health Improvement
       (to be released in 2000).

   Why were counties used as the reporting unit?
     * Most national data sets define geographic units by political
       boundaries. Noting that HRSA’s Area Resource File has a long
       history of using county and county aggregate units, the CHSI
       Project adopted counties as the unit of measure.

       The basic county-specific Area Resource File (ARF) is the nucleus
       of the overall ARF System. It is a database containing more than
       6,000 variables for each of the nation's counties. ARF contains
       information on health facilities, health professions, measures of
       resource scarcity, health status, economic activity, health
       training programs, and socioeconomic and geographic codes and
       descriptors… The ARF System is comprised of data from more than 50
       different source files…
       The file is routinely expanded to incorporate additional data
       requested by the community of ARF users. Data on the basic file
       fall into the following eight categories:
          + Codes and Classifications
          + Health Professions
          + Health Facilities
          + Utilization
          + Expenditures
          + Population Characteristics and Economic Data
          + Environment
          + Health Professions Training (http://www.hrsa.gov/bhpr/arf.htm)

     * While local health agency boundaries are most useful for local
       public health system planning, barriers to providing data for these
       geographic units included the absence of a boundary file for local
       health jurisdictions. Counties could be aggregated or
       disaggregated, but no definitive file of the most advantageous
       grouping of jurisdictions was available.
     * The unit of assessment will be reconsidered when the next CHSI
       Report is developed.


   What were the methods for selecting peer counties?
     * We learned from local health department focus groups that their
       most important criteria in selecting peers was population size,
       density, and poverty status.
     * The Project Team, with advice from its Advisory Committee, sought a
       process which would give the Project strata of 20-50 counties;
       strata separated by frontier and non-frontier; and when numbers
       allowed, further characterized by poverty and age distribution. The
       complete set of factors and cut points is reported in the
       "Community Health Status Report: Data Sources, Definitions, and
       Notes."
     * An algorithm is posted on the CHSI Web site that diagrams the peer
       groupings.

   Why did CHSI choose to provide estimates for some counties and not
   others?
     * The CHSI Project goal was to provide as many timely, stable
       indicators as possible for every county.
     * To do this, the Project has aggregated information over 3-, 5-, and
       10-year periods to allow larger numbers of events to be used in the
       calculations of county rates.

                                                                         5

                                                                   <25,000

                                                                        10

                                                                         5

     * For births, counties must meet the criteria of 500 or more births
       and 3 or more events. The minimum number of deaths reported was 10.
       See "Community Health Status Report: Data Sources, Definitions, and
       Notes."
     * Even with aggregation over time, some jurisdictions still had too
       few numbers ("nrf") to report a stable rate for their county.
     * Some indicators were not reported for every year over the time
       period reported. They are designated by a "nnn."

   How can I get a copy of my county’s CHSI Report?
     * County CHSI Reports may be downloaded and printed from
       www.communityhealth.hrsa.gov on the Web after July 24, 2000.

   After an introductory page, you’ll be asked to select the county whose
   data you wish to see or print. Using the State name, county name, or
   characteristics of counties (e.g., race/ethnicity, size, peers), you
   can select the county to view. You than have the option of downloading
   or printing the CHSI Report.

   How can I add my own data to my county’s report on the Web site?
     * HRSA has developed a process that allows the health official(s)
       responsible for a county to provide contact information and
       supplemental local data to the CHSI Web site. This information will
       be compiled and provided as an addendum to your county CHSI Report
       on the CHSI Web site at www.communityhealth.hrsa.gov.
     * In the URL box of your Web browser, enter:
       www.communityhealth.hrsa.gov/addendum. After accessing this URL,
       instructions for providing county-specific information will appear.
       You will use your NACCHO ID number, which is printed on your
       mailing label. If you need assistance, please contact Anjum Hajat
       at NACCHO at ahajat@naccho.org or (202) 783-5550.
     * Please do not share your NACCHO ID with others. We would like the
       data on the addendum page to be accurate and reliable.

     * Please complete information for all required fields. Submissions
       with incomplete required fields will not be accepted. Contact
       information for the submitter is a required field.

   General - Numbers

   The number in the CHSI Report is not the number my State has given me…
   or that I calculated. How could this be?
     * It could be due to having different numbers that quantify either
       the population or the number of events.
     * A different age adjustment standard (year 2000 versus the more
       traditional 1940 U.S. population) could have been used, resulting
       in different rates.
     * Estimates may be calculated a number of ways.

   How can I prepare for discussion about the health indicators found in
   the CHSI Report for my county?
     * Read the CHSI Report. Write a press release, talking points, and
       hold "grand rounds" for your local area.
     * Link CHSI Report findings to local activities or findings.
     * Add specific locally derived numbers by following the instructions
       found at www.communityhealth.hrsa.gov/addendum.

   Why didn’t my county get a specific rate reported?
     * The rates and percents are presented in the CHSI Report only when
       they meet the criteria of having 500 births and 3 events (births
       and infant mortality) or 10 deaths (mortality) during the reporting
       period. We grouped up to 10 years of information to ensure that
       counties received recent and stable information for their counties.

   How do I know that the numbers used are not too variable, that the
   rates observed are not due to chance?
     * The rates and percents, which are based on small numbers described
       above, will vary from one time period to another, and from one half
       to twice the rate observed even when the rate or percent is
       actually constant. We did not calculate trends for this report.
     * Small areas with sparse populations will have the problem of
       variable rates and percents. Looking at the data another way may
       help—examine the annual rates for the past 5 years, and if each
       year is higher than the comparison (e.g., U.S. rate), the
       information on the single, multiple year rate is confirmed.

   Can I obtain the raw data for my county?
     * The raw data behind the reports will not be made available, but
       most likely can be obtained by contacting the data collectors—State
       or local health departments. Note that the exact number of cases
       and populations may differ between the CHSI Report and the local
       source because of different information sources.

   Why is my county’s overall mortality much higher in the CHSI Report
   than from other sources?
     * Age-adjustment to the year 2000 standard (as used in the CHSI
       Report) gives more weight to older populations. The older age
       groups have higher mortality for most causes of death. For most
       communities, homicides and HIV/AIDS are exceptions.
     * One must not compare year 2000 age-adjusted rates to U.S. 1940 or
       other decade standard-adjusted rates. Age-adjustment allows
       comparison between rates that are age-adjusted to the same
       standard.

   Why did the CHSI Report give out small numbers? Isn’t confidentiality
   an issue?
     * The CHSI Report aggregates at least 3 years of data together and
       does not report any personal identifier except county of residence.
     * We have followed guidelines established by the Council of State and
       Territorial Health Officials and the Centers for Disease Control
       and Prevention, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.


   General - the CHSI Report

   Can I copy and disseminate the CHSI Report?
     * Yes, print it from the PDF document provided on the Web, photocopy,
       and assemble local booklets.

   Where can I get data sources and definitions used in the CHSI Report?
     * Each local and State health department was mailed the "Community
       Health Status Report: Data Sources, Definitions, and Notes." This
       type of information is found in that document, including ICD-9
       codes, methods used for certain calculations, and resources such as
       Web sites and data sources.
     * This document is also posted on the Web, at
       www.communityhealth.hrsa.gov.

   How can I answer the question from my community, "What needs to be done
   to improve our health indicators?"
     * First, identify and celebrate positive health indicators. Then
       build on community interest to start discussions about a health
       improvement process for health status areas that are poor relative
       to "peer" counties or the Nation. Just as you can help other
       counties with your successful model programs, you should also look
       to peer counties for assistance in areas where they excel. This is
       a time to share ideas and work together on similar challenges, and
       to involve community residents in the process.
     * For communities with a health improvement process underway, the
       CHSI Report offers a chance to restate findings and priorities, to
       compare local findings to the national snapshot provided by the
       CHSI Report, or to use the CHSI Report as a baseline for the next
       decade. Identification of data gaps may also be helpful.
     * Most communities will want to pursue additional information
       indicated in the report (e.g., childhood immunizations), or
       explanatory and supplemental information (e.g., insurance coverage
       or where high risk babies are born). Draw on the knowledge base of
       prevention. Ask "What factors contribute to poor outcomes in this
       indicator?" Pursue additional, local information.

   General - States

   Why did the CHSI Project develop local reports when States already have
   data for the counties?
     * Some States have data; others do not.
     * The CHSI goal was to create a health profile in a "new, engaging
       format."
     * Comparisons to peers are not available from States.
     * Applications of new tools were used (e.g., "Relative Health
       Importance Table").

   Page 2/3 - Peers

   Why is my city grouped with the county? Why is the State of Alaska
   treated as a county? Why were counties grouped together?
     * We used the county codes developed and used for years in the HRSA
       Area Resource File. There is ongoing discussion about whether these
       are optimal.
     * When the next CHSI Report is issued, consideration will be given to
       the geographic regions used, whether city data can be provided, and
       if some counties should be grouped together. The CHSI Project Team
       welcomes your comments via the CHSI Web site.

   What if I don’t agree with the peers selected? What can I do?
     * Examine the demographic criteria used to define your strata.
     * Look up a county that you feel is like yours and make your own
       comparisons.


   Page 4 - Summary Measures of Health

   Why are these called summary measures?
     * These allow the community to assess whether their residents are not
       only living longer but are also healthier (Goal 1 of Healthy People
       2010).
     * It is often useful to use one number to simply convey a community’s
       health.
     * Each number, however, will convey slightly different information.

   Page 5 - Leading Causes of Death

   Why doesn’t the CHSI Report provide American Indian and Asian/Pacific
   Islander in addition to Black race in the Leading Causes of Death?
     * We chose a solution which was less complex and which met the needs
       of most communities.
     * The next CHSI Report may provide data for other races.
     * This table, for some communities, will have blanks due to few
       events occurring among population subgroups. Your comments on
       presenting information about how sub-populations may differ on a
       variety of health outcomes are welcome.

   Page 9 - Vulnerable Populations

   From where did the estimates of vulnerable populations come?
     * There is no one source that provides timely estimates of all
       vulnerable populations. No single methodology has been applied to
       derive estimates for all these vulnerable populations. The formulas
       have been derived in a variety of ways.
     * In most instances, percentage has been applied to the current
       population.

     * Multivariate estimates of local prevalence (work disability)
     * National, regional, or age/race-specific survey estimates (drug
       abuse, depression)
     * National surveys (unemployed)
     * Actual Census prevalence (no high school diploma)

     * The sources are provided in the "Community Health Status Report:
       Data Sources, Definitions, and Notes" document mailed with

   How were the estimates for the uninsured derived?
     * There is no one source that provides timely estimates for special
       populations. No one methodology has been applied to derive
       estimates for these vulnerable populations.
     * The estimated county percentage of uninsured has been applied to
       the current population. The prevalence of uninsured individuals was
       derived from a multivariate estimate using unemployment rate. The
       exact formula used is documented in the "Community Health Status
       Report: Data Sources, Definitions, and Notes," which has been
       mailed to local health agencies and is found on the Web at
       www.communityhealth.hrsa.gov.

   Why won't links work from the CHSI reports to the companion document,
   or from the companion document to the stratification document?
     * All CHSI documents are in PDF format, designed to be viewed and
       printed using the Adobe Acrobat Reader. Acrobat Reader can be used
       independently, or as a "plugin" to your web browser. The links in
       the CHSI documents will only work properly when Acrobat is used as
       a plugin. If you are using Netscape, but the documents are being
       opened in a separate Window in Acrobat Reader, you must copy the
       plugin file to the Netscape environment. Using Windows Explorer,
       find the file "nppdf32.dll" in the Adobe Acrobat "Browser" folder,
       and copy it to the Netscape "Plugins" folder.
       Although your computer configuration may differ, you will most
       likely copy "nppdf32.dll" from the Acrobat folder to the Netscape
       folder typed below:
          + From Acrobat:    C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat
            4.0\Acrobat\Browser
          + To Netscape:      C:\Program
            Files\Netscape\Communicator\Program\Plugins
       After copying the file, exit Netscape and re-open it.
       If Acrobat Reader is not installed on your system, or you would
       like to upgrade to version 4, click the image below:

   Can I link directly to the county information from my own website?
     * Yes. The pages that display the summary information for each county
       are "dynamically generated" (that is, they are created from a
       database and do not exist as discrete files), so you need to know
       the State and county FIPS codes in order to create the links.

     * The CHSI Web server expects to be told which county has been
       requested by means of a "parameter" (a piece of information
       supplied with the request). The name of the parameter is
       CountyList, and the expected format is SS,CCC where
       SS = the State FIPS code, and
       CCC = the County FIPS code.
       To use this information, you create a hyperlink in your web page
       that contains the basic URL (http://www.communityhealth.hrsa.gov)
       and the name of the script (countyinfo.asp), followed by the
       question mark and the parameter information (?CountyList=SS,CCC).
       DO NOT PUT ANY SPACES INTO THE HYPERLINK! Enclose the entire URL in
       double quotes.
       The complete request in your web page should look like this:
       <a
       href="http://www.communityhealth.hrsa.gov/countyinfo.asp?CountyList
       =SS,CCC">My County, My State</a>
       Don't forget to replace the SS and CCC with the appropriate FIPS
       codes for the State and county to which you want to link.
