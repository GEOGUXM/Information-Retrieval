       I am a Ph.D. astronomer whose primary field is Solar physics. This
       involves software development, analysis of scientific satellite
       data, and science satellite operations. I have over 15 years
       experience in astrophysics, over 10 years working on space
       satellite operations, and 5 years devoted to solar physics.

  January 1996
   to
  Present

              Emergent Information Technologies, Inc. (Previously known as SM &A
              Corp., Space Applications Corp. and Applied Research Corp.)
              SOHO EIT Senior Scientist

     Support operations, data reduction, and data analysis for the Extreme
   ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on the NASA/ESA SOHO spacecraft.
   Operations includes real-time planning of observations and evaluation
   of instrument health and safety.

     A significant amount of time is spent in supporting EIT programming
   needs. Code was developed in support of three main areas; database
   access, image processing and analysis, and instrument calibration.

     Instrument calibration work consists of a relative and absolute
   calibration. The relative calibration is part of an ongoing SOHO Guest
   Investigator proposal while the latter is proceeding through
   inter-instrument comparisons.

     Work has been completed on the first generation Universal Solar
   Coronal Flux Calculator. This promising technique uses EIT data to
   compute Differential Emission Measures.

     SOHO's success in arousing public interest in science has resulted in
   a number of additional responsibilities for SOHO scientists. I have
   participated in public education through tours and the Dr. SOHO online
   program.

     Proposal work was performed on two proposals, the CSOC and SSDOO,
   unrelated to task work. While neither of these proposals were won,
   valuable experience was gained.

   Program. The SPoC has overall responsibility for software,
   documentation, and operation of the Guest Investigator Facility and
   reporting to the NASA COBE Guest Investigator Program manager.

     Developed GUI interfaces as well as core analysis software.

     A significant part of the SPoC task was assisting visiting Guest
   Investigators in their scientific analysis as well as coordinating
   their visits.
