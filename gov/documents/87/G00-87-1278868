   The HOU Middle School Curriculum, Hands-On Solar System (HOSS), lets
   your students use images from professional telescopes along with image
   processing software developed for use in the classroom, to learn key
   concepts in astronomy, mathematics, and technology. HOSS blends content
   learning with critical thinking skills and processes such as data
   interpretation, measurement techniques, and using appropriate tools for
   exploration.

   You may download non-printing versions of the HOSS books for free from
   our HOU Middle School Curriculum Download Page. Feel free to review the
   materials.

   If you decide you would like to explore the possibility of
   incorporating these materials in your classroom, you will need the HOU
   Image Processing software (on CD-ROM) and may purchase a copy through
   the HOU Order Page. Cost of the CD-ROM is $15 for individual copy, $150
   for site license for you school's computer lab.

   You may also purchase from us class sets of paper print versions of the
   Student Books and Lab Books from the HOU Order Page as well.

Summary of HOU Middle School Curriculum

   Introduction: What's Out There? (CLASSROOM) Students brainstorm a list
   in answer to the question, "What types of things do we find in the
   night sky?"
    1. Our Closest Neighborãthe Moon
          + A. The Image Processor (COMPUTER LAB) -- Students learn how to
            use the HOU Image Processing software while exploring
            characteristics of craters on the Moon. Image Processor
            functions: Open, Zoom, Pixels, Coordinates, Brightness
            (TERC/LHS)
          + B. Crater Game (CLASSROOM) -- In this game, student get
            practice using their Image Processing software to determine
            diameters of craters.
          + C. Moon Measure (COMPUTER LAB) -- Students measure the
            diameter of a crater and its circumference using Image
            Processing tools.
          + D. Model Craters (CLASSROOM) To really see more of how craters
            appear, students make model Moon craters and see how the
            pattern of shadows associated with craters is affected by the
            angle of sunlight shining on them. Optional: Cratering
            ExperimentsãStudents toss meteoroids (pebbles) into basins
            offlour to simulate crater formation.
          + E. Moon Phases (CLASSROOM) With the Moon being a white
            polystyrene ball and the Sun being a bright light at the
            center of the room . Each students¼ head is the Earth.
            Students can also observe and record the real phases of the
            Moon over a period of a couple of weeks.
    2. Comets (COMPUTER LAB)
          + A. False Color Comet (COMPUTER LAB) -- Students learn the
            Image Processor functions: Min-max, color palette
          + B. Comet Set -- Earth's rotation (CLASSROOM) -- Students learn
            that because Earth is a spinning planet, when we watch the
            sky, it looks like objects in the sky change position.
          + C. Comet motion (CLASSROOM) -- Students learn how, since a
            comet is in orbit around the Sun, it appears to move with
            respect to background stars. Optional activity: ellipse
            drawingãthe shapes of orbits.
          + D. Modeling CCD Image Capture (CLASSROOM) -- Students create a
            model for how a CCD camera on a telescope is used to collect
            image information in terms of number of photons of light
            captured in each pixel of the image. Photons are modeled as
            Styrofoam peanuts and pixels are represented as cups.
    3. Asteroids (COMPUTER LAB) Students learn how asteroids can be
       discovered by comparing two images of the same place in the sky.
       They also learn the difference between an asteroid and a comet.
    4. Planets
          + A. Jupiter's Moons (COMPUTER LAB) -- Students measure the
            radius of the orbits of some of Jupiter's moons.
          + B. Jupiter Rotation (Hoette) -- Students see evidence of
            rotation of Jupiter by observing the Great Red Spot.
          + C. What Is It? How Far Is It? (COMPUTER LAB) -- Students
            review (or learn) all the types of bodies in the solar system.
            They arrange the planets in order and record planet sizes and
            distances to the Sun. For this part, students use the HOU
            "What Is It? How Far Is It?" web pages--"Nearby Objects."
          + D. Planet Sizes (COMPUTER LAB) -- The solar system web pages
            have all distance and size data EXCEPT for a 5 conspicuously
            missing planet sizes (Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, Mars, Uranus).
            To find those planet sizes, students must use their Image
            Processing software to determine first the planet size in
            pixels, and then compute the planet size in kilometers, once
            they are given the pixel scale size (e.g. for Jupiter image 1
            pixel = 2200 km)
          + E. Moons of Uranus and Neptune (COMPUTER LAB) -- Students use
            proportion and/or algebra to calculate the orbit radius of a
            moon.

                   HOU Middle School Curriculum Materials
                           and National Standards

   HOU embraces the inquiry-based approach to learning outlined in the NRC
   National Science Education Standards which state that in grades 5-8
   students should develop the ability to:
          + Clarify questions and inquiries and direct them toward objects
            and phenomena that can be described, explained, or predicted
            by scientific investigation.
          + Formulate questions, design investigations, execute
            investigations, interpret data, use evidence to generate
            explanations, propose alternative explanations, and critique
            explanations and procedures.
          + Use appropriate tools and techniques to gather, analyze, and
            interpret data.
          + Communicate scientific procedures and explanations.

   Content-wi se, the HOU middle school curriculum pays heed to NRC
   National Science Education Content Standards for Earth and Space
   Science (CONTENT STANDARD D) which states that
   "A major goal of science in the middle grades is for students to
   develop an understanding of earth and the solar system as a set of
   closely coupled systems."

   Specific elements of the Content Standards in Earth and Space Science
   are
          + The earth is the third planet from the sun in a system that
            includes the moon, the sun, eight other planets and their
            moons, and smaller objects, such as asteroids and comets. The
            sun, an average star, is the central and largest body in the
            solar system.[See Unifying Concepts and Processes]
          + Most objects in the solar system are in regular and
            predictable motion. Those motions explain such phenomena as
            the day, the year, phases of the moon, and eclipses.
          + Gravity is the force that keeps planets in orbit around the
            sun and governs the rest of the motion in the solar system.
            Gravity alone holds us to the earth's surface and explains the
            phenomena of the tides.
          + The sun is the major source of energy for phenomena on the
            earth's surface, such as growth of plants, winds, ocean
            currents, and the water cycle. Seasons result from variations
            in the amount of the sun's energy hitting the surface, due to
            the tilt of the earth's rotation on its axis and the length of
            the day.

   The National Standards also include in Science and Technology (CONTENT
   STANDARD E):
   "Science and technology are reciprocal. Science helps drive technology,
   as it addresses questions that demand more sophisticated instruments
   and provides principles for better instrumentation and technique.
   Technology is essential to science, because it provides instruments and
   techniques that enable observations of objects and phenomena that are
   otherwise unobservable due to factors such as quantity, distance,
   location, size, and speed. Technology also provides tools for
   investigations, inquiry, and analysis."
