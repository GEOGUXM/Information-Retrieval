      The Glovebox Program offers Principal Investigators the opportunity to
      conduct Microgravity Science investigations in the areas of combustion
      science, fluid physics, fundamental physics, materials science, and
      biotechnology.

      A Glovebox is an enclosed volume that provides physical isolation of an
      experiment from its environment and enables crewmember manipulation of
      experiment hardware through gloveports. The Microgravity Glovebox
      (MGBX) has been the platform for conducting numerous experiments in
      Spacelab, in the Shuttle Middeck, and in the Priroda module on the
      Russian Space Station Mir. A larger Glovebox, the Microgravity Science
      Glovebox (MSG), with enhanced capabilities is currently being developed
      for use in the U.S. Laboratory on the International Space Station.

      In general, Glovebox investigations (or experiments) are smaller-scale,
      less complex, less automated, more crew intensive, and utilize fewer
      diagnostics than the typical larger-scale spaceflight experiments. As
      such, Glovebox investigation hardware can be developed within two to
      three years at a fraction of the cost of most larger-scale experiments.
      Since 1992, the Glenn Research Center has developed and successfully
      flown over twenty-five Microgravity Glovebox investigations in the
      areas of combustion science and fluid physics.
