   Terra Weekly Mission Status Update

   January 10 - January 16, 2002

   Mission Systems
   Investigation continued this week into the source of a network anomaly
   that has periodically affected the ability of the EOS Operations Center
   (EOC) to send commands and receive telemetry from the Terra spacecraft.
   On January 17, 2002, while new cables were being installed and
   connected to the facility's network routers, it was noted that the
   backup router had a bad processor card. The processor card has been
   replaced and the network continues to be monitored for further
   anomalies. This successfully completed the first of a two-part
   modification.

   The EOSDIS Core System Flight Operations Team participated in a dry run
   of the Aqua spacecraft compatibility interface test #4 (SCIF-4) on
   January 14. The dry run successfully exercised AIRS B-side operations
   and clock correlation procedures; other portions of the dry run were
   impacted by configuration issues at the spacecraft manufacturer's
   facility. The "run for the record" execution of SCIF-4 is currently
   scheduled for February 1, 2002.

   The EOS Data and Operations System (EDOS) has successfully completed
   processing a recent spate of reprocessing orders for the ASTER Science
   Team. This brings the EDOS reprocessing backlog back to zero hours.

   Terra
   The Terra spacecraft is operating in nominal mode. All instruments are
   currently functioning well in nominal science mode.

   The schedule for Drag Make-up Maneuvers required modification based
   upon the decision to postpone the Inclination Adjust Burn, as the
   thrust component of this burn would have contributed to drag make-up.
   The already scheduled long-duration TDRSS passes planned for support of
   the Inclination Adjust Burn were used to execute a 14-second Drag
   Make-up Maneuver at 10:39 EST on the morning of Wednesday, January 16.
   Drag Make-up Maneuvers are much shorter and less complex than
   Inclination Burns, as no attitude changes or significant instrument
   reconfigurations are required. Therefore, the maneuver was deemed safe
   and not susceptible to major impact by the sporadic network events. As
   a safety precaution, Terra Flight Operations Team personnel were
   stationed in the backup EOC to take over operational responsibility in
   the event of any problems. There were no network issues during the
   maneuver.

   Planning continued to initiate a series of 2-day tests using Terra to
   simulate the Aqua science data load on the Polar Ground Network. The
   first test is scheduled for February 4, 2002, and 2-day tests will
   continue at roughly 16-day intervals (i.e., the Terra ground track
   repeat cycle).

   Several MDA2BITE trips (High Gain Antenna Motor Drive Assembly
   opto-coupler Single Event Upsets) occurred during this reporting
   period, with no resultant non-recoverable data loss.

   Plans
     * Initiation of re-planning for the next Terra Inclination Adjust
       Maneuver
     * Commercial Ground Site Validation will continue once the DataLynx
       antenna is declared operational (expected February 1, 2002)
     * MODIS calibration roll maneuver (early February)
