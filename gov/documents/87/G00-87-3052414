        Operations Development Group Responsibilities

        The Operations Development Group is responsible for the operations
        engineering of the MSFC managed payloads and flight systems. The
        primary task is to ensure the operability of the design and prepare for
        and execute flight operations. The results being that the payloads and
        flight systems operate in an effective and efficient manner with other
        onboard systems, ground systems, and the flight crew and has all the
        necessary features to meet mission and science operations objectives.
