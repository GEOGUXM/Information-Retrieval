                             Regulatory Revision

   The Legal Unit is actively involved in a comprehensive revision of the
   Board's regulations to make them consistent with recent statutory
   changes and court decisions. The anticipated result will not only be
   current, but "user friendly."

   The regulations for all state agencies are now available through the
   Office of Administrative Law's website. Board of Prison Terms
   regulations are at title 15, division 2, sections 2000-2999.
