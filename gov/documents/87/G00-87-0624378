                          Postdoc Opportunities in T-4

   The Atomic and Optical Theory Group (T-4) at Los Alamos National
   Laboratory welcomes postdoctoral applications from candidates who have
   received their Ph.D in the last 3 years. Areas of interest include:
     * Atomic and cluster behavior in hot, dense, ionized media
     * Interaction of intense electromagnetic radiation with atoms
     * Atomic and molecular opacities
     * Excitation and ionization of atoms and molecules by photon,
       electron, and ion impact
     * LTE and non-LTE models of physical systems
     * Diagnostic synthesis of experimental spectra
     * Quantum and nonlinear optics
     * Applications using vector, parallel, and microcomputer environments

   Computational experience is highly desirable.

   For initial consideration, interested candidates should send their
   resumés to T-4 Postdoctoral Position, MS B212, Los Alamos National
   Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545. The formal application requires
   resumé, employment application form, three external letters of
   reference, a one page research proposal (written by the candidate after
   discussion with his or her sponsor), and graduate and undergraduate
   transcripts.

   Further information about qualifications, benefits, and application
   procedures for the LANL postdoctoral program may be found at the LANL
   Postdoc Opportunities page.
