   Cancer death rates are decreasing in the United States. This is due
   partly to the success of patient studies - clinical trials or clinical
   studies - that over the years have developed better prevention,
   diagnosis, and treatment methods for many different cancers, including
   breast cancer, colorectal cancer, childhood cancers, Hodgkin's disease,
   and testicular cancer. Today, thousands of researchers and patients
   throughout the United States are involved in clinical trials to
   continue development of better technologies in the prevention,
   diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. These trials encompass studies of
   cancers in virtually every anatomical site and every stage of disease.

   Clinical Trials: General Information
   [cleardot.gif]
   [cleardot.gif]
   Clinical trial is a term that refers to research studies with people.
   These trials, also referred to as clinical studies, are designed to
   show how a particular anti-cancer strategy affects the people who
   receive it. These studies are the final step in the process of
   developing new drugs and other means to prevent or fight disease. Once
   a drug has shown promise, first in laboratory and then in animal
   studies, it may move on to studies with people if the Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA) approves. At this stage, FDA approval is to
   conduct the study - not approval of the drug itself. Only after a drug
   proves to be safe and effective in clinical studies does the FDA grant
   approval for marketing the drug.

   Locations of Clinical Trials
   [cleardot.gif]
   [cleardot.gif]
   Clinical trials take place in cancer centers, other major medical
   centers, community hospitals in many cities and towns across the United
   States. Large networks called cooperative clinical trial groups, which
   are funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), carry out hundreds
   of clinical studies. The researchers and oncologists who belong to
   these networks conduct joint studies at the same time in many different
   places and pool their data.

   Clinical Trials Process
   [cleardot.gif]
   [cleardot.gif]
   A clinical trial begins with the chief investigator of the study, who
   is generally a doctor, preparing a plan called a protocol. The protocol
   explains what the trial will do, how, and why. It states:

     How many people will be in the study

     What study drugs or methods participants will take or use

     What medical tests they will have and how often

     What information will be gathered

     What specific characteristics people should have to participate in
   the study (eligibility criteria). These criteria may include the type
   of disease and its stage, the patient's age, and general health.

   Every research center that takes part in the trial uses the same
   protocol. This ensures that information from all centers can be
   combined and compared.

   Benefits and Advantages of Clinical Trials Participation
   [cleardot.gif]
   [cleardot.gif]
     One advantage is the possibility that a new treatment, diagnostic
   test, or preventive measure will turn out to be better than currently
   prescribed procedures.

     A patient will receive health care and be closely monitored by
   leading physicians in the field of cancer research.

     If the approach being studied is found to be helpful, the patient
   may be among the first to benefit.

     Many cancer patients have said that they take part in studies
   because it is an opportunity to contribute to new knowledge that may
   benefit others with cancer.

   Potential Risks
   [cleardot.gif]
   [cleardot.gif]
     New drugs and procedures may have unknown risks or side effects as
   well as hoped-for benefits.

     Side effects and results may be worse than with interventions that
   are currently standard.

     Even if a new approach has benefits, it may not work for some
   patients.

     Health insurers and managed care providers do not always cover all
   the care costs in a clinical trial.

   Discussions with a doctor, nurse, family, and friends, combined with
   knowledge from cancer information sources, will help a person make
   better decisions about healthcare options - including clinical trials.

   To find out more about clinical studies:

     Call NCI's Cancer Information Service (CIS) at 1-800-4-CANCER
   (1-800-426-6237) and ask for a customized search of the PDQ database
   that provides information on current studies.

     Log on to CancerTrials at to receive additional information on
   cancer trials, as well as other resource options.

     Contact an NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center to learn about clinical
   trials. Assistance in locating one of these centers can be obtained by
   calling the CIS at 1-800-4-CANCER or via
   http://www.nci.nih.gov/cancercenters/.

     Read NCI's easy-to-understand brochures about clinical trials
   designed for cancer patients and their families, including:


     Taking Part in Clinical Trials: What Cancer Patients Need to Know
     Taking Part in Clinical Trials: Cancer Prevention Studies.

   Call the NCI's CIS at 1-800-4-CANCER to request a free copy or download
   it from the cancerTrials Web site.

     Contact patient advocacy and voluntary organizations that may have
   information on studies of specific cancers. Some cancer patient
   organizations are now preparing succinct, non-technical summaries of
   clinical trials in conjunction with NCI. Many of these summaries are
   now available via the homepages of these organizations and their
   newsletters. [endmark.gif]
