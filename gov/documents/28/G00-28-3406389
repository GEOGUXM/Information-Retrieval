   HST Project Update

   All operations at KSC in support of SM3A have been completed. The final
   truck was packed at KSC on January 31, 2000. The Orbital Replacement
   Unit Carrier (ORUC) and Flight Support System (FSS) were successfully
   transported via C-5 aircraft from Cape Canaveral Air Station skid strip
   to Andrews Air Force Base and then moved via ground transportation to
   GSFC on January 31, 2000. The ORUC and FSS have been removed from the
   Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO) container and are being prepared to be
   moved into the cleanroom.
