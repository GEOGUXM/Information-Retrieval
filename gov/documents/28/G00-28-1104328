      In 1984, the National Academy of Sciences recommended initiation of a
      Global Tropospheric Chemistry Program (GTCP) in recognition of the
      central role of tropospheric chemistry in global change. Envisioned as
      the US national component of an international research effort, the GTCP
      entails the systematic study, supported by numerical modeling, of (1)
      biological sources of atmospheric chemicals; (2) global distributions
      and long-range transport of chemical species; and (3) reactions in the
      troposphere that lead to the conversion, redistribution, and removal of
      atmospheric chemicals. The GTCP is currently part of a comprehensive
      international research effort coordinated through the International
      Global Atmospheric Chemistry Programme (IGAC), which is a core project
      of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP). NASA's
      contribution to the GTCP is the Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE)
