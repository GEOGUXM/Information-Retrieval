   Under the leadership of Dave Gurule, Area Manager, our office is
   charged to manage, direct and assist in all aspects of administering
   contracts for the Los Alamos National Laboratory and with the County of
   Los Alamos. We are committed to doing this through dialogue and
   cooperative partnerships with surrounding communities, tribal, federal
   and state governments.
   Some of the issues we are involved with affect your lives. By listening
   to your concerns, we believe we can make better decisions.
   By considering each other's concerns and interests, we can make better
   decisions regarding our community.
   We focus our work and organization on the principles of people, safety,
   environment and fiscal responsibility. People are our most important
   resource and we will always place lives and the individual first. We
   place high priority on the protection of public health and safety. We
   take responsibility for the quality of the environment, recognize the
   impacts of our operations and strive for waste reduction and
   elimination. As stewards of the "taxpayers' money," we attempt to get
   the more productivity for the dollar and seek improvement and
   efficiency to save costs.
   We want to hear from you.
