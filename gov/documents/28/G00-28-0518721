      WARNER ISSUES STATEMENT ON LAW SCHOOL SHOOTINGS

                             Printer Friendly Version

      Washington, DC Today, U.S. Senator John Warner expressed deep regret
      for the loss of life and concern for those wounded in shootings at
      Appalachian School of Law in Grundy, Virginia.

      As our newest law school, it is a dream come true for so many and
      sparks pride among residents throughout Southwest Virginia.

      I join with the community in expressing profound sorrow for those most
      immediately touched by the loss of life and wounding of other victims,
      and I commend the courage of those who intervened to prevent further
      violence by restraining the assailant.

      Justice must be done, consistent with the law and the Constitution.
