   I work in the Linac Group in the Proton Source Department in the
   Accelerator Division at Fermilab. Wish to learn more about Fermilab
   Accelerator Complex?
   I have private web page where I keep stuff not related with my work.i

     Papers

   I have written more than 70 papers, which are available through this
   link. You can have a copy of my current curriculum vitae.

     Mashines

   This is 750KeV line Injection to Drift Tube Linac

   These are Linac pictures

   These are drawings and photos of the end of Fermilab Linac and 400 MeV
   transfer line.
     * End of High Energy Linac drawing photo
     * 400MeV Beam Line to Booster drawing photo
     * Linac 400MeV Diag. Line drawing photo

       These are pictures related with 200MHz Test Station
       These are viewgraph of my recent talks related with
       Accelerators/Physics
       These is what I am doing for last couple days for living
