   Geochemical activity of microorganisms in the Earths biosphere
     * Comparable to the production of organic matter during
       photosynthesis

     * Greatly exceeds that of the whole human population

     * CO[2]: fossil fuel combustion~5 x 10^9 ton/year

       microbial decomposition of plant residues ~5 x 10^10 ton/year

     * CH[4]:6-8 x 10^8 ton/year arrives in atmosphere,

       of which 60-80% is of microbial origin

     * SO[x]:fuel combustion and sulfide ore smelting~ 10^8 ton S /year

       sulfate reduction in oceans ~4 x 10^8 ton of reduced S /year

   BIOLOGICAL MARKERS

   BIOGENIC GASES:
     * Biogenic gas detection: CH[4], C[2]H[6], N[2]O, NH[3], CO[2],
       H[2]S, etc

     * Discriminate against non-biogenic sources and sinks

   ISOTOPIC RATIOS:
     * Lifes catalysts (enzymes) preferentially use lighter isotopes
       during metabolism: interested in N, C, S, and O biogeochemical
       cycles

     * e.g. ^13C/^12C of organic C is 2-4% lower than that of inorganic C
       (carbonates) because organisms preferentially fix ^12C during
       organic biosynthesis.

     * Iron-reducing bacteria (that produce ferrous iron) have different
       isotopic composition to abiological terrestrial iron.

     * Early Earths rock record shows onset of sulfate reduction and the
       divergence of the isotopic compositions of sulfates and sulfides
       through ^34S/^32S.

   MOLECULAR CHIRALITY:
     * Chirality: amino acids, building blocks to proteins. Life on Earth
       based on left-handed L-amino acids (non-terrestrial could be L- or
       D-, but not both).

   Fundamental modeling questions
     * Are chemical species produced by potential Martian life forms
       distinct from atmospheric constituents resulting from abiogenic
       processes?

     * Given source fluxes from putative Martian life community, or sink
       fluxes consumed by an active life community:

     * what are the consequent constraints for detection strategies?
     * what is the impact on atmospheric composition?


   Unique biologically-derived atmospheric constituents
     * Expand successful model of Martian atmosphere abiogenic
       photochemical composition to include biological compounds

     * Compare speciation of abiogenic atmosphere with atmospheric
       products and derivative species of potential life forms

     * Identify potentially unique signatures of biological activity

    Atmospheric composition with prescribed biogenic sources & sinks
     * Define surface sources/sinks for a putative life community

     * Compute perturbation of atmospheric abundances resulting from
       surface sources/sinks on various spatial scales in 1D, 2D, and 3D
       atmospheric models

     * Define required sensitivities for detection strategies

   A strategy for identifying chemical signatures
     * a broad search for minor, disequilibrium constituents

     * a directed search for specific gases

     * an investigation of anomalous isotope ratios

   Laboratory measurements
     * Low temperature mass spectrometry (Eiler Group)
     Study the relative fractionation of H, C, N, and O compounds at
       temp<273 K.

     * Mass spectrometry and laser pyrolysis (Chutjian Group)

     interfaces to either GCs or laser/thermal pyrolysis oven

     * Tunable laser spectroscopy (Webster Group)

     Study the sensitivity limitations to measuring isotopic ratios.

     Measurement of production and release of biogenic gases in microbial
       mats
