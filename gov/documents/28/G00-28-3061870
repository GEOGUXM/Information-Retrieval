         The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary--A Special Place


   Sanctuary waters are filled with life! A variety of unique habitats are
   waiting to be explored, each harboring a spectacular array of plants
   and animals. Discover the thrill of diving lush kelp forests, rocky
   reefs, shale beds or sandy seafloors. National marine sanctuaries are
   special places--coastal and undersea counterparts to our national parks
   that are protected for their biological

   diversity or cultural significance. The largest and deepest of the
   nation's 13 marine sanctuaries, Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary
   spans 5,322 square miles of ocean, stretching along 300 miles of
   coastline. At its deepest point, the sanctuary reaches more than two
   miles below the surface in the Monterey Canyon.

   The primary role of a marine sanctuary is to protect its natural and
   cultural features while allowing people to use and enjoy the ocean in a
   sustainable way. To protect its natural wonders, activities that could
   harm the health of the sanctuary, like oil drilling or ocean dumping,
   are prohibited. The sanctuary also facilitates many uses, such as
   fishing, diving and boating.

   Help Protect the Sanctuary

   To make your dives more enjoyable and safe, and to help protect this
   national treasure, please:

   Sharpen your skills. Master the basic skills of diving (particularly
   buoyancy) well enough to be completely at ease. You'll be safer and
   enjoy more of what you're seeing.

   Plan your dive well. Diving these waters is challenging. You may want
   to hire a local divemaster or instructor to accompany you on your first
   dives. Know the unique characteristics of a dive site in advance, so
   that you don't become disoriented or lost. Before you dive, designate
   entry and exit points as well as contingency exit points in case
   conditions change unexpectedly. For specific dive site information,
   consult dive stores, charts or local divers.

   Control your buoyancy. Mastering buoyancy control means your dives will
   be safer and less strenuous.

   Streamline your equipment. Keeping gear close to your body reduces drag
   and the chances of entanglement. It is also helpful to tape down your
   fin straps. Sea life is everywhere and can be harmed by the kick of a
   fin, bump of a tank, or knock of the hand.

   Learn the proper techniques for diving in kelp. Always swim below the
   surface (kelp canopy) and navigate with your compass. If you must swim
   over the canopy, carefully push the kelp down and slowly dog paddle
   across. Don't panic or thrash around if entangled in kelp. Slowly
   remove the kelp, or have your buddy gently untangle it for you.

   Keep a safe distance from marine mammals. To prevent disturbing harbor
   seals, California sea lions, sea otters or other marine mammals, stay
   50 to 100 yards away from them. If they look in your direction and
   fidget, it's time to back away.

   Avoid touching or taking anything. Your slightest touch can disturb
   marine life. Removing rock or shell for the sake of a souvenir can
   disrupt this fragile system.

   Get Involved

   Divers are privileged to witness the diversity and abundance of marine
   life in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Share the wonder
   and promote responsible ocean stewardship by getting involved in some
   of these activities:

    Join a dive club or conservation group that promotes education and
   conservation.

    Try your hand at photography or videography, and use your undersea
   images to inspire others to learn more about the ocean.

   Keep yourself informed about ocean issues. Be an advocate for
   responsible ocean management by making your voice known to management
   authorities or elected officials.

    Take part in fish counts or underwater surveys that can help
   scientists and fisheries managers better understand changes in the
   marine ecosystem.

    Participate in beach or underwater clean-ups.
