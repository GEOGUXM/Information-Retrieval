      From the Summer 2001 Newsletter:

      President Bush sent clear signals to the Federal workforce that
      performance is the centerpiece of his policies regarding human
      resources issues and Government reform. Performance is the Centerpiece

      workforce planning and restructuring, human resources flexibilities,
      and sets the focus of the President`s Management Council.

      Managers can play an important role in setting the stage for good
      performers. Formula for Maximizing Performance explains how certain
      factors contribute to performance and how managers can focus on those
      factors to improve the results their employees and organizations
