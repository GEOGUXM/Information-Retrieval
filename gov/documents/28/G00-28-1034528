   Background

   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) "Missouri River Master Water
   Control Manual" (Master Manual) review has resulted in consideration of
   many flow alternatives for managing the water in the river (COE, 2001;
   1998a). The purpose of this report is to present flow-management
   alternative model results in a way that can be easily visualized and
   understood. This report was updated in October 2001 to focus on the
   specific flow-management alternatives presented by the COE in the
   "Master Manual Revised Draft Environmental Impact Statement" (RDEIS;
   COE, 2001).  The original version (February 2000) is available by
   clicking here.

   The COE, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Missouri River states,
   and Missouri River basin tribes have been participating in discussions
   concerning water management of the Missouri River mainstem reservoir
   system (MRMRS), the Missouri River Bank Stabilization and Navigation
   Project, and the Kansas River reservoir system since 1986. These
   discussions include general input to the revision of the Master Manual
   as well as formal consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered
   Species Act. In 2000, the FWS issued a Biological Opinion that
   prescribed changes to reservoir management on the Missouri River that
   were believed to be necessary to preclude jeopardy to three endangered
   species, the pallid sturgeon, piping plover, and interior least tern
   (USFWS, 2000).

   The combined Missouri River system is large and complex, including many
   reservoirs, control structures, and free-flowing reaches extending over
   a broad region. The ability to assess future impacts of altered
   management scenarios necessarily involves complex, computational models
   that attempt to integrate physical, chemical, biological, and economic
   effects. Graphical visualization of the model output is intended to
   improve understanding of the differences among flow-management
   alternatives.

   Scope

   This report presents a visual, statistical presentation of five modeled
   flow-management alternatives and two reference alternatives for four
   selected sites on the Lower Missouri River at Sioux City, Iowa,
   Nebraska City, Nebraska, Kansas City, Missouri, and Boonville, Missouri
   (fig. 1). The flow-management alternative data have been generated by
   the COE using the Missouri River system Daily Routing Model (COE,
   1998b). The Daily Routing Model calculates a water balance and routes
   water through six dams in the system, providing modeled outflows at 14
   sites.

   Flow-management alternatives presented in this report are limited to
   those under consideration in the August 2001 Master Manual RDEIS (COE,
   2001) and two reference alternatives, the Current Water Control Plan
   (CWCP) and a run of river scenario (ROR), explained in "Modeled
   Alternatives."
   Figure 1. Missouri River map of streamgages used in flow visualization
   Figure 1.  Missouri River basin and the Lower Missouri River. The Lower
   Missouri River is the part of the river downstream of Gavins Point Dam
   near Yankton, South Dakota, and extending to the junction with the
   Mississippi river near St. Louis. Flow-management alternative data are
   presented here for streamgages at Sioux City, Nebraska City, Kansas
   City, and Boonville.

   Selection of MRMRS water-control rules is a complex and ongoing
   socio-economic and political process that attempts to balance desires
   of multiple stakeholders in the Missouri River basin. Flows modeled in
   each of the alternatives can be evaluated in terms of economic benefits
   and relative environmental effects; results of these effects models are
   presented elsewhere (COE, 1994-1999; COE, 1998a, RDEIS; COE, 2001.)
   This report presents modeled streamflows to enhance visualization and
   understanding of proposed flow-management alternatives for the Master
   Manual; it does not attempt to evaluate relative performance, benefits,
   or environmental effects of alternatives.

   Daily Routing Model

   Results of flow-management alternatives have been modeled by the COE
   using the Daily Routing Model (COE, 1998b).  The modeled flows are
   synthesized from historical data on tributary inflows, calculations of
   streamflow depletions due to evapotranspiration and consumptive use of
   water, and modifications of outflows according to water-control rules
   that comprise a flow-management alternative. The model reproduces how
   reservoirs would be managed under a set of water control rules, given
   the actual range of variability of historical inflow data.  Historical
   data are available, or have been estimated, for the period 1898-1998.
   The Daily Routing Model uses these data and water-control rules to
   generate 100 years of daily flows for each of 14 sites for each
   flow-management alternative. The 14 sites consist of nine streamflow
   gaging stations on the Lower Missouri River and five streamflow gaging
   sites in inter-reservoir river segments. Model runs show the result of
   highly variable streamflow routed through the reservoir system
   according to water-control rules of varying complexity. Because storage
   in the Missouri River reservoir system is finite and because many
   tributary inflows are not regulated by reservoirs, the natural
   variability of the historical inputs is reflected in variability in the
   output discharge (fig. 2). Additional information on the Daily Routing
   Model can be found in COE (1998b).
   Figure 2. Flow diagram of daily routing model
    Methods

   Modeled flow data for the alternatives were obtained from the COE.
   These files consist of dates and modeled flows at nine streamflow
   gaging stations on the Lower Missouri River. Of these nine sites, four
   were chosen to represent the range of effects on the Lower Missouri
   River (fig. 1).

   The data were reformatted and converted to watershed data management
   (WDM) format using the IOWDM program (Flynn and others, 1994; available
   at: http://water.usgs.gov/software/iowdm.html). The data were then
   analyzed for flow frequency using the program SWSTAT (Flynn and others,
   1994; http://water.usgs.gov/software/swstat.html). The frequency
   hydrograph routine of SWSTAT calculates the relative frequency of flows
   for every day of the year for the period of record. Output from this
   program consists of flow exceedance percentiles (for example, 90^th
   percentile, 50^th percentile) and the corresponding flow for each day
   of the year.  The program was run to extract flows that were equaled or
   exceeded 90, 75, 25, and 10 percent of the time.

   The exceedance data were then plotted as shaded bands by day of the
   year to illustrate variations in flow during the year and over the 100
   years of modeled record (fig. 3). Vertical variation in the graphs is a
   measure of variation among years and horizontal variation is a measure
   of seasonal variation. Overlays of reference alternatives present
   opportunities for visual comparisons.  Each of the new flow-management
   alternatives is compared to the run of river scenario (ROR - shown in
   light gray in graphs) and the 90^th and 10^th percentile flows of the
   Current Water Control Plan (CWCP - shown as black lines).

                Figure 3. Components of frequency hydrographs

   For comparison, full-service and minimum-service navigation flow
   targets (table 1) are shown for Sioux City, Nebraska City, and Kansas
   City graphs (COE, 1998b). Releases from Gavins Point dam to maintain
   navigation targets typically are higher than the target (for example, a
   28.5 kcfs release compared to a 25 kcfs target for minimum navigation;
   34.5 kcfs release compared to 31 kcfs target for full-service
   navigation).  Releases are higher than the targets to compensate for
   diminishing tributary inflows and to avoid having to increase flows
   during the tern and plover nesting season.

   The approximate discharge corresponding to the flood stage defined by
   the National Weather Service (NWS) flood stage also is indicated on
   each graph. The NWS flood stage is specific to the gage sites, and is
   highly dependent on the channel geometry as determined by levees and
   floodwalls. The NWS flood stage was converted to discharge by reference
   to U.S. Geological Survey stage-discharge rating curves for each gage.

   A second set of four graphs was developed to show the effects of flow
   alternatives on the highest flows. These graphs present the maximum
   flows occurring for each day of the year over the 100 years of modeled
   flows. The ROR scenario and discharge at NWS flood stage are shown for
   comparison.

   Table 1. Full- and minimum-service navigation flow targets at three
   locations on the Lower Missouri River (COE, 1998b).  Flows from Gavins
   Point dam are managed to maintain navigation targets at sites
   downstream, and so generally are somewhat higher than the targets; see
   text for additional information.   Navigation targets are not defined
   by the Corps of Engineers for Boonville, Missouri.

   Modeled Flow-Management Alternatives

   The following flow-management alternatives are analyzed and presented
   here. Except for ROR, all the alternatives include drought conservation
   measures, reservoir unbalancing, and tern and plover mitigation rules
   (see COE, 1998a). The alternatives are identified by the codes shown in
   bold.  The Master Manual RDEIS (COE, 2001) emphasizes that the modeled
   Gavins Point (GP) management alternatives are meant to indicate a range
   of spring rise and summer low-flow conditions. The starting point for
   GP releases would be the GP1528, but the actual Gavins Point dam
   releases would be determined through an ongoing adaptive management
   process based on monitoring of biological responses.

   Reference Alternatives:

   ·         ROR
   The run of river alternative where streamflow is modeled for the
   conditions of constantly full reservoirs. Except for some evaporation
   from the reservoirs and the effects of small, triburary reservoirs,, it
   provides a realistic depiction of flows in the absence of regulation,
   that is, an estimate of  natural-river alternative.

   ·         CWCP
   The Current Water Control Plan for the Missouri River Mainstem
   Reservoir System (MRMRS).


   Management Alternatives:


   ·         MCP

   Modified Conservation Plan where, during drought conditions, more water
   is conserved in upstream reservoirs by reducing navigation earlier in
   the season than in the CWCP.


   The following four flow-alternatives evaluate the relative effects of
   high and low flow from Gavins Point (GP) dam. High flow is added to
   releases that are sufficient to meet  full-service navigation targets,
   nominally 34.5 kcfs (see Table 1). The spring rise is proposed to occur
   on an average of once very 3 years, as conditions allow. Low flows are
   achieved by subtracting 6 kcfs  (for GP1528, GP2028), or 13.5 and 9.5
   kcfs (for GP1521 and GP2021) from full-service navigation releases.


   ·         GP1521

   High: A 15 kcfs spring rise above full-service navigation releases.
   Low: A split navigation season with two low-flow periods during the
   summer of 21 and 25 kcfs.


   ·         GP1528
   High: A 15 kcfs spring rise above full-service navigation releases.

   Low: A release of 28.5 kcfs (full-service navigation) throughout the
   navigation season.


   ·         GP2021
   High: A 20 kcfs spring rise above full-service navigation releases.

   Low: A split navigation season with two low-flow periods during the
   summer of 21 and 25 kcfs as proposed in GP1521.


   ·         GP2028

   High: A 20 kcfs spring rise above full-service navigation releases.

   Low: A release of 28.5 kcfs (full service navigation) throughout the
   navigation season.

   Results

   The following hydrographs for the modeled reference and flow-
   management alternatives graphically show the differences among modeled
   flow-management alternatives for each site as well as showing the
   variable effects from upstream to downstream:

   ·        Frequency Hydrographs

   ·        Maximum-Flow Hydrographs

   The frequency hydrographs show the seasonal and interannual variability
   of modeled flows that would be equaled or exceeded 10, 25, 75, and 90
   percent of the time. The degree of change associated with the
   flow-management alternatives varies geographically, and is most
   pronounced at Sioux City, the station closest to Gavins Point dam.
   Downstream on the Lower Missouri River, additions of discharge from
   non-regulated or little-regulated tributary drainage basins modifies
   the effects of reservoir regulation. As a result, the modeled
   flow-management alternatives converge toward the Current Water Control
   Plan (CWCP) and exhibit greater seasonal variation for downstream
   stations.

   The maximum-flow hydrographs show the seasonal variability of modeled
   maximum flows for each day of the year. These flows are those that are
   equaled or exceeded only one percent of the time on average. The
   discharges associated with NWS flood stage are specific to the gage
   sites, and are highly dependent on the channel geometry as determined
   by levees and floodwalls. The flow-management alternatives generally
   plot at lower discharges than the ROR alternative during the spring and
   at greater or equivalent discharges during August-November. The CWCP,
   MCP, and GP alternatives all plot nearly on top of one another; a few
   exceptions show 10-20 kcfs differences among the alternatives. In Sioux
   City the flow-management alternatives all plot substantially lower than
   the local flood stage discharge, with the exception of flows in June
   1984. Moving downstream where flow is less regulated, maximum flows
   plot more frequently above flood-stage discharges.
