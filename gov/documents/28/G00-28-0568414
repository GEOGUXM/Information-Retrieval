   GIM for Wide Area Augmentation System

   A variant of GIM technology is being implemented for the Federal
   Aviation Administration's Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), as part
   of a new aircraft navigation system based on GPS. Due to begin Phase-I
   operation in 1998, this robust, real-time system will provide
   ionospheric vertical delay calibrations accurate to 50 cm or better to
   all WAAS users in the US (uncalibrated delays can reach 14 meters
   during solar maximum).

   WAAS Ionospheric Software

   JPL's WAAS Ionospheric Software (WIS) will be used to estimate the
   delays over a set of Earth-fixed grid points that are spread out over
   the coverage area. The delay at each grid location will be broadcast to
   users who will then estimate the delay at their position, which is
   generally off the grid. The corrections are based on dual-frequency GPS
   data collected from a network of 24 GPS reference receivers in the US,
   being implemented as part of the WAAS program.
