   The people of Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) create and
   manage NASA projects of exploration throughout our solar system and
   beyond.

   This is a training module designed primarily to help JPL operations
   people identify the range of concepts associated with deep space
   missions and grasp the relationships these concepts exhibit for space
   flight. It also enjoys growing popularity among high school and college
   students, as well as faculty and people everywhere who are interested
   in interplanetary space flight.

   The Basics of Space Flight attempts to offer a broad scope, but limited
   depth, as a background for further investigation; many other resources
   are available, of course, for delving into each of the topics related
   here. Indeed, any one of these topics can involve a lifelong career of
   specialization. This module's purpose is met if the participant learns
   the scope of concepts that apply to interplanetary space exploration
   and the relationships between them.

   This module is intended to be used online via the worldwide web
   (http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/basics). There are interactive quizzes to let
   you check your own progress. No academic credit is offered for
   completing the module.

   Interplanetary adventure begins . . .
