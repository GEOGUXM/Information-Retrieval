   The Mojave Ecosystem Database Program (MEDP) represents the Department
   of Defense's (DOD) first attempt to meld together a shared scientific
   database that can be used to affect dynamic sustainable land management
   decisions. MDEP is not in and of itself a management process, but a
   tool to make possible more accurate modeling of environmental factors
   that will facilitate data driven management within the Mojave
   Ecoregion. Additionally, MEDP fits within the framework more broadly
   based management plans being promulgated under the Department of the
   Interior.

   MISSION STATEMENT: The MDEP cooperative project will support the
   continued capability of mission critical Department of Defense
   installations within the Mojave Desert Ecosystem to maintain military
   preparedness and readiness while protecting the environment. Regional
   Mojave scientific, natural and cultural resource professionals have
   agreed upon the importance of the development of mechanisms by which
   land use management decisions can be made to maintain the Mojave Desert
   ecosystem while supporting sustainable economies, communities and
   national defense preparedness. Therefore, the project goal is
   development and implementation of a database, which will facilitate
   collection, storage, transfer, sharing and analysis of information
   regarding inventories, resource assessments, scientific documentation
   and land management by all federal, state, regional and local agencies
   and other interested parties. The queryable computer database shall be
   developed and deployed to provide land managers and resource
   specialists the ecosystem wide tools for informed decision making.
   Sharing scientific data among the various agencies will reduce
   duplication of effort, which is a consideration of particular
   importance in a time of limited federal dollars. In order to develop a
   useable database, it is proposed that archival records and literature
   searches be completed for natural and cultural resources. Data sets
   will be located, documented, evaluated and a determination made of data
   gaps. Elimination of data gaps, under the direction of regional experts
   and resource managers, will constitute the final phases of the project.
   The product shall directly support the military readiness in the region
   through provision of a framework for determining research strategies,
   mitigation measures and designing enlightened, long-term resource
   planning to ensure ongoing activities including training mission
   objectives.
