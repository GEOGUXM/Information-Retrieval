   New Airport Security Rules in Effect

   As of 18-Jan-02, a new law requires that all checked luggage be
   screened for bombs. As the date approaches, federal transportation and
   airline officials concede they havent figured out how to meet the
   deadline, but pledge that they will...somehow. Under the Aviation
   Security Act, each piece must be searched by hand (which would take
   many hours), by a bomb-detecting machine (there are very few of these
   available in just the major airports), by a bomb-sniffing dog (there is
   a canine shortage as well), or an X-ray machine (likewise, not enough
   to meet the need). It would appear that the fallback plan will be
   employed at many airports: 100% bag matching (confirming that each
   checked bag belongs to a passenger who has boarded the plane). And this
   plan can create substantial delays. If the bags are loaded, the plane
   is ready to depart, and a confirmed passenger is not on board (for
   whatever reason), the flight has to be delayed until the missing
   persons baggage can be located in the planes luggage hold and removed).
