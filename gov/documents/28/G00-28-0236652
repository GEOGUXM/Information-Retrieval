    PARENT REPRESENTATIVE

   Steve Rainey, Parent Ex Officio Representative
   on the WSSB Board of Trustees

   Home Phone: 360-253-5844

   email: Steve.Rainey@NOAA.gov

   As parent representative, I have experienced the challenges and rewards
   of raising a blind child. My wife, Leslie, and I have a daughter who
   has been a resident and day-student at WSSB, and has been in local
   schools with support through the WSSB Outreach Program. She is in her
   seventh year with WSSB.

   >One of the primary needs I support is improved parent communication
   within WSSB and with parents of blind children throughout the state. If
   you are parent of a blind child and have questions, or a desire to have
   a parent gathering to learn more about how to attain the best possible
   education for your child, call or write to me.

   As a parent who has been there, I'd love to assist you with any
   questions or requests you may have.

   Sincerely, Steve Rainey
