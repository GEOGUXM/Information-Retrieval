                        The Evolution of LandView^®

                                    rule

   LandView has its roots in the CAMEO system (Computer-Aided Management
       of Emergency Operations). CAMEO was developed by the EPA and the
       NOAA to facilitate the implementation of the Emergency Planning and
       Community Right-to-Know Act. This far-reaching law requires
       communities to develop emergency response plans addressing chemical
       hazards and to make available to the public information on chemical
       hazards in the community.
       CAMEO DOS, first released in 1991, contained a mapping program
       called MARPLOT, which provided access to computerized street maps
       based on the U.S. Census Bureau TIGER/Line® files. MARPLOT was
       subsequently enhanced to include Census boundaries and demographic
       statistics, and was included in the TIGER/Line 1992 CD-ROM product,
       under the name of LandView.
       For the latest information on CAMEO and MARPLOT, see the CAMEO Home
       page.
       In response to the need to map hazardous sites that were inundated
       by the widespread Mississippi river floods of 1993, LandView became
       a separate CD-ROM product that was released in 1995 as LandView II.
       LandView II included additional EPA-regulated sites and recently
       released 1990 Census socioeconomic demographic data. Being a
       DOS-based program, LandView II was limited by the DOS memory
       restrictions, and was difficult to run in memory-intensive
       environments, such as local-area networks. To solve that problem,
       and to provide additional capabilities and ease of use, the
       LandView software was converted to the Windows platform. Two
       programs were developed, MARPLOT for Windows (the mapping engine),
       and LandView (the database search and query engine). Both programs
       have also been converted to run on the Macintosh platform. This
       Windows/Macintosh cross-platform system, with the inclusion of
       updated Census and EPA data, and data from several other federal
       agencies was released on CD-ROM as LandView III in January 1998.
       LandView IV was released to the public on DVD-ROM in November 2000.
       This version of LandView contained an revised LandView program
       interface that would run on 32-bit operating systems like Windows
       98, NT, and 2000 and support faster processors. Use of DVD
       technology supplanted the 11 CD-ROM LandView III set with a single
       DVD. This enhancement allowed a user to view detailed road networks
       and other features anywhere in the nation without having to change
       discs. The new LandView software allowed users with Internet
       connections to connect to on-line databases of each agency to get
       the most up-to-date information for a particular map site. The
       greater capacity of the DVD allowed the popular population
       estimator used for calculation of population within a radius for
       such things as the EPA Risk Management Plans (RMP) to provide more
       accurate results based on 7 plus million 1990 census blocks.
       Because all the block data could be stored on the DVD in a single
       database, users could now able to do radius calculations crossing
       any combination of state boundaries. In addition, the additional
       disc capacity allowed for the expansion of the data from the USGS
       GNIS which additional information regarding places and features
       contained on USGS maps.
       We are currently working on a LandView 5 which will contain the
       most up-to-date data for each agency plus computerized street maps
       based on TIGER/Line 2000.
