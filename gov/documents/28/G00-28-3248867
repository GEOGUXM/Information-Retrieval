     __________________________________________________________________

   1. Purpose. An important part of an employee's general responsibilities
   is to insure that his or her talents, skills, and abilities are
   constantly sharpened or renewed in order to serve with the greatest
   proficiency. One way to do this is by reading which requires access to
   books, periodicals, reports, etc. A station's library is the primary
   source of these materials.

   This chapter describes the NOAA library system and the
   interrelationship of the station library; assigns organizational
   responsibility; makes suggestions on the use of library space and
   facilities; tells how to borrow, obtain for retention, and dispose of
   library material; and presents guidelines for the selection of material
   for station libraries.

   2. Description of the NOAA Library System. The library system is
   composed of all the scientific libraries throughout NOAA. The Libraries
   Branch of NOAA operates the scientific libraries in the Washington area
   and provides functional supervision for the entire system. The purpose
   of the system is to support the management, research, and operational
   needs of NOAA with appropriate and compatible library literature and
   facilities.

   Libraries maintained (usually, but not necessarily, by the Scientific
   Services Division) in regional headquarters are functionally under the
   NOAA Libraries Branch which is assisted by:

           a. The Technical Procedures Branch, Weather Analysis and
   Prediction Division, MO, WSH.

           b. The Hydrologic Service Division, O/H, WSH.

           c. Field Services, Environmental Data Service, NOAA.

   Other individuals or organizational elements may be consulted from time
   to time. These offices assist in the determination of the best books
   and technical reference materials for regional headquarters and station
   libraries.

   Station libraries are overseen by regional headquarters (usually, but
   not necessarily, the Scientific Services Division), but the on-site
   responsibility for a station library resides with the MIC or OIC, who
   may delegate the responsibility.

   3. Space and Facilities. About 50 square feet of floor space should be
   allowed for a useable station library. A larger area may be required
   for those stations with diversified programs and a larger staff.

   Facilities should consist of:

     a. For readers--table, chairs, and a display facility for new
     material being routed through the station.

   b. Shelving or bookcases and vertical files.

   c. Index system and loan facility.

   4. Borrowing, Station Library Material. All material should be
   available for loan to station personnel for a reasonable period with
   simple, but effective, control; exceptions should be publications that
   need to be kept at the library at all times (e.g., dictionaries,
   atlases, glossaries, etc.)

   The length of the loan period should be governed by the need and nature
   of the item. For example, someone taking a correspondence course may
   need a textbook for a few months. On the other hand, a journal article
   of interest to many at the station should be loaned for a few days.

   A simple, but effective, control means a record to show what was
   borrowed (author and title), name of borrower, date borrowed, and the
   date returned. An important reason for this control is to help in the
   prompt recall of a given item for urgent use by someone at, or
   occasionally outside, the station.

   5. Borrowing from Other NOAA Libraries. When temporary need of a
   library item arises, the regional headquarters should be contacted
   first as the regional headquarters library may have the item available
   for loan. In the case of an item of relatively few pages, a photocopy
   may be furnished in lieu of a loan.

   If the regional headquarters library does not have the needed item, a
   memorandum should be sent to the Atmospheric Sciences Library (AD711)
   requesting the loan of the item. Loan requests for material from the
   Atmospheric Sciences Library Accessions List should include the
   pertinent issue number and item number.

   6. Obtaining Publications for Retention. Regional headquarters has
   responsibility for obtaining U.S. Government publications (including
   subscriptions), atlases, dictionaries, handbooks, and so-called
   administrative library materials such as airlines guides, shipping
   news, etc.

   The Atmospheric Sciences Library, Silver Spring, Maryland, arranges for
   purchase of books and subscriptions for Journals in scientific and
   related fields. Organization code(s) and project numbers should be
   furnished by regional headquarters.

   All literature received for retention at the station should be stamped
   with the following information:

   NOAA

   National Weather Service

   (name of station)

   LIBRARY

   7. Disposing of Library Material. Periodic examination and discarding
   of materials is needed to maintain an up-to-date library. When library
   materials become obsolete and/or are no longer needed at a station,
   regional headquarters should be contacted to find out if the material
   is needed there or at some other station.

   After clearance with regional headquarters, books and other material
   that are no longer needed may be offered to a local college or public
   library. Ownership marks must be cancelled, and the materials
   transferred without expense to the Government.

   Materials not wanted by anyone should be destroyed as waste paper.

   No notification to the Atmospheric Sciences Library is needed for
   materials transferred or discarded.

   8. Guidelines for the Selection of Library Materials. Appendix A is a
   list of library materials for WSFOs and the larger WSOs, e.g., those
   with extensive programs. Smaller WSOs, RFCs, RDOs, WSMOs and state
   climatologist offices will need fewer materials from Appendix A. The
   selection of material must be validated by regional headquarters.
   Stations receiving NOAA and WS Technical Memoranda, etc., should file
   these by series. Appendices B through H are lists of supplementary
   materials to support specialized program areas for aviation, marine,
   agriculture, forestry, air pollution, hydrology, and climatology,
   respectively. Station libraries may contain all or parts of these
   listings depending on the strength of the stations program in these
   areas.

   All listings are intended as guidelines for the selection of materials
   and are not intended to imply that a station should immediately order
   materials it does not have or that texts and other materials not listed
   should not be in a station's library.
