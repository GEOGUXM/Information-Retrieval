   aerospace education
   A close working relationship with the educational community is a vital
   component of the NASA mission. At the pre-college level, NASA works
   closely with the educators to provide supplementary educational
   programs, products and services that are valuable resources for
   teachers and students and that support the national standards for
   education. At the post-secondary level, NASA depends on colleges and
   universities for research support and intellectual expertise, while the
   university research community benefits from NASA resources and
   direction.

   NASA's Office of Aerospace Technology recognizes that its national
   leadership role in Aerospace research offers unique opportunities to
   support education outreach activities. We are firmly committed to
   supporting the NASA Implementation Plan for Education with its emphasis
   on contributing to educational excellence, developing alliances with
   key external constituencies, and involving the educational community at
   all levels in our projects and programs. The links at the top of this
   page, under the Education tab, will take you to a wide range of NASA
   online educational programs, products and services that are designed to
   capture the interest of students while helping educators incorporate
   the exciting work of NASA's Aerospace Technology Enterprise into math,
   science and technology curricula at all levels.
