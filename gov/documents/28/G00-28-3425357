ERS-1 and ERS-2 USO and SPTR Corrections

   There are two corrections which ESA has released to the ERS-1 and ERS-2
   ranges that are not being applied to the online Greenland and
   Antarctica data. The first of these is a correction for a drift in the
   Ultra-Stable Oscillator(USO). The second is the Scanning Point Target
   Response(SPTR) correction. The characterization of these two
   corrections can be found on the ESRIN ERS Web pages.
