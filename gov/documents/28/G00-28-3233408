                          Science Exploration Camp

                         A Summer Camp for Children

   The Science Exploration Camp provides a mix of recreational and
   science-oriented activities for school-age children of LBNL employees.
   We are offering enrollment, on a weekly basis, for the last six weeks
   of the summer.  Dates for Summer Camp 2001 are from July 23 through
   August 31.

   This summer's offering follows a successful 1999 session at LBNL.

   The camp is run by the Summer Child Care Subcommittee of the Work
   Family Committee who have formed a non-profit corporation entitled
   Science Exploration Camp (SEC).  Since its inception, SEC has been
   administered by a volunteer board of directors. The directors hire
   staff and volunteer their time to organize the camp and to participate
   in the program as support to the staff. We strongly encourage employees
   to join the SEC Board. The Summer program is not subsidized by LBNL due
   to DOE regulations. However, a memo of understanding (MOU) between LBNL
   and SEC to run the program at LBNL has been drafted in cooperation with
   LBNL.  The Science Exploration Camp is self supported by camp fees.
   Parent participation allows us to contain the fees to below those
   charged by outside organizations.

   Program: The core program will run from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., with a
   morning science component and afternoon recreational activities. The
   science component is based upon weekly themes and will be held at the
   Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Lawrence Hall of Science, and UC
   Botanical Gardens in Berkeley, California. Recreational activities will
   include adventures in local parks, swimming, etc. LBNL buses, UC
   charter buses and/or public transportation will be used for
   transportation.

   Before and after camp care from 7:45 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to
   5:15 p.m. is included in the fees. During these hours, quiet activities
   will be provided. Every effort will be made to accommodate those
   parents that begin work before 8:00 a.m.

   Program size: The program will accommodate a maximum of 30 children
   entering second to sixth grade, although this will depend upon the
   response to registration. High-school aged children may possibly
   participate as counselors-in-training.

   Staffing: The camp will be staffed with a science teacher as Camp
   Director, an Assistant Director and three counselors. Detailed job
   descriptions can be found in Job Openings. Interested parents are
   encouraged to present a science module, or accompany the campers on
   outings. Other volunteers, such as retirees, may also be solicited.
