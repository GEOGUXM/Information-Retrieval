   King County Lakes Data
   Lake Washington and Lake Sammamish
   Periodically the R.U.S.S. Buoys undergo maintenance, or experience
   equipment failures. As a result, data transfer may be intermittent at
   times. At this time all Meterological data are zero until we build up
   another buoy on Lake Sammamish.
