   Welcome to the new Office of Governmentwide Policy home page. We've
   improved this site to help you, our client.

   To understand about our organization  First a little history  The
   Office of Governmentwide Policy (OGP) was created on December 20, 1995,
   to consolidate all of GSA's governmentwide policy-making activities
   within one central office. These include the Federal government's
   strategies to acquire $200 billion a year in goods and services, the $8
   billion a year spent on government travel, and the tens of billions of
   dollars spent each year on internal administrative management systems.

   We are working to re-engineer the traditional policy development model
   to emphasize collaborative development. The new model calls for
   involvement of other federal agencies, the private sector, interested
   parties, and other stakeholders from the very onset of policy review
   and/or formulation. Such collaborative efforts are seen to offer
   numerous advantages, not least of which is to ensure "buy-in" from the
   policy customers.

   Our goal is clear. We want to ensure that governmentwide policies allow
   and encourage agencies to develop and utilize the best, most cost
   effective management practices for the conduct of their specific
   programs.
