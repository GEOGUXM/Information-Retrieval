   About the Health Gap

     The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and ABC Radio
     Networks are working together to sponsor Closing the Health Gap, a
     national campaign to bring the best health information to African
     American communities and help African American consumers take charge
     of their health. These health tips and resources for further
     information can help you get started, or continue on the road to a
     healthier life for you and your family. Information specialists at
     agencies and clearinghouses throughout the Department are ready to
     answer your health questions and find the help you need.

   Take Charge of Your Health!

     We can help you take charge of your health, find a health provider
     near you, check out public programs like Medicare or Medicaid, hear
     our radio messages online, or simply learn more about The Health Gap
     and the health issues affecting African American communities.

     We've included some of the most popular web pages to get you
     started. They cover the various health topics we'll be addressing in
     the Closing the Health Gap campaign. These include general health
     pages with information useful to all consumers, pages with consumer
     information specifically for African American consumers, and the
     home pages of the major health agencies within the U.S. Department
     of Health and Human Services.

     participation of Federal agencies and non-federal consumer health
     information specialists, librarians, and others engaged in the
     provision or use of online consumer health information. 4woman.gov,
     the web site of HHS' National Women's Health Information Center, can
     help you link to, read, and download a wide variety of women's
     health-related material developed by the HHS, other Federal
     agencies, and private sector resources. Both sites have links to
     thousands of handpicked, commercial-free, and reliable health
     resources on the web.
