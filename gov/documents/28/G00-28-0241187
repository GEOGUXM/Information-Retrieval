   For the 21st century, a top strategic goal of the Department of
   Transportation (DOT) is to "Promote the public health and safety by
   working toward the elimination of transportation-related deaths,
   injuries, and property damage." Another strategic goal is to "Protect
   and enhance communities and the natural environment affected by
   transportation." Because of significant danger posed to the traveling
   public from the illegal shipment of hazardous materials (HazMat), the
   Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Department's criminal
   investigative element, has made its Hazardous Material Transportation
   Safety Program one of its highest investigative priorities.
   The Office of Hazardous Materials Safety, which is within DOT's
   Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), is responsible for
   coordinating a national safety program for the transportation of HazMat
   by air, rail, highway and water. In addition to RSPA, there are several
   other DOT Administrations involved in HazMat related matters to include
   the Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the
   Federal Railroad Administration.
   Most criminal violations of HazMat regulations involve falsification
   and misrepresentation of documentation used to identify products being
   shipped. Misrepresenting the actual, as opposed to the declared,
   product being shipped can jeopardize the safety of the traveling
   public. In combating this serious safety related problem, OIG Special
   Agents are working with FBI, EPA/CID, and other Federal and state
   officials to investigate these matters and report them to the
   Department of Justice for prosecution.
