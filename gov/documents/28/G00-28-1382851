   U.S. Capitol Building

                            Constituent Services

   As the Representative for the 11^th Congressional District of Georgia,
   I consider it a privilege to look into constituent inquiries from the
   citizens that I represent.  Given the volume of inquiries my office
   receives, I must refer inquiries outside the 11^th District to the
   appropriate Representative.  This long-standing tradition of
   congressional courtesy ensures high standards of quality in responding
   to my constituents' requests.

   One of the many services I am able to provide to my constituents is
   tickets to many of the wonderful sites in Washington, D.C.  Tickets can
   be obtained by using my Visiting Washington page.
