Educational Opportunities

                            [blue_green_line.gif]

   The Biology and Biotechnology Research Program provides educational and
   profe ssional training opportunities for their staff, as well as to a
   wide array of st udents and faculty. The research and work experiences
   are designed to enhance th e quality of science education at all levels
   and encourage diversity among people pursuing careers in the biomedical
   sciences. The programs integrate students and faculty into ongoing
   research projects and provide opportunities for them to expand their
   scientific and technical knowledge. The programs encourage students to
   continue their education in science. The summer programs allow students
   and faculty to extend and refresh their training and knowledge of areas
   of current research, and hence increase their ability to encourage
   students to pursue careers in science.

   conduct an extended research project as a member of an ongoing research
   program for an academic semester.
   Student Technology Experience Program (STEP). This program provides
   meaningful work experience to high school and college students, to
   encourage them to pursue further education in science, engineering or
   business.
   Biology & Biotechnology Research Student Technical Program. This
   program is designed to provide opportunities for undergraduate college
   students to pursue a specific research project relevant to their
   studies.
   Student Participating Guests. These students use lab facilities and/or
   participate in lab work as part of their academic studies for high
   school, an undergraduate, or graduate degree.
   Participating Teacher/Guests. These teachers use lab facilities and/or
   participate in lab work to keep abreast of current research and improve
   classroom instruction.

Summer Programs

   Summer Research Internship Program. This program matches teachers with
   research projects where they learn about new areas of science and
   technology and identify materials that can be incorporated in their
   curricula.
   LLNL Summer Employment Program. This program coordinates the summer
   employment opportunities for students throughout the Laboratory.
   Associated Western Universities Summer Program (AWU). This cooperative
   research program promotes and coordinates research and training in
