              The Learning Assistance Program:
Options to Align State Funding Formula with Education Reform

                                                                                        [teachhelp.gif]
    _______________________________________________________________

The Learning Assistance Program (LAP) was created in 1987 to provide
extra assistance to low-achieving students, although special state
funding initiatives for remediation date back to 1979.  LAP provides
funding to school districts based on the number of students who score
in the bottom quartile on standardized basic skills tests.  For the
2001-03 biennium, the state appropriated $139 million for LAP.  School
districts will receive just over $400 per low-scoring student.

Several studies of LAP have been conducted in the last 10 years.  In
1996, the funding formula was adjusted to provide some additional
resources for districts with above average poverty levels.  In 1999,
the legislature added low-achieving students in grades 10 and 11 to the
formula assumptions.

However, a new review of how the state provides special funds to assist
low-achieving students may be timely due to the following factors:
  * Although students still take standardized tests, the Washington
    Assessment of Student Learning (WASL) is becoming the basis for
    holding schools and school districts accountable for improving
    student learning under education reform.
  * Federal funds for remediation (Title I) are now targeted at schools
    with above average poverty levels.  Success is measured by
    school-wide improvements on state standards-based assessments.  For
    years, LAP and Title I have been nearly indistinguishable
    programs.
  * The 2001 Legislature created a new focused assistance program  for
    schools with large numbers of students who are not meeting state
    standards.  Possible connections between LAP and focused assistance
    could be explored.

The Legislature directed the Institute to examine options for revising
the LAP funding formula to enhance accountability for school
performance in meeting education reform goals.  The study will address
the following research questions:
  * How are Learning Assistance Program funds allocated?  How are they
    spent?  How do formula assumptions about staff and eligible
    students compare to actual practice?  How do school districts
    provide services through the LAP program?  How do other states
    provide special funding to assist low-achieving students?
  * How is LAP coordinated with other programs to assist low-achieving
    students?  How are LAP programs coordinated with federally funded
    Title I programs?  To what extent do school districts combine
    state, federal, and local resources to target assistance at
    buildings or students with the lowest achievement?
  * What is known about LAP and student performance?   How well do
    students in LAP score on standardized tests or the WASL?  How do
    school districts assign students to LAP and how do they measure
    student progress?
  * How could the state funding formula for LAP be revised to enhance
    accountability for meeting education reform goals?   In addition to
    standardized test scores, what are other possible ways to identify
    students or schools needing additional assistance?  What are the
    advantages, disadvantages, and factors to be considered for a
    selected number of alternative funding formulas?

  A final report is due to the Legislature by June 30, 2002.
