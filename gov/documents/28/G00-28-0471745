   Our policy for adding Internet links is found below.

   All authority to add or remove links to the City of Chattanooga web
   site shall be retained by the contracted Internet Service Provider
   (ISP) which provides internet portal access for the City of
   Chattanooga. The City of Chattanooga's web site will point to its
   contracted ISP as a portal but will not make any decisions relating to
   the content of any links provided by the ISP. The ISP will have
   complete authority and discretion over the links it provides from its
   portal location.

   The City of Chattanooga will only provide links for consideration by
   the ISP that are presented as an integral part of any article included
   on the City's web site. The City of Chattanooga's web site is not a
   public forum for submitting requested internet links and there are no
   exceptions to this policy. City employees are authorized to maintain
   any resident Internet link favorites to the extent that such favorites
   do not otherwise violate the Computer Use Policy adopted by the City.
