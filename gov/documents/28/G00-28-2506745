   From Orlando International Airport:
     * Follow signs to 528 East (the Beeline).
     * Take the Beeline east to a left exit labeled 407, Titusville,
       Kennedy Space Center.
     * Take 407 until it ends at 405.
     * Turn right onto 405 and proceed east.
     * After approximately 1 mile, you will see a Redstone rocket on your
       right -- this is the KSC Badge and Identification Building and the
       entrance to Kennedy Space Center.

   A special badge may be required for entrance to Kennedy Space Center.
   Contact the Property Disposal Office at 321-867-7027 at least 24 hours
   in advance prior to arrival at Kennedy Space Center.

   In the event of increased security restrictions at Kennedy Space
   Center, entrance for participation in the Surplus Sales Program will be
   through the Titusville Gate only (Gate 3 on 405).
