   Seismic hazards are those related to ground shaking. Landslides, ground
   cracks, rockfalls, tsunami - these are all seismic hazards. Generally,
   though, we think more in terms of damage to our structures and our
   possessions.

   Engineers, seismologists, architects, and planners have carefully
   evaluated seismic hazards related to building construction. They have
   devised a system of classifying seismic hazards on the basis of the
   expected strength of ground shaking and the probability of the shaking
   actually occurring within a specified time. The results are included in
   the Uniform Building Code (UBC) seismic provisions.

   The UBC seismic provisions contain six seismic zones, ranging from 0
   (no chance of severe ground shaking) to 4 (10% chance of severe shaking
   in a 50-year interval). The shaking is quantified in terms of g-force
   (familiar to race car drivers and astronauts), the earth's
   gravitational acceleration. The diagram below is a way of describing
   seismic zonation.

Zonation Based on General Principles

   In 1992, the USGS was asked to reevaluate the seismic hazards in
   Hawai`i County. A probabilistic seismic-hazards assessment was carried
   out according to previously established procedures.

   Seismic-hazards analysis combines:
     * Earthquake rates known from the historical record
     * Information about how strong ground shaking dissipates with
       increasing distance from the earthquake
     * Determination of the probabilities that specified levels of ground
       motion will occur in a specified time period

   The new calculations indicate that Hawai`i County has a greater chance
   of strong ground shaking than was previously thought.
