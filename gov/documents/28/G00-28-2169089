   Everyone has a role in keeping food safe, from the farmer to the
   consumer. CDFA oversees the safety of California's milk and milk
   products, it also assures that meat inspection not covered by USDA is
   safe. The Department works closely with many agricultural commodity
   groups to develop safe and efficient methods of food production via
   voluntary, proactive quality assurance programs.




                                 Food Safety


   The U.S. food safety system is complex, being composed of many federal,
   state, and local stakeholders, including agriculture, health, and
   environmental agencies. It is not uncommon for several agencies to play
   roles in assuring the safety of a single food commodity from farm to
   fork.

   Animal and Plant Products

   Regulations governing the safety of animal and plant products at the
   production level are enforced by the Food and Drug Administration
   (FDA), the California Department of Health Services, CDFA Milk and
   Dairy Foods Control Branch, and local health departments. Regulations
   governing food processing are enforced by the Food and Drug
   Administration, the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service, and CDFA
   programs including the Egg Inspection Branch, CDFA Meat and Poultry
   Inspection Branch, and CDFA Milk and Dairy Foods Control Branch. CDFA's
   Production Food Safety Program and other Department programs work with
   egg producers, processors, academia, and other agencies to proactively
   assure the safety of eggs through voluntary quality assurance programs
   such as the California Egg Quality Assurance Program, California
   Poultry Meat Quality Assurance Program, and California Dairy Quality
   Assurance Program.

   Live Animals and Animal Feed

   The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine and CDFA Feed, Fertilizer, and
   Livestock Drugs Program enforces regulations governing the use of
   animal health products in food animals and the safety of animal feed,
   including the ruminant feed ban to prevent Bovine Spongiform
   Encephalopathy. The USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics and CDFA
   Animal Health Branch regulate the use of vaccines in food animals. The
   CDFA Animal Production Food Safety Program is working with producers,
   processors, academia, and other agencies to proactively assure the
   health and safety of animals through various quality assurance
   programs.

   Pesticides

   The use of pesticides is regulated by the Environmental Protection
   Agency and the California Department of Pesticide Regulation.
