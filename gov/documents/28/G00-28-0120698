   Summary
       Ultraviolet Radiation from the sun is an area of interest to both
       the scientific community and the general public. This web site is
       designed to serve both communities. The pages were developed with
       advice from the World Meteorological Organization's Scientific
       Advisory Group on UV Radiation. We have included over 190 links to
       other web sites, summaries of UV monitoring around the world, as
       well as information about upcoming meetings, instrument
       manufacturers, and recent publications. If you are interested in
       receiving information on UV radiation via e-mail, you can register
