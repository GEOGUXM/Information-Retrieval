   bullet  Collaborations -
          The GCMD collaborates with many projects, like NASA's Earth
          Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) as well as
          with the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), other
          government agencies and university data projects. The GCMD is
          the American Coordinating Node of the Committee on Earth
          Observation Satellites (CEOS) International Directory Network
          (IDN).

   bullet  Metadata Standards and Protocols -
          In addition to the GCMD's Directory Interchange Format (DIF), a
          number of other groups have developed metadata formats for
          various purposes. The GCMD is involved with these groups in
          promoting metadata use and working toward a uniform metadata
          standard.
