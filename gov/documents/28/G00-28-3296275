   MISSION PLAN 5.1 FLIGHT SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 5.1.1 Lander Bus - Cruise
   Stage, EDL and Propulsion Systems Cruise Stage: The lander flight
   system consists of a separable cruise stage with a MDAC Vband launch
   vehicle separation interface, and propulsive lander/entry assembly. The
   cruise stage is jettisoned just prior to atmospheric entry, providing a
   clean aerodynamic shape for entry and a reduced ballistic coefficient.
   Cruise stage operational components include redundant star cameras and
   sun sensors for attitude determination, two solar array wings (2.6m2
   total area) for power generation, an X-Band medium gain
   transmit/receive horn antenna and one low gain receive patch antenna
   and a redundant pair of solid state power amplifiers (SSPA's) for
   telecommunications during cruise. Threeaxis attitude control during
   cruise is provided using a redundant Inertial Measurement Units (IMU's)
   and four cruise reaction engine modules (REM's) located on the Lander.
   Each REM contains one aft-facing 5-lbf TCM thruster and one canted [20
   out, 15 aft] 1-lbf RCS thruster. EDL System: The 2.4 m diameter
   heatshield structure and ablator makes use of the tooling developed for
   Pathfinder, sharing the same nose radius and cone angle. The ballistic
   coefficient is 58 to 62 kg/m2, somewhat lower than Pathfinder. The
   Pathfinder parachute design is used to lower cost. As on Pathfinder,
   the parachute is deployed based on an on-board navigator velocity
   estimate, eliminating the longrange radar altimeter used on Viking. The
   parachute is mortar-deployed to ensure good separation for inflation in
   the freestream. After parachute deployment the heatshield is separated
   from the backshell, 3 landing legs are deployed, and the descent
   engines are warmed with short firing pulses. The MARDI descent imager
   starts operating shortly before heatshield separation. After a short
   parachute ride the flight software attitude control algorithms
   determine the optimum time to release the lander from the
   backshell/parachute to begin the powered descent phase. Propulsion
   System: Two diaphragm propellant tanks contain the 64 kg of purified
   hydrazine propellant used for both cruise maneuvers and attitude
   control as well as for lander powered descent. This is a
   pressure-regulated system with serially-redundant pressure regulators
   utilizing helium gas pressurant. For final descent, a Doppler radar
   provides accurate altitude and 3D velocity estimates. Descent control
   is provided by twelve 266 N retroengines arranged in three groups of
   four engines each. The engines are pulse modulated. As the lander
   descends to within 12 meters of the surface the spacecraft control
   system begins the 2.4 m/s constant velocity terminal descent phase.
   Landing engines are cutoff when any one of the lander footpads touches
   the planet surface. The AACS subsystem controls the orientation of the
   lander on landing, placing the X axis within 5 degrees of the desired
   azimuth [45 West of North, to maximize the solar array efficiency and
   minimize Direct To Earth (DTE) antenna blockage]. Go to TOC L.4 8/8/97

   meters above surface » Engines cut off when any of the footpads touch
   the surface » AACS subsystem controls landed orientation to place X
   axis within 5 of desired azimuth [45 West of North] Terminal Descent
   Configuration L.5 8/8/97 5.1.2 Lander Bus - Structure, Power/Thermal,
   Telecom Structure: The Lander structure is constructed of a composite
   material consisting of honeycomb aluminum core with graphite-epoxy
   facesheets bonded to each side. A thin aluminum sheet is bonded to the
   composite to provide a Faraday cage around the thermal enclosure. The
   landing legs are made of aluminum and have compression springs to
   deploy the legs from the stowed position. Tapered, crushable, aluminum
   honeycomb inserts in each leg provide the shock absorption necessary
   for landing. The design has a thermally isolated component deck inside
   of a central thermal enclosure to control the thermal environment for
   spacecraft and Payload electronics. Located within this enclosure is
   the Command and Data Handling (C&DH) electronics, the Power
   Distribution electronics (PDDU), the Charge Control Unit (CCU), the
   Nickel-Hydrogen Common Pressure Vessel Batteries (CPV's), The X-Band
   and UHF telecommunication electronics, and the Capillary Pump Loop Heat
   Pipe (LHP) components. Imbedded within the component deck are the LHP
   evaporators which transfer heat from the aluminum facesheets of the
   component deck to the LHP radiators located outside of the thermal
   enclosure. Components used only during EDL are mounted external to the
   enclosure to maximize volume inside the thermal enclosure for onsurface
   functions (The gyroscopes, pyro firing electronics, radar and radar
   electronics are located outside the thermal enclosure). Power and
   Thermal: For the landing footprint of 75° to 78° South latitudes the
   sun does not go below the nominal horizon for the season of the prime
   mission. However, a 10° terrain mask is assumed for power analyses and
   results in a defined day and night interval when the sun goes below the
   horizon mask. The solar array, consisting of 6 panels [4 fixed, 2
   deloyed] provides power during the daytime for payload operations and
   recharges the batteries which provide nighttime heater power for the
   thermal enclosure. The C&DH and Power Distribution electronics have a
   low-power sleep mode to reduce energy consumption at night. The lander
   lifetime is limited by the size of the batteries. As the nights get
   longer and colder late in the summer the heater power required at night
   increases until the demand can no longer be satisfied by the 16 A-hr
   batteries. The batteries then freeze and the mission ends. Daytime
   operations are limited by the size of the arrays and the amount of
   power required to recharge the batteries. The duration of the payload
   and spacecraft daytime operations is approximately 8-9 hours at
   landing, but decreases as the sun goes lower in the sky. The power
   system is designed for full operation in a dusty atmosphere of opacity
   (Tau) = 0.5. Survival under full dust storm conditions (Tau = 1) TBD
   may be possible with advance planning but is not a design requirement.
   Telecom: The primary telecom link for science data relay and spacecraft
   commanding is the UHF relay link to the `98 orbiter. A UHF link to Mars
   Global Surveyor is also available, for data relay only. Eight to ten
   UHF communication passes above 20° effective terrain mask can occur
   with each orbiter each day. An Xband, Direct-To-Earth link with a
   steerable dish is provided as a transmit/receive backup. The maximum
   duration of an X-Band transmit event is limited to one hour by the
   capability of the Loop Heat Pipe to transfer the heat energy from the
   X-Band Solid State Amplifier out of the thermal enclosure. The number
   of UHF and X-Band use cycles is limited by the amount of daytime power
   available. Go to TOC L.6 8/8/97 LANDER BUS - STRUCTURE, POWER/THERMAL,

   limited by daytime power L.7 8/8/97 5.1.3 Lander Payload - Mars Descent
   Imager [MARDI], LIDAR, New Millenium Microprobes Mars Descent Imager
   (MARDI) MARDI includes a single camera head consisting of optics, focal
   plane assembly and support electronics, and housing. Using a megapixel,
   electronically shuttered CCD, MARDI provides panchromatic images of the
   landing site with a resolution of 1.25 mrad/pixel. Images are taken
   starting just before heatshield jettison, and continue until landing.
   Under nominal circumstances approximately ten 1000 x 1000 pixel images
   will be acquired. Taken at altitudes less than 8 km above the surface,
   these images cover areas from 9 km to 9 m across and at resolutions of
   7.5 m to 9 mm per pixel pair. MARDI is built by Malin Space Science
   Systems (MSSS), with Dr. Michael Malin (MSSS) as Principal
   Investigator. LIDAR The LIDAR [Light Detection and Ranging] is an
   upward viewing lidar mounted on the Lander deck. It consists of a
   sensor assembly, an electronics assembly, and the interconnecting cable
   assembly. The LIDAR is provided by the Space Research Institute (IKI)
   of the Russian Academy of Science, under the sponsorship of the Russian
   Space Agency (RSA). The Principal Investigator is S. Linkin. The LIDAR
   transmitter uses a pulsed GaAlAs laser diode which emits 400 nJ energy
   in 100 nsec pulses at a rate of 2.5 kHz and at 0.88 µm wavelength. The
   LIDAR has two sounding modes. During active sounding, light pulses are
   emitted and their return timed in order to locate and characterize ice
   and dust hazes in the lowest few kilometers (< 2-3 km). An acoustic
   device [microphone] will also be included as part of the LIDAR
   assembly. New Millenium Microprobes Two microprobes supplied by the New
   Millenium Project will be carried aboard the Lander cruise stage and
   will deploy themselves 1520 seconds after separation of the cruise
   stage from the aeroshell. Each battery-powered microprobe penetrator
   will activate on separation, collect temperature, accelerometer, and
   engineering data during entry, and impact the surface at 180 m/s,
   destroying the integrated aeroshell. At impact the penetrator forebody
   penetrates > 0.3 m into the soil; a cable connects the forebody to the
   separable aft body which remains near the surface. The aft body
   contains batteries, a pressure sensor, sun detector, and a antenna for
   data relay through MGS. Immediately after impact, a soil sample will be
   taken, and the probes will begin listening for the MGS MR beacon. All
   data will be relayed via MGS during the probes' mission life, expected
   to be 2 sols [primary mission] to 30-45 sols [extended mission] in
   duration. Experiments include measurements of soil thermal
   conductivity, taken every few minutes during the first hour and once
   per hour thereafter, atmospheric pressure measurements taken once per
   hour, and a water detection experiment designed to sense the presence
   of ice and hydrated minerals. Go to TOC L.8 8/8/97 LANDER PAYLOAD -

   5.1.4 Lander Payload - Mars Volatiles and Climate Surveyor [MVACS]
   MVACS is an integrated payload with four major science elements: a
   Stereo Surface Imager, a Robotic Arm with Camera, a Meteorological
   package of pressure, temperature, wind, and water vapor sensors, and a
   Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer. Dr. David Paige (UCLA) is the
   Principal Investigator for the MVACS. Stereo Surface Imager (SSI): The
   mast-mounted SSI provides panoramas of the Lander site, characterizes
   the general environment at the landing site, and provides imaging
   support for other payload elements, especially operations of the RA and
   TEGA, and for the spacecraft, as needed. The SSI is essentially a clone
   of the Mars Pathfinder IMP; it is a multi-spectral imager accessing
   several wavelengths between 0.4 and 1.1 microns. This multi-spectral
   capability, together with onboard calibration targets, provides true
   color images. SSI also images magnetic targets on the Lander deck to
   characterize the magnetic properties of surface material. Narrow-band
   imaging of the sun provides line-of-sight optical depths of atmospheric
   aerosols and (slant column) water vapor abundances. Stereo imaging is
   provided by the dual optical lens systems focusing onto a single CCD.
   Robotic Arm (RA); Robotic Arm Camera (RAC): A two-meter RA with an
   articulated end member is used to dig trenches at the site, to acquire
   samples of surface and subsurface materials, and to support operations
   of an attached RA Camera. The RAC will image the surface and subsurface
   at close range to reveal fine-scale layering if present and to
   characterize the fine-scale texture of the samples and trench sides.
   The light-weight RA also supports a probe for measuring surface and
   subsurface temperatures. Meteorological Package (MET): Mounted on a
   1.2-m mast, the MET package includes a wind (speed and direction)
   sensor, several temperature sensors, and Tunable Diode Lasers (TDL)
   which measure water vapor amounts and specific isotopes of water and
   carbon dioxide. A secondary mast (0.9 m in length) is attached to the
   main MET mast, and supports a wind speed and two temperature sensors
   near the surface saltation layer. Pressure sensors are mounted within
   the spacecraft. Once on the surface the MET sensors are read at
   periodic intervals, as power permits. Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer
   (TEGA): TEGA uses differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) combined with
   gas-specific sensors to determine the concentrations of ices, adsorbed
   volatiles and volatile-bearing minerals in surface and subsurface
   samples acquired and imaged by the Robotic Arm (RA). The RA deposits
   the sample on a grated screen over a chute which fills the sample
   receptacle. This receptacle is then mated with a cover to form the oven
   in which the sample is heated; a paired (empty) oven provides a
   calibration for the heating run. Evolved gases are wafted to sensors
   which quantify the rate of discharge of oxygen, carbon dioxide and
   water vapor. Once used, the ovens cannot be used again. TEGA is
   designed to receive eight surface (soil) samples during the Lander
   mission. Go to TOC L.10 8/8/97 LANDER PAYLOAD - MARS VOLATILES AND

   surface [soil] samples can be analyzed. L.11 8/8/97 5.2 LANDER MISSION
   OVERVIEW 5.2.1 Overall Mission Description The MSP 98 Lander will be
   launched on a Delta 7425 in January 1999, and will arrive at Mars in
   December 1999. Burnout of the 3rd stage will be followed by yo-yo
   despin of the entire stack, followed by spacecraft separation. At this
   point both the spacecraft and upper stage will have been injected onto
   a Type 2 trajectory whose aimpoint is biased away from the nominal
   entry aimpoint, to assure that the upper stage has less than a 1E-4
   probabilty of impacting Mars, as required by Planetary Protection
   regulations. After separation, the solar panels will be deployed and
   pointed to the sun, and initial acquisition achieved by the DSN.
   Throughout cruise, contact will be maintained via the Medium Gain
   Antenna. The solar panels will be pointed at the sun [with a small
   offset in inner cruise]. Approximately 15 days after launch, the
   largest Trajectory Correction Maneuver [TCM-1] will be executed. This
   maneuver will remove launch vehicle injection errors and the
   spacecraft's injection aimpoint bias. Depending on the size of the
   maneuver, it may be necessary to divide this into two smaller
   maneuvers. Provisions have been made to execute up to 3 additional
   small TCM's during the remainder of cruise, plus a contingency 5th TCM
   seven hours prior to entry for final control of the entry angle and
   landing footprint, if needed. Precision approach navigation will be
   effected via near simultaneous tracking of the approaching Lander and
   an orbiter at Mars [either the MSP98 Orbiter or MGS]. After a direct
   atmospheric entry, the Lander will be slowed by a Mars
   Pathfinder-heritage aeroshell and parachute, and a controlled
   propulsive landing effected. For launch during the Lander's primary
   launch period, landing will occur between 75 and 78 S, on the southern
   polar layered terrain. The first landed day's activities will include
   deployment of the solar panels, functional checkout, and establishment
   of communication with the Orbiter and time critical science activities.
   Routine science activities will commence, at the earliest, on the
   second day following landing. The Lander will be equipped with a UHF
   relay for downlink via the MSP98 Orbiter and/or MGS, and command uplink
   via the MSP98 Orbiter. A direct to Earth [DTE] link will also be
   available for Lander commanding and as a backup downlink. The Lander
   will carry the Mars Volatiles and Climate Surveyor (MVACS) instrument
   suite, which will perform in situ investigations to address the science
   theme "Volatiles and Climate History", the Mars Descent Imager (MARDI),
   and a LIDAR instrument supplied by the Russian Space Agency. The Lander
   will search for near-surface ice and possible surface records of cyclic
   climate change, and characterize physical processes key to the seasonal
   cycles of water, carbon dioxide and dust on Mars. The duration of the
   landed science phase is expected to last no more than approximately 90
   days. Go to TOC L.12 8/8/97 OVERALL MISSION DESCRIPTION Cruise * 5

   through liftoff. The Boost and s/c Initialization Phase covers Liftoff
   until initial DSN contact. Cruise Phase: The cruise phase extends from
   spacecraft initialization to Entry - 30 hours. It includes initial
   checkout of the spacecraft, required trajectory correction maneuvers
   (TCMs) and calibrations, and initiation of the pre-entry episode.
   Entry, Descent, and Landing Phase: The entry, descent, and landing
   [EDL] phase extends from Entry - 30 hours until cutoff of the descent
   engines. Landed Operations Phase: The landed operations phase extends
   from descent engine cutoff through the end of science data taking.
   Phase duration will be a function of lander capabilities. Go to TOC

   lander capabilities L.15 8/8/97 5.2.3 Lander Launch/Arrival Period *
   This page under Change Control * The MSP98 Lander launch period is
   divided into an 8 day Primary period [1/3/99 - 1/10/99] followed by a 6
   day Secondary launch period [1/11/99 - 1/16/99]. A Contingency launch
   period [1/17/99-1/27/99] is also supported. All lander trajectories are
   Type 2, which allow high southern latitude accessibility during
   southern Spring. Additional information on trajectory states can be
   found in Appendix B.1 - Lander Mission Database. Lander design,
   including ablator thickness and thermal design, and propellant loads
   are based on conditions during the Primary launch/arrival period. The
   Secondary and Contingency intervals are characterized by reduced
   probabilities of achieving mission goals, including site elevation
   requirements. Primary Launch Period [1/3/99 - 1/10/99]: The choice of
   the Lander's Primary launch interval is based on a number of factors.
   In order to avoid conflict with the Orbiter launch, the start of the
   Lander launch period must occur no earlier than January 2, 1999. In
   addition, the arrival date must be no earlier than December 3, 1999,
   which corresponds to a solar longitude [Ls] of 256 . This is the
   earliest arrival consistent with Lander survival and operation in the
   thermal environment expected at the high Southern landing latitudes.
   The date for the open of the Primary launch period which satisfies
   these requirements and also keeps the launch energy [C3] acceptably low
   is January 3, 1999. Across the 8 day primary period, the arrival date
   is kept fixed, primarily to keep arrival V low for improved approach
   navigation accuracy. A fixed arrival date also simplifies Lander
   operations planning. With this stategy, the maximum C3 and V for the
   Primary interval both occur on the first day of the Launch period. The
   history of the Delta launch vehicle indicates that a high probability
   [approximately 98% or higher] exists that launch will occur during the
   Primary interval. Entry Angle and Landing Latitude: For a flight path
   angle of -13.25 , the nominal landing latitude is approximately 76 S at
   the start of the Primary launch period, and 75 S at the end of Primary.
   The Landing footprint is approximately ± 1.5 for an entry angle
   corridor of 0.45 [3 ]. [See B.1, the Lander Mission Database for more
   data.] The probability of staying within the required entry angle
   corridor of ±0.25 is TBD for the Primary launch period. The range of
   acceptable longitudes is approximately 170 W - 235 W, corresponding to
   ice- free conditions at the landing latitude. For planning purposes,
   the nominal landing latitude is assumed to be 210 W. Secondary Launch
   Period [1/11/99 - 1/16/99]: During the 6 day Secondary period which
   follows the Primary interval, the nominal launch/arrival strategy is to
   follow a contour of constant latitude, to maintain approximately the
   same lattitude access available at the end of the Primary interval. As
   the following graphic illustrates, by the latter half of the Secondary
   launch period, the arrival V will start exceeding the maximum V
   encountered during the Primary interval. This will tend to degrade
   approach navigation accuracy [leading to larger landing ellipses] and
   lead to higher heat loads. For launches towards the very end of the
   Secondary period, it may become necessary to sacrifice latitude access
   in order to keep heating loads within limits. Contingency Launch Period
   [1/17/99 - 1/27/99]: Launch beyond the end of the Secondary period is
   feasible, by following a launch/arrival strategy which does not
   increase arrival V beyond the limit imposed by the ablator thickness.
   As the following graph indicates, this leads to landing sites at more
   Northern latitudes. Go to TOC L.16 8/8/97 LANDER LAUNCH/ARRIVAL PERIOD

   Shown on the following 3 pages is a text summary of the timing of major
   mission events and associated DSN tracking requirements. Summaries are
   provided for the open and close of the Primary Launch Period, and the
   end of the Secondary Launch Period. 34m HEF antennae are baselined
   throughout, although limited use of the 34m BWG is feasible and
   required for some portions of the mission, to accommodate DSN usage
   conflicts. In addition, some modification of the nominal tracking
   profile is occasionally required in order to accommodate conflicts with
   other missions using the same DSN assets. Expected BWG use and
   modifications to nominal tracking schedules is detailed in Appendix
   B.8. The 70m net is also being requested for Entry±5 days. [Note: 70m
   support is also being requested for the Orbiter during the entire
   Lander surface mission.] Go to TOC L.18 8/8/97 Lander Open Primary

   * L.21 8/8/97 5.2.5 Lander V and Propellant Mass Summary * This page
   under Change Control * Propellant required by the Lander during its
   mission life has been calculated using end-to-end Monte Carlo
   simulations. Propellant loading is based on accommodating 99% of the
   simulated cases for the start of the launch period, which has the
   highest arrival V across the primary. The maximum Lander wet mass is
   assumed to be 615 kg, based on the maximum allowable entry mass and the
   requirement to carry the New Millenium microprobes. The site elevation
   goal is 5 km ± 1 km uncertainty. Analysis: A high fidelity Monte Carlo
   simulation has been used to determine propellant needs for the Lander.
   This simulation uses 2000 approach states and entry masses as inputs.
   These data include dispersions in the approach state due to various
   error sources, including orbit determination, maneuver execution, and V
   imparted by attitude thrusters. Entry dispersions due to uncertainties
   and variability in the atmosphere are modeled using the statistical
   model in MarsGRAM 3.4, with inputs tailored to simulate more accurate
   GCM atmosphere profiles. A wind profile [source: R. Zurek] where
   maximum windspeed is a function of altitude is also modeled. The
   mgnitude of the wind is selected randomly and held constant for each
   case in the simulation. Entry aerodynamics, including angle of attack,
   are modeled as well. The clock angle and magnitude of the angle of
   attack [within a ±1 envelope] are selected randomly and held constant
   for each case. Other modeled effects include IMU errors, errors in
   propagation of the onboard navigation state, variability in
   characteristics of the terminal descent propulsion system, and radar
   errors. The following table summarizes V and mass drop data for the

   L.29 8/8/97 5.4 LANDER CRUISE PHASE 5.4.1 Lander Cruise Navigation *
   This page under Change Control* Radiometric tracking requirements
   during cruise involve the use of two way coherent doppler and ranging
   according to the schedule described in the following table. As
   indicated, for the first 30 days after launch a minimum of one 4 hour
   pass per day is required. During quiescent cruise, only one 4 hour pass
   per DSN complex per week is required for radiometric tracking. [One
   4-hour DSN track is baselined per day for purposes of spacecraft
   monitoring.] For TCM's 1 - 3, one 4 hour pass per day would be required
   during a 7 day interval centered about the TCM. For the track occuring
   during the 24 hour interval centered at TCM, the entire pass must be
   visible from a single DSN station. [Note: The analysis described in
   Appendix B.7 assumed 3 4-hr passes per day during the 24 hours centered
   on each TCM. Subsequent analyses confirm that a single 4-hr pass is
   sufficient.] Pre-Entry Tracking - Near Simultaneous Orbiter/Lander
   Tracking: Additional tracking is required for the 45 days prior to
   Entry; during this time, approximately three 4-hour passes per day are
   required for the higher precision navigation required prior to Entry.
   TBD: In addition, in order to improve entry angle control, a program of
   near-simultaneous tracking between the Lander and an orbiter at Mars
   [either the MSP98 Orbiter or MGS] is required starting 30 days before
   Entry. This technique reduces the effects of error sources common to
   both spacecraft, such as station-dependant biases, Earth orientation
   errors, and errors in media and solar plasma modelling. Lander tracks
   would immediately precede or follow an orbiter track from the same HEF
   antenna. During much of this interval, the Lander would enjoy greater
   flexibility in scheduling its tracks, compared with an orbiter,
   especially the MSP98 Orbiter, which would be in Aerobraking at this
   time. As a result, the Lander tracks would have to be scheduled to fit
   in with the Orbiter tracks, while satisfying the Lander transmitter
   on/off cycle [4 hrs on/5 hrs off during cruise]. The baseline assumes
   use of the MSP98 Orbiter. MGS would be used as a backup in case the
   MSP98 Orbiter is not available. A strawman integrated tracking schedule
   and estimate of D/L data volume can be found in Appendix B.9. 5.4.2
   TCM's * This page under Change Control* Although the Lander trajectory
   does not require any deterministic deep space maneuvers to reach Mars,
   statistical Trajectory Correction Maneuvers [TCM's] are required to
   shape the cruise trajectory. Up to five TCM's are planned to occur, at
   Launch + 15 days, Launch + 30 days, Entry - 60 days, Entry - 4 days,
   and a contingency maneuver at Entry - 7 hours. At injection, the
   probability of impact of the upper stage is less than 1E-4, as required
   by Planetary Protection regulations. [See the MGS Planetary Protection
   Plan.] It is not necessary to bias the injection aimpoint away from the
   nominal to satisfy this requirement. As a result, the primary purpose
   for TCM-1 is to correct injection errors. TCM-1 constitutes 98% of the
   total TCM V required during a mission, and will be broken into two
   maneuvers, separated by a repressurization interval, if the required
   value of TCM-1 is greater than 24 m/s. The following page includes a
   table of the 95% high, mean, and 95% low values of each TCM and the
   summary statistical V for the beginning of the Primary launch period.
   Propellant loading is based on an end-to-end Monte Carlo analysis of
   propellant usage, including the effects of maneuver execution errors
   and orbit determination errors. Go to TOC L.30 8/8/97 LANDER CRUISE

   5.4.4 Lander Payload Cruise Checkout, Characterization, and Calibration
   Campaigns 5.4.4.1 Overview Constraints: Checkouts and calibrations of
   the Lander instruments must be de-conflicted with Lander and Orbiter
   mission-critical events. No science checkouts, calibrations, or
   playback of data will be performed within ±3 days of a Lander TCM or
   within 45 days of Entry, consistent with Lander power limitations. None
   of the Lander science cruise calibrations affect the orientation of the
   spacecraft. Checkout, Characterization, and Calibration Campaigns: A
   single sequence will perform all required science checkouts and
   calibrations. This sequence will run twice, at approximately Launch +
   40 days and Entry - 90 days. Each campaign will last 7 days, during
   which all payload checkout and calibration activities, and playback of
   all data will be performed. 70m tracking support will be requested for
   these intervals, allowing the lander to communicate at a D/L da
