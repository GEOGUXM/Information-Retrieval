                         SSCWeb Popularity Increases
                 __________________________________________

   Use of the Satellite Situation Center (SSC) Web (SSCWeb) system
   continues steady growth since its operational start in late September
   1996.

                         Graph of SSCWeb Statistics

   On the color chart, monthly SSCWeb usage divided among the three
   primary functions supported, namely:
     * Conjunction Queries
     * Spacecraft Position Plots
     * Spacecraft Position Listings

   The numbers graphed represent actual executions of the system
   delivering products. For easier comparison to the statistics of other
   Web-based services, the total number of Web page "hits" on the system
   by month is also shown (normalized to a 1/10th scale).

   SSCWeb is an effort of the Space Physics Data Facility - (SPDF),
