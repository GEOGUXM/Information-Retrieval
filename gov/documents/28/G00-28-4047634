Welcome to the Open Architecture Control Web Site. This site is a resource
for users, vendors, and third parties interested in open architecture
control.
Through NIST's Intelligent Open Architecture Control of Manufacturing Systems
and Research and Engineering of Intelligent Systems programs, we are
supporting the discrete parts manufacturing industry's efforts to reduce
automation equipment integration costs through interoperability standards. We
do this by participating in standards validation efforts with industry user
groups,focusing on measurements and testbedding that are part of NIST's core
mission. By working together with industry groups, we hope to make a
significant impact in reducing integration costs and enabling the seamless
integration of design and production.
