Building and Fire Research Laboratory

                         Building Environment Division
       _______________________________________________________________

     The Building Environment Division reduces the cost of designing and
     operating buildings and increases the international competitiveness
     of the U.S. building industry by providing modeling, measurement,
     and test methods needed to use advanced computation and automation
     effectively in construction, to improve the quality of the indoor
     environment, and to improve the performance of building equipment
     and systems.

     The Building Environment Division conducts laboratory, field, and
     analytical research on building mechanical and control systems;
     develops data, measurement methods and modeling techniques for the
     performance of the building envelope, its insulation systems,
     building air leakage, and the release, movement and absorption of
     indoor air pollutants, and develops standard communication protocols
     for building management systems and performance criteria, interface
     standards, and test methods for the Nation's building industry to
     make effective use of modern computer-aided design hardware and
     software and database management systems.

     The Building Environment Division began a Green Building Research
     and Demonstration Program in 1994. As part of that program, grants
     were given to Montana State University to evaluate a variety of
     "green technologies" that could be incorporated into the design and
     construction of a new classroom/laboratory building for the campus.
     The building is now under design and described in detail on the
     linked page.

  Enhanced Building Performance
  Research Programs

     Most of the Division's research is carried out in two main programs:
    1. Healthy and Sustainable Buildings
    2. Cybernetic Building Systems

     Both programs benefit from collaborations with other BFRL divisions,
     divisions in other NIST laboratories, industry sponsors, and other
     government agencies. The objectives of these programs are:
     * Healthy and Sustainable Buildings -- To develop measurement
       methods, test methods, fundamental data, simulation models, and
       life cycle environmental and economic analysis tools to support the
       wide-spread use of sustainability in design, construction,
       operation, and demolition of buildings and their
       systems/subsystems.

     * Cybernetic Building Systems -- in partnership with industry, to
       develop, demonstrate, disseminate, and assist with implementation
       of a computer-integrated knowledge system, HYPERCON, including
       validating multi-attribute simulation models for prediction and
       optimization of concrete performance taking into account life-cycle
       costs and environmental impact.

  Indoor Air Quality and Ventilation Group

     This group develops computer simulation programs and measurement
     procedures to better understand air and contaminant transport
     phenomena in buildings. The results of this research are providing
     valuable methods to evaluate ventilation characteristics and indoor
     pollutant concentrations in buildings.

  Thermal Machinery Group

     This group identifies and characterizes new atmospheric-safe
     refrigerants and refrigerant mixtures that contribute to
     energy-efficient refrigerant applications. It also evaluates
     alternative refrigerant cycles, systems, and components that will
     operate efficiently with new refrigerants.

  Heat Transfer and Alternative Energy Systems Group

     This group is responsible for three major research activities:
     providing thermal conductivity measurement services and standard
     reference materials to the thermal insulation industry; development
     of methods of test for residential heat pumps, air conditioners, and
     water heaters; and development of methods of test, measurement
     techniques, and predictive performance models for Building
     Integrated Photovoltaics. The group is also attempting to develop an
     innovative moisture sensing technology for the building community.

  Mechanical Systems and Controls Group

     This group improves and lowers the cost of building services by
     fostering the development and use of more intelligent, integrated,
     and optimized building mechanical systems and controls. It also
     develops standard communication protocols for exchanging information
     between building management and control systems.

  Computer-Integrated Construction Group

     This group reduces the cost and improves the quality of facility
     engineering, construction, and operation processes by developing and
     testing open standards for the representation, exchange, and sharing
     of information throughout the facility life cycle. The current focus
     of the group is on the use of open information standards in
     collaborative processes, such as ISO/STEP, ISO/VRML, and the
     International Alliance for Interoperability Industry Foundation
     Classes.
