   This issue of the Computing Division Newsletter is dedicated to a
   discussion of how the Linux operating system will be supported at
   Fermilab on computers based on the Intel Pentium family of
   microprocessors. [In this document, the term Intel PC refers to Intel
   Pentium processors.] We have tried to position Fermilab to take
   advantage of powerful, cost effective computing solutions at all scales
   -- from desktop systems to very large multiprocessor compute servers.
   We have emphasized RISC-based computers running Unix for data analysis
   and scientific computing and Intel systems running Windows NT for
   general administrative, technical, and (some) scientific computing.
   Over the last few years, Intel Pentium chips have increased in power
   and dropped in cost, and they now also have become cost effective
   solutions for data analysis. For a little over a year, we have been
   working on porting and testing the standard HEP programs and tools to
   Linux on these systems. We began with Linux rather than Windows NT
   because it is very close to our standard Unix environment. We now feel
   confident that we can support Linux for use in processor farms for
   event reconstruction and simulation, for Level III triggering, and for
   desktop scientific computing.

   At present, we are not fully prepared to support Windows NT to carry
   out these tasks, but we do plan to begin a serious study of what is
   involved. A limited step in this direction is support for the Windows
   NT Microsoft Visual C++ combination in the Fermilab Physics Class
   Library. We are especially interested in understanding what role NT
   could play in the final analysis phases (e.g., PAW) and whether
   commercial analysis packages could be of value to us. We will report to
   you on our progress periodically over the next year or so.
