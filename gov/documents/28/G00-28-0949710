         The ultra-high pressure neutron diffractometer under development for
         the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory will
         allow studies of a variety of powdered and single crystal samples under
         extreme conditions of pressure and temperature. The increased neutron
         flux coupled with development of large volume pressure cells utilizing
         large synthetic single crystal opposed anvils will allow significant
         advances in the pressure range accessible to neutron diffraction. The
         pressure goal is > 100 GPa on ~1 mm^3 sample on a routine basis. In
         addition, recent advances in next generation micro detectors will allow
         the incident beam focusing optics, pressure chamber and detector array
         to be highly integrated, thus providing a highly flexible facility for
         materials studies under extreme conditions.

         The instrument scientist who is responsible for the design and
         construction of this instrument is Chris Tulk.
