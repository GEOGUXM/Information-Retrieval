   The  Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM) I instrument
   was the first to clearly demonstrate that the total radiant energy from
   the sun was not a constant. ACRIM III instrument for EOS is designed to
   extend the time series of TSI (total solar irradiance) observations by
   ACRIM I on SMM (Solar Maximum Mission) satellite and ACRIM II on UARS
   (Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite). ACRIM III is an improved,
   miniaturized version of the instrument flown on UARS, weighing only
   one-half as much. ACRIM III is expected to monitor TSI with an accuracy
   within 0,1%, and a long-term precision of 5ppm per year. The platform
   is spin stabilized with the instrument's solar viewing axis aligned
   with the center of the solar disk within 0.25 degrees. Each sampling
   interval is approximately 2 minutes, with ~55 minutes of sun viewing
   period per orbit.

   MISSION OBJECTIVE:


   [bull.gif]

   ACRIM III science objectives are in the fields of climatology and solar
   physics.
   [bull.gif]

   Maintain and extend the long time-series database of TSI accumulated by
   Nimbus 7/ERB, SMM/ACRIM I, UARS/ACRIM II. Perpetuate the high precision
   of the data necessary to "see" the solar variability.
