                             General Information

                              [rrnewline22.jpg]
     * Located in the Consolidated Information Center of the Washington
       State University/Tri-Cities Branch Campus, along with the Hanford
       Technical Library.

     * Open Monday through Friday from 10am until 5pm (Pacific Standard
       Time).  Staff is available during these hours to assist patrons in
       utilizing the collection.

     * A photocopier and microfiche reader/printer are available for
       making copies.  If extra copies are on hand, these are given away
       at no charge.  If a copy needs to be made, a duplication fee of 10
       cents per page is charged.  It is the Reading Room's policy to
       require payment in advance before sending out copies of any
       document.

     * Public access computers are provided for searching the Internet for
       Hanford and Department of Energy (DOE) related information.

     * The collection contains over 40,000 items.  These are primarily
       technical and administrative reports created by DOE and its
       contractors from the 1943 founding of the Hanford Site to the
       present.  The Reading Room does NOT contain every report ever
       written at Hanford, but the staff is happy to assist users in
       trying to locate Hanford publicly available documents not in the
       Reading Room.

     * Materials in the Reading Room collection do not circulate - they
       cannot be checked out or borrowed through Interlibrary Loan.

     * The Reading Room does not subscribe to any journals but it does
       receive several DOE-related newsletters.

     * The Richland Reading Room was established in 1976.  It is one of
       approximately 20 DOE Public Reading Rooms throughout the country,
       which are usually located in communities near major DOE facilities.
