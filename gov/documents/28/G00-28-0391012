                             Offender Screening

   The Offender Screening Section encompasses both the Sexually Violent
   Predator (SVP) and Mentally Disordered Offender (MDO)  programs.

   The SVP unit screens the conviction histories of sex offenders who have
   been convicted of specific sex offenses. Those individuals who meet
   program criteria are referred to the State Department of Mental Health
   for clinical evaluations and eventual referral to county district
   attorneys. District attorneys may file petitions for civil commitment,
   and those individuals who are committed are referred to a psychiatric
   facility to receive counseling and treatment specifically addressing
   their predatory sexual tendencies.

   The MDO program requires mental health treatment by the state
   Department of Mental Health as a special condition of parole for
   parolees suffering from severe mental disorders. The board imposes the
   special parole condition on prisoners who have been determined, through
   clinical evaluations and court document review, to pose a substantial
   danger to others due to a severe mental disorder. If all statutory are
   met, the prisoner may be placed in this Department of Mental Health
   treatment program upon parole.
