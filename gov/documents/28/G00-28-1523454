   What is the NIOSHTIC® Database: A bibliographic database of literature
   in the field of occupational safety and health. About 160 current,
   English language technical journals provide approximately 35 percent of
   the additions to NIOSHTIC® annually. Retrospective information, some of
   which is from the 19th century, is also acquired and entered.

   Because NIOSH examines all aspects of adverse effects experienced by
   workers, much of the information contained in NIOSHTIC® has been
   selected from sources that do not have a primary occupational safety
   and health orientation.

   Who Should Access the NIOSHTIC® Database:
   Anyone needing up-to-date information on the subject of occupational
   safety and health.

   Use NIOSHTIC® to access:
     * Content specifically focused on issues pertaining to occupational
       safety and health.
     * Technical articles from over 4,000 sources including approximately
       160 core journals.
     * Information from proceedings of scientific meetings and symposia.
     * Almost 200,000 records with 6,000 new records added each year.
     * Records which include CAS Numbers; SIC Codes and CODEN for improved
       searching.
     * Translations of non-English occupational safety and health articles
       acquired by NIOSH.

   NIOSHTIC® Subject Coverage Includes:
     * behavioral sciences
     * biochemistry, physiology and metabolism
