   STANDARDS OVERVIEW Juveniles who commit criminal offenses in Washington
   are subject to the provisions of RCW Chapter 13.40, Juvenile Justice
   Act of 1977, as amended. The Act contains guidelines and procedures for
   the imposition of sentences, "dispositions," and is based on a
   determinate sentencing model which prescribes presumptive sanctions
   commensurate with the offender's age, seriousness of the current
   offense and prior criminal history. When a court finds that a
   presumptive sanction would amount to an excessive penalty, or that the
   juvenile presents a serious and clear danger to society, it may impose
   a disposition which departs from the presumptive standard range. Before
   imposing a sentence outside of the presumptive standard range, the
   court must be persuaded by clear and convincing evidence that certain
   requirements are met. The goal of a determinate sentencing system is to
   ensure that offenders who commit similar crimes and who have similar
   criminal histories receive substantially similar sentences. Presumptive
   sentencing schedules are structured so that offenses involving greater
   harm to a victim and to society result in greater punishment. The
   disposition standards in Washington apply equally to juvenile offenders
   in all parts of the state, without discrimination as to any element
   that does not relate to the crime or to the juvenile's previous record.
   Pursuant to RCW 9.94A.040 and 13.40.005, it is the responsibility of
   the Sentencing Guidelines Commission to review the juvenile disposition
   standards and to recommend revisions or modifications of those
   standards to the Legislature. The Commission also evaluates the
   application of standards and juvenile justice policies and conducts
   ongoing research on juvenile dispositions. The Commission reports to
   the Governor and the Legislature on racial and ethnic disparities in
   juvenile dispositions, the capacity of state and local juvenile
   facilities and resources, and on juvenile recidivism. In order to
   advise the Legislature, the Commission requires accurate information on
   juvenile offenders, their crimes and the dispositions imposed under the
   Juvenile Justice Act. This information is derived from copies of
   disposition documents sent by the court clerks to the Commission office
   and is converted into a computerized database. The Commission produces
   descriptive information on juvenile dispositions and analyzes the
   impacts of changes to the disposition standards on juvenile offender
   populations remanded to county detention centers and state Juvenile
   Rehabilitation Administration institutions. Juvenile Disposition Manual
   2000 1 INSTRUCTIONS The following procedures illustrate the process for
   determining dispositions in cases involving juveniles. Juvenile
   disposition standards reflect comprehensive changes enacted by the 1997
   Legislature and apply to offenses committed on or after July 1, 1998.1
   Determining the Appropriate Court of Jurisdiction Before any court
   action is initiated against a juvenile, a determination must be made as
   to the proper court. Generally, the juvenile court has original
   jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed by juveniles 17 years of
   age or younger (See RCW 13.04.030, 13.40.110). Exceptions to this
   general rule apply in certain, well defined and clearly delineated
   cases. First, adult criminal courts exercise exclusive original
   jurisdiction over juvenile offenders who are 16 or 17 years old and
   whose alleged offense is: (A) A serious violent offense, as defined in
   RCW 9.94A.030; (B) A violent offense, as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, and
   has a juvenile criminal history consisting of: (i) one or more prior
   serious violent offenses; (ii) two or more prior violent offenses; or
   (iii) three or more of any combination of the following offenses: any
   Class A felony, any Class B felony, Vehicular Assault, or Manslaughter
   in the Second Degree, all of which must have been committed after the
   juvenile's thirteenth birthday and prosecuted separately; (C) Robbery
   in the First Degree, Rape of a Child in the First Degree, or Drive-by
   Shooting committed on or after July 1, 1997; (D) Burglary in the First
   Degree committed on or after July 1, 1997, and the juvenile has a
   criminal history consisting of one or more prior felony or misdemeanor
   offenses; or (E) Any violent offense, as defined in RCW 9.94A.030,
   committed on or after July 1, 1997, and the juvenile is alleged to have
   been armed with a firearm. The adult criminal court may also assert
   jurisdiction over juveniles when the juvenile court exercises its
   discretion to decline jurisdiction. Unless expressly waived by the
   juvenile court, a "decline" hearing must be held in the following
   cases: (A) The juvenile is 15, 16, or 17 years old and the alleged
   conduct (offense) constitutes a Class A felony 2 or an attempt,
   solicitation, or conspiracy to commit a Class A felony; (B) The
   juvenile is 17 years old and the alleged offense is any of the
   following: Assault in the Second Degree; Child Molestation in the
   Second Degree; Extortion in the First 1 Chapter 338, Laws of 1997. 2
   The amendment of charges to offenses not within the jurisdiction of
   adult courts requires the adult court to relinquish jurisdiction over
   the juvenile. See State v. Mora, 138 Wn..2d 43 (1999). 2 Juvenile
   Disposition Manual 2000 Degree; Indecent Liberties; Kidnapping in the
   Second Degree; or Robbery in the Second Degree; or (C) Any juvenile and
   the alleged offense is Escape and the juvenile is serving a minimum
   juvenile sentence to age twenty-one (21). Determining the Standard
   Range for Juvenile Dispositions In cases where the juvenile falls
   within the jurisdiction of juvenile court, the following factors should
   be considered in determining an appropriate disposition: (1) The
   offense category of the current offense(s); (2) The number of prior
   adjudications; and (3) The point of intersection of the Current Offense
   Category row and the Prior Adjudications column on the juvenile
   disposition "grid" to identify the appropriate cell. Offense Category
   Most juvenile offenses are categorized in RCW 13.40.0357. Offenses not
   listed in that section of the code may be determined by converting
   adult offense classifications into juvenile offense categories in the
   following manner: Adult Offense Juvenile Completed Offense Juvenile
   Anticipatory Offense Class A felony Offense Category A Offense Category
   B+ Class B felony Offense Category B Offense Category C Class C felony
   Offense Category C Offense Category D Gross Misdemeanor Offense
   Category D Offense Category E Misdemeanor Offense Category E Offense
   Category E Violations Offense Category V Offense Category V Two
   statutorily recognized exceptions to this method of categorizing
   offenses should be noted. (1) All violations of the Uniform Controlled
   Substances Act (RCW 69.50), both completed and anticipatory, are
   assigned to the same offense category. (2) Escape in the First and
   Second Degrees and Attempted Escape in the First and Second Degrees
   fall within Category C offenses, but require their own standard range
   confinement terms, as follows: * First escape or attempted escape
   during a 12-month period: four (4) weeks confinement; * Second escape
   or attempted escape during a 12-month period: eight (8) weeks
   confinement; * Third and subsequent escape or attempted escape during a
   12-month period: twelve (12) weeks confinement. Juvenile Disposition
   Manual 2000 3 Prior Adjudications "Adjudication" has the same meaning
   as "conviction" in RCW 9.94A.030 of the Sentencing Reform Act. The
   terms must be construed identically and may be used interchangeably.
   See RCW 13.04.011(1). Prior felony adjudications count as one point
   each on the juvenile disposition grid. Each prior violation,
   misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor adjudication counts as ¼ point
   (fractions are rounded down). Non-felony offenses (i.e., misdemeanors
   and gross misdemeanors) generally include all Category D and E
   offenses. A "violation" may include any act or omission, which if
   committed by an adult, must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and is
   punishable by sanctions that do not include incarceration (See RCW
   13.40.020). A prior offense does not count for any points in the
   juvenile's criminal history "score" if the adjudication of the prior
   offense occurred after the alleged commission of the current offense.
   Current offenses do not count for any points in the juvenile's criminal
   history "score." If a juvenile is convicted of two or more charges
   arising out of the same course of conduct, only the highest charge is
   counted in the juvenile's criminal history "score." Diversion
   agreements under RCW 13.40.080 do not count for any points in the
   juvenile's criminal history "score," although diversions do appear in a
   juvenile's criminal record. See Juvenile Court Rule 7.12 and RCW
   13.40.020(7)(b). A successfully completed deferred adjudication entered
   before July 1, 1998, as well as a successfully completed deferred
   disposition, may not be considered part of the juvenile's criminal
   record. Appropriate Cell in the Juvenile Disposition Grid To find the
   appropriate standard range disposition for a particular offense, find
   the intersection of the proper "Current Offense Category" row and the
   proper "Prior Adjudications" column. The sentences for multiple current
   offenses are served consecutively by the offender (See RCW 13.40.180).
   Confinement is discretionary with the court when the standard
   disposition falls into a "Local Sanctions" cell. Select one of the
   available disposition options from the following Juvenile Offender

   1 2 3 4 or More Prior Adjudications (1) The vertical axis of the grid
   is the current offense category. The current offense category is
   determined by the offense of adjudication. (2) The horizontal axis of
   the grid is the number of prior adjudications included in the
   juvenile's criminal history. Each prior felony adjudication counts as
   one point. Each prior violation, misdemeanor, and gross misdemeanor
   adjudication counts as 1/4 point. Fractional points are rounded down.
   (3) The standard range disposition for each offense is determined by
   the intersection of the column defined by the prior adjudications and
   the row defined by the current offense category. (4) RCW 13.40.180
   applies if the offenders is being sentenced for more than one offense.
   (5) A current offense that is a violation is equivalent to an offense
   category of E. However, a disposition for a violation shall not include
   confinement. LS = Local Sanctions: 0 - 30 Days of Confinement, and/or 0
   - 12 Months of Community Supervision, and/or 0 - 150 Hours of Community
   Service, and/or $0 - $500 Fine Juvenile Disposition Manual 2000 5
   OPTION B: CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY DISPOSITION ALTERNATIVE (CDDA) If the
   juvenile offender is subject to a standard range disposition of local
   sanctions or 15 to 36 weeks of confinement and has not committed a
   category A- or B+ offense, the court, under a finding that the offender
   is chemically dependent and amenable to treatment, may suspend an
   Option A disposition and impose a disposition outside of the standard
   range. See RCW 13.40.165. The court may place the offender on community
   supervision for one year and, as a condition of the suspended Option A
   disposition, the court: * Must require the offender to undergo
   available inpatient/outpatient drug or alcohol treatment; and * May
   require up to 30 days confinement, 150 hours of community service,
   and/or payment of legal financial obligations and restitution. The
   combination of inpatient treatment and confinement may not exceed 90
   days. The treatment provider must submit monthly progress reports and
   the court may schedule treatment review hearings. The suspension may be
   revoked and the disposition executed (with credit for confinement time
   served on the same offense) for violating conditions or failing to make
   satisfactory progress in treatment. RCW 13.40.165 sets forth all
   provisions related to the CDDA. OPTION C: MANIFEST INJUSTICE If the
   court determines that a disposition under Option A or B would
   effectuate a "Manifest Injustice," the court may impose a disposition
   outside the standard range. See RCW 13.40.160(2). The court's findings
   of a Manifest Injustice must be supported by clear and convincing
   evidence. A disposition outside the standard range must be determinate
   and must be comprised of confinement or community supervision, or a
   combination thereof. A disposition outside the standard range may be
   appealed by the state or by the respondent. When a judge finds a
   Manifest Injustice and imposes a sentence of confinement exceeding 30
   days, the court must sentence the juvenile to a maximum term. When the
   maximum term in the range is ninety days or less, the minimum term in
   the range may be no less than 50% of the maximum term in the range.
   When the maximum term in the range is greater than ninety days but not
   greater than one year, the minimum term in the range may be no less
   than 75% of the maximum term in the range. If the maximum term in the
   range is more than one year, the minimum term in the range may be no
   less than 80% of the maximum term in the range. See RCW 13.40.030(2). 6
   Juvenile Disposition Manual 2000 SPECIAL SEX OFFENDER DISPOSITION
   ALTERNATIVE (SSODA) When a juvenile is found to have committed a sex
   offense, other than a sex offense that is also a serious violent
   offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, and has no history of a prior sex
   offense, the court may order an examination to determine whether the
   offender is amenable to treatment. If, following such an examination,
   the court determines that the offender and the community would benefit
   from the use of the Special Sex Offender Disposition Alternative, the
   court may impose a determinate disposition within the standard range or
   under Option C (manifest injustice) and suspend the execution of the
   disposition and place the offender on community supervision for at
   least two years. As a condition of the suspended disposition, the court
   may impose conditions of community supervision and other conditions,
   including up to thirty days of confinement and requirements that the
   offender do any of the following: * Devote time to a specific
   education, employment, or occupation; * Undergo available outpatient
   sex offender treatment for up to two years, or inpatient treatment sex
   offender treatment not to exceed the standard range of confinement for
   that offense; * Remain within prescribed geographical boundaries and
   notify the court or the probation counselor prior to any change in the
   offender's address, educational program or employment; * Report to the
   prosecutor and the probation counselor prior to any change in a sex
   offender treatment provider (Prior approval by the court is required
   for any change); * Report as directed to the court and a probation
   counselor; * Pay all court-ordered legal financial obligations, perform
   community service, or any combination thereof; * Make restitution to
   the victim for counseling costs reasonably related to the offense; *
   Comply with the conditions of any court-ordered probation bond; or *
   The court shall order that the offender may not attend the public or
   approved private elementary, middle or high school attended by the
   victim or the victim's siblings. A disposition entered under the SSODA
   option may not be appealed. RCW 13.40.160(3) contains a complete
   description of the requirements for imposition of the SSODA sentencing
   option. FIREARM ENHANCEMENTS The 1997 Legislature established an
   enhancement to be applied when a juvenile, or an accomplice, was armed
   with a firearm. The enhancement applies to all felonies except those
   where the use of a firearm is an element of the offense.3 The
   enhancement, which must be served consecutively to the base sentence,
   is six months for a Class A felony, four months for a Class B felony
   and two months for a Class C felony. See RCW 13.40.193. 3 Possession of
   a Machine Gun, Possession of a Stolen Firearm, Drive-by Shooting, Theft
   of a Firearm, Unlawful Possession of a Firearm 1 or 2, or Use of a
   Machine Gun in a Felony. Juvenile Disposition Manual 2000 7 SECTION 2

   (1) This chapter shall be known and cited as the Juvenile Justice Act
   of 1977. (2) It is the intent of the legislature that a system capable
   of having primary responsibility for, being accountable for, and
   responding to the needs of youthful offenders, as defined by this
   chapter, be established. It is the further intent of the legislature
   that youth, in turn, be held accountable for their offenses and that
   communities, families, and the juvenile courts carry out their
   functions consistent with this intent. To effectuate these policies,
   the legislature declares the following to be equally important purposes
   of this chapter: (a) Protect the citizenry from criminal behavior; (b)
   Provide for determining whether accused juveniles have committed
   offenses as defined by this chapter; (c) Make the juvenile offender
   accountable for his or her criminal behavior; (d) Provide for
   punishment commensurate with the age, crime, and criminal history of
   the juvenile offender; (e) Provide due process for juveniles alleged to
   have committed an offense; (f) Provide necessary treatment,
   supervision, and custody for juvenile offenders; (g) Provide for the
   handling of juvenile offenders by communities whenever consistent with
   public safety; (h) Provide for restitution to victims
