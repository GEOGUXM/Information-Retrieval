                                  Overview

   The Units mission is to coordinate specialized teacher recruitment,
   recognition and professional development activities administered by the
   Office of K-16 Initiatives and Access Programs within the State
   Education Department. The newly funded Teachers of Tomorrow grants
   program provides funds for local school districts to recruit and retain
   teachers. The long standing Teacher of the Year and Better Beginnings
   Award programs provide recognition to stellar teachers through
   competitions coordinated within this unit.

   The second component of the units mission is to encourage and support
   the professional development of teachers at the preservice and
   inservice levels. This is accomplished by the awarding of competitive
   grants. The state funded Teacher Opportunity Corps provides funds to
   colleges and universities to offer programs that increase the
   participation rate of historically underrepresented and economically
   disadvantaged individuals in teaching while enhancing their
   preparedness for teaching students at-risk. The Dwight D. Eisenhower
   program provides federal funds to colleges and universities to provide
   Professional Development services in collaboration with high need
   schools or districts.

   Through these programs, the Teacher Recruitment and Development Unit
   serves over 10,000 teachers in school districts throughout the state.
   The unit supports 65 projects in institutions of higher education
   through New York State.

   The programs and initiatives administered by the Teacher Recruitment
   and Development Unit are:
