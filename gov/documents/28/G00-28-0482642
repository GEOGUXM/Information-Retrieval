     __________________________________________________________________

   This page can be considered as a collection of tricks and tips that
   didn't fit well in other pages. Even though the Swiss-PdbViewer is
   quite intuitive, some nice features are more burried. Therefore reading
   this page will transform you in a Swiss-PdbViewer guru.

     * "option" click on a group name (right mouse button on the PC)
       either in the control panel or in the align window will center the
       carbon alpha of the group in the display window. It is quite useful
       if the group was out of screen, and can also be used to rotate the
       molecule around the carbon alpha (see the paragraph about the
       rotation tool ).


     * Hitting the "Help" key or the "=" key ("Insert" key or right mouse
       button for PC users) will automatically move and scale the molecule
       so that all visible groups fit in the view.


     * "Shift" click on any column of the control panel apply the change
       on all groups. For example, shift-click in the "side" column will
       display/undisplay all sidechains, shift click in the "color" column
       will prompt for a new color to apply to all groups...


     * You can go directly to the top or the bottom of the Control Panel,
       Align Window or Text Window with the keyboard "Page-up" and
       "Page-down" keys (nothing exceptionnal here).

     * When slab mode is activated, its position along the Z axis can be
       changed by holding down the shift key while moving the mouse up or
       down. It allows to look at different parts of the protein.


     * It is possible to renumber amino-acids by selecting them and then
       using the "Rename Current Layer" item of the Edit menu. You will be
       asked for a number that will be applied to the first amino-acid
       selected. Next selected amino-acids wil be renumbered accordingly.


     * You can change the dot density in the dialog that allows to change
       the windows caracteristics (size, view angle, and so on).
       Please, note that dot surfaces are recomputed after any operation,
       and it can take time (however, you may interrupt the process any
       time by hitting the "esc" key). The reason I do not store all
       computed points and then rotate them is purely a memory concern
       (some programmers have to take care of the few memory that remains
       once you have opened a word processor and a web browser).
       Note that you can momentaneously prevent all dots surface to be
       drawn even if they are marked "on" in the Control Panel with an
       option of the "Display" menu.

     * Holding the shift key while choosing any of the "Color By" item of
       the display menu will apply changes to all layers.
     * Holding the Control key while choosing any of the "Color By" item
       of the display menu will apply changes to selected groups only.
     * Holding the shift key while selecting an amino-acid in the "Align
       window also selects corresponding aa of other layers.

     * Hitting the "*" key while the mouse is on-top of an aa in the align
       window will browse the rotamer library to select the best
       sidechain.
     * Clicking on an ATOM or HETATM line of a text pdb file will
       automatically center the view on the clicked atom and display only
       groups that are in a 7Ã… sphere around this atom.
     * Clicking on a CRYST1 line of a text pdb file will load the unit
       cell infos (The unit cell is displayed only when the appropriate
       checkbox item of the EDM preferences is enabled).
     * Clicking on a MTRX line of a pdb file will load the matrix
       transformation and will let you apply it on the currently selected
       groups of the current layer.
     * Clicking on a line of a text file containing an uppercase amino
       acid name followed by a number will automatically center the view
       around this residue (provided that such a group exists in the
       current layer). This is very useful to inspect results of whatcheck
       [4].
     * Left and right arrow keys will center the view around the CA of the
       following (or previous) residue when an electron density map is
       loaded.
     * up and down arrow keys will change the sigma contouring value when
       an electron density map is loaded. (for the second contouring
       value, use shift key).
