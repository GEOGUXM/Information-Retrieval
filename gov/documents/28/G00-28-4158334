            ___________________________________________________________

   On March 12, 1928, the sudden failure of St. Francis Dam in Southern
   California resulted in a major disaster. Because of this failure and
   because of the exposure to potential risk to the general populace from
   a number of water storage dams in California, the Legislature in 1929
   enacted legislation providing for supervision over non-federal dams in
   the State. Before the enactment of this legislation, State supervision
   over dams was exercised by either the State Engineer or the State
   Railroad Commission. This supervision was limited in scope and extended
   to less than half of the dams in the State. The statute enacted in 1929
   provided for (1) examination and approval or repair of dams completed
   prior to the effective date of the statute, August 14, 1929; (2)
   approval of plans and specifications, and supervision of construction
   of new dams, and of the enlargement, alteration, repair, or removal of
   existing dams; and (3) supervision over maintenance and operation of
   all dams of jurisdictional size.

   Dams under jurisdiction are artificial barriers, together with
   appurtenant works, which are 25 feet or more in height or have an
   impounding capacity of 50 acre-feet or more. Any artificial barrier not
   in excess of 6 feet in height, regardless of storage capacity, or that
   has a storage capacity not in excess of 15 acre-feet, regardless of
   height, is not considered jurisdictional.

   In 1963, the failure of the Baldwin Hills Dam, in Southern California,
   caused the Legislature to amend the Water Code to include within State
   jurisdiction, both new and existing off-stream storage facilities.

   The statutes governing dam safety in California, Division 3 of the
   Water Code, place the supervision of the safety of non-federal dams and
   reservoirs under the jurisdiction of the Department of Water Resources'
   Division of Safety of Dams. In administering Division 3 of the Water
   Code, the Department must comply with provisions of the California
   Environmental Quality Act of 1970. In compliance with that Act, all
   formal approval and revocation actions must be preceded by appropriate
   environmental documentation.

   The Division of Safety of Dams reviews plans and specifications for the
   construction of new dams or for the enlargement, alteration, repair, or
   removal of existing dams, under application, and must grant written
   approval before the owner can proceed with construction. Professional
   engineers and geologists from the Division evaluate each project,
   investigate proposed sites, and check available construction materials.

   During construction, they identify conditions disclosed during site
   development which may require design changes; they check for compliance
   with approved plans and specifications; and they approve foundations
   before material is placed.

   The Department of Water Resources must have issued a certificate of
   approval based upon the findings of its personnel, before water can be
   impounded behind a new dam or behind an existing dam which has been
   enlarged, altered, or repaired. These certificates may contain
   restrictive conditions and may be amended or revoked by the Department
   of Water Resources.

   Operating dams are periodically inspected to assure that they are
   adequately maintained and to direct the owner to correct any
   deficiencies found.

   The Division conducts investigations of selected dams which include a
   comprehensive review of all pertinent material contained in the
   Division's files, a visual project inspection, technical studies when
   necessary and preparation of a comprehensive report.

   Inasmuch as the approval of an application to construct a dam does not
   grant the right to appropriate water, the applicant must apply for a
   water right permit through the State Water Resources Control Board
   prior to filing an application to construct a dam.   An application
   filed with the Division will initiate action for conformance with the
   requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970.
