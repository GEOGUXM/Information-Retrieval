 DOL Seal SUBPOENAS
          This page describes the procedure for obtaining a subpoena in a case
          pending before the United States Department of Labor, Office of
          Administrative Law Judges, (OALJ) or in a Longshore or black lung case
          pending before the District Director, Office of Workers' Compensation
          programs (OWCP).

          CAUTION: OALJ subpoenas may only be used in cases before the United
          States Department of Labor in which OALJ has lawful authority to issue
          subpoenas. more...



   Bullet The Process:

   To obtain a subpoena you may either:

     NOTE: This form was revised on December 5, 2001. If you downloaded

     improved form.

     (1) Download the subpoena form off this web site; complete the
     applicable information; print the subpoena, and send it to the
     appropriate judge with a request for issuance of the subpoena. If
     approved by the presiding judge, the subpoena will be returned with
     the case number inscribed, the judge's signature and an embossed
     USDOL seal.

     Approval, or Acrobat Reader. Please note that only Adobe Acrobat and
     Adobe Approval permit you to save a completed form to your hard
     drive.

     The information you type on these forms is not transmitted over the
     Internet. You must print the completed form, and mail it to the
     trial judge.

     or

     (2) Obtain pre-printed subpoenas by contacting the appropriate
     judge's office. At the presiding judge's discretion, that office
     will provide you up to 10 blank subpoenas with the embossed seals
     and signatures; the case number will be inscribed on the subpoena
     and you must limit your use of the subpoena to that case. Some
     judges may impose additional requirements for issuance of subpoenas,
     but in all cases requests for more than 10 blank subpoenas must
     include a written justification.

   Bullet Who to contact:

   Mailing addresses and phone numbers are found on the Contact Page. All
   requests for subpoenas must be made in writing.

   Assigned case: Once a case is assigned to a presiding judge, all
   subpoena requests must be made to that judge's office. The National
   Office will NOT issue subpoenas once a case is assigned.

   Unassigned case: In Longshore cases that have not yet been assigned to
   a presiding judge, direct requests for subpoenas to the applicable
   District Office, or, if you are not sure of which District Office has
   the case, to the National Office in Washington, D.C.

   For all other unassigned cases, application for subpoenas should be
   directed to the National Office in Washington, D.C.

   Cases Pending Before the District Director: For Longshore workers'
   compensation cases, the Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) has
   the exclusive authority to issue subpoenas
   , whether the case is before the OWCP or the OALJ. See Maine v.
   Brady-Hamilton Stevedore Co., 18 BRBS 129 (1986) (en banc); Butler v.
   Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc., 28 BRBS 114 (1994). All requests for
   subpoenas in cases still pending before OWCP should be directed to the
   OALJ National Office in Washington, D.C. For FECA claims you must
   request subpoenas from OWCP. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 10.619, 10.620.

   Bullet Required elements for validity:

   To be valid, a subpoena must (1) show the case number, (2) bear the
   embossed seal of the Department of Labor, and (3) bear the signature of
   the administrative law judge having the authority to issue the
   subpoena.

   The subpoena should be served with both Page 1 and Page 2. If
   practical, the subpoena should be printed as a two-sided copy on a
   single sheet of paper.

   Bullet Duties of Person Issuing Subpoena:

   Notice against improper use of subpoenas: A party or an attorney
   responsible for the issuance and service of an administrative subpoena
   must adhere to the following principles:

          (1) the subpoena must be issued for a lawful purpose within the
          statutory authority of the issuing agency;
          (2) the documents requested must be relevant to that purpose;
          and
          (3) the subpoena demand must be reasonable and not unduly
          burdensome.

   Misuse of subpoenas may result in sanctions, including dismissal of the
   case, under 29 C.F.R. §§ 18.6(d)(2), 18.29, 18.34(g)(3), 18.36. See
   also Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(1).

   Moreover, when you request subpoenas from this office you are
   representing that the subpoenas will be used in an administrative
   proceeding before OALJ or OWCP. Federal criminal statutes provide
   penalties of up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to 5 years for
   knowing and willful submission of false statements to the Federal
   Government. 18 U.S.C. 1001; see also 18 U.S.C. 1546. Thus, do NOT
   attempt to serve subpoenas obtained from OALJ for uses other than in a
   case pending before OALJ or OWCP in which you are an attorney or
   authorized representative of a party, or are proceeding pro se.

   Notice regarding expenses: A witness, other than a witness for the
   Federal Government, may not be required to attend a deposition or
   hearing unless the mileage and witness fees are paid in advance. See 29
   C.F.R. § 18.24(a).

   Prior Notice of Use of Subpoena in Discovery: Notice must be given
   pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 18.22(c) when using a subpoena to direct
   appearance at a deposition. In addition, a party desiring to take the
   deposition of any person upon oral examination shall give reasonable
   notice in writing to every other party to the action. Fed. R. Civ. P.
   30(b)(1), as made applicable by 29 C.F.R. § 18.1(a). Similarly, use of
   a subpoena on a third party to command production of documents and
   things or inspection of premises before the hearing requires prior
   notice to all parties prior to service of the subpoena on the nonparty.
   Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(b)(1), as made applicable by 29 C.F.R. § 18.1(a).
   See McCurdy v. Wedgewood Capital Management Co., Inc., No. Civ.A.
   97-4304, 1998 WL 964185, *6 (E.D. Pa Nov. 16, 1998).

   Bullet Duties of Person Responding to Subpoena:

   Any subpoenaed organization not a party to this adversary proceeding
   shall designate one or more officers, directors, or managing agents, or
   other persons who consent to testify on its behalf, and may set forth,
   for each person designated, the matters on which the person will
   testify, Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(b)(6) made applicable by 29 C.F.R. § 18.1(a).

   A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents should produce
   them as they are kept in the usual course of business, or shall
   organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the
   demand. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(1).

   Any motion to quash or limit the subpoena shall be filed in compliance
   with 29 C.F.R. § 18.24(c) (the full text of Part 18.24 is set out
   below).

   Notice to entities covered by the regulations implementing the Health
   Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, in regard to the
   privacy of individually identifiable health information. If a subpoena
   purportedly issued under the authority of the Office of Administrative
   Law Judges does not bear a raised, embossed seal, it is not valid under
   45 CFR §§164.512(e), 164.512(f) or 164.512(l). These regulations went
   into effect on April 14, 2001; the general rule compliance date is
   April 14, 2003 (April 14, 2004 for small health plans). For more
   information see the HHS, Office of Civil Rights Spotlight on Privacy of
   Medical Records web page (this link leaves the USDOL/OALJ web site).

   Bullet Rules:

   The general rule governing subpoenas is found at 29 C.F.R. § 18.24. You
   should also check any procedural rules specifically applicable to the
   subject matter of the case before OALJ or OWCP:

   § 18.24 Subpoenas.

          (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the
          Chief Administrative Law Judge or the presiding administrative
          law judge, as appropriate, may issue subpoenas as authorized by
          statute or law upon written application of a party requiring
          attendance of witnesses and production of relevant papers,
          books, documents, or tangible things in their possession and
          under their control. A subpoena may be served by certified mail
          or by any person who is not less than 18 years of age. A
          witness, other than a witness for the Federal Government, may
          not be required to attend a deposition or hearing unless the
          mileage and witness fee applicable to witnesses in courts of the
          United States for each date of attendance is paid in advance of
          the date of the proceeding.

          (b) If a party's written application for subpoena is submitted
          three (3) working days or less before the hearing to which it
          relates, a subpoena shall issue at the discretion of the Chief
          Administrative Law Judge or presiding administrative law judge,
          as appropriate.

          (c) Motion to quash or limit subpoena. Within ten (10) days of
          receipt of a subpoena but no later than the date of the hearing,
          the person against whom it is directed may file a motion to
          quash or limit the subpoena, setting forth the reasons why the
          subpoena should be withdrawn or why it should by limited in
          scope. Any such motion shall be answered within ten (10) days of
          service, and shall be ruled on immediately thereafter. The order
          shall specify the date, if any, for compliance with the
          specifications of the subpoena.

          (d) Failure to comply. Upon the failure of any person to comply
          with an order to testify or a subpoena, the party adversely
          affected by such failure to comply may, where authorized by
          statute or by law, apply to the appropriate district court for
          enforcement of the order or subpoena.

   Following are excerpts from the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.
   §§ 555 and 556 relevant to ALJ subpoenas:

   § 555. Ancillary matters

     * * *
     (d) Agency subpenas authorized by law shall be issued to a party on
     request and, when required by rules of procedure, on a statement or
     showing of general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence
     sought. On contest, the court shall sustain the subpena or similar
     process or demand to the extent that it is found to be in accordance
     with law. In a proceeding for enforcement, the court shall issue an
     order requiring the appearance of the witness or the production of
     the evidence or data within a reasonable time under penalty of
     punishment for contempt in case of contumacious failure to comply. *
     * *
     (Pub. L. 89-554, Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 385.)

   § 556. Hearings; presiding employees; powers and duties; burden of
   proof; evidence; record as basis of decision

     (a) This section applies, according to the provisions thereof, to
     hearings required by section 553 or 554 of this title to be
