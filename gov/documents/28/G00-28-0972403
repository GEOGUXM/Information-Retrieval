     INDIRECT COST BRANCH

     The DFAS Indirect Cost Branch is the centralized organizational
     component authorized to negotiate indirect cost rates with
     commercial companies which receive the preponderance of their
     federal awards from NIH. The Branch negotiates provisional rates
     that are used to fund and reimburse indirect costs on contracts and
     grants and final rates, based on actual costs, that are used to
     adjust indirect costs previously reported or reimbursed using
     provisional rates. [Go to the  Indirect Cost Submission  web page
     for electronic copies of the BranchÂ’s information package
     documents.]
