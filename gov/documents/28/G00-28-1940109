   Current Agroforestry Research

   Production of No-Input Forage as Affected by Loblolly Pine Spacing

   Agroforestry is a relatively new agricultural system for US landowners.
   Research is needed on optimal tree spacing, site fertilization, and
   productivity of pine tree stands and understory forage in open
   pastures. Pines often are planted on poorer, less fertile sites and
   neither the pines nor the forage may receive adequate fertilization.
   Lack of adequate fertilization reduces the growth of pines and improved
   forages, but unimproved range may not respond well to fertilization.
   Some summer weeds and grasses in unimproved range can provide livestock
   with acceptable or even higher quality forage than pearl millet and
   bermudagrass.

   Since optimal pine spacing and forage fertilization needs are
   management objective-driven and site specific, one recommendation will
   not fit all needs. There is uncertainty of the extent to which forage
   yield and quality are affected by tree spacing. Growers need more
   information to be able to match silvopasture design and management with
   their own conditions and budget.

   A study is nearing completion in which baseline information was
   collected on yield and quality of no-input forage produced under
   several tree spacing designs. Trees were planted in 1994 and there was
   no fertilizer application since then. Plots were located in the middle
   of tree alleys that were 8' to 48' wide, and open (no trees). Tall
   fescue was an important forage component only in the spring harvests,
   while panicum, foxtail, and bermudagrass predominated in fall harvests.
   Forage yield increased from 8', 12', to 16' alleys, but did not change
   significantly among 16' to 48' alleys or in the open. The relationship
   between alley width and yield was similar to that between alley width
   and amount of shade. Alleys 32' and wider received full sun, while 8'
   alleys received only about 45% sunlight. While yield and sunlight
   reception were related to tree spacing, we cannot say at this point
   that shade was the only factor governing yield. Soil moisture, which we
   did not measure, also could have affected yield at high tree densities.

   We found that forage in 8' alleys was highest in crude protein (9.6%)
   and decreased to about 8% in the open. However, the higher protein was
   more than offset by the very low yield at this spacing. NDF, an
   estimate of intake, indicated that forage was comparable to
   bermudagrass, but ADF, an estimate of digestibility, was poorer than
   bermudagrass (Table 1). Forage nutrient and mineral levels were
   generally adequate for maintaining beef cattle, except for crude
   protein and sodium. Phosphorus was marginally adequate.

   Forage yield averaged about 2,500 lb/A per year. This yield was very
   poor compared to adjacent fertilized plots containing tall fescue and
   bermudagrass that yielded about 10,000 lb/A, showing the benefit of
   pasture fertilization. But the yield was about twice that of native
   grasses and common bermudagrass in Louisiana under 22-yr-old loblolly
   pine. The yield data confirmed that 16' alleys were the minimally
   acceptable width for forage production and equipment access at this
   stage of tree growth. As the trees grow they will need to be thinned to
   prevent forage growth from being overly reduced by competition with
   trees, and pruned to produce quality sawlogs.

   produced under loblolly pine in 1999 and 2000.

   Productivity of Tall Fescue and Orchardgrass Under Loblolly and
   Shortleaf Pine

   In this region, tall fescue is the cool-season grass of choice for
   agroforestry applications because of its widespread use in more
   conventional agricultural applications, and its shade tolerance. There
   has been relatively little research, however, on other grasses that
   might also be productive in the shade. Orchardgrass is one possible
   replacement for tall fescue for a number of reasons. As its name
   suggests, orchardgrass grows well under trees. Its regrowth has higher
   nutritive value than tall fescue, it lacks the fescue toxicosis
   problems associated with the tall fescue endophyte, and it is highly
   responsive and competitive when fertilized. Further, orchardgrass grows
   well in this area, is a preferred forage by cattle, and many producers
   are familiar with it.

   We are conducting research to compare the productivity of
   >Potomac= orchardgrass, >Kentucky 31' tall fescue, and a 50-50 mixture
   of the two grasses grown under loblolly and shortleaf pine, and in the
   open. Trees were planted in 1992 and grasses were sown in fall 1999.
   The study is in its early stages and has been harvested three times. To
   date, yields of the three grass treatments are nearly equal. However,
   tall fescue tends to yield more in the open than under trees, while
   orchardgrass tends to yield well both in the open and under the denser
   canopy of loblolly pine. Orchardgrass also seems to be more competitive
   than tall fescue under trees and in the open as it is increasing in the
   plots. Overall, yield under trees is about 2/3 of yield in the open
   showing that trees and grasses are competing with one another. Thinning
   and pruning the trees could open up the canopy and increase forage
   yield.

   Another related study on orchardgrass is being conducted by Center
   researchers. Loblolly pine was planted at a 5 x 10' spacing (870 trees
   per acre) in 1997. Ten cultivars of orchardgrass were sown in alleys in
   fall 1999 to determine whether they differ in persistence during the
   early stages of a loblolly pine rotation. Plots are largely unshaded
   and have been cut three times. Yields have been excellent, averaging as
   much as 1,800 lb orchardgrass per acre. We anticipate that the yield
   differences between cultivars will be even greater once the trees and
   grass become more competitive.

   Ice Damage to Pine Stands

   An ice (glaze) storm struck northeast Texas and east central and
   southwest Arkansas on Christmas day, 2000. The storm was historically
   significant because of the heavy ice accumulation (estimates of as much
   as 1" accumulation in some places) and widespread devastation (315,000
   Arkansans lost power). The Arkansas Forestry Commission estimated that
   68,000 acres of private, nonindustrial forest land suffered complete
   timber loss estimated at $50 million or more. During the storm,
   freezing rain accumulated to such an extent that tree branches, tops,
   or trunks bent severely or broke.

   Ice damage is frequently assessed but, since every storm event is
   unique, damage can differ considerably due to storm characteristics and
   severity, geography, and tree species, age, spacing, management, and
   health. We were fortunate in that there was no significant wind
   associated with this storm, which would have made the damage much more
   severe than it was. In a storm-affected stand the damage to individual
   trees can range from none to total loss, with all stages in between. We
   are assessing the ice damage suffered by pine trees on the Center and
   in two pine stands on Rogers Scout Reservation. Trees represented four
   age classes and most were at pre-commercial stages of growth where
   pulpwood salvage would not be possible.

   Four-yr-old loblolly pine suffered almost no permanent damage.
   Seven-yr-old trees were in 1 A blocks ranging from 228 to 1,380 trees
   per acre (TPA). While many published reports indicated that amount of
   ice damage is not related to tree spacing, we found that trees suffered
   more breakage to the lower 75% of the tree truck in more open stands.
   There tended to be more straight trees and fewer severely bent ones in
   narrow alleys. We are monitoring the recovery of 40 selected trees
   having different amounts of trunk bending.

   Nine-yr-old loblolly and shortleaf pines were rated only for breakage.
   Both pine species had about 1/3 breakage. Based on sunlight readings
   done in 2000 and 2001, the ice storm did not appear to have opened up
   this stand. Differences in ice damage between two 18-yr-old stands
   having about 50 and 980 TPA were due to thinning that occurred within
   the past five years. The thinned stand had fewer undamaged trees, more
   severely leaning and bent trees, and more broken trunks.

   Another 7-yr-old stand having an initial density of 680 TPA (4' x 16'
   spacing) was thinned to two densities, 250 or 500 TPA, following the
   storm by removing broken and severely bent trees. Thinning to 250 TPA
   resulted in removal of most severely damaged trees, while some bent
   trees remained at 500 TPA. Thus, while a stand may appear at first
   glance to be damaged beyond repair, there may be enough sound trees to
   recover a commercial stand. Further, some trees that are bent or have
   broken tops may actually yield a marketable product later in the
   rotation. Our data suggest that it may be preferable to plant pines at
   relatively close spacing, 4' x 16' for example, so that if an ice storm
   occurs early in the rotation there should be enough undamaged trees to
   obtain a reasonably well-stocked stand.

   From a Pasture to a Silvopasture System

   (by J.L. Robinson and T. Clason, AF Note 22, National Agroforestry
   Center, Dec. 2000).

   Research has demonstrated that, if managed properly, forage production
   can be maintained in a silvopasture system while producing high value
   timber and livestock. Pines have been found to be compatible with
   forage production and livestock grazing when properly managed. This
   article provides options for establishing pines in existing pasture
   systems for the production and management of both forest and forage
   products. The following are planning considerations to convert from
   pasture to silvopasture:

   Soils

   Determine the soil suitability of the area for establishing pine trees.
   If the soil is not suited to pine species do not convert from pasture.

   Tree Planting

   Determine the desired row spacing for the pine planting. Planting rates
   from 100 to 400 TPA are typically recommended for planting a
   silvopasture system. Trees may be grown in single rows or in aggregate
   rows called sets with wide alleys for forage production between sets.

   Planting arrangement should consider management objectives, equipment
   operation, adequate growing space until the first tree harvest, and
   companion-forage species needs. The desired establishment density is,
   in part, determined by the existing markets for timber products. Higher
   planting densities will require the removal of smaller diameter trees
   to prevent canopy closure. If readily available markets for small round
   wood exist then the higher planting densities are feasible options. If
   such markets don't exist, the lower planting densities have the
   advantage of reducing the need for non-commercial thinning.

   On sloping land, rows should be oriented on the contour to prevent soil
   erosion within the tree rows during establishment.

   Site Preparation and Establishment

   Determine site preparation needs. Apply a herbicide or till a strip 2
   to 4' wide for each row to be planted. If the soil has a compacted
   layer, rip or subsoil along the planting rows. This improves the ease
   of planting and improves rooting conditions for young seedlings, thus
   ensuring better survival and growth. In some areas, a prescribed burn
   or pesticide treatment may be needed to control rodents prior to tree
   planting. Follow-up applications of selective herbicides for two to
   three years may aid tree establishment. Follow locally approved tree
   planting practices for tree establishment.

   Tree Management

   Determine the tree management needs.

   
   Thinning. Trees generally have little impact on forage production until
   shading becomes dense enough to limit sunlight to the understory.
   Thinning of trees is scheduled to reduce canopy shade and tree
   competition for understory forage production. When the trees= combined
   canopy exceeds 35 to 45%, forage production of warm-season grasses
   begins to decline. Continuous observation is important in making
   adjustment to the management strategy. For cool-season grasses, shade
   tolerance of some species may exceed 60% and still produce good forage
   yields. Depending upon the species of grass, tree thinning needs to be
   conducted to keep canopy cover below the maximum shade tolerance level.
   With proper establishment densities the first thinning should be
   planned around 10 to 15 years of age for pulp or small round wood.
   Successive thinnings can be scheduled about every five years until
   final harvest at approximately 30 to 45 years. This schedule will vary
   some depending upon the productivity of the site, the species of tree,
   and the targeted, final wood products.

   
   Pruning. Widely spaced trees delay tree canopy closure benefitting
   forage crops but the "open grown" trees may develop large branches that
   can reduce wood quality if trees are not pruned. The object of pruning
   is to confine the knots created by these branches to a small diameter
   (four inches) of core wood thereby producing high quality, knot free
   wood on the outer diameter of the tree stem.

   
   Pruning should be initiated when the crop trees reach 15 to 20' and/or
   the stump diameter reaches 5" at a height 6" above the ground.

   
   Pruning should strive to remove all of the branches where the trunk
   diameter is greater than four inches. But, never remove more than 50%
   of the live canopy.

   
   Pruning operations should be scheduled periodically until the tree bole
   is pruned up to 18'. Each successive pruning operation proceeds up the
   main tree stem to a 4" diameter core but removes no more than 1/3 to
   1/2 of the total crown while maintaining a live crown equal to 1/3 of
   the tree height.

   
   Pruning operations continue until a 18' knot-free log is developed.
   Follow local guidelines from the state forestry agency, NRCS, or
   extension service for proper pruning techniques.

   Grazing Management

   Very young trees are subject to browsing or trampling by livestock.
   Grazing should be restricted or excluded during the first two to three
   years after establishment or until the terminal bud of the trees is
   above the reach of livestock (6 to 8'). Forage produced during these
   years can still be mechanically harvested and utilized for hay. Once
   the terminal bud of the trees is above the grazing height of livestock,
   grazing can proceed without damage to the trees. If heavy browsing is
   observed there may be a deficiency in the livestock diet. Pines are not
   typically browsed by livestock when adequate quality forage is
   available.

   As with any managed grazing system, soil amendments should be applied
   as needed to maintain desired forage production levels. An added
   benefit is that stem production of wood has been shown to increase by
   20 to 30% in response to fertilizer management for forage production.

   Continuous grazing is not recommended for silvopasture systems. A
   planned grazing system in which multi-grazing units are rested and
   grazed in a planned sequence should be developed. The grazing
   management plan should maintain an adequate balance between livestock
   numbers and forage production. Close monitoring of forage, livestock,
   and timber performance will provide economic and environmental benefits
   attainable through silvopasture systems.

   Center's First Field Day in Recent Years

   The Center held its first field day in several years on June 2, 2001.
   One of the reasons the Center has not had a field day recently is that
   most of the Center's scientists have been here less than three years.
   It takes at least three years for a field research project to progress
   from conception to a point when a scientist has something definite to
   say about the results. Results must be made available to farmers and
   ranchers for the Center's research to have impact on agriculture. An
   annual field day is one tool that the Center is using to inform farmers
   of research results.

   My goals for this first field day were three-fold: 1) to provide the
   local public the opportunity to visit; 2) to provide an opportunity for
   local farmers and ranchers to learn about the Center's research
   program; 3) to promote the activities of the Center's partners and
   cooperators. My objectives for goals 1 and 2 were to give attendees a
   glimpse of the projects being conducted at the Center rather than an
   exhaustive report. The topics for the field day were: 1) Overview of
   NRCS/ Plant Material Center activities; 2) Hardwood-based agroforestry
   systems; 3) Evaluation of hair sheep breeds for meat production; 4)
   Grazing studies for enhancing stocker cattle production; 5) Pine-based
   agroforestry systems; and 6) Incorporating poultry litter into
   pastures. It was our hope that brief project reports would spark
   interest leading to invitations to address interested groups or to
   develop more specific, more detailed programs later in the year. One
   weakness that I see now in the program that was presented on June 2 was
   the Center did not present results from its current research program
   related to cow-calf production. Many of the local farmers engage in
   cow-calf operations and thus were not made aware of our efforts in this
   area.

   The Center has many off-site cooperators. Most of the Center's partners
   and cooperators attended the field day and brought displays explaining
   their research projects. I appreciate their attendance. Their presence
   demonstrated that the Center's activities impact not just Logan County,
   Arkansas, but also adjacent states.

   Approximately 130 people from various points throughout Arkansas and 2
   from the state of Oregon attended the field day. Attendees varied
   greatly in their background from local town people to people traveling
   through the area who wanted to hear Representative Asa Hutchinson speak
   (Representative Hutchinson recently was nominated by President Bush to
   be the chief of the Drug Enforcement agency, DEA). To all of those who
   attended: thank you for your time and interest. If you have comments
   regarding the field day, please pass them on to me using the contact
   information found in this newsletter.

   Very early in planning for the field day, I decided to invite
   Representative Hutchinson to be the featured lunch time speaker.
   Representative Hutchinson has been a strong supporter of the Center,
   and of agricultural research and education during his years in the
   House. The Center has appreciated his support over the years. After the
   field day, it was related to me that some people did not attend because
   Representative Hutchinson was the featured speaker. The feeling being
   expressed was that Representative Hutchinson's prominent role made the
   field day more of a political rally than an event for the general
   public and/or farmers. The field day was never intended to be a
   political rally. The Center was committed to holding the field day
   months prior to the time that Representative Hutchinson agreed to
   speak. Representatives and Senators are important to the continued
   presence and growth of the Center. Therefore, it is important to us at
   the Center that they visit. Representatives and Senators are more
   likely to visit the Center in conjunction with a public event, like a
   field day. The presence of an elected official at any field day is not
   an endorsement of a political party, candidate. etc. Three of the four
   Representatives and both Senators and/or their staffs were invited to
   attend the field day. How widespread and deep this concern regarding
   the presence of elected officials at a field day is not known to me. If
   you have concerns, I would appreciate hearing your comments. The
   attendance of elected officials was commonplace at most field days I
   attended while growing up in Delaware.

   Again thank you for attending and/or participating in the June 2 field
   day. Also I want to express my thanks to the Booneville School
   District, Booneville Industrial Development Corporation, and the USDA
   committee of the Booneville Chamber of Commerce for their help and
   support in making the field day a success.

   Trees + Agriculture = Agroforestry!

   A winning combination

   Some farmers have expressed amazement that anyone would want to put
   trees in their agricultural fields. "After all", they say "my daddy and
   grand-daddy spent a lot of time clearing trees out of the fields!" Yet
   more and more farmers are implementing farming practices involving
   trees. These are called agroforestry and they combine traditional
   agriculture and forestry practices in an integrated, mutually
   beneficial land use.

   Agroforestry is well known in many parts of the world and is beginning
   to take hold in the United States. Simply defined, agroforestry
   combines trees with crops and/or livestock for diversifying farm income
   and providing conservation benefits. There are five agroforestry
   practices used in temperate zones. Alley cropping combines rows of
   trees with crops grown in the alley ways between the trees. Riparian
   forest buffers, a combination of trees, shrubs, and grasses, are
   established on streams and river banks. Their purpose is to enhance
   bio-diversity, to prevent erosion of streambanks and to protect the
   water resource from pollution. Trees are combined with pastures and
   livestock for silvopasture agroforestry. Windbreaks and shelterbelts,
   where trees protect soils, crops, and livestock from the wind, are also
   considered an agroforestry practice. Finally, even existing forest
   stands can be used in forest farming. High value specialty crops such
   as ginseng, goldenseal, and mushrooms are cultivated under the
   protection of a forest canopy that has been modified to provide the
   right amount of shade.

   There are a variety of benefits provided by agroforestry such as
   improved crop
   production, greater economic gain, improved soil and water quality, and
   increasing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Wildlife habitat
   can be enhanced if that is a goal and insect populations can be
   controlled in a more biologically-sound manner. A recent study has
   shown that the number of damaging insects decreased in an alfalfa -
   walnut alley cropping system.
