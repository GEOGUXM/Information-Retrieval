   Interim Guidance for Section 106 Cases Involving No Historic
   Properties Affected and
   No Adverse Effect Findings

   On September 18, 2001, a Federal district court upheld the Advisory
   Council on Historic Preservations Section 106 regulations against
   numerous challenges raised by the National Mining Association and the
   Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association.

   Nevertheless, the court invalidated two subsections of the Section 106
   regulations insofar as they allowed the Council to effectively reverse
   a Federal agencys findings of no historic properties affected
   (Section 800.4(d)(2)) and no adverse effects (Section 800.5(c)(3)).

   Prior to the court decision, an objection by the Council or State
   Historic Preservation Officer/Tribal Historic Preservation Officer
   (SHPO/THPO) to a no historic properties affected finding required the
   Federal agency to proceed to the next step, where it would assess
   whether the effects were adverse. A Council objection to a no adverse
   effect finding required the Federal agency to attempt to resolve the
   adverse effects.

   The Council and the Department of Justice are presently studying the
   possibility of appealing the courts invalidation of the cited
   subsections. The Council will make an announcement on its Web site when
   a final decision is made regarding such an appeal.

   In the meantime, the Council plans to provide opinions to Federal
   agencies regarding their no historic properties affected findings,
   pursuant to Section 800.9(a) of its regulations, whenever appropriate.
   However, such opinions will be advisory and will not require the
   Federal agencies to continue to the next step in the Section 106
   process.

   In the event that a SHPO/THPO does not agree with a finding of no
   historic properties affected, the agency official should notify the
   Council and seek an advisory opinion. The Council believes this interim
   step, while not mandatory, would help resolve disputes and avoid the
   potential for litigation or other delays.

   The Council will continue reviewing no adverse effect disputes
   referred to it under Section 800.5(c)(2) within the allotted 15 day
   period. Nevertheless, the Councils opinion on such matters will be
   advisory and will not require agencies to proceed to the next step in
   the process.
