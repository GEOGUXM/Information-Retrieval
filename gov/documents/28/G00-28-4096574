                        Environmental & Energy Award
   The Environmental Program Branch has developed a new awards program in
     recognition of an individual, small group, or organization that has
   contributed to the successful operations of preserving our environment,
      conserving our energy, and reserving our natural resources while
        reaching for the stars. This award is given in honor of their
       exceptional performance in making a unique contribution to the
     environmental & energy awareness program and enhancing substantial
    savings. A certificate with a newly designed environmental logo patch
     will be awarded biannually. The patch has been flown on one of the
    Shuttle fleets; therefore, a certificate of authenticity will also be
                           attached to the award.
   To nominate an individual, small group or organization, please contact
        Kathleen Ellis, BA-B, (321) 867-7002 or visit the website at:
