   The Hearing Board is established by state law and consists of five
   members - an attorney, a professional engineer, a medical doctor and
   two members of the public.  The Hearing Board is a quassi-judicial body
   that rules on particular cases that affect only individual facilities.
   It is authorized to hear requests for variance relief, permit
   revocation, abatement orders, and appeals by permit applicants, or by
   interested third parties, concerning the issuance or denial of permits.

   In accordance with California Health & Safety Code Section 40807, the
   Hearing Board may adopt rules for the conduct of its hearings.  The
   Hearing Board [pdficon.gif] Rules govern how the board operates and how
   parties are to make submissions to the Board.

   The Calendar of Hearings is published weekly.
