   The pixel half-planes will be "L-shaped," with one frame above and one
   below the beam. Each frame will be movable such that the alignment with
   respect to the beam is adjustable. In that way, the size of the beam
   hole will also be adjustable, separately both horizontally and
   vertically. This will allow us to optimize the balance between
   radiation damage and physics reach. Smaller hole size gives better
   vertex resolution, aceptance, tagging efficency, and thus physics
   reach. The experiment performance can be optimized as experience is
   gained, both in operating conditions and physics analysis issues. The
   mechanical supports will be carbon composite structures which will
   include integrated cooling channels(tubes). These structures will be
   manufactured by Energy Science Laboratories, Inc. (ESLI) by sandwiching
   nonporous carbon tubes between two sheets of carbon "flocking," which
   consists of many individual carbon fibers and looks like velvet
   material. The "fuzzy carbon" surfaces of this structure will be
   machined to provide "shingled" surface on which the multichip
   assemblies will be mounted. This construction allows sensors on one
   side of the cooling support to overlap, and therefore allows two pixel
   measurement planes to be mounted on a single cooling support.
