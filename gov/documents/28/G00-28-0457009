                                What is the GII?
     __________________________________________________________________

   Governments around the globe have come to recognize that the
   telecommunications, information services, and information technology
   sectors are not only dynamic growth sectors themselves, but are also
   engines of development and economic growth throught the economy. With
   this realization, governments have sharply focused their public policy
   debates and initiatives on the capabilities of their underlying
   information infrastructures. The United States is but one of many
   countries currently pursuing national initiatives to capture the
   promise of the Information Revolution. Our initiative shares with
   others an important, common objective: to ensure that the full
   potential benefit of advances in information and telecommunications
   technologies are realized for all citizens.

   The GII is an outgrowth of that perspective, a vehicle for expanding
   the scope of these benefits on a global scale. By interconnecting
   local, national, regional, and global networks, the GII can increase
   economic growth, create jobs, and improve infrastructures. Taken as a
   whole, this worldwide "network of networks" will create a global
   information marketplace, encouraging broad-based social discourse
   within and among all countries.

   The GII will depend upon upon an ever-expanding range of technology and
   products, including telephones, fax machines, computers, switches,
   compact discs, video and audio tape, coaxial cable, wire, satellites,
   optical fiber transmission lines, microwave networks, televisions,
   scanners, cameras, and printers - as will as advances in computing,
   information, and networking technologies not yet envisioned.

   But the GII extends beyond hardware and software; it is also a system
   of applications, activities, and relationships. There is the
   information itself, whatever its purpose or form, e.g., video
   programming, scientific or business databases, images, sound
   recordings, library archives, or other media. There are also standards,
   interfaces, and transmission codes that facilitate interoperability
   between networks and ensure the privacy and security of the information
   carried over them, as well as the security and reliability of the
   networks themselves. Most importantly, the GII includes the people
   involved in the creation and use of information, develomment of
   applications and services, construction of the facilities, and training
   necessary to realize the potential of the GII.
