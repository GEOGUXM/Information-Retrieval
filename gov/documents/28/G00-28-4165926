                Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D)



   Background

   Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D), initiated in 1962, helps
   people care for and protect their natural resources to improve their
   areas economy, environment and living standards. RC&D provides a way
   for local residents to work together and plan how they can actively
   solve environmental, economic and social problems facing their
   communities. Today, RC&D continues to successfully deliver coordinated
   resource conservation and rural development assistance.

   RC&D provides the "no turf" network that pulls together communities,
   various units of government and grassroots organizations and helps them
   establish direction for local problem solutions. Currently, 331 RC&D
   areas serve an area larger than half of the United States, the
   Caribbean and the Pacific Basin. More than 20,000 volunteers annually
   contribute their time and resources to revitalize and sustain their
   communities.
