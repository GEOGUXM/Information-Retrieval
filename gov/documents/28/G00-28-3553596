   Land Surface Characterization Research
   and Satellite Data Management

      global land surface cover icon The Earth's global environmental systems
      on land and in the oceans and atmosphere constantly change. Society's
      uses of land and water resources can significantly influence natural
      environmental variability. Whether natural or human-induced, global
      environmental change impacts national and international social and
      economic systems, including nationally managed lands and water
      resources. Quality data and information about conditions and changes on
      the Earth's land surfaces are essential for maintaining productive
      lands and other globally important environmental resources. The
      objectives of the Land Surface Characterization Research and Satellite
      Data Management element are to:
        * Meet the growing demands for satellite data to support research
          focused on understanding the conditions and changes in earth
          systems.
        * Provide easy and efficient access to data describing the land
          surface for public and private use.
        * Develop and apply multi-resolution and multi-temporal data sets and
          descriptions of land characteristics to understand and model land
          processes and land-atmosphere interactions.
        * Enhance and apply technology for monitoring, analyzing, and
          predicting rates, patterns, and impacts of landscape changes
          resulting from natural and human causes.

   Research projects:

          Global Land Information System)
        * Global Elevation data
        * Land Surface Characterization in Alaska and Arctic Regions
        * Landscape Change Modeling
        * Landscape Change Detection (Reno and Lake Tahoe example)
        * Earthshots: Satellite Imagery of Environmental Change
        * Global Multi-Resolution Land Characterization
        * Landsat Pathfinder
        * Urban Dynamics
