                     New York State Education Department

                     E-Rate Technical Assistance Program
   (Schools and Libraries Telecommunications Discount Program)

   E-rate funding awards to schools and libraries in New York State have
   averaged over $200 million for each of the three years of the program's
   existence.  Funding applications for the fourth year (2001-2002) are
   due January 18, 2001.

   The New York State Education Department (NYSED) strongly encourages all
   NYS schools (K-12) and public libraries to take full advantage of
   E-rate discounts on telecommunications, Internet access, and internal
   wiring services. To support our States applicants, NYSED is extending
   its E-rate technical assistance program with E-Rate Central, an
   organization that has been working on the E-rate program since its
   inception with Nassau County BOCES and other school districts and
   vendors. The technical assistance program includes the following
   services:
     * E-Mail News  Current information and bulletins are being
       distributed weekly via e-mail to E-rate coordinators throughout the
       State.  New York State E-rate coordinators who are not on this
       distribution list can join by sending a request to E-Rate Central
       via e-mail (service@e-ratecentral.com) or fax (516-832-2877).
       Please include name, title, organization, address, telephone and
       fax numbers, and e-mail address.
     * Hot Lines  E-Rate Central will respond to specific E-rate
       questions submitted by e-mail (service@e-ratecentral.com) or fax
       (516-832-2877).
     * E-Rate Web Site  The E-Rate Central web site
       (http://www.e-ratecentral.com) is one of the top-rated Internet
       resources for E-rate information. News bulletins and weekly
       summaries are posted on the site on a current basis. Special
       instructions and tips are provided covering all phases of the
       E-rate application process. E-rate forms are available in several
       formats for off-line computer use.  For e-rate information on
       public libraries, please visit the New York State Public Library's
       web page on E-Rate for Public Libraries.
     * Technology Plan Approval  Applicants submitting Form 486s must
       certify that they have approved technology plans, Schools that do
       not have approved plans should contact E-Rate Central at the e-mail
       address or telephone numbers listed below. Libraries should contact
       the State Library Division of Library development via phone
       (518-474-7890) or fax (518-486-5254) or visit the New York State
       Library web page on E-Rate for Public Libraries.
     * Seminars  NYSED and E-Rate Central host a number of E-rate
       seminars throughout the State.  Seminars are announced as they
       arise through the e-mail distribution list and on the E-Rate
       Central web site. E-Rate Central is prepared to offer additional
       on-site seminars on a coordinated regional basis.
     * Vendor Coordination  NYSED, together with the NYS Public Service
       Commission and E-Rate Central, interfaces with vendors serving New
       York State applicants to work on billing issues and payment
       procedures. NYS vendor E-rate information, including SPIN numbers
       and BEAR form acknowledgement fax numbers, is available on the
       E-Rate Central web site.

   NYSED is committed to assisting all schools and libraries within New
   York State to take maximum advantage of the significant discounts
   offered by the E-rate program. Comments and suggestions on our E-rate
