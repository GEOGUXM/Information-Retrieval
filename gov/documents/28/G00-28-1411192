                              EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



           The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows the listing of
   "distinct population segments"(DPSs) of vertebrate species or
   subspecies as threatened or endangered, if severe declines in abundance
   are indicated or substantial risks are facing the species. Thus, two
   key questions must be addressed in determining whether a listing under
   the ESA is warranted: 1) Is the entity in question a "species" as
   defined by the ESA? and 2) If so, is the "species" in danger of
   extinction (endangered) or likely to become so (threatened)? Guidance
   on what constitutes a "distinct population segment" is provided by the
   joint U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and NMFS interagency
   policy on vertebrate populations (USFWS-NMFS 1996). Once a DPS is
   identified, NMFS considers a variety of factors in determining whether
   a listing is warranted.

           In response to a petition (Wright 1999) to list 18 species of
   marine fish in Puget Sound under the ESA, NMFS initiated status reviews
   of seven of these species: Pacific hake, Merluccius productus (Ayres,
   1855); Pacific cod, Gadus macrocephalus (Tilesius, 1810); walleye
   pollock, Theragra chalcogramma (Pallas, 1815); Pacific herring, Clupea
   pallasi (Valenciennes, 1847); brown rockfish, Sebastes auriculatus
   (Girard, 1854); copper rockfish, S. caurinus (Richardson, 1845); and
   quillback rockfish, S. maliger (Jordan and Gilbert, 1880). The National
   Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) formed a Biological Review Team (BRT),
   composed of scientists with expertise in one or more of these species,
   to conduct these status reviews. This status review summarizes the
   biological and environmental information gathered in that process and
   the preliminary conclusions reached by the BRT for brown rockfish,
   copper rockfish and quillback rockfish. This document is part of a
   larger effort by the National Marine Fisheries Service to complete
   status reviews for all seven of the petitioned species of marine fish
   in Puget Sound.

               Due to substantial variation in usage of the term "Puget
   Sound", we have adopted conventions for geographical regions in the
   inland waters of Washington State and British Columbia. Puget Sound
   proper is defined as the marine waters south of Admiralty Inlet and
   east of Deception Pass. North Puget Sound is defined by the United
   States-Canadian border on the north, a line due north of Cape Flattery
   on the west, the mainland on the east and a line drawn between Point
   Wilson and Partridge Point on Whidbey Island on the south. Washington
   Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) defines their North Puget Sound
   sampling area at a line drawn due north of the Sekiu River, however,
   the petitioner included the area between the Sekiu River and Cape
   Flattery in the petition for listing. In order to complete the status
   review process, the area between the Sekiu River and Cape Flattery is
   included as North Puget Sound in these deliberations. No genetic
   samples were taken in the area west of the Sekiu River to Cape
   Flattery, so this change should not affect the outcomes of the DPS
   delineations or risk analyses. Greater Puget Sound refers to the area
   of North Puget Sound and Puget Sound proper combined. The Strait of
   Georgia is the body of water separating the southern portion of
   Vancouver Island and the British Columbia mainland. It extends from the
   northern boundary of North Puget Sound to Cortes Island and Desolation
   Sound in the north. The Georgia Basin includes all of greater Puget
   Sound and the Strait of Georgia in British Columbia.

               The BRT examined environmental, geologic, biogeographic,
   life-history, and genetic information in the process of identifying
   DPSs. In particular, biogeography, ecological and habitat factors, and
   genetic population structure were found to be most informative for the
   species considered in this status review. Based on this examination,
   the BRT identified a DPS for each of the three rockfish species in
   Puget Sound proper that can be considered a species under the ESA. The
   BRT also concluded that there is good reason to believe that copper and
   quillback rockfish found in North Puget Sound are part of a northern
   Puget Sound DPS with rather uncertain northern and western boundaries.
   Brown rockfish are uncommon in North Puget Sound and most likely
   represent vagrants from the Puget Sound proper DPS.

               The ESA (Section 3) defines the term "endangered species"
   as "any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a
   significant portion of its range." The term "threatened species" is
   defined as "any species which is likely to become an endangered species
   within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion
   of its range." According to the ESA, the determination of whether a
   species is threatened or endangered should be made on the basis of the
   best scientific information available regarding its current status,
   after taking into consideration conservation measures that are proposed
   or are in place. In this status review, the BRT did not evaluate likely
   or possible effects of conservation measures, and therefore did not
   make recommendations as to whether identified DPSs should be listed as
   threatened or endangered species. Rather, the BRT drew scientific
   conclusions about the risk of extinction faced by identified DPSs under
   the assumption that present conditions will continue. The BRT concluded
   that none of the Puget Sound proper or northern Puget Sound DPSs for
   these three species are at risk of extinction, but the level of
   available information leaves substantial uncertainty in this
   determination.

                               Copper Rockfish

                               DPS Delineation

           The rockfish BRT considered five possible configurations that
   incorporate greater Puget Sound populations of copper rockfish. The
   first is a coastwide DPS that encompasses Puget Sound proper. The
   second scenario includes a coastal DPS that includes the Queen
   Charlotte Islands, a Puget Sound proper DPS, a Gulf Island DPS, a
   northern Puget Sound DPS (including the San Juan Islands) whose
   boundaries are uncertain and a Strait of Georgia DPS whose boundaries
   cannot be defined at present. The third scenario consists of a coastal
   DPS, and a Georgia Basin DPS. A fourth scenario consists of a coastal
   and Gulf Islands DPS, and a Puget Sound proper DPS. (The Gulf Islands
   are located off of the west coast of Canada in the Strait of Georgia
   between Vancouver Island and the British Columbia mainland. The Gulf
   Islands are a part of the same archipelago as the American San Juan
   Islands.). The fifth and last scenario includes a coastal DPS, a Puget
   Sound proper DPS, and a northern Puget Sound DPS which includes the
   Canadian Gulf Islands and extends to an uncertain degree northward into
   the Georgia Basin and westward toward the coastal DPS. All BRT members
   agreed that the fifth scenario (Fig. 1) is the most consistent with
   available information for copper rockfish, although substantial
   uncertainties remain, especially with regard to the extent of the
   northern Puget Sound DPS.

               Members of the BRT utilized a variety of evidence to
   support their identification of a Puget Sound proper DPS for copper
   rockfish. The preponderance was genetic in nature and came from work by
   Seeb (1998), Wimberger (In prep.) and Buonacoursi et al. (In prep.).
   The presence of a private allele in Puget Sound proper as well as
   assignment testing based on microsatellite genotypes provided
   convincing evidence of discreteness in the population. In addition, the
   life-history traits of copper rockfish such as live-bearing of young,
   internal fertilization, short-pelagic larval stages, fidelity to
   habitat and physical isolation due to current and water residence times
   in Puget Sound proper and North Puget Sound, provide isolating
   mechanisms that are consistent with a relatively high degree of genetic
   structure in copper rockfish populations. These physical
   characteristics were utilized as evidence of the significance of the
   populations in that they provide unusual or unique habitat features not
   experienced by other copper rockfish populations.

               The BRT also agreed that genetic evidence points to a
   possible separate northern Puget Sound DPS for copper rockfish.
   Uncertainties do exist with regard to this DPS delineation, however.
   The oceanography of North Puget Sound, Gulf Islands and rest of the
   Georgia Basin is sufficiently restricted from the outer coast to
   reasonably allow reproductive isolation, but it is not as restricted or
   as unique as Puget Sound proper. Also, there are no genetic data for
   the rest of the Georgia Basin, so the question remains as to how Gulf
   Islands fish relate to the rest of the Georgia Basin as well as to the
   coast. Support was given to additional studies aimed at clarifying this
   information in the near future.

                              Risk Conclusions

           The BRT utilized criteria and methods of Wainwright and Kope
   (1999) and Musick et al. (2000) to assist in organizing the information
   presented regarding risk to the Puget Sound proper DPS. Bearing the
   results of the above comparisons in mind, the BRT considered whether
   the Puget Sound proper copper rockfish DPS was in danger of extinction,
   likely to become in danger of extinction, or not likely to become in
   danger of extinction. The majority of the BRT concluded that the Puget
   Sound proper DPS of copper rockfish are neither at risk of extinction
   nor likely to become so. However, most members expressed concern they
   could not entirely rule out the possibility that this species at
   present is likely to become in danger of extinction. The BRT also
   concluded that this DPS met the International Union for the
   Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria to be considered vulnerable
   (Musick et al. 2000). The BRT agreed that populations of this species
   had declined over the last three or four decades, with over_harvesting
   being a likely major factor. Nevertheless, the populations in the DPS
   had appeared to be stable over the last five years, and the lower
   population numbers in this DPS compared to the larger numbers in
   northern Puget Sound are roughly in proportion to the greater amounts
   of kelp and high-relief habitat in North Puget Sound. The BRT
   considered the risk to copper rockfish in North Puget Sound to be no
   greater than the risk to copper rockfish in Puget Sound proper. The BRT
   also expressed caution that important changes in resource management
   practices (e.g., increased harvest levels) and in the ecosystem (e.g.,
   increased numbers of marine mammals or predatory fish species), as well
   as increased habitat degradation, could result in increased extinction
   risk for copper rockfish in this DPS.

                             Quillback Rockfish

                               DPS Delineation

           Members of the BRT considered three possible configurations
   that incorporate greater Puget Sound populations of quillback rockfish.
   The first scenario includes a coastwide DPS that encompasses greater
   Puget Sound. A small minority of the BRT supported this scenario. The
   second DPS configuration includes a coastal and San Juan Islands DPS
   and a Puget Sound proper DPS. A slightly larger, small minority favored
   this scenario. The third configuration is a coastal DPS, a Puget Sound
   proper DPS and a northern Puget Sound DPS which extends into the
   Georgia Basin and toward the coast to an uncertain degree. A majority
   (66%) of the BRT approved of this DPS scenario for quillback rockfish.
   The geographic boundaries of the Puget Sound proper DPS, northern Puget
   Sound DPS and the coastal DPS are shown in Figure 2.

           A variety of evidence was utilized by the BRT to support their
   tentative identification of a Puget Sound proper DPS for quillback
   rockfish. Most was genetic in nature and came from the allele and
   microsatellite work by Seeb (1998), and Wimberger et al. (In prep). BRT
   members also considered that the life-history traits of quillback
   rockfish, such as live-bearing of young, internal fertilization,
   short-pelagic larval stages, fidelity to habitat and physical isolation
   due to current and water residence times in Puget Sound proper, provide
   appropriate isolating mechanisms that would allow a relatively
   high-degree of genetic structure in quillback rockfish populations.
   These life-history traits are evidence of the significance of the
   populations in that it is unusual or unique and differs markedly from
   other populations.

               The boundaries of the northern Puget Sound DPS are not
   certain. It extends to an uncertain degree northward into the Canadian
   portion of the Georgia Basin and its western boundary is provisionally
   placed at Cape Flattery. The BRT concluded that the Puget Sound proper
   quillback rockfish are different from the coast, but beyond Puget Sound
   proper, there is no genetic evidence of structure in the population to
   support differences between the San Juan Islands and the coast.
   However, the similarities of quillback and copper rockfish life
   histories and the oceanographic features of North Puget Sound led the
   BRT to conclude that the isolating mechanisms for copper rockfish
   probably apply to quillback rockfish as well. This led to the
   identification of a northern Puget Sound DPS for quillback rockfish.
   More genetic information is needed to clarify the existence and extent
   of this northern Puget Sound DPS.

                              Risk Conclusions

               The BRT, bearing in mind their deliberations regarding
   risk, using West (1997), Wainwright and Kope (1999), and Musick et al.
   (2000), considered whether the Puget Sound proper DPS of quillback
   rockfish was in danger of extinction, likely to become in danger of
   extinction or not likely to become in danger of extinction. The
   majority of the BRT concluded that the Puget Sound proper DPS of
   quillback rockfish are neither at risk of extinction nor likely to
   become so. However, most members expressed concern that they could not
   rule out the possibility that this species at present is likely to
   become in danger of extinction. The BRT also concluded that this DPS
   met the IUCN criteria to be considered vulnerable. The BRT agreed that
   populations of quillback rockfish had, according to a self-contained
   underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) survey, declined to 14% of its
   1988 size, with over_harvesting being a likely major factor.
   Nevertheless, the populations in the DPS had appeared to be stable over
   the last five years, and the lower population numbers in this DPS
   compared to the larger numbers in North Puget Sound are roughly in
   proportion to the greater amounts of kelp and high-relief habitat in
   North Puget Sound. The BRT considers the risk to quillback rockfish in
   North Puget Sound to be no greater than the risk to quillback rockfish
   in Puget Sound proper. The BRT also expressed the same caution as they
   did with copper rockfish, which is that important changes in resource
   management practices (e.g., increased harvest levels) and in the
   ecosystem (e.g., increased numbers of marine mammals or predatory fish
   species), as well as increased habitat degradation, could result in
   increased extinction risk for this species in Puget Sound proper and in
   North Puget Sound.

                               Brown Rockfish

                               DPS Delineation

               Two possible configurations were considered by the BRT that
   incorporate greater Puget Sound populations of brown rockfish. The
   first is a coastwide DPS that includes greater Puget Sound. None of the
   BRT considered that this describes the appropriate scale for the DPS.
   The second scenario includes a coastal DPS, and a Puget Sound proper
   DPS. All members of the BRT supported this second DPS delineation (Fig.
   3). As with quillback and copper rockfish, the geographic boundaries of
   the Puget Sound proper DPS are the area south of Admiralty Inlet and
   east of Deception Pass. Unlike copper and quillback rockfish, brown
   rockfish are uncommon in North Puget Sound. The few brown rockfish
   found outside of Puget Sound proper and inland of Cape Flattery are
   considered to most likely represent vagrant brown rockfish from the
   Puget Sound proper DPS.

               The BRT identified a variety of evidence to support a Puget
   Sound proper DPS for brown rockfish. Genetic evidence comes from work
   by Seeb (1998). Brown rockfish have somewhat different life history and
   habits than do quillback and copper rockfish. However, key life-history
   traits, that would contribute to isolation of copper and quillback
   rockfish, are true of brown rockfish as well. These traits include
   live-bearing of young, internal fertilization, and short-pelagic larval
   stages. Physical isolation due to current and water residence times in
   Puget Sound proper also provide an isolating mechanism that is
   consistent with a relatively high-degree of genetic structure in brown
   rockfish populations in Puget Sound proper. The distribution of brown
   rockfish is also important in that it occurs in Puget Sound proper with
   a large geographical disjunction between greater Puget Sound and
   Oregon. This makes it a possible remnant population in ecologically
   unique habitats when compared to the California population (those that
   have been sampled for genetic work). BRT members were confident that,
   based on genetic information, this Puget Sound proper DPS is different
   from the coastal DPS, although the extent of the coastal DPS is
   unknown.

                              Risk Conclusions

               The BRT used methods and criteria from Wainwright and Kope
   (1999) and Musick et al. (2000) to organize information regarding risk
   to the Puget Sound proper DPS of brown rockfish. They considered
   whether the species was in danger of extinction, likely to become in
   danger of extinction or not likely to become in danger of extinction. A
   majority of the BRT concluded that brown rockfish in Puget Sound proper
   are neither at risk of extinction nor likely to become so. Factors in
   this decision included the increasing numbers of brown rockfish
   observed in SCUBA surveys in central Puget Sound proper during the
   late-1990s, stable estimated population sizes observed in trawl surveys
   in the main stem of Puget Sound proper during the 1990s, and the
   increased relative percent of brown rockfish in the composition of
   recreationally-caught rockfish during the late-1990s. Moreover, brown
   rockfish are more habitat generalists than quillback and copper
   rockfish and consume a wider range of prey species, making them more
   adaptable to the types of intertidal and subtidal habitats and
   associated food organisms available in the DPS. However, most members
   also expressed concern that they could not entirely rule out the
   possibility that this species is at present likely to become in danger
   of extinction. The BRT also concluded that this DPS met the IUCN
   criteria to be considered vulnerable. The BRT considered brown rockfish
   in North Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca to be associated
   with the Puget Sound proper DPS and to be vagrants from that DPS. The
   BRT expressed the same caution as they did with copper and quillback
   rockfish, that important changes in resource management practices
   (e.g., increased harvest levels) and in the ecosystem (e.g., increased
   numbers of marine mammals or predatory fish species), as well as
   increased habitat degradation, could result in increased risk of
   extinction for brown rockfish in greater Puget Sound.

             Consideration of the Greater Puget Sound Ecosystem

               It is important to note that the BRT's considerations of
   the status and trends of brown rockfish, copper rockfish and quillback
   rockfish in the greater Puget Sound did not, and should not, occur in a
   vacuum. In addition to these three species, several other fish species
   from this area have either been listed under the ESA, or have been
   petitioned for listing. These include over 20 ESUs of salmon and
   steelhead along the West Coast, Pacific herring, Pacific cod, Pacific
   hake, and walleye pollock -- all in or close to the greater Puget Sound
   area. A significance emerges from consideration of these species
   collectively that is not apparent when any one is considered alone.
   Joint consideration of these species together suggests ecosystem-level
   implications that are difficult or impossible to evaluate under terms
   of the ESA. It is possible, hypothetically, that the reduced or
   declining trends of each of the individual species in this group could
   be considered as insufficient for affording that species legal
   protection under the ESA. But taking no action, under such
   circumstances, might be a major mistake if this collective information
   is an indication that the greater Puget Sound area, as an ecosystem, is
   experiencing major change. Such changes could be of more far-ranging
   concern than could ever be recognized if any one species were
   considered individually.

               Environmental variation, and general ecosystem dynamics,
   could easily lead to at least some of the declines in abundance
   observed for any one of these species. However, the BRT found the
   commonalities and synchronous nature of the information to be
   compelling. Scientifically, this raises the need to determine the
   degree to which these common changes are anthropogenic, both for
   individual species and within the greater Puget Sound ecosystem as a
   whole. The complexity of factors responsible for population
   fluctuations emphasizes the need for better understanding of the unique
   features of greater Puget Sound compared to surrounding and similar
   environments, many of which are interconnected with the Sound via such
   things as the climate, currents, migrations, and dispersal of various
   species. The BRT felt that it was important to understand the natural
   variation within such systems over various time scales from decades to
   thousands of years. The potential for stratigraphic sediment analysis
   was noted in this regard, as were studies of the dynamics of species
   compared across the observed diversity of life-history strategies.
   Measures of the ebb and flow, or the extinction, recolonization, and
   persistence of the populations of the various species in the greater
   Puget Sound ecosystem were also considered important as a basis for
   judging to what degree the adverse changes are of anthropogenic
   origins, and how significant these changes are as a basis for taking
   management action. In the absence of such information, the BRT was
   restricted to a largely species by species consideration of the data.
