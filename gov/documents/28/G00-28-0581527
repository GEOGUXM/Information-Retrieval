   The State of California has a commitment to provide services and
   supports to individuals with developmental disabilities throughout
   their lifetime. These services and supports are provided through a
   combination of federal, state, county and local government services,
   private businesses, support groups and volunteers.

   The Department of Developmental Services provides leadership and
   funding for these services and supports through state-operated
   developmental centers and contracts with twenty-one agencies called
   regional centers. The regional centers have offices throughout
   California to provide a local resource to help find and access the many
   services available to individuals with developmental disabilities and
   their families.
