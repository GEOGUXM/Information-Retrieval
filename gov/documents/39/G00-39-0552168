   The purpose of this body of activity within the Automotive Systems and
   Technology Department is to develop, extend, refine, and utilize
   computer models and databases to assist in the assessment of advanced
   powertrain and battery system concepts, and in the interpretation of
   test data reported to the automobile community. This activity also
   evaluates and lends meaning to data collected in laboratory and field
   tests. Data from extensive laboratory and field-testing efforts, are
   contained in a comprehensive database accessable via the World Wide
   Web.

   The principal vehicle modeling tool developed at the INEEL is SIMPLEV^速
   and is used in the analyses of all-electric and hybrid-electric powered
   vehicles. SIMPLEV^速 is a comprehensive data-driven computer model which
   is run on any IBM compatible PC. Dynamometer and battery test data are
   routinely compared with the simulation model to validate the simulation
   and to better understand laboratory test results. This computer program
   is widely used by researchers in academia and industry and is regarded
   as a valuable engineering and analytical tool.

   SIMPLEV^速 Version 3.1 is available free of charge under licensing
   arrangements with Bechtel B&W Idaho, LLC, the operating contractor of
   the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. To learn
   more about this electric and hybrid vehicle simulation software follow

   Other analyses are aided by special purpose simulations developed for
   specific studies. INEEL's analyses of the probable effect of
   ultracapacitor/battery and high-power-density/high-energy-density power
   sources are a result of these special purpose computer simulations.

   These computer tools are also used to construct appropriate battery
   tests which closely simulate the operating regime of electric and
   hybrid vehicle batteries for which actual test data are unavailable.
   The development of the cyclic Dynamic Stress Test profile specified by
   the United States Advanced Battery Consortium, various High Power
   Battery and Ultracapacitor Load Leveling Test Cycles are examples of of
   the integration of the Automotive Systems and Technology Department's
   computer simulation and testing activities.
