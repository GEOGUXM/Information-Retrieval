  Cool Robot Of The Week

   The honor of being listed as "Cool Robot Of The Week" is bestowed upon
   those robotics-related web sites which portray highly innovative
   solutions to robotics problems, describe unique approaches to
   implementing robotics system, or present exciting interfaces for the
   dissemination of robotics-related information or promoting robotics
   technology. This award carries absolutely no monetary value, official
   recognition, assumed support, or tangible benefit, other than swamping
   your web site with a few dozen extra hits for a week. But everyone else
   was putting up their "Cool Site Of The Millenia" lists, so we figured
   it was our turn too...
