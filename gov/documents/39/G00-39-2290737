   IT Support Center - Computer and Personnel Move Requests

      UNDER REVIEW!!!!

      The Move Coordinator will contact the IT Support Center via web, e-mail
      or phone for five or less moves.  An email or Service Request is
      recommended for 6 or more moves.  The IT Support Center will prompt the
      user for the date approved by Facilities and the name of the Facilities
      personnel that approved the move.  This data will be recorded in the
      ticket.  Without this data, a move request cannot be processed.

      The following information is required to initiate a move request:
        * The identification information for the seat (ECN for equipment or
          Phone Number for telephone)
        * User(s) Name
        * Code Network desired
        * Current Location and New Location
        * Date of the Move

      A move ticket is entered in to the system and a ticket number is
      assigned.

      If the request is not obtained via telephone, acknowledgement is sent
      to the requestor via e-mail.

      SAIC ODIN Hardware/Software team completes the move and closes the
      ticket.

      An e-mail is automatically generated, sent to the requestor with a URL
      pointing to the Customer Satistaction Survey.

      The user completes the survey and submits the survey for processing.

      For more information, please contact  the IT Support Center at NASA HQ,
      Local, National, and International Direct Toll Free: 358-HELP (4357)
