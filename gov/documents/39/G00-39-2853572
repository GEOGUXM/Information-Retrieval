   District Profile



     About the 2nd District of Virginia
     Virginia's 2nd Congressional District consists of the City of Virginia
   Beach, a center for white-collar, suburban military families and
   retirees, and parts of the City of Norfolk where many military retirees
   and blue-collar families reside.
   Virginia Beach is the largest city in Virginia, but its tourism-driven
   population boom of the 1980s is over.  However, the area has held its
   ground in the face of military base closings. In fact, one base added
   5,000 new employees. The Norfolk Naval Base, the largest in the world,
   continues to dominate the economy, which also is bolstered by
   shipbuilding and shipping companies. The Hampton Roads port is the
   world's biggest shipper of coal.  Norfolk has invested heavily in urban
   renewal projects which are transforming it into a city for the 21st
   Century.
