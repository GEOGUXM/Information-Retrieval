   [es-airplane.jpg] Crystal, Minnesota based North Hennepin Squadron
   (Unit NCR-MN-017) is one of 1,700 Civil Air Patrol (CAP) units in the
   United States of America. Congressionally chartered as the United
   States Air Force Auxiliary, the 60,000 volunteer members have access to
   a fleet of over 500 aircraft and 950 ground vehicles in order to carry
   out CAP's 4 primary noncombatant missions:
     * Search and Rescue / Disaster Relief is what CAP is best known for.
       When called upon by the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center
       (AFRCC), CAP members search for emergency locator transmitters
       (ELTs) and/or for missing aircraft. These Emergency Services
       missions are conducted by our air crews, grounds teams and
       combinations thereof. CAP has an extensive radio communications
       capability for use during missions and administrative purposes.
     * Cadet Training Program designed to educate young men and women in
       the ideals of leadership and service through Air Force style
       training, discipline and education. Similar to ROTC, CAP cadet
       officers "run" the cadet program under the supervision of specified
       senior officers. Qualified cadets also participate in actual or
       training missions; in fact, they form the bulk of our ground teams.
     * Aerospace Education is repeatedly provided to both CAP members and
       the general public.
     * Counter Drug (CD) support is provided by CAP to state and federal
       law enforcement agencies. This important mission primarily entails
       the transport of equipment, evidence or law enforcement officers.
       The Posse Comitatus Act was designed to limit direct active use the
       military by civil law enforcement officers to enforce laws. It
       prohibits direct participation by military personnel in civilian
       searches, seizures, arrests and other similar activities unless
       expressly authorized by law. As part of the United States Air
       Force, CAP Members are governed by this act when involved in a CAP
       mission.

   [nhs-patch.gif] CAP today remains the only organization whose members
   are official, non-combatant members of the United States Air Force. If
   you are interested in continuing this proud tradition, and if this type
   of activity and volunteer service appeals to you, we would like to
   invite you to our weekly meeting held each Tuesday at our Crystal
   Airport based Squadron Headquarters. Cadet and Senior Member meeting
   times as well as directions to the unit can be found on this web
   site...
