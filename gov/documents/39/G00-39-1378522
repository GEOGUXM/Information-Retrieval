   will sponsor the U.S. Pavilion at COMDEX IT France 2002. The Office of
   Information Technologies at USDOC headquarters in Washington, DC will
   work jointly in support of the Pavilion.
   The U.S. Pavilion will serve as a focal point, as well as offer

   corporate and government decision makers in the European IT
   marketplace. To learn more about the U.S. Pavilion at COMDEX IT 2002
