   Thermal / Vacuum Chambers
   Building 144
   The ETL has numerous horizontal thermal vacuum chambers ranging in size
   from 3' by 3' up to 11' by 11' in diameter. These chambers are capable
   of providing an outer space environment of better than 1 x 10e-7 Torr
   at Â–185 C. The ETL also has several vacuum bakeout chambers which are
   capable of attaining high vacuum conditions at temperatures of over 100
   C. The facility has staff   experts in the fields of helium leak
   checking, molecular contamination monitoring, cryogenics and high
   vacuum technology. The ETL uses state-of-the-art helium cryo and
   turbomolecular pumping systems to provide an ultra clean vacuum
   environment for sensitive optical space flight instruments.
