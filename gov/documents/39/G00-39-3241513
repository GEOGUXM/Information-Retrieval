   Review and the NASDA Research Foundation The National Association of
   State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) is a nonprofit association of
   public officials representing the Commissioners, Secretaries, and
   Directors of Agriculture in the fifty states and four territories. The
   NASDA Research Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, tax-exempt
   corporation for education and scientific purposes. This review was
   funded in part from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
   Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), cooperative
   agreement number 019 114 0531 CA. NASDARF The contents and views

   Foundation The NASDA mission is to represent the state departments of
   agriculture in the development, implementation, and communication of
   sound public policy and programs which support and promote the American
   agriculture industry, while protecting consumers and the environment.
   To assist in this mission, NASDA established and incorporated the NASDA
   Research Foundation in Washington, DC to provide agriculturally
   oriented research, education, and training. The Foundation received its
   designation as a 501 (c)(3) not-for-profit organization from the
   Internal Revenue Service on September 10, 1981. Mission Statement:
