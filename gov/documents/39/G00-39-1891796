                  Investigatory Interview Procedure banner

   If you are an IRS bargaining unit employee and are being interviewed by
   a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA)
   investigator, TIGTA believes that you should know what to expect in an
   interview, and what is expected of you. The following is a list of
   procedures that TIGTA generally follows when conducting interviews of
   bargaining unit employees.

                                   3/1/2000
   1. Any bargaining unit employee who is the subject of an investigation,
       or who is being interviewed as a third party witness, and who
       reasonably believes that an interview with a TIGTA investigator may
       result in disciplinary action by IRS has the right, upon request,
       to representation by a person designated by the Union.
       2. Absent concerns about an individuals personal safety or other
       specific investigative concerns, TIGTA investigators will contact
       an employees manager to schedule an interview with an employee. At
       the time of the contact, the investigator will advise the
       employees manager of the general subject of the interview,
       including whether the interview involves criminal or non-criminal
       matters, if known. The investigator will also generally advise the
       manager if the employee is the subject of an investigation or a
       third party witness.
       3. If TIGTA investigators contact the employee directly to schedule
       the interview, the investigator will inform the employee of those
       matters in paragraph 2, above, in addition to the following:

   (a) that if the employee reasonably believes that the interview may
       result in disciplinary action, the employee is entitled to
       representation during the interview by a person designated by the
       Union; and,
       (b) that the interview will be scheduled to allow the employee an
       opportunity to seek the counsel of a Union representative, provided
       that this does not unduly delay the interview.

   4. If the employee is being interviewed as the subject of the
   investigation and fails to bring an executed IRS Form 8111 to the
   interview, the TIGTA investigator will give the employee a copy of the
   form to execute or instruct the employee to retrieve the original Form
   8111. The employee will execute Form 8111 and provide the original form
   to the TIGTA investigator prior to the interview. The employee shall be
   given a copy of the executed Form 8111.

   5. If the employee is being interviewed as a third party witness, the
   TIGTA investigator will provide the employee with IRS Form 9142 before
   beginning the interview. When an employee is provided Form 9142, the
   employee shall acknowledge receipt and be given a copy of the executed
   form.

   6. If the interview is employee-initiated, there is no obligation to
   inform the employee of the right to Union representation before
   beginning the interview. If, however, at any time during the interview,
   the TIGTA investigator should reasonably believe that the information
   offered by the employee could result in discipline of the employee, the
   employee must then be advised of his or her right to Union
   representation.

   7. If an employee appears for a scheduled interview without Union
   representation and reasonably believes, because the subject matter of
   the interview has changed, that disciplinary action may result, the
   employee may request a brief delay to secure Union representation.

   8. If an employee is represented in an interview and the subject matter
   of the interview changes to matters over which the employee and the
   representative have not conferred, the employee or the representative
   may request a brief recess to confer on such issues.

   9. When scheduling an interview with an employee who is the subject of
   an investigation, the TIGTA investigator will inform the employee of
   the general nature of the matter and whether it concerns criminal or
   administrative misconduct. In cases solely involving administrative
   misconduct, if the employee refuses to respond to questions, the
   employee shall be advised of the following:

   Pursuant to 214.1 of IRM 0735.1, when directed to do so by TIGTA or
       other competent Treasury or Internal Revenue Service authority,
       employees must testify or respond to questions in matters of
       official interest. Employees must give such testimony, or respond
       to questions, under oath when required or requested to do so. Your
       failure to respond as required may result in severe discipline
       including removal.

   10. At the outset of a custodial interview regarding possible criminal
   conduct of an employee who is the subject of the investigation, the
   TIGTA investigator shall give the employee a statement of Miranda
   rights contained on IRS Form 5228. If the employee waives his or her
   rights, the employee shall so indicate by signing the Form 5228, and
   shall be given a copy of the executed form.

   11. When the subject of an investigation is being interviewed regarding
   possible criminal conduct and the interview is non-custodial, at the
   beginning of the interview the TIGTA investigator shall give the
   employee a statement of rights contained in Form 5230.^ 1
   12. In an interview involving possible criminal conduct where
       prosecution has been declined by appropriate authority, at the
       beginning of the interview the TIGTA investigator shall give the
       employee a statement of the Kalkines warning. The warning shall
       contain the following language:

   You are here to be asked questions pertaining to your employment with
       the Internal Revenue Service and the duties that you perform for
       the IRS. You have the option to remain silent, although you may be
       subject to removal from your employment by the Service if you fail
       to answer material and relevant questions relating to the
       performance of your duties as an employee. You are further advised
       that the answers you may give to the questions propounded to you at
       this interview, or any information or evidence which is gained by
       reason of your answers, may not be used against you in a criminal
       proceeding except that you may be subject to a criminal prosecution
       for any false answer that you may give.

   When employees are given the Kalkines warning, they shall be given IRS
   Form 8112. Employees will acknowledge on IRS Form 8112 the receipt of
   the above warning. Employees shall be given a copy of the executed IRS
   Form 8112 for their own records.

   13. When the person being interviewed is accompanied by a Union
   representative, the representatives role in both criminal and
   non-criminal cases includes, but is not limited to, the following
   rights:

           a. to clarify the questions;

           b. to clarify the answers;

           c. to assist the employee in providing favorable or extenuating
   facts;

           d. to suggest other employees who have knowledge of relevant
   facts; and,

           e. to advise the employee.

   A representative may not transform the interview into an adversarial
   contest.

   14. Once it is determined that an investigation is not criminal in
   nature or once prosecution is declined, the Union and the employee may
   request a reasonable delay of the interview. The request shall not be
   unreasonably denied.

   15. Either party may manually and/or mechanically record TIGTA
   interviews. The role of any person other than employees or their
   representatives in the recording of the interview shall be subject to
   applicable confidentiality provisions. The recording may not
   unreasonably delay the interview. An employee who chooses to record an
   interview must provide TIGTA personnel with advance notice of the
   decision to record sufficient to permit the TIGTA investigator to
   arrange for TIGTA to record the interview.

   16. If TIGTA investigators have determined to use a Statement Analysis
   Questionnaire in an investigation, employees are entitled to utilize
   all applicable provisions of these procedures, if appropriate, that
   apply to the subjects of investigations, including Miranda and
   Kalkines.

   17. As prescribed by the Privacy Act (and only in non-criminal
   matters), TIGTA investigators shall endeavor to collect information,
   where practicable, directly from the subject individual if the
   information may result in adverse determinations about an individuals
   rights, benefits and privileges under federal programs.

   18. In interviews regarding possible criminal conduct when the employee
   interviewed is represented by counsel, and when the TIGTA investigator
   is on reasonable notice of such representation, the employees counsel
   shall have authority to represent the employee during the interview.
   TIGTA investigators on reasonable notice of such representation shall
   not initiate ex parte communication with the employee.
