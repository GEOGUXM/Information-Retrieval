   Keeping Washington's Business Climate Healthy

   Washington enjoys one of the strongest state economies in the nation.
   But we must improve our competitive edge to ensure a healthy business
   climate that continues to create the family wage jobs that Washington's
   people and economy thrive on.

   Working with business, labor and the Legislature, Gov. Gary Locke has
   led efforts to make Washington a place where businesses want to locate
   or expand. He's cut more than $1 billion in businesses taxes, worked to
   expand and promote exports, advanced workforce training, and invested
   in rural economic development.

   The governor also recognizes that in a rapidly changing global economy,
   the state must keep pace with changes necessary to keep and improve its
   competitive edge. With the goal of ensuring a vibrant future for
   Washington's economy, he has formed the Washington Competitiveness
   Council to recommend reforms that can ensure a thriving,
   environmentally sustainable business climate.

   The Washington Competitiveness Council will:
     * Address key business climate issues, using the October 2000 report
       of the Alliance for a Competitive Economy (ACE) as the starting
       point for this discussion.
     * Make the public more keenly aware of the importance of a healthy
       business climate to the future of Washington's economy.
     * Engage the business community in advancing a competitiveness
       agenda.
     * Strengthen state and local governments' ability to respond to
       business community needs.
