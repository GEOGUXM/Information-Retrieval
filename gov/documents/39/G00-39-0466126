  July 2001 Update on Cadet Orientation Flight Program

   You should somewhat ignore the article in the July 2001 CAP News
   regarding the new cadet orientation flight program. I just spoke with
   the Chief of Curriculum Development at National Headquarters,
   Lieutenant Colonel Rob Smith. Lt Col Smith and his staff have clarified
   that we should use the new CAP Forms 7 and 7T, but it is not yet
   mandatory. Also, the new program will not be in effect until, at least,
   October. With the start of the new program, will come another revision
   of the CAP Forms 7 and 7T because of other issues that will be tracked
   by way of the new forms. Start to collect and track fuel receipts now.
   Though you will not send receipts to wing with the current program, you
   must do so upon your participation in the new program. Just think,
   actual reimbursement for all of your orientation flight fuel consumed.
   Watch and listen for the new program before you start to use it. Check
   out this web address for the update from HQ CAP.
   http://www.capnhq.gov/nhq/cp/cpc/Changes/cof1.htm
   To summarize, continue to use the new forms, but stick with the old
   orientation flight syllabus. If you wish, you may use the old CAPF 7,
   but you should endeavor to use the new CAPF's 7 and 7T.

   If you have any questions, please contact me by phone or
   e-mail--numbers and address below.

   Thank you all for your enthusiasm and efforts to make Washington Wing's
   cadet program the best it can be. Things are only getting better for
   the Air Force Auxiliary.

   The unit commander will forward their selection (on a CAP Form 120 with

   Headquarters at (a copy will also be sent to the Group and Wing
   Headquarters):

   Veterans of Foreign Wars

   Kansas City MO 64111

   The complete mailing address and telephone number of the unit commander
   will be provided for the convenience of the local VFW officials in
   contacting the CAP squadron concerned. The VFW Headquarters will
   prepare the award elements and forward them to the unit for
   presentation. If at all possible, a VFW representative should present
   the award.

   There currently is no suspense date for submitting your requests for
   recognition. Do not forward your applications to national headquarters
   (this would only slow down the process of recognizing your deserving
   cadets).
