Zone, State, and Short Term Forecasts

   Zone and Short-Term Forecasts for Michigan (text) (map showing the
   county zone numbers)
   The National Weather Service Office in Grand Rapids has come up with an
   image map of Michigan that gives you one click access to the Short term
   forecast, the Zone forecast, and the extended forecast all on one page.
   This is a real neat presentation and I would recommend using this as
   your primary means of getting the forecast. If you do not want to use
   the image map, the following table will help to get the forecast for
   counties in Southeast Lower Michigan...
