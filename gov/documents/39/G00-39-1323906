Factsheet Highlight
ATP Fills Gap Left by Venture Capitalists

   The Advanced Technology Program funds high-risk technologies that would
   likely not be developed because funding in the private sector is not
   available and which have potentially large benefits to the nation.

What is the Funding Gap? Between invention and innovation...

     * The United States system of university-and national lab-based basic
       research is the best in the world. These labs are funded in large
       part by the federal government.
     * There is a class of technologies that are not yet developed enough
       for private sector investment, but are "too commercial" to
       sufficiently interest the universities or national labs, says David
       Morganthaler, a venture capitalist who has been active since the
       late 1960s.
     * Between basic research and product development, or to borrow a
       phrase from Prof. Lewis Branscomb at Harvard University, "between
       invention and innovation, our system does not seem to work as
       well." This is the Funding Gap.

Why is there a Funding Gap?

     * Venture capital funds raised approximately $103 billion dollars in
       2000, up dramatically from $2.5 billion in 1991. Most of this money
       goes into product development and business developmentÂ—very little
       goes into early-stage research.
     * Venture capitalists are funding larger projects for efficiency
       reasons. It takes about as much work to identify and monitor a $1
       million dollar investment as it does a $10 million investment.
       Thus, venture capitalists are not as interested in opportunities
       requiring lower dollar amounts.
     * Since 1990 the average deal size has grown to $15.5 million from
       $2.5 million.
     * David Morganthaler says "when we invest in Nobel prize winning
       research, we do it by mistake" and that venture capitalists should
       "very rarely invest in enabling technology." Venture capitalists,
       he says, should not investment in early-stage, high risk technology
       research.

What does ATP do that Venture Capitalists do not do?

     * Venture capital money remains concentrated in two regions of the
       country.
          + Northern California accounted for 33% of venture capital
            investments.
          + The New York/New England area accounted for 22% of venture
            capital investments (2001, Venture Source).
          + Most venture capitalists are unwilling to consider an
            investment more than a few hours travel away, because they
            would not be able to easily monitor it.
     * ATP has projects in 40 states and the District of Columbia.
     * Venture capital is concentrated in two technology areas:
          + Computer-related companies received 86% of venture funding in
            2000.
          + By contrast, such important areas as industrial/energy
            companies received only 1% of venture funding (2001, Venture
            Source).
     * ATP divides its funds across a wide variety of important
       technologies*:
          + Electronics: 24%
          + Information technology: 24%
          + Materials and chemistry: 22%
          + Biotechnology: 17%
          + Manufacturing: 13%
            ATP divides its funds across a wide variety of important
            technologies
     * ATP funds early-stage, high risk technologies. ATP does NOT fund
       business development or commercialization.
     * The "bottom line" for ATP is national economic benefit. The "bottom
       line" for a venture capitalist is the direct monetary return on
       their investment.

Factsheet Highlight
ATP Accelerates Technology Development

   ATP project participants indicate that they are significantly ahead in
   their R&D cycle as a result of ATP funding as compared with where they
   would be without their ATP award.

   Approximately nine out of ten organizations indicate that ATP funding
   accelerated their R&D cycle.* Of those organizations indicating they
   were ahead in the R&D cycle:

     * Twenty-five percent indicate that there would be no project without
       ATP funding.
     * Thirteen percent indicate that they are ahead by less than a year.
     * Fifty-three percent indicate that they are ahead by one to three
       years.
     * Seven percent indicate that they are more than three years ahead.
     * Two percent indicate that they are not sure how much they are
       ahead.

   ATP participants report that the acceleration of R&D will reduce the
   time it will take to bring products to market or to implement new
   production processes. Reduction in time-to-market by two years or more
   is anticipated for about three out of five planned commercial
   applications.

Factsheet Highlight
ATP Fosters Collaboration ^(1)

   Approximately 85 percent of ATP participants indicate that their
   project involves collaboration with other organizations including
   companies, universities, and other research organizations. Of those
   involved in collaborations:
     * Two out of three indicate that ATP is responsible for the
       collaboration to a great extent.
     * About 90 percent indicate that ATP is responsible to a moderate or
       great extent.

   At least 80 percent of the participants involved in these ATP
   collaborations indicate that collaboration enabled the following^(2):
     * Provision of R&D expertise that their company lacks.
     * Accelerated product entry into the marketplace.
     * Saved time.
     * Stimulated creative thinking.
     * Encouraged future collaborations.

   Collaborations also improved other areas of work, including:
     * Identifying customer needs for about three out of four
       participants.
     * Ensuring a reliable/quality source of supply and saving on labor
       cost for about half of the participants.
     * Planning for manufacturing during the R&D phase and saving on
       equipment costs for more than 40 percent of the participants.

   The cost of R&D collaboration appears relatively insignificant for the
   majority of the ATP participants. Of those involved in collaborations:
     * Four out of five participants indicate little to no delay in
       beginning their R&D.
     * Nearly half of the participants reported that project coordination
       and management costs had increased moderately as a result of
       collaboration, but only 8 percent reported a significant cost
       increase.
     * About nine out of ten participants indicate little to no delay for
       product entry into the marketplace while involved in ATP
       collaborations.

   Similar collaboration effects were previously reported in the April
   2000 publication (NISTIR 6491) entitled "Development,
   Commercialization, and Diffusion of Enabling Technologies: Progress
   Report." Although two and a half years passed between the two sets of
   data, collaboration and its enabling effects are quite consistent.

Factsheet Highlight
Time to Commercialization Differs
Across Technologies ^(1)

Timing of expected revenues vary

     * Across all applications, revenues are expected:
          + For one out of five applications by the end of ATP funding.
          + For two out of five applications within a year after ATP
            funding ends.
          + For four out of five applications within three years after ATP
            funding ends.
     * Technology affects timing of revenues. Information technology (IT)
       applications are anticipated to earn revenues very quickly.

     * By the end of ATP funding, 27 percent earn revenues.
     * Within another year, 54 percent earn revenues.

     Materials-chemicals and manufacturing applications are anticipated to
   be the slowest to earn revenues. These applications are expected to lag
   IT applications by about a year.
     * By the end of ATP funding, 8 percent and 12 percent, respectively
       earn revenues.
     * By two years after ATP funding, 54 percent and 57 percent,
       respectively earn revenues.

     Early biotechnology applications follow the "average" in the early
   years, but there is a noticeable second peak five or more years out.

Industry Factors May Account for the Differences

     * Biotechnologies and information technologies are "young" and often
       help form new industries.

     * Companies are typically young and product markets are essentially
       new.
     * Focus is on achieving basic functionality and performance.
     * Early opportunities for service applications (e.g., research and
       testing services for biotechnology and custom software development
       and installation for information technology) are useful for market
       recognition and validation.
     * Early cash flows are earned, but generally do not generate big
       revenues or the economic impact anticipated for therapeutic markets
       or for broadly distributed software.
     * Biotechnologies aimed at human therapeutics often require
       considerable technology development beyond ATP, extensive
       regulatory testing and trials, and production and distribution
       licenses with larger companies before they can make a major impact.

     Manufacturing and chemicals projects typically develop new process
   technologies for existing classes of products in mature,
   commodity-oriented industries.
     * Focus is manufacturability and cost to gain advantage in
       "cents-per-pound," high-volume markets.
     * Capital investment and validation requirements are costly and
       lengthy.
     * Product life cycles and market windows are longer than for IT or
       electronics products.
     * Technological change for commodities occurs more slowly than in
       high-value product areas.

     Electronics' and materials' projects tend to involve a mix of young
   and mature industries.
     * Product applications are more common than process applications.
     * Cost and manufacturability are critical technical and business
       objectives.
     * Electronics product markets are extremely competitive, product life
       cycles are very short, and capital requirements are often steep
       barriers to market entry.

Diffusion Pathways for ATP-Funded
Photonics Technologies

Highlights from presentation on "Diffusion Pathways for Photonics
Technologies," by Todd Watkins and Theodore Schlie

Photonics is the combination of light and electronics

     * Photonics technologies are enabling technologies. Applications
       include:

     * Communications (fiber optics).
     * Computers (displays, storage devices, and scanners).
     * Manufacturing (laser machining and sensors).
     * Medical (laser surgery, imaging, and biophotonics).

     The photonics industry is large and growing rapidly.
     * The photonics industry had worldwide sales of about $150B in late
       1990s, comparable in size to the semiconductor industry or aircraft
       industry.
     * The photonics market grew approximately 20 percent per year in the
       1990s.
     * Market projections indicate that growth is accelerating.

     Diffusion of technology depends heavily on personal communications.
     * Geographic and social distance lead to clusters of diffusion.

     Diffusion of Displaytech's ATP-funded technology is strongly tied to
   the University of Colorado and strongly concentrated geographically.
   Universities are often nodes of diffusion.
     * Displaytech, which produces microdisplays or "displays on a chip,"
       was founded in 1984 on the basis of technology developed at
       University of Colorado, Boulder.
     * Twenty-five of thirty-two Displaytech patents resulted from
       projects that received federal funding.
     * Twenty-five percent of patent citations to Displaytech patents come
       from companies with known links to the University of Colorado.
     * One-third of the patent citations to Displaytech by U.S. companies
       are from companies in Colorado; another one-third of the patent
       citations to Displaytech by U.S. companies are from northern
       California.
     * Nearly half of all scientific publications citing Displaytech are
       by authors affiliated with the University of Colorado.

Factsheet Highlight
ATP Award Leads to "Halo Effect" and
Pursuit of R&D in the Public Interest

Highlights from "Winning an Award from the Advanced Technology Program:
Pursuing R&D Strategies in the Public Interest and Benefiting from a Halo
Effect," by Maryann Feldman and Maryellen Kelley

ATP award produces a "halo effect"

     * An award from ATP may provide a certification function that
       validates the quality of the project and the firm, and favorably
       disposes other public and private organizations to provide
       additional funding.
     * All else being equal, a firm that wins an ATP award is more
       successful in securing additional funding from non-ATP sources than
       are non-winners.

     * One-quarter of the award winners in 1998 applied for follow-on
       financing in the year after the award for further work, such as
       product development or other commercialization activity, from
       venture capitalists, angel investors, government agencies, and
       other sources of funding. Nearly three in four were successful.
     * A large proportion of the non-winners in 1998, almost 50 percent,
       sought funding elsewhere, but only one in three were successful.

     ATP award winners have R&D strategies that help deliver public
   benefits from their R&D activities compared with non-winning
   applicants.

     Award winners in 1998 distinguished themselves from non-winners by
   having:
     * A more extensive set of business ties that facilitate the diffusion
       of knowledge and the commercialization process.
     * A tendency towards openness in communications regarding research
       with other firms and institutions.
     * Research projects that are new to the firm.

     * Almost half of the projects proposed by ATP award winners were in
       an area new to the firm compared to only one in five projects of
       non-winning applicants.

     Projects that entail the formation of new R&D collaborations with
   other organizations.
     * Compared to non-winning applicants, award winners were more likely
       to have a principal research partner who was a new collaborator.

ATP awards are a decisive factor as to whether research is even conducted

     * Of the 1998 non-winners, over 60 percent did not proceed with their
       proposed projects in any way.
     * Almost 30 percent of the rest went ahead on a smaller scale, 4
       percent proceeded on a larger scale, and 5 percent went forward on
       the same scale they had proposed to ATP.
     * Nearly half of those that did not proceed in any way went out of
       business.
     * Even non-winners consider the ATP competition process fair.

     * Of the 1998 ATP award winners, 95 percent thought the ATP
       competition process was fair.
     * More significantly, two-thirds of the non-winners said the process
       was fair. Three out of five of the non-winners said they were
       likely to apply to ATP again.

     ATP telephone debriefings to non-winners are helpful.
     * More than three out of five non-winners elected to take part in
       telephone debriefings offered by ATP to give feedback on the
       strengths and weaknesses of proposals that were not selected for an
       award.
     * Almost 70 percent of those who elected to participate in the
       telephone debriefings said the feedback was helpful.

Description of Study

   The study compared the characteristics of projects and firms selected
   by ATP for funding with applicants who were not selected. This study
   examines the behavioral patterns and strategies that distinguish
   award-winning firms from other applicants. The authors surveyed 1998
   applicant firmsÂ—non-winning firms and award winnersÂ—to develop a set of
   indicators that measure the receptivity of an applicant to other firms'
   use of its research results; the extent of the firm's connections to
   the technical and financial resources of other organizations in R&D
   activities; and the potential for the proposed project to generate new
   pathways for disseminating innovation. Published March 2001 (NISTIR
   6577).

ATP Helps Firms Build New Capabilities and a Broader Social Network for
Innovation

Highlights from "Program Design and Firm Success in the Advanced Technology
Program: Joint Venture and Single Participant Projects and University
Participation," by Michael Darby, Lynne Zucker, David Waguespack, and Andrew
Wang

ATP Promotes Social Capital for Industrial Innovation

     * ATP not only provides funding, but also promotes
       "institution-building" for innovation.
     * ATP enhances a firm's social network for R&D by encouraging and
       supporting cooperation and collaboration in R&D across firms,
       academic institutions, federal laboratories, and other
       organizations.

ATP Builds the Social Basis and Context for Innovation

     * Economic interactions are embedded in social relations and
       connections.
     * Close contact among researchers engaged in collaborative R&D
       relaxes boundaries among firms and enables information flow among
       firms, particularly the transfer of tacit knowledge.
     * Personal and organizational interaction provides a basis for trust
       and cooperation, which enables productive collaboration.

Participation in an ATP Project Can Have Wider Positive Effects on the Firm

     * ATP supports novel and frontier R&D projects that enhance a firm's
       broader R&D capability and strategic direction that would not have
       occurred without ATP's support.
     * Firms that participate in ATP projects learn how to collaborate and
       partner with other firms, a benefit that goes beyond the project
       level to the firm level.
     * Developing collaboration and alliance building skills is a critical
       capability for firms in today's business environment.
     * ATP has a positive impact on innovation as measured by the number
       of patents that firms apply for and receive.
