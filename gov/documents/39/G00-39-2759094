     Jason-1 is a joint U.S./French oceanography mission. The spacecraft
   builds on the heritage of the Topex/Poseidon satellite and will be used
        to observe global climate interaction between the sea and the
       atmosphere. Jason 1 will monitor world ocean circulation, study
   interactions of the oceans and atmosphere, improve climate predictions
     and observe events like El Nino. The project is managed by the Jet
         Propulsion Laboratory for NASA and the French space agency.

      NASA's TIMED spacecraft will conduct the first global study of a
    critical region of Earth's atmosphere, known as the mesosphere, lower
      thermosphere and ionosphere. The two-year mission will study the
     influences of the sun as well as humans on this least explored and
   understood region located between 40 - 110 miles (60 - 180 kilometers)
     above the Earth's surface. Data provided by TIMED will improve our
    understanding of this "gateway region" and its effects on satellites,
     communications, and spacecraft re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.
    TIMED is a NASA satellite managed by the Goddard Space Flight Center.
