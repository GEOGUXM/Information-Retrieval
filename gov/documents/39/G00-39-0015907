   Dear Colleague,

   I have recently had the opportunity to talk with our friends and
   colleagues who provide public transportation in the New York and
   Washington D.C. metropolitan areas. These outstanding public servants
   have overcome incredible challenges since the devastation of September
   11^th, and I know you join me in expressing both our deepest sympathy
   for the personal tragedies they have endured and our pride in the
   superb response they have mounted. Despite tremendous demands on their
   time, they were generous enough to share with me some of their own
   "lessons learned" from this experience. I have attached a summary of
   their recommendations (Attachment A) for your use and information.

   While it would be comforting to think that these will be isolated
   events, we all know that each and every one of us must prepare for the
   worst. Many of you have already begun to re-think your security and
   emergency response plans, and others are creating such plans for the
   first time. Regardless of the category in which you may find yourself,
   we at the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) are prepared to assist
   you.

   FTA is arranging to have professional security experts conduct security
   assessments of the 100 largest transit systems. Those who fall into
   this group will be contacted regarding the assessment schedule. These
   assessments are intended to help you identify security threats and
   develop practical solutions to the concerns that are raised.

   In addition, we will be offering two-day, cost-free security awareness
   and training workshops across the country. If you are interested in
   attending a workshop, please either email Jennifer Whalley at
   whalley@volpe.dot.gov or fax the attached information request form
   (Attachment B) to (617) 494-2569, so that we can determine your
   scheduling needs.

   In the meantime, to help you begin or enhance your security efforts, we
   are compiling a Safety and Security Tool Kit for your use. We expect to
   be able to mail these kits to you next week. The kit will include:
     * FTA Services and Publications
     * Practical Security and Emergency Response Advice from New York and
       Washington
     * An Overview of FTAÂ’s Security Assessment Services
     * Key Transit Security Publications
          + Transit System Security Program Planning Guide
          + Transit Security Procedures Guide
          + Transit Security Handbook
          + Critical Incident Management Guidelines
     * TCRP Synthesis Reports
          + TCRP Synthesis 21: Improving Transit Security
          + TCRP Synthesis 27: Emergency Preparedness for Transit
            Terrorism
     * Sample Materials to Increase Public Awareness about Safety and
       Security
     * Resource Guides
          + Transit Safety Institute Courses and Seminars Catalog, October
            2001-Septmeber 2002
          + FTA Office of Safety and Security Publication Resource Guide,
            September 2001
          + Contact List of Organizations
     * Key Intelligent Transportation System Publications
          + Advanced Public Transportation Systems: The State of the Art
            Update 2000
          + ITS Resource Guide 2001

   I hope that having these materials at your fingertips will be helpful
   now and in the future. However, in order to better understand and
   respond to the security-related needs of the transit provider
   community, we need your help, too.

   First, it is imperative that all security incident reports be submitted
   on a timely basis. These reports are important to identify patterns and
   potential threats to transit systems throughout the nation. To report
   any security incident, please call the National Response Center on
   1-800-424-8802; the Center is staffed 24-hours a day.

   Second, we would appreciate your help in completing a voluntary survey
   of security and emergency preparedness planning and practices. The
   survey (Attachment C) can be completed on-line at
   [http://ftateamweb.fta.dot.gov/SecuritySurvey], or mailed to the
   Federal Transit Administration, Office of Safety & Security, 400 7^th
   Street SW, Room 9305, Washington, DC 20590, Attention: Security
   Surveys. We will use your responses to identify technical assistance
   needs and develop more targeted programs.

   Please know that your continued commitment and vigilance is truly
   appreciated by your colleagues at FTA and, certainly, by the people you
   serve every day. You are the key to keeping our communities safe and
   moving.


                                             Sincerely,
                                             Signature of Jennifer L. Dorn
                                             Jennifer L. Dorn
                                             Administrator
