                SBA DISASTER RELIEF TOPS $250 MILLION IN NYC

   NEW YORK – The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has approved
   more than

   $250 million in disaster loans to over 3,100 New York City residents
   and businesses following the World Trade Center attacks, SBA
   Administrator Hector V. Barreto announced today.

   "The Small Business Administration has focused the entire agency in
   this effort to help rebuild the economy of New York City, and we are
   proud to achieve this new milestone in our commitment to keep America
   open for business," Barreto said.

   Due to recent legislative changes, businesses may now qualify for loans
   of up to $10 million, and a two-year deferment on principal and
   interest. The interest rate on these loans is capped at

   4 percent, with a maximum term of 30 years. The deadline to apply for
   Physical Damage Disaster loans is March 11, 2002, and the deadline to
   apply for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) is June 11, 2002.

   SBA, together with its many resource partners – lenders, Small Business
   Development Centers, SCORE and others – have teamed up to assist small
   business recovery in New York.

   "Our partners are doing outstanding work to help these businesses
   recover,"

   Barreto said.

   EIDLs make up the majority—80 percent—of the SBA disaster loans
   approved to small businesses in New York City since September 11^th.
   These working capital loans are available to help small companies
   unable to pay bills or meet normal operating expenses such as payroll
   or accounts payable.

   In addition to EIDLs, businesses of all sizes, nonprofit organizations,
   homeowners and renters located in the declared disaster areas may be
   eligible for loans to fund rebuilding efforts, and cover the costs of
   replacing lost or disaster-damaged personal property.

   For help with the loan application process, visit a disaster recovery
   center or call

   1-800-659-2955. For more information about the SBA’s disaster loan
