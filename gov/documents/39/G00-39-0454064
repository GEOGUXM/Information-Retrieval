       This is a typical output from the ring current - neutral atom
       simulation. The left and middle panels show the equatorial ion
       distribution generated from the Fok's ring current model. The left
       panel plots the differential flux averaged over pitch angles. The
       white circle depicts the 6.6 RE radial distance. The middle panel
       shows the pitch angle anisotropy, with zero value representing
       isotropic distribution, greater than zero perpendicular and less
       than zero field aligned. The right panel is the corresponding
       neutral atom image from the perspective of the IMAGE satellite.
       Dipole field lines of L = 3 and 6.6 at 4 MLTs are overlaid as a
       spatial reference.
