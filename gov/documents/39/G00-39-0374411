     The Space Transportation Directorate at Marshall Space Flight Center
   is the NASA Lead Center for space transportation systems development
   activities. Excluding the Space Shuttle, this directorate manages any
   program or project related to space transportation. The future reusable
   launch vehicles, in-space transportation systems and heavy lift
   vehicles are all a major focus for future space exploration and MSFC's
   Space Transportation Directorate keeps NASA focused on the future with
   these projects. The images contained in this gallery reflect not only
   what has come before in space transportation, but what might have been
   as well as what will be.
