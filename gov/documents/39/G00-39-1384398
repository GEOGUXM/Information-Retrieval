  Common Signs & Signals of a Stress Reaction
   __________________________________________________________________

   You have experienced a traumatic event. Even though the event may be
   over, you may now be experiencing or may experience later, some strong
   emotional or physical reactions. It is very common and quite normal for
   people to experience aftershocks when they have passed through a
   horrible event.

   Sometimes, the emotional aftershocks (for stress reactions) appear
   immediately after the traumatic event. Sometimes they may appear a few
   hours or a few days later. In some cases, weeks or months may pass
   before the stress reactions appear. The signs and symptoms of a stress
   reaction may last days, weeks, months and occasionally longer depending
   on the severity of the traumatic event. With understanding and support
   from your co-workers, family and friends, the stress reactions usually
   pass more quickly. Occasionally, the traumatic event is so painful that
   professional assistance from a counselor may be helpful. This does not
   imply mental illness or weakness but it simply indicates that this
   particular event was just too powerful to manage alone.

   If you have physical symptoms which cause you concern, contact your
   physician.
