   X-38: Crew Return Vehicle


   Artist's concept of the X-38.

   The X-38 fires thrusters in order to leave the International Space
   Station in this artist's concept. Click here for a video.

      With technologies that blaze a trail for future human spacecraft, NASAs
      X-38 project is developing at an unprecedented low cost a prototype
      rescue vehicle that could provide astronauts on the International Space
      Station an immediate return home in an emergency.

      Pushing the Edge: Something New, Something Old

      The X-38 couples a proven shape, taken largely from Air Forces X-24A
      project from the 1970s, with dozens of new technologies the worlds
      largest parafoil parachute; the first all-electric spacecraft controls;
      flight software developed in a quarter of the time required for past
      spacecraft; laser-initiated explosive mechanisms for deploying
      parachutes; and global positioning system-based navigation.


                                                The X-38 and the X-24.


     The X-38, top, gets its shape from the X-24A, top, an experimental
             aircraft from the 1970s. Click here for a 360-degree view.

      An innovative combination of a shape first tested in the 1970s and
      todays latest aerospace technology, the X-38 already is flying in the
      actual conditions in which it must perform. Since 1997, increasingly
      complex, unpiloted atmospheric test flights of the X-38 have been under
      way at the Dryden Flight Research Center in California. An unpiloted
      X-38 space test vehicle, now under construction at the Johnson Space
      Center in Houston, Texas, will fly aboard the space shuttle in 2003 and
      descend to a landing independently. The X-38 is designed to fit the
      unique needs of a space station lifeboat long-term, maintenance-free
      reliability that is always in turnkey condition, ready to provide the
      crew a quick, safe trip home under any circumstance.

      In addition to contributions from companies and NASA centers
      coast-to-coast, international space agencies are participating with the
      United States in the X-38s development. Contributions to the X-38 are
      being made by Germany, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, France, Spain,
      Sweden and Switzerland and 22 companies throughout Europe.
