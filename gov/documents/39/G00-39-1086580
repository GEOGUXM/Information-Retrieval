              National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices
   The Southeast River Forecast Center (SERFC) provides river forecasts to
   18 National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) across the
   Southeastern U.S. and Puerto Rico. The WFOs then have the
   responsibility for issuing hydrologic products for their Hydrologic
   Service Area (HSA) including River Statements, Flood Warnings and Flash
   Flood Warnings using the SERFC data as guidance.

   ! Real-time hydrologic data are considered provisional data. Please be
   aware of the limitations this imposes. We recommend reading U.S.
   Geological Survey Circular 1123: Stream-Gaging Program of the U.S.
   Geological Survey.

NWS river forecasts are based, to a great extent, on data from the U.S.
Geological Survey stream-gaging stations. The USGS operates most of its
 stream gages on a cooperative basis with other Federal, state, and local agenci
es
 that fund individual gaging stations for agency-specific projects or regulatory
 needs.
Reductions in stream-gaging program funds, due to budget reductions for the
USGS or for cooperating agencies, usually require that some stations be
discontinued.

For more information, see the USGS fact sheets, "Stream Gaging and Flood
Forecasting, a partnership of the U.S. Geological Survey and the National
Weather Service" and "Streamflow Information for the Nation.
