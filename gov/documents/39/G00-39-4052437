   Geologic mapping and El Niño:
   Landslide and debris-flow susceptibility maps
   __________________________________________________________________

   Geologists witness the long-term record of many storms when they study
   deposits at the surface of the Earth; as a result they are especially
   well-suited to examine the history of El Niño events and make
   predictions for consequences of future El Niño events. Excessive
   rainfall and snowfall can trigger floods and mass-sliding of earth,
   rock, and mud. Geologists can predict about how much rain or snowmelt
   are needed before destructive floods and landslides occur, so they can
   make maps that depict locations and the likelihood of various hazardous
   conditions that might result from El Niño storms.
