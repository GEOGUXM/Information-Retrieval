   Cable Services Bureau

   The Cable Services Bureau was established in 1993 to implement and
   enforce the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of
   1992. The Bureau's mission expanded as a result of the
   Telecommunications Act of 1996. Now, in addition to regulating
   multichannel video programming distribution, the Bureau acts to promote
   competition in the converging communications marketplace and plays a
   significant role in monitoring and evaluating the deployment of
   broadband technologies.
