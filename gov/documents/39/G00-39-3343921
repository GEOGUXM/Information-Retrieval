   [2why6.gif] Why Study Ice Cores
   [contrt.gif]
   [worldcrv.gif] Climatology, the study of how the Earth's climate system
   works, operates under a distinct handicap in comparison to other
   phenomenological sciences. Other fields of study permit the formation
   of hypotheses and subsequent testing of these hypotheses by direct
   experimentation in the laboratory. This is not feasible in climatology,
   for we live in the only laboratory possible. It is called the Earth.

   Because we would be ill-advised to experiment on our only laboratory,
   we are left to construct computer models of how we believe the climate
   system of our planet works. If we understand the climate system
   correctly and have constructed our model appropriately, then the
   behavior of our model climate system should mimic the behavior of the
   Earth's climate system. One of the best ways to test our model is to
   see if it can reproduce the changes in climate which have happened
   throughout the long history of the Earth. Thus, acquiring detailed
   climate records extending back many hundreds of thousands of years has
   become a research priority in the study of global change.

   The study of ice cores is an indispensible part of this process. Over
   the past decade, research on the climate record frozen in ice cores
   from the polar regions has changed our basic understanding of how the
   climate system works. Changes in temperature and precipitation which
   previously we believed would require many thousands of years to happen
   were revealed, through the study of ice cores, to have happened in
   fewer than twenty years. These discoveries have challenged our beliefs
   about how the climate system works. We have been required to search for
   new, faster mechanisms for climate change and we have begun to consider
   the interaction between industrial man and climate in light of these
   newly revealed mechanisms.
