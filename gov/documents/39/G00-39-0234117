President's Announcement

   In October 1998, the President declared HIV/AIDS to be a severe and
   on-going health crisis in racial and ethnic minority communities . In
   response, the Administration, the Department of Health and Human
   Services (HHS), the Congressional Black Caucus, and the Congressional
   Hispanic Caucus announced a special package of initiatives aimed at
   reducing the impact of HIV/AIDS on racial and ethnic minorities.

   The Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative is part of HHS' larger Initiative to
   Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health by the year 2010.
   HIV/AIDS is one of that initiative's six focus areas.

Initiative Background

   The Initiative began in FY 1999 with $156 million, which increased to
   $251 million in FY 2000, and $350 million in FY 2001.

   The Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative provides funds to community-based
   organizations, faith communities, research institutions,
   minority-serving colleges and universities, health care organizations,
   state and local health departments, and correctional institutions to
   help them address the HIV/AIDS epidemic within the minority populations
   they serve.

HHS Partners

   HHS is working through six Federal agencies to provide grants for
   programs over the next three years dealing with HIV/AIDS prevention and
   education, research, faith-based initiatives, prison programs,
   expansion of treatment capacity, bilingual/bicultural services, Healthy
   Start, and other special projects.

   The agencies are:
     * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
     * Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
     * National Institutes of Health
     * Health Resources and Services Administration
     * Office of Minority Health
     * Indian Health Service
