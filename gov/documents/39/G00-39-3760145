     Information technology is a dynamic technology that has sparked the
   development of many new products and new services. All who work, go to
   school, maintain a household, or play can do their jobs better and can
                        benefit from this technology.
   ITL works with industry, research, and government organizations to make
      this technology more usable, more secure, more scalable, and more
    interoperable than it is today. We develop the tests and test methods
      that both the developers and the users of the technology need to
           objectively measure, compare and improve their systems.

      We also provide information services to NIST scientists and help
   federal agencies in understanding and arranging for computer security.

      We encourage you to explore these Web pages to find out about our
    activities. If you find areas that would be useful in your business,
   please contact the project leader or division chief. We have many ways
