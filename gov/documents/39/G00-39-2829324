   Joint Public Works/Police Department Environmental Crimes Unit Arrests
   Trash Hauler for Felony Illegal Dumping
   (Washington, DC) Investigators Anita Chavis (DPW) and Paul Kurgan (MPD)
   of DC's cross-agency Environmental Crimes Unit (ECU) have arrested the
   owner of a trash hauling company found to be dumping tons of solid
   waste in Southeast Washington. Terrance Calhoun, the owner of
   Metropolitan Waste Incorporated, confessed to Felony Illegal Dumping
   during questioning by Chavis and Kurgan.
   Responding to a complaint from residents, the ECU investigators
   proceeded to a vacant property at 4927 C St., SE. There, they sifted
   through huge mounds of construction debris before finding evidence
   leading to 601 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, a property belonging to Saul
   Centers, Inc. of Chevy Chase. Papers, room numbers and phone jacks
   found in the rubble narrowed the target area to the 8th floor, which
   was undergoing renovation. The space had previously been leased to the
   US Department of Justice, which is moving out of the building.
   Further investigation and interviews with the project's primary
   contractor, America's Contractor Services of Silver Spring, MD,
   identified Metropolitan Waste Inc. as one of the subcontractors hired
   to remove renovation debris from the job site. During routine
   questioning, Mr. Calhoun admitted to dumping the contents of a 30-yard
   roll-off container with a hauling capacity of over three tons.
   Calhoun faces prison time, a fine of up to $25,000, and confiscation of
   the commercial vehicle allegedly used in the dumping. His company,
   located at 1736 C St., SE, will also be charged with operating without
   a current license. Metropolitan Waste Inc.'s license expired in
   February. America's Contractor Services will also be fined up to $5000
   for hiring an unlicensed hauler. Leslie Hotaling, Director of DPW said,
   "We are very proud of the role we play in catching these offenders. We
   want to send a clear message that DC is nobody's dumping ground."
