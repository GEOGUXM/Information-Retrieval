                              Coastal Habitats

                           habitat habitat habitat

   Habitats are defined ecologically as environments where plants,
   animals, and other organisms live. For the NOAA Coastal Services
   Center, coastal habitats include the coastal wetlands, sea bottoms, and
   water columns of estuarine, coastal, and ocean waters, as well as the
   uplands that affect these areas. Center projects in this theme area
   develop information and tools that help coastal managers integrate the
   physical, ecological, economic, and social components of habitat
   protection and management.
     * GOAL 1
       The coastal management community has the information and tools to
       integrate physical, ecological, economic, and social components
       into habitat protection and management.
     * GOAL 2
       The coastal management community has the training, networks, and
       partnerships that facilitate informed decisions about habitats.
