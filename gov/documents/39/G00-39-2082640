                                  Magnetic Clouds

      Magnetic Clouds are produced in the solar wind when solar eruptions
      (flares and coronal mass ejections) carry material off of the Sun along
      with embedded magnetic fields. These magnetic clouds can be detected in
      the solar wind through observations of the solar wind characteristics -
      wind speed, density, and magnetic field strength and direction.

                          Corotating Interactive Regions

      Corotating Interactive Regions (CIRs) are regions within the solar wind
      where streams of material moving at different speeds collide and
      interact with each other. The speed of the solar wind varies from less
      than 300 km/s (about half a million miles per hour) to over 800 km/s
      depending upon the conditions in the corona where the solar wind has
      its source. Low speed winds come from the regions above helmet
      streamers while high speed winds come from coronal holes. As the Sun
      rotates these various streams rotate as well (co-rotation) and produce
      a pattern in the solar wind much like that of a rotating lawn
      sprinkler. However, if a slow moving stream is followed by a fast
      moving stream the faster moving material will catch-up to the slower
      material and plow into it. This interaction produces shock waves that
      can accelerate particles to very high speeds.

                              Composition Variations

      The chemical composition of the solar wind has several interesting
      aspects that hint at physical processes occuring in the solar wind
      source regions. The solar wind composition is different from the
      composition of the solar surface and shows variations that are
      associated with solar activity and solar features.
