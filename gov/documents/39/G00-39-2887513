                     WHAT TO DO WHEN A BENEFICIARY DIES:


   A family member or other person responsible for the beneficiary's
   affairs should do the following:

   O Promptly notify Social Security of the beneficiary's death by calling
   SSA toll-free at 1-800-772-1213.

   O If monthly benefits were being paid via direct deposit, notify the
   bank or other financial institution of the beneficiary's death. Request
   that any funds received for the month of death and later be returned to
   Social Security as soon as possible.

   O If benefits were being paid by check, DO NOT CASH any checks received
   for the month in which the beneficiary died or thereafter. Return the
   checks to Social Security as soon as possible.

   One-time Lump Sum Death Benefit:

   A one-time payment of $255 is payable to the surviving spouse if he or
   she was living with the beneficiary at the time of death, OR if living
   apart, was eligible for Social Security benefits on the beneficiary's
   earnings record for the month of death.

   If there is no surviving spouse, the payment is made to a child who was
   eligible for benefits on the beneficiary's earnings record in the month
   of death.

   Benefits for Survivors

   Monthly survivors benefits can be paid to certain family members,
   including the beneficiary's widow or widower, dependent children and
   dependent parents. The following booklets contain more information
   about filing for benefits and can be downloaded by clicking on the
