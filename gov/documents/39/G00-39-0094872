                              Learn About GLOBE

                         What is The GLOBE Program?

   GLOBE is a worldwide hands-on, primary and secondary school-based
   science and education program.

   For Students, GLOBE provides the opportunity to learn by:
     * Taking scientifically valid measurements in the fields of
       atmosphere, hydrology, soils, and land cover/phenology - depending
       upon their local curricula
     * Reporting their data through the Internet to the student data
       archive
     * Creating maps and graphs on the free interactive Web site to
       analyze data sets
     * Collaborating with scientists and other GLOBE students around the
       world

   For Teachers, GLOBE provides assistance through:
     * Training at professional development workshops
     * Teacher's guides, "how-to" videos, and other materials
     * Continuing support from a Help Desk, scientists, and partners
     * Contact with other teachers, students, and scientists worldwide in
       Web Chats and list serves

   For International and U.S. Partners, GLOBE provides:
     * Train-the-Trainer workshops
     * Guidance and support for mentoring teachers

                         What is the Value of GLOBE?

   "GLOBE is the quintessentially ideal program for involving kids in
   science," - Nobel laureate Dr. Leon Lederman.

   GLOBE trains teachers to help students improve their achievement in
   science and math, and in the use of computer and network technology.

   GLOBE helps teachers and students achieve state and local education
   goals and standards.

   GLOBE increases student awareness of their environment from a
   scientific viewpoint, without advocacy relative to issues.

   GLOBE improves student understanding of science because it involves
   them in performing real science - taking measurements, analyzing data,
   and participating in research in collaboration with scientists.

   GLOBE students contribute data for scientists to use in their research.

   GLOBE helps expand the pipeline of potential future scientists and
   researchers for industry, academia, and government.

                          Who is involved in GLOBE?

   GLOBE is a cooperative effort of schools, led in the United States by a
   Federal interagency program sponsored by NOAA, NASA, NSF, and EPA, in
   partnership with over 140 colleges and universities, state and local
   school systems, and non-government organizations. Internationally,
   GLOBE is a partnership between the United States and 95 other
   countries.

   Over a million primary and secondary students in more than 10,000
   schools have taken part in the program; there are more than 16,000
   GLOBE-trained teachers and those numbers are growing!

   Parents and others can work with teachers to help students obtain data
   on days when schools are not open.

                              How to Join GLOBE

   Teachers and other educators who wish to lead students in GLOBE need to
   attend special workshops in order to fully participate in the program.
   Internationally, contact your Country Point of Contact. In the U.S.
   look up currently scheduled workshops here and if you do not find a
   workshop you can attend, contact a Partner in your state or area. If
   you have any problems in the U.S., contact the Help Desk.
