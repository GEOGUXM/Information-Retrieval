    The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is an agency of the National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce.

   The mission of the NMFS is stewardship of the Nation's living marine
   resources. Through conservation and wise use, these resources and their
   habitat can be managed to benefit the Nation without jeopardizing
   options for the future.

   The National Marine Fisheries Service administers its research and
   management responsibilities through its headquarters in Silver Spring,
   Maryland and at regional and science centers located in five regions
   throughout the United States.

   The NMFS carries out its charge under many laws and mandates from
   Congress. Most of its responsibilities emanate from the following
   statutes: the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976,
   which regulates fisheries within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone
   (EEZ); the Endangered Species Act, which protects species determined to
   be threatened or endangered; the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which
   regulates taking or importing marine mammals; the Lacey Act, which
   prohibits fishery transactions that violate state, federal, American
   Indian or foreign laws; the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, which
   authorizes NMFS to collect fisheries data and to advise other
   government agencies on environmental decisions which affect living
   marine resources; and the Agricultural Marketing Act, which authorizes
   a voluntary seafood inspection program. There are more than 100 other
   statutes and international conventions and treaties that authorize
   NMFS' mission.
