   Computational chemistry may also be used as "experimental" tool to
   obtain information from nature ( The Philosophy of Computational
   Quantum Chemistry ). It is important to focus on the interplay between
   theoretical experimentation and physical experimentation. In the
   process of solving biochemical/biophysical problems using a
   computational approach, we should interact with experimental
   information as much as possible.
