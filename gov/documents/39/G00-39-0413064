   Background | Process | Highlights | Future Activities

   Background

   The CaliforniaBaja California Border Strategic Environmental Plan is
   the result of the continued commitment of the California Environmental
   Protection Agency and the Baja California Direccion General de Ecologia
   (Department of Ecology) with the support of Governors Davis, and
   Gonzalez Alcocer to address border environmental issues.

   Furthermore, the state representatives at the U.S.-Mexico Ten State
   Retreat in Austin Texas in November 1996 agreed to the development of
   state-to-state strategic plans as being one of the methods of
   coordinating and collaborating on environmental quality and protection.
   This plan is intended to provide a framework for participation and
   cooperation for the various state environmental agencies of California
   and Baja California.

   The California Environmental Protection Agency and the Baja California
   Direccion de Ecologia will be the primary points of contact for their
   respective states. The liaisons assigned by these agencies will oversee
   the development of this plan, and will arrange for ongoing meetings and
   dialogue to develop action plans, and will establish a schedule of
   activities, priorities and time frames.

   Process

   The California Border Environmental Coordinators Work Group under the
   direction of the Border Affairs Unit of the California Environmental
   Protection Agency is developing a strategic plan for the
   California-Baja California Border Environmental Program. The Work Group
   includes representatives from Cal/EPAs boards, departments and offices,
   the Resource Agency, the Office of Emergency Services and the Attorney
   Generals Office.

   The Work Group has been developing the strategic plan over the past
   three months. It is anticipated that the draft will be made available
   by late August for public review.

   Highlights

   The major components of the plan include the following:

   Mission Statement: The mission of the California-Baja California
   Environmental Program is to work towards a better environment within
   our shared border by identifying and resolving unique environmental and
   natural resource challenges and the resulting public health issues.
   This mission will be achieved through the use of science and
   technology, uniform enforcement of environmental laws and regulations,
   and the cooperation and active participation of the various California
   Border Tribal Communities and Governments, academia, industry,
   non-governmental organizations and the public.

   Vision Statement: A standard of excellence for international
   cooperation and collaboration that focuses on resolving environmental
   and natural resource issues to help ensure the future quality of a
   cleaner, safer, healthier and more prosperous border.

   Core Values: The following principles and philosophy guide the working
   relationship between California and Baja California, and the California
   Border Indian Tribal Communities and Governments:

       Protection and Development. Both states are committed to
     protecting the environment, restoring and conserving natural
     resources, and enhancing the economic vitality of the border region.
       Cooperation and Collaboration. Both states are committed to a
     partnership that will work toward a common vision; establish open
     communication and share knowledge and information, science and
     technology, and staff resources. This partnership will be the basis
     for notification of transboundary issues.
       Integrity and Respect. Both states are committed to truth,
     accuracy, and fairness, and are respectful of language, cultural and
     economic differences.
       Continuous Improvement. Both States are committed to continuously
     improve and update their efforts to maintain a clean border
     environment, and to incorporate technological innovations and
     enhancements to the programs dedicated to the protection of the
     environment.
       Leadership and Accountability. Both states are committed to being
     responsible leaders in environmental protection, and in addressing
     border issues and will work to establish examples that other Border
     States can follow.
       Public Participation and Communication. Both states are committed
     to engaging their border communities and to rely on the
     participation of their representatives to serve the interests of the
     border region and to work together to enhance the technical
     capabilities and professional development of their staff, and to
     recognize the efforts of the community.

   Goals: The goals of this Strategic Environmental Plan are to:

       Protect the environment.
       Restore and conserve natural resources.
       Achieve and maintain a high standard of public health.
       Increase sharing and use of science and technology.
       Ensure uniform enforcement of environmental laws and regulations.

   Future Activities

   Following managements review of the plan, final decisions will be made
   regarding the proposed objectives. Moreover, Boards, Departments and
   Offices under Cal/EPA will be required to develop specific Action Plans
   to implement the proposed objectives.

   Because this plan is intended to address short term, mid term and
   long-term goals, and thus is subject to change, it should be viewed as
   a living document. It serves as a starting point and will be reviewed
   on an annual basis to reflect changes in environmental issues and
   priorities, developing technologies, and changing organizational,
   political and budget focus.
