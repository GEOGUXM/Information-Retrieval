                       Internet/Intranet Web Services

   Welcome to the ARC Internet/Intranet Web Services Page.  This page is
   intended to provide an overview of the Web support services we offer to
   Federal Customers.  As you will see from the extensive range of
   services offered, we have the expertise to assist customers in all
   aspects of Web site design, development and maintenance.  If you would
   like further information, please feel free to contact us via e-mail at
   the address at the bottom of this page.

   Description of services we offer

   We can help you build a website from start to finish.  Specifically, we
   can:
     * Design a look and feel for your site, based on your business needs,
       desired style, content, etc.
     * Set up a navigation scheme for your site.  This navigation scheme
       is the road map for your site that customers can use to find the
       information they need.  Navigational schemes can be based on not
       only the information/services you want to provide, but also on your
       customer interests and use patterns.  That is, we can collect data
       about what information your customers are commonly looking for,
       what areas they visit regularly, etc. and design your site with a
       navigational scheme to make it even easier for your customers to
       use.
     * Design a template to make sure all your pages are consistent and
       accurate.  In addition, our templates are designed to help your
       site show up in search engines, such as Yahoo! and Alta Vista.
     * Establish standards to make sure your site is useable by the
       largest audience possible.  Such as, standards that support
       multiple browsers (i.e. Netscape and Internet Explorer) and simple
       standards that must be followed to make sure your pages are
       accessible to the physically challenged.  We are very familiar with
       these standards and other government mandated standards.  We can
       help you make sure you are reaching the broadest possible audience
       right from the start.
     * Develop procedures to make it simple to get information posted on
       your site.  Having good workflow procedures is very important
       regardless of the size of your site.  Such procedures are necessary
       regardless of whether you have a few people at a single location
       posting information to your site or many people all over the
       country.  We have experience with developing procedures for these
       different environments.
     * Develop and supply automated tools to help make your site easier to
       maintain.  For example, if you wanted to have a list of recently
       posted information on your website, you could do this manually or
       use a tool that recognizes new files and creates a "What's New"
       list automatically.  This tool keeps the What's New file up-to-date
       with minimal manual intervention.
     * Host your website on our servers, provide hands-on support on your
       own web server, or provide consultant type services to guide you
       through setting up your server.  While you have several options to
       choose from when it comes to where your site actually resides, we
       can help you regardless of where the web server is located.
     * Build custom applications based on your individual needs.

   Expertise of our staff

   Our staff of nine has a diverse range of expertise.  Our webmasters
   manage sites ranging in size from 2000 plus pages to other sites with
   20 pages.  Our programmers write applications in all the old and new
   "web languages."  We also have graphics software expertise, experience
   in analyzing web reports and developing navigational schemes.  We even
   have an expert in ensuring web pages are accessible for the physically
   challenged.

   We also have experience working with diverse organizations in various
   locations, with varied needs and goals, to create a single
   comprehensive site.  We have considerable experience in establishing
   the infrastructure to support such an environment efficiently and
   effectively.

   Our experience supporting Intranet/Internet sites

   We currently manage the Bureau of Public Debt's Internet site, which
   consists of over 2000 pages and numerous online applications, such as:

   The Daily History of the Public Debt

   Treasury Bill, Note, and Bond Auction History

   SLGS and Other Special Investments

   This site is centrally managed by our office and we work with numerous
   organizations in the Bureau that provide us with pages for the
   website.  We have received numerous awards for this site, including
   Best Fed Website by CIO magazine.  Our site is handicap accessible and
   in compliance with Federal regulations.

   We also manage Public Debt's Intranet site and the site you are
   currently visiting.  All of these require different standards and
   procedures, but meet the varied customer needs and management goals.
   We believe we support each effectively and efficiently and can do the
   same for you.

   We are anxious to help you with your website development or
   enhancement.  If you would like further information, call us at (304)
