   Map provided by GLOBE Visualizations (NASA GSFC) based on data from the
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA-14 satellite.

   Single image texture
          In the following models, a single map image is wrapped around a
          sphere representing the Earth. These are faster to load, but are
          more blurry when seen up close than the tiled versions below.
          Low resolution - loads 48kB of image data.
          Medium resolution - loads 124kB of image data.
          High resolution - loads 320kB of image data. Be patient while
          the texture is drawn.

   Tiled image textures
          In the following models, the earth is built up from 128 tiles
          each 22.5 degrees on a side. They are slower to load than the
          single-image versions above, and some browsers show seams
          between the tiles, but they are much sharper when seen up close.
          Low resolution - loads 63kB of image data.
          Medium resolution - loads 142kB of image data.
          High resolution - loads 331kB of image data.
