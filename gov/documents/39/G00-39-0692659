Provisional Data Disclaimer

   Data from realtime streamflow gages are relayed to the West Virginia
   District's office through the Geostationary Operational Environmental
   Satellite (GOES) data-collection system. Data are transmitted from each
   station at intervals of 4 hours and are loaded into the West Virginia
   District's National Water Information System (NWIS).

   Realtime data available on the West Virginia District's Home Page are
   provisional data that have not been reviewed or edited. These data may
   be subject to significant change and are not citeable until reviewed
   and approved by the U.S. Geological Survey. Realtime data may be
   changed after review because the stage-discharge relationship may have
   been affected by:
     * backwater from ice or debris such as log jams
     * algal and aquatic growth in the stream
     * sediment movement
     * malfunction of recording equipment


   Data are reviewed periodically to ensure accuracy. Each station record
   is considered provisional until the data are published. The data are
   usually published within 6 months of the end of the water year (Sept
   30).

   Data users are cautioned to consider carefully the provisional nature
   of the information before using it for decisions that concern personal
   or public safety or the conduct of business that involves substantial
   monetary or operational consequences.
