                              Camp Lejeune, NC

   ATSDR researchers are looking for 750 additional women who were
   pregnant while living in base housing on the Marine Corps base Camp
   Lejeune during 1968-1985. A survey is being done to determine the
   frequency of birth defects and childhood cancers among children that
   were carried during this time period and who might have been exposed to
   chemicals while in the womb. More than 12,450 women have been surveyed
   so far. ATSDR hopes to release the survey's findings by late summer.

   Some drinking water wells in operation at Camp Lejeune prior to 1985
   were found to be contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE) and
   tetrachloroethylene (PCE), chemicals used as degreasers and dry
   cleaning solvents. Information from the survey will be used to
   determine whether further evaluation is needed.

   If you believe you are eligible to participate in the survey, please
   call the National Opinion Research Center, toll free, at 1(800)
   639-4270. If the phones are busy, or if it is more convenient, you may
