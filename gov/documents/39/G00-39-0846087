   To date, the U.S. Postal Service has been unable to establish a time
   frame for regular mail delivery to the Environmental Protection Agency,
   1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC, 20460.

   The Brentwood Post Office, through which all incoming mail addressed to
   government agencies is processed, remains closed for normal mail
   delivery.

   All mail sent to EPA is being sent to Lima, Ohio, to be sterilized.
   This process, something never done before on this scale, is greatly
   contributing to the mail delay. At this time, the Agency is receiving
   approximately 50% - 75% of its normal flow of mail.

   If you must ensure that correspondence reaches EPA Headquarters by a
   certain date, please:
     * Use a private delivery service such as FedEx, UPS, etc.
     * Use electronic means such as fax or email.
     * Use a courier service.

   If you have further questions, you may contact James Anderson at
   anderson.james@epa.gov or Rich Lemley at lemley.rich@epa.gov.
