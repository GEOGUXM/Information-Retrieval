   U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

Freedom of Information Act

   The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. Section 552, is a
   statute that provides a process by which every person may request
   access to federal agency records or information. Federal agencies, such
   as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, are required to
   disclose records upon receiving a written request for them unless those
   records are protected from disclosure by any of the nine exemptions and
   three exclusions of the FOIA. The FOIA applies only to federal agencies
   and the records in its custody. The FOIA does not create an access to
   records held by Congress, the courts or by state and local governments.
   Any requests for state or local government records should be directed
   to the appropriate state or local government agency.

Privacy Act Overview

   The Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552a, passed by Congress in 1974,
   establishes certain controls over what personal information is
   collected by the federal government and how it is used. The act
   guarantees three primary rights: (1) the right to see records about
   oneself, subject to the Privacy Act's exemptions; (2) the right to
   amend that record if it is inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely or
   incomplete; and (3) the right to sue the government for violations of
   the statute, including permitting others to see your records, unless
   specifically permitted by the act.
