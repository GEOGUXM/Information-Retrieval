                  Community Development Quota (CDQ) Program
   The Western Alaska Community Development Quota (CDQ) Program allocates
       a percentage of all Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands quotas for
        groundfish, prohibited species, halibut, and crab to eligible
   communities. The purpose of the CDQ Program is to provide the means for
    starting or supporting commercial fisheries business activities that
   will result in an ongoing, regionally based, fisheries-related economy
                             in Western Alaska.
