      There's always something new to see at the New York State Museum.
     Through our Special Exhibits program, we open approximately 10 new
                             exhibits each year.
   Special Exhibits run for anywhere from one to several months and cover
    a wide range of topics - from insects to art. Some are developed from
   our own vast collections while others are brought in from other museums
                             across the country.

   Our main halls where long-standing favorites are on exhibit, year after
                                    year.
    These include the very popular Mohawk Iroquois Longhouse, the A-train
    and Sesame Street in Metropolis Hall, and the pre-historic wilderness
                   in Adirondack Hall, just to name a few.
