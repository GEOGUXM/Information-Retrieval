   Department of Commerce
     NIST works to assure that the U.S. realization of the basic and
   derived measurement units is consistent with the realization in other
   nations. NIST Laboratories engage in a number of international
   activities to support trade and global science, and to promote the
   international acceptance of U.S. measurement standards.

   International Agreements and Legal Metrology
     * CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement—National metrology institutes
       of the International Committee of Weights and Measures (CIPM) have
       signed this international arrangement calling for "mutual
       recognition of national measurement standards."
     * Other International Agreements—Under bilateral agreements with
       organizations in 18 nations, NIST is working to improve the quality
       of the international measurement system. These complement
       multilateral agreements, some involving more than 20 nations.
     * International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML)—NIST serves as
       the U.S. representative to this 97-country treaty organization.
       OIML recommends performance requirements for measuring instruments,
       which nations may incorporate into their laws or regulations.
     * Metric Program—This program helps to encourage the US transition to
       the metric system, the international standard for weights and
       measures.
