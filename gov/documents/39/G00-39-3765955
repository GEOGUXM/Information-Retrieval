   The ABC's Of Nuclear Science

   The ABC's of Nuclear Science is a brief introduction to Nuclear
   Science. We look at Antimatter, Beta rays, Cosmic connection and much
   more. Visit here and learn about radioactivity - alpha, beta and gamma
   decay. Find out the difference between fission and fusion. Learn about
   the structure of the atomic nucleus. Learn how elements on the earth
   were produced. Do you know that you are being bombarded constantly by
   nuclear radiation from the Cosmos? Discover if there are radioactive
   products found in a grocery store. Do you know if you have ever eaten
   radioactive food? Find out what materials are needed to shield us from
   alpha, beta, gamma, radiation. Discover what have we gained by its
   study.

                                          Guide to the Nuclear Wall Chart

   We have brought the TeacherÂ’s Guide to the Nuclear Science Wall Chart
   online. You can find out how we use the nucleus in every day life.
   Also, There is an extensive description on the effects of radiation in
   the environment. You can find answers for the following questions:
     * Do you want to know about the modern concept of the nucleus?
     * How nuclear physicists view the nucleus?
     * How could anyone measure something that small?
     * Do you know how we find new elements?
     * What are accelerators used for?

   You can find answers to these questions and learn about current
   research.

   High School teachers and students can find simple experiments that can
   be used in a Chemistry or Physics class. These experiments can be done
   in a classroom with inexpensive equipment.

   At this site, students and teachers at all levels can learn about the
   object that contains almost all of the mass in the Universe.
