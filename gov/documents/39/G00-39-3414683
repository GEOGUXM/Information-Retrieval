   Veterans that have specific service-connected disabilities may be
   entitled to a grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs for the
   purpose of constructing an adapted dwelling or modifying an existing to
   meet the veterans needs. The goal of the Specially Adapted Housing
   (SAH) Program is to provide a barrier-free living environment which
   affords the veterans a level of independent living he or she may not
   normally enjoy.
   Picture of Flag There are two types of grants administered by VA which
   are available to assist severely disabled veterans in adapting housing
   to their special needs.

     Part I, the Specially Adapted Housing Grant is available to disabled
     veterans who are entitled a wheelchair accessible home especially

     who are entitled to adaptations because of blindness in both eyes
