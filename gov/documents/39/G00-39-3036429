   Questions/Comments

   Fixed price sales are just like any retail sale. The asking price of an
   item is attached to it, you pay for the item and remove it. The fixed
   price sale is used to dispose of furniture, computer equipment,
   typewriters, calculators, electronic equipment, and other miscellaneous
   property.

   The Invitation to Purchase (ITP) may be viewed below by clicking on the
   Fixed Price Sale Number. The ITP contains item descriptions, sale terms
   and conditions, and item inspection times and location.

   Scheduled Sales: NO SALES SCHEDULED AT THIS TIME.



   NOTE:   SHUTTLE LAUNCH DATES MAY AFFECT INSPECTION AND SALE DATES. FOR
           CURRENT STATUS, CALL 321-867-7027.
