     JPL Stories On Thursday, January 31st from 4-5 p.m., Dr. Bruce
   Murray, Laboratory Director 1976-1982, will present "JPL and the
   Exploration of Mars." Click here for a copy of the flyer [pdfsmall.gif]
   . Come hear the firsthand accounts of a Mars explorer.

   The JPL Library, Archives, and Records Section sponsors the monthly
   series "JPL Stories" - the concept is to provide an informal and
   experiential environment for both the storyteller and the story
   listeners. The stories take place in the main customer service area of
   the Library, which is the ideal location for the warm and friendly
   atmosphere it offers. The plan is to keep the program as flexible as
   possible and include a cross section of storytellers from the JPL
   community. Stories can take place in the past, present or future; they
   can be historical or make believe; and they can be light-hearted or
   serious. They're an effective way to communicate and understand an
   organization's culture and can help employees develop a sense of
   organizational identity. Stories offer an approach different from the
   more formal lectures, seminars and town halls we have at JPL - they
   offer another way to be a part of the discussion. Several stories are
   in the planning stage - watch for "JPL Stories" flyers, posters and
   announcements. If you have questions or suggestions about the JPL Story
   series or if you wish to participate, please contact Teresa Bailey at
   ext. 4-9233 or teresa.r.bailey@jpl.nasa.gov.
