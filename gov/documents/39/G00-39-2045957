                History of On-Orbit Satellite Fragmentations

   Since 1961, more than 170 man-made objects in Earth orbit have
   undergone moderate to serious breakups. Another three dozen satellites
   have undergone less energetic debris-producing events. The debris from
   these fragmentations now account for nearly 40% of all cataloged
   satellites (typically larger than 10 cm in diameter) still in orbit.
   Only three of these fragmentations are known to have been caused by
   deliberate or accidental collisions. The vast majority of
   fragmentations appear to have arisen from explosions involving residual
   propellants or pressurants, battery malfunctions, self-destruction
   charges, or space defense activities.
   To understand better the source of these fragmentations for the purpose
   of limiting their future occurrence, The History of On-Orbit Satellite
   Fragmentations has been compiled and maintained since 1984. This 12^th
   edition is the latest in the series and updates the historical record
   to mid-2001. Each fragmented satellite is described along with its
   orbital characteristics and information about the fragmentation event,
   including the number of debris generated, the number remaining in
   orbit, and the assessed cause.
