      About Ginnie Mae

   Welcome to the Ginnie Mae Web Site

   Accessibility

   George S. Anderson So many individuals and families dream of having a
   house of their own, but many wonder how they could ever afford it. At
   Ginnie Mae our mission is to promote accessibility to affordable
   housing for all Americans. We have helped to finance homeownership
   opportunities for 24.5 million families. Our partnerships with people,
   non-profits, the investor community, and others help us in making
   homeownership opportunities available to more and more families.

   Our Web Site provides information to our customers and provides Ginnie
   Mae with opportunities to increase our mission in working with the
   mortgage industry to provide more affordable housing for the homebuyers
   of today and tomorrow. There is something for everyone here, including
   students. The Ginnie Mae Web Site also is accessible under the
   guidelines of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

   New Features

   In 1999, we added the Homezone, an educational section for children and
   teens. The Homezone is designed to teach young people about the
   benefits of homeownership, thrift, and saving - and to have some fun
   while learning. To improve accessibility to the Homezone, we now also
   have a Spanish version.

   GinnieNET 2020 is another example of our commitment to provide
   state-of-the-art technology for our business partners. GinnieNET 2020
   allows issuers and document custodians to submit electronically a
   variety of documents, reports, certifications, and other data in a
   timely and efficient manner, reducing their costs and improving
   processing efficiencies.

   We have completed a new section of the Ginnie Mae Web Site. "Your Path
   To Homeownership" is a vital resource for current and future
   homeowners. From finding a home to closing the loan, "Your Path To
   Homeownership" provides a wide range of essential information.

   The incorporation and utilization of technology, improvements in
   service to our clients, and other process and product improvements will
   remain a Ginnie Mae priority. We look forward to the challenges of the
   future with confidence, and we will continue to develop innovative
   solutions and products that will support our role in providing access
   to mortgage credit for America.
