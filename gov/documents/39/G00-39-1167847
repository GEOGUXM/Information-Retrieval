       The past months have been both a time of sadness and a time of
    strength, but we have emerged more unified as nation, and as a people
   than at any time in my lifetime. We are united by our sense of purpose
      and fueled by our determination. When we remain alert, aware, and
   informed, we take from the terrorists any chance to break our nation's
    spirits. Armed with knowledge and support, we can face the challenges
                            put before us. (more)
