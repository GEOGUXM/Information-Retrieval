                              Trade Statistics

                  [ "Pass-Through" ] [ "State of Origin" ]

   Trade Statistics are provided in two forms. "State of origin" and
   "Pass-through" export statistics. State of origin trade statistics
   refer to products that were produced within the State of Washington and
   subsequently exported. "Pass-through" trade statistics refer to
   products that pass through Washington State ports, both pass-through
   imports and pass through exports. The export figures include products
   that were produced in Washington State, as well as products that were
   produced in other states. On the import side, we estimate that only
   about 20 percent of all imports actually stayed in Washington. The
   other 80 percent were sent on to other states. We utilize this
   all-inclusive data because it demonstrates the overall importance of
   international trade to the state of Washington and, even though some
   imports and exports are merely transshipped in Washington State,
   transshipment has a significant economic impact on certain Washington
   State industries such as ports, railroads, trucking firms, stevedoring,
   etc.

   We would like to point out two minor problems with the export data
   enclosed. First, both "state of origin" and "pass through" export data
   does not include the value of the exports of services. We estimate that
   Washington State exports approximately $7 billion in export services
   each year. Of this total, we estimate that software exports surpass
   $3.5 billion annually. (The U.S. Census Bureau, the ultimate source for
   all trade data, considers software a service.) Second, pass-through
   export data seems indicate that we are shipping aircraft overland (i.e.
   by rail or truck) to places like Japan... which, of course is
   impossible ... the aircraft exports flew out under their own power.
   This is merely an anomaly in the way the raw data is organized by the
   Census Bureau and the computer program. We believe the value of
   aircraft exports is correct. We also believe that the destination of
   the aircraft exports is correct. It is only the mode of transportation
   (i.e. by land, rail or truck) that is incorrect.

   We have taken great care to make certain that the data is accurate,
   with the exceptions cited above. However, once in a while, someone will
   find something that doesn't look quite right. Please let us know if you
   observe something in the data, so we can either fix it or explain it.

   This data was prepared at state expense and is not copyrighted.
   However, if you do use it for a publication, etc., as a courtesy we
   would appreciate it if you would state that it was provided by the
   Washington State Department of Community, Trade and Economic
   Development.
