                 Office of Fleet Management

                 Mission
                 The mission of the Office of Fleet Management (OFM) is to support City
   departments and agencies in the delivery of municipal services by
   ensuring that City vehicles and other automotive-related equipment are
   available, dependable, and safe to operate.

   At the beginning of its tenure, the Rendell Administration recognized
   that 90 percent of all City services involved the use of vehicles. In
   April 1993, in response to recommendations by the Mayor's Private
   Sector Task Force, Mayor Rendell created OFM to centralize
   responsibility for the acquisition, assignment, and maintenance of
   approximately 6,000 City vehicles and pieces of equipment at the lowest
   long-term cost to Philadelphia taxpayers.

   This fleet includes ambulances, fire apparatus, trash compactors,
   highway paving equipment, police cars, riding mowers, passenger and
   cargo vans, jeeps, buses, and sedans, and generates an average of 1,617
   maintenance and repair work orders each week, or over 84,000 work
   orders a year.
