        As of December, 1998, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration has
        not granted approval to Hoechst Marion Roussel to release GVG
              to the U.S. market for use in treating epilepsy.

     However, Brookhaven and several other institutions have applied or
    are planning to apply for Investigative New Drug (IND) approval from
    the FDA to proceed with clinical trials of GVG for cocaine addiction.
                  Other trials are planned outside the U.S.

         Currently, Brookhaven is not accepting names of prospective
     volunteers for our trial, which will be small, carefully controlled
          and targeted to study GVG's toxicity in cocaine addicts.

      Please check this page in future months to learn of our progress.
    If additional information becomes available, we will post it here and
    on our toll-free information hotline, 1-888-BNL-RING (888-265-7464).

          In the meantime, if you or someone you know has a cocaine
             or other drug problem, and you want immediate help,
              please click here for phone numbers you can call.

   The U.S. Department of Energy owns Brookhaven National Laboratory and
   funds more than 80 percent of the multidisciplinary research performed
   there. DOE is a Cabinet-level agency that oversees a wide range of
   facilities, including the national laboratories.

   Addiction studies at BNL are funded largely by DOE's Office of Science
   through its Office of Biological and Environmental Research.
   Specifically, DOE supports the development and use of radiotracers for
   positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and the advanced use of
   medical imaging and other technologies to understand the processes of
   the human brain.

                 National Institute on Drug Abuse

   The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which supports more than
   85 percent of the world's research on drug abuse and addiction, is an
   institute of the National Institutes of Health. NIDA-supported science
   addresses the most fundamental and essential questions about drug
   abuse, ranging from the molecule to managed care, and from DNA to
   community-outreach research.

   NIDA has funded many addiction studies at BNL and its collaborating
   institutions. It also has founded a Regional Neuroimaging Center at
   BNL, the first outside of NIDA headquarters.

                 National Institute of Mental Health

   The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), one of the National
   Institutes of Health, is the foremost mental health research
   organization in the world, with a mission of improving the treatment,
   diagnosis, and prevention of mental disorders such as schizophrenia and
   depressive illnesses, and other conditions that affect millions of
   Americans.

   Beginning in the 1980s, NIMH funding has supported the efforts of the
   NYU and Brookhaven researchers to study the biochemical underpinnings
   of schizophrenia through functional (PET) imaging. These studies laid
   the foundation for studies of GVG's impact on cocaine's biochemical and
   behavioral effects. NIMH has also funded other functional imaging
   research at BNL, including studies of Alzheimer's disease.
