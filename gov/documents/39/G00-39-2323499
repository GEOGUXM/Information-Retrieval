                             Satellites and Data

    Welcome to an Introduction to Satellites and their Data. Here you can
    find out all about the satellites, their missions, the kinds of data
    they produced, and the exciting discoveries derived from those data.

                               The Satellites

   Probing the structure and evolution of our Universe and the objects its
     contains requires, in general, that we make our observations above
   Earth's absorbing atmosphere. Starting with sounding rocket flights in
      the late 1940s, scientists have been able to develop ever-better
    instruments to probe deeper into space and finer into the details of
    our cosmos. This section will allow you to learn about the satellites
   and missions which have provided scientists the foundation of "what we
                                   know".

              * Tell Me about Cosmic Ray Satellites & Missions

                                  The Data

        The information, or data, about our Universe measured by the
       instruments aboard satellites are transferred to the ground and
     analyzed by scientists. The data can arrive in many forms and much
    processing is usually required before it can be used to "do science".
    This section will discuss the data, the typical processing, the final
   data archive, the scientific analysis process, and the final scientific
                                  results.
