      The CDF Law Enforcement Program encompasses various activities
      regarding the protection of natural and man-made resources throughout
      the state. CDF peace and public officers are appointed under state
      Penal Code authority and are responsible for enforcing statutes and
      ordinances including but not limited to, state forest and fire laws,
      timber harvesting regulations, fire codes and investigating wildland
      and other fires within state jurisdictions. The Office of the State
      Fire Marshal (OSFM) responsibilities for fire and arson investigations
      are met through the Department's Arson Investigation Unit and
      Arson/Bomb Investigation Team.
      CDF State Fire Marshal Logo Determining fire causes, interviewing
      witnesses, issuing citations, and prosecuting cases, both civil and
      criminal, keep the department's 400 plus officers busy year round. CDF
      investigators have a 90 plus percent conviction rate for arson cases
      filed with the courts.
      Law enforcement staff participates in local arson task force committees
      and provide assistance to many federal, state, local fire and law
      enforcement agencies, when requested. This includes arson, bomb,
      fireworks, fire extinguisher, and other criminal investigations, as
      well as assisting with the disposal of explosives.
      Law Enforcement staff assists with training of state and local fire
      investigators and are involved with emergency fire and law enforcement
      assistance requested through the Governor's Office of Emergency
      Services.
      Internal activities include conducting background investigations for
      all prospective CDF/OSFM peace officers, internal affairs
      investigations, and addressing citizen complaints against employees.
      The Department's Arson Hotline is maintained by the Sacramento Law
      Enforcement Section, which also processes requests for payment of arson
      rewards. Rewards of up to $10,000 are available for information
      regarding wildland fires within State jurisdiction. Depending on the
      magnitude of the fire, enhanced rewards of up to $25,000 or higher may
      be available.
