   SPECIAL REVIEWS BRANCH

   The DFAS Special Reviews Branch is responsible for the resolution of
   audit findings reported by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG)
   in audits of NIHs contractors and grantees, including audits
   performed under the provisions of the Single Audit Act Amendments as
   issued in OMB Circular A-133.   The Branch also performs financial
   reviews and analyses of complex contract cost proposals and provides
   on-site technical assistance to the acquisition staff in each of
   NIHs Institutes and Centers to support them in analyzing less
   complex contract proposals. In addition, the Branch performs
   financial capability, accounting system and termination/delay claim
   reviews and provides technical assistance relative to contract
   close-outs and other special requests.
