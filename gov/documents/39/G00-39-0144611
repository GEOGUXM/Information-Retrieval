   Overview
   By Ted G. Sopher
   November 8th 2000
   LSG provides Local Area Network (LAN) infrastructure and network
   connection support services to LBNL staff and research programs lab
   wide. Since 1986, LBLnet has grown from 100 user attachments to over
   9000 supporting computer platforms and operating systems running on a
   wide variety of PC and workstation hardware. Thus, LSG is challenged
   with the task of supporting a Local Area Network in a highly
   heterogeneous environment presenting us with difficult issues of system
   network compatibility and inter-system interoperability which are often
   disguised as "Network Faults". This in itself is a significant
   undertaking without considering ongoing infrastructure development and
   maintenance performed over time.

   To date the LSG directly administers and provides support for services
   such as: Domain Name System (DNS), Boot Protocol Services (bootp),
   Network Time Protocol Service (NTP), Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP) and, Windows Internet Name Service (WINS).

   LSG is constantly working to improve the functionality of LBLnet by
   locating and eliminating traffic bottlenecks and minimizing network
   downtime. With seven high performance multiprotocol routers supporting
   83 three-protocol-subnets, almost total building coverage is achieved
   by the resultant 120 LAN segments emanating from them thus, LBLnet is a
   challenge to maintain and grow. Nevertheless, LSG, currently a
   technical and professional staff of ten, provides infrastructure
   support that includes router installations and upgrades, network media
   repair and upgrades, network characterization and analysis, testing and
   analysis of network equipment furnished by various equipment
   manufacturers through "alpha and beta" (see note 1) testing programs.
   We have developed and/or implemented a number of network services
   deployed to serve LBLnet users. Such systems include; a Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP) service Windows Internet Name Service
   (WINS) with automatic DNS registry. Additionally, we provided the
   design and systems implementation of the first Serial Line Internet
   Protocol (SLIP) and Point to Point Protocol (PPP) service and now
   provide Remote Access Services, such as ISDN and DSL support to LBNL
   staff. Further, we all provide VPN support in collaberation with the
   Laboratory's CPPM to provide secure LBLnet access from remote
   locations.
