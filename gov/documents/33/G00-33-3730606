Public Comment

   On December 4, 2000, Executive Order 13178 established the Northwestern
   Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve (Reserve). The Reserve
   encompasses marine waters and submerged lands of the Northwestern
   Hawaiian Islands extending approximately 1200 nautical miles long and
   100 nautical miles wide.

   As part of the creation of the Reserve, certain conservation measures
   that restrict activities throughout the Reserve and Reserve
   Preservation Areas around various islands and banks were created within
   the Reserve where consumptive or extractive uses are prohibited.

   During a 30-day comment period on the conservation measures and the
   proposal to make the Reserve Preservation Areas permanent, NOAA, on
   behalf of the Secretary of Commerce, received the public comments and
   held seven public hearings on behalf of the White House to accept
   written and oral comments.

   Approximately 8,400 public comments were received. Click below to
   download the summary document.

   On January 18, 2001, after considering the comments received, the
   process and establishment of the Reserve was finalized by issuance of
   Executive Order 13196. This Executive Order modified Executive Order
   13178 by revising certain conservation measures and making permanent
   the Reserve Preservation Areas with modifications. With this action,
   the establishment of the Reserve, including the conservation measures
   and permanent Reserve Preservation Areas, is complete.
