   Groundfish Observer Program

   The Fishery Resource Analysis and Monitoring Division provides the
   scientific basis for determination of ecologically-safe and
   economically-valuable harvest levels for west coast fisheries. This
   involves comprehensive analysis of data from fishery monitoring,
   fishery-independent resource surveys, and biological investigations.
   The results provide estimates of the current status and future trends
   in abundance and productivity of marine fishery resources, evaluations
   of the potential effects of fishery management alternatives on
   abundance and yield of living marine resources, and better information
   on fishery bycatch and other multi-species issues.
   More information about specific Fishery Resource Analysis and
   Monitoring research programs can be found in the Issue Papers.
