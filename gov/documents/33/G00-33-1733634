      The Clinical Center Volunteer Services Program offers a range of
      volunteer opportunities--from helping patients to assisting in the
      laboratory. The daytime positions are available for dependable
      individuals who handle a variety of duties. The volunteer program has
      several components: adult volunteers, student volunteers, volunteer
      interpreters, and the Family Friend Program.

      Volunteer opportunities are available to adults interested in assisting
      health-care specialists one or more days a week for a six-month to
      one-year commitment. Opportunities are also open to persons able to
      provide a concentrated block of time over a shorter period of
      commitment. Volunteer positions for retirees may be available, so
      inquire about our flexible volunteer schedules.

      Qualified students who are enrolled in high school or college may also
      volunteer. Students who are interested in developing health- science
      skills during the school year or summer vacation can earn credit
      towards their degree while volunteering at the Clinical Center. The
      "Buddy Program" offers opportunities for students 16-18 years of age to
      assist young adults with their adjustment while a patient in the
      Clinical Center.

      The Volunteer Language Interpreter Program assists patients who don't
      speak English. Spanish interpreters volunteer daily. Other language
      specialists are called as needed. The Volunteer Program encourages
      anyone with language skills to apply to be a language interpreter.
      Training is provided.

      The Family Friend Program welcomes volunteer participants to help young
      patients enjoy play time while offering parents a respite from their
      often-demanding hospital routine. This program accepts a limited number
      of volunteers.

      Training and Supervision

        Volunteers receive an orientation when accepted for a volunteer
        position. In addition, each department or section where the
        volunteer is placed is responsible for the hands-on training.
        Training may be provided in laboratory techniques and occupational
        safety precautions. Volunteers are required to obtain a health
        screening, which includes a tuberculosis test.

      Volunteer Responsibilities

        The volunteer has the responsibility to be dependable, prompt,
        efficient, and pleasant and is held to these same standards as a
        paid worker. To be an effective volunteer requires a sincere
        interest in the work, acceptance of supervision, adherence to
        hospital policies, and a respect for confidentiality. Volunteers are
        expected to make a firm commitment on specific services for a
        specific number of hours and times. Volunteering can be a learning
        experience as well as a source of fulfillment and joy.
