                       ABOUT DARP IN NORTHWEST REGION

   The mission of the Damage Assessment and Restoration Program (DARP) is
   to restore coastal and ocean resources that have been injured by
   releases of oil or hazardous substances and to obtain compensation for
   the public for their losses. DARP's Northwest Regional office is
   responsible for ongoing natural resource damage assessments and
   restoration in the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Alaska. The
   office also provides assistance to the Southwest Regional office as
   needed.

   The Program consists of an interdisciplinary team dedicated exclusively
   to conducting damage assessments and restoring marine resources. This
   unique approach to natural resource damage assessment was shaped over a
   decade of assessing injuries to coastal and marine resources that
   reached a peak following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in March 1989. As
   principal federal trustee for natural resources in the coastal and
   marine environment, NOAA evaluates injuries caused by the release of
   hazardous substances or discharge of oil. NOAA and other federal, state
   and/or Indian tribe co-trustees act on behalf of the public to
   determine whether and how to restore the natural resources and natural
   resource services injured as a result of these releases or discharges.
   The trustees then seek to recover property and/or in-kind services
   needed to implement restoration plans from parties responsible for the
   injuries. They also seek, where appropriate, to compensate the public
   for other losses arising from the injuries. The process of measuring
   and evaluating natural resource injuries, planning restoration and
   valuing public losses is referred to as natural resource damage
   assessment (NRDA). Additional background information can be found on
   the Damage Assessment and Restoration Program web site.

   The Rapid Assessment Program (RAP) is co-located in the Northwest
   office. It was established in January of 1992, and is an on-call team
   of NOAA scientists and contractors responsible for evaluating spills of
   oil and hazardous substances. The goal of the RAP is to collect
   perishable data and information, photographs and videotape of a spill
   in a timely manner in order to determine the need for natural resource
   damage assessment. For more information about the Rapid Assessment
   Program, see the Damage Assessment and Restoration Program home page.
