   The Map Maker pages allow you to construct a map from a set of layers
   that may be turned off or on. Zoom and pan controls are provided for
   the user to focus on an area of interest.  A list of layers and display
   scales can be found HERE.  Zooming in will increase the number of map
   layers available on all map makers.  Many are initially deactivated in
   order to reduce the transmission time required to draw the map on your
   computer.
