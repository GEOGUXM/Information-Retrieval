   Agricultural Research and H5N1, "Hong Kong Bird Flu"
   H5N1, the strain of avian flu that has infected people in Hong Kong, is
   not known to occur in the United States. But to help protect people and
   poultry in the United States, studies relating to H5N1 have been under
   way in a secure quarantine laboratory of USDA's Agricultural Research
   Service in Athens, Ga. This fact sheet outlines those studies and
   provides other details about avian flu viruses and U.S. safeguards
   against them.

   The ARS studies are led by veterinary pathologist David Swayne of ARS's
   Southeast Poultry Disease Research Laboratory in Athens. Some of the
   ARS studies assist the Centers for Disease Control in its mission of
   protecting human health. Other studies in Athens aim at determining
   whether vaccines can prevent U.S. poultry from contracting or spreading
   H5N1. This would relieve the virus' potential threat to the poultry
   industry and-- by reducing the chance of human exposure--to people. For
   details of the ARS studies, contact Swayne at telephone (705) 546-3433.

   For human health issues surrounding H5N1, contact Tom Skinner, Centers
   for Disease Control, Atlanta, Ga., telephone (404) 639-3286.

   and Plant Health Inspection Service in Riverdale, Md.

   What are ARS scientists doing about H5N1?

   [K8253-6.jpg] Transmission of H5N1 to poultry--ARS scientists, at the
   request of the CDC, conducted studies that determined that strains of
   H5N1 isolated from people in Hong Kong could be transmitted to poultry.
   ARS confirmed H5N1 virus isolated from humans was 100 percent lethal in
   poultry. They continue to help the CDC by providing insights on H5N1's
   molecular structure, which will help with identifying a related virus
   to use in vaccines. It would not be safe, or practical, to use the
   killed Hong Kong H5N1 virus itself as a vaccine. Also, ARS scientists
   will use their knowledge of genetics and microbiology to help CDC
   researchers understand why this virus moved from poultry to people.

   Previously, the CDC did not have a Biosafety Level 3 (BL-3) facility
   available to conduct H5N1 research, so they used an ARS facility in
   Athens until space in a CDC facility opened in December.

   These highly specialized research facilities are designed and operated
   to prevent release of viral agents into the environment. For example,
   air is filtered and water heat-treated and research staff have special
   training in bio-hazard control.

   Three new poultry vaccines for H5 avian flu virus--ARS scientists and
   colleagues at Merial Select, a veterinary pharmaceutical company at
   Gainesville, Ga., have already tested a vaccine that has proved
   effective against other H5-type viruses. The vaccine, vFP-89, was
   developed 10 years ago by Merial-Select. Merial received in February,
   1998 a license from the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
   Service to provide the vaccine in case of an emergency outbreak.

   Another vaccine is under development by ARS in cooperation with Maine
   Biological Laboratories, Inc., of Waterville, Me. This inactivated
   vaccine would target H5-type avian flu viruses--one of the most
   associated with virulent stains. It would be an important safeguard
   against any future highly virulent outbreaks. There is still another
   vaccine under development. ARS has been working with Protein Sciences
   of Meriden, Conn. on using an insect virus as a host system to produce
   specific H5 proteins to be used in subsequent vaccines. The three
   different vaccines have been tested in chickens in the high
   biocontainment laboratory and provide protection against the deadly
   H5N1 virus.

   Keeping H5N1 out of the United States

   The U.S. has a zero-tolerance policy on all kinds of highly pathogenic
   avian influenza. No cases of virulent H5N1 have been found in this
   country, according to APHIS surveys. APHIS has found no evidence of
   virulent stains in breeding chickens, which means chicks hatched in the
   U.S. are virus-free.

   Chickens and turkeys are also inspected by USDA's Food Safety and
   Inspection Service at slaughter for food safety. FSIS removes any
   chickens that are not fit for human consumption. For details, contact
   the Food Safety and Inspection Service at (202) 720- 9113.

   No poultry or raw meat comes to the U.S. from Hong Kong. In December
   1997, USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service prohibited
   exotic birds from entering U.S. quarantine stations from Hong Kong.

   H5 and H7 Viruses: We have effective controls in place :

   Highly virulent H5 outbreaks have occurred in the United States, most
   recently in 1983. No human transfer occurred. Infected and threatened
   poultry were quickly quarantined and destroyed.

   If another highly virulent outbreak occurs, it is expected that the
   developmental vaccines mentioned above will be ready to inoculate
   poultry in "buffer areas" outside the quarantine.

   Biochemical Makeup of H5N1

   The "H" and "N" in H5N1 refer to specific proteins that make up the
   virus. There are 15 sub-types of hemagglutinin (H) and nine sub-types
   of neuraminidase (N) viral proteins. Only two sub-types, H5 and H7, are
   associated with highly virulent strains. H5 or H7 proteins by
   themselves do not make an avian flu virus highly virulent. Virulence
   arises only after the hemagglutinin gene of the virus become capable of
   coding for "highly cleveable hemagglutinin" that enable the virus to
   replicate quickly.

   Most avian flu viruses multiply in a bird's lungs, respiratory tract
   and gut. Highly virulent strains multiply in brain, heart and other
   internal organs. Mutations may change a virus' preferred host. Until
   the arrival of H5N1, the usual path of such viruses has been from birds
   to swine to humans. Hong Kong H5N1 is the first avian flu strain
   believed to have moved from poultry directly to humans.
