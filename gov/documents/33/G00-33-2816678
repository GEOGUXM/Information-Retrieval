          General Description of the Department of Transportation's

                         Regulatory Responsibilities


   The Department of Transportation (DOT) consists of nine operating
   administrations, the Office of the Secretary, and the Bureau of
   Transportation Statistics, each of which has a statutory responsibility
   for a wide range of regulations. For example, DOT regulates safety in
   the aviation, motor carrier, railroad, mass transit, motor vehicle,
   maritime, commercial space, and pipeline transportation areas. DOT
   regulates aviation consumer and economic issues and provides financial
   assistance and issues the necessary implementing rules for programs
   involving highways, airports, mass transit, the maritime industry,
   railroads, and motor vehicle safety. It issues regulations carrying out
   such disparate statutes as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the
   Uniform Time Act. It regulates the construction and operation of
   bridges over navigable waters, the prevention of oil pollution, and the
   security of commercial aviation and passenger vessels. Finally, DOT has
   responsibility for developing policies that implement a wide range of
   regulations that govern internal programs such as acquisitions and
   grants, access for the disabled, environmental protection, energy
   conservation, information technology, property asset management,
   seismic safety, security, and the use of aircraft and vehicles. A list
   of all the areas for which DOT has regulatory responsibility is
   provided under the Departmental element responsible for initiating
   action in the next section.
