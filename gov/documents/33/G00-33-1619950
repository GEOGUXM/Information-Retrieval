   00/Apr00 * The FIRE web site has been developed to make information on
   FIRE and fusion science accessible and up to date. A steady stream of
   about 150 visitors per week log on to the FIRE web site since the site
   was initiated in early July, 1999. Burning Plasma Physics is Widely
   Accepted as the Primary Objective for a Next Step in Fusion Research *
   Grunder Panel and Madison Forum endorsed Burning Plasmas as next step.
   * NRC Interim Report identified "integrated physics of a self-heated
   plasma" as one of the critical unresolved fusion science issues. * The
   Snowmass Fusion Summer Study endorsed the burning plasma physics
   objective, and that the tokamak was technically ready for high-gain
   experiment. * R. Pellat, Chair of the CCE-FU has stated that "the
   demonstration of a sustained burning plasma is the next goal" for the
   European Fusion Program. * SEAB noted that "There is general agreement
   that the next large machine should, at least, be one that allows the
   scientific exploration of burning plasmas" and if Japan and Europe do
   not proceed with ITER "the U. S. should pursue a less ambitious machine
   that will allow the exploration of the relevant science at lower cost."
   "In any event the preliminary planning for such a machine should
   proceed now so as to allow the prompt pursuit of this option." Physics

   Achieved * Toroidal and poloidal coil structures are independent
   allowing operational flexibility * The toroidal field coils are wedged
   with static compression rings to increase capability to withstand
   overturning moments and to ease manufacturing. * 16 coil TF system with
   large bore provides * Large access ports (1.3m high by 0.7m wide) for
   maintenance and diagnostics. * Low TF ripple (0.3% at plasma edge)
   provides flexibility for lower current AT modes without large alpha
   losses due to ripple. * Double-null divertor configuration for H-mode
   and AT modes with helium pumping that is
   maintainable/replaceable/upgradeable remotely * Double wall vacuum
   vessel with integral shielding (ITER-like) to reduce neutron dose to TF
   and PF coils, and machine structure. * Cooling to LN2 allows full field
   (10T) flattop for 20s or 4T (TPX-like) flattop for 250s. The FIRE

   (1989-1999) have developed enhanced confinement modes that scale
   (e.g.,ITER-98H) 1.3 times higher than the 1989 CIT design assumption.
   Alcator C-Mod - the prototype for Compact High Field tokamaks has
   shown: * Confinement in excess of 1.4 times the 1989 design guidelines
   for CIT and ~1.15 times the recent ITER-98H design guidelines. *
   Successful ICRF heating at high density in shaped diverted plasmas *
   Successful detached divertor operation at high power density D-T
   experiments on TFTR and JET have shown: * Tritium can be handled safely
   in a laboratory fusion experiment!!! * D-T plasmas behaved roughly as
   predicted with slight improvements in confinement in plasmas with weak
   alpha-heating. Engineering Innovations to increase capability and

   TSC/Kessel/21-q.ps FIRE could Access High-Gain Advanced Tokamak Regimes
   for Long Durations * The coupling of advanced tokamak modes with
   strongly burning plasmas is a generic issue for all advanced "toroidal"
   systems. The VLT PAC, Snowmass Burning Plasma and Energy Subgroup B
   recommended that a burning plasma experiment should have AT capability.
   * FIRE, with strong plasma shaping, flexible double null poloidal
   divertor, low TF ripple, dual inside launch pellet injectors, and space
   reserved for the addition of current drive (LHCD) and/or a smart
   conducting wall, has the capabilities needed to investigate advanced
   tokamak regimes in a high gain burning plasma. * The LN inertially
   cooled TF coil has a pulse length capability ~250 s at 4T for DD
   plasmas. This long pulse - AT capability rivals that of any existing
   divertor tokamak or any under construction. The coils are not the
   limit. * Recent AT regimes on DIII-D (Shot 98977) sustained for ~ 16 !E
   serve as demonstration discharges for initial AT experiments on FIRE.

   Issues for FIRE and Magnetic Fusion The critical physics and
   engineering issues for FIRE are the same as those for fusion, the goal
   of FIRE is to help resolve these issues for magnetic fusion. The issues
   and questions listed below need to be addressed in the near future. *
   Physics - confinement - H-mode power threshold, edge pedestal, AT
   modes, - stability - NTMs, RWM, disruptions: conducting wall? feedback
   coils? VDE? - heating and current drive - ICRF is baseline: NBI & LHCD
   as upgrades? - boundary - detached divertor operation, impurity levels,
   confinement - self-heating - fast alpha physics and profile effects of
   alpha heating Development of self-consistent self-heated AT modes with
   external controls * Engineering - divertor and first wall power
   handling (normal operation and disruptions) - divertor, first wall and
   vacuum vessel for long pulse AT modes - evaluate low inventory tritium
   handling possibilities - complete many engineering details identified
   in FIRE Engineering Report - evaluate potential sites for Next Step MFE
   experiment - complete cost estimate for baseline, identify areas for
   cost reduction Major Conclusions of the FIRE Design Study *
   Exploration, understanding and optimization of alpha-dominated
   (high-gain) burning plasmas are critical issues for all approaches to
   fusion. * The tokamak is a cost-effective vehicle to investigate
   alpha-dominated fusion plasma physics and its coupling to advanced
   toroidal physics for MFE. The tokamak is technically ready for a next
   step to explore fusion plasma physics. * The FIRE compact high field
   tokamak can address the important alpha- dominated plasma issues, many
   of the long pulse advanced tokamak issues and begin the integration of
   alpha-dominated plasmas with advanced toroidal physics in a $1B class
   facility. * The FIRE design point has been chosen to be a "stepping
   stone" between the physics accessible with present experiments and the
   physics required for the ARIES vision of magnetic fusion energy. * A
   plan is being developed for an Advanced Tokamak Next Step that will
   address physics, engineering and cost issues in FY 2000-1 with the goal
   of being ready to begin a Conceptual Design in 2002.
