     Street Terms: Drugs and the Drug Trade

     criminal justice professionals who work with the public. The Street
     Terms database contains over 2,000 street terms that refer to
     specific drug types or drug activity.

     All terms are cross-referenced where possible. A single term or
     similar terms may refer to various drugs or have different meanings,
     reflecting geographic and demographic variations in slang. All known
     meanings and spellings are included. No attempt was made to
     determine which usage is most frequent or widespread. Different
     definitions for a single term are separated by semi-colons (;). The
     use of commas (,) and the connective "and" indicates that the term
     refers to the use of the specified drugs in combination.
