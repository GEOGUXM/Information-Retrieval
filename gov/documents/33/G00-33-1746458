   Water Data
     __________________________________________________________________

   NOTE: As of June 6th, 2001, our Florida water data (surface and ground
   water) is available on the NWIS-Web, a new comprehensive national
   database developed to combine historical and real-time data into one
   database. This new system allows the user to access several hundred
   million pieces of archival and real-time data and format it in the way
   they best can use the information. Until August, the original Florida
   real-time pages will remain available for your use. After August, the
   NWIS-Web will be our functioning surface- and ground-water database for
   both real-time and historical data.

   "Our users can now gain easy access to over 100 years of water
   information, all with the click of a mouse," said Robert Hirsch, USGS
   Associate Director for Water. "This not only saves them time, money,
   and effort for the user, but also allows our hydrologists and
   technicians to concentrate on collecting data and processing the
   information derived from it. NWISWeb is an integral part of the USGS
   mission to disseminate important water-quality and quantity data to the
   public.

  Surface Water Data

     * Surface Water Real-time Data - Water level data collected
       continuously from on-line stream-gaging sites in Florida. Real-time
       data are considered provisional data. This data is available for
       all 4 Subdistricts in Florida.
     * Historical Data(NWIS-W) - Water data which has been collected as
       part of the National Water Information System (NWIS). This data
       includes daily streamflow and peak flow records which have been
       reviewed and approved for public release. This data is currently
       available on the new NWIS-Web

  Ground Water Data

     * Real-time Data - Ground water level data collected continuously
       from on-line wells in Florida. Real-time data are considered
       provisional data. Ground water realtime data is available for the
       Miami and Tampa Subdistricts and minimally for the Orlando
       Subdistrict.
     * Historical Ground Water Conditions - These data records have been
       reviewed and approved for public release. For Miami, data include
       end-of-month ground water level readings from October 1996 to
       present. For Tampa, historical ground water data can be requested
       online. For Orlando and Tallahassee, historical ground water data
       can be obtained upon request:
       - Orlando: schiffer@usgs.gov, (407) 865-6725
       - Tallahassee: franklin@usgs.gov or lsloan@usgs.gov, (850) 942-9500

  Water Quality Data

   Water quality data is being collected and assimilated within National
   Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) studies in 2 regions of Florida:
     * Southern Florida
     * Georgia-Florida Coastal Plain

  Water Use Data

     * Florida Water Use - This data is collected and published every 5
       years by the Florida District. The most recent data (1995) is shown
       here. It includes the quantities of ground and surface water
       withdrawn for all major land uses in Florida.
     * Water Use in the United States - The U.S. Geological Survey's
       National Water-Use Information Program is responsible for compiling
       and disseminating the nation's water-use data. Every five years,
       data at the state and hydrologic region level are compiled into a
       national water-use data system and are published in a national
       circular.

  National Water Data

          Contains information on, and access to, water data collected by
          the USGS throughout the nation.
