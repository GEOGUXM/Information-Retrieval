   1. What is the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary?
   In 1972, Congress pass ed the Marine Protection, Research and
   Sanctuaries Act in response to a growing awareness of the intrinsic
   environmental and cultural value of our coastal waters. The Act
   authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to designate discrete areas as
   national marine sanctuaries to promote comprehensive management of
   their special ecological, historical, recreational. and esthetic
   resources.
   On January 31, 1975, the resting place of the Civil War ironclad USS
   Monitor was designated this nation's first mari ne sanctuary. The
   Monitor National Marine Sanctuary, and all areas subsequently
   designated marine sanctuaries, are part of the National Marine
   Sanctuary Program administered by the Sanctuaries and Reserves Division
   (SRD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
   The Monitor National Marine Sanctuary is located approximately 16 miles
   south-southeast of the Cape Hatteras lighthouse. The Sanctuary is an
   area one mile in diameter that reaches from the surface of the oce an
   to the sea bed. Water depth is 230 feet. Bottom conditions, including
   visibility, current, and temperature, are variable.
   2. Why is the Monitor important in American history?
   The Monitor was the first of a class of low-freeboard, turreted war
   ships developed during the Civil War by Swedish-American engineer and
   inventor John Ericsson. The Monitor was launched at Greenpoint, Long
   Island, on January 30, 1862. The ship was approxi mately 172 feet long
   with a beam of approx-i-mately 42 feet and was constructed almost
   entirely of iron. When fully loaded, it drew 9 feet of water. The
   Monitor was the first ship to have the engines and living spaces below
   the water line. The revo lving turret housed two XI-inch Dahlgren guns.
   In early March, the ship was sent to Hampton Roads, Virginia, to face
   the Confederate ironclad Virginia , (ex-USS Merrimack). On the morning
   of March 9, the Monitor and Virginia fo ught the first battle between
   ironclad warships. Despite the Virginia's much larger size and
   firepower, the Monitor clearly demonstrated the advantages of the
   revolving turret over traditional broadside guns. The battle marked the
   beginningo f the end for tradi-tional wooden ships of war and forever
   changed the way naval warfare was waged. The Monitor was lost in a
   storm off Cape Hatteras on December 31, 1862. Sixteen of her officers
   and crew were also lost.
   3. How is the site protected?
   NOAA protects the Monitor through comprehensive management and
   education programs, published regulations and cooperative agreements
   with state and federal agencies. The U.S. Coast Guard assis ts NOAA
   with the protection of the sanctuary through surveillance with boats,
   ships and aircraft.
   4. Are there activities that are prohibited in the Sanctuary?
   The USS Monitor belongs to the Am erican public. But like other things
   of value, the Monitor Sanctuary requires care and attention to endure
   for the benefit and enjoyment of future generations. Therefore, certain
   activities that could harm Sanctuary resources are prohibited without a
   permit from NOAA. These include:.
   (a) anchoring in any manner, stopping, remaining, or drifting without
   power at any time;
   (b) any type of subsurface salvage or recovery operation;
   (c) any type of diving whether by an individu al or by a submersible;
   (d) lowering below the surface of the water any grappling, suction,
   conveyor, dredging or wrecking device;
   (e) detonation below the surface of the water of any explosive or
   explosive mechanism;
   (f) seabed drilling or co ring;
   (g) lowering, laying, positioning or raising any type of seabed cable
   or cablelaying device;
   (h) trawling; or
   (j) discharging waste material into the water in violation of any
   Federal statute or regulation.
   5. Since the Monitor was a U.S. Navy ship, is the Navy involved in
   managing the site?
   In September 1953, the Secretary of the Navy signed documents
   officially abandoning title to the Monitor. However, the Navy has ma
   intained an interest in the Monitor and assists Sanctuary staff in
   historical and on-site research.
   6. Can the wreck of the Monitor be raised?
   The wreck of the USS Monitor has bee n studied by archaeologists,
   conservators, structural engineers, and corrosion experts. Most agree
   that the wreck cannot be recovered intact. Therefore, NOAA has ruled
   out complete recovery. However, experts also agree that recovery of
   major components, i ncluding the propeller, engine and associated
   material, and possibly the turret, is possible. Plans for recovery of
   major components from the wreck must also include plans for
   conservation, curation, and display.
   7. What kinds of artifacts have been recovered from the Monitor
   Sanctuary?
   Extensive research by NOAA and private groups has been conducted at the
   Sanctuary, and a wide variety of artifacts have been recovered,
   conserved, and ma de available for interpretation and display. These
   include a brass navigation lantern, small condiment and medicine
   bottles, pieces of cabinetry, part of a leather book binding, and
   ironstone dinnerware. The Monitor's unique four-fluked anchor was
   recovered in 1983 and is on display at The Mariners' Museum in Newport
   News, Virginia. Brass oarlocks, probably for the ship's boat, have also
   been recovered.
   8. I have read news articles about divers who visit th e Monitor and
   recover artifacts. Can anyone dive on the Monitor?
   The Monitor National Marine Sanctuary was designated to protect and
   preserve the wreck of the USS Monitor. Until recently, access to the
   Monitor was restricted to research. NOAA has issued a number of
   research permits to private and public groups interested in conducting
   research on the Monitor or its environment. In 1994, for the first
   time, divers were allowed to visit the Monitor for non-research
   purposes. A NOAA observer is aboard each private vessel that enters the
   Sanctuary to conduct diving operations, whether for research or
   non-research purposes. Under certain circumstances, members of these
   private groups have been allow ed to recover artifacts that were in
   danger of being lost. All artifacts remain the property of NOAA and are
   turned over to the NOAA observer for transport to The Mariners' Museum
   for conservation and eventual display.
   9. What is the role of The Mariners' Museum in Monitor Sanctuary
   activities?
   Location of the wreck of the Monitor and subsequent research activities
   have generated artifacts, historical research materials, and scientific
   da ta. In 1986, SRD recognized the importance of this valuable material
   by designating it the "Monitor Collection" and publicly acknowledged
   the need for a central repository that could provide proper curation.
   SRD then solicited proposals f rom qualified maritime museums
   interested in being designated Principal Museum for the Monitor
   Sanctuary. In March 1987, The Mariners' Museum was selected as
   Principal Museum and assumed curatorial responsibility for the Monitor
   Collection, including artifacts. All material resulting from
   NOAA-sponsored, on-site research is made part of the collection, as are
   all artifacts recovered from the site. The Sanctuary staff also accepts
   donations of private papers to the Collection. In May 1995, th e
   extensive research materials of the late Capt. Ernest W. Peterkin (USNR
   Ret.) became part of the Monitor Collection. The Collection remains a
   Federal Collection under the ultimate jurisdiction of the National
   Archives with The Mariners' Museum de signated a regional repository.
   The Museum also maintains a permanent Monitor exhibit and assists in
   the development and production of educational products and programs.
   Since 1991, the Museum and Sanctuary staff have cooperated on
   productiono f a paper model of the USS Monitor; publication of
   Cheesebox, the Sanctuary activities report; and development of a
   curriculum on the Monitor, the Monitor Sanctuary, and the National
   Marine Sanctuary Program for seventh-grade s tudents. Since most
   members of the public cannot visit the Monitor, these programs help
   bring the Monitor to the public.
   10. How can I find out about activities sponsored by or related to the
   Mo nitor and the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary?
   You can ask to be placed on the Monitor Sanctuary mailing list. With
   The Mariners' Museum, the Sanctuary staff publishes Cheesebox at least
   once a year. Cheesebox contains information on Monitor-related
   research, new publications, special events, exhibitions, and education
   opportunities. You can also contact the Sanctuary offices for
   infor-ma-tion on current events or research efforts. An information
   package on the Monitor Sanctuary is available from Sanctuary staff upon
   request. It contains Monitor Sanctuary and National Marine Sanctuaries
   brochures, a brochure on the Monitor Collection and "The Clash of
   Armor" exhibit at The Mariners' Museum, copies of Sanctuary Magazine,
   the current issue of Cheesebox, and an illustrated information booklet
   titled The Monitor National Marine Sanctuary: Past, Present and Future.
