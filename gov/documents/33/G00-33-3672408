     Established by Congress in 1981, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    Eleventh Judicial Circuit has jurisdiction over matters litigated in
    Alabama, and Florida and Georgia. The circuit includes nine districts
   with each state divided into Northern, Middle, and Southern districts.
   The court is one of the busiest federal appellate courts in the United
                States with twelve authorized judgeships.
     Approximately 78% of the courts cases are decided on submission of
      briefs by the parties while the remaining cases also include oral
       argument. Oral arguments are held in the Elbert P. Tuttle U.S.
       Courthouse in Atlanta, Georgia and are open to the public. Oral
      arguments are also held in Florida (Miami and Jacksonville), and
                            Alabama (Montgomery).
   Maps and directions to all Eleventh Circuit buildings are available on
                               this web site.
     For additional information, contact the Clerks Office at 56 Forsyth
           Street N.W., Atlanta, GA 30303. Phone: (404) 335-6100.
