   Did You Feel It?
   ShakeMap example Did You Feel It? example map
   Maps of measured ground motion (peak velocity and acceleration)
   obtained from seismic networks, and maps of shaking intensity estimated
   using these measurements. Maps are posted approximately 5 minutes after
   California earthquakes of Magnitude 3.5 and larger. If you felt an
   earthquake, add your observations to our database. You can also view
   live-updated maps displaying accumulated data from your report and
   others.
