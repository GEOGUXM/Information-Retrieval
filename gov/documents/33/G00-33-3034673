Flooding In Virginia

   Description of hydrologic event:
   Floods caused by rains on July 29-30, 2001 have peaked and flood waters
   are now receding. In Virginia, the North Fork Holston and Middle Fork
   Holston Rivers appear to have the greatest flooding. Recurrence
   intervals of flood peaks at streamgages on the North Fork Holston River
   were as great as 15 years (the discharge expected once every 15 years).
   Recurrence intervals of flood peaks at streamgages on the Middle Fork
   Holston River ranged from 20 to 40 years. Flood peaks in smaller basins
   upstream from these streamgages could be much greater.

   Below are the provisional peak stages and discharges caused by this
   rain event for selected gaging stations in the Kanawha, Big Sandy, and
   Tennessee River Basins. These gages, operated by the USGS or the
   Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ), have either
   satelite or telephone telemetry.
