                                    Mars

   Mars is known as the "Red planet" because iron in its surface soil long
   ago reacted with a tiny amount of oxygen left, making Mars rust.
   Materials here reveal facts, missions, and educational resources about
   Mars.

   Mars Exploration Program  - This website has past, present, and future
   Mars mission information, Mars facts, images, photo journals,
   spacecraft animation, images from Mars, and the latest news on current
   Mars exploration activity.


   [DIR] Design a Mission to Mars Guide - This Resource Guide for grades
   5-12 provides background information and learning activities for you to
   help your students participate in the NASA Student Involvement Program
   (NSIP) competition for 2001-2002. Experience how dedicated scientists
   work together to design a mission and learn from the new data it
   provides.
   [DIR] Earth and Mars - This NASA poster presents summaries of classroom
   activities containing basic concepts about Earth and Mars and their
   place in the Solar System. Full lesson plans are available online. A
   link is provided from this Spacelink page to the complete list of
   activities.
   [DIR] Exploring Meteorite Mysteries - The study of meteorites provides
   a unifying theme that links almost every aspect of Earth and planetary
   science with mathematics, physics, chemistry and even biology. This
   educator guide provides information and activities related to
   meteorites and their origins, whether it be Mars, asteroids, or the
   moon.
   [DIR] Is There Water on Mars - Investigations in this NASA Educator
   Guide explore the question of whether there is water on Mars.
   [DIR] Mars - The planet Mars is shown here with its northern polar cap
   and Valles Marineris. Also featured are topography maps from the Mars
   Orbiter Laser Altimeter and high resolution images of gullies taken by
   Viking.
   [DIR] Mars Pathfinder Lithograph Set - The Mars Pathfinder mission is
   part of a long-term program of Mars exploration being conducted by
   NASA's Office of Space Science. These four images highlight the types
   of scientific experiments and engineering tests that the rover
   Sojourner has conducted on Mars.
   [DIR] Mars Pathfinder Poster - Mars Pathfinder successfully landed on
   Mars in a region known as Ares Vallis (Mars Valley) on July 4, 1997.
   See images from Pathfinder and learn more about this first mission to
   send out a robotic rover to independently explore the surface.
   [DIR] Suited For Spacewalking - This guide begins with brief
   discussions of the space environment, the history of spacewalking,
   NASA's current spacesuit, and work that astronauts do during
   spacewalks. These are followed by classroom activities and a design
   brief that challenges students to design a spacesuit prototype for a
   Mission to Mars.
   [DIR] Viking Orbiter 1 Mars Mosaic - Images of Mars taken in 1980 by
   the Viking Orbiter 1 were used to form this dramatic mosaic of nearly a
   full hemisphere of the planet. PICS, a computer-based system, permitted
   each image to be aligned with the others in a manner like fitting
   together the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.

   and operate on the planet's surface. Learn more about Viking and its
   two (2) identical spacecraft, each consisting of a lander and an
   orbiter that supported this mission.

   NASA Projects: Mariner - The Mariner series of spacecraft were
   interplanetary probes designed to investigate Mars, Venus, and Mercury.
   The program included a number of firsts, including the first planetary
   flyby, the first planetary orbiter, and the first gravity assist.
