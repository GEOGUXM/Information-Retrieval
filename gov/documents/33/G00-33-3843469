Facilities

   The Reactor Engineering Division occupies 90,000 sq. ft., with
   approximately one-third of that space consisting of laboratories and
   high bay experimental areas.

   The Division maintains its own computer network based on Sun
   Microsystems, Inc. SPARC workstations, and has access to Argonne's
   advanced massively parallel computing facility.
