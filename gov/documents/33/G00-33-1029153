Subject: SK Update

Hi,

Many have heard by now of the SK disaster. Here is what I have
learned: Apparently an ID tube, most likely on the bottom of the
detector, imploded and set off a chain reaction destroying much of the
detector to about a depth of 2 meters or so below the current water
level. Apparently the top 7 supermodules and the top are intact.

The destruction is reported to be extensive with about 7000 ID and
1000 OD tubes destroyed. The various layers between the ID and OD are
shredded.  There appears to be huge piles of glass and other debris on
the tank bottom.  Waveshifter plates are shattered, cables perhaps
shredded, etc. The water is full of antimony and other hazardous
chemicals.

   Accident Curbs Japan Research Into Cosmos's Ghostly Particles By HOWARD
   W. FRENCH with DENNIS OVERBYE

   TOKYO, Nov. 12 - A huge underground chamber that made historic
   observations of ghostly particles called neutrinos that stream through
   the cosmos was crippled over the weekend when thousands of light
   detectors imploded in a chain reaction.

   The accident at Kamioka Neutrino Observatory, a large particle physics
   laboratory outside of Tokyo, is a major setback to research on the
   neutrino, one of nature's most elusive components. It brought to a halt
   an experiment that has been considered a candidate for a Nobel Prize.

   "People at the site heard a sound," said Hirotaka Sugawara, director of
   KEK accelerator laboratory. "it happened inside the water and surely
   must have had something to do with the pressure, but I will not comment
   further."

   He said the accident happened as the water tanks were being refilled
   after having been drained for maintenance. He called the accident "a
   huge tragedy" and said it would take at least a year to repair the
   damage.

   In confirming the accident, officials at Tokyo University gave few
   clues as to its origin, saying only that thousands of light detectors
   had been destroyed in the water-filled chamber, known as
   Super-Kamiokande. The neutrino detection apparatus relied upon roughly
   20-inch tubes called photomultipliers that lined a tank filled with
   very pure water, over 1,000 yards underground, to gather evidence of
   the particles, which have no charge and are so light that physicists
   thought for decades that they had no mass at all.

   But in 1998, experiments at Super- K established that at least one of
   the three types, or "flavors," in which neutrinos come must have at
   least some mass. This was big news for the universe because according
   to the standard calculations that describe the big bang that started
   the universe, neutrinos are the most populous elementary particles in
   the universe and their cumulative mass could have an effect on cosmic
   geography and the formation of galaxies.

   The Super-Kamiokande detector consists of 12.5 million gallons of water
   in a tank about the size of a cathedral a mile underground in the
   Kamioka zinc mine 180 miles northwest of Tokyo. It was completed in
   1996 at a cost of $100 million by a consortium of American and Japanese
   researchers.

   The tank is lined with 11,242 photomultiplier tubes spaced about a yard
   apart, which detect a bluish streak of light left in the water when a
   high- speed particle passes through. A researcher familiar with the
   experiment said compared the accident to corn popping or a string of
   firecrackers going off. About 7,000 of the detector's 11,000 tubes
   imploded, he said, each of which costs about $3,000. He estimated the
   total loss at $20 to $30 million. "Thank goodness we got our Nobel
   already cooking," he said. Appeal from the Director of the Kamioka
   Observatory
     __________________________________________________________________

Dear colleague,

As a director of the Kamioka Observatory, which owns and is
responsible to operate and maintain the Super-Kamiokande detector, it
is really sad that I have to announce the severe accident that
occurred on November 12 and damaged the significant part of the
detector. We would like to express our deep regret to Japanese, US and
Korean people who have generously supported the Super-Kamiokande
experiment. The cause and how to deal with the loss in future will be
discussed by newly found committees. However, even before discussing
with my colleagues of the Super-K and K2K collaborations, I have
decided to express my intension on behalf of the staff of the Kamioka
Observatory.

We will rebuild the detector. There is no question. The strategy may
be the following two steps, which will be proposed and discussed among
my colleagues.

1. Quick restart of the K2K experiment.  (1) We will clear the safety
measures which may be suggested by the committees, (2) reduce the
number density of the photomultiplier tubes by about a half, (3) use
the existing resources, (4) resume the K2K experiment as soon as
possible; the goal may be within one year.

2. Preparation for the JHF-Kamioka experiment.  (1) Restore the full
Super-Kamiokande detector armed with the state-of-the-art
techniques. (2) The detector will be ready by the time of the
commissioning of the JHF machine.

To achieve our objective is formidable but we are determined to do
so. We certainly need your encouragement, advice and help. I should
appreciate it very much if you could support our effort as you have
kindly done so before.

Best regards,
Yoji Totsuka
director, Kamioka Observatory
