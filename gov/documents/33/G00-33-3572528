   The Physics Research Equipment Pool (PREP) provides electronic
   instrumentation for high energy physics research experiments according
   to agreements (MOU's--memoranda of understandings) between approved
   experiment collaborations and Fermilab'sComputing Division.

   People with requests, questions, complaints and compliments are
   encouraged to send E-mail to (prep@fnal.gov). More information on the
