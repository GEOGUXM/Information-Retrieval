     * Average Depth: 19 feet
     * Shoreline Miles: 22.5 miles

   In cooperation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, the

   and 250,000 1" - 2" Hybrid Walleye (Saugeye) have been stocked into the
   lake with very good success.

   Rules/Regulations

   Anglers must possess a valid Illinois fishing license as required by
   law.
   Anglers using boats are limited to using a 10 horsepower (or less)
   engine. NO MOTORS ARE ALLOWED ON SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE LAKE FROM
   OCT. 15 - JAN. 1 TO ALLOW FOR MIGRATORY WATERFOWL.
   The minimum size and creel limits, in addition to those already stated
   by the Illinois statewide fishing regulations are:

       (Saugeye).
    2. 15-inch size limit for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass.
    3. 48-inch size limit for Musky.
    4. 25-fish daily creel limit on black and white crappie.

   Fish caught UNDER the size limits MUST be returned to the lake
   unharmed.
   No person shall take, catch, or attempt to take or catch any fish or
   other aquatic life from Evergreen Lake, Jone's Pond, or their
   tributaries, including below the spillway to the Mackinaw River, by any
   other method other than those state below:
    1. By means of not more than two poles and lines with no more than
       two hooks or lures attached to each. (Bank poles, trot lines, bush
       lines, seining, or jug fishing ARE PROHIBITED.)
    2. By means of bow and arrow for the taking of Carp, Buffalo,
       Suckers, Gar, and Bowfish only. (During archery deer
       season, however, ALL bow and arrow fishing is PROHIBITED).
    3. By means of a gig for the taking of Carp, Buffalo, suckers,
       Gar, Bowfish, and Frogs. (Frogs may be taken in OPEN

   ANNUAL FISHING CONTEST

   Comlara Park/Evergreen Lake holds an annual fishing contest from April
   1 through October 1. Categories include Crappie, Largemouth Bass,
   Channel Catfish, and Saugeye (Walleye Hybrid).

   Rules are as follows: 1.) All fish must be caught in Evergreen Lake or
   their tributaries within park boundaries. 2.) Fish must be weighed in
   at the Comlara Park Visitor's Center during office hours. 3.) Fish are
   weighed by park scales, and the heaviest fish at the end of the contest
   wins. In case of a tie, the longest fish will win. If there is still a
   tie after that, a coin flip will determine the winner. 4.) Largemouth
   Bass and Saugeye have minimum length limits set forth by the IDNR, and
   therefore must be at least the minimum length to enter in the contest.
   5.) Winners will receive a $25.00 gift certificate good towards any
   recreational activity at Comlara Park/Evergreen Lake.
