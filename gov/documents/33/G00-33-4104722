   1. Purpose. This chapter promulgates the National Weather Service's
   (NWS) procedures for the dissemination of information in the event of
   an earthquake and provides for cooperation with the United States
   Geological Survey (USGS) in reporting earthquake information to the
   National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC).

   1.1     Definitions. AFOS: Automation of Field Operations and Services.
   AFOS is an internal NWS communications network and field office
   computer system for data and product display, message composition, and
   message distribution. AFOS is used in the continental United States.
   AFOS will be phased out with the Modernization of the NWS. Earthquake
   Data: Specific data and computed information about an earthquake, such
   as phase arrival times and amplitudes, hypocentral locations in
   geographic coordinates, magnitudes, etc. Earthquake Magnitude: A
   measure of the size of an earthquake, obtained by measuring the
   amplitude of seismic waves on seismographs. The earthquake magnitude is
   related to the amount of energy released at the source of the
   earthquake. The first instrumental earthquake-magnitude scale was
   invented by Dr. Charles F. Richter.

   Macroseismic Information: Information on earthquake effects that are
   observed without the aid of seismic instruments, such as where the
   earthquake was felt, how strongly the earthquake was felt (e.g.,
   weakly, moderately, strongly), how many people felt the earthquake
   (e.g., a few, many, or all), damage caused by the earthquake, and
   casualties caused by the earthquake. Reference Exhibit F-61-1.

   Modified Mercalli Intensit 8 number between 1 and 12 that characterizes
   the severity of ground shaking at a given location by considering the
   effects of the shaking on people, man-made structures,  and the
   landscape (see Exhibit F-61-1). Intensities will be assigned to most
   communities in which the   earthquake was felt. Intensity values may
   differ depending on effects in each community.

   NWWS: NOAA Weather Wire Service. NOAA Weather Wire Service (NWWS) is a
   satellite broadcast system that delivers NWS text products to
   customers.

   2.    Earthquake Reporting Program. This program is established to
   disseminate earthquake information within the NWS and to the public. It
   functions in cooperation with the USGS to increase the effectiveness of
   the NEIC. The public and especially the NEIC value the information
   contained in these reports for earthquakes occurring within the United
   States. Located in Golden, Colorado, the NEIC is a component of the
   USGS's Office of Earthquakes, Volcanoes, and Engineering, Branch of
   Global Seismology and Geomagnetism.

   2.1    Scope. The procedures described in this Chapter are applicable
   to all NWS offices in the United States and its possessions, including
   National Centers, Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs), Weather Service
   Forecast Offices, Weather Service Offices, Weather Service
   Meteorological Observatories, NEXRAD Weather Service Forecast Offices ,
   NEXRAD Weather Service Offices, and the Alaska and Pacific Tsunami
   Warning Centers.

   2.2    Reporting Procedures. Distinct reporting procedures are
   described for the contiguous United States and Puerto Rico, and for
   offices in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, the Federated States
   of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, and the Republic of the Marshall
   Islands.

   2.2.1     Contiguous United States and Puerto Rico. NWS field offices
   are often the first to report macroseismic earthquake information to
   the NEIC. NWS earthquake information reports often trigger the NEIC to
   investigate an event, sometimes before earthquake data have been
   calculated from available seismic information. Therefore, NWS
   earthquake information reports are very important to the NEIC. See
   Exhibit F-61-2 for product identifiers and dissemination procedures.

   Earthquakes of intensity IV or greater on the Modified Mercalli Scale
   (see Exhibit F-61-1) should be reported immediately to NEIC using AFOS
   and NWWS (AFOS product identifier CCCEQREQI, WMO abbreviated header
   SEXX40, see Exhibit F-61-2). Intensity IV is defined as: During the day
   felt indoors by many, outdoors by few. At night some awakened. Dishes,
   windows, and doors disturbed; walls make creaking sound. Sensation like
   heavy truck striking building. Standing motorcars rocked noticeably.

   Information contained in the information reports should be factual and
   validated, if possible. Reports should be in plain language, avoiding
   abbreviations and local jargon and place names. If the affected area is
   large, it is possible that independent reports may be issued by several
   offices for the same event. These reports will be forwarded to the NEIC
   via the NWWS and the Defense Information Systems Agency AUTODIN system
   upon receipt from the NOAA Message Center in Silver Spring, Maryland.

   Since it may be some time--possibly several hours--before NEIC issues
   an official press release on an earthquake, each office issuing an
   Earthquake Information Report shall disseminate it, as soon as
   possible, over NOAA Weather Radio (NWR), in addition to AFOS and NWWS.
   Field office personnel should confirm with the NEIC that the event was
   an earthquake before disseminating the product. If desired,
   confirmation may be obtained by calling the NEIC duty geophysicist at
   303-273-8500 (see Exhibit F-61-3). During off-hours, the answering
   system will provide the home telephone numbers of the two duty
   geophysicists on call. Earthquake confirmation is recommended when it
   is not clear whether the shaking was caused by an earthquake or
   something else, such as quarry blast, sonic boom, etc.

   The NEIC will issue an Earthquake Alert: A General Message (see
   Exhibits F-61-2 and F-61-4) in accordance with established criteria.
   Once the message is received by the NWS field office, it should be
   disseminated on NWR, as soon as possible. Earthquake messages should
   remain on NWR for two or three cycles. An office may decide to
   broadcast a message for a longer duration if the earthquake is
   especially remarkable or if there is significant interest in the event.
   Note that earthquake information reports issued by NWS field offices
   contain macroseismic earthquake information and do not contain the
   Richter Scale magnitude. The Richter Scale magnitude is computed from
   seismic information (earthquake data) and will be provided by NEIC, as
   soon as possible. There is no correlation between Mercalli intensity
   and Richter magnitude.

   In addition to the real-time NWS Earthquake Information Reports, the
   Earthquake Questionnaire (Exhibit F-61-5) provides valuable information
   to the NEIC after the event. The Questionnaire should be completed and
   mailed to NEIC within 24 hours of earthquakes which meet the following
   criteria (Mercalli V):

   The questionnaire should be completed and mailed to NEIC for
   earthquakes that are of sufficient strength at local NWS field offices
   to knock objects off shelves, displace appliances, crack glass, or be
   perceived as strong enough to be alarming. Such earthquakes are
   substantially less frequent than earthquakes that are merely felt. If
   the earthquake makes a strong impression on the people or significantly
   displaces objects in an NWS field office, NEIC would like the
   questionnaire. If there is doubt as to whether the earthquake was
   sufficiently strong to merit completion of a questionnaire, field
   personnel can assume no report is needed.  A current version of the
   questionnaire is contained in Exhibit F-61-5.

   2.2.1.1     Earthquake Information Report format for AFOS NWWS, and
   NWR.   The NWS Earthquake Information Report should have the following
   general format:

      EARTHQUAKE FELT_____ BY ____ IN ____. _____ DAMAGE _______.
                                           (a)             (b)
   (c)     (d)                             (e)
   (a)    VERY STRONGLY, STRONGLY, MODERATELY, WEAKLY
   (b)    (single) OBSERVER, FEW, MANY, etc.
   (c)    Give locality or localities
   (d)    CONSIDERABLE, MODERATE, SLIGHT, NO
   (E)    Give brief description of damage, e.g., CHIMNEYS BROKEN, TOWERS
   FELL, STRUCTURES DESTROYED, WALLS CRACKED, DISHES RATTLED, BUILDING
   SHIFTED, CASUALTIES.

   In addition, it is necessary to add the following statement at the end
   of the Earthquake Information Report:

   INFORMATION RELEASED IN THIS STATEMENT IS PRELIMINARY. UPDATES,
   INCLUDING RICHTER SCALE MAGNITUDE, WILL BE MADE AS MORE INFORMATION
   BECOMES AVAILABLE FROM THE NATIONAL EARTHQUAKE INFORMATION CENTER IN
   GOLDEN, COLORADO.

   See Exhibit F-61-4 for an example of an Earthquake Information Report.

   If additional information concerning damage or injuries within the area
   of the reporting office becomes available within 24 hours of the time
   of the initial message, supplementary report(s) should be sent to NEIC
   with this information.

   2.2.2     Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, the Federated States of
   Micronesia, the Republic of Palua, and the Republic of the Marshall
   Islands.   Field offices in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, the
   Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, and the Republic
   of the Marshall Islands shall coordinate collection of macroseismic
   information with the Alaska and Pacific Tsunami Warning Centers 9ATWC
   and PTWC), respectively.  The ATWC and PTWC serve as supporting
   seisological observatories to the NEIC in addition to their primary
   function as NWS tsunami warning centers.  NWS field offices in Alaska
   and Hawaii shall communicate earthquake information reports, as
   outlined in section 2.2.1, to ATWC and PTWC using existing, internal
   communication circuits.  In turn, ATWC and PTWC will transmit
   earthquake information to NEIC using established communication
   circuits. WSOM Chapter F-60 (Tsunami Warnign Service) establishes
   policy for the tsunami warning program and provides additional guidance
   for the exchange and dissemination of earthquake data.   Earthquake
   reports of macroseismic information only (consolidated, prepared, and
   disseminated by ATWC and PTWC) for events below the threshold for
   issuing tsunami information bulletins should follow the report format
   outlined in section 2.2.1.1.   The reports shall be sent to NEIC using
   established communication circuits and disseminated over NWWS.  NWS
   field offices in the felt area of the earthquake shall broadcast the
   reports on NWR.

   2.3    Request for Reports.  Under some circumstances, the NEIC may
   request macroseismic information reports from NWS offices in a
   particular area, even if the level of shaking in the NWS office is not
   of an intensity that would normally warrant issuance of an Earthquake
   Information Report.  Requests should be complied with, as soon as
   possible, using the Earthquake Information Report format and
   transmitted as prescribed in sections 2.2.1.1 and 2.2.2.

   2.4    NEIC Earthquake Products.  Along with macroseismic information
   provided by the NWS, the NEIC collects additional descriptive and
   specific technical information to determine the various earthquake
   parameters.  NEIC then issues statements and bulletins for earthquakes
   occurring both domestically and around the world.

   Product identifiers and dissemination procedures for NEIC Earthquake
   Products are described in Exhibit F-61-2.  Examples of these products
   are displayed in Exhibit F-61-4.

   2.5    Customer Outreach.  NWS Warning Coordination Meteorologists
   (WCM) provide and interface between NWS filed offices and customers,
   including regional, state, county, and local emergency management
   officials.  WCMSs shall maintain a basic understanding of this Chapter,
   earthquakes in general, and earthquake risks in their area of
   responsibility, in order to carry out an effective earthquake reporting
   program in support of the NEIC.   This understanding may be obtained
   through interaction with the NEIC, FEMA Regional Offices, State,
   County, and Local Emergency Management, local Universities, and other
   sources of expertise. NWS WCMs should educate their customers,
   including emergency management officials, on earthquake information
   disseminated on NWWS and NWR. NWR should be considered an All Hazards
   dissemination tool. While WCMs are not responsible for being experts on
   earthquakes, they should assist emergency managers in earthquake
   preparedness and hazard mitigation activities to the fullest extent
   possible.
