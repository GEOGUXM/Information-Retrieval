                          Directions

        The Lynn CBOC is designed to establish communities access point for
         veterans in the Lynn, MA. area to meet the VAMC Bedford goals of:
        * Eliminate long distance travel to access care.
        * Reduce the need for the elderly and disabled veterans to travel in
          congested urban areas and inclement weather.
        * Reduce operating costs by shifting resources from inpatient to
          outpatient.
        * Establish a CBOC within an appropriate radius of the veteran
          population to increase accessibility due to congested urban and
          suburban roadways and winter driving.
        * Utilize the CBOC for pre-admission screening and discharge
          planning.
        * Implement patient care in a most cost effective, therapeutically
          appropriate setting.
        * Reduce access time by establishing a Primary Care access point.
        * Expand the continuum of clinical services so that patient care can
          be provided in the most cost-effective setting that is clinically
          appropriate.
        * Reduce beneficiary travel dollars.
        * Established the CBOC within legal authorities.
        * Operate the CBOC within existing resources.
