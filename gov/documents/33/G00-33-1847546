   This Reference Collection was established in 1982 to facilitate access
   to scientific and technical reports, publications, and information
   pertinent to USGS mapping research goals. This collection complements,
   rather than duplicates, the USGS Library Collections. It is classified
   with the Survey's classification system and cataloged under the
   Anglo-American Cataloging Rules, 2d edition.

   Although the primary purpose of this collection is to support the USGS
   National Mapping Program, its resources are available to other
   agencies, universities, research organizations, and the public on an
   in-house basis and through interlibrary loan. Periodicals, archival
   maps, and conference proceedings are not available on interlibrary
   loan. A limited amount of text copying, in accordance with copyright
   restrictions, is available.

   The Reference Collection includes works on:
     * Cartography - traditional and automated
     * Computer sciences, engineering, and software
     * Environment, global change studies, land use and land cover,
       natural resources studies and planning
     * Geography, geographic information systems, land information systems
     * Geophysics, geodesy, surveying, photogrammetry
     * Optics and photography
     * Remote sensing studies
     * Space sciences and satellites
     * Statistics, mathematics
     * Conference, symposia, and workshop proceedings, journals, and
       serials in the above fields.

   The Reference Collection also includes a separate Reports and
   Publications Archive, which consists of a collection of USGS NMD
   internal research reports, copies of published articles, and project
   reports by Mapping Division staff members. The materials in this
   archive are not available for loan, but may be used during the regular
   hours of service.

Historical Map Archives

   U.S. Geological Survey
   522 National Center
   Room 2B125
   Reston, VA 20192 USA

   Telephone: (703) 648-4800
   E-mail: NMD Reference Collection

   Hours: 8 a.m. - 4 p.m., Monday - Friday.

   The Historical Map Archives were established after publication of the
   first USGS topographic maps in the early 1880's. The archives include
   maps from the 1880's to date and are divided into three chronological
   segments: 1880's-1933, 1934-84, and 1985-to date.

   The archives are designed to maintain at least one copy of each
   published or reprinted topographic sheet but the archives are not
   complete, especially for the early years. The maps are filed
   chronologically and alphabetically, by State and by quadrangle name.
   Computer-based indexes of the 1880's-1933 and the 1985-to date segments
   have been prepared.

   Archival maps are not available on loan but may be viewed for research
   purposes.
