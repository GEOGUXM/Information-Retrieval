                                   SUMMARY

   The Energetic Particles: Acceleration, Composition and Transport
   (EPACT) investigation is designed to make comprehensive observations of
   solar, interplanetary, and galactic particles over wide ranges of
   charge, mass, and intensity using a combination of 8 different particle
   telescopes.

   Energetic particles are electrons or ions of all the chemical elements
   that have been accelerated to speeds of one tenth of the speed of light
   or more. These particles are accelerated in solar flares and at shock
   waves driven out from the Sun by fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
   They are accelerated in planetary magnetospheres and bow shocks and at
   the heliospheric termination shock where the solar wind runs into
   interstellar material (these latter particles are called anomalous
   cosmic rays (ACRs). The galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are accelerated by
   shock waves from distant supernovae.

   We can observe particles from all these sources in the near-Earth
   environment. By measuring the energy spectra and element abundances of
   the energetic particles, and their variation with time, we can
   distinguish all these sources and study the physics of particle
   acceleration on a broad scale.

   When energetic particles interact with matter or magnetic fields, they
   generate photons in the form of X-rays, gamma rays, and radio emission.
   We can see these photons from the distant parts of our galaxy and
   beyond, but we cannot see the energetic particles that produce them.
   Thus, our own heliosphere serves as a local laboratory where we can
   study the fundamental physics of the energetic processes that occur
   throughout the cosmos.

      Particle Acceleration at the Sun and in the Heliosphere -- review
                                   article
                     ___________________________________

   Electrons are measured from 0.2 to 10 MeV, primarily providing time
   markers for injections of solar particles. Hydrogen is measured from
   1.4 to 120 MeV, and Helium is measured from 0.04 to 500 MeV/nucleon.
   The collection powers and energy ranges for heavier nuclei up to iron
   are ideal for observations of quiet-time populations such as particles
   accelerated by interplanetary shocks and the anomalous cosmic rays. The
   large collecting power available is ideal for observing 3He, 4He, and
   heavier nuclei in impulsive solar events. For the first time it may be
   possible to observe ultra heavy nuclei (Z> 30) in large solar events.
   Finally, there is also a telescope designed to measure isotopes from He
   to Fe, which is intended for solar particles, anomalous cosmic rays,
   and galactic cosmic rays. There will be important opportunities for
   combined studies with other spacecraft, such as SAMPEX, Ulysses, and
   Voyagers 1 and 2.

                                   LAUNCH

   The Wind spacecraft was launched at 04:30 EST on Nov. 1, 1994 aboard a
   Delta rocket. The orbit is designed to make several passes through the
   magnetosphere and then move into a halo orbit around the earth-sun L1
   Lagrange point.

                           INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTIONS

                                  Overview

   The EPACT investigation must make measurements over an extremely broad
   range of elements, energies, and intensities. As a result, EPACT
   consists of multiple telescopes that also provide a level of protection
   against single-point failures. The Low Energy Matrix Telescope (LEMT)
   consists of three identical telescopes, whereas ELITE consists of two
   Alpha-Proton-Electron (APE) telescopes and an Isotope Telescope (IT).
   LEMT and ELITE have been designed, built and tested by the Low Energy
   Cosmic Ray Group and the Electronics Systems Branch of the Laboratory
   for High Energy Astrophycis at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
   Later, the Suprathremal Energetic Particle telescope system (STEP) was
   added to EPACT. STEP contains two identical telescopes. STEP was
   designed and built by the University of Maryland.

   All the telescopes except for those in STEP use the dE/dx by E method
   of particle identification. Solid-state detectors are used throughtout
   for reliability and long-term stability. STEP measures time-of-flight
   and energy, from which particle mass can be obtained. Each STEP
   telescope includes a start and stop microchannel plate detector as well
   as a solid-state detector to measure the total energy.

                   The Low Energy Matrix Telescope (LEMT)

   The front dE/dx elements are 16 surface barrier detectors arrayed on a
   spherical dome in order to minimize path-length variations. Each
   detector is nominally 1.75 cm^2 by 18 microns thick. The residual E
   detector is an ion-implanted detector 36 cm^2 by 1000 microns thick. It
   is subdivided into five 13.3 mm wide strips on each side.

                     The Electron Isotope System (ELITE)

                 The Alpha-Proton-Electron (APE) Telescopes

   The primary purpose of the APE telescopes is to provide coverage of the
   lowest charge particles over a wide range of incident energies up to
   very high rates. The APE telescopes do ovserve heavy nuclei up through
   iron, however, and can resolve isotopes of the lighter elements without
   trajectory information.

   APE-A consists of four detectors. The A1 and A2 detectors are circular
   silicon surface barrier detectors, nominally 150 microns thick by 8
   cm^2. Double foils are used in front of the telescope to protect the A1
   detector from sunlight and from high counting rates due to particles at
   energies just below the APE-A energy range. The A3 and A4 detectors are
   circular Lithium drifted detectors (LiDs) 3 mm thick by 17 cm^2. The
   telescope acceptance geometry is defined by a coincidence between the
   A1 and A2 detectors in anti-coincidence with the A4 detector. The
   geometry factor for the telescope is 1.2 cm^2 sr, independent of
   energy.

   APE-B consists entirely of LiD detectors. The B1 and B2 detectors are
   curved (radius of curvature of 7.0 cm) to minimize path length
   variations. The maximum variation is 2.8 % for particles not passing
   through an edge of B1 or B2. Particles stopping in APE-B are identified
   by a coincidence condition of B1 * B2* ~C7 (~ means NOT). The geometry
   factor for stopping particles is 1.3 cm^2 sr. Particles stopping in B2
   are referred to as 2-D particles, while those penetrating B2 and
   stopping in one of C1 through C6 are referred to as 3-D particles.
   Penetrating particles are also accepted for analysis. This expands the
   energy range to include minimum ionizing particles. Penetrating
   particles include both particles which enter through B1 and exit
   through D (forward particles) and those which enter D and exit B1
   (backward particles). APE B has been mounted on a short tower with an
   unobstructed 180 degree view to allow both types of particles. The
   geometry factor for penetrating particles is 1.95 x 1.08 cm^2 sr, after
   allowing for 5% obstruction of the FOV by the spacecraft.

                            The Isotope Telescope

   This instrument consists of 8 silicon detectors. The first two
   detectors are two dimensional position sensitive detectors (PSDs). They
   are required so that path-length corrections may be made for the angle
   of incidence and for nonuniformities in detector thickness. The
   electrodes on each side of each PSD are segmented into 125 strips with
   a pitch of 0.5 mm and an inter-strip gap of 35 microns. The strips are
   interconnected by 68 ohm chip resistors at the periphery of the
   detector wafer. Preamplifiers connected to strips 1, 32, 63, 94, and
   125 subdivide each PSD into 4 sections of 32 strips each. From the
   signal on the 5 preamplifiers, the particle position can be measured.
   This technique works well for nuclei with charge Z > 2. For He, the
   isotopes are well separated, even with poor spatial resolution. The
   next 5 detectors below the PSDs (E1 - E5) vary in thickness from 150
   microns to 8 mm. Multiple dE/dx measurements are possible with this
   system.

              The Suprathermal Energetic Particle System (STEP)

   Below is a picture of the STEP instrument. The protective doors provide
   an extension of the sun shade at the entrance to each STEP telescope.
   The measurement technique used in STEP is Time-of-flight vs Total E. In
   each of two identical telescopes, incoming nuclei enter through a pair
   of thin nickel foils, pass through a time-of-flight region and strike a
   surface barrier silicon solid state detector located at the rear of the
   telescope. The detector is thick enough to stop all particles of
   interest and the detector signal thus represents the total energy of
   the particle. This energy signal is detected by a standard
   charge-sensitive amplifier, shaped with a peaking time of 1 microsecond
   and run through a pair of discriminator amplifiers and a pair of
   parallel linear amplifiers of differing gain. Two amplitude
   discriminators set to 80 keV and 10 MeV allow us to select which of the
   two linear amplifier outputs to analyze. The high gain linear amplifier
   generates a full scale output for an input of about 12 MeV, the low
   gain channel handles up to about 60 MeV.

   In parallel with the energy, the time of flight is analyzed. As the
   incoming ion passes through the inner nickel foil, it knocks a few
   secondary electrons off the inner surface of the foil into the TOF
   region. These electrons are accelerated by a 1 kV potential within the
   chamber and are directed toward a chevron pair of microchannel plates
   (MCPs) which detects them and multiplies them by roughly 107, producing
   a measurable signal. The output signal is designated as START. A
   similar STOP signal is derived from the back-scattered secondary
   electroncs produced when the incoming ion strikes the front surface of
   the solid state detector. The time between the two signals equals the
   time taken by the ion to traverse the TOF chamber and is typically 2 -
   100 nsecs. The START and STOP signals are processed through
   constant-fraction discriminators to reduce "walk" and drive a
   time-to-amplitude converter (TAC) whose output represents the
   time-of-flight of the ion. Logic circuitry is used to detect the
   coincidence of a STOP signal occurring within 100 nsec of a START and
   signals this coincidence by generating a VALID STOP pulse.
