   Argonne National Laboratory is operated for the United States
   Department of Energy (DOE) by the University of Chicago.

   In addition to the DOE, almost all of EAD's customers are governmental
   agencies (federal, state, and international) or not-for-profit research
   institutions. Under special circumstances where specific EAD
   capabilities are required, EAD may be able to assist private sector
   entities. Arrangements to assist non-DOE customers are conveniently
   made through DOE's well-established Work-for-Others (WFO) program.

   Details concerning contracting and funding arrangements can be provided
