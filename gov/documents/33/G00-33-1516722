   Why We Need ECO
   FACE & Ameriflux?
   3dGlobe5Small.gif (49732 bytes) Global C Flux (Background)

   The difference between annual photosynthesis or carbon assimilation (A)
   and respiration (R) of the terrestrial biosphere is the primary driver
   of annual variability in the atmospheric inventory of CO[2] over
   periods of years to a decade or two. It is likely that the ratio A:R
   may change significantly as the concentration of atmospheric CO[2]
   ([CO[2]][atm]) increases or if the world warms, or gets wetter, or if
   increased cloud cover changes global albedo. Since the global uptake of
   carbon by photosynthesis is on the order of 100 Â±25 PgC annually, and R
   is thought to be about 1 PgC less than A, slight changes in these large
   numbers may be significant indeed compared to the ~5 PgC emitted due to
   fuel combustion. We cannot now predict future concentrations of
   [CO[2]][atm] with reasonable precision because we do not know how the
   biosphere will interact with variables of global change, particularly
   increasing [CO[2]][atm] itself. We do not have in place either the
   tools for global-scale monitoring of ecosystem function and carbon
   sequestration, or an integrated program for evaluating how the
   terrestrial biosphere will respond to changes in [CO[2]][atm] or
   climate. A distributed, global-scale facility is being proposed that
   will provide both the program and the tools.

   The terrestrial biosphere is the primary regulator of [CO[2]][atm].
   Measurement errors for global biosphere-atmosphere flux are much too
   large for reasonable estimates of future [CO[2]][atm].

   Errors in estimating future biosphere C flux dwarf potential regulatory
            adjustments to global GHG (Greenhouse gas emissions).

   The Environmental Carbon Observatory (ECO) will monitor the function of
   the global terrestrial ecosystem, particularly the net uptake or
   release of CO[2]. This will be accomplished with observation and
   experimentation units distributed throughout the world. ECO is proposed
   as the mechanism for integrating global-scale science in order to
   obtain synoptic understanding of the carbon cycles of the major
   components of the terrestrial biosphere and improved predictive
   capability to understand how activities of human kind may alter the
   coupled biosphere-climate system.

   The following pages are not a presentation of the entire concept, but
   an argument as to why two existing programs sponsored primarily by
   DOE/OBER, Free-Air CO[2] Enrichment (FACE) and the eddy flux
   measurement network, Ameriflux, should be expanded and integrated (with
   other elements) to form ECO. It should also be noted that this program
   does not address the pressing need to improve understanding of how
   marine systems currently interact with the atmosphere and how they
   might interact in the future. Integration of ECO with marine-based
   programs to provide a complete global carbon model will be an important
   task for the USGCRP.

   Why do we need ECO?

   Why Integrate FACE & Ameriflux?

   FACE experiments and the Ameriflux network are not aimed at different
   issues and questions, but at sub-components of the same over-arching
   system. They are both aimed at understanding and quantifying the
   exchange of carbon between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere.
   Ameriflux addresses contemporary net carbon exchange, while FACE
   addresses the mechanisms regulating both current and future carbon
   cycle processes. Ameriflux cannot address future responses to
   environmental change without FACE (or a redundant program similar to
   FACE). FACE cannot be regionalized without Ameriflux (or a parallel
   effort of similar scope). Expansion and integration of the two program
   elements (with other elements) will allow measurement and prediction of
   global ecosystem function and feedback regulation of [CO[2]][atm] that
   cannot otherwise be obtained.

   The distributed ECO facility will be an extraordinary tool that will
   favor the integration of information across disciplines, among Federal
   laboratories, and throughout the scientific community. This integration
   will lead to process-centered, earth-based ecology with a global scope
   that is unprecedented in both vision and execution in any of the
   constituent disciplines. In short, combining FACE and Ameriflux (with
   other elements) into ECO will create an extraordinary tool for
   extraordinary science. This is a tool that can play a leading role in
   developing scientific knowledge for the protection of the living
   planet.
