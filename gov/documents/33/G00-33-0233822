"From Arboretums to Your Garden"

   Red Rose For almost 75 years, the U.S. National Arboretum's Floral and
   Nursery Plants Research Unit (FNPRU) has been a leader in the
   development of new and improved floral and nursery products. The
   446-acre arboretum's advances in genetic improvement and disease
   control of landscape plants and major cut flowers have, in no small
   part, contributed to the rapid growth of the floriculture crop sector
   of American agriculturewhich had a $3.5 billion wholesale value in
   1998. (See "Floral Gems," Agricultural Research, September 1997, pp.
   813.)

   FNPRU's research activities have helped spur the burgeoning floral and
   nursery crops industries in myriad ways. From their germplasm
   improvement, taxonomy studies, and development of virus- or
   pest-resistant plants to the creation of plant pathogen detection
   methods and genetic transformation technologies, the research unit's
   scientists continue to engage some of the horticulture industry's most
   enduring challenges.
    "A 1996 horticulture research initiative spearheaded by ARS
   Administrator Floyd P. Horn has been tremendously beneficial to the
   industry," says Mary Ashby Pamplin. She previously directed
   horticultural research for the American Nursery and Landscape
   Association.

   "Through labs like the FNPRU, ARS does something that we as an industry
   cannot; that is, conduct the long-term, high-risk, and costly basic
   research that forms the building blocks for the industry's own research
   programs," Pamplin says. "ARS is in a perfect position to coordinate
   research across disciplines at a very high level and to effectively
   communicate its findings."

   This cooperation with industry informs much of what ARS scientists
   accomplish at FNPRU and at the more than 100 ARS laboratories across
   the country and abroad and provides researchers with an incentive to
   find solutions to difficult challenges.
   Following are some research programs that highlight the depth and
   breadth of FNPRU's activities: Ornamental Virology
   Over the last 10 years, the FNPRU has been engaged in detecting,
   identifying, and characterizing several viruses affecting ornamental
   crops. Among the tools scientists use are antibodies, electron
   microscopy, and nucleic acid hybridization. These approaches include
   developing control procedures to prevent or minimize virus
   transmission, finding reagents to quickly detect and screen viruses,
   and quarantine interception and epidemiology.

   Using Genetics To Plum the Depths of Plant Diseases
   The plum pox virus (PPV) research program, led by plant pathologist
   John Hammond, has yielded sensitive detection techniques that not only
   confirm the presence of PPVa disease that affects stone fruits like
   plums, peaches, and their ornamental relativesbut also distinguish
   between severe and less virulent strains of the disease and help
   determine their origins and modes of transmission. (See related story
   on p. 9.) To the $1.3 billion annual U.S. stone fruit industry, this
   kind of research is critical.
       Hammond uses a technique called the polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR), which multiplies the number of target molecules in a sample's
   nucleic acid. Having enough copies helps researchers detect any
   particular strain of PPV. "We've been able to develop PCR primers that
   initiate this process," says Hammond. "The process allows us to more
   readily detect all PPV strains." If scientists can detect different
   strains, it may help them find a correlation between a particular
   strain and its ability to infect a specific type of host plant.


     New Chinese redbud cultivar, named Don Egolf


   In addition, Pooler's release of a new Syringa cultivar named Betsy
   Ross has provided the industry with a new lilac acclaimed for its
   fragrant white flowers, lush green foliage, compact growth habit,
   disease tolerance, and adaptation to warmer climates. One significant
   advance has been the new lilac's tolerance to powdery mildewthe biggest
   disease problem for lilacs in the Washington, D.C., area. The new shrub
   thrives under full sun and can be used as a background planting in a
   shrub border or as a specimen plant or hedge. It can be planted
   throughout USDA hardiness zones 5 to 7.


    New Redbuds and Lilacs Grace America's Gardens
   FNPRU's Margaret R. Pooler has released a new Chinese redbud cultivar
   named Don Egolf, a variety of Cercis chinensis whose profusion of
   rosy-purple flowers, compact structure, ease of propagation,
   seedlessness, and apparent high tolerance to Botryosphaeria dothidia
   canker have made it a welcome newcomer to nurseries across the country.
   Since 1994, cooperating nurseries throughout the eastern, southern, and
   midwestern United States have evaluated Don Egolf with high acclaim.
   Its ease of propagation by rooted cuttings is an especially valuable
   trait, because redbud cultivars are notoriously difficult to propagate.
   Because the cultivar is seed-sterile, it produces no fruitenhancing the
   shrub's winter appearance.

    A Rose Is a Rose Is a Rose
   Researchers at FNPRU have also developed a new technique to enable
   transformation of genetically diverse varieties of rosesthe number-one
   cut flower in the United States. One of the principal obstacles to the
   genetic engineering of roses has been an inability to develop a whole
   plant from genetically engineered cells. "This technique has already
   been applied to three rose varieties with great success," says Kathryn
   K. Kamo, a plant physiologist. The new method can potentially be used
   to genetically introduce traits such as resistance to black spot, along
   with quality traits, like scent, color, and heat tolerance.


    Nightmare on Elm Street Is Over
   The tree-breeding program at FNPRU has successfully bred red maples
   with both good fall color and leafhopper resistance; elms with
   tolerance to Dutch elm disease and elm yellows; superior alder and
   hackberry; and hemlock with wooly adelgid resistance. New hemlock
   hybrids are being verified with the use of molecular markers.
   Two technicians examine rose cultivars.    Over the past 20 years,
   plant geneticist Denny Townsend has worked to develop the first
   commercially available elm varieties that are tolerant to Dutch elm
   disease. After their long-awaited arrival in wholesale nurseries in
   1997 and retail nurseries in 1999, the American elm is well on its way
   to gracing our boulevards and backyards once again.

   Novel Approaches to Plant Breeding
   Plant geneticist Robert J. Griesbach, with FNPRU, has been developing
   five new Ornithogalum hybrids. The best-known species of this bulbous
   plant is the Star-of-Bethlehem. These new hybridsfor which patent
   applications have been filedintroduce new colors and growth habits
   through interspecific breeding and embryo rescue techniques. The
   introduction of disease resistance is projected in the future through
   genetic engineering. According to Griesbach, he and colleagues have
   been able to develop whole plants from rescued embryos that have been
   germinated from immature seeds. "Under normal circumstances these
   embryos would die," he says. "The resulting plants have larger, fuller
   flowers and stronger, longer stems."
