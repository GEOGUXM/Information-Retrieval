   The Office of Health Policy (HP) is responsible for major activities in
   the areas of policy coordination, legislation development, strategic
   planning, policy research and evaluation, and economic analysis. AlsoHP
   often serves in a coordinating role for cross-cutting policy and
   administrative activities. Much of our work is fast-paced, due to this
   direct involvement in the policy-making process. We work closely with
   other staff in the Office of the Secretary, as well as the HHS
   operating divisions, the White House, OMB, Treasury, Labor, and
   Congress.

   Almost every major issue in health policy comes through our office in
   some form. More information is available about the work of the
   divisions which make up the office.
