    Frequently Asked Questions Concerning Appeals to the Commissioner of
    Education
        ____________________________________________________________

    1. How do I bring an appeal?

       The procedures for bringing an appeal are described in Education
       Law ยง310 and the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education at 8
       NYCRR Part 275 et seq. (the "regulations"). A copy of these
       regulations may be available at your local library. They are also
       available on the Department's web site at www.counsel.nysed.gov,
       and are set forth in Handbook 1, a copy of which is available upon
       request by writing to the Office of Counsel, New York State
       Education Department, 89 Washington Avenue, Albany, New York 12234,
       or by telephoning (518)474-8927.
    2. Can I bring a lawsuit in court if I have a grievance against a
       school district, or must I first appeal to the Commissioner?

       In all cases except election disputes, you have the choice of
       commencing a proceeding in court rather than an appeal to the
       Commissioner. Election disputes, however, must be decided by the
       Commissioner.
    3. Do I need to hire a lawyer to bring an appeal?

       No. However, there are advantages to representation by a lawyer.
       The appeal process is a legal proceeding which raises legal
       questions that may best be understood and addressed with the help
       of an attorney.
    4. Is there a time limit on when I can bring an appeal?

       Yes. You must serve your papers (see the regulations referenced
       above for rules on proper service) no more than thirty (30) days
       after the action you are challenging has taken place. For example,
       if you are challenging a decision by the board of education to
       suspend your child, you must bring your petition within 30 days of
       the board's final determination to suspend. Appeals brought more
       than 30 days later will be dismissed by the Commissioner.
    5. Does the Commissioner ever allow a late appeal?

       The rules on timing are very strict. In thousands of decisions
       issued over the years, the Commissioner has rarely excused
       lateness. The fact that a petitioner did not know of the
       availability of the appeal process or did not understand it is not
       a legal excuse for bringing a late petition. Nor is illness or
       inability to obtain the documents necessary to begin an appeal.
       Finally, continued discussions or efforts to resolve the dispute
       between a petitioner and a school district do not extend the time
       for bringing an appeal. A petitioner attempting to bring an appeal
       beyond the 30 day time period must state the reasons for his or her
       failure in the petition.
    6. What do I have to prove to prevail in an appeal and obtain the
       relief I requested from the Commissioner?

       The burden of proving a case is on you as the petitioner. You must
       show through documentary evidence, pleadings that are verified
       (sworn to as correct and accurate) and affidavits that you have
       been directly injured by the district's action. You must show that
       the respondent (usually the school district) either (1) violated a
       statute or regulation; or (2) acted arbitrarily and capriciously.
    7. How do I show that a district acted arbitrarily and capriciously?

       To demonstrate arbitrary or capricious actions, a petitioner must
       prove that the actions of the district were wholly without a
       rational or reasonable basis. It is not enough to show that the
       district could have made a better or different determination, or
       that you as a petitioner disagreed with the action or determination
       that you are challenging. You must instead show that the district's
       action has no rational, reasonable support or explanation.
    8. Will the Commissioner reverse a district's decision/action and
       grant my petition if he believes the district could have acted
       differently?

       No. The Commissioner gives great deference to decisions by local
       officials. Even if the Commissioner would have decided the matter
       differently himself, he will not substitute the district's judgment
       with his own unless, after a review of the entire record, he can
       find no rational, reasonable basis for the district's actions.
    9. If respondent does not submit a verified answer, is my appeal
       automatically granted?

       No. If a respondent fails to answer, the statements in the petition
       are deemed to be true. The statements and evidence, however, must
       still establish that the petitioner is legally entitled to the
       requested relief.
   10. What will the Commissioner consider in making his determination?

       The Commissioner will consider only documents that are properly
       part of the record before him (i.e., verified pleadings,
       affidavits, or reports or records of the State Education
       Department). The Commissioner will not consider facts that are
       outside of the record (i.e., information provided by telephone
       calls to the Department, copies of newspaper articles, or oral
       statements not made part of the record by affidavit).
   11. Is there any way to anticipate how the Commissioner will decide my
       petition?

       The Commissioner's decisions are based upon law. The law is set
       forth in statutes and regulations, and interpretations of law are
       reflected in previous Commissioner's decisions. Petitioners are
       encouraged to review these decisions, which give guidance on how
       the Commissioner might rule in a similar case based on similar
       facts. (The decisions are published in New York State Education
       Department Reports, which may be available in your local library.
       Decisions are also available on the Department's web site at
       www.counsel.nysed.gov) For example, the decisions show that the
       Commissioner rarely, if ever, reverses a district's determination
       on: the placement of a bus stop; the configuration of attendance
       zones; the calculation of a student grade; or the denial of a
       transportation request. See also question numbers 6 and 7 above.
   12. Are there some grievances that the Commissioner will not decide?

       Yes. The Commissioner has no authority to decide alleged violations
       of the Open Meetings Law or Freedom of Information Law. Thus, the
       Commissioner will not decide claims that a school district failed
       to hold an open meeting or wrongfully refused a request for
       documents. Such claims must instead be brought before a court.
       Moreover, the Commissioner has no authority to award money damages.
   13. Once I file a petition, when can I expect a decision?

       A petition is not ready for review by the Commissioner's legal
       staff until all of the papers in the case (answer, reply and
       briefs) have been filed. The regulations establish timeframes for
       filing these documents. Because of those timeframes, a file is
       actually not complete until approximately eight weeks after the
       initial petition is filed. This time period may be even longer, if
       the parties request and receive from the Commissioner's staff
       extensions of time for service. Once the file is complete, we
       endeavor to issue a decision within six to eight months (i.e.,
       eight to ten months after the petition is filed). However, hundreds
       of complex appeals are filed each year, so it is impossible to
       guarantee a specific date.
   14. Can I telephone or write the Department to learn about the status
       of my appeal or when a decision will be issued?

       Much like a court with a case that is pending before a judge, the
       Department and Commissioner do not provide information about the
       decision-making process or the status of a decision once a petition
       is filed. However, we make every effort to decide each appeal as
       expeditiously as possible. Please be patient and understand that
       time spent responding to inquiries about appeal status is time
       taken away from the decision-making process.
   15. When will the Commissioner remove a member of the board of
       education from office?

       The Commissioner has the power to remove a trustee, member of the
       board of education and certain other school officers for wilful
       misconduct or neglect of duty. However, the Commissioner will not
       remove a district officer unless it is clearly established that the
       officer acted intentionally and with a wrongful purpose to (1)
       violate the law, (2) neglect his duty, or (3) disobey a decision,
       order or regulation of the Commissioner. The Commissioner will not
       remove a school officer if he or she has merely used poor judgment.
   16. Do I use the same forms for filing an application for removal as I
       do for an appeal?

       Generally, the forms are the same. However, the notice for removal
       of a school officer is different. In addition, the petition must
       state clearly the wilful violation charged against the officer and
       the facts that show a wilful violation. Please refer to Part 277 of
       the Commissioner's Regulations (8 NYCRR Part 277).
   17. If I request a stay order, when will I receive a decision on my
       request?

       If a respondent opposes a stay request, the respondent must serve
       and file affidavits in opposition to the request within three
       business days after service of the petition. The Commissioner
       generally renders a decision on the stay request within several
       days of receiving respondent's opposition papers. Stays are granted
       only in extraordinary circumstances.
   18. If the respondent does not oppose my stay request, is my request
       automatically granted?

     No. The Commissioner will still review the petition to determine
     whether the petitioner is likely to succeed on the merits and
     whether petitioner will be irreparably harmed in the absence of a
     stay.
