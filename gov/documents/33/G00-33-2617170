   SIMULATING THE MARTIAN SURFACE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WORLD
   University of Arkansas
   Fayetteville, Arkansas


         Dr. Nancy Chabot of Case Western Researve University with the
   Arkansas-Oklahoma Center for Space and Planetary Sciences radiation
             dosimetry experiment near the Darwin Glacier, Antarctica.

      FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- An experiment designed by the Arkansas-Oklahoma
      Center for Space and Planetary Sciences, now in place on the polar
   plateau of Antarctica, may help interpret the recent history of Mars.

   The NASA-funded experiment, built by professors Derek Sears and Paul
   Benoit, University of Arkansas, and Stephen McKeever, Oklahoma State
   University, is designed to measure the ability of ice to stop
   high-energy "cosmic rays," or protons traveling at high speeds. Cosmic
   rays occur in outer space, and penetrate the atmospheres of Earth and
   Mars. Rocks and soil stop cosmic rays as the protons crash into the
   atoms in the solids, releasing energy and storing some of that energy
   within the soil and rocks as luminescence. Researchers can measure this
   luminescence and determine the age of the object in question.

   Up until now there has been little interest in gathering luminescence
   data for ice -- researchers usually use the technique to date pots and
   campfires in archaeology or to determine radiation exposure in
   laboratories. However, as scientists have learned more about the polar
   ice caps on Mars, their interest in dating ice has blossomed.

   Antarctica provides an ideal environment for the luminescence
   experiment due to the presence of old, dense ice far from rock outcrops
   that could produce radiation. Antarctic ice, which flows at a slow
   rate, makes an Earth-based "lab" site that most closely resembles the
   polar ice caps found on Mars.

   The experiment is part of a larger effort to produce a spacecraft
   instrument, called ODIN, to study the polar ice caps of Mars. The
   instrument used in Antarctica will date how long ice deposits have been
   stable by measuring the amount of radiation exposure they have
   experienced.

   "The Antarctic case is really just a test case for Mars -- if we can
   work successfully with Antarctic ice, Mars shouldn't prove any more
   difficult," Benoit said.

   The experiment was placed 1.5 meters into the ice near the Meteorite
   Hills on Dec.10, 2001, by a field party lead by Ralph Harvey from the
   Antarctic Search for Meteorites (ANSMET), sponsored by the National
   Science Foundation, and will return home with the expedition in early
   February.
