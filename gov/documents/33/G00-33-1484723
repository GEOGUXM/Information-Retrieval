                                Man Page Gateway

   This is a gateway to the man pages on the PPPL Unix cluster. Type in a
   man page name. You can optionally specify a section (e.g., 1 for
   commands, 5 for file formats, 3 for library routines), an operating
   system, the format, and the precedence of the manpages. The formats
   HTML and text are actually nearly the same. HTML will usually give you
   better output (e.g., for maple(1)). On the other hand HTML output
   completely fails for some man pages (e.g., for perl(1))., and in that
   case, the text format is obviously better. The Postscript format will
   provide you will a version which is best for printing; this version is
   also available via a link called PRINTED VERSION from the other
   formats.

   Select man page: ______________________________,
   (optional) section: ____, and OS: [default_____] and format:
   [default___] and ordering: [default]
