   News Brief

      New Transplantable Renal Cell Carcinoma Cell Lines
      Writing in the August 15 issue of Cancer Research, scientists at
      NCI-Frederick report that they have developed new transplantable mouse
      tumor cell lines that produce slow-growing renal cell carcinomas.
      According to the authors, these tumor cell linesgiven the acronym
      SIRCC, or streptozotocin induced renal cell carcinomashare several
      traits with the human disease, offering a unique window into the
      biology of this poorly understood disease. To read more, click here.


      New Three-Color Cytometric Assay
      In the August issue of Immunology Letters [Pubmed Abstract], scientists
      at NCI-Frederick and colleagues report on a new three-color flow
      cytometric assay to measure apoptotic cell death in vitro. According to
      the authors, "To our knowledge, the method that we are reporting here.
      . . is the only one which allows a reliable discrimination of target
      and effector cells, while at the same time providing a fine distinction
      between the two major events, early apoptosis and the increase of
      membrane permeability, which occurs during cytotoxicity."


      High Resolution Structure of IL-13 Published
      In the June 29 issue of the Journal of Molecular Biology [Pubmed
      Abstract],scientists at NCI-Frederick and colleagues report the first
      high-resolution, nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) structure of
      interleukin-13. The scientists note that the experimentally determined
      structure presented in their paper is "significantly different" from a
      previously published homology model of IL-13. They also compare the
      structure of IL-13 to the homologous IL-4, offering a starting point to
      interpret the affinities of these ILs for various receptors.


      Latest on Cyanovirin-N
      Four years ago, researchers in NCI-Fredericks Laboratory of Drug
      Discovery Research and Development and their colleagues discovered a
      small protein that irreversibly inactivates primary strains of human
      immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). But what made the finding
      particularly interesting was the scientists isolated the protein, known
      as cyanovirin-N (CV-N), from the blue-green alga Nostoc ellipsosporum.
      This marked the first antiviral protein ever isolated from a
      cyanobacterium.

      Since then, various groups have determined that CV-N stymies HIV-1, in
      part, by interacting with gp-120, a key player in binding human immune
      cells. How exactly CV-N interacts with gp-120 has been an area of
      active investigation. In three recent papers, the NCI-Frederick group
      and colleagues offer several new details that help to fill in the
      details. Read the abstracts on Pubmed using the following links:

      New V-ATPase Inhibitor
      V-ATPases are proton pumps that help to regulate myriad biological
      processes within eukaryotic cells. Though these pumps may play a role
      in many pathological conditions, including cancer, previous attempts to
      target V-ATPases therapeutically have failed because even the most
      promising compounds cannot discriminate between mammalian and
      nonmammalian V-ATPases. However, in the April issue of the Journal of
      Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics [Pubmed Abstract],
      scientists at NCI-Frederick and their collaborators report on a novel
      class of V-ATPase inhibitor that has a unique chemical structure and
      better biological specificity than previously studied V-ATPase
      inhibitors.


      Retroviruses Not So Retro
      Although research on tumor viruses in chickens led to the discovery of
      the first human oncogenes in the 1970s, work on tumor viruses has
      slowed tremendously in recent years. But in the April 10 issue of the
      Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [Pubmed Abstract],
      researchers at NCI-Frederick and their collaborators at Fred Hutchinson
      Cancer Center in Seattle report that tumor viruses still have much to
      teach us about the possible causes of human cancer.
      Working with the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), the researchers
      discovered that the gene encoding its envelope protein, or env, can
      transform rat fibroblasts in culture. This suggested that env might be
      responsible for JSRVs previously reported ability to cause a form of
      lung cancer in sheep that is quite similar to human bronchiolo-alveolar
      carcinoma. Following up on this lead, the scientists reported that env
      binds in animal cells to a receptor known as HYAL2/LUCA2. Although the
      function of HYAL2 is unknown, the scientists have identified it as a
      GPI-anchored, cell-surface protein, suggesting HYAL2 is involved in
      signal transduction and may be a tumor suppressor gene in lung cancer.


      Point Mutations and Protein Folding
      From the genome to the proteome, a major challenge now facing
      biologists is to develop a more detailed understanding of how proteins
      fold. This need becomes even more pressing as scientists begin to wade
      through the myriad single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, in the
      genome and their possible impact on protein conformation. In the March
      13 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
      scientists from NCI-Frederick and the Sackler Institute of Molecular
      Medicine in Israel report the effect of naturally occurring or
      experimentally generated point mutations on the distribution of
      conformational sub-states, by comparing mutant proteins with their wild
   types. To read about their findings, click here.
