             The President created the National Security
   Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) by Executive Order 12382
   in September 1982.  Since then, the NSTAC has served three presidents.
   Composed of up to 30 industry chief executives representing the major
   communications and network service providers and information
   technology, finance, and aerospace companies, the NSTAC provides
   industry-based advice and expertise to the President on issues and
   problems related to implementing national security and emergency
   preparedness (NS/EP) communications policy.  Since its inception, the
   NSTAC has addressed a wide range of policy and technical issues
   regarding communications, information systems, information assurance,
   critical infrastructure protection, and other NS/EP communications
   concerns.

           NS/EP communications enable the Government to make an immediate
   and coordinated response to all emergencies, whether caused by a
   natural disaster, such as a hurricane, an act of domestic terrorism,
   such as the Oklahoma City bombing, a man-made disaster, or a cyber
   attack.  NS/EP communications allow the President and other senior
   Administration officials to be continually accessible, even under
   stressed conditions.
