     A.  Electronic Commerce Working Group (ECWG) of the Justice
     Department


     The Electronic Commerce Working Group (ECWG) of the Department of
     Justice consists of lawyers from throughout the Department who are
     in regular contact to discuss legal issues related to electronic
     commerce.  The ECWG provides a convenient vehicle for Justice
     Department attorneys to disseminate information quickly regarding
     electronic commerce developments.

     The ECWG has studied complex and novel legal issues, and helps to
     coordinate Justice Department positions on emerging legal issues.
     For example, the ECWG has a sub-group that meets regularly to study
     legal issues related to electronic filing and electronic
     transactions; representatives of this subgroup have met with
     representatives of other federal agencies to discuss these issues in
     the context of a particular agencys processes.

     Commerce Working Group, please call the Department of Justices

     B. Guide for Federal Agencies on Implementing Electronic Processes


     This guide addresses legal issues that agencies are likely to face
     in converting to electronic processes and provides suggestions on
     how to address these issues.  The rise of electronic commerce offers
     departments and agencies exciting opportunities to convert or
     redesign existing processes.  At the same time, creating a more
     accessible and efficient government requires us to maintain public
     confidence in the security and reliability of the Governments
     electronic transactions, processes, and systems.  Thus, in designing
     electronic systems, departments and agencies should ensure that
     essential data are available when need and that the data and the
     underlying processes are legally sufficient, reliable and in
     compliance with all applicable legal requirements.

     scams.  On November 18, 1999, Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder
     unveiled this new tool, which describes a number of illegal schemes
     that exploit fears of the Y2K bug, and proposes ways for the public
     to respond to Y2K fraud.

     Kevin V. Di Gregory, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, testified
     before the House of Representatives Committee on Banking and
     Financial Services on June 20, 2000 on Gambling on the Internet.  As
     with earlier testimony, this statement addressed the Department of

     the problems inherent in creating a solution that is not
     technology-neutral.

     before the Subcommittee on Crime, of the House Committee on the
     Judiciary on March 9, 2000 on Internet Gambling.  His testimony
     addressed the Department of Justices concerns with proposed Internet
     gambling legislation that would effectively expand legal gambling.
     He also expressed the Departments concern with creating an
     inconsistent regulatory scheme that would result in the same conduct
     being treated differently over the telephone, the Internet, and
     other technologies.

       General, addressing Internet Gambling before the Subcommittee on

     of Justice, testified before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs
     on June 9, 1999 regarding Internet Gambling and Indian Gaming.  His
     testimony addressed two issues: (1) the Department of Justice's
     support of efforts to amend federal gambling statutes to ensure that
     these gambling activities made possible by the Internet are
     prohibited; and (2) the Department's belief that any law prohibiting
     Internet gambling should not conflict with the rights or privileges
     of Indian tribes, both as sovereigns and under the Indian Gaming
     Regulatory Act (IGRA). Also linked below is a letter from the
     Department of Justice to Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Ranking Minority
     Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, regarding the Internet Gambling

     they relate to development of the Nations policy toward gambling
     and, more particularly, the effectiveness of existing state and
     federal laws for prosecuting various forms of Internet gambling.  It
     also identifies important characteristics that legislation
     pertaining to the transmission of information over the Internet
     should have.  His testimony is available via the link below, along
     with questions and answers regarding prosecution of gambing and the

             H.   Congressional Activity on E-Signatures

   The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN)
       was enacted on June 30, 2000.   E-SIGN applies broadly to Federal
       and state statutes and regulations governing private sector
       (including business-to-business and business-to-consumer)
       activities.  The Act generally requires that agencies permit
       private parties to conduct business and retain records
       electronically, using electronic signatures.  Agencies may also
       establish appropriate performance standards for the accuracy,
       integrity, and accessibility of electronic records.  Agency
       activities and requirements that do not relate to business,
       commercial, or consumer transactions are not within the scope of
       this legislation; they are instead addressed by the Government
       Paperwork Elimination Act.  ESIGN begins to take effect on October
       1 of this year, with later dates for recordkeeping and certain
       other activities regulated by the Federal Government.  The OMB has
       issued a guidance memorandum on implementing this Act.  Any
       questions related to specific legal issues regarding this guidance
       may be referred to the Justice Department at ESIGN@usdoj.gov;
       specific questions about the legislative history of E-SIGN may be
       referred to the Commerce Department at ESIGN@doc.gov.

     legal authorities may be required for effective investigation and
