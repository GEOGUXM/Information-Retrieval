   Description of research projects:
   Current Research Projects:
   Isolation and manipulation of genes with antimicrobial activity to
   improve biocontrol of fruit pathogens
   Manipulation of genes to protect tree fruit against insects and
   diseases
   Isolation and manipulation of gene promoters to control gene expression
   in transgenic fruit trees
   Accomplishments:
   first to demonstrate that expression of malic enzyme in C3-C4
   photosynthetic plants is regulated at the level of transcript abundance
   first to suggest that proteins associated with flower induction are
   very low abundant-to-rare polypeptides
   first to isolate a receptor-like protein kinase associated with
   flowering
   first to demonstrate removal of a large, cryptic intron in a
   receptor-like protein kinase is a key component of transcript
   regulation
   first to report tissue specificity of cryptic intron processing
   first to report studies on the expression of a photosynthetic gene
   (chlorophyll a/b-binding protein) in individual fruit tree leaves under
   field conditions
   first to report isolation of a subunit of the major housekeeping
   proteolysis system (Subunit 7 of the proteosome complex) from fruit
   trees
   (Figure legend for DNA gel):
   Separation of DNA fragments in a gel matrix by electrophoresis. Marker
   fragments of known sizes were loaded into wells on either end of the
   gel as a reference. The samples were digested with a restriction
   endonuclease that yields four discrete DNA fragments, and the samples
   were loaded in the gel lanes in increasing (from left to right)
   amounts. Bands were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under
   UV light.
