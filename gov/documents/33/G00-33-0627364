                              About The FEMA Web Site

         The FEMA web site is updated 24-hours per day, 7-days per week so
          you'll always have the latest information relevant to national
      emergencies. FEMA web pages are organized into several major sections,
      each with its own main subject or homepage page. Please visit our Site
             Index to view the various sections of the FEMA Web site.

                           Which browser is best to use?

         The FEMA Web pages are best viewed using Netscape 4.0 or above or
        Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or above (for Mac) and 4.0 or above
       (for windows). You can download a browser at the Netscape site or the
                                  Microsoft site.

                            Bookmark the FEMA Homepage

                                What are Plug-ins?

        Plug-ins are software programs that extend the capabilities of web
       browsers in a specific way - giving you, for example, the ability to
       play audio samples, view video movies from within a browser and view
          documents over the Web that look just as they do when created.

                      pdf icon Portable Document Format (PDF)

      PDF is an acronym for "Portable Document Format." PDF is a file format
        created by Adobe that lets you view and print a file exactly as the
        author designed it, without needing to have the same application or
      fonts used to create the file. Since its introduction in 1993, PDF has
      become an Internet standard for electronic distribution that faithfully
        preserves the look and feel of the original document complete with
                        fonts, colors, images, and layout.

         Many documents on the FEMA web site are published using Adobe's®
       Portable Document Format (PDF). To display or print these documents,
      you must download the free Acrobat® Reader. The Acrobat® Reader allows
           you to view, navigate, and print PDF documents. Follow these
      instructions to install the Acrobat® Reader on your computer. All PDF
       documents on the FEMA Web site are characterized by the following or
      similar graphic icon ( pdf icon ). This icon is usually placed next to
      the document link. For more information, troubleshooting problems when
       downloading or installing Acrobat Reader, please visit the Adobe Web
                                       site.

                         Viewing Microsoft Word Documents

      FEMA makes wide use of Microsoft Office in it's day to day operations.
      Consequently, many documents on this web site are made available in the
      default Microsoft Office format. A common solution for viewers without
        Microsoft Office software is to acquire and use a Word Viewer, for
      viewing Microsoft Word documents. Microsoft® Word Viewer 97 for Windows
        16-bit Operating Systems (Word Viewer), is a freeware product that
      allows you to view and print Microsoft Word 97 documents. Like previous
        versions of Word Viewer, the latest version can also open documents
      created with all previous versions of Word for Windows and version 4.x
       and above of Microsoft Word for Macintosh®. You cannot edit an open
      document in Word Viewer. However, you can copy text to the Clipboard to
       paste it in other applications. Users of windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000 are
        encouraged to download the 32-bit version of the Word Viewer. This
          version of the viewer supports Word 97 and Word 2000. For more
      information, system requirements and installation instructions, please
                    visit the Word 97/2000 Viewer Support Page

                         Viewing Microsoft Excel Documents

       The Microsoft Excel 97 Viewer allows users to view and print Excel 97
         and Excel 2000 spreadsheet files, in addition to other Excel for
        Windows® (versions 2.0 and greater) and Excel for the Macintosh®
         (versions 2.2a and greater) spreadsheet files. This small, freely
       distributable viewer gives users the flexibility to view page layout,
          copy and control cell sizes, and access the zoom and AutoFilter
         features. This viewer also supports OLE DocObject as well as the
      ability to view any Excel file. This is a freeware application and can
           be downloaded from this site by clicking this link.. For more
      information, system requirements and installation instructions, please
