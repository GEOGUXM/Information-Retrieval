   Welcome to the Marine Protected Areas (MPA) Library. The purpose of the
   library is to serve those working with the nationÂ’s MPAs. Resources
   include articles and books, institutions involved in marine protected
   areas research and management, and pertinent Web sites.

   Initial Offering

   The realm of MPA literature is vast, and the task of establishing an
   MPA Library is daunting. Initial offerings from the library will focus
   on national programs and national and regional MPA systems. Web sites
   for individual marine protected areas can be found in the MPA inventory
   database (see Query the Inventory).

   The library will grow in the months and years ahead. We encourage
   contributions from the professional MPA community (Making a
   Contribution). The library is managed by staff of the Central Library
   of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

   The Collections

   The library is comprised of four collections: Reference List,
   Institutions, MPA Web Sites, and Conferences and Workshops. Each
   collection may be browsed separately, or the entire collection may be
   searched through the Virtual MPA Library.

   Notable Additions features newly released or published research of
   significance to the MPA community.

   Reference List is a list of citations to articles, books, manuals,
   research papers, reports, and proceedings on marine protected areas.

   Institutions is an annotated list of governmental and nongovernmental
   organizations involved in MPA research, analysis and management.

   MPA Web Sites is an annotated list of links to Web sites describing MPA
   programs, policy and research.
   Conferences and Workshops is a list of conferences and workshops
   focusing on the management and science of MPAs.

   Virtual MPA Library is a search engine that provides direct access to
   most of the Web sites noted in the collections.

   Making a Contribution

   The library encourages contributions (reference works, institutions,
   and Web sites) from the professional MPA community. All contributions
   will be reviewed by staff librarians. Procedures for making a
   contribution and review criteria are described in Making a
   Contribution.
