Query Language

   The following is adapted from the Microsoft Index Server Guide.

   This list gives the rules for formulating queries:
     * Multiple words are treated as a phrase; they must appear in the
       same order within a matching document.
     * You can type your query in uppercase or lowercase.
     * You can search for any word except very common words, such as (for
       English), a, an, and, as, and others.
     * Common words are treated as placeholders in phrase and proximity
       queries. For example, if you searched for Science for Dummies,
       the results could give you Science for Dummies and Science and
       Dummies, because for is considered a common word.
     * Punctuation marks such as the period (.), colon (:), semicolon (;),
       and comma (,) are ignored during a search.
     * To use specially treated characters such as &, |, ^, #, @, $, (, ),
       in a query, enclose your query in quotation marks ().
     * To search for a word or phrase containing quotation marks, enclose
       the entire phrase in quotation marks and then double the quotation
       marks around the word or words you want to surround with quotes.
       For example, World-Wide Web or Web searches for World-Wide
       Web or Web.
     * You can use Boolean Operators (AND, OR, and NOT) and the Proximity
       Operator (NEAR) to specify additional search information.
     * The Wildcard Character (*) can match words with a given prefix. The
       query esc* matches the terms ESC, escape, and so on.
