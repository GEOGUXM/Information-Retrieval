Buy Accessible

   Buy Accessible represents a partnership between government and industry
   to provide a service to federal procurement staff. It will assist
   government personnel in completing market research necessary to ensure
   that they are buying the most accessible IT products and services
   available in order to conform to Section 508.

   The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) is hosting a
   Voluntary Product Accessibility Template on their site which will allow
   vendors, who choose to participate, the ability to copy the template
   and complete it to describe how a particular product or service they
   offer conforms to Section 508 Access Board standards. This template
   should be placed on the vendors accessible web site and the link to the
   template provided to the Buy Accessible database.

   Government procurement staff will be able to search the site by
   specific product or service type and see all vendors who have provided
   links. They can then use the links to reach the template information
   and product or service descriptions necessary to complete their market
   research.

   Vendor participation is voluntary. The vendors will be maintaining
   their own information on their site. The government does not endorse or
   guarantee the accessibility of any product listed. This database is
   provided strictly to facilitate the market research and selection
   processes of Federal agencies. Federal personnel should also note that
   additional market research may be necessary as some vendors may not yet
   have updated the database with their product information. Under Section
   508 FAR guidance, due diligence is required in the conduct of market
   research and requirements development relative to Section 508
   requirements.
