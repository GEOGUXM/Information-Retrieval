   Each year, Engineering performs millions of dollars worth of research
   and development (R&D) for industry and non-Department of Energy
   governmental agencies through the application of Engineering's unique
   capabilities and the use of our special facilities and equipment.

   Engineering has been conducting unique technology-enhancing R&D for
   industry and other governmental agencies for many years as a
   complimentary extension to the Laboratory's primary DOE mission. These
   technology-enhancing capabilities are made available to industry and
   other governmental agencies through several different contractual
   mechanisms.
     * Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs)
       Engineering can collaborate with industry on mutually beneficial
       research and development through formal technology
       commercialization agreements directly negotiated between the
       industry partner and the Laboratory.
     * Work for non-Federal entity agreements
       Engineering's unique R&D resources are available to private
       industry, academia, as well as state and local governments, as long
       as the contracted work does not compete with capabilities available
       in the private sector.
     * Work for other Federal entity agreements
       Engineering's unique R&D resources are available to non-DOE
       governmental agencies on a reimbursable basis, as long as the
       contracted work does not compete with capabilities available in the
       private sector.
     * Licensing
       Engineering's Intellectual Property (IP) is available to industry
       for commercialization.
