   Join NASA and its International Partners for the latest on research and
   commercial ventures as we move into the next phase of International
   Space Station (ISS) assembly. The ISS will be a permanently orbiting
   laboratory where long-duration materials, life sciences, and commercial
   research will take place in a nearly gravity-free environment.

   International scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs are on the
   threshold of a new era of discovery. Join viewers for a world-wide,
   interactive forum to discuss the global implications of
   commercialization of the space industry. A diverse panel of top NASA,
   university and commercial researchers, international investors, and
   other experts will take your questions and comments on the air.
