   An on-line archive is kept in these WWW pages for a few days of
   analysis images. Links for these are embedded within the analysis image
   pages.

   For additional archive data, please contact Matt Nitta
   (nitta@fsl.noaa.gov) at the facility division of FSL. They may have a
   LAPS archive, though I haven't heard the present status of this.
