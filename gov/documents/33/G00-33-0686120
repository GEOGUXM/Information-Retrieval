                  Microbes in Basalt Thrive on Toxic Waste

                               By Paul Preuss

     Discovery could lead to environmentally safe cleanup of waste sites

   Seventy-five meters beneath the surface of a site in Idaho where
   high-level radioactive waste has been stored for more than 40 years,
   microorganisms living in the pores and crevices of dry basaltic rock
   are able to reduce a toxic form of chromium to a much less toxic form
   -- and they do so faster in the presence of volatile organic wastes.

   Berkeley Lab's Hoi-Ying Holman and her colleagues made the discovery by
   examining basalt core samples from beneath the Radioactive Waste
   Management Complex at the Department of Energy's Idaho National
   Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. For the first time, using
   infrared spectromicroscopy at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), the
   researchers followed the reduction of toxic metals by populations of
   live organisms on minerals.

   Moreover, says Holman, a chemist and engineer with the Earth Sciences
   Division and the Center for Environmental Biotechnology (CEB), "We have
   shown that organic vapor may accelerate the transformation of mobile,
   toxic chromium pollutants into less mobile, less toxic, stable
   compounds. This should help in the design and implementation of new,
   environmentally benign remediation techniques for cleaning up mixed
   waste sites."

   CEB's Dale Perry, Jennie Hunter-Cevera and Tamas Torok, along with
   Michael Martin, Wayne McKinney and Geraldine Lamble at the ALS, were
   among those who contributed to the discovery.

   Pick your poison

   The Idaho site is polluted with mixtures of hexavalent chromium (that's
   chromium stripped of six electrons) and other inorganic ions,
   radionuclides, petroleum hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds.
   Hexavalent chromium is carcinogenic, mutagenic, and highly toxic to
   organisms because it occurs in soluble chromates that readily cross
   cell membranes.

   Once inside a living cell these ions are reduced first to pentavalent
   chro-mium and then to trivalent chromium, which disrupts DNA
   replication. Outside the cell, however, trivalent chromium is much less
   toxic, because it is insoluble and cannot cross cell membranes.

   Deep beneath the surface, microbes live in pores in Columbia River
   basalts. As water seeps down it feeds the bugs nutrients from toxic
                                 wastes.
   "Polyvalent metal ions at this and other polluted sites are reduced on
   the surfaces of geologic materials -- that's been known for some time,"
   Holman says. "But there were two views of how this happens."

   A biological mechanism was one hypothesis. The dry Columbia River
   basalts are limited in organic carbon and other nutrients, Holman says,
   but dense clusters of microorganisms live in the pores and fractures of
   the rock.

   "When water infiltrates from rain or melting snow, a burst of nutrients
   reaches them through fissures in the rock, and they bloom like flowers
   in the desert," she says, which suggests that microbes played a role in
   the metal reduction. It was uncertain which microorganisms could be
   involved, however, and what metabolic processes were important.

   An alternate, chemical-mechanism hypothesis proposed that metal oxides
   such as iron oxides in basalt could help catalyze reductions with no
   help from living microbes.

   A bacterial champ

   To determine which mechanism was at work, Holman and her colleagues
   obtained basalt core samples from dry rock deep beneath the site. From
   these, microbiologist Tamas Torok of the Life Sciences Division
   isolated and purified 85 strains of microorganisms.

   Many were tolerant of hexavalent chromium and able to reduce it --
   especially in the presence of toluene, another of the site's
   contaminants and a common product of leaking fuel tanks. But many of
   the organisms encountered bottlenecks that slowed the reaction process.

   Finally, one strain of bacteria --Arthrobacter oxydans -- emerged as
   champion.

   But since A. oxydans tends to concentrate in areas rich in magnetite
   (an iron-oxide compound common in basalt), the researchers had to
   eliminate the possibility that the magnetite itself was responsible for
   the reduction.

   They performed a series of tests to see if reactions would proceed
   under realistic environmental conditions: in an aerobic atmosphere, at
   room temperature, and in the dark.

   For five days, working at the ALS's infrared beamline 1.4.3, the
   researchers observed the steps involved in the reduction process and
   the precise location of reduced chromium.

   Surprising light

   "The infrared is the end of the spectrum not usually associated with
   synchrotrons," says Holman, "but for us it's perfect. ... We could
   resolve the spectrum in time, to follow the different steps of the
   reduction, and also in space, to see exactly where the reactions were
   happening."

   On the samples with no living bacteria, no changes were evident; even
   on samples with living A. oxydans, in the absence of toluene chromium
   reduction was weak. But where A. oxydans had been exposed to toluene,
   infrared spectromicroscopy showed that hexavalent chromium was reduced
   and toluene was degraded -- right where the bacteria were concentrated.

   To find out if the same thing happen in nature -- that is, at the waste
   site -- "we now needed to study natural communities in the basalt,"
   says Holman.

   With the help of Andre Mei, a machinist in the Technical Services
   Department, she devised a unique diamond saw that could cut thin slices
   from fresh basalt cores -- slowly, at cool temperatures (the only
   pressure is the core's own counterbalanced weight against the cutting
   wire), and under aseptic conditions.

   Over a period of four months the slices of native rock, with their
   resident communities of microbes still in place, were exposed to
   solutions of hexavalent chromium and toluene vapor. At first, infrared
   spectromicroscopy showed no evidence of reduction, and it appeared that
   many of the organisms were dying. But after four months,
   chromium-tolerant and chromium-reducing natural microorganisms were
   seen to be thriving -- in association with trivalent chromium.

   Says Holman, "As far as we know, this is the first time that infrared
   synchrotron studies have been used to follow the steps in the
   transformation of toxic chromium on mineral surfaces."
