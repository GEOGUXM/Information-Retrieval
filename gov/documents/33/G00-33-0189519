     SBA ANNOUNCES LLOYD A. BLANCHARD AS ITS NEW CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER

   WASHINGTON –
       The U.S. Small Business Administration announced today the
       appointment of Lloyd A. Blanchard, Ph.D, as its new chief operating
       officer. In his capacity as COO, Dr. Blanchard will oversee SBA’s
       daily operations nationwide.
       "The agency will greatly benefit from Dr. Blanchard’s managerial
       experience and administrative skills, as well as from the depth and
       breadth of his contacts within the government, business and
       academic communities," said SBA Administrator Hector V. Barreto
       upon announcing Dr. Blanchard’s appointment. "His accomplishments
       as both a scholar and public servant will be an asset to the SBA
       and will strengthen our managerial team."
       "I am thankful for the appointment and I welcome the opportunity to
       contribute in any way I can to further the SBA’s mission of
       promoting the growth and strengthening of America’s small
       businesses, which is, after all, where America works," said Dr.
       Blanchard. I look forward to working with Administrator Barreto,
       his staff and the rest of the SBA’s employees nationwide to
       streamline the agency operations and make it even more effective."
       As COO, Dr. Blanchard will be responsible for implementing
       President Bush’s agenda for small businesses. He will have policy
       review authority for the SBA and will be responsible for overseeing
       the budgetary aspects of the agency operations.
       Dr. Blanchard is an award-winning scholar who served as a Program
       Associate Director for the Office of Management and Budget before
       joining the SBA. While at OMB, Dr. Blanchard led the General
       Government Resource Management Office, which included managerial
       and budgetary oversight responsibilities for the SBA, as well as
       the departments of Transportation, Justice, Commerce, Housing and
       Urban Development and the General Services Administration.
       Before joining the Bush Administration he was on the faculty of the
       Daniel J. Evans School of Public Affairs at the University of
       Washington. In 1999 he earned a Ph.D in public administration from
       Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public
       Affairs with a concentration in public finance and urban policy.
