   Office of the Chief Information Officer

   Welcome to the Chief Information Office's website!

   OCIO develops technological strategies and solutions that enable the
   Department of Education (ED) to provide world-class service to schools,
   students and their families. Our efforts help:
     * level the playing field so disabled people throughout the nation
       can contribute to society;
     * create revolutionary systems that allow the states to send ED data
       only once-instead of time after time;
     * ensure that ED employees can serve the schools and students more
       efficiently;
     * protect the valuable information stored on ED's systems;
     * revolutionize ED's business processes in partnership with ED
       offices; and
     * save ED millions of dollars.

   Through technology, we hope to remove all barriers to learning so that
   no child is left behind.
