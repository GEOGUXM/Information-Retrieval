   OOF: Object-Oriented Finite Element Analysis of Real Material
   Microstructures

   A micrograph of a thermal barrier coating Materials assigned in ppm2oof

   Start with a micrograph...

   ... select features in the image and assign material properties to
   them...
   schematic of a virtual experiment image of stresses in the thermal
   barrier coating

   ... then perform a virtual experiment...

   ... and measure and visualize the internal stresses.

   Background

   OOF is designed to help materials scientists calculate macroscopic
   properties from images of real or simulated microstructures. It is
   composed of two cooperating parts: ppm2oof and oof. ppm2oof reads
   images in the ppm (Portable Pixel Map) format and assigns material
   properties to features in the image. oof conducts virtual experiments
   on the data structures created by ppm2oof to determine the macroscopic
   properties of the microstructure. Currently, the programs calculate
   stresses and strains, but someday we hope to include thermal, electric,
   and magnetic field calculations.

   The programs are written in C++ and benefit from an object-oriented
   design. The underlying numerical solutions rely on finite element
   technology. Hence the name OOF, for object-oriented finite element
   analysis.

   There are now two separate versions of OOF available. The original
   version solves elasticity problems. The new thermal version solves
   elasticity and thermal diffusion problems. Compiled executables and
   source code are available on the download page.

   A program to convert OOF data files to ABAQUS input files is now
   available on the OOF2ABAQUS page.

   Industry Week logo

   OOF was named one of the top 25 Technologies of the Year by Industry
   Week magazine in December 1999.
