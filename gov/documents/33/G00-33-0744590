                               Acknowledgments

   A report like this can only result from the contributions of many
   people. First, I must thank the men and women of the National Oceanic
   and Atmospheric Administration and National Weather Service who
   provided the needed data and information and responded to our numerous
   requests for additional information and answers to questions. Next, the
   Department of Commerce provided me with a team of experts-John Dutton,
   Craig Dorman, Al Kaehn and David McMillian - each provided wise
   counsel, useful information and helped get the requisite analyses
   accomplished. Third, Bob Winokur, Acting Director, NWS and Captain Don
   Winter insured we received the necessary information and helped us
   determine locations to visit. Fourth, the MITRE cost analyst team of
   Robert Abramson, Julia Taylor, Thomas Troiano and Steve Welman, who
   brought order, insight and meaning to large reams of numbers.

   My deepest appreciation goes to the government team - Susan Sutherland,
   Gary Knebel, Paul Nipko, Greg Mandt and Diana Abney - who assisted in
   accomplishing this study. This report would not have been done without
   their hard work, intellectual acuity and persistent efforts.

   While I appreciate the inputs and advice from each contributor, this
   was not a committee effort; the final recommendations and funding
   decisions are solely the author's.

                        SECTION I - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

   During the past several months serious questions have arisen within the
   DOC and NOAA concerning the fiscal and people resources required by the
   NWS to continue to provide regular operations and maintain current
   modernization program schedules. These concerns resulted in the
   commissioning of this study to ascertain appropriate resources needed
   to operate the NWS.

   A preliminary budget analysis was conducted to assess the
   reasonableness and underlying rational for the FY 1998 and 1999 NWS
   budgets. The results of this analysis are presented within appropriate
   sections of this report.

   The NWS budget structure is complex with fiscal resources budgeted,
   appropriated and expended in multiple accounts: a BASE account and five
   modernization accounts. Within the modernization accounts, budget
   categories are clearly defined and activities identified and costed.
   Fiscal resources in the FY 1998 President's Budget and the FY 1999 OMB
   submit were discernible and our approach involved evaluating the
   reasonableness of the activity, its associated cost and making
   appropriate adjustments. This was not the case with the BASE account.
   Traditionally, NWS, like many government agencies, does not apportion
   BASE dollars into component parts and activities. Thus, identifying
   what activities and categories are included and how labor and non-labor
   costs were allocated within the FY 1998 and 1999 budgets was
   impossible. Our approach was to develop for both labor and non-labor
   the level of resources NWS needs to provide required levels of products
   and services and maintain a supporting infrastructure. We accomplished
   this by visiting NWS units, meeting with customers, receiving briefings
   and holding discussions with DOC, NOAA and NWS staffs, analyzing
   pertinent budget data including NWS' newly developed Zero Base Budget
   and considering comparable industry norms.

   Overall, the NWS FY 1998 budget projections to support modernization
   activities appear reasonable. We decreased funding ($2.9 million) for
   acquisition management activities and communication circuits. In FY
   1999, projected operations and maintenance costs for the NEXRAD program
   appeared high when considered within the context of our recommended
   increase to base. We decreased funding ($7.0 million). Remaining
   funding will enable NWS to maintain a healthy and sustainable NEXRAD
   O&M program to include Preventative Maintenance Inspections, procuring
   spares, initiating a modification program and continuing system
   evolution efforts. We also reduced funding ($1.0 million) for
   communication circuits and acquisition management activities. In both
   years, we increased funding for facilities maintenance ($500,000).

   Our analysis of the BASE budget indicates both the FY 1998 President's
   Budget and FY 1999 OMB Submit under-fund labor and non-labor
   inflationary costs and do not provide sufficient resources to maintain
   required field (i.e., Weather Forecast Offices) staffing levels. The
   labor shortfall is particularly acute in FY 1999, which would have
   reduced field office staffing by approximately 200 positions below the
   recommended level of 3600 FTE. Delays in the AWIPS delivery schedule
   necessitate corresponding delays in the planned drawdown of field
   office staff. We included additional funding in both years.

   We noted funding for several NWS-wide programs (e.g., GOES-Tap,
   Cooperative Institute program) was fragmented into different offices
   with no one office assigned overall responsibility; we consolidated
   funding for these programs. We discovered instances where funds for a
   program were allocated to one office, but implementation responsibility
   was assigned to a different office; we consolidated funding in the
   implementation office.

   In FY 1997, NWS streamlined staffing levels allocated to the regional
   headquarters infrastructure (292 to 235). We saw no evidence to
   indicate these reduced levels are not adequate. As part of this
   streamlining, NWS decided to close the Southern Region Headquarters
   (SRH) and downgrade the Alaska and Pacific Regions. This latter action
   has been tabled. During our review we noted the NWS Regional Directors
   had developed a plan to maintain the SRH within the 235 person ceiling.
   An analysis of this proposal vis-à-vis NWS' showed it to be
   operationally and managerially superior. From a resource perspective,
   it is only marginally more expensive. We recommend the Regional
   Directors' plan be adopted and plans to close the SRH be terminated.

   We ascertained the field office staffing model used to allocate labor
   resources in the modernized NWS is reasonable. The model is predicated
   on AWIPS and its associated productivity tools meeting design
   specifications. Our analysis indicates NWS development efforts are on
   track; when the systems are fielded and the subsequent restructuring
   completed, NWS should be able to meet programmed staffing levels.

   AWIPS like many large information technology programs has experienced
   technical difficulties, cost growth and schedule delays. Our review
   indicates the program is making progress. All field personnel who have
   used the current software release (Build 3) are complimentary about its
   utility and functionality. We noted several areas (program management
   structure and approach, system engineering) that require attention and
   provided recommendations to improve the overall management of this
   critical program.

   Since the required analysis was needed in a comparatively short period
   of time (less than 90 days), we could not analyze in detail all
   relevant issues raised by the proposed budgets. Instead, we identified
   those issues and uncertainties that require more complete analysis and
   highlight their significance so they can be more fully examined by DOC,
   NOAA, and NWS. Additionally, we indicate several service activities
   that should be reviewed to determine if they can be more economically
   and efficiently provided by other than a government work force. We
   provided (Section XII) a number of recommendations to improve NOAA and
   NWS planning, budget analysis and evaluation, program prioritization,
   cost identification and control, requirements definition and approval,
   management and decision-making processes.
