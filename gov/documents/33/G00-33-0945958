                  El Nino Challenges Mountain Hydrographers

                             by Gerald Rockwell

   The 1998 El Nino has created unique challenges for hydrographers
   (people who measure water) in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Lowland
   areas have received many inches of rain, while the mountains received
   many feet of snow. Preliminary data from the April 1, 1998, snow survey
   indicate annual precipitation to be approximately 138 percent of
   average.

   When descending into Sierra Nevada streams to make streamflow
   measurements, hydrographers often use a climbing rope. Actually the
   descent isn't a problem. Gravity will do its work whether you want it
   to or not, but the ascent requires a rope (fig. 1).

   Throughout the Sierra Nevada, many stream gages often are buried
   beneath 10 to 15 feet of snow. This snow has to be removed just to
   enter the gage house (fig. 2). In March 1998, I flew in by helicopter
   to measure flow at the North Fork Stanislaus River gages. Most gage
   houses were completely buried, so we circled in the helicopter until we
   could see the sun's reflection from the solar panels, which are 20 feet
   above the ground but were only a few feet above the snow.

   One of the basic principles of monitoring streamflow is the relation
   between gage height (stage or elevation of the water's surface above a
   known point) and streamflow. During the year, a hydrographer makes many
   streamflow measurements. From these measurements, a graphic relation is
   developed between gage height and streamflow (fig. 3). Often, an
   instrument is set up to record the gage height. The mean daily
   discharge, in cubic feet per second, can be computed from the records.

   El Nino has played havoc with these computations in many different
   ways. In the lowlands, floods scour and fill the channel, which can
   alter the gage height/streamflow relation. In the Sierra Nevada, this
   relation may change hourly if ice and snow block the channel (fig. 4).
   This year, I've seen more gage-height records affected by ice than in
   the past 20 years as a hydrographer in the Sierra Nevada.

   When it rains in the mountains, and the snow begins to melt as in March
   1998, the creeks start to rise. Even if the creeks don't rise to flood
   level, many extra discharge measurements are needed. These extra
   measurements are generally made toward the end of the storm, as cold
   air moves in behind the front, and it starts to snow. Quite often, I
   watch the snow build up on the arm holding the wading rod as I struggle
   to stand in 3 feet of fast-moving, zero-degree C water with 100-pound
   blocks of ice speeding toward me... I must say it's quite
   stimulating!!!
