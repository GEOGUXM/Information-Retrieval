  Overview
     __________________________________________________________________

   We (1) study the structure of globular protein molecules and the forces
   that determine the structure, stability, and interaction of these
   molecules, (2) design mutations that will alter/improve properties of a
   class of anti-cancer immunotoxins and of other specific protein
   molecules and (3) analyze the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) DNA sequence
   database to discover genes that are specifically expressed in a
   particular organ or tumor. The product of such genes can potentially be
   used as a target for delivery of antitumor agents and for tumor
   imaging.

   Following is a more specific description of the current research
   projects and results: (1) We found by a theoretical analysis of the
   hydration thermodynamics of aromatic compounds that the substantial
   solubility of these compounds in water is due to the strong van der
   Waals interaction between water and the aromatics rings. The
   hydrophobic and hydrophilic dual character of these molecules explains
   the abundance of aromatic amino acids in membrane proteins at
   water-membrane interface and in globular proteins at protein-protein
   interface. (2) Two new protein conformational search procedures have
   been designed for use in ab initio protein structure prediction. One
   method was used to discover a couple of serious defects in the
   statistical "threading potential" when it is used in an ab initio
   folding process. The second combines a novel fast local move in the
   dihedral angle space, a "window growth" procedure, and an evolutionary
   algorithm. We are currently developing a potential function that will
   go with this latter search procedure. (3) We designed two protein
   structure comparison procedures, one for the global and the other for
   the local comparisons. We used the former procedure to automatically
   cluster all protein structures. We are currently using the second to
   find domains and to develop a new set of "threading potential". (4) In
   collaboration with the Molecular Biology Section, we developed
   procedures for identifying mutation sites that, when altered, will
   increase the stability or reduce the non-specific toxicity of
   immunotoxins. The procedures have been successfully tested
   experimentally on several specific immunotoxin species. (5) We
   developed a new procedure for clustering EST sequences that take full
   advantage of the draft human genome sequence. We also developed a local
   genome browser that is patterned after the "Golden Path" browser of Jim
   Kent at UCSD and which is particularly convenient for spotting
   organ-specific EST clusters. We expect to be able to find new prostate
   and breast specific genes more easily using these tools.
