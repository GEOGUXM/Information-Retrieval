                                 Who We Are

          Welcome to Goddard CFO Web Page
                Welcome to the Chief Financial Officer's (CFO) Home Page
                at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The Office of the CFO
                provides leadership in the development, implementation,
                and administration of Goddard's system of resources
                management and financial control. The Office of the CFO is
                the central focal point through which Center-level
                financial management and resources decisions are developed
                and executed. The Office of the CFO directs and
                coordinates all budget development and execution activity.
                The Office is also responsible for designing and
                implementing the financial systems required for proper
                data collection and reporting.
