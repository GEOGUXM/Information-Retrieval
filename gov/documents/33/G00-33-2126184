     On July 6, 1962, NASA selected White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) as
     the site for the Johnson Space Center (JSC) Propulsion Systems
     Development Facility. This site was chosen for its isolated location
     and topography, which minimized the inherent hazards of aerospace
     propulsion testing to the general population. WSTF began testing
     rocket engines in 1964.  More than 310 engines have been tested, for
     a total number of firings exceeding 2.1 million.
