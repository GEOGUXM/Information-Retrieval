                        NOAA Ship DAVID STARR JORDAN
     __________________________________________________________________

   The DAVID STARR JORDAN was built in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin in 1964 and
   commissioned in San Diego, CA, in 1966. The ship was designed and built
   for the U.S. Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, which later became part of
   the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for the purpose of
   fisheries research in the tropical Pacific. Since commissioning, the
   DAVID STARR JORDAN has logged over a million miles while studying the
   biological and physical oceanography of the southwestern U.S. coast and
   the eastern tropical Pacific. The DAVID STARR JORDAN is a participant
   in the Stenella Abundance Research Project (STAR), a 3-year study
   designed to assess the status of dolphin stocks which have been taken
   as incidental catch by the yellowfin tuna purse-seine fishery in the
   eastern tropical Pacific. The vessel is operated by the Office of
   Marine and Aviation Operations.

   David Starr Jordan The ship is named after Dr. David Starr Jordan
   (1851-1931). Dr. Jordan was one of the best known naturalists and
   educators of his time. He wrote more than 50 books and published over
   600 scientific papers on topics ranging from ichthyology (the branch of
   zoology dealing with fish) to advancing world peace. In 1879, at the
   age 34, Dr. Jordan became president of Indiana University. In 1891, he
   was selected as the first president of Stanford University, a post he
   held for 25 years. Dr. Jordan was a member of the California State Fish
   Commission, and his investigations of the exploitation of the salmon
   and fur seal populations helped save these species.
