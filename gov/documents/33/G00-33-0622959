Highway to Space

   Marshall is NASA's lead center for developing the nation's future
   reuseable space transportation systems. Marshall is leading the way to
   unlocking the potential of space by improving the safety, reliability,
   and reducing the cost of getting to space.

   The people of MSFC oversee NASA's exciting technology development and
   demonstation programs and develop the propulsion systems needed for
   NASA's science missions and the International Space Station.
   Demonstrating advanced technologies in experimental aircrafts are
   setting the stage for dramatic improvements in future launch vehicles.
   MSFC is also looking 25-40 years into the future, developing
   breakthroughs that will lead to systems we can only imagine of today.

   Marshall is also responsible for the most critical components of
   today's launch vehicle workhorse the Space Shuttle, including the
   shuttle main engines, solid rocket boosters and external fuel tank. And
   when spacecraft need an extra boost into high-Earth orbit or on escape
   routes for planetary missions, they're likely to ride on
   Marshall-managed spacecraft boosters. As NASA's center of excellence
   for space propulsion, Marshall employs some of the nation's finest and
   brightest engineers to support its renowned propulsion programs.
