   Awareness, Training, and Education


   Public Law 100-235 titled, "The Computer Security Act of 1987,"
   mandated NIST and OPM to create guidance on computer security Awareness
   and Training based on functional organizational roles.  Guidance was
   produced in the form of a NIST Special Publication 800-16 titled,
   "Information Technology Security Training Requirements: A Role- and
   Performance-Based Model."  The learning continuum modeled in this
   guidance, provides the relationship between awareness, training, and
   education.


   Awareness

   ...to focus attention on security


   Training

   ...to produce relevant and needed security skills and competency


   Education

   ...to integrate all (security skills and competencies) into a common
   body of knowledge, adding a multidisciplinary study of concepts,
   issues, and principles


   Professional Development (Organizations and Certifications)

   ...imply a guarantee as meeting a standard by applying evaluation or
   measurement criteria
