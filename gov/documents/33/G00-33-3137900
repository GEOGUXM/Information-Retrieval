          1999 Academic Performance Reported For California Schools

   SACRAMENTO -- Today marks a significant milestone on the path to the
   creation of a comprehensive accountability system for California public
   schools, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin said
   as she released the 1999 Academic Performance Index (API) reports for
   public schools throughout the state.

             She continued, Ever since I was first elected as State
   Superintendent, I have been strongly committed to developing a system
   that sets high academic standards, monitors the progress of schools
   toward achieving those standards, and provides the support schools need
   to ensure success.  We are making great strides toward fulfilling that
   commitment.

             The API is the cornerstone of the Public Schools
   Accountability Act (PSAA-- Senate Bill 1X), a Governor Gray
   Davis-sponsored bill, signed into law in April 1999.  This law
   authorized the establishment of the first statewide accountability
   system for California public schools.  The system includes three major
   components: the API, the Immediate Intervention/Underperforming Schools
   Program (II/USP), and the Governors Performance Award Program (GPAP).

             The Governor and State Senator Dede Alpert are to be
   commended for their contribution to this important step in ensuring
   Californias schools focus, like a laser, on academic achievement, said
   Eastin.  I also want to commend the members of the PSAA Advisory
   Committee and the staff at the California Department of Education for
   making this dream a reality in such a short time.

             The purpose of the API is to measure the academic performance
   and progress of schools.  It is a numeric index that ranges from a low
   of 200 to a high of 1000. The 1999 API establishes the baseline for a
   schools academic performance and sets annual targets for growth.  The
   state has set 800 as the API score that schools should strive to meet.

             Eastin noted that the statewide target of 800, adopted by the
   State Board of Education in November 1999, represents a high level of
   student performance, attained by approximately 12 percent of schools.
   She said, The 1999 API results should be seen as a starting point for
   our schools.  The statewide target establishes where we want all
   schools to be.  Whats important is that, wherever schools are on the
   API scale, they can and must show academic progress.  This improvement
   in student achievement is the goal of our accountability system.

             The statewide median elementary school API score is 629.  The
   median middle school API score is 633; and the median high school API
   score is 620.  The median means that one half of the schools are at or
   above that number, and half are below.

             The API Internet reports for schools will be posted on the
   California Department of Education Web site at
   http://www.cde.ca.gov/psaa on January 25 at 10 a.m.

             Results of the Stanford 9 test, given in spring 1999 as part
   of the states Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) program, were
   used to calculate the schools API for 1999.  In grades 28, the API
   measures student performance in mathematics, reading, language, and
   spelling.  In grades 911, the API measures performance in mathematics,
   reading, language, history-social science, and science.

             Most, but not all, schools are included in the system of API
   ranking and growth targets.  The API and annual growth targets are
   calculated for elementary, middle, and comprehensive high schools that
   have 100 or more valid student test scores from the states STAR
   program.  Schools with fewer than 100 valid scores, along with
   alternative schools, continuation high schools, and county-administered
   schools, will participate in an alternative accountability system to be
   developed by July 1, 2000.

             The 1999 API reports posted today feature two types of
   rankings for schools. First, schools receive an API score between 200
   and 1000, and these scores are ranked statewide in ten groups of equal
   size (deciles) from one (lowest) to ten (highest).  Schools are
   separated by school category (elementary, middle, and high) and then
   ranked within category.  A second decile ranking (also from one to ten)
   compares each schools 1999 API scores to other schools with similar
   characteristics.

             Each schools 1999 API report includes the 19992000 growth
   target and the target score for the year 2000.  A schools annual growth
   target is five percent of the distance between the 1999 API and the
   statewide performance target of 800.

             In addition to rankings and targets for the schools as a
   whole, API scores and growth targets are reported for ethnic and
   socio-economically disadvantaged student subgroups within the school
   with large enough numbers to be significant.

             The accountability system, which requires growth by all
   numerically significant subgroups, makes a strong statement that the
   achievement of all students in a school is important, Eastin said.  No
   student should be left behind.

             Schools must annually report their API rankings in their
   local School Accountability Report Cards starting in July 2000.  Each
   school districts governing board must discuss these results at a
   regularly scheduled meeting.

             The 2000 API reports are scheduled to be released next fall.
   These reports will provide new API scores for each school, based on the
   spring 2000 Stanford 9 results.  The reports will show how well schools
   and their subgroups have achieved their targets, based on growth from
   the 1999 API.

             Schools that meet their school-wide and student subgroup
   growth targets will be eligible for cash or other types of awards from
   the state through the Governors Performance Award Program (GPAP).
   Schools that do not meet their targets may be eligible for
   interventions or ultimately state sanctions through the Immediate
   Intervention/Underperforming Schools Program (II/USP).

             Close to $200 million was allocated in 19992000 for the PSAAs
   interventions and awards programs.  An additional $50 million was
   allocated for the Certificated Staff Performance Incentive Act
   (Assembly Bill 1114), enacted in June 1999, which provides performance
   bonuses to teachers and other certificated staff in underachieving
   schools that significantly improve beyond their annual API growth
   target.

             The California Department of Education (CDE) plans to add
   other indicators of a schools academic performance to the API as soon
   as they are available.  These indicators could include results of the
   augmented STAR test that is aligned to state-adopted content standards,
   once the results are valid and reliable; a high school exit exam that
   is currently under development; and graduation and attendance rates.
   The law requires that test results make up at least 60 percent of the
   API.

             We will add other data to the API when we feel confident that
   the information used is accurate, valid, and reliable, Eastin said.

             Eastin convened a PSAA Advisory Committee of educators and
   business leaders last year to oversee the development of all components
   of the PSAA, including the API.  A subcommittee of that group worked
   with researchers and technical experts from universities and K12
   education to create the 1999 API.  A PSAA subcommittee on awards was
   convened in January 2000 to develop recommendations for procedures and
   eligibility criteria for the GPAP and Assembly Bill 1114.

             Media questions about the 1999 API results should be directed
   to CDEs Office of Policy and Evaluation at (916) 657-2757.  The web
   site http://www.cde.ca.gov/psaa also has additional explanatory
   materials about the API, including how the numbers are calculated.
