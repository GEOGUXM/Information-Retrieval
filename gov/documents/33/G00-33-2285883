                 Searching publication lists and bibliographies is generally done using
      a browser scroll bar or by navigational anchors (date, alphabet,
   number, etc.).  However, while in one of our publication lists, hitting
   "Ctrl F" from your keyboard will open a small search window.  Entering
    any information (name, year, terminology, etc.), will take you to the
    first occurrence of that query within the page.  This method works on
               both Microsoft Explorer and Netscape browsers.
