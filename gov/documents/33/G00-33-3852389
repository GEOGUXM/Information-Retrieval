   charged-particle spectrometer capable of measuring and resolving the
   velocity distribution of electrons and ions and the mass composition of
   ions that make up the wide variety of plasmas found in the solar
   system. In order to coincide with the scientific objectives of the DS1
   mission, the particular design chosen for PEPE focuses on measuring
   solar-wind plasma and the plasma populations resulting from solar-wind
   interactions with intrinsic plasmas associated with the outgassing of
   asteroids and comets. However, the general concepts and technologies
   used in PEPE can be adapted readily to a wider Figure 1. Photo of PEPE
   on the Bench Prior to variety of objectives and missions, in particular
   missions to Delivery study planetary magnetospheres. A major driving
   factor in the design of PEPE was to reduce its resource requirements
   PEPE required a number of breakthroughs: a complete relative to those
   of instruments with comparable redesign of the CAPS particle -optics
   system, new ways of capabilities. In this case, we turned to the
   Cassini Plasma miniaturizing and incorporating the large number of high
   Spectrometer, a very high capability instrument presently voltages
   required to drive the optics, and miniaturization of operating on the
   Cassini-Orbiter spacecraft. Because the critical circuits needed for

   are the same, the flight (TOF) measurements and for data acquisition
   and goals for the PEPE design consisted of trying to duplicate
   compression. Fortunately, the radiation hardness required of the main
   performance features of the Cassini instrument in a the DS1 program did
   not place any stringent requirements much lower resource instrument. It
   was recognized at the on the PEPE electronic-parts procurements. We
