   NHD Data Maintenance
   Feeling Cooperative?
   It's up to you. The NHD truly is a cooperative product. Active users of
   the data are expected to be contributors as well. As you work with the
   data, please track your additions and improvements so that you can send
   them back to become part of the NHD. We intend to begin accepting
   user-supplied updates to NHD data only after it has been through the
   flow validation process.
   The NHD has been designed to identify, accept, and track updates, but
   the policies and procedures to do this are not fully developed. We need
   NHD users to help us evolve policies and procedures that will be usable
   and beneficial to both updaters and the national database maintainers.
   Obviously, this dynamic process of growth must conform to certain
   conventions. The NHD has been designed with specific methods for
   adding, deleting, or correcting data. Some of these methods may be
   unfamiliar at first, but they are reasonably straightforward, and
   necessary to safeguard the integrity of the data for all users.
   Some changes can have significant impacts. Stream classification, for
   example, can affect natural resource management, flood hazard risk,
   development, storm water management, water rights, etc. It is essential
   that any changes made to the NHD are valid. Users expect the data to be
   valid, and the NHD is depending on users to help identify policies and
   procedures that assure reliability and validity as well as to add to
   and improve the data. These policies and procedures will take time to
   develop.
   In the meantime, we have developed initial procedures to accept updates
   to names. We can process updates to names, because names can be
   verified against an authoritative source, the Geographic Names
   Information System (GNIS). A special extract from GNIS is prepared that
   contains the name and associated GNIS_ID (among other items) for only
   hydrographic features. This extract is formatted into GIS coverages for
   updaters to validate names before they are submitted for incorporation
   into the NHD.
   Initially, the NHD will accept updates by receiving an entire NHD
   coverage of the updated area from the updater. The coverage should
   contain the updates, a list of the changed features (in the status
   table), and metadata that describes what was done to update the
   coverage. The central update software will extract the updates from the
   coverage using the status table, perform validation, and apply the
   changes to the NHD database. A long term maintenance objective is to
   simply receive transactions from updaters. But for now, whole coverages
   will be the method of exchanging updates.
   A tutorial is being developed that will provide step-by-step
   instructions on how to verify that the name and GNIS_ID are valid, how
   to edit the actual data, and how to build the 'status' table that will
   identify which feature was edited and the type of edits.
   It is difficult to estimate how quickly we will be able to respond
   because no one knows how many changes will be submitted. We also do not
   yet have the tools that will make it easier for a user to capture their
   changes during the normal course of working with the data. We hope to
   develop those in cooperation with the user community. When people
   actively use the data and discover shortcomings, this real world
   experience will help us develop the tools, policies, and procedures
   needed to maintain the NHD.
