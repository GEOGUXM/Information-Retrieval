   Climate analysis is an essential component of natural resource
   assessment evaluations.   Many natural resources depend on climatic
   inputs and variables.  This is especially true of agricultural
   resources, ecosystem resources, water resources, and renewable energy
   resources.

   This component of our research will focus on using climatic simulations
   and models in combination with remote sensing and geographic data to
   provide a characterization of climate with high spacial and temporal
   resolution.  We will first focus on temperature and atmospheric heat
   transport models, progressing to wind and air motion models.  We will
   compare these models with available remote sensing data.  And finally
   we will  progress to more complicated water vapor transport models that
   can be applied to mapping of humidity and rainfall distributions.

   The U.S. and Africa  have been selected as the focal areas for this
   research. The U.S. has been chosen as that area where a tremendous
   amount of data and resources exist for forecasts and analyses.  Because
   of the data-rich environment, studies using U.S. case material allow
   for the detailed theoretical validation of methodologies.  Meanwhile
   Africa as that continent with the fewest information resources, and a
   rapidly growing population of over 800 million, has the greatest need
   for inexpensive analysis methods that can be used with a minimum of
   data.  These two study areas represent the extremes in terms of both
   institutional resources and needs.
