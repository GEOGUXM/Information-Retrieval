     __________________________________________________________________

   Those interested in obtaining training in access management should
   consider the following course offered by the National Highway Institute
   (NHI). An electronic copy of the course materials have been included in
   the Access Management CD Library.

     NHI COURSE NUMBER: 15255

     COURSE TITLE: Access Management, Location and Design

     LENGTH: 3 Days (CEU: 1.8 Units)

     CLASS SIZE: 40 maximum

   DESCRIPTION:
          This course provides a comprehensive and detailed discussion of
          access management along our streets and highways. The course has
          been extensively revised and now includes material from the
          newly released NCHRP report entitled, "Access Management
          Guidelines for Activity Centers" and the 1993 National
          Conference on Access Management.

          The general benefits as well as the social, economic, political
          and legal implications of access control are examined in detail.
          Existing access management practices and policies from sample
          States and jurisdictions are presented as examples of what types
          of programs have been initiated and how effective they have
          been. At the heart of the course, is an in-depth discussion of
          management techniques and the warrants for their use. Geometric
          standards and guidelines for design and application of these
          management techniques are described in detail. Also presented
          are strategies for developing and implementing retrofit programs
          to improve existing access control. Several "before" and 'after"
          case studies showing the impacts of retrofit programs on local
          businesses are provided. A significant portion of the course
          covers techniques and procedures for evaluating the impacts of
          access control on the safety and operations of the highway
          system.

   OBJECTIVES:
          Upon completion of the course the participants should be able
          to:

          + Recognize the various elements involved in planning,
            developing, implementing and administering an effective access
            management program.
          + Assess the safety and operational impacts of alternative
            access management techniques.
          + Demonstrate convincingly the merits of obtaining and
            maintaining good access management along our streets and
            highways.
       _______________________________________________________________

     This course is designed for Federal, State, and local planners and
     engineers who are currently involved or expect to be involved in
     decisions on and/or design of access to existing sites or new
     development.

     management and have published a number of books and papers on the
     subject.

     State and local agencies that are considering access management
     strategies, policies and programs or already have programs in place
     should consider sponsoring the course as a means to enhance the
     understanding and expertise of access management within their
     respective jurisdictions.

     Individuals interested in attending a presentation of Access
     Management, Location and Design should send an expression of
     interest to Mr. Ron Giguere via e-mail
     (ron.giguere@igate.fhwa.dot.gov) or fax (202-366-7909). Attempts
     will be made to place these individuals into any openings that may
     exist in scheduled courses or future courses on a first come-first
     served basis.
