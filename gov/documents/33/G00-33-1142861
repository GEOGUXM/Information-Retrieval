                 CRAPO CO-SPONSORS TAX CREDIT FOR HOMEBUYERS

                   Bill aims to stimulate sagging economy


   Washington, DC - Idaho Senator Mike Crapo wants first-time homebuyers
   to have an opportunity to stimulate the domestic economy, and has
   agreed to co-sponsor legislation that would provide them with a tax
   credit. S. 1396 is also expected to provide stimulus to a wide variety
   of retail industries, such as furniture, lumber, paint, carpet, and
   appliances, as well as professional services from financial
   institutions, attorneys, architects, landscapers, and transportation
   systems.

   "This credit would provide economic stimulus on so many fronts in the
   State of Idaho," Crapo said. "None of us could have foreseen the tragic
   events of September 11 or anticipated the effects of such a catastrophe
   on our nation's economy. This is one of several bills that have the
   potential to provide a boost to our sagging economy. My colleagues in
   Congress and I will continue to work on a comprehensive economic
   stimulus plan, but this particular tax credit is a step in the right
   direction to providing immediate relief to homebuyers and homebuilders
   in Idaho and across the country."

   The bill, introduced by Senators Kent Conrad (D-North Dakota) and Tim
   Hutchinson (R-Arkansas), intends to provide for a one-year tax credit
   of 10 percent of the purchase price (up to $6,500) on new or existing
   homes for a first-time homebuyer. A companion bill, H.R. 1773, has been
   introduced in the House and has 35 bipartisan co-sponsors. The credit
   would apply to homes purchased between September 1, 2001, and September
   1, 2002.
