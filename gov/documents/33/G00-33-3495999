   This site is one element of a cooperative effort by New York's 11
   Comprehensive Research Libraries (NYCRL) to create a New York State
   Digital Library. The digital library will ultimately consist of
   electronic resources from the 11 NYCRL libraries and from libraries,
   archives and special collections throughout New York. This project is
   part of a national effort to develop digital libraries; it will also
   ensure public access to the rich research resources in New York State.
   It includes a collection of web sites that contain documents, images
   and other information pertaining to the history, culture, commerce,
   economic development and other topics relevant to New York State.
   This site was developed with the support of
   The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation
