Observing the Earth

   NPOESS polar-orbiting satellites collect and disseminate data that
   benefit the civilian, scientific, and military communities, saving
   lives and money by improving
     * weather prediction, forecasting, and modeling
     * search and rescue efforts
     * support of general aviation, agriculture, maritime and space
       navigation
     * peacekeeping activities and disaster relief
     * research in Earth science

   Polar-orbiting satellites continuously gather and distribute real-time
   data from space about Earth's
     * Land
     * Oceans
     * Atmosphere
     * Space Environment
     * Climate

Data Products by Discipline

   The centerpiece of the overall convergence effort is the definition,
   design, development, and implementation of the six sensors that will
   gather and distribute data about Earth's disciplines as well as the
   design, development, and integration of the spacecraft vehicle that
   will carry these instruments. The sensors being developed by IPO, will
   be flown aboard NPOESS.
