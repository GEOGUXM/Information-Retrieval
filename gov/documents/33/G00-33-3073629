   The ROWS altimeter operated from NASA's P-3 aircraft near the time of
   ERS-1 SAR overpass with data collected at the points within the ERS-1
   SAR swath as indicated on the maps given above. After conversion of
   ERS-1 SAR and ROWS altimeter data to 10 m wind speed using the
   respective satellite inversion algorithms (CMOD5 and Modified
   Chelton-Wentz), collocated data for each day's flight can be
   overplotted versus time of day. Each plot within a figure represents a
   separate day. The time of each SAR overflight is noted by a solid
   vertical line. Dashed lines denote the +- 30 minute mark. The figure
   shown here presents SAR winds derived using 200 m pixel smoothing to
   derive the wind speed. The ROWS altimeter spatial sampling is of the
   order of 2000 m^2.

                    Empirical method to directly compare

                    ERS-1 SAR and Ku-band altimeter data
     __________________________________________________________________

   An alternative to using wind speed algorithms to compare the two
   differing radar measurements is developed here. The basis is that we
   assume that the altimeter and SAR are both responding to the same
   omni-directional surface slope spectrum. The ROWS altimeter is deriving
   a mean squared surface slope estimate from fall off(or shape) of the
   normalized radar cross section(NRCS), mss_shape. ROWS mss_shape is
   derived over the range of 0 to 12 deg. incidence angle. This is also an
   omni-directional measurement: return signal is an integration of all
   azimuth look directions. The SAR gives an absolute value of NRCS at a
   given incidence angle between 19 and 26 deg.. from some single fixed
   look direction WRT the surface wind direction.

   To compare the data we would like isolate the omni-directional
   component in the SAR signal and compare this to mss_shape.

   The standard scatterometer model for the SAR can be written as :
   NRCS_sar=A0_sar+ A2_sar*cos(2*phi). In this case, A0_sar represents the
   mean, omni-directional radar return we wish to isolate. From
   investigation related to the CMOD C-band wind(u) algorithm validations,
   A2_sar can be written as A2_sar=A0_sar(f/(f+2)), where f= bu^2 + c. For
   the ERS-1 incidence angles we have b=3.e-3 and c=0.15. This A2
   coefficient defines the weighting of the wind direction component of
   the total SAR NRCS.

   Returning to main SAR eqn. then we can solve for A0_sar as:

   A0_sar=NRCS/[1+f*cos(2*phi)/(f+2)] where f=A2_sar. In this case, NRCS,
   phi and u are all known (NRCS is measured, phi is derived from in situ,
   U from CMOD).

   Next, based on recent investigations os the surface slope PDF, a model
   relating mss_shape to A0_sar has been developed:
   A0_shape=!pi*.64/cos(theta)^4*exp(a-b*tan(theta)). Here, theta = SAR
   incidence angle, a=3.55-0.62*u, b=2.2/sqrt(mss_shape).

   We can now compare the A0 coefficients derived based on above equations
   and using the collected SAR and altimeter measurements. Results of the
   along-track flight data shown here look promising. At this stage the
   agreement is striking except in the case of very light winds where the
   conversion of mss_shape to C-band A0 is not working well.
