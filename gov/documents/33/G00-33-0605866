     The group focuses on research in computer vision, bioinformatic,
     information visualization, and distributed computing. In the area of
     computer vision research, we have developed algorithms for
     segmentation, tracking, shape recovery, and visual servoing. These
     techniques are being applied for understanding biophysical
     properties in the cell, oceanic dynamics, and nanostructures in
     material science. In the area of bioinformatic, the group has
     developed a system to study phenomics or patterns of protein
     expression. In the area of information visualization, the group
     focuses on feature-based representation of large volume of data.
     These representations are leading toward new predictive models based
     on large scale quantitative analysis of spatio-temporal images. In
     the area of distributed computing, the group has developed a channel
     for microscopy over the wide area network. This system, named
     DeepView, couples remote shared operation of scientific instruments
     with visual routines to bring new functionalities to the unique
     scientific instruments in National laboratories.
