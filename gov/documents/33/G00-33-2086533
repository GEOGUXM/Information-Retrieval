   The purpose of this web page is to present the results of several fire
   experiments performed recently at BFRL in several different formats.

   Each example will:
    1. present a plot of the fire's heat release rate,
    2. display still pictures and video's of the fire,
    3. present data obtained from the fire experiment in a form usable by
       a zone fire model.
