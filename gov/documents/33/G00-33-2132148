   Katharine Lilan Shalf

   [tigergif.gif]

Katharine Lilan was born on April 3, 1998. She was named after her father' s
old music teacher (some variation in the name), Kathleen and her mother's
favorite actress, Katharine Hepburn. Her Chinese name means "morning mountain
mist." Her parents miss the mountains in Virginia even though they now live
in the Midwest.

Katharine was born in the year of tiger and she firmly believes that the
universe is her kingdom. She is more than ready to show her tiger power
(angry screams for now) when her demands are not met within 2 seconds.

   As first time parents, Katharine's mom and dad have great expectations
   and grand plans for her. Their highest hope is that she will become a
   young lady who is pretty without vanity, intelligent without arrogance,
   and morally centered without self-righteousness.
