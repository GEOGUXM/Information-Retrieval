     NIST works to assure that the U.S. realization of the basic and
   derived measurement units is consistent with the realization in other
   nations. NIST Laboratories engage in a number of international
   activities to support trade and global science, and to promote the
   international acceptance of U.S. measurement standards.

       Metrology Institutes (NMIs) with respect to capabilities,
       measurements, and measurement standards.
     * Inter-American Metrology System (SIM) Technical Committee —
       Information and Support area for the SIM TC. A cooperation among
       the 34 members of the Organization of American States in
       establishing national and regional measurement systems and
       standards that are accepted world-wide.
