                              GENERAL INFORMATION

                      Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT)

NEAT is an autonomous celestial observatory developed by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory and funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to
study asteroids and comets. The NEAT principal investigator is Dr. Eleanor F.
Helin, with co-investigators Dr. Steven H. Pravdo, also the project manager, and
Dr. David Rabinowitz (now of Yale University). Discoveries are reported to the
Minor Planet Center, whose WWW site contains new objects which require
confirmation by observers.

2000-

    The NEAT system (as described below) is now mounted on the Maui Space
    Surveillance Site (MSSS) 1.2-m telescope. NEAT is a cooperative effort
    between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Jet Propulsion
    Laboratory and the United States Air Force. It is designed to complete a
    comprehensive search of the sky for near-Earth asteroids and comets. Further
    description and images of NEAT and the 1.2-m are shown here. Plans call for
    NEAT to begin observing 18 nights each month starting in February 2000.

1995-1999

    NEAT was first located at the USAF/Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space
    Surveillance (GEODSS) site on Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii. JPL designed,
    fabricated, and installed the NEAT camera and computer system on a 1-m
    GEODSS telescope. The USAF through its contractor, PRC, Inc., operates NEAT.
    NEAT began observing in December 1995 and observed for 12 nights each month
    centered near the new moon through December 1996. Beginning in January 1997
    NEAT observed for 6 nights each month starting 6 nights prior to the new
    moon. NEAT last observations on GEODSS were in February 1999.
