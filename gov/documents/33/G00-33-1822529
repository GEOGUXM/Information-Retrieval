Environmental Information

   PBTs | Watersheds | Estuaries | Groundwater | Waste | Air |
   Watch Over Washington | EIM | GIS

   The Department of Ecology works to provide reliable environmental
   information. Here are links to reports and data that try to answer the
   question: How are we doing? For an introduction and overview see
   Washington's Environmental Health 2000.

PBTs  go to top of the page
(Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic Chemicals)

   PBTs are toxic chemicals that persist in the environment. Ecology has
   released a draft PBT reduction strategy for public comment. This draft
   strategy calls for making continual reductions of PBT releases into
   Washington's environment over the next 20 years. A "starter list" of 9
   PBT chemicals is proposed.
