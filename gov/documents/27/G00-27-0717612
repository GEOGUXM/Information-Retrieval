   What is USAID?

   The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is an independent
   agency that provides economic, development and humanitarian assistance
    around the world in support of the foreign policy goals of the United
                                   States.

      USAID is located in the Ronald Reagan Building, 1300 Pennsylvania

                        What is USAID's phone number?

          I would like the address of one of your offices overseas.

      I am a student majoring in International Affairs. I am writing a
              research paper and need to know more about USAID.

      USAID is an independent federal government agency responsible for
     providing economic and humanitarian assistance around the globe. To
     read more about USAID and the history of foreign assistance please
         visit the following web site: http://www.usaid.gov/about/.
                               [Return to top]

    I would like information on U.S. foreign aid policy. I would like to
    know how much the American taxpayer is giving to each country and how
                             it is being spent.

     The United States has a long history of extending a helping hand to
   those people overseas struggling to make a better life, recover from a
    disaster or striving to live in a free and democratic country. It is
    this caring that stands as a hallmark of the United States around the
        world -- and shows the world our true character as a nation.

        U.S. foreign assistance has always had the twofold purpose of
    furthering America's foreign policy interests in expanding democracy
      and free markets while improving the lives of the citizens of the
      developing world. Spending less than one-half of 1 percent of the
    federal budget, USAID works around the world to achieve these goals.

    The USAID Congressional Budget Justification (formerly referred to as
   the Congressional Presentation) provides statistical information on the
      foreign assistance programs and activities implemented by USAID:
    http://www.usaid.gov/pubs/. If you are looking for historical data on
      of U.S. foreign assistance activities, you can refer to the USAID
      publication U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants, Obligations and Loan
   Authorizations that contains the financial history of the U.S. foreign
                      assistance programs back to 1949.

    I'm interested in employment with USAID. Where can I find information
                                on vacancies?

    For information on employment at USAID, please visit our web site at:
                   http://www.usaid.gov/about/employment/.

    Currently there are limited opportunities available for the New Entry
      Professional Program (Foreign Service), Mid-level Hires (Foreign
                 Service,) and some Civil Service positions.

    I am not a U.S. citizen, but I am interested in working for USAID at
               one of your offices overseas. How may I apply?

    Although USAID operates from headquarters in Washington, D.C., if you
   are interested in employment in one of our Missions overseas, you must
      apply directly to that Mission. A full listing of our missions is
                                available at:
      http://www.usaid.gov/procurement_bus_opp/osdbu/guide10a.htm. Your
   expression of interest and resume (or any other appropriate materials)
    should be sent to the attention of the USAID Mission in which you are
                           interested in working.

           For a list of USAID Missions on the web, please visit:
                       http://www.usaid.gov/missions/.

   How can I locate a former USAID employee who retired over 7 years ago?

     USAID's personnel records center does not keep records on inactive
   employees beyond 7 (seven) years. Please contact the National Archives
   and Records Administration, National Personnel Records Center (Civilian
        Personnel Records) 111 Winnebago Street, St. Louis, MO 63118.

   I am interested in knowing more about USAID study scholarships offered
            to international students and how to apply for them.

    USAID does not provide tuition grants or scholarships to individuals.
        Such applicants should contact the U.S. Department of State:
                    http://exchanges.state.gov/education/

   You may also visit the following USAID web site to find out other ways
             that you may be able to obtain tuition assistance:
            http://www.usaid.gov/educ_training/scholarship.html.
                               [Return to top]

          Could you provide me with a list of Private Voluntary and
             Non-Governmental organizations working with USAID?

   The USAID Office of Private and Voluntary Cooperation (PVC) publication
     "2001 Voluntary Foreign Aid Programs: Report of Voluntary Agencies
    Engaged in Overseas Relief and Development (THE VOLAG REPORT) can be
      accessed at: http://www.usaid.gov/hum_response/pvc/pvcpubs.html.

   This comprehensive report lists all private and voluntary organizations
   (PVOs) registered with USAID. The report also contains descriptions of
     each PVO's activities and financial data, including its privateness
     percentage, which is provided to USAID by the PVO during the annual
   registration process. The VolAg Report contains key contact information
      for each PVO, including the name of its chief executive officer,
     mailing address, telephone, fax number, and Internet address, where
                                 available.
                               [Return to top]

   We are a U.S. non-profit organization and would like to know how we can
                  get funding for our programs from USAID.

   All USAID solicitations are posted on the USAID Business & Procurement
    Internet site. Instructions on how to apply for each USAID-solicited
     program are contained in each solicitation. Each solicitation also
       includes a point of contact and contact information. If you are
    interested in submitting an "unsolicited" proposal for USAID review,
      follow instructions provided in Contract Information Bulletin No.
                                   99-18.

       In addition to the above, the USAID Office of Private Voluntary
   Cooperation (PVC) offers programs specifically targeted to a subsector
       of the "non-profit" organizations -- the U.S. Private Voluntary
    Organizations (PVOs). PVC provides direct support to efforts made by
      the U.S. PVO community and by its local partner non-governmental
    organizations (NGO) to address critical needs in developing countries
    and emerging democracies. The primary way PVC supports its mission is
   through the competitive grant programs it administers. If you are a PVO
    and would like to work with PVC or USAID overseas, you must register
   with USAID. Information on PVC and PVO registration can be accessed at:
            http://www.usaid.gov/hum_response/pvc/overview.html.

    If you are a non-profit organization based outside the United States,
   you should contact the USAID mission in the country you are interested
    in working. For a complete listing of the USAID missions, please see:
        http://www.usaid.gov/procurement_bus_opp/osdbu/guide10a.htm.

   Worldwide business opportunities (in the form of solicitations) can be
               found on the USAID Business & Procurement site:
     http://www.usaid.gov/procurement_bus_opp/. This page also contains
