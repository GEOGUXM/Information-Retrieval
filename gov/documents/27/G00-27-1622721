   CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CHALLENGE

   More Energy Links...
   California continues to experience electrical shortages that threaten
   rolling blackouts. To reduce the risk of power outages, the most
   important thing you can do is reduce your demand for electricity and
   use energy more efficiently.
   California has the power of the world's sixth largest economy. Your
   individual efforts, multiplied by 35 million Californians, will make a
   real and immediate difference.

   All you have to do is FLEX YOUR POWER

   Simple things that you can do right now at home and at work to reduce
   demand and cut your own energy costs:
     * Minimize your energy use during peak demand hours from 5 a.m. to 9
       a.m. and 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.
     * Turn off unneeded lights and appliances.
     * Turn computers, copiers and other business equipment to their
       energy-saving settings. And turn them off at the end of the day.
     * Avoid running large appliances such as washers, dryers, and
       electric ovens during peak demand hours.
     * Turn thermostats down to 68 degrees or below. Reduce settings to 55
       degrees before going to sleep or when away for the day. For each
       1-degree reduction, you'll save up to 5% on your heating costs.
     * Close shades and blinds at night to reduce the amount of heat lost
       through windows.
     * Buy Energy Star appliances, products and lights.

   Tips for Kids and Teachers:

     * Choose an energy monitor for your classroom every week who will
       make sure that energy is being used properly.
     * Start an "Energy Patrol" at school and at home. Check out the
       California Energy Commission's website --
       www.energy.ca.gov/education for more ideas.
     * At home, hold a ribbon up to the edges of windows and doors. If it
       blows, you've found a leak. Tell your parents.
     * When you leave the room -- turn off the light.
