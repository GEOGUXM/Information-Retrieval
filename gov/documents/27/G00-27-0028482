         Nearly two-thirds of the entire North Pacific population of humpback
      whales migrates to Hawaii each winter for breeding, calving and nursing
                        activities critical to the survival of their species.

A Sanctuary Dedicated to the Endangered Humpback Whale and its Habitat

   The Hawaiian Islands are the world's most isolated island archipelago,
   born of ancient volcanoes and inhabited by animals and plants derived
   from ancestors that found their way here over thousands of miles of
   ocean. According to scientists, the shallow, warm waters surrounding
   the main Hawaiian Islands constitute one of the world's most important
   habitats for the endangered humpback whale. Nearly two-thirds of the
   entire North Pacific population of humpback whales migrates to Hawai`i
   each winter. Here, they engage in breeding, calving and nursing
   activities critical to the survival of their species.

   The sanctuary is also home to a fascinating array of marine animals,
   corals and plants, some of which are found nowhere else on Earth. Its
   cultural heritage includes Native Hawaiian traditions of living in
   harmony with the sea. Its waters invite activities such as diving,
   boating and snorkeling, and support commercial uses such as fishing and
   shipping.

The corals of the Hawaiian Islands, such as the Finger coral (Porites
compressa) pictured here, are rich in diversity and support an
abundance of life. Coral habitats are found extensively throughout the
Sanctuary.

The Work of the Sanctuary

   The Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary is one of
   13 national marine sanctuaries created under the U.S. Marine
   Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act. The sanctuary's goal is to
   promote comprehensive and coordinated management, research, education
   and long-term monitoring for the endangered humpback whale and its
   habitat.

   The sanctuary focuses its efforts on a variety of issues, including
   supporting the work of marine researchers, coordinating and
   participating in community outreach projects, developing educational
   displays, and working cooperatively with local organizations, agencies
   and volunteers to address resource protection and public awareness.
