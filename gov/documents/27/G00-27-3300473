Introduction

   Vegetation changes caused by climatic variations and/or land use may
   have large impacts on forests, agriculture, rangelands, natural
   ecosystems, and endangered species. Climate modeling studies indicate
   that vegetation cover, in turn, has a strong influence on regional
   climates, and this must be better understood before models can estimate
   future environmental conditions. To address these issues, this project
   investigates vegetational response to climatic change, and
   vegetation-land surface impacts on climate change. The project involves
   calibration of the modern relations between the range limits of plant
   species and climatic variables, relations that are then used: 1) to
   estimate past climatic fluctuations from paleobotanical data for a
   number of time periods within the late Quaternary; 2) to 'validate'
   climate model simulations of past climates; 3) to explore the potential
   influences of land cover changes on climate change; and 4) to estimate
   the potential future ranges of plant species under a number of future
   climate scenarios. Methodologies and data developed by this project are
   being used as part of the national global change assessment of
   potential impacts of future climate changes.
