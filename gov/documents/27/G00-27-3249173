    If you have pictures you'd like to share with everyone mail them to:
                                Chet Wilberg
                               341 Perch Lane
                              Winsted, MN 55395

   If you want your pictures returned, please include a message to let me
     know that, a return address, and put your name on all pictures with
    something other than a ball-point pen as this creates lines that show
                  thru onto the other side of the picture.

              Or, you can e-mail them to cwilberg@mnwg.cap.gov.
