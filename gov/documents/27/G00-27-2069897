                       ESH-17 Air Quality Evaluations

        These reports focus on individual air quality issues that are
     investigated and evaluated by the Air Quality Group as they become
                                 identified.

                         Environmental Surveillance

     These annual reports summarize environmental data that comply with
         applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws and
   regulations, executive orders and DOE policies. Additional data, beyond
       the minimum required, are gathered and reported as part of the
         Laboratory's efforts to ensure public safety and to monitor
              environmental quality at and near the Laboratory.

                         Radionuclide Air Emissions

      Laboratory-wide certified reports regarding radioactive effluents
     released into the air by the Laboratory during each calendar year.
    These reports to EPA are requried as part of our compliance with the
                               Clean Air Act.

                     New Mexico 2.73 Emissions Inventory

      The Laboratory is subject to emissions reporting requirements for
         regulated air contaminants under Title 20 of the New Mexico
      Administrative Code, Chapter 2, Part 73, (20 NMAC 2.73) Notice of
                Intent and Emissions Inventory Requirements.

       Toxic Chemical Release Inventory for the Emergency Planning and
                         Community Right-to-Know Act

   The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986
   [also known as the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act (SARA),
    Title III], requires that all federal facilities evaluate the need to
   submit an annual Toxic Chemical Release Inventory report as prescribed
    by this Act. This annual report is due every July for the preceeding
       calendar year. Owners and operators who manufacture, process or
   otherwise use certain toxic chemicals above listed threshold quantities
         are required to report their toxic chemical releases to all
               environmental media (air, water, soils, etc.).
