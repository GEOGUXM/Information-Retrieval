                          Defining Electromagnetics

     "An important dynamic effect in electromagnetics is the generation
     of electric fields by time-varying magnetic fields, as expressed by
     Faraday's law. Another is the complementary effect whereby
     time-varying electric fields produce magnetic fields. This latter
     effect is expressed through the concept of displacement current,
     introduced by Maxwell.

     "There is a far-reaching conclusion of the fact that changing
     magnetic flux density produces a change in electric fields and vice
     versa; it leads to propagation of electromagnetic waves. In general,
     wave phenomena result when there are two forms of energy, and the
     presence of a change in one leads to a change of another. If we
     change the magnetic field at one position, this generates a change
     of electric field in both time and space, by Faraday's law. The
     subsequent change of the electric field produces a change of
     magnetic field through the displacement current, and so on. In
     energy terms, the energy interchanges between electric and magnetic
     types as the wave progresses.

     "Electromagnetic waves exist in nature in the radiation that takes
     place when atoms or molecules change from one energy state to a
     lower one, with frequencies from the microwave through visible into
     x-ray regions of the spectrum. (Still lower frequencies are
     generated by lightning and other natural fluctuation.) These natural
     radiations are utilized in astronomy and radio astronomy.
     Telecommunications, navigational guidance, radar, and power
     transmission depend on our ability to generate, guide, store,
     radiate, receive, and detect electromagnetic waves. This involves
     many kinds of structures whose properties the designer must be able
     to predict. The complete set of laws for time-varying
     electromagnetic phenomena is known as Maxwell's equations and are
     central to such predictions."
