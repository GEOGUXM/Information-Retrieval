   Child Labor Reform Stamp
   "This postage stamp bears a picture of a little girl named Addie Laird.
   It was taken by the noted photographer of child labor conditions, Louis
   Wickes Hine. The title of the original photograph is Anemic Little
   Spinner in North Pownal Cotton Mill, North Pownal, Vermont, August
   1910. The accompanying caption, from the records of the National Child
   Labor Committee, reads:

     Addie Laird,12 years, spinner in North Pownal cotton mill, North
     Pownal, Vermont. Girls in mill say she is ten years. She admitted to
     me she was twelve; that she started during school vacation and now
     would "stay".
     -witness E.F. Brown.

   The U.S. Postal Service issued this first stamp to commemorate Child
   Labor Reform in 1998; it was unveiled in January of that year by
   Secretary of labor Alexis M. Herman. The Postal Service presented the
   DOL Library with a framed enlargement of the stamp in acknowledgment of
   the Library's participation in the unveiling ceremonies with exhibits
   and bibliographies on child labor. It remains on permanent display in
   the Library."
