                             Chemical Castration

   On September 18, 1996, AB 3339 became law, amending section 645 of the
   Penal Code. The amended statute provides that any person guilty of a
   first conviction of specified sex offenses, where the victim is under
   13 years of age, may be required to receive medroxy progesterone
   acetate treatment upon parole, and any person convicted of two such
   offenses must receive the treatment during parole. This medication is
   administered by injection and has the effect of lowering the
   testosterone level, blunting the sex drive. The parolee begins the
   treatments prior to his release on parole and the treatments continue
   until the Department of Corrections demonstrates to the Board of Prison
   Terms that this treatment is no longer necessary.
