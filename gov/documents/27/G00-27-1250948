                        CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CHALLENGE


   The energy challenge facing California is real.


   California continues to experience electrical shortages that threaten
   rolling blackouts throughout the State.  To reduce the risk of power
   outrages, the most important thing we can do in the short-term is
   reduce our demand for electricity and use energy more efficiently.


   The Governor and leaders of the California Legislature are working with
   utility companies, generators and consumer groups to fashion long-term
   solutions for reliable and affordable electricity.  The State has
   already implemented a plan to reduce consumption by 8-10 percent across
   the board.


   And you have an important role to play right now.


   We in California have the power of 35 million people and the sixth
   largest economy in the world.  By reducing our electricity demand we
   can help avoid shortages and lower energy bills.


   All you have to do is FLEX YOUR POWER.


   Simple things that you can do right now to reduce demand and cut your
   own energy costs:


       U Turn thermostats down to 68 degrees or below.  Reduce settings to
   55 degrees before going

          to sleep or when away for the day.  For each 1 degree, you'll
   save up to 5% on your heating costs.

       U Turn off non-essential lights and appliances.

       U Avoid running large appliances such as washers, dryers, and
   electric ovens from 4:00-8.00 p.m.

       U Close shades and blinds at night to reduce the amount of heat
   lost through windows.  Close off

          vents in rooms that are not being used.

       U Buy Energy Star appliances, products and lights.
