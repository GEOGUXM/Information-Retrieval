   About OIT

   OIT supports technology partnerships to improve industrial energy
   efficiency today and tomorrow. Our brochures and briefing summarize our
   strategy, scope, and successes.

   Partnership Strategy

   Since 1994, U.S. industries have used our Industries of the Future
   strategy to set their own R&D goals and priorities. As detailed in our
   Strategic Plan, the bulk of our budget goes to providing cost-shared
   support to selected R&D partnershipsÂ—partnerships that pool the
   resources of industry, academia, and government to accelerate the pace
   of R&D in meeting industry's top needs and achieving national goals for
   energy and the environment.
