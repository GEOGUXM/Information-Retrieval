     What is asbestos?
     Asbestos is the name for a group of naturally occurring silicate
     minerals that can be separated into fibers. The fibers are strong,
     durable, and resistant to heat and fire.
     There are several types of asbestos fibers, of which three have been
     used for commercial applications: (1) Chrysotile, or white asbestos,
     comes mainly from Canada, and has been very widely used in the US. It
     is white-gray in color and found in serpentine rock. (2) Amosite, or
     brown asbestos, comes from southern Africa. (3) Crocidolite, or blue
     asbestos, comes from southern Africa and Australia.
     Amosite and crocidolite are called amphiboles. This term refers to the
     nature of their geologic formation.
     Other asbestos fibers that have not been used commercially are
     tremolite, actinolite and anthophyllite, although they are sometimes
     contaminants in asbestos-containing products.
