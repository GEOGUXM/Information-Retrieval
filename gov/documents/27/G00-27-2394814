   VA Toast Algorithm for Classification of Stroke (VTACS)
     __________________________________________________________________

   OVERVIEW

   Stroke prognosis, risk of recurrence and choices for management are
   influenced by ischemic stroke subtype. Accordingly, a set of guidelines
   were developed for prospectively classifying ischemic strokes into a
   specific subtype by the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment
   (TOAST) investigators. These guidelines, however, were general in their
   specification and sensitive to clinical interpretation. Consequently,
   the TOAST-based classification of ischemic stroke has proven to be an
   unreliable process and the resulting subtypes are legitimately subject
   to challenge of validity.

   The Veterans Administration Stroke (VASt) Study Team, however, believed
   that reliable and valid subtyping of ischemic stroke could be achieved
   if the TOAST guidelines and underlying decision-making process
   regarding stroke etiology could be made explicit. Moreover, it was
   believed that valid, retrospective subtyping using medical record data
   was also feasible. Accordingly, a series of investigations were
   undertaken. The result was the VA TOAST Algorithm for Classification of
   Stroke (VTACS) and a manual for abstracting the required data from the
   medical record.

   THE TOAST CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

   The TOAST investigators devised a series of 11 definitions to classify
   patients with ischemic stroke into 5 major etiological/
   pathophysiological groupings. Inter-rater agreement was reported to be
   substantial in a series of patients who were independently assessed by
   pairs of physicians. However, the investigators cautioned that
   disagreements in subtype assignment remain despite the use of these
   explicit criteria and that trials should include measures to assure the
   most uniform diagnosis possible.

   VTACS: RELIABILTY AND VALIDITY

   In preparation for a study of outcomes and management practices for
   patients with ischemic stroke within Department of Veterans Affairs
   hospitals, two neurologists and 2 internists first retrospectively
   classified a series of 14 randomly selected stroke patients based on
   the TOAST definitions to provide a baseline assessment of inter-rater
   agreement. The 4 physicians agreed in subtype diagnosis for only 2 of
   the 14 baseline cases (14%) using all 11 TOAST definitions, and for 4
   of the 14 cases (29%) when the classifications were collapsed into the
   5 major etiological/pathophysiological groupings, indicating moderate
   agreement (kappa = 0.42, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.53).

   A two-phase process was then used to improve the reliability of subtype
   assignment. In the first phase, a computerized algorithm was developed
   to assign the TOAST diagnostic category. The reliability of the
   computerized algorithm was tested with a series of synthetic cases
   designed to provide data fitting each of the 11 definitions. There was
   100% agreement between classifications generated by the computerized
   algorithm and the intended diagnostic groups for the 11 synthetic
   cases.

   The algorithm was then applied to the original 14 cases and the
   diagnostic categorization compared with each of the four physiciansâ€™
   baseline assignments. For the 5 collapsed subtypes, the algorithm-based
   and physician-assigned diagnoses disagreed for 29% to 50% of the cases,
   reflecting variation in the abstracted data and/or its interpretation.

   Critical disagreements in the data abstraction process were identified
   and remaining variability reduced by the development of standardized
   procedures for retrieving relevant information from the medical record.
   The use of an operations manual designed to guide data abstraction
   improved reliability to a moderate level (kappa = 0.54, 95% CI 0.26 to
   0.82). Critical disagreements in the abstracted data were identified
   and the manual revised accordingly. Reliability using the 5 collapsed
   groupings then improved to substantial levels of both inter-rater
   (kappa = 0.68, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91) and intra-rater (kappa=0.74, 95% CI
   0.61 to 0.87) agreement. Examining each remaining disagreement revealed
   that half were due to ambiguities in the medical record and half were
   related to otherwise unexplained errors in data abstraction.

   SUMMARY

   Ischemic stroke subtype based on published TOAST classification
   criteria can be reliably assigned using a computerized algorithm with
   data obtained through standardized medical record abstraction
   procedures. Some variability in stroke subtype classification will
   remain because of inconsistencies in the medical record and errors in
   data abstraction. This residual variability can be addressed by having
   two raters classify each case and then identify and resolve the
   reason(s) for the disagreement.

   ACCESS AND USE OF THE ALGORITHM

   The VA TOAST Algorithm is available for use by investigators without
   charge. The algorithm may be downloaded by clicking on the link below.
   Please be advised, users of the algorithm assume all responsibility for
   its performance. For those who use the algorithm in their research, we
   request that you: (1) inform us of your study and provide us with a
   project abstract; (2) notify us of any problems encountered in the use
   of the algorithm; (3) notify us of any modifications made to the
   algorithm that improves its performance; and (4) acknowledge the source
   of the algorithm in all publications arising from investigations that
   involve its use.
