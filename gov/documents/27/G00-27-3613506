   1.     Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to document nomenclature
   and define chain of command for Weather Bureau field stations.

   2.     Nomenclature. The following standard nomenclature form is to be
   used for Weather Bureau field stations ("field station" as used here
   denotes any operational field facility performing forecasting, service,
   and/or observing functions):

   National Meteorological Center (NMC); National Severe Storms Forecast
   Center (NSSFC); National Hurricane Center (NHC) -- These centers,
   comprising the first echelon of the meteorological forecast
   organization, will be known by their individual names, even though
   certain segments of these centers may deal directly with the public.

   Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC); Central Pacific Hurricane
   Center (CPHC) -- These centers, comprising the first echelon of the
   meteorological forecast organization for hurricane forecasting services
   in their areas of responsibility will be known by these titles in
   conjunction with hurricane activities only. At other times they will be
   known by their alternate designators, i.e., WBFO San Francisco and WBFO
   Honolulu.

   Regional Weather Center (RWC) -- A facility with regional
   responsibility for the monitoring and quality control of all
   meteorological forecast products and services provided to users by the
   forecast system. At times its regional warning coordination
   responsibilities entail interpretation of first echelon guidance for
   the use of other Weather Bureau offices.  In addition, aviation areal
   products based upon guidance from NMC, NSSFC, and/or NHC may be
   prepared and disseminated directly to users.

   River Forecast Center (RFC) -- A facility in the first echelon of the
   hydrologic forecast organization. This center does not usually have
   contact with the public. River forecast and\flood warning distribution
   is made by a Weather Bureau Forecast Office (WBFO), or in some
   instances by a Weather Bureau Office (WBO), which has been assigned
   river district and hydrologic data collection and dissemination
   responsibilities.

   Weather Bureau Forecast Office (WBFO) -- A facility in the second
   echelon of the forecast organization which prepares forecasts in one or
   more programs based upon guidance from NMC, NSSFC, NHC, EPHC, and/or
   CPHC (aided by non-routine RWC interpretation of this guidance). Many
   other functions may be performed within this office or under the
   direction of the MIC of this office.

   Weather Bureau Office (WBO) -- A facility in the third echelon of the
   forecast organization providing forecasts and services in one or more
   programs directly to users, based at least in part upon advice
   contained in forecast products prepared by a WBFO (forecast procedures
   require that all (forecast--products being issued for an area must be
   consistent with the current WBFO public forecasts for that area); or a
   facility without forecast responsibility providing service to users
   (e.g., a state climatologist's office).

   Weather Bureau Meteorological Observatory (WBMO) -- A facility which is
   devoted to the conduct of one or more observing programs.

   It will be permissible to use more definitive terminology for
   single-purpose offices when required for clarity, e.g., WBO
   (Agriculture), WBO (Aviation), WBO (State Climatology), or WBO (Fire
   Weather).

   3.     Chain of Command. This section defines, in broad   terms, the
   chain of command for Weather Bureau field facilities (see chapters C-40
   and C-41 for detailed discussions of day-to-day working relationships
   in the tornado and hurricane program areas). No attempt is made to
   indicate delegation below the director level. For example, in some
   regions the WBFO's may-report to the Chief, Operations, on most
   matters. Such arrangements are to be defined elsewhere (ROML's, program
   letters, and/or ESSA organizational handbook issuances).

   3.1     National Meteorological Center (NMC). NMC reports directly to
   the Director, Weather Bureau.

   3.2     National Hurricane Center (NHC). NHC reports directly to the
   Director, Weather Bureau, on all technical matters pertaining to the
   national hurricane warning service. On other technical and
   administrative matters the NHC reports to the Director, Southern
   Region.

   3.3     Other First Echelon Centers. All other first echelon centers
   (EPHC, CPHC, NSSFC, RWC's, and RFC's) report directly to the
   appropriate regional director.

   3.4     Weather Bureau Forecast Offices (WBPO); Weather Bureau Offices
   (WBO); Weather Bureau Meteorological Observatories (WBMO). These
   offices report directly to the regional director, with one exception.
   At the option of the regional director WBO's and WBMD's in the same
   general vicinity of a larger office may be attached to that office.
   Usually this arrangement will be limited to situations where the
   offices are in the same metropolitan area.
