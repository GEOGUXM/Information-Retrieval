       National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Current Events

   OSEI dust storm products include multichannel color composite imagery
   and animations of meso- to large-scale dust storm events (DST). We also
   create grayscale "split-window" images which use a channel differencing
   technique that enhances the appearance of dust clouds in imagery (DIF).
   This technique is often useful for distinguishing dust clouds from
   water vapor clouds.
