                                    FACTS
   Each year for the past 36 years, the President of the United States has
       issued a proclamation calling for the celebration of Small Business
       Week. This year, National Small Business Week, which is sponsored
       by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), will be held from
       May 23 29, 1999. The celebration will honor the estimated 24
       million small businesses in America that employ more than half the
       country's private work force, create two of every three new jobs,
       and generate a majority of American innovations.
       Small Business Person of the Year
       Small Business Week recognizes outstanding small business owners
       for their personal achievements and contributions to our nation's
       economy. One outstanding entrepreneur is named to represent each
       state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam as the state
       Small Business Person of the Year. From this group, the national
       Small Business Person of the Year is chosen.
       Trade associations, chambers of commerce and business organizations
       frequently sponsor candidates. Sponsors submit a nomination package
       to the nearest SBA district office for review and selection by each
       district's Small Business Advisory Council. Nomination packages are
       then sent to regional SBA offices and prepared for transmittal to
       the SBA Office of Advisory Councils for review. The national Small
       Business Person of the Year will be selected by the SBA
       Administrator based on the recommendations of the National Advisory
       Council and will be announced during Small Business Week.
       Selection criteria for Small Business Persons of the Year are:

   Staying power: a substantiated history as an established business.
       Growth in number of employees: a benchmark to judge the impact of
       the business on the job market.
       Increase in sales and/or unit volume: an indication of continued
       growth.
       Current and past financial reports: substantiating the improved
       financial position of the business; a profit-and-loss statement and
       balance sheet for the last three complete years.
       Innovative product or service: illustration of the creativity and
       imagination of the nominee.
       Response to adversity: examples of problems faced in the nominee's
       business and the methods used to solve them.
       Contributions by nominee to aid community- oriented projects:
       through the use of his/her personal time and other resources.

   Small Business Advocates and Special Award Winners

   During Small Business Week, Small Business Advocates and Special Award
   Winners are also honored.

   A small business advocate is an individual who has used his or her
   professional expertise or personal talents to further the understanding
   and awareness of small business. These individuals have also taken an
   active role in creating opportunities for small business.

   The following small business advocate awards are presented:
     * Minority Small Business Advocate of the Year
     * Women in Business Advocate of the Year
     * Veteran Small Business Advocate of the Year
     * Accountant Advocate of the Year
     * Financial Services Advocate of the Year
     * Media Advocate of the Year

   The special awards category recognizes a top young entrepreneur, a
   small business exporter and a former "small" business by SBA size
   standards that has grown into a large business with SBA assistance.

   In 1998, two new awards were added to the special awards category: the
   Phoenix Awards and the Welfare-to-Work Awards. Phoenix Awards are given
   to individuals whose efforts and contributions enabled their businesses
   or communities to recover successfully from a disaster. Welfare-to-Work
   Awards are presented to former welfare recipients who are now
   self-supporting entrepreneurs and to individuals who have contributed
   to the Welfare-to-Work initiative.
