   Pulsed Power Technology
   at Sandia National Laboratories

   Pulsed power technology is used to generate and apply energetic beams
   and high-power energy pulses. It is distinguished by the development of
   repetitive pulsed-power technologies, x-ray and energetic beam sources,
   and electromagnetic and radiation-hydrodynamic codes for a wide variety
   of applications. Examples of these applications include nuclear
   survivability and hardness testing, z-pinch-driven soft x-ray sources,
   light-ion-beam inertial confinement fusion, materials processing, waste
   and product sterilization, and food purification. Facilities include
   the Saturn x-ray source, the SABRE pulsed power testbed for light ion
   research, the High-Energy Radiation Megavolt Electron Source (HERMES)
   III for gamma rays and advanced hydrodynamic radiography research, and
   the Z facility for producing a high power (290 trillion watt) source of
   soft x rays for stockpile stewardship studies.
