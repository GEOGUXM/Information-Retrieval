  Goal

   The National Weather Service is undertaking an unprecedented
   Moderization and Associated Restructuring (MAR) program that will
   result in improvement in weather and hydrologic warning and forecast
   services in the United States. The opportunity now exists for the NWS
   to further enhance these services by increasing its emphasis on
   hydrometeorology. This emphasis will be achieved by capitalizing on the
   overlapping aspects of hydrologic and meteorologic science and
   technology and by instituting new operations designed to enhance
   interaction and transfer of information between hydrologists and
   meteorologists.

  New Technology

   The implementation of advance technology such as the Advanced Weather
   Interactive Processing System (AWIPS), Next Generation Weather Radar
   (NEXRAD), Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), and the next
   generation of Satellite remote sensing equipment is the driving force
   behind the modernization and restructuring of the NWS. For example, NWS
   plans call for a new class of office called Weather Forecast Office
   (WFO), which will be colocated with the new NEXRAD facilities to
   capitalize on new technology and optimize service delivery. The
   hydrology program of the NWS will also capitalize on these technologies
   by using the new information provided to produce more accurate, more
   site specific, and more timely hydrologic forecast products. There will
   be strong interaction and cooperation with other water resources
   agenccies to share these technologies.

  Major Changes in Hydrologic Service Program

   Improvements will be obtained through implementation of enhanced
   advanced hydrologic modeling systems, comprehensive data bases, data
   integration techniques, advance satellite and aircraft observation,
   meteorological and climate forecasts, and improved real-time
   information exchange. The Advanced Hydrologic Prediction for Water
   Resources and Emergency Management (AHPS) will produce hydrologic
   forecasts with lead times of a few days to several months. The system
   will provide better overall information for use in managing competing
   water demands for irrigation, fisheries, hydropower and other purposes.

  Northwest River Forecast Modernization Programs

    Hydrologic Model Changes (SSARR to NWSRFS)

   The Northwest River Forecast Center is currently using the Streamflow
   Synthesis and Reservoir Regulation Model (SSARR) as it's principle
   forecasting system. This modelling system was developed in the mid-50s
   through a cooperative program between the US Corps of Engineers,
   National Weather Service and the Bonneville Power Administration. The
   SSARR is a lumped, non-continuous mathematical river model, with
   components to model watershed hydrology, river reach routings and
   provide reservoir regulation capabilities.
   In the fall of 1993, the Northwest River Forecast Center began a major
   development effort to implement the National Weather Service River
   Forecast System (NWSRFS). This new model offers a chance to improve
   real-time flood forecasting techniques and long-term water management
   forecasts. This decision was made to otimize support resources and to
   take advantage of the modernized changes taking place in the NWS.
   The NWSRFS is a lumped, physically based, continous hydrologic modeling
   system designed to simulate surface water conditions in a complicated
   rain and snow enviroment. It is a set of hydrologic models; including
   the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accouting model, Eric Anderson's Snow-17
   energy balance snow accumulation and ablation model, several API
   rainfall-runoff models, routing routings, and reservoir regulation
   schemes. Several of the models found in the SSARR have been added to
   NWSRFS, including the reservoir regulation model, river reach routing
   and the 3-variable look-up technique.

Modernized Technologies

  NWSRFS

   NWSRFS consists of a number of computer models and procedures that
   simulate complex hydrologic and hydraulic processes, such as soil
   moisture accouting, channel routing, and reservoir operations. The same
   models are used in all components of the NWSRFS. The components of the
   NWSRFS are:
     * Calibration System (CS). The calibration processes historical
       hydrometeorological data to estimate hydrologic model parameters of
       a basin for use in the forecast system.
     * Operational Forecast System (OFS). The Operational Forecast System
       uses real-time data as input to the calibrated models to generate
       streamflow forecasts for hours or a few days into the future. The
       system also keeps track of the current model states for use in
       producing ESP forecasts. OFS is run daily at the River Forecast
       Center.
     * Interactive Forecast Program (IFP). The Interactive Forecast
       Program is the real-time version of OFS. This system allows a
       forecaster to interactiviely generate forecasts for hours or a few
       days into the future. IFP uses the same models as the OFS and
       provides the same information as OFS; but, also allows a forecaster
       to interactively perform a "what-if" analysis more easily.
     * Externded Streamflow Prediction System (ESP). The ESP system uses
       present watershed conditions and the updated values of the state
       variables produced by OFS, combined with future time series of
       precipitation temperature, and evaporation to produce probability
       estimates for a number of streamflow variables. The procedure
       assumes that any of the historical time series of precipitation,
       temperature, evaporation have equal probability of occurring in the
       current year. When these time series and the updated values of the
       state variables are run through the calibrated simulation system, a
       set of discharge time series are produced. Generally, at least 20
       years of historical data is used to ensure accurate probability
       estimates. Current short-term meteorological forecasts are used to
       provide a transition into the future. Probability forecast are then
       generated by analyzing the series of discharges for a given period
       of time (forecast window) and for certain streamflow variables.

   STATUS: NWRFC has completed calibration in Western Washington and
   Western Oregon. Calibration has begun in the Upper Columbia River
   Basin. NWSRFS is used exclusively for forecasting west of the Cascades.
   We have re-calibrated the Lower Columbia River using a Dynamic Wave
   hydraulic model which is now part of NWSRFS. We have implemented this
   model in the fall of 1998. SSARR is still the primary forecast modeling
   system for the NWRFC in the Columbia River Basin.
