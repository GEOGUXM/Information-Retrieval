Independent Interface to Educational Uses of High Performance Computing

  Abstract

   We have developed a set of techniques for providing interactive 3D
   visualization via the World Wide Web (WWW) as part of the "Whole Frog"
   project [1] . In the past 10-12 months the resulting WWW "pages" have
   been accessed more than 1,000,000 times from 65 different countries.
   The success of this project indicates that the Web and its associated
   browsers can serve as a versatile and easily used front end to complex
   and high-performance computing resources. In this project, the Common
   Gateway Interface capability of WWW servers is used to provide an
   interactive 3D visualization front-end via Web clients. This approach
   is used to make a "Virtual Frog Dissection Kit" "Virtual Frog
   Dissection Kit" (see [2] and [3] ). A student using this Kit has the
   ability to interactively select, view, and get textual information
   about various parts a frog's anatomy, to control the view angle, and to
   determine which anatomical structures are visible or invisible. A new
   experimental feature allows generation of "movie" clips of rotating 3D
   objects that can be viewed with the user's Web browser.

  Overview

   This note describes work demonstrating the potential of the World Wide
   Web architecture to provide a uniform and easily used interface to
   high-performance computing applications. The back-end computation can
   take place on as complex and powerful a distributed system as needed to
   support the information display on the Web browser, and all of this is
   hidden from the user. The Web browser (e.g. Univ. of Illinois' Mosaic,
   or Netscape Communications Corp.'s Netscape Navigator) is the same one
   that is used to access the many other kinds of information available on
   the Web.

   Use of the Web provides a platform-independent interface to
   applications. Browsers (Web clients) are available for use with most
   common operating systems and window systems (e.g. UNIX, X-Windows,
   DOS/Windows, Macintosh, etc.). The Web support of interactive input
   from browsers (via "forms") provides a significant subset of the
   functionality available with Graphical User Interfaces (GUI's) such as
   X Windows "toolkits".

   The Web's design ([4], [5] ) has proven very versatile, providing for a
   variety of high-level functions. These include:

   (1) Publishing research results from high-performance computing
   projects, including interactive exploration of the data and methods
   used;

   (2) Support of education by providing access to activities that are too
   computationally expensive for most K-12 resources, and;

   (3) Mechanisms for collaboration and sharing possibly scarce and
   expensive remote experimental facilities.

   We have used scientific visualization and education / instructional
   scenarios as sample applications to drive the development of Web
   capabilities that support front-ends for distributed processing. We
   have also considered the issues for using Web-based user interfaces for
   analysis and simulation codes.

   One goal of this project is to explore the ability of the Web to
   provide complex scientific data visualization in a way that end users
   do not necessarily require high-performance rendering systems at their
   location, and can use a variety of personal computers and workstations
   to access the results. An additional goal of the project is to explore
   the capabilities of the Web technology to enable K-12 students to learn
   about and use scientific visualization (and frog anatomy), and
   high-performance computing and networking.

   The problem that we have selected as representative of many kinds of
   scientific visualization is that of visualizing large, 3D scalar
   fields. The example data set is a finely sampled, 3D colored grid of
   the body of a frog. The data includes volume information and
   significant internal surfaces (the anatomical organ boundaries).

   In addition to exploring the interactive capabilities of the Web
   architecture, we are also presented with an interesting exercise in how
   to provide (experimentally) a computationally intense service to a
   large number of users with resources that are simultaneously (and
   primarily) used for other purposes. For example, the experimental
   package being described here - the Virtual Dissection Kit - has been
   accessed more than 1,250,000 times by 80,000 different sites, in over
   65 different countries in the past 10 months. (The "dissection kit"
   page - the basic visualization interface - can, at the selection of the
   user, be displayed in English, Spanish, Dutch, German, and French.) By
   December, 1994 we were servicing 150 requests per hour, 24 hours per
   day, for this Web document. The generation of the more than 200,000
   rendered images satisfying these requests has been done on four or five
   large-ish Unix workstations on a non-interfering basis with our normal
   use of the systems.

   The number of accesses to a WWW page (an individual Web document) used
   for publication or education can vary considerably, depending, for
   example, on how much media attention it is receiving at any particular
   moment. Unless access to a page is restricted, the HTTP server (the
   system that receives and processes requests from Web browsers) must be
   prepared to handle a potentially large number of accesses per minute.
   If a page's intended use is interactive visualization, or interactive
   instruction, then long waits for an image are not acceptable. Given
   these considerations, one of our principal design goals has been to
   have all of the rendered images of the frog available within a few
   seconds, or less, after the user interaction. This is accomplished by
   having the Web server (a single system) deal only with displaying the
   text parts of the Web document, and redistributing all of the rendering
   (image generation) to five or six other systems.

   The figure below illustrates several features of the frog dissection
   interface: There are buttons that select among the features (anatomical
   objects) to be displayed, the image itself is a "sensitive map", and
   clicking on the edges of the image will cause rotation. The interface
   text can be adapted to the language preferred by the user. A new and
   experimental aspect of the system is to allow the generation of movies.
   The figure-boxes below the main display indicate to generate a movie
   that rotates the selected features of the object around several
   different axes.
