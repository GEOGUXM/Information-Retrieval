   The Chesapeake Bay, the Nation's largest estuary, has been degraded due
   to water quality problems, loss of habitat, and over harvesting of
   living resources. Additionally, the Bay was listed under the Clean
   Water Act as an "impaired water body" due to excess nutrients and
   sediments and must improve water-quality conditions by 2010.

   In response to the problems facing the Bay, the Chesapeake Bay Program
   (CBP), which is a multi-agency partnership, completed Chesapeake 2000,
   a new agreement that revises and establishes new restoration goals for
   the next 10 years in the Bay and its watershed.

   The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), one of the original CBP Federal
   partners, has the critical role to provide unbiased scientific
   information that is utilized to formulate, implement, and assess the
   effectiveness of restoration goals. The USGS Chesapeake Bay Science
   Program is meeting these needs through a combination of research,
   monitoring, modeling, and interaction with the partners in the CBP and
   the Department of Interior (DOI). To meet the expanded needs of
   Chesapeake 2000 and DOI partners, the USGS redefined our science goals:
     * Improve watershed and land-use data to understand changes in water
       quality and living resources.
     * Understand the impact of sediment on water clarity and biota.
     * Enhance the prediction and monitoring of nutrient delivery to the
       Bay.
     * Assess the occurrence of toxic constituents and emerging
       contaminants.
     * Assess the factors affecting the health of fish and water birds.
     * Disseminate information and enhance decision-support tools.

   The USGS Chesapeake Science Program depends on the coordination of
   multiple USGS Programs and partners that have a scientific interest in
   the Bay restoration. Over forty USGS scientists located in offices
   throughout the Bay watershed and at the CBP, are involved in scientific
   investigations and information dissemination. See our Programs and
   Projects page for additional information.

   Highlights of selected U.S. Geological Survey results in support of the
   Chesapeake Bay Restoration Effort are available.

   Projects page has links to the USGS programs focused on the Bay and its
   watershed. The Data page gives information and links on various USGS
   data and spatial information sites focused on the Bay area. Links to
   reports, press releases, and the bilbiography are available on the
   Publications page.
