                 Buy California Marketing Agreement Overview

                            [bc_1.jpg] Background

     California is the largest agricultural state in the U.S., producing
    over 350 commodities. It is the sole U.S. producer of many fruits and
      vegetables. Ironically, Californians take less advantage of this
     agricultural bounty than other U.S. citizens, eating 24% less fresh
     fruits and vegetables than the level recommended by leading health
   experts. At the same time, California farmers are losing their markets
    to foreign competitors, rural unemployment is at an all time high and
                        family farms are struggling.

    On July 28, 2001, the Governor signed a bill to provide a $5 million
    state contribution to the Buy California program. This program would
       create a partnership between government and industry to promote
     consumption of California-grown agricultural products to California
      consumers, benefiting both public health and the state's economy.

                               [bc_2.jpg] Goal

      The goal of this program is to create a cross-commodity marketing
   campaign for agricultural products targeted at Californians. The focus
    would be on the concept of "California-grown" to communicate quality
   and local pride and to prompt increased consumer purchase of California
                                  products.

                                 Components

        A marketing agreement has been created to allow agricultural
   organizations to establish a marketing program under the guidance of an
   industry advisory board. The Board will contract with public relations
    and advertising agencies to develop an appropriate consumer awareness
      campaign. The marketing agreement will be re-evaluated after five
                                   years.

                    [bc_3.jpg] Partnership with Industry

     The state's $5 million contribution would be co-funded by non-state
   sources, including industry dollars. Industry is willing to contribute
      by direct assessment based on the value of various crops, special
        contributions for seasonal advertising that benefits specific
      commodities, and in-kind participation, by incorporating the "Buy
             California" theme into existing marketing programs.
