       A River Flood Outlook means that there is a potential for river
   flooding, but is not imminent. It shows the magnitude of river flooding
       that might occur within 48 hours for the highlighted basins and
                     affected counties; and, is based on
                       48 hours of forecasted rainfall
   which may or may not occur over these basins in timing and/or amounts.

   Minor Flooding Potential for some public inconvenience, but minimal or
                         no property damage likely.
    Moderate Flooding Potential for closure of secondary roads.  Transfer
        to higher elevation may be necessary to save property.  Some
                        evacuations may be required.
   Major Flooding Potential for extensive inundation and property damage.
   Usually characterized by the evacuation of people and livestock and the
                   closure of primary and secondary roads.
      Record Flooding Potential for the highest observed river stage or
     discharge at a given site during the period of record keeping. (Not
                    necessarily the highest known stage)
