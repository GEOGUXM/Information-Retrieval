                        Foot-and-Mouth Disease Alert

    The United States government is making a concerted effort to prevent
    the introduction into the United States of foot and mouth disease, a
       severe, highly communicable, viral disease of cattle and swine.
      Introduction of foot and mouth disease into this country would be
    disastrous to the American livestock industry and wildlife community.

   Secretary Mineta is asking that everyone planning trips to Europe help
    prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease by being informed about
      how the disease is transmitted and taking appropriate preventive
    measures. Although the disease is not considered a human health risk,
   humans can carry the virus on their clothing, shoes, body (particularly
    the throat and nasal passages) and personal items. The Department of
    Agriculture recommends that travelers to the United States: (1) avoid
     farms, sale barns, stockyards, animal laboratories, packing houses,
   zoos, fairs, or other animal facilities for 5 days prior to travel; (2)
   launder or dry clean all clothing and outerwear; and (3) avoid contact
      with livestock or wildlife for 5 days after arrival in the United
                                   States.

    The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has the lead in preventing
   the spread of this disease. They have established a toll free number to
    respond to questions (1-800-601-9327) and provided useful information
                      on this disease on their web site
       (http://www.usda.gov/special/fmd/fmd.html). Information on the
   precautions travelers should take to prevent an outbreak in the United
                 States is located on the USDA web site at:
               http://www.aphis.usda.gov/oa/fmd/travinfo.html.

   At the U.S. Department of Transportation, we are working with the U.S.
        Department of Agriculture to ensure that our partners in the
       transportation community are doing their part to educate their
            customers and employees about the preventive actions.
