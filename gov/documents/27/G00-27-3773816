        FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA CIVIL MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM
                             ELECTRONIC FILING SYSTEM

      Commencing on August 27, 2001, the First Judicial District of
      Pennsylvania instituted an Electronic Filing System for the electronic
      filing of Civil Mental Health Applications and Petitions. All Mental
      Health Applications or Petitions under Section 303, 304, 305 and 306 of
      the Mental Health Procedures Act of 1976, as amended, and Petitions for
      Review of the commitments and decisions of the Court appointed Mental
      Health Review Officers must be filed electronically.

      YOU CANNOT ACCESS THE MENTAL HEALTH ELECTRONIC FILING SYSTEM UNLESS THE
      FJD HAS AUTHORIZED YOU TO DO SO. Only those medical facilities involved
      in rendering treatment to Mental Health patients are authorized to
      receive access to the Electronic Filing System.

      For ease of access, and for training purposes, the following two (2)
      links are available TO AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY:

      DEMO SITE - Authorized Users can practice preparation of electronic
      Applications or Petitions on-line, and become familiar with the
      Electronic Filing System's functionality. Applications or Petitions
      completed on this site CANNOT be electronically filed.

      LIVE-SITE - Applications and Petitions are completed on-line and
      officially filed electronically with the Prothonotary's Office.

      For detailed Information about the Civil Mental Health Electronic
      Filing System, click this link.

      If you have any questions concerning Electronic Filing of Mental Health
      Applications or Petitions, email: dominic.rossi@courts.phila.gov.
