Paperwork Reduction Act

                                                                   Contact
                                                              Joe Schubart

   The Paperwork Reduction Act requires all federal agencies to obtain
   approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before
   collecting information from the public. Ways of collecting information
   include questionnaires, focus groups, telephone surveys, applications,
   performance reports, customer satisfaction surveys, studies and
   evaluations, interviews, forms, and any other means of requesting
   information from ten or more respondents.

   The public generally has two opportunities to comment on a proposed
   "information collection." Invitations for comment are published in the
   Federal Register and then on the ED Web site. During the first (60-day)
   period, comments on Department of Education-sponsored collections may
   be sent to ED's Paperwork Clearance Official, Joe Schubart. During the
   second (30-day) comment period, the OMB Desk Officers for Education,
   Lauren Wittenberg, Cristal Thomas and Karen Lee, reviews comments from
   the public.

   Pending and active information collections can be reviewed in the
   Department of Education Information Collection System (EDICS). EDICS
   also allows searches and provides access to reports and bulletins. In
   addition, OMB provides a list of information collections under review;
   reviews completed in the last 30 days; and expired approvals
   month-by-month. (This file is usually large and may require
   considerable download time.)
