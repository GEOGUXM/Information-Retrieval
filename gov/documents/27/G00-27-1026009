   Port of New York and New Jersey Water Level and Current
   Experimental Nowcast/Forecast Model System

   An experimental real-time nowcast/forecast model system for the Port of
   New York and New Jersey has been implemented and is being tested by the
   National Ocean Service, NOAA. It is designed to provide mariners and
   port mangers with up-to-minute nowcast and forecast water levels and
   currents throughout the harbor. The model system will be incorporated
   into NOS's Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System (PORTS) now
   operating in the harbor.

   The nowcast/forecast model system, developed by NOS's Coast Survey
   Development Laboratory (CSDL), uses the 3-dimensional Princeton Ocean
   Model (POM) for the harbor model. Boundary conditions are provided by
   an East Coast forecast model system, which is driven by an NWS weather
   forecast model. POM has an orthogonal curvilinear model grid covering
   New York Harbor from 74째 20'W to 73째 45'W and from 40째 24'N to 40째 52'N
   with a resolution varying from 150 m to 1000 m. A higher resolution
   sub-grid (green area), covering the Narrows and the navigation channels
   approaching Port Elizabeth, is embedded within and coupled to the
   larger grid, providing grid resolution as small as 70 m. The nested
   grid system provides more detailed information about current shears and
   eddies. The system model has been extensively calibrated with
   observations and has gone through a validation process to pass specific
   NOS criteria.

   The Port of New York/New Jersey Water Level and Current
   Nowcast/Forecast System is currently making nowcasts every hour and
   36-hour forecasts twice a day.
