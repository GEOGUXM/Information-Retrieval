   Windows 2000

   The CWS/CMS system currently employs Microsoft Windows 95 operating
   system for the presentation of the CWS/CMS application to the CWS user
   community. As of 12/31/2001 Microsoft will no longer support Windows 95
   and the project will migrate to Windows 2000 as the new operating
   system. Below you will find the phases of the implementation cycle:
     * On June 9, 2001 code was delivered that installed the Windows 2000
       infrastructure required to build the workstation images and
       installation procedures used to attach the workstation to the
       CWS/CMS environment. This is the first phase in preparation for the
       conversion of all CWS/CMS workstations and servers to the Windows
       2000 operating system.
     * Replacement of the current IBM OS/2 Warp server platform to servers
       that support the Windows 2000 operating system. This will be the
       second phase and will reduce the number of servers with fewer, more
       powerful servers to improve CWS/CMS application availability.
     * Migration of the workstation from Windows 95 to Windows 2000. This
       will be the third phase and will continue to provide CWS with the
       growth and flexibility capabilities required to maintain operations
       into the future.
