  General Answers:

     * What is SeaDAS ?

   SeaDAS is a comprehensive image analysis package for processing,
       displaying and analyzing all SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide
       Field-of-view Sensor) data products and ancillary data. SeaWiFS
       data products include L0, L1A, L1B, L1A-Browse, L2, L2-Browse, L3
       Binned, L3 Standard Mapped Image (SMI) and L3-Browse products.
       Ancillary data include Wind, Pressure, Precipitable H20 and OZONE
       data from NCEP. The source of the ozone data is EP/TOMS.
       In addition, SeaDAS can also process OCTS, MOS and CZCS data.
       SeaDAS can only display (but not process AVHRR SST data).
       The SeaDAS source code is FREE and available via FTP. SeaDAS is
       supported by the NASA ocean biochemistry program under UPN
       S79-11-03-20 to C. R. Mcclain (P.I).

     * What are SeaWiFS Level-0 (L0), Level-1A, Level-1B, 2, 3, SMI and
       BROWSE data ?

   L0: Initial data from the SeaWiFS sensor. Reconstructed, unprocessed
       instrument/payload data at full resolution.
       L1A: Reconstructed, unprocessed instrument data at full resolution,
       including radiometric and geometric calibration coefficients and
       georeferencing parameters (i.e., platform ephemeris) computed and
       appended, but not applied to the L0 data.
       L1B: At-sensor radiances derived by applying the sensor calibration
       to the Level 1A counts at the same resolution and location as the
       Level 1A data. (Only available with SeaDAS, not available from the
       Goddard DAAC).
       L2: Derived environmental variables at the same resolution and
       location as the L1 data.
       L3 Binned: Variables mapped on uniform space-time grid scales,
       usually with some completeness and consistency.
       L3 SMI: The Standard Mapped Image product is the image
       representation of the L3 binned data. The product is a byte-valued
       two dimensional array (4096 x 2048) representing an equidistant
       cylindrical projection of the globe.
       BROWSE - In general, the  browse products are subsampled raster
       images of the L1A, L2 and L3 SMI files:

     * L1A browse is a Quasi-true-color composite of Bands 6,5 and 1 (ie
       670nm, 555nm and 412nm) with a Rayleigh correction applied to
       remove haze
     * L2 browse is a subsampled raster image of the Level-2 "chlorophyll
       a concentration" product
     * L3 browse is a subsampled raster image of the Level-3 SMI
       "chlorophyll a concentration" product.

   See the data products web page under the SeaWiFS project for more
   detailed information.


     How to order SeaWiFS data ?
   The NASA Goddard DAAC will archive and distribute all SeaWiFS L1A (LAC,
       GAC, and BROWSE) data, L2 (GAC and BROWSE) data, and L3 (Binned,
       SMI, and BROWSE) data. The data will be available for the public
       during the first 90 days after the launch. After that, only
       authorized users may access the DAAC for data. Check the SeaWiFS
       home page to get information about how to apply for an authorized
       user account.

     * Can SeaDAS process MODIS, CZCS or AVHRR data ?

   SeaDAS 4.1 can only process SeaWiFS, OCTS, MOS and CZCS data. SeaDAS
       can display (but not process) AVHRR SST, and MODIS Ocean data.
       SeaDAS has no plans to provide processing capabilities for MODIS
       data. In the future, SeaDAS may include the capability to process
       and or display data from other satellites.

     * Why support just SGI, SUN and PC/Linux platforms?

   The SeaWiFS Project is not able to support a full suite of machines
       with verified software. When the SeaWiFS Project started, it was
       determined that the vast majority of prospective users utilized
       either SUN or SGI workstations. The SeaWiFS Project uses SGI
       workstations in their production processing environment. SUN was
       the most widely-used platform by prospective users.
       The SeaWiFS Project decided to support providing a PC/Linux version
       of SeaDAS once PC's became powerful enough to handle processing
       SeaWiFS data. There are not any plans to support the Windows or NT
       operating systems.
       We encourage groups to provide "ports" to other platforms. We would
       be able to distribute but not verify any user-provided ports.

     * What is the difference between SeaDAS and the available SeaWiFS
       Project code ?

   SeaDAS is a stand-alone package meant for individuals or groups who
       would like to generate and/or analyze SeaWiFS data. SeaDAS is more
       general than the SeaWiFS data processing system and provides
       interfaces which allow the user to control the input parameters of
       the processing programs.
       The SeaWiFS Project code, although designed to be as portable as
       possible, will nevertheless be dependent on many hardware
       (graphics, disks, network,nodes) and software (database, SGI/GL,
       etc.) specific to the SeaWiFS data processing system. It is a
       production system designed for data types, data rates,
       reprocessings, computer systems, and manpower that are beyond the
       requirements of SeaWiFS data users.
       It is important to note that SeaDAS will be capable of producing
       SeaWiFS Level-1, -2, and -3 products identical to those generated
       by the production system given the same input files and parameters.
       The defaults used by the SeaDAS programs will match the parameters
       used by the SeaWiFS production processing system.

     * What is the difference between HRPT and LAC data?

   HRPT data and LAC data have the same format and the same resolution.
       They are different, however. HRPT data is broadcast continuously by
       the satellite for reception by the HRPT stations. It is lost unless
       it is received by a ground station or recorded. Each HRPT pass will
       (at GSFC) be kept as one image. So HRPT scenes can range from very
       short (if the satellite is at the horizon of the station) to very
       long (several minutes).
       LAC (Local Area Coverage) data is actually RECORDED HRPT data
       downlinked with the GAC data and covers a very small area. LAC data
       for calibration will be very short (<1 min) to cover the ground
       location of interest and cannot be very long (the total LAC
       recording time is about 10 min). Each time the recorder is turned
       on & off, for whatever length of time, it will constitute one LAC
       scene. The highest priority for using LAC recording space will be
       for calibration purposes. People needing LAC that is unavailable
       from an HRPT station should request it from the SeaWiFS Project
       (Chuck McClain).

  Specific Answers:

     * How do I get SeaDAS to automatically place my windows?

   SeaDAS will automatically place your windows for you conveniently if
       you allow it to. You must tell your window manager to allow
       applications to place their own windows. To do this, you must:

     * Modify your .Xresources or .Xdefaults file to tell your window
       manager to allow applications programs to determine window
       placement.
     * Restart your window manager.

   Required in order for SeaDAS window positioning to work at all:

     Mwm*clientAutoPlace: False Turn off automatic window placement by
     window manager

     Mwm*interactivePlacement: False Turn off user interactively
     positioning all windows

   Not required, but can be convenient:

     Mwm*positionIsFrame: True Widget positions given by applications
     programs include the frame (NOTE: If this is not on, then the window
     may overlap each other near the frames).

     Mwm*positionOnScreen: False Don't let any windows get positioned off
     the screen.

   NOTE: Replace Mwm with 4Dwm in the following lines if you're running
   4Dwm.


     How do I change the background color of SeaDAS windows?

     * Modify your .Xresources or .Xdefaults file to include a line
       similar to the line below. (Use unix command showrgb to see
       available colors)
     * Update your resource database using command xrdb -merge .Xresources
     * Start up SeaDAS.

   Idl*background: peachpuff


     How do I change my SeaDAS widget font?
   To select a widget font for your current SeaDAS session only:

          + Interatively: Use the interactive command sdwfont found in the
            SeaDAS Main Menu under Utility.
          + Command-mode: Use the command setdef_wfont.

   Your default SeaDAS widget font is set in file
   $SEADAS/config/seadas.env in the environment variable SDSWFONT.

   a) To change the default widget font for everyone on your system, you
   can change the value of SDSWFONT in the configuration file
   $SEADAS/config/seadas.env.

   b.) To change the default for yourself permanently, set your own value
   for SDSWFONT after sourcing seadas.env in your .login file:. Example:
source /usr3/seadas/config/seadas.env
setenv SDSWFONT 'lucidasans-bold-10'

     How do I change the default data range scalings for SeaWiFS products?
   The default scalings are looked for first in file .seadas_defaults in
       the users home directory and secondly in file
       $SEADAS/config/seadas_defaults.
       To change scaling defaults for everyone running SeaDAS on your
       system, you can modify the file $SEADAS/config/seadas_defaults .
       To change scaling defaults for only your own SeaDAS sessions, copy
       the system defaults file to your home directory and modify it.
       cp $SEADAS/config/seadas_defaults ~/.seadas_defaults
       NOTES: If an entry is commented out or removed, the default will be
       to scale the product to it's local min/max data range. Also,
       currently, product names containing blanks are not supported.

     * How do I kill a SeaDAS session if it hangs?

   Look for your SeaDAS process ID and kill it. It will appear in your
       main SeaDAS menu widget. If your main widget is not up, then issue
       the following command to find your idl session and kill the
       corresponding process id.
       % ps -ef | grep idl (search for your idl session)
       % kill nnnn (kill the process id associated with your idl session)
       Problem 1: An error message occurs similar to 'Xlib: unexpected
       async reply ('sequence 9x56a2)!', followed by IDL hanging. This
       problem occurs infrequently and is unreproducable. Currently the
       cause is undetermined and there is no known way of working around
       this problem. RSI is working on resolving this problem.

     * How do I create a nice-looking SeaWiFS L1A true color image?

   To create a nice-looking true color image from SeaWiFS L1A data, use
       the browse function found in the Process->SeaWiFS menu.  This will
       allow you to create a L1A browse image at full resolution if
       desired.  To create an image at full resolution, set the X & Y
       sampling rates to 1.
       The Load->True option in the general display program does not give
       very clear results for true color since the Rayleigh correction has
       not been applied.  The browse program applies the Rayleigh
       correction when creating the L1A browse file.

   Known Problems/Anomalies/Limitations - Detailed answers
     * SGI/IRIX 6.2: May have error running l1agen. Need SGI patch 2435
       (previously 2170).

   * Install SGI patch 2170 if l1agen fails to run with the following
       error message:
       namelist read: variable not in namelist
       apparent state: unit 18 named orbctl.nl
       last format: namelist io
       Unit 18 is a sequential unformatted external file
       *** Execution Terminated (119) ***    (This is a FORTRAN compiler
       bug which causes a run-time error.)

     * Binning resolution currently fixed at either 4km or 9km bins.

   Currently the l3bin program will  create either 4km or 9km bins. This
       is a known constraint. The SeaWiFS Project has plans to make the
       bin size completely variable in the future.

     * l3bin program is currently dependent on 2-line elements files being
       kept up-to-date.
  DATADAYS: Error calculating start day.

                   ERROR

  RECENT NORAD TWO LINE ELEMENT FILE NOT FOUND
                FOR SEASTAR:
  File does not exist or most recent file
           exceeds 30 days old
        Obtain updated element file
       Currently, the l3bin program is dependent on the 2-line elements
       files, in directory $SEADAS/data/seawifs/norad, being kept fairly
       up-to-date. We have plans to eliminate the need for this program to
       use these files. However, currently it will be necessary to keep
       these files updated. They can be downloaded from:
       ftp://samoa.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/two-line-elements. You may want to
       set up a cron job to download these automatically every day.

     * Load SEAPAK CZCS - Does not handle map projected SEAPAK files.

   Currently the display program is not able to navigate SEAPAK map
       projected files. One option is to map project the original
       unprojected SEAPAK file within SeaDAS.

     * IDL 5.0.x bug: HDF_SD_ATTRFIND: Failed to Find the Attribute: xxxx

   You may see the following, or similar messages displayed when loading
       files into the display program. This happens most noticeably with
       SeaDAS Mapped files:
   HDF_SD_ATTRFIND: Failed to Find the Attribute: xxxx
       where xxxx may be any number of things such as Parameter, Slope,
       Intercept, etc.
       These messages are not errors and should not be printed out.
       However, in IDL 5.0.x it was impossible to suppress these messages.
       They come from internal IDL HDF routines which did not respond to
       normal IDL error-handling controls. This problem is fixed in IDL
       5.1.

     * IDL 5.0.3 has a bug putting on continents.

   IDL 5.0.3 has a bug when putting on continents. You can see this
       problem by doing the following tests:
1) IDL> map_set,0.0,180.0,LIMIT=[-90.0, 0.0, 90.0, 359.0], /continents

   ; For IDL 5.0.3, both North and South America are missing!

2) IDL> map_set, 0.0,180.0,LIMIT=[-70.0,-359.0,70,0.0],/continents,/MERC

   ; For IDL 5.0.3, Australia is now missing!
       This problem is only known for IDL 5.0.3. It does not occur in IDL
       4.0.1, IDL 5.0 or IDL 5.1. RSI acknowleges this problem and
       supplied a patched version of map_continents.pro. This patch is
       also available on seadas's anonymous ftp-site in directory
       outgoing/idl5.03_bug.

     * IDL 5.0.x has a bug regarding resizing windows.

   IDL 5.0.x has a bug regarding resizing windows. This behavior does not
       occur when running under IDL 4.0.1 or IDL 5.1. This behavior is
       evident in SeaDAS when attempting to resize plot windows. The plots
       behave properly if the window is resized to be larger, however it
       does not behave properly if the window is resized to be smaller.

     * IDL 5.1 & 5.2 have a map projection bug involving p0lon and /fill
       options.

   Some values of p0lon when using the /fill keyword when mapping can
       cause IDL to bomb as in the following example.  If the /fill is
       turned off, or if p0lon is set to be the exact center of the area
       limits, then the problem does not occur.  RSI has been notified
       about this problem.
       IDL> limit=[40,-71.5, 45, -65.0]
       IDL> window, xsize=300, ysize=300
       IDL> p0lon = -66.55
       IDL>  map_set,0.0, p0lon, limit=limit
       IDL> map_continents, /hires,/fill_continents
       % Internal error: Border sort.
