FEATURE:

   Optimized Image Compression

   Researchers at NASA have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art of
   digital image compression. From cable TV to high speed copiers, a wide
   array of today's electronic imaging products utilize the power of
   digital imaging. NASA Ames has developed DCTune, a computer technology
   that significantly improves efficiencies in storage and transmission of
   documents, pictures and videos. This technology is compatible with
   industry compression standards known as JPEG and MPEG. DCTune can be
   used as add-on modules of software to existing imaging workstation
   software or imaging devices, or as add-on functions to existing
   microchip designs.
