                             Joint Announcement

                                                    February 5, 2001 Tokyo

                      1ST JAPAN-US GPS PLENARY MEETING

   On February 5, 2001 in Tokyo, the Government of Japan and the
   Government of the United States of America held the inaugural session
   of the Japan-US GPS Plenary meeting which was convened to discuss the
   Global Positioning System (GPS). The session was organized to implement
   ideas originally outlined in a Joint Statement regarding cooperation in
   the use of the GPS which was issued on September 22, 1998 in New York
   City by the then heads of the two Governments. The purpose of the
   meeting was to study and discuss important matters on the use of the
   GPS standard positioning service.

   During the meeting, the representatives of both of the Governments
   examined and discussed various GPS related issues from the perspective
   of both the current status of the program as well as where the program
   may go in the future.

   Both of the Governments reconfirmed principles originally outlined by
   the Joint Statement of September 22, 1998, especially the principle
   that the U.S. Government continues to provide the GPS Standard
   Positioning Service for peaceful civil, commercial, and scientific use
   on a continuous, worldwide basis, free of direct user fees.

   Both of the Governments will continue to work closely to promote the
   use of GPS Standard Positioning Service as a worldwide positioning,
   navigation, and timing standard; to facilitate the exchange of
   information on the development of aviation and maritime GPS
   augmentation systems; to avoid harmful interference between GPS and
   other services; to ensure effective and appropriate use of spectrum for
   GPS modernization; and to prevent misuse of GPS and its augmentations.
