                                    Asbestos Facility Inventories


   In accordance with GSA policy, the Heartland Region has had inspections
   performed for asbestos materials throughout the years in all
   Federally-owned facilities. Inspections conducted over the past 10
   years have followed EPA AHERA guidance, been performed by
   State/EPA-certified inspectors and are intended to be updated every 3
   years.
   Each inspection records:
     * the location and types of asbestos present
     * the quantities and condition of asbestos present, and
     * the results of any asbestos bulk sampling conducted

   Included in this database of information are also cursory surveys
   conducted by the Social Security Administration in some of their
   offices. Most recent inspections also include AutoCad drawings redlined
   to illustrate the locations of asbestos-containing materials. Copies of
   these drawings may be obtained by contacting the Safety & Environmental
   Team .
