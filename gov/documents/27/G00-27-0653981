   March 15, 2000 An Overview of the NASA Electronic, Electrical, and
   Electromechanical Parts Information Management System (EPIMS) S.
   Waterbury ABSTRACT The Electrical, Electronic, and Electromechanical
   (EEE) Parts Information Management System (EPIMS) is a comprehensive
   data system, called to support the management of EEE parts for all NASA
   projects. EPIMS 1.0 became operational in February of 1994, and
   implements a core set of functions. EPIMS 2.0 was released in March of
   2000, and introduced file upload and parts list check-in, among other
   features. Keywords: components, database, electronics, parts, PDM. 1.0
   PURPOSE AND SCOPE The purpose of EPIMS is to provide automated
   engineering information management for EEE parts reliability, quality
   assurance, design support, and cost control with an agency-wide,
   integrated, on-line data system accessible to all NASA projects,
   contractors, and supporting personnel. The scope of EPIMS includes
   storage of and access to EEE part selection, availability,
   qualification, usage, test, field history, and inventory data;
   electronic submittal of contractual data requirements; and automated
   support for parts management tasks for all NASA projects and for the
   NASA Electronic Parts and Packaging (NEPP) Program. An Overview of the

   OBJECTIVES EPIMS is an information resource designed to be accessible
   to all NASA Centers, projects, and cooperating activities. The system
   objectives are to provide: * sharing of parts and design data among all
   NASA projects; * agency-wide coordination of EEE parts management
   activities; * electronic capture of data, enabling - elimination of
   duplicate data entry and - minimization and eventual elimination of
   paper systems; * a knowledge base of parts technical expertise; *
   integration of NASA EEE parts management with system design activities.
   3.0 POLICIES AND STANDARDS The policies or standards relevant to EPIMS
   include both domain standards and policies (NASA EEE parts policies)
   and metadata standards (system and software standards). 3.1 EEE Parts
   Domain All policy documents are cited in Section 2, Reference
   Documentation. EPIMS is designed to support the Data Item Descriptions
   (DID's) specified in the Electrical, Electronic, and Electromechanical
   (EEE) Parts Management and Control Requirements for NASA Space Flight
   Programs, NHB 5300.4(1F) (July 1989), which defines the NASA
   requirements for EEE parts management and control for NASA spaceflight
   projects. 3.2 System, Software, and Metadata Standards The system,
   software, and metadata standards applicable to EPIMS are: * The POSIX
   (IEEE 1003.1, FIPS 151-1) operating system standard (a NIST Application
   Portability Profile standard); * ISO 8879, the Standard Generalized
   Mark-up Language (SGML); * IEC Draft International Standard 1360-1,
   "Principles and Methods for Defining Standard Data Element Types with
   Associated Classification Scheme for Electric Components;" * ISO 10303,
   or "STEP", "Product Data Representation and Exchange," an international
   standard for the exchange of product life cycle data. POSIX and STEP
   are integral to the EPIMS concept. The EPIMS server runs on a
   POSIX-compliant Operating System (Solaris) and utilizes POSIX standard
   scripting languages in implementing EPIMS application modules. Input
   formats, output formats, and a repository structure based on the ISO
   10303 (STEP) standard will be incorporated in future releases of EPIMS.

   ARCHITECTURE 6.0 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 6.1 Concept: Design Intent of
   EPIMS The intent of EPIMS is to provide a repository for EEE parts data
   that will enable a tighter coupling between the activities of EEE parts
   engineers and NASA designers. Quick access to current data is essential
   to enable the parts engineers to support designers on the part
   selection and qualification issues that arise early in the formulation
   of designs for flight hardware. The goal of EPIMS will provide
   "one-stop shopping" for the management of project EEE parts information
   for NASA designers, parts engineers, and project personnel, and to
   integrate that information with reference data and documents (e.g., the
   data maintained by the NEPP program) and other project data, such as
   drawings, design models, and project documents. 6.2 Implementation: Web
   Client / Server with CGI Database Interface The system architecture
   concept for EPIMS is based on a simple Web client-server structure. The
   EPIMS application consists of a database, interface applications, and a
   Web server. All data is served to the user by way of the user's Web
   browser, using context-sensitive, active HTML pages. Users connect to
   EPIMS by logging on to the EPIMS Web server via Basic Authentication
   (userid/password) and access the EPIMS database via CGI applications
   with script-generated HTML forms interfaces. An Overview of the NASA
