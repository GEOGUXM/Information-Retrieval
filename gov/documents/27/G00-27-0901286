                           Technology and Training

    Coastal and Marine Management Program (CAMMP) Information System OCRM
       is developing a new national on-line information system designed
       to:

     * Streamline state and federal grant application and performance
       reporting tasks
     * Improve state and federal CZM data collection and analysis
       capabilities
     * Provide a consistent national database of CZM related information
     * Improve accessibility to technical information produced by our
       partners

   The CAMMP system will allow state coastal management programs and
   National Estuarine Research Reserves to perform most of their
   grant-related functions over the Internet. This includes submitting
   grant applications and performance reports, and requesting changes to
   approved awards. All data submitted will becomes part of a database
   where it can be accessed, searched and printed.

   Access to CAMMP is currently available only to our state partners.
   Eventually the system will be accessible to the public for data
   searches.
