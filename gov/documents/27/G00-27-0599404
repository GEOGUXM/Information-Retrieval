CASE STUDY WRF model runs from NSSL

   CASE STUDY OF 11 JUNE 2001 EVENT: RUN WITH NEW VERSION OF KF

   Daily, real-time runs of the new Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)
   model are being produced at NSSL on an 8 processor SGI02 model domain
   and resolution are very similar to those of our Eta model output .

   The current WRF configuration is:

     Modified KF convective parameterization

     MRF PBL scheme

     Lin et al. microphysics

     RRTM longwave radiation

     Dudhia shortwave radiation

     Thermal diffusion surface physics

     34 km grid length, 31 vertical levels

     Time step 180s

   Output fields include surface pressure/temperature, total
   precipitation, convective precipitation, CAPE/CIN, 850/700/500/250 mb
   maps. Plots have been updated to create a larger image on screen for
   easier viewing. Updated May 23, 2001 by LJW

   As with our local Eta model runs, initial and boundary conditions are
   obtained from interpolation of the routinely available 80km/45layer Eta
   Model fields obtained from EMC/NCEP.

   This version of WRF and NSSL's Realtime runs of the 32km Eta all use
   the same version of the Kain-Fritsch convective parameterization.

   We share this busy workstation with daily runs of the MM5 including
   short range ensembles. Check out those pages also.
