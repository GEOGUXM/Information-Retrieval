              Sanctuary Explorer Describes Life Below the Waves

   Cathy Sakas, education coordinator for the Gray's Reef National Marine
   Sanctuary, and five other aquanauts spent nine days in Aquarius, an
   undersea laboratory off Key Largo in the Florida Keys National Marine
   Sanctuary. During her underwater adventure, Sakas studied corals that
   had become encrusted and colonized by algae.

   The September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the United States leaves a
   grieving nation joined together in a common bond to commemorate the
   dead and comfort the living.

   We at the National Marine Sanctuary System were especially touched by
   this tragedy when we learned that among the victims of the hijacking
   and suicide crash of American Airlines Flight 77 were students,
   teachers, and sanctuary partners bound for a week-long field trip to
   Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.

   Olympic Coast Research cruise

   Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary staff and partners aboard the
   R/V Velero IV. One of the deepest dives ever in the sanctuary was made
   during this year's mission.

   A Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary research team, monitoring the
   effects of fiber-optic cables on the ocean floor, reaped additional
   benefits during a recent 16-day cruise. Using Delta, a two-person
   submersible, scientists conducted 55 dives throughout the mission.
   During one dive, explorers achieved one of the deepest dive ever in the
   sanctuary, reaching a depth of just over 1,000 feet.
