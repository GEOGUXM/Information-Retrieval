   There are more things in Heaven and on Earth
       Than are dreamt of in your philosophy
              --  William Shakespeare

   These pages are an attempt to convey my work related interests to
   whomever it may concern. The running theme of my work so far is the
   interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere. That puts it
   kind of simply. When you really start to think about the problem,
   land-atmosphere interactions influence the relative short time scales
   (the diurnal cycle), longer time scales (the annual cycles) and the
   longest of time scales (climate and climate change). As you will see,
   if you read any farther than the first page, I've tried to dabble in
   different scales.
   Sorry, there isn't much information on my personal life here (and
   contrary to popular belief, I do have one). For that, you'll have to
   talk to me in person.
