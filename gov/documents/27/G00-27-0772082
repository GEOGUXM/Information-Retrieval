   resulted in a maximum gage height of 5.70 ft and an instantaneous peak
   flow of 864 ft3/s. The sediment samplers were recovered on February 15,
   2000. Two samplers at site 3 and one at site 2 were found to have been
   destroyed or were missing, resulting in retrieval of 9 of the 12
   samplers. Streamflows were estimated at sites 1, 2, and 4 by
   multiplying the flow measured at USGS gaging station 02145642 (site 3)
   by the ratio of the drainage areas of the selected site and the gaging
   station. Suspended-sediment loads were calculated for three stages of
   the rising limb of the hydrograph and are listed in table 2. The
   maximum suspended-sediment load calculated was 2,120 tons/d during a
   flow of 795 ft3/s at site 4, (table 2). At station 02145642 (site 3), a
   suspended-sediment load of 402 tons/d was calculated for a flow of 151
   ft3/s. These suspended-sediment load calculations are an instantaneous
   single day estimation and are not meant to infer yearly estimates. As
   previously stated, Gissendanner (1994) calculated suspended-sediment
   loads at gaging station 02145642 to be 1,680 and 652 tons/d, for flows
   of 520 and 500 ft3/ s, respectively. The distribution of
   sediment-particle size ranged from 65.9 to 92.5 percent finer than
   0.063 mm during this study (table 2). Bed-sediment loads were not
   calculated for this study. Bed-Sediment Data Bed-sediment samples were
   collected on December 3, 1999, from four locations in the study area:
   one in the lower reach of Crowders Creek and three in the cove (fig.
   2). These samples were analyzed for 44 trace elements, 29
   organochlorine pesticides, pesticide degradates and polychlorinated
