SUMMARY OF MAJOR FINDINGS

  Surface-Water Highlights

   The environment in southern Florida is being degraded by human
   activities. Native biota have been reduced greatly in abundance and
   diversity by drainage, development, alteration of water flows,
   degradation of water quality, and by continuing invasions of exotic
   species.The Everglades ecosystem, which is adapted to water that has an
   extremely low phosphorus concentration, is being altered by
   agricultural activities that produce high levels of phosphorus in
   water. Nutrient loading in the major rivers is contributing to
   over-enrichment of Lake Okeechobee and estuaries such as Charlotte
   Harbor. Mercury has accumulated in Everglades game fish, and
   consumption of the fish poses a potential human health risk. Mercury
   has accumulated in the Everglades food web because natural conditions
   and human influences enhance methylation of mercury to its organic form
   and because high atmospheric mercury deposition rates (among the
   highest in the Nation) sustain mercury methylation.

   Federal and State agencies and environmental groups agree that parts of
   southern Florida should be restored to predevelopment conditions.
   Restoration will require massive changes in the water-management system
   to restore predevelopment drainage patterns, improve water quality, and
   protect native biota.

   Major findings on water quality and biology from this study:
     * Concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) at the Southern Florida
       (SOFL) National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program sites were
       above Everglades background levels and exceeded the U.S.
       Environmental Protection Agencys (USEPA) Everglades water-quality
       standard of 0.01 milligram per liter (mg/L). A major source of the
       high TP is fertilizer from agriculture.
     * Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in southern
       Florida water were relatively high compared with those in other
       waters of the Nation. High DOC concentrations provide food for
       bacteria to grow, reduce light penetration in the water, and
       enhance transport and cycling of pesticides and trace elements such
       as mercury.
     * Pesticides were detected in almost all SOFL samples. Most
       concentrations were below aquatic-life criteria; however, the
       criteria do not address potential effects of mixtures of pesticides
       and their degradation products, which were common in the samples.

   Urban, agricultural, Native American, public lands and other important
      features in the Southern Florida NAWQA Study Unit (McPherson and
                               Halley, 1996).


     * Organochlorine pesticides, such as DDT and its degradation
       products, are still prevalent in bottom sediment and fish tissue at
       the SOFL sites, even though most uses of these compounds have been
       discontinued in recent decades. The mobilization of these
       pesticides by the reflooding of Everglades farm lands could lead to
       food-web contamination.
     * Of 21 NAWQA basins nationwide, the Everglades has the second
       highest ratio of methylmercury to mercury in sediment.This
       enrichment in methyl-mercury enhances mercury uptake by the biota.
     * The frequency of external anomalies (lesions, ulcers, and tumors)
       on fish collected at two SOFL agricultural canal sites was in the
       top 25 percent of 144 NAWQA sites sampled nationwide. Anomalies can
       be indications that fish are stressed by contamination.
     * Exotic animals and plants are a threat to native biota. Ten of the
       54 exotic fish species established in the region were collected at
       the SOFL sites. Several herbicides used to control exotic plants
       were detected in surface water.


   Major Influences on Surface Water and Ecology

        * Drainage modifications and wetland destruction.
        * Runoff from agricultural and urban areas.
        * High concentrations of DOC and its effects on the transport of
          mercury and the attenuation of light.
        * Deliberate or accidental release of exotic species.

  Ground-Water Highlights

   In much of the SOFL region, ground water in the surficial aquifers,
   such as the Biscayne aquifer, is of good quality and usually meets
   Federal and State drinking-water quality standards. Contaminants are
   usually in low concentrations, presumably because of rapid flushing and
   recharge as a result of high annual rainfall (about 55 inches) and
   shallow aquifers and porous limestone that allow the easy interchange
   of surface and ground water. However, because of the shallow aquifers
   and porous limestone, ground water is vulnerable to surface
   contamination and to saltwater intrusion.


   Major findings on ground-water quality from this study include the
   following:

     * Nitrate concentrations were below the drinking-water standard (10
       mg/L) in 108 SOFL wells (Biscayne and other surfical aquifers),
       except for two shallow wells in the unnamed surficial aquifer of
       the citrus area.
     * Pesticides were detected in more than 85 percent of the SOFL wells
       and beneath every type of land use studied, but no concentrations
       exceeded any USEPA or State of Florida drinking-water standard.
     * Pesticides detected in shallow ground water were associated with
       specific land uses. For example, the herbicides bromacil and
       norflurazon were detected almost exclusively in citrus areas.
       Metolachlor and simazine were common in mixed agricultural areas
       near the southern Everglades.
     * Volatile organic carbon compounds (VOCs) commonly were detected in
       water from shallow and deep wells in the Biscayne aquifer.
       Concentrations of one industrial VOC, vinyl chloride, exceeded the
       USEPA maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 2 micrograms per liter
       (µ/L) for drinking water in two samples.
     * Radon-222 radioactivity exceeded the proposed MCL (300 picocuries
       per liter ([pCi/L]) in the majority of samples from the Biscayne
       aquifer, including untreated water from the public-supply wells.


   Major Influences on Ground Water

        * Porous, shallow limestone aquifers overlain by thin layers of
          sandy, permeable soils.
        * Water-management practices involving canals, pumps, gates, locks,
          and saltwater-control structures.
        * Agricultural and urban land-use practices and aquatic-weed control.
