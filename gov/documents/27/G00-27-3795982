                       Welcome to the home page of the
                           surface theory program
                       headed by M.A. Van Hove at the
                    Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
                      of the University of California.
        We do theory and computation for surface science experiments
       to determine the atomistic structure of surfaces and interfaces
                  by means of LEED, PD / PH and STM / AFM.
