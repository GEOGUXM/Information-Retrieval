                       Groundfish Survey Field Videos
    (The quality of how the streaming videos appear on the AFSC web site
       depends partly on your connection speed, the cpu speed of your
   computer, and the version of software you're using to view the videos.
    The slower the connection speed and computing power and the older the
                software, the less likely a quality image. )
