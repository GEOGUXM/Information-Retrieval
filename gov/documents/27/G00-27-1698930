                            Time Capsule Opening

   On June 28, 1960, memories for the fu [tcplate.jpg] ture were buried at
   what would be the entrance to the current Fort Worth Center building.
   Instructions on this time capsule indicated that it was to be opened in
   the year 2000.

   On Saturday, June 24, 2000, at 10:00 a.m., the time capsule was opened
   and its contents revealed.  What items were found, sent to us by the
   personnel who worked here 40 years ago?

   Following the ceremony a picnic lunch was served.  Many former and
   current Fort Worth Center personnel attended the festivities as well as
   FAA dignitaries and congressional staffers.
