       Welcome to the home page for infrared programs at the National
       Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  We are
       located in Upton, NY on Long Island, approximately 60 miles east of New
       York City.

       Synchrotron infrared science at the NSLS utilizes frequency ranges from
       the near- through the far-infrared regions and encompasses applications
       in the physical, electronic, surface, geological, environmental,
       biological, and medical sciences.

       We currently have 6 operational infrared beamlines on the VUV ring.
       Each beamline is managed by a participating research team and
       specializes in one or more areas of infrared science.

       The National Synchrotron Light Source is a national user facility
       sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy.  More than a thousand
       scientists worldwide visit the NSLS each year to perform experiments.
       Access to the infrared facilities at the NSLS is available in several
       ways, the most common of which is the peer-reviewed General User
       Proposal System. For more information on submitting a General User
       proposal, or other means of access to beamtime, contact any of the
       beamline spokespersons for details.
