    HOTELS

   Below is a list of hotels, however it is not exhaustive.  Some are
   within walking distance, others a short drive to NIH.  We recommend you
   make your reservations early, as October will be a very busy month for
   hotels in the Bethesda area.  Also, please note that parking is very
   limited at NIH.  There is a metro station on the NIH campus.


   For rooms quoted in MD, add 12% tax

   Government rates will not be available to all attendees.
