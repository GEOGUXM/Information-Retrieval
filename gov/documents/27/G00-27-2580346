   IN THE United States Court of Appeals FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
   CIRCUIT Nos. 00-5212, 5213 MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellant,
   v. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and STATE OF NEW YORK, et al.,
   Plaintiffs-Appellees. ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
   FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA MICROSOFT CORPORATION'S RESPONSE TO
   MOTIONS FOR LEAVE TO PARTICIPATE AS AMICI CURIAE Pursuant to the
   Court's October 26, 2000 Order, appellant Microsoft Corporation
   ("Microsoft") hereby responds to the various motions filed by those
   seeking leave to participate as amici curiae. The Association for
   Competitive Technology ("ACT") and the Computing Technology Industry
   Association ("CompTIA") have sought permission to file a single joint
   brief in support of Microsoft's appeal. Both parties to No. 00-5212
   have consented to participation by ACT and CompTIA as amici pursuant to
   Circuit Rule 29(b), and their motion should be granted. Although
   Microsoft is willing to consent to the filing of a single joint brief
   by entities supporting appellees, Microsoft opposes the eight motions
   seeking separate amicus participation. First, Microsoft's
   competitors-acting in their own name or under the guise of various
   "trade associations"-should not be allowed to file multiple 25-page
   amicus briefs. If allowed to participate at all, these entities should
   be required to file a single joint brief, as they were "strongly
   encouraged" to do by the Court's October 11, 2000 Order. Any other
   outcome would be unfair to Microsoft and unduly burdensome for the
   Court. Second, efforts by organizations or private individuals with no
   particularized interest in this case (or the software industry
   generally) to participate as amici should simply be denied, regardless
   of which side they support. ARGUMENT "An amicus brief should normally
   be allowed when a party is not represented competently or is not
   represented at all, when the amicus has an interest in some other case
   that may be affected by the decision in the present case (though not
   enough affected to entitle the amicus to intervene and become a party
   in the present case), or when the amicus has unique information or
   perspective that can help the court beyond the help that the lawyers
   for the parties are able to provide." Ryan v. CFTC, 125 F.3d 1062, 1063
   (7th Cir. 1997) (Posner, C.J., in chambers). Four of the pending
   motions-those filed by America Online, Inc. ("AOL"), the Computer &
   Communications Industry Association ("CCIA"), the Project to Promote
   Competition & Innovation in the Digital Age ("ProComp") and the
   Software and Information Industry Association ("SIIA")-should be
   denied, or granted only on condition that these entities file a single
   joint brief. The other four motions-those filed by the Association for
   Objective Law ("TAFOL") and the Center for the Moral Defense of - 2 -
   Capitalism ("CMDC"), Lee A. Hollaar, Carl Lundgren and Laura Bennett
   Peterson-should be denied because the movants have made no showing that
   they have a particularized interest in this case that warrants their
   participation as amici. A. If Allowed to Participate as Amici,
   Microsoft's Competitors Should File a Single Joint Brief. AOL. AOL, the
   world's leading Internet access provider with more than 25 million
   subscribers, is one of Microsoft's fiercest competitors. Appellees
   filed this case largely at the behest of Netscape Communications Corp.
   ("Netscape"), a company acquired by AOL and in whose shoes AOL "now
   stands." (AOL Mot. at 3.) Netscape's then CEO, James Barksdale, was
   appellees' first witness at trial. David Colburn, an AOL senior vice
   president, was appellees' second witness at trial. AOL's joint venture
   with Sun Micro- systems, Inc. ("Sun"), called iPlanet, is a principal
   competitor to Microsoft in the supply of software for use in electronic
   commerce. Sun is itself one of Microsoft's leading competitors in the
   supply of operating system software; a Sun vice president testified for
   appellees at trial; and Sun is actively litigating against Microsoft in
   other venues. AOL, Sun and their allies would be primary beneficiaries
   of the extreme relief awarded against Microsoft in the district court.
   AOL is hardly a "friend of the court" in the traditional sense. To the
   extent AOL has any "unique expertise" regarding the technical issues in
   this case (AOL Mot. at 2), that "factual perspective" (id. at 3) is
   already reflected in the record. AOL and Netscape witnesses testified
   extensively at trial, and it would be totally improper for AOL to
   attempt to supplement their testimony now with additional facts outside
   the record. AOL has no unique insight into the legal issues in the
   case, and its partisan repetition of evidence already volunteered at
   trial would contribute nothing to the Court's resolution of the case.
   If allowed - 3 - to participate as an amicus, however, AOL should at a
   minimum be required to coordinate its efforts with those of other
   Microsoft competitors with whom it has a common interest regarding this
   case, as demonstrated by its membership in ProComp discussed below.
   CCIA and SIIA. These two trade associations are dominated by
   Microsoft's competitors, notably Sun and Oracle Corporation ("Oracle"),
   one of Microsoft's leading com- petitors in the supply of database
   software. Neither CCIA nor SIIA is likely to offer the Court any unique
   insights on the legal issues presented by Microsoft's appeals. Their
   joint brief on the issue of remedies below-though characterized as
   "excellent" by the district court (SIIA Mot. at 2)-was an unseemly
   effort to fill the record with hearsay accusations against Microsoft
   drawn almost entirely from newspaper and magazine articles. Their brief
   to the Supreme Court supporting direct appeal was no different. The
   record is already riddled with hearsay, and there is no occasion for
   inviting more at this stage. In any event, the ability of CCIA and SIIA
   to file joint briefs in the past (id.) demonstrates that it is
   practicable for them to coordinate with Microsoft's other commercial
   adversaries in filing a single joint brief here (if they are allowed to
   participate as amici). See Circuit Rule 29(d) ("Amici curiae on the
   same side must join in a single brief to the extent practicable.").
   ProComp. ProComp is a trade association founded in 1998 by Netscape and
   other Microsoft competitors to provide lobbying and public relations
   support for the govern- ment's assault on Microsoft. ProComp brags that
   its member companies provided "key wit- nesses" for appellees' case.
   (ProComp Mot. at 3.) Those member companies include three of the
   self-described "Gang of Four," i.e., IBM, Netscape (now AOL), Oracle
   and Sun, that have sought to coordinate their development and marketing
   activities "to preempt Microsoft." (DX 1894 at IBM 60969 (a copy of
   which is annexed hereto as Exhibit A).) Oracle and Sun - 4 - are also
   members of both CCIA and SIIA, and those two trade associations are, in
   turn, members of ProComp. If allowed to participate as amici, there is
   no reason why these interlocking trade associations cannot coordinate
   their efforts in this Court. B. Entities with No Particularized
   Interest in this Case Should Be Denied Participation as Amici. TAFOL
   and CMDC. Although these two organizations apparently support
   Microsoft's effort to overturn the judgment entered below, Microsoft
   did not consent to their participation as amici, consistent with its
   general position on this issue. Their filing does not specify their
   particularized interest in this case or otherwise provide a sufficient
   basis for allowing them to file an amicus brief. Peterson, Lundgren and
   Hollaar. The Court should continue to reject the entreaties of private
   individuals to participate in this case as amici. See Order dated
   October 10, 2000 (denying motion of Roy A. Day for leave to participate
   as amicus). Neither Ms. Peterson's "analytical framework" (Peterson
   Mot. at 1) nor Mr. Lundgren's "economic invention" (Lundgren Mot. at 1)
   merit the attention of the Court. Nothing they have to say will make a
   meaningful addition to the parties' presentations on the factual and
   legal issues in the case. Mr. Hollaar-who has made something of a
   career of testifying against Microsoft-claims to have "unique insight"
   (Hollaar Mot. at 2) into the design of Microsoft's operating systems by
   virtue of having examined their source code. First, the record is not
   open to supplementation with Mr. Hollaar's personal views about the
   design of Windows 95 and Windows 98. Second, Mr. Hollaar's claimed
   insight is not unique because Edward Felten, one of appellees' three
   technical experts, studied the source code for Windows 98 and testified
   at trial based on the results of that study. One of Microsoft's
   witnesses, Dr. James - 5 - Allchin, also testified about Windows 95 and
   98 based on his knowledge of their source code. Third, Mr. Hollaar has
   apparently forgotten that he became acquainted with the source code of
   Microsoft's operating systems in the Caldera and Bristol cases pursuant
   to protective orders that strictly prohibit him from using that
   knowledge for any purpose other than pre- paring his testimony in those
   cases. The source code for Microsoft's operating systems is extremely
   valuable intellectual property, and Mr. Hollaar's willingness to breach
   obligations imposed on him by other federal courts to preserve its
   confidentiality should not be countenanced.1 1 Microsoft notes that the
   certificate of service attached to Mr. Hollaar's motion bears a
   document identification number in the footer that is almost identical
   to the one on ProComp's, viz., NYB1192923.1 (Hollaar) versus
   NYB1192197.1 (ProComp). From other information available to Microsoft,
   these numbers clearly indicate that both documents were prepared by
   ProComp's counsel in New York. If Mr. Hollaar can share word processing
   equipment with ProComp's counsel, he can also presumably share his
   views with them for presentation to the Court (to the extent he is
   permitted to do so under outstanding Court orders). - 6 - * * * For the
   foregoing reasons, Microsoft requests that the Court deny the motions
   for leave to participate as amici curiae filed by AOL, CCIA, Lee A.
   Hollaar, Carl Lundgren, Laura Bennett Peterson, ProComp, SIIA, and
   TAFOL and CMDC. Alternatively, Microsoft requests that if any of these
   movants are granted permission to participate as amici curiae, they be
   required to file a single joint brief. Respectfully submitted,
