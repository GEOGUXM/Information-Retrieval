                              Richard A. Muller

   [new.gif] January 28. This morning I told you about the snow on Mt.
   Tamalpais, across the bay north of San Francisco. In 35 years living
   with a view of Mt. Tam, I had never seen anything like it. I have
   posted the photo I took from my home.

   January 28. Error in lecture! One alert student told me (after class)
   that I had put on the blackboard the price of electric energy as $0.20
   per watt-hr. The correct price is approximately $0.20 per
   kilowatt-hour! That's a factor of 1000 typographical error! Please
   correct your notes.

   January 27. I have posted my office hours below.

   January 24. Our GSI, Jessica Walter, has announced her office hours.
   They are Friday 10-12 in 277 LeConte.

   January 23. (New things will always be posted at the very top of this
   page, along with the date of posting.)

   Discussion sections have changed! Monday, Thursday, and Friday sections
   were cancelled. Sorry. Existing Tuesday and Wednesday sections remain.
   Please check on the Changed Discussion Sections page to find out your
   revised discussion section.

   First Homework assignments, as discussed in class:

     By Friday Jan 25. Review your lecture notes by the next lecture!
     (This is always in force, and this is the last time I will
     explicitly mention it on this web page.)
     By Monday, Jan 28. Read Chapter 1, Explosions. Short quiz possible.
     By Tuesday midnight, Jan 29: submit, via email to Jessica Walter,
     our GSI, one or more paragraphs describing something in the news
     that you think might be of interest to the class. Write the
     paragraph after you read the article, without looking at it. (Then
     look at the article, put it aside, and edit your paragraph. Repeat
     until you are satisfied. Submit.)
     By Friday Feb 1: Read the book Nemesis, and be prepared for a brief
     quiz. The purpose of the quiz is to assure that you have actually
     read the book. I don't want you to study the book; just read it and
     try to enjoy it.

   Note on absences: if you have to miss class, and you have a reasonable
   excuse (and even if you don't), email me before the class. I am very
   generous at excusing absences if the excuses arrive prior to the class;
   I rarely excuse others (unless circumstances warrant).

   Introduction.
   Physics for future Presidents? Is that a serious title? The brief
   answer is: yes. For a description of my approach to this course, see
   the introduction page.To get a more complete sense of the course, look
   at the previous web page for PffP Fall 2001. (Warning: that web page
   has the most recent postings at the top, so it may appear backwards.)

   Syllabus

   This is a one semester course that tries to cover everything of
   importance in physics. That is impossible, but I try to make a good
   start. The general outline of topics will follow the text of the book I
   am writing, which is called (to nobody's surprise) Physics for Future
   Presidents. The first draft of this book is posted.The individual
   chapters are in the index, just to the left. (There is no paper copy,
   and you are welcome to read the online version, or to print out pages.)
   Some of these chapters are more polished than others, and they will be
   revised further as the semester evolves. There are about 16 weeks to
   this course, and about 16 chapters, so we will cover roughly one
   chapter per week. We will maintain flexibility, however, so that we can
   incorporate current events. Last semester, just after we had finished
   the chapter on Explosions, the U.S. suffered the terrorist attacks of
   Sept. 11. So last semester, much of the discuss was focussed on
   understanding what was happening, and what might happen.

   Required work

   Attendance at every lecture is required. Absences are excused only if
   email is sent to me prior to the lecture with a plausible excuse.

   Pop quizzes will be given, with no notice, roughly once per week. This
   is my way of checking attendance. The quiz will be very short, and will
   cover material from recent lectures. That means you must do your
   reading on time, and you must review your lecture notes prior to
   attending the next class. Preparing for these quizzes is not time
   consuming, but it takes discipline.

   Homework. You will be expected to read the book Nemesis. Copies will be
   available in lecture for a $10 deposit; please try to bring the deposit
   in cash.
   I ask that you answer a series of brief questions, and email the answer
   to me.
   You will read the textbook that is posted.
   Every Tuesday by midnight you will submit, via email to Jessica Walter,
   our GSI, a one page summary of a physics or technology related
   current-events article that you read. I will post, typically, one of
   the submissions every week. The article could be a news story (the
   Science Times section of the New York Times is published, and posted,
   every Tuesday), or a magazine story (e.g. from Scientific American,
   Science News, Popular Science, Discover, or some similar magazine).
   Your grade will be 0 (if you didn't hand it in, or did a very poor
   job), 1, or 2 (only for the best two or three emails for that week). I
   plan to post the best submission every week. Note: you do NOT have to
   understand the article you read, as long as you can clearly state what
   aspects of the article you did not understand! Try to write something
   that other students will find interesting.

   Exams. We will have two midterm exams and a final exam. Each exam will
   have an essay question and a series of multiple-choice questions.

   Grades. Your final grade will be based on the following breakdown:
     * quizzes: 20%
     * midterm exams: 20% each
     * final exam: 40%
     * homework: 20%

   The grade distribution will be approximately the following: 30% of the
   students will earn an A, 45% a B, and 25% a C or below. This is the
   same distribution that is used for Astronomy 10. Beware: it is easier
   to earn a C than you might think. Every semester I have students who
   got a C, and write me saying that now they can't register in their
   chosen major, or they will lose their scholarship, and they seek my
   help. All I can do is cry with them.

   Required email. Due by Friday, February 1: send email to Muller, at
   muller@physics.berkeley.edu. In the "subject" field enter: "physics 10
   student". Answer the following questions:

   1. full name (first, middle initial, and last)
   2. SID
   3. nickname (what do you like people to call you)
   4. email address
   5. telephone (where do I call if you are late for the final exam? I
   used this last semester!)
   6. year (Freshman? Senior?)
   7. major (or best guess)
   8. most advanced physics you have studied (if any), e.g. "high school
   physics"
   9. physics subject you are most interested in learning about in this
   course, e.g. energy, or quantum mechanics
   10. Tell me about yourself: What do you do when not studying? Do you
   play a musical instrument? Like any sports? Play on a team? Join any
   clubs? Anything interesting about yourself that you are willing to
   share. Don't be shy.

   to contact Muller:

   My email address is muller@physics.berkeley.edu.

   My office hours:

   Monday 10-12 in 390 LeConte Hall. That's on the top floor of the same
   building as the lecture. I do not have a phone at that location. If you
   can't make these, then:
   MWF 8-9 by appointment. (See me after class to schedule a time, or
   telephone.)
   Afternoons: I am often available afternoons at my LBL office. Telephone
   to arrange.

   I spend most of my time at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Blg. 50,
   Room 5032.
   You can telephone me there at (510) 486-7430.

   You can also telephone me at home (before 10 PM, if possible!) at (510)
   849-1940.

   Jessica Walter is our GSI. Her office hours are Friday 10-12, in 277
   LeConte.
