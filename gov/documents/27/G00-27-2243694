   determined to have mental or emotional disabilities to receive
   necessary mental health services that enable these individuals to make
   the transition from welfare to work. The local county welfare
   department and the local mental health department are to jointly
   develop a plan for mental health employment assistance services.
   Subject to specific expenditure authority, mental health services must
   include: assessment; case management as appropriate and as determined
   by the county; treatment and rehabilitation services in coordination
   with an individual's welfare-to-work plan; in cases where a secondary
   diagnosis of substance abuse is made in a person referred for mental or
   emotional disorders, the welfare-to-work plan shall also address the
   substance abuse treatment needs of the participant and lastly, a
   process by which the county can identify those with severe mental
   disabilities that may qualify them for aid under the State
   Supplementary Program for Aged, Blind and Disabled.
