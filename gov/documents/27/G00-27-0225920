                           National Space Science Data Center

   NSSDC supports the space science research community, the education
   enterprise, and the general public.

   NSSDC archives about 20 TB of digital data from about 420 mostly-NASA
   space science spacecraft, of which the most currently important 3 TB
   are electronically accessible. NSSDC also has a large collection of
   film products. Here, "space science" means astronomy and astrophysics,
   solar and space plasma physics, and lunar and planetary science.

   NSSDC provides data electronically and on mailed media. Data obtained
   electronically are free. Data sent via mailed digital media or as photo
   prints may involve nominal charges to cover costs of satisfying the
   request.

   Of the options on the top NSSDC web page:

   The Master Catalog provides access to information about all NSSDC data
   holdings. It is especially useful for those knowing which spacecraft's
   data they are interested in.

   The "Order CD-ROMs and Videotapes" option enables what the name
   implies. Descriptions of the available CD-ROMs (including DVDs and
   CD-WOs) and Videotapes are given.

   Electronic pathways to discipline-specific data or services are
   available from the "science disciplines" section
