     Directions

   Veteran patients consider ease of access when choosing a health care
   plan. Through a contract with Aliron International, Inc., the White
   River Junction VA Medical & Regional Office Center is now able to offer
   primary health care services to veterans in yet another area distanced
   from our main campus.

   The VA Littleton CBOC will serve the primary health care needs of
   eligible veterans. Most of the cost of services provided to veterans
   enrolling in the plan will be paid by the Department of Veterans
   Affairs. Family members of enrolled veterans may also be able to be
   seen at the Littleton Regional Hospital Clinic under their own
   insurance plan.

   SERVICES:

   Services provided and arranged for through the Clinic
     * Primary care physicians
     * Laboratory Tests
     * Preventive services such as annual flu and pneumonia shots
     * Electrocardiograms (EKG)
     * X-rays
     * Medications
     * Gynecological services for female veterans

   ADVANTAGES
     * As an eligible enrolled veteran, you may have little or no costs.
     * A primary care provider coordinates all aspects of your care on an
       ongoing basis.
     * Primary medical care can be obtained close to home without driving
       to the White River Junction VAM&ROC.
     * Routine appointments will normally be scheduled within 72 hours at
       the CBOC.
     * Veterans are still eligible for specialty outpatient care and
       inpatient care as well as all other benefits offered through the
       White River Junction VAM&ROC.
