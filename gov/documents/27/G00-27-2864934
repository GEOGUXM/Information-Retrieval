                                 Helmet Streamers

      Helmet streamers are large cap-like coronal structures with long
      pointed peaks that usually overlie sunspots and active regions. We
      often find a prominence or filament lying at the base of these
      structures. Helmet streamers are formed by a network of magnetic loops
      that connect the sunspots in active regions and help suspend the
      prominence material above the solar surface. The closed magnetic field
      lines trap the electrically charged coronal gases to form these
      relatively dense structures. The pointed peaks are formed by the action
      of the solar wind blowing away from the Sun in the spaces between the
      streamers.

                                   Polar Plumes

      Polar plumes are long thin streamers that project outward from the
      Sun's north and south poles. We often find bright areas at the
      footpoints of these features that are associated with small magnetic
      regions on the solar surface. These structures are associated with the
      "open" magnetic field lines at the Sun's poles. The plumes are formed
      by the action of the solar wind in much the same way as the peaks on
      the helmet streamers.

                                   Coronal Loops

      Coronal loops are found around sunspots and in active regions. These
      structures are associated with the closed magnetic field lines that
      connect magnetic regions on the solar surface. Many coronal loops last
      for days or weeks. Some loops, however, are associated with solar
      flares and are visible for much shorter periods. These loops contain
      denser material than their surroundings. The three-dimensional
      structure and the dynamics of these loops is an area of active
      research.

                                   Coronal Holes

      Coronal holes are regions where the corona is dark. These features were
      discovered when X-ray telescopes were first flown above the earth's
      atmosphere to reveal the structure of the corona across the solar disc.
      Coronal holes are associated with "open" magnetic field lines and are
      often found at the Sun's poles. The high-speed solar wind is known to
      originate in coronal holes.
