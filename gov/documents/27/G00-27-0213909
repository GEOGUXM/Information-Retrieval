   Harvard BSE Risk Assessment Study -- In 1998, the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture asked the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis to evaluate
   measures taken in this country to prevent the spread of BSE to animals
   and humans. The resulting landmark study gives high marks to measures
   taken so far and shows the risk of BSE occurring in the U.S. to be
   extremely low. Full Report. HHS Statement.
