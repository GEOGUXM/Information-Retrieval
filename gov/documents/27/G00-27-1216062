  ABSTRACT

   A benchmark irrigation monitoring network of farms located in a
   32-county area in southwestern Georgia was established in 1995 to
   improve estimates of irrigation water use. A stratified random sample
   of 500 permitted irrigators was selected from a data base--maintained
   by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Georgia Environmental
   Protection Division, Water Resources Management Branch--to obtain 180
   voluntary participants in the study area. Site-specific irrigation data
   were collected at each farm using running-time totalizers and
   noninvasive flowmeters.

   Data were collected and compiled for 50 farms for 1995 and 130
   additional farms for the 1996 growing season--a total of 180 farms.
   Irrigation data collected during the 1996 growing season were compiled
   for 180 benchmark farms and used to develop a statistical model to
   estimate irrigation water use in 32 counties in southwestern Georgia.
   The estimates derived were developed from using a statistical approach
   know as ³bootstrap analysis² that allows for the estimation of
   precision.

   Five model components--whether-to-irrigate, acres irrigated, crop
   selected, seasonal-irrigation scheduling, and the amount of irrigation
   applied--compose the irrigation model and were developed to reflect
   patterns in the data collected at Benchmark Farms Study area sites.

   The model estimated that peak irrigation for all counties in the study
   area occurred during July with significant irrigation also occurring
   during May, June, and August. Irwin and Tift were the most irrigated
   and Schley and Houston were the least irrigated counties in the study
   area. High irrigation intensity primarily was located along the eastern
   border of the study area; whereas, low irrigation intensity was located
   in the southwestern quadrant where ground water was the dominant
   irrigation source. Crop-level estimates showed sizable variations
   across crops and considerable uncertainty for all crops other than
   peanuts and pecans. Counties having the most irrigated acres showed
   higher variations in annual irrigation than counties having the least
   irrigated acres.

   The Benchmark Farms Study model estimates were higher than previous
   irrigation estimates, with 20 percent of the bias a result of
   underestimating irrigation acreage in earlier studies. Model estimates
   showed evidence of an upward bias of about 15 percent with the likely
   cause being a misrepresented inches-applied model. A better
   understanding of the causes of bias in the model could be determined
   with a larger irrigation sample size and increased substantially by
   automating the reporting of monthly totalizer amounts.
