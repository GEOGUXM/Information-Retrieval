   Expired Collector's Stamps

   The Department of Fish and Game announces its final sale of expired
   collectors stamps.

   The Department of Fish and Game (DFG) is holding a final sale of
   expired duck and upland game bird stamps now through June 30, 2002. All
   remaining expired inventory will be destroyed after this date. In
   future license years, duck stamps and upland game bird stamps will be
   offered for sale only until the June 30 expiration date. Additionally,
   the DFG is offering for final sale, the remaining supply of native
   species first day of issue envelopes.

   The DFG has over $2 million worth of these collector items in
   inventory, dating from 1981 through 2001. This is an opportunity for
   private stamp collectors and stamp collecting businesses to purchase
   these items at their face value while they are still available. This
   change will benefit collectors as they will no longer have to compete
   with DFG in selling these items and the limited availability will
   inherently increase their value.

   Duck and upland game bird stamps have beautiful illustrations of a
   variety of species by renown artists. These items make wonderful gifts
   for holidays, birthdays, graduations, retirements or any occasion.
   Collecting wildlife conservation stamps is a popular pastime that many
   wildlife enthusiasts enjoy. Revenue from the sale of duck and upland
   game bird stamps is used to manage and protect Californias waterfowl,
   upland game birds and their habitats.
