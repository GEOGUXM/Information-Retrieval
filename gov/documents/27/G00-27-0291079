   Educational Technology
   NASA Ames offers an array of Internet-based and multimedia software for
   use in the classroom.
   Ames Educational Multimedia Team produces educational multimedia
   products and lesson plans based on NASA research, programs and
   missions. The team has produced popular CD-ROM's such as Mars Virtual
   Exploration and Exploring Aeronautics for grades 5-8. They also
   produced the Lunar Prospector Simulation, which can be downloaded off
   of their Web site and the CD-ROM, Gate to Gate, which will soon appear
   in airport kiosks. More information on these products and how they can
   be obtained can be found on their Web site.
   Center for Mars Exploration (CMEX) is your resource for Mars mission
   information on the Web and on CD-ROM. CMEX offers videos, images and a
   wealth of information on the planet Mars, and missions to Mars.
   Learning Technologies Project (LTP) NASA's Learning Technologies
   Project (LTP) provides online, interactive, multimedia educational
   products derived from NASA Enterprise content. LTP projects increase
   public access to the storehouse of science that NASA has acquired as
   well as the data it is currently acquiring. LTP provides this content
   in accordance with the NASA Plan for Education by creating curriculum
   enhancements for K-12 and K-14 educators and delivering these materials
   via the Internet and other emerging technologies. LTP products are
   offered at about 5,000 (or ~5 percent) of the schools nationwide.

   NASA Quest connects schools with NASAÂ’s people via the Internet through
   Web chats, webcasts, e-mail, informative biographies and journals,
   curriculum resources and more. NASA Quest offers the opportunity to
   communicate with NASA scientists and researchers and to experience the
   excitement of real NASA research as it is happening. To participate in
   this science in action, visit the NASA Quest Web site.
   Observatorium NASA's Observatorium is a public access site for Earth
   and space data. Visit this site to access pictures of the Earth,
   planets, stars, online activities, and lesson plans and the stories
   that go with each.
   Robotics Education Program (REP) is your NASA source for K-12 robotics
   education. REP organizes robotic competitions and will be offering
   online robotics courses
   and labs for credit in the future. Contact Joe Hering (650) 604-2008.
   STELLAR A technology component of STELLAR is the MCP (Multimedia
   Curriculum Project). STELLAR-MCP brings (6-8) high school students with
   capabilities in computer assisted multimedia design to Ames for a 6
   week period in the summer. Working as colleagues with STELLAR teachers
   and Ames Research Center scientists, they produce a CD learning tool on
   a specific topic in space biology. Contact: Sonya Cardenas STELLAR
