Volcanism in the Long Valley area

   The rugged landscape of the Long Valley area owes much of its beauty
   and appeal to the striking geologic features created by growth of the
   imposing peaks of the high Sierra Nevada, glaciation, and volcanic
   eruptions. Residents and visitors alike are confronted with these
   features whether skiing down the steep slopes of Mammoth Mountain,
   digging through lava, glacial deposits, or pumice in order to construct
   foundations for buildings and roads, or exploring the area's hot
   springs, craters, and craggy peaks.

   Long Valley Caldera was created about 760,000 years ago by an enormous
   explosive eruption. Scientists estimate that about 600 km^3 (140 mi^3)
   of magma was erupted, mainly as hot pyroclastic flows; this eruption
   ejected at least 50 times more magma than the 1991 eruption of Mount
   Pinatubo in the Philippines. The ejection of so much molten rock
   partially evacuated the magma reservoir, which caused the ground to
   collapse into the reservoir. The result was an enormous depression
   between 17 and 32 km in diameter!

   This massive eruption was followed by hundreds of smaller eruptions
   over the next few hundred thousand years. These eruptions of lava
   flows, domes, and pyroclastic flows were concentrated in the central
   and western parts of the caldera. At the same time, the central section
   of the caldera was bowed upward in response to new magma rising into
   the shallow reservoir. The upward rise of the caldera floor created the
   "resurgent dome", a broad, dome-shaped highland of post-caldera lava
   domes about 9 km in diameter that stands about 500 m above the
   surrounding low-lands that form the caldera "moat."

   Mammoth Mountain was built by the eruption of at least 12 different
   steep domes and thick lava flows. These eruptions occurred between
   about 200,000 and 50,000 years ago. Volcanic activity then moved
   northward to the Mono Lake area about 35,000 years ago to build the
   Mono Craters, a collection of more than 30 overlapping lava flows,
   domes, cones, and craters. The most recent eruptions in the area
   occurred from the Mono Craters and Inyo Craters about 600 years ago,
   and from Negit Island in Mono Lake about 250 years ago.
