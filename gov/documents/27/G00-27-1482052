   Welcome to the Power & On-Board Propulsion Technology Division's
   website. Within these pages you will find many exciting, diverse
   technologies which are advancing the state-of-the-art in the aerospace
   power and propulsion fields. Not only do many NASA projects benefit
   from these technologies, but these aerospace technologies also have
   major impacts on our everyday lives. One example is where our studies
   of atomic oxygen impacting and wearing out satellite insulation led to
   the discovery of atomic oxygen as an advanced cleaning tool for medical
   devices and rare paintings. Our improvements in solar cells for space
   has led to less expensive, more efficient, environmentally-friendly
   power systems for remote locations on earth. Our research on
   lighter-weight regenerative fuel cells benefits power systems for
   buildings and cars as well as future Lunar and Martian bases.

   I hope you enjoy browsing our website. Be sure to watch for
   opportunities to use our research to your advantage. You can reach us
   through the various points-of-contact listed in our Feedback Page
   representing the technology areas, or I can be reached at
