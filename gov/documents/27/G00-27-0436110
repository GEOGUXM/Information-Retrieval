   The Idaho National Engineering & Environmental Laboratory (INEEL),
   capitalizing on its extensive experience, equipment resources, and
   extended scientific database, has established the INEEL Gamma-Ray
   Spectrometry Center. The purpose of the Center is to provide
   specialized data and technical services in the field of Gamma-ray
   Spectrometry for radiation measurements in many disciplines.

   This site includes integrated technical reference material of gamma
   energies, decay spectra and actual spectral Data in catalog form,
   history of gamma-ray Spectrometry at the INEEL, and Links to other
   sources of nuclear data. We hope this information is useful for
   educating and supporting users who are applying Gamma-ray Spectrometry
   to an expanding experimental and application based environment.
