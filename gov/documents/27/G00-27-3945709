   As of today, 1/30/02, the dog teams have detected 7083 unmarked parcels
   containing plant material, 3940 were in violation of plant quarantines.
   Of these, 1186 pests were intercepted with 528 being quarantine pests.
   Quarantine terminal point inspection in California is conducted
   primarily at post offices and private express carrier locations by the
   local county department of agriculture under the direction of CDFA. But
   this program inspects parcels already marked for agricultural
   inspection. By design it cannot effectively deter the unintentional or
   deliberate smuggling of prohibited plant material, even though this
   pathway is considered a high risk.
   In 1996 the California Legislature approved implementation of a
   two-year pilot parcel inspection program using dogs to screen parcels
   for prohibited plant material. Employment of dogs to sniff out unmarked
   prohibited plant material enhances and effectively complements the
   current inspection program and provides a highly visible smuggling
   deterrent. The canine program is structured to provide only
   surveillance level inspection at parcel terminals. At this time,
   facilities considered high-risk based on historical interceptions and
   fruit fly finds are being monitored in the Los Angeles Basin and the
   San Francisco Bay Area. Since June 1997 the program has been fully
   operational with eight dog teams; six teams in the Los Angeles Basin
   and two in the San Francisco Bay Area.
