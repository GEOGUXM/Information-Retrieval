   WASC provides a comprehensive suite of administrative services to NOAA,
   various Department of Commerce Bureaus and other federal agencies. We
   operate under the DoC and NOAA policy guidelines and delegated
   authority through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA) as the host agency. The DoC Bureaus we currently support under
   interagency agreement are:


Bureau of Export Administration             Minority Business Development Agency
Economic Development Administration         International Trade Administration
National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration

   We also are presently providing acquisition services to the US Navy and
   General Services Administration (GSA) and Alternative Dispute
   Resolution (ADR) services to the Census Bureau on a reimbursable basis.

   WASC services include procurement, personnel services, health and
   safety, administrative payments, real and personal, space management,
   regional engineering, environmental compliance, publications, IT

   In addition to directing administrative support activities, the WASC
