        For several years, scientists from BNL and four collaborating
      institutions have been studying how the epilepsy drug GVG impacts
      addictive drugs' effects on brain biochemistry and behavior. The
     following are the authors on the paper that details the most recent
                                  results.

                           STEPHEN L. DEWEY, Ph.D.
                       Brookhaven National Laboratory

     Dr. Dewey is a recognized researcher in the field of
     neuropsychopharmacology, the study of how chemicals called
     neurotransmitters interact in the brain to influence sensation and
     behavior. He has specialized in research on drug addiction and
     mental illness, including schizophrenia. Currently a Scientist in
     the Chemistry Department at the U.S. Department of Energy's
     Brookhaven National Laboratory, he also holds a position as research
     associate professor in the Psychiatry Department at the New York
     University School of Medicine.

     Dr. Dewey earned his Ph.D. in anatomy from the University of Iowa in
     1985, and a B.S. in biology from Fairleigh Dickinson University in
     1981. Before coming to Brookhaven in 1986, he held a postdoctoral
     fellowship in the Neurology Department at the State University of
     New York at Stony Brook, and a predoctoral fellowship from the
     National Institute of Mental Health. He is a member of the American
     College of Neuropsychopharmacology. A father of two, he is a past
     president of the Eastport School Board, Eastport, NY and is now a
     member of the Eastern Suffolk BOCES Board of Education.

                            St. John's University

     Dr. Ashby is a neuropsychopharmacologist and has conducted research
     on psychotropic drugs, particularly antipsychotics and addictive
     drugs, using biochemical, behavioral and electrophysiological
     techniques.

     Currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical
     Science of the College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions at
     St. John's University, Dr. Ashby also holds a collaborative
     appointment at Brookhaven and a visiting assistant professorship at
     the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He has been honored with an
     Outstanding Junior Faculty Award at St. John's, where he teaches
     pharmacology. He received his Ph.D. in Pharmacology from the
     University of Louisville School of Medicine in 1987, after taking a
     B.A. in biology and psychology from there in 1983. Dr. Ashby is a
     member of the Society for Neuroscience.

                       JONATHAN D. BRODIE, Ph.D., M.D.
                   New York University School of Medicine

     Dr. Brodie is a Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at New
     York University School of Medicine and a Board-certified practicing
     psychiatrist. After receiving his Ph.D. in Physiological Chemistry
     from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1962, Dr. Brodie
     continued his research in enzymology and bioinorganic reaction
     mechanisms for the next decade. In 1975 he received an M.D. from
     NYU.

     Since completing his psychiatric Residency, he has been conducting
     research on the biological basis of schizophrenia and its treatment
     using brain imaging to study brain chemistry in collaboration with
     Dr. Dewey and other Brookhaven and NYU scientists. For much of that
     time, he was the NYU Director of the Brookhaven-NYU collaboration in
     positron emission tomography (PET). Dr. Brodie is a Fellow of the
     American Psychiatric Association and a Laughlin Fellow of the
     American College of Psychiatrists. He is a member of the American
     Chemical Society, the American Society of Biological Chemists, and
     the Society of Nuclear Medicine.
