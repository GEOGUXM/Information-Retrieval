   The University of California Coordination Team seeks to foster enhanced
   collaborations with the faculty and staff of the nine UC campuses, the
   other two UC-managed national laboratories (Lawrence Berkeley and
   Lawrence Livermore), and New Mexico Universities.Many exciting and
   productive interactions already exist. We want to build on these
   successes and develop new collaborations that will benefit the
   Laboratory and the UC system. This desire is strongly supported by the
   leaders in the UC Office of the President (UCOP).

   Science and Technology (S&T) Assessment
   The UC team also leads the efforts to conduct the annual Laboratory S&T
   Assessment. This effort is described in the S&T Assessment Section and
   the S&T templates are located in this section.

   University of California Directed Research and Development (UCDRD)
   Our Web site provides information on the programs we manage for funding
   collaborative research between the Laboratory and UC and between the
   Laboratory and New Mexico universities. We also provide the calls for
   proposals and guidelines for obtaining this funding.

   We support the following four UCDRD programs:

     * Collaborative UC/Los Alamos Research (CULAR) Program
     * University of California Research Partnership Initiatives (UCRPI)
     * New Mexico Universities Collaborative Research (NUCOR) Program
     * New Mexico Universities Research Partnership Initiatives (NMRPI)

   The first two programs are designed to enhance our collaborations with
   UC campuses, and the third and fourth programs are designed to
   strengthen research collaborations with New Mexico universities.

   Feedback
   We would appreciate hearing about your UC-related activities. We want
   to thank the many people who continue to help us build stronger ties
   with UC. Your comments, suggestions, and questions are welcome.
