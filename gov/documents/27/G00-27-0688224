          The Mission of the South Florida Water Management District is to
   manage and protect water resources of the region by balancing and
   improving water quality, flood control, natural systems, and water
   supply. [dotclear.gif]
          We are working to restore and manage ecosystems and protect
   water quality -- from central Florida's Kissimmee River to Lake
   Okeechobee, and from coast to coast, spanning the peninsula from Fort
   Myers to Fort Pierce, south through the sprawling Everglades to Florida
   Bay. We are also working to improve and plan for long-term water supply
   and flood control needs through a number of District programs, and
   through the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP).

          District Headquarters are located in West Palm Beach, at 3301
   Gun Club Road, just south of Palm Beach International Airport. The
   Headquarters campus includes two buildings, a three-story facility
   which overlooks the West Palm Beach Canal (also known as C-51) and
   Southern Boulevard; and a single-story building, directly off Gun Club
   Road. The two buildings house about 926 employees. [dotclear.gif]

   Phone: (561) 686-8800 or 1-800-432-2045 (Florida Only)

   Another 674 employees are headquartered at other locations throughout
   the District: at seven regional Service Centers, created to offer many
   of the services available at Headquarters, yet tailored to meet local
   needs; as well as at seven area Field Stations and 20 Pump Stations.
   These employees live and work in their respective communities -- to
   most effectively meet the needs of those communities, and carry out
   local projects and programs.
