     Sixth Annual Meeting to Focus on the Role of Secondary Calibration
                                Laboratories

   The Council on Ionizing Radiation Measurements and Standards (CIRMS)
   will hold its sixth annual meeting at the National Institute for
   Standards and Technology (NIST) from November 12^th through 14^th,
   1997. In following the traditions of past meetings, the 1997 CIRMS
   meeting will provide the opportunity for extensive discussions on the
   first day concerning the activities of the Council and the revision of
   the National Needs Report. The following two days will feature
   presentations on the role of secondary calibration laboratories in the
   field of measurements and standards.

   The program will feature key speakers from the standards community. Jim
   Cigler of NIST will discuss the acceptance of ISO Guide 25 in the U.S.
   standards community. Status up-dates will be given by Robert Loesch of
   DOE on the DOELAP Accreditation Program, by Ken Swinth of Swinth
   Associates on the HPS Secondary Calibration Laboratory Program, and by
   Joe McDonald on the NVLAP Personnel Dosimetry Program. Presentations
   will also be made by Tom Heaton of the FDA on the NVLAP Calibration
   Laboratory Program, by Francisco Aguirre of the M.D. Anderson Cancer
   Center on the NCI Radiation Physics Calibration Program, by Geoffrey
   Ibbott of the University of Kentucky on the AAPM Accredited Dosimetry
   Calibration Laboratory Program, and by Brian Zimmerman from NIST on the
   NEI Radiopharmaceutical Program. In the area of radiation effects,
   David Gilliam of NIST will discuss the Intercomparison of Neutron
   Dosimetry Standards, and Rod Chu of MDS Nordion will cover the
   Secondary Laboratory High-Dose Sterilization Calibrations. Also in the
   area of public and environmental radiation presentations will be made
   by Ken Inn of NIST on the NIST Radioactivity Intercomparison Program,
   by Pamela Greenlaw on the DOE program at the Environmental Measurements
   Laboratory, and by Dave McCurdy of Yankee Atomic Electric Company on
   Nuclear Energy Institute/NIST power plant radiochemistry. In addition
   to the excellent domestic participation, international participation is
   increasing as demonstrated by scheduled talks from Jurgen Bohm of the
   PTB (Germany), Pedro Andreo of the IAEA (Italy), and Penelope
   Allisy-Roberts of BIPM (France).

   Throughout the meeting there will be opportunity for open discussion
   and satellite meetings. There will be a poster session displayed during
   the entire meeting. CIRMS will hold its annual business meeting at
   which Robert Loesch from DOE will become the CIRMS President, taking
   over from Larry DeWerd and results of the election to fill the CIRMS
   Vice-President positions will be announced.

   The first day of this annual meeting will be spent mainly on the 1998
   edition of the National Needs Report. This will include sessions on
   roadmapping the new Measurement Program Descriptions (MPDs) and
   revisions of the current draft of the report. The subcommittees of the
   Science and Technology Committee will meet to discuss the Measurement
   Program Descriptions in their areas to review the status of the MPDs
   published in 1985 and to review proposed new ones. There will also be a
   directed tour of NIST facilities.

   A message from the President

   Recognition of CIRMS

   CIRMS has had a great deal of activity. Our organization is beginning
   to be recognized by other organizations and individuals. One of the
   vehicles that is helping to accomplish this is our special topical
   meetings. It is relatively easy for individuals to realize the impact
   of CIRMS through these meetings. I am pleased at the special topical
   meetings scheduled for this year. Actually we had other topics in mind
   as well, but there are only a limited number that can be done. The
   future revision of the NEEDS report to be published in January 1998
   will also contribute to this recognition of CIRMS. By the time you read
   this the Executive Committee will have had their one day "retreat" to
   discuss the NEEDS report and other topics related to CIRMS. The prior
   NEEDS report showed its usefulness and was used before congress. I hope
   that we can make the next revision more useful to press the envelope of
   standards and measurements. The subcommittee chairs and the
   subcommittees themselves are to be commended for their work on this.

   We also have been trying to get a web site up and running for CIRMS.
   This unfortunately has moved much slower than expected. You should be
   able to access it now at http://CIRMS.org. There still is a lot of work
   to do on it, but it does exist. Bill Casson has put a lot of effort
   toward it.

   Looking forward, our annual meeting on November 12, 13, and 14, 1997,
   will cover the Role of Secondary Laboratories in Measurement Quality
   Assurance. The list of speakers is finalized and it looks like it will
   be a very good meeting. There will be good representation from the
   International Standards and Measurement community.

   CIRMS will soon have to address an international viewpoint. This will
   also be a topic discussed at the Executive committee retreat.

   This has been an interesting and exciting year for CIRMS with greater
   recognition. The activities of this year have worked to increase the
   status and recognition of CIRMS.

   About CIRMS

   The Council on Ionizing Radiation Measurements and Standards (CIRMS)
   operates as an incorporated non-profit organization exclusively for
   educational and scientific purposes relevant to the furtherance of
   ionizing radiation measurements and standards. The general purpose of
   CIRMS is to advance and disseminate the physical measurements and
   standards needed for safe and effective technological applications of
   ionizing radiation, and for protection against hazards associated with
   environmental radiation. In the conduct of its various activities,
   CIRMS brings together representatives from academic, professional, and
   industrial organizations, and from governmental departments and
   agencies, as well as interested individuals, involved in nearly every
   aspect of ionizing radiation. A principal CIRMS activity is the
   sponsorship of an annual meeting to disseminate and exchange
   information, to provide a forum for the discussion of common problems
   and issues, and to promote cooperation and communication within the
   radiation measurements community.

   CIRMS Accepts Resignation of Second Vice President

   It was with at great deal of sadness and regret that CIRMS President
   Larry DeWerd accepted the resignation of Second Vice-President Joe
   McKeown recently. Joe, who was elected during the last business meeting
   in November of 1996, reported that his participation was no longer
   assured due to health considerations. Joe has been an active
   participant and supporter of CIRMS since its inception. Joe recently
   retired from Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd and always provided valuable
   insights from the international perspective as well as from his many
   years of experience in the radiation measurements community. He would
   have become First Vice-President during the 1997 Business Meeting and
   President at the 1998 Meeting. The Executive Committee wishes to extend
   a heartfelt thanks for Joe for his participation and wish him well in
   the future. We will continue to look forward to his participation in
   what ever way he is able and hope to see him at future meetings and
   workshops.

   NIST Radiochemistry Intercomparison Program

   The NIST Radiochemistry Intercomparison Program NRIP, as described in
   the CIRMS PERP traceability MPD published in the 1985 National Needs
   Report, marks the successful completion of the first year of its
   measurement traceability program for low-level environmental
   radioactivity measurements. Three rounds of testing (water, airfilters,
   synthetic urine) were completed. The laboratories underwriting the
   program in the first year of testing were Auburn University (Auburn,
   AL), Carlsbad Environmental Monitoring and Research Center (Carlsbad,
   NM), Environmental Evaluation Group (Carlsbad, NM), National Air and
   Radioactivity Environmental Laboratory (Montgomery, AL), Sandia
   National Laboratory (Albuquerque, NM), Westinghouse Savannah River
   Company (Aiken, SC), and Westinghouse Waste Isolation Division
   (Carlsbad, NM). All participants agreed that the program is vital for
   relating low-level radioanalytical measurements to the National
   Standards. Test materials include both environmental (water, soils,
   sediments, vegetation, etc.) and bioassay (urine, fecal material)
   sample matrices. Laboratories were issued Certificates of Traceability
   for the matrices and nuclides of the tests.

   The program has been implemented to meet the demand for traceability as
   defined under ANSI N42.23. This voluntary standard defines a hierarchy
   of traceability with an unbroken linkage from service laboratories to
   NIST. Under the standard, the testing materials are (1) of appropriate
   matrices (i.e., matrix categories commonly analyzed by the laboratory)
   and (2) of appropriate (ambient) activity concentration ranges for
   these matrices. Currently NRIP is the only traceability program
   providing performance evaluation materials at environmental levels.
   Consequently, it has been necessary for laboratories in need of
   traceability for low-level natural-matrix and bioassay radioactivity
   sample measurements to participate in NRIP.

   In the coming year aqueous solutions, glass-fiber filters, artificial
   urine and fecal material, and soil will be the test matrices. The
   analyte list has been expanded to include ^90Sr, ^234U,^ 238U, ^238Pu,
   ^239/240Pu, ^241Am, at 0.03-0.3 Bq per sample. Continued growth in the
   number of participating laboratories is anticipated from the
   commercial, national and international communities.

   Preliminary Attendance Numbers High for Electronic Dosimetry Workshop

   Conference organizers at NIST report that over 80 people have
   registered at the Electronic Dosimetry Workshop being held at NIST
   starting October 14^th. The workshop, jointly sponsored by NRC, CIRMS,
   and NIST, was organized as part of the activities of the CIRMS
   Occupational Radiation Protection Subcommittee, chaired by Ken Swinth,
   of the Science and Technology Committee. The purpose of the workshop
   was to define the conditions under which electronic dosimeters can be
   used for primary dosimetry in the near term and the steps needed to
   gain general acceptance of electronic dosimeters for primary dosimetry.
   Results and conclusions of the workshop will be presented at the CIRMS
   Annual Meeting in November and will be summarized in the next CIRMS
   Newsletter. The high attendance numbers at this workshop is a very
   strong indicator of the future of personnel radiation dosimetry and the
   interest in moving the national standards and regulations toward
   acceptance of this technology as well as guidance in implementation.

   Environmental Radioactivity SRM for Radiochemical Metrology

   Over the past decades, on the order of 10^15 Becquerels of waste have
   been disposed of in the oceans by the nuclear countries. Potential
   contamination by leaking nuclear waste, including the 17 sunken Russian
   nuclear submarines in the Arctic Ocean, has caused world wide concern
   for the ecosphere and commercial food chain. Because the determination
   of mBq/ g^-1 levels of radioactivity in oceanic sediments is a
   difficult technical task for all international monitoring laboratories,
   a common basis for measurement quality assurance, methods verification,
   and data comparability is provided by the new NIST Ocean Sediment
   Standard Reference Material (SRM 4357), as recommended by the CIRMS
   PERP environmental standards MPD. The SRM was developed using a
   composite of 1 percent contaminated Irish Sea sediment and 99 percent
   Chesapeake Bay sediment by weight. Ten radionuclides including ^40K,
   ^90Sr, ^137Cs, ^226Ra, ^228Ra, ^228Th, ^230Th, ^232Th, ^238Pu, and
   ^239-240Pu were certified through a comparison study among twenty
   international laboratories. The mean values were reported for an
   additional 11 uncertified radionuclides: ^129I, ^155Eu, ^210Po, ^210Pb,
   ^212Pb, ^214Bi, ^234U, ^235U, ^238U, ^237Np. and ^241Am. Interestingly,
   the measurement results for the primordial radionuclides were
   distributed normally, while those for the anthropogenic radionuclides
   were best described by Weibull distributions.

   SRM 4357 will be followed by additional low-level radioactivity natural
   matrix SRMs. The Ashed Bone matrix will be certified in 1998, followed
   by the Rocky Flats Soil II (1999) and the Japan, White and Irish Seas
   composite Shellfish.

   CIRMS Holds Annual Executive Committee Retreat

   The Executive Committee gathered at NIST for its annual retreat to
   discuss the status and future directions for the Council. The Committee
   is composed of the Past President, President, First and Second Vice
   Presidents, Secretary/Treasurer and the NIST Representative. Also
   present were the Chairman of the Science and Technology Committee,
   Communications Committee, Medical, Public and Environmental Radiation
   Protection, and Radiation Effects Subcommittees, and the Executive
   Secretary.

   Initial discussions centered on the direction and future of CIRMS. In
   the past, comments have been made and agreed to that CIRMS should play
   a pro-active role in the measurements and standards community. It was
   noted that CIRMS helped to organize and participated in a very large
   number of workshops and meetings. Many of these were organized through
   the Science and Technology Committee's Subcommittees. It was agreed
   that this type of activity was what was desired and should be
   continued. Topics for future workshops will be solicited during the
   annual meeting.

   A good portion of the Executive Committee Retreat was devoted was
   devoted to the National Needs Report. This report is distributed to
   members of Congress and the Executive branch of the government as well
   as key personnel in the various departments who have interest in
   radiation measurements and standards The report consist of a series of
   recommendations called Measurement Program Descriptions(MPDs). Since
   the first report was issued in January 1995, significant progress has
   been made in accomplishing several of the goals outlined in the MPDs.
   The subcommittee chairs present reported to the Executive Committee the
   progress made on existing MPDs and proposed new ones.

   Part of reaching the goals outlined in the National Needs Report is the
   planning strategy called a roadmap. Each MPD has a person assigned to
   take primary responsibility for editing the MPD and laying out an
   appropriate roadmap. This person, called a champion, is to be assisted
   by a representative of NIST and other interested members of the
   subcommittees. It was noted that although some MPDs have moved forward
   rapidly, others have suffered due to the heavy workload already
   assigned to the champions. CIRMS President Larry DeWerd encouraged the
   subcommittee chairs to try to have completed drafts for a new report
   for review by the subcommittees at the annual meeting.

   Changes to the Council By-Laws were considered but none were
   recommended for presentation to the business meeting this year.
   Candidates for First and Second Vice Presidents were discussed. Results
   from that search effort will be reported at the annual meeting. The
   draft agenda for the annual meeting was received from the organizers
   and favorably reviewed. Topics for future annual meetings were
   discussed and a list compiled for presentation at the Annual Business
   Meeting. Finally, a procedure for implementing changes to the CIRMS
   Homepage was discussed and accepted. A new and improved Homepage is now
   on the web at http://cirms.org. Suggestions for improvements or items
   to be included should be sent directly to the editor at
   cassonwh@lanl.gov.

   Electron Beam Workshop Addresses Future Needs

   The Radiation Effects Sub-Committee of the CIRMS Committee on Science
   and Technology held a workshop on the "Needs of the Electron Beam
   Processing Industry" on Friday, October 17, 1997, at the Long Island
   High Technology Incubator at the State University of New York in Stony
   Brook. Included among the 23 attendees were two NIST representatives,
   several toll service providers, users and potential end users of
   electron accelerators, some from academic and research institutions and
   most of the major manufacturers of high current, industrial electron
   beam accelerators.

   The meeting was opened by Dr. Kennard (Ken) Morganstern. In his career
   as a physicist and entrepreneur, Ken was a founder of three companies
   involved in the field of medical and industrial radiation processing.
   First was the Nuclear Corporation of America (now NUCORP), second was
   Radiation Dynamics, Inc., and more recently, Medical Sterilization,
   Inc. In addition, twenty five years ago Ken cofounded the well known
   International Meeting on Radiation Processing, a series of meetings
   that convenes every two years in countries around the world. Ken
   related that his vision of the future of industrial radiation
   processing began as early as 1958. It was based on the possibility of
   radiation crosslinking the insulation on cable produced by Anaconda
   Wire and Cable, a company located in New York State. The Dynamitron, a
   high power accelerator invented by Marsh Cleland and still under
   development at the time, seemed just the right technology for the
   application. Together, Morganstern and Cleland founded Radiation
   Dymnamics Inc. It took another 20 years until industrial applications
   gained a strong foot hold and today the industry represents a world
   wide industry accounting for billions of dollars in sales of
   irradiation processed products.

   Dr. Marshall Cleland, the first President of CIRMS and now with Atomic
   Energy Canada Limited, reviewed the worldwide distribution of
   accelerator

   installations (see below). He pointed out that previous estimates may
   have been low since they did not include installations in the former
   Soviet Union and other eastern block countries, nor were there adequate
   accounts of accelerator installations in Japan and the Pacific rim.

                  High Current EB Processing Installations

Voltage Range           Number of units         Average Power
0.1 - 0.3MeV               300                    100kW
0.5 - 5.0MeV               700                    40kW
5.0 - 15MeV                 35                    15kW


   The growth in the use of low voltage, self-shielded high current
   accelerators is being pulled by the attention to the elimination of
   solvents and air pollutants from coating and printing operations. The
   core of the industrial accelerator business, however, remains the high
   current, mid-voltage area, where the traditional use of EB processing
   for the crosslinking of wire and cable jacketing and films remains the
   major end use. From the point of view of equipment technology, there
   have been considerable advances in the high current, higher voltage
   accelerator area. However, the market acceptance for these pieces of
   equipment, with their ability to deliver electron beams with greater
   penetration, is still evolving.

   Dr. Paul Farrell, from Brookhaven Technology Group, Inc., chairman of
   the workshop, led a discussion of the needs of the electron beam
   processing industry. He expressed concern that the Radiation Effects
   Subcommittee was poorly represented at last years annual CIRMS meeting.
   Thinking that this may be a result of the perception that the radiation
   effects subcommitee is only concerned with radiation measurements,
   standards and dosimetry, Farrell suggested that the name be changed
   from Radiation Effects to Industrial Applications to emphasize the
   broader interest of the industrial radiation community.

   The workshop went on to discuss the difficulties in advancing the use
   of EB processing. Dr. Farrell pointed out that there were typically too
   many suppliers and too few customers. Traditionally, EB processing has
   been perceived only for the relatively high capital costs of the
   equipment and not in terms of the added value EB processing brings to
   the user.

   In going over several options on how the EB processing industry can
   advance its interests, including possibly forming a trade association,
   it was deemed best by all present to work within the CIRMS
   sub-committee with the proposed new name of Industrial Applications.
   The group will continue to develop programs to strengthen the EB
   community at the next annual meeting in November.

   It was generally agreed that historic markets such as wire and cable
   and the use of EB processing in tire manufacture have matured, but will
   see marginal growth through the globalization of these technologies.
   Likewise, there has been considerable advancement in the acceptance of
   EB treatment in the sterilization of medical devices. In the coatings
   area of interest to manufacturers of low voltage accelerators, industry
   needs are being met by other groups, such as the various RadTech
   associations.

   The workshop attendees thought that the EB processing industry could
   now be best served by focusing on three main areas of opportunity:

   1 - Food Irradiation, especially timely given the growing concerns over
   bacterial contamination in the US food supply chain.

   2 - Environmental uses, such as in the treatment of water and
   wastewater and stack gases, where EB technolgy has shown its ability to
   remove

   pollutants, and in the disinfection of medical and hospital wastes.

   3 - Polymers, such as in the curing of the resin systems used in
   composite manufacture and extending to the use of EB to treat
   cellulosics by promoting breakdown for subsequent processing and
   extending to the use of EB technology for polymer synthesis itself.

   Interest was also expressed in greater cooperation with the academic
   community doing research work involving ionizing radiation and its
   effects on materials. Government and industry sources may be asked to
   assist in bringing together those in the university community so that
   curriculum needs can be addressed. It was felt that there are too few
   graduates trained or even vaguely familiar with EB processing and EB
   science and technology.

   The Radiation Effects Sub-Committee will reconvene as part of the CIRMS
   annual meeting, on Wednesday, November 12. The attendees agreed that at
   some point in the future the EB processing community will hold a
   several day conference to address the needs and interests of its
   constituents.

   Strength in Diversity; Concern for All

   Editorial - William H. Casson and Anthony Berejka

   During its brief six year history, CIRMS has brought together a
   diversity of interests within the radiation community. The CIRMS annual
   meetings have been attended by representatives of industrial companies,
   such as those from the radiation processing field, by research
   scientists, such as those working in the health and medical physics
   area and within national laboratories, by those involved in reactor
   issues, by suppliers of radiation measurement systems, and by
   individuals representing various regulatory agencies. This amazing
   diversity has been a major strength of CIRMS as envisioned in its
   founding.

   A major goal of CIRMS is to promote the safe use of radiation in
   government and industry. At the same time, CIRMS does not promulgate
   policies nor express opinions which are intended to promote individual
   positions nor be used for corporate gain. Participation in CIRMS is
   open to all. Positions developed within CIRMS, as expressed in the
   newsletter or in the National Needs Report, are the result of the
   formation of consensus amongst scientific and technical experts in a
   given area.

   In building of consensus, CIRMS takes great care to respect
   confidentiality and the bounds and constraints of patent protocols,
   etc. A number of participants within CIRMS are routinely involved in
   technology transfer issues. However, CIRMS provides THE FORUM for open
   discussion of issues which are pertinent to an industry, health or
   societal area when viewed in its entirety. CIRMS is the one
   organization which provides for such cross-disciplinary discussion and
   for openness amongst its participants.

   As summarized in the CIRMS objectives as expressed in its By-Laws:

   + CIRMS will operate as a non-profit organization for educational and
   scientific purposes relevant to the furtherance of ionizing radiation
   measurements and standards.

   + CIRMS will provide a forum for the discussion of relevant issues and
   for the cooperation and communication among interested parties.

   + CIRMS is to study and gather information, define and prioritize
   needed work in the field, and provide that information to all
   interested parties.

   + CIRMS will hold or sponsor meetings, workshops, and seminars to
   disseminate

   and exchange information of relevance to the participants.

   Pursuit of these objectives is a formidable task. Only by cooperation
   and through the building of consensus in an open and deliberative
   fashion can CIRMS effectively bring together the strengths it gathers
   from its diverse constituency drawn from industry, academia and
   government. Pursuing this building of consensus is the challenge set
   before the Executive Committee and the sub-committee chairs.

   Your involvement is not only welcome, but essential.
