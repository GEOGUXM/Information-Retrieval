                      Oregon Water-Resources Bibliography

   This bibliography contains reports pertaining to Oregon's water
   resources (and those of some areas of southern Washington). Most of the
   reports in the list have been published by the USGS or were authored by
   USGS personnel and published in State of Oregon reports, in journals,
   or in proceedings. The Oregon Water Resources Department and the Oregon
   Department of Environmental Quality are other good sources of
   information about water availability and water quality in the State.
