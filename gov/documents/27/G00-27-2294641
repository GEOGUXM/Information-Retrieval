                         Orville and Wilbur Wright

   There is something quintessentially American about Orville and Wilbur
   Wright's historic achievement at Kitty Hawk on December 17, 1903. They
   worked independently, as most American heroes have done, free of the
   entanglements of large industrial or government organizations. Their
   intense preoccupation with their airplane was fueled not by economic
   necessity -- income they already had, from their bicycle business --
   but mostly from their imaginative determination to cross one of the
   last technological barriers to human flight- stability in the air.
