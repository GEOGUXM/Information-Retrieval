  Introduction

   Connecting America

   Our Nation is held together by the most extensive transportation
   network in history. The highway system connects people to jobs,
   hospitals, places of worship, cultural and sporting events, national
   parks, and to family members across the country. It also provides a
   vital link in our countrys economic development and national defense
   connecting manufacturers to retailers, farms to markets, military
   installations to deployment stations and shippers to seaports, airports
   and railroads

   The Federal Highway Program: Throughout its history, the Federal
   Highway Administration (FHWA) has met the ongoing challenge of adapting
   to the changing times. With the Interstate System essentially complete,
   our focus has turned toward the post-Interstate era. Through the
   landmark Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991
   (ISTEA) and its 1998 successor, the Transportation Equity Act for the
   21st Century (TEA-21), our emphasis has been updated to meet the
   demands of an increasingly urban, mobile, diverse, and prosperous
   society

   In addition to preserving the taxpayers investment in the Interstate
   System, the FHWA is working with its partners in the State
   transportation departments to improve the larger National Highway
   System (NHS) of 160,000 miles. The NHS includes the Interstate System
   and other roads of national importance, such as roads important for
   national defense and highway connectors to intermodal facilities.

   The Federal-Aid Highway Program, begun in 1916, operates today with a
   budget of nearly $30 billion a year. Our varied funding programs
   include financial aid for nearly 1 million miles of roadways, as well
   as bridges, ferries, traffic operations centers, transit, recreational
   trails, bicycle facilities, pedestrian facilities, scenic byways, and
   historic transportation facilities. Now State and local officials can
   select the best mix of projects to address their unique transportation
   challenges.

   We also continue our historic role, dating to the 1910's, of helping
   Federal land management agencies develop, preserve, and improve
   transportation access to Federal lands. The Federal Lands Highways
   Program, authorized at more than $700 million a year, provides
   planning, design, and construction support for forest highways,
   parkways, park roads, Indian reservation roads, refuge roads, and other
   Federal roads.

   Transportation research and development is crucial to the future of our
   highway system. We operate a world-class research laboratory, the
   Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center in McLean, Virginia. Working
   with our public and private partners, the FHWA is identifying research
   needs, coordinating and conducting studies and, most importantly,
   sharing results around the world. The objective of our research is to
   provide better, safer, longer lasting, more environmentally sound, and
   less costly transportation products.

   Another important function is more efficient operations though ITS
   technologies for advanced traffic operations, communications, vehicle
   detection, and camera technologies to provide real-time travel
   information. FHWA will expand its emphasis on operations to provide
   solutions to many of the challenges of the 21st century.

   Funding

   The Highway Trust Fund: The Federal Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is the
   principal source of funds for Federal surface transportation programs.
   Established by the Highway Revenue Act of 1956, and extended
   periodically through subsequent legislation, the HTF receives revenues
   from excise taxes on gasoline, diesel, and other motor fuels, as well
   as several excise taxes related to heavy trucks. The HTF has two
   accounts: Highway and Mass Transit. The programs of FHWA are supported
   by the Highway Account

   Program Activity: The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century
   and prior highway authorization acts provide for the apportionment and
   allocation of funding to the States in the form of contract authority.
   This allows the FHWA to enter into project agreements with States in
   advance of appropriations providing for cash reimbursements. The
   obligation of Federal funds constitutes the Federal government's
   commitment to pay a State for the Federal share of a project's cost,
   and occurs when a project is approved and a project agreement is
   executed. Annual spending is regulated through obligation limitation,
   which, in simplest terms, says that only a certain percent  of each
   dollar may be spent, or "obligated." This limitation allows Congress to
   respond to changing budgetary conditions while assuring continuity of
   the program. Reimbursements, or cash outlays, occur upon request by a
   State after costs have been incurred

   FHWA Vision: Create the best transportation system in the world.

   The FHWA, in partnership with the State, local and private
   transportation communities, is preparing for the future. Our vision is
   to create the safest, most efficient and effective highway intermodal
   transportation system in the world for the American peoplea
   transportation system where everyone has access within and beyond their
   community and to the world; a transportation system where crashes,
   delays, and congestion are significantly reduced; a transportation
   system where freight moves easily and at the lowest costs across towns,
   States, and international borders; a system which does not degrade the
   human and natural environment; a system that supports our country's
   national defense mobility; and a system where essential transportation
   services are restored immediately after disasters and emergencies.


   FHWA Mission: We continually improve the quality of our Nation's
   highway system and its intermodal connections.

   We carry out this mission by providing leadership, expertise, resources
   and information in cooperation with our partners to enhance the
   countrys economic vitality, quality of life, and environment.

   Goals

   For more than 100 years FHWA has concentrated on building and repairing
   the highway infrastructure. In the last decade of the 20th Century,
   FHWAs role expanded dramatically and is now reflected in six strategic
   goals, Safety, Mobility, Productivity, Human and Natural Environment,
   National Security, and Organizational Excellence

   Our goals are fully aligned with DOT's strategic goals, and our
   progress in achieving them will contribute to the overall
   transportation goals of the Nation.

   Safety: Continually improve highway safety

   Safety on our highways is our top priority. Tragically, more than
   41,000 Americans die, and 3.2 million are injured in motor vehicle
   accidents on our highways each year. As more people travel more miles
   on the highways and as the demographics of our driving population
   change, significant improvements in highway safety are essential to
   continue our progress in reducing highway fatalities and injuries.
   Safety is a key objective in all our programs and activities.

   Mobility: Continually improve the publics access to activities, goods,
   and services through preservation, improvement, and expansion of the
   highway transportation system and enhancement of its operations,
   efficiency, and intermodal connections

   Mobility, as much as any other factor, defines us as a Nation. Almost
   90 percent of all personal transportation takes place on highways. It
   connects people with work, school, community services, marketplaces,
   and each other. By connecting air, transit, rail, and port facilities
   and terminals, highways are the backbone of the Nations intermodal
   transportation system.

   Through this goal, we provide national leadership for continually
   improving the quality of our infrastructure and its operations. We
   research longer-life pavements, build more environmentally-friendly
   facilities, and use better techniques for reconstructing highways that
   minimize delays and maximize the capacity of our existing highways by
   improving operations of existing facilities.

   Productivity: Continuously improve the economic efficiency of the
   Nations transportation system to enhance Americas position in the
   global economy

   Transportation accounts for nearly 11 percent of our Nations gross
   domestic product. In our increasingly intermodal transportation
   network, highways are crucial in almost all freight movements, serving
   as connectors to water, rail, and air facilities. Approximately 70
   percent of all freight is transported over our highways.

   Despite the fact that the United States has one of the best
   long-distance highway networks, capacity problems, especially in large
   urban areas, are reaching critical proportions. At an average hourly
   operating cost of $40 to $60 for long-haul vehicle operations,
   disruptions can be costly to carriers and shippers and ultimately, to
   the consumer.

   Human and Natural Environment: Protect and enhance the natural
   environment and communities affected by highway transportation

   Transportation has major effects on our quality of lifewhere we choose
   to live and how we get to jobs, services, shopping, and recreation.
   FHWA enhances the community and social benefits of transportation by
   supporting welfare-to-work, mobility for people with low incomes, and
   accessibility for people with disabilities. FHWA also helps reduce the
   adverse effects of transportation on the natural environment by
   protecting wetlands, air quality, water quality, endangered species,
   and habitat.

   National Security: Improve the Nations national defense mobility

   The FHWA is committed to improving the Nations national defense
   mobility by improving the capacity and operation of the highway system.
   Highways are critical links for mobilizing and deploying military
   forces from U.S. bases to railheads, seaports, and airports.

   Sometimes, an emergency or destruction by natural disaster goes beyond
   local and State capabilities. In these situations, the Federal
   Government is called upon to help. The Federal Government provides
   State and local governments with personnel, technical expertise,
   equipment, and other resources.

   Organizational Excellence: Advance FHWAs ability to manage for results
   and innovation

   The FHWA Organizational Excellence goal recognizes and provides greater
   attention to the connection between how an organization operates and
   the results, i.e. outcomes, it is able to achieve. The new
   Organizational Excellence goal emphasizes not only the importance of
   quality management but also the importance of measuring how we do
   business in order to continuously improve our performance.

   Corporate Management Strategies

   FHWAs Corporate Management Strategies (CMS) serve as internal guidance
   designed to enable us to effectively and efficiently achieve our
   strategic goals. The CMS are based on the seven universally accepted
   criteria that comprise the Malcolm Baldrige and President's Quality
   Award criteria. These criteria are the strategies of the FHWA Quality
   Journey.

   Leadership: Strengthen the FHWA Leadership System, through training and
   other developmental initiatives, for the agency's new organizational
   structure

   FHWA leaders are responsible for leading the FHWA Quality Journey and
   for carrying out its Corporate Management Strategies. Leaders set the
   vision and direction, ensure accountability, and provide the resources
   to deliver the products and services to our customers in an excellent
   and timely manner.

   Strategic Planning:Translate strategies into unit, division, team, and
   individual action plans with performance measures based on the
   strategic objectives and performance goals

   Strategic Planning is essential to the long term viability of the
   Agency. FHWA Leadership uses the Strategic Plan to set the direction
   for the Agency, to prepare annual performance plans, and to allocate
   resources for attaining our strategic goals. The Plan is deployed
   throughout the Agency to the unit, division, team, and individual
   level.

   Customer/Partner Focus: Identify customer and partner needs and measure
   their level of satisfaction

   FHWA achieves success through extensive cooperation and partnering with
   State and local transportation agencies. We receive and act upon
   feedback from customer surveys, listening sessions, focus groups and
   other learning techniques. We use that information to improve products
   and services to ensure customer and partner needs are met.

   Information and Analysis: Identify and develop key business information
   systems that meet and track DOT and FHWA strategic goals

   FHWA needs information to support key processes and improve
   performance. Leaders create an environment in which knowledge, as a key
   asset of the organization, is managed, shared, and used effectively.

   Human Resource Development and Management: Increase employee technical
   competence, authority and the tools needed to meet agency and customer
   needs

   FHWAs successful performance depends on a work force with skills
   aligned with the Agencys objectives. We continue to develop and utilize
   the full potential of our human resources and to create an environment
   conducive to performance excellence and personal and organizational
   growth.

   Process Management: Design, manage, and improve key processes to
   achieve better performance

   FHWA uses customer-focused support, service and delivery processes to
   continually improve performance and enhance our products and services.
   We utilize employee appropriate feedback mechanisms and assessments
   from customers and partners.

   Business Results: Develop critical FHWA business metrics to measure the
   overall quality of processes and services and report results

   We will use customer feedback and benchmark high-performance
   organizations to continuously improve our overall performance for our
   customers.

  Safety

   Strategic Goal: Continually improve highway safety.

   Strategic Objective: Reduce the number of highway-related crashes and
   their consequences (fatalities and injuries).

   Fatalities and Injuries

   Highway-related crashes, injuries, and fatalities take a heavy personal
   toll on American families and cost the Nations economy more than $150
   billion annually. Over 41,000 Americans died in 2000 and over 3.2
   million were injured as a result of motor vehicle crashes.

   Performance Goal: Reduce the rate and number of highway-related
   fatalities and injuries. In FY 2002, FHWAs goal is to reduce the rate
   of highway-related fatalities to 1.4 per 100 million vehicle miles
   traveled and reduce the rate of injuries to 111 per 100 million vehicle
   miles traveled. These fatality and injury rate reduction performance
   goals are shared with the National Highway Traffic Safety
   Administration (NHTSA).

   In seeking to achieve the overall U.S. DOT goal regarding numbers of
   fatalities and injuries by the year 2008 [33,500 and 2,809,000,
   respectively], we are setting an FY 2002 benchmark of reducing the
   number of highway fatalities to 38,907 and reducing the number of
   highway injuries to 3.09 million.

   Performance Measures and Benchmarks:
     * Highway-related Fatalities per 100 million VMT

   External Factors: Vehicle travel is expected to grow at approximately 2
   percent per year. Fluctuations in VMT, as happened in 2000 when VMT did
   not grow, will affect fatality and injury rates. Lane mileage has
   increased less than ½ of 1-percent per year in recent years, which
   means more and larger vehicles will be competing for limited road
   space. In addition, the highest risk population groupsolder drivers and
   drivers aged 15 to 24will grow at faster rates than the overall
   population. In response to these and other external factors, FHWA works
   with other organizations such as NHTSA and the National Association of
   Governors Highway Safety Representatives (NAGHSR) to assure that a
   comprehensive approach to highway traffic safety is taken at the
   National, State, and local levels.

   2000 Results: Based on preliminary estimates (as of March 2002), DOT
   met neither the highway fatality nor injury rate target. The estimated
   41,800 fatalities in 2000 increased slightly (0.5%) from the 1999 total
   of 41,611.

   This creates a challenging situation for FHWA and other modal agencies
   within the U.S. DOT, as we continue to focus on programs and policies
   that can further drive these unacceptable numbers downward.

   Congress passed legislation to transfer FHWAs motor-carrier safety
   functions to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) as
   of January 1, 2000. As a result, FHWA no longer tracks indicators
   specific to large truck safety. We will continue to work closely with
   the FMCSA. Our efforts to reduce the occurrence and mitigate the
   consequences of crashes benefit all highway users.

   FY 2001 Performance Plan Evaluation: As stated in the "2000 Results"
   section, long-term reductions in fatalities and injuries appear to be
   leveling off. This situation presents serious challenges to achieving
   continuing progress in improving highway safety, and FHWA is responding
   aggressively through advancing programs that address leading causes of
   fatalities and injuries. For FY 2001, FHWA is directing resources to
   the focus areas of run-off-road crashes, speed-related crashes,
   intersection crashes, and pedestrian / bicyclist crashes. Further, in
   cooperation with the NHTSA, FHWA will also continue to support programs
   to increase seat belt use and reduce alcohol-impaired driving. In
   delivering these programs, FHWA will continue to work with the States
   to identify State-level opportunities to influence the National trends.

   Strategies and Initiatives to Achieve 2002 Goal: As pointed out above,
   FHWA and U.S. DOT share a challenging task in advancing our highway
   safety objectives. While we should recognize the reductions in rates of
   fatalities and injuries to which U.S. DOT programs have contributed,
   the safety community needs to intensify its focus on problem areas and
   efforts to pursue appropriate countermeasures. To further reduce
   crashes, injuries, and fatalities, attention must be placed on target
   crash types that most affect fatalities and injuries.

   To carry this approach forward, FHWA will focus on a set of
   infrastructure and operations topics that most affect fatalities on
   America's roadways. This is part of a comprehensive approach in which
   NHTSA focuses attention on issues such as driver training, prevention
   of impaired driving, and increasing the use of seat belts, and FMCSA
   carries out programs aimed at commercial motor carriers and drivers. In
   many of these areas, FHWA works in close partnership with NHTSA,
   NAGHSR, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
   Officials (AASHTO), and the National Association of County Engineers
   (NACE). For each of these topics, we seek to expand implementation of
   proven countermeasures and to develop and improve products which use
   advanced technology. We are actively investigating Intelligent
   Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies, including Intelligent
   Vehicle Initiative (IVI) elements, and deploying these products where
   appropriate.

   The focus areas that FHWA will concentrate on include:

   Single-Vehicle Run-off-the Road (ROR) Crashes - Typically caused by
   inattention, drowsiness, or avoidance maneuvers, ROR crashes are a
   contributing cause for 38% of fatalities. FHWAs two - pronged approach
   will concentrate efforts on both keeping vehicles within the roadway
   travel lane and minimizing harmful effects when vehicles do leave the
   roadway. Major initiatives relating to ROR crashes include improving
   pavement skid resistance, increasing the visibility of signs and
   pavement markings, increasing the use of rumble strips (where
   appropriate), upgrading roadside safety hardware (i.e., guardrail,
   crash barriers), improving design practices, and mitigating effects of
   utility poles and other roadside hazards.

   Intersections - Extensive work will be devoted to development of a
   comprehensive program to address crashes at or near intersections,
   which account for 23% of fatalities. Significant efforts in areas such
   as red-light-running, road safety audits, and intersection design are
   underway, and significant increases to address this overall issue are
   planned. In addition, intersection safety benefits from several related
   initiatives, such as speed management and pedestrian-oriented efforts,
   which are being undertaken jointly between FHWA and NHTSA.

   ITS/IVI products and technologies that hold strong promise to address
   intersection crashes are under development.

   Speed-Related Crashes - Speed contributes to 30% of fatalities, and
   FHWA and NHTSA work together on a comprehensive Speed Management Team.
   FHWAs activities will be focused in two main areas: 1) Promotion of
   variable speed limits, which use ITS tools for gathering speed and
   volume, weather, and road surface information to determine appropriate
   speeds at which drivers should be traveling given current conditions,
   and 2) Promotion of reasonable and safe posted (static) speed limits
   that are enforceable and accepted by the driving public as being set on
   a rational basis. We also conduct outreach to both the technical
   audience and the general public on speeding and its implications.

   Pedestrian / Bicycle Safety - The U.S. DOT supports making the Nation's
   roads safer for all road users, including bicyclists and pedestrians,
   who account for 13% of fatalities. FHWA and NHTSA will work with our
   partners to increase safe walking and bicycling by focusing on
   integrating pedestrian and bicyclist issues in the planning and design
   of facilities, researching and developing comprehensive countermeasures
   and appropriate tools and technologies, and implementing key
   recommendations from experts. FHWA will continue efforts to provide
   engineering and ITS approaches to increase the safety of bicyclists and
   pedestrians and accelerate the deployment of processes, tools and
   technologies to the State and local communities through showcasing,
   operational tests and evaluations, and public outreach campaigns.

   In addition to the four priority topic areas above which address
   specific crash types, FHWA will advance initiatives which improve
   overall safety design and management processes through efforts
   including:
     * Promoting Safety Management Processes - FHWA will facilitate the
       implementation of comprehensive safety management processes with
       Federal, State and local governments, Federal Land Management
       Agencies, Metropolitan Planning Organizations, and the commercial
       transportation industry.
     * Safety in the Planning Process Incorporating safety within State
       and local planning and programming processes was a required element
       of TEA-21, and FHWA is actively developing guidance on best
       practices and information on analysis tools that can be easily used
       by the planning community. These efforts will continue and advance
       in FY 2002.
     * Safety Data and Analysis Systems FHWA will work with our partners
       and stakeholders to develop information and analysis systems to
       better identify the causes of crashes and aid in the development of
       countermeasure designs that will reduce the number and severity of
       crashes. To aid in our internal development of high-payoff
       programs, we will investigate development of performance measures
       for each of the crash-type focus areas, so that we can determine
       our success in addressing these issues on a continuing basis.
     * Advancement of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and other
       Advanced Technologies The FHWAs long-term strategy is to approach
       highway safety improvements in a systematic manner that considers
       technology and human factors issues. Advances in ITS technologies,
       along with continued safety improvements to the overall roadway
       environment, will be a key part of safety initiatives.
     * Focusing on Outreach and Partnerships FHWA continues to advance our
       outreach and partnerships with others throughout the highway safety
       community to ensure that a comprehensive approach is taken in our
       efforts to reduce fatalities and injuries.

   Other Federal programs with common outcomes: Within the U.S. DOT, FHWA
   works closely with NHTSA and FMCSA toward the common objectives of
   reducing highway crashes, fatalities, and injuries. To both support
   these objectives and carry out highway safety efforts throughout the
   Federal government, FHWA also coordinates with a number of non-U.S. DOT
   agencies. These agencies include the:
     * National Academy of Sciences: The NAS, usually through the
       Transportation Research Board (TRB), supports key program areas
       through the creation of expert panels and committees that provide
       essential perspective and advice.
     * National Transportation Safety Board: The NTSB helps identify
       infrastructure enhancements to improve highway safety, and provides
       recommendations on program improvements.
     * Department of the Interior: As the highway system provider for the
       National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs, FHWA
       coordinates safety improvement for National Park and Native
       American Government roadway systems.

   Program Evaluation: In FY 2001, FHWA will evaluate selected highway
   safety improvement programs using a combination of longitudinal and
   cross sectional methodologies and benefit/cost analysis.

  Mobility

   Strategic Goal: Continually improve the public's access to activities,
   goods, and services through preservation, improvement, and expansion of
   the highway transportation system and the enhancement of its
   operations, efficiency, and intermodal connections.

   Strategic Objective 1: Preserve and enhance the infrastructure of
   Federal-aid highways and emphasis on the NHS.

   Pavement Condition

   The National Highway System (NHS) consists of only 161,117 miles of
   rural and urban roadsjust 4 percent of total highway milesbut carries 1
   trillion or 43 percent of vehicle miles traveled (VMT). The system
   serves major population centers, international border crossings,
   intermodal transportation facilities and major travel destinations. The
   condition of this system can affect wear-and-tear on vehicles, fuel
   consumption, travel time, congestion and comfort, as well as public
   safety. Improving the pavement condition is also important to the
   long-term structural integrity and cost effectiveness of the
   transportation system.

   Performance Goal: In 2000 the performance goal of 93 percent of the NHS
   pavements with acceptable ride quality (IRI = 170 in/mi) was met. The
   performance goal for pavement condition has been revised to more
   closely address mobility. NHS condition is now being evaluated in light
   of the vehicle miles traveled on the pavement. In FY 2002, our goal is
   to improve the condition of the NHS, to increase the percent of vehicle
   miles traveled on pavements with acceptable ride quality (IRI = 170
   in/mi) to 92 percent.

   Performance Measure/Target: Percentage of vehicle miles traveled on NHS
   pavements with acceptable ride quality (IRI < or = 170 in/mi), in 2002
   92%.

   Line graph entitled 'Percentage of Vehicle Miles Traveled on NHS
   Pavements With Acceptable Ride Quality.' The graph tracks an improving
   International Roughness Index through the years 1995 (88.1) through
   1999 (90.6). In addition, the graph presents an improved target IRI of
   92.5 for the year 2003. The data table from which the graph is derived
   is displayed immediately following.

              92.5

   External Factors: Growth in the U.S. economy has translated into over
   2% annual growth in VMT. While this level of growth did not occur in
   2000, it is too soon to tell if this is a change in the trend. In
   addition, industrys demand for heavier and longer trucks has increased
   pavement deterioration. A significant proportion of the NHS is over 20
   years old and nearly all of the system was designed to sustain loadings
   that have been exceeded for some time.

   2000 Results: 1999 data for NHS pavement condition showed 93.0 percent
   of the pavements had acceptable ride quality. Since this met the goal
   set for FY 2008, a team was charged with assessing the performance
   goal. The revised goal is designed to more accurately reflect mobility
   by including the percent of vehicle miles traveled on NHS pavements
   with acceptable ride quality (IRI < or = 170 in/mi).

   The focus of this measure of pavement performance is smoothness.
   Adopting more effective construction and maintenance methods and
   applying best practices in pavement management can improve pavement
   smoothness. In 1999, FHWA began a Pavement Smoothness Initiative to get
   the results of Research and Development and best practices in pavement
   construction and management to State DOTs and others involved in the
   construction and maintenance of highways. Pavement smoothness packages
   for both asphalt and Portland Cement Concrete pavements have been
   prepared. More than 3000 copies were distributed nationwide. These
   packages include videotapes by volunteer celebrity spokespersons
   Richard Petty, for asphalt pavements, and John Madden, for concrete
   pavements. Over 40 workshops were held to promote smoother pavement
   construction. Model specifications have been developed to assist State
   departments of transportation in improving pavement construction
   practices.

   FHWA is also promoting pavement preservation nationwide. This
   initiative will result in improved pavement smoothness, extended
   pavement life, and reduced life cycle cost. Efforts are also underway
   to promote pavement preservation practices to extend pavement life and
   improve condition. Work is also underway with the States to improve
   pavement condition measurement practices and equipment. This effort
   will increase the reliability of the data on which decisions on for
   pavement preservation and rehabilitation are based.

   FY 2001 Performance Plan Evaluation: Due to the significant increase in
   investment in pavement preservation and rehabilitation from the
   increased funding made available in TEA-21, and efforts to improve
   pavement condition, the ride quality of NHS pavements has improved
   faster than anticipated allowing us to reach 93% of the NHS with
   acceptable ride quality in 1999.

   A revised goal has been established. To better recognize customer
   focus, the revisions address users in addition to pavement condition by
   incorporating vehicle miles traveled on NHS pavements into the goal. In
   addition to reducing the mileage of the NHS with unacceptable ride
   quality, the revised plan also increases good ride quality pavements
   (IRI < 95 in/mi).

   Strategies and Initiatives to Achieve 2002 Goal: FHWA partners with
   State and other authorities to promote infrastructure development and
   improvement through direct funding, grants, and technical assistance
   and advances in construction, rehabilitation, maintenance,
   preservation, materials and management technology. FHWA technology
   deployment initiatives, in partnership with the States and industry,
   ensure advancements in pavement practices and high performance
   materials are adopted to improve the performance of NHS pavements.
   Initiatives to promote construction of smoother, longer lasting
   pavements and preservation that extends pavement performance will be
   continued. Innovations will be developed and delivered as they become
   available.
     * The FHWA Federal-aid Program provides funds for projects that
       improve NHS pavement condition through rehabilitation and pavement
       preservation. Most of the funding for these projects comes from the
       NHS and Interstate Maintenance (IM) programs. Over $6 billion in
       NHS funds and over $5 billion in IM funds will be obligated in FY
       2002.
     * The FHWA asphalt pavement technology program is optimizing
       materials selection to maximize the cost-benefits ratio associated
       with pavement design and construction. This program is funded at
       $6.2 million in 2002. Benefits include reduced maintenance, better
       ride quality, increased pavement life and reduced life cycle cost.
     * Results from evaluation of the effectiveness of using the Superpave
       system will be shared with States and industry to promote the
       continued use and development of the system.
     * In cooperation with Division Offices, an evaluation of the
       resources needed to achieve these revised goals will be undertaken.
       In addition, an implementation strategy will be developed to assist
       Divisions in evaluation of NHS pavement condition in their State
       and in working with the DOT to frame a local strategy for improving
       pavement condition by addressing unacceptable ride quality sections
       as well as increasing percentages of good ride quality (IRI = < 95
       in/mi) pavements.
     * FHWA will conduct pavement research and development, other than
       SUPERPAVE, and continue the Long Term Pavement Performance Program
       (LTPP). Planned activities include: (1) improved concrete pavement
       for highways, (2) use of LTPP performance data to develop new
       pavement design and evaluation tools (3) improved technology for
       specifying, measuring and constructing enhanced pavement ride
       quality and smoothness, and (4) investigating new techniques to
       analyze, image and simulate asphalt pavements to identify quality
       and predict performance.
     * FHWA, in cooperation with the States and the Industry, will
       continue to promote and publicize the results of the Pavement
       Smoothness Initiatives. Presentations will be made at regional and
       national meetings. Videotape presentations have been produced. A
       promotional display has been prepared promoting the benefits of
       smoother pavements and best practices for building and preserving
       them. The display will be used to aid in promoting these practices
       at technology fairs, State paving conferences, and trade shows.
     * Efforts will be pursued with profile measuring equipment
       manufacturers to offer equipment for measuring pavement smoothness
       using the recommended protocols at reduced prices to encourage
       equipment upgrades and adoption of recommended protocols.
     * In 2002, FHWA, through its Division Offices, will work with State
       DOTs to improve the quality of the pavement condition data
       collected.
     * In conjunction with the States and industry, FHWA will work to
       implement a program of extending pavement life. This activity will
       advance to practice the concept of the 50-year pavement system.

   Other Federal Programs with Common Outcomes: None.


   Bridge Condition

   Deficient bridges impair the publics access to activities, goods and
   services. The National Highway System (NHS) includes approximately
   114,000 bridges serving major population centers, international border
   crossings, intermodal transportation facilities and major travel
   destinations. Approximately 30.8 percent of the deck area on these
   bridges (for all average daily traffic (ADT)) is either structurally
   deficient or functionally obsolete (in terms of dimensions, load, or
   other characteristics). Of the approximately 472,000 non-NHS bridges
   identified in the National Bridge Inventory (NBI), 32.6 percent of the
   deck area (for all ADT) is considered to be deficient.

   Performance Goal and Result: In FY 2002, improve the condition of NHS
   and non-NHS bridges taking into account deck area and ADT. (Improve NHS
   deficient bridges deck area to 28.9 percent; and improve non-NHS
   bridges deficient deck to 31.2 percent.)

   Please see specific targets for FY 2002 by specific ADT breakdowns
   under the section "Strategies and Initiatives to achieve 2002 Goal."

   Performance Measure/Target: Percentage of NHS Bridges deck area

   External Factors: Growth in the U.S. economy has translated into over
   2% annual growth in vehicle miles traveled, increasing the stress on
   bridges. While this level of growth did not occur in 2000, it is too
   soon to tell if this is a change in the trend. In addition, increases
   in truck traffic and the aging of our infrastructure contribute to the
   deficiencies in our Nations bridges.

   2000 Results: According to our 2000 NBI data, the percentage of
   deficient NHS bridges was 21.5%, exceeding the FY 2000 target of 22.5%.
   This 1.5% decrease between 1999 and 2000 is primarily due to improved
   data collection for the NHS. Prior to 1995, NHS data was collected
   based upon FHWAs best estimate, by functional classification, of the
   number of bridges located on the NHS. In 1995, a data item was added to
   the NBI that tracked the NHS bridges. The new data item was fully
   populated by the States in the year 2000 NBI submittal. This resulted
   in a more accurate tracking of the NHS bridges. As a result of the
   improved accuracy of our data, the actual number of NHS bridges
   decreased significantly. Because it was apparent we would be
   accomplishing our original target early, FHWA began to determine a
   revised goal that more directly relates to mobility.

   FY 2001 Performance Plan Evaluation: Based on program performance in FY
   2000, the targets established for FY 2001 of improving the condition of
   the nations bridges will need to be adjusted to reflect the improved
   data in the NBI. In addition the FHWA is reviewing this particular
   performance goal and measure to assure that we are on track and
   measuring the right indicator in regards to the nations mobility.

   Strategies and Initiatives to Achieve 2002 Goal: A primary strategy for
   FY 2002 will be to obtain buy-in from all the Division Offices and
   Resource Centers, customers, stakeholders and partners for this new
   performance goal and measure. This will be done through information
   provided from the Office of Bridge Technology to our Divisions/Resource
   Centers; briefings to AASHTO and our partners and simple explanations
   of the validity of the new measure relative to the way projects are
   planned. FHWAs division offices will need to become more familiar with
   their NBI data in regards to its implications for mobility. The Office
   of Bridge Technology and the Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center
   will be providing detailed analyses of the NBI data for each State.
   Strategies and initiatives will be devised to work with the States on
   improving the condition of bridges that most heavily impact the
   mobility of the American public. The following national targets have
   been set to improve the condition of NHS and non-NHS bridges taking
   into account ADT:
    1. On NHS routes with an ADT more than 50,000, improve deficient
       bridges deck area from 44.5% in 1998 to 27.4% by 2008. The target
       for 2002 is 38.4%.
    2. On NHS routes with an ADT of zero to 50,000, improve deficient
       bridges deck area from 29.1% in 1998 to 20.8% by 2008. The target
       for 2002 is 25.3%.
    3. On non-NHS routes with an ADT more than 10,000, improve deficient
       bridges deck area from 47% in 1998 to 32.1 by 2008. The target for
       2002 is 41.3.%
    4. On non-NHS routes with an ADT of zero to 10,000, improve deficient
       bridges deck area from 29.9% in 1998 to 25.5% by 2008. The target
       for 2002 is 28.2%.

   FHWA will continue to provide technical assistance and funding to
   States for bridge replacement and rehabilitation. In addition, all
   regulations and policies pertaining to the bridge programs will be
   reviewed and recommendations provided, where feasible, to increase
   flexibility in the use of bridge funds for system preservation and
   bridge management system initiatives. FHWA will work with States and
   other partners in both the public and private sector to improve
   management of bridge assets. FHWA will focus research on improving the
   technology of bridge construction, repair and maintenance. FHWA
   technology deployment initiatives will support the adoption of
   advancements in high performance materials and seismic retrofit
   techniques that improve the performance of bridges.
     * The FHWA Federal-aid Highway programs provide funds for projects
       that improve the condition of NHS and non-NHS bridges. Through the
       Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program, $4.4 billion
       will be provided in FY 2002.
     * The Surface Transportation Research program provides durable
       structural materials, nondestructive evaluation technologies for
       condition assessment in support of bridge management and technical
       assistance, all of which lead to extended bridge service life. A
       total of $9.4 million is requested for these activities in FY 2002.
     * Innovative bridge research supports the deployment of innovative
       materials which are more durable and resistant to traffic loads and
       corrosive attack, resulting in less maintenance and traffic
       restriction. The FY 2002 innovative bridge construction program
       demonstrates the application of innovative materials on selected
       bridges.

   Other Federal Programs with Common Outcomes: None.

   User Satisfaction

   FHWA is committed to excellence in service to its customers and
   partners. It is important to understand highway users perceptions of
   how well highways, as part of the Nation's intermodal transportation
   system, meet their needs.

   Performance Goal:In FY 2002, increase overall user satisfaction with
   the Nations highway systems to 70%.
   Performance Measure/Target: Percent user satisfaction with the Nations
   highway systems.

   2000 Results:The level for Overall Highway User Satisfaction increased
   from 50% to 66%, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics
   Omnibus Survey. The top 3 stated priorities for improvement based on
   the 1995 and 2000 survey are shown in the chart below:

   Line graph entitled 'Overall User Satisfaction.' The graph shows that
   user satisfaction with the Nation's highway systems increased from 50%

   FY 2001 Performance Plan Evaluation: No changes are proposed at this
   time, with the exception of possibly using two identical questions on
   Overall Satisfaction in 2002 Survey (one question to be asked at the
   beginning of each interview and the follow-up question to be asked at
   the end of the interview).

   Strategies and Initiatives to Achieve 2002 Goal:
     * 2002 Satisfaction Survey
     * Satisfaction Improvement Initiatives. These initiatives could
       include workshops, best-practices guides, community-of-practice
       websites, training courses, AASHTO and Industry involvement,
       National Partnership for Highway Quality involvement, etc. Focus
       areas include:
          + Congestion (Traffic Flow)
          + Work Zone Operations
          + Pavement Conditions
          + Community Oriented Improvements
          + Maintenance Response Time

   Strategic Objective 2: Improve the operation of the highway systems and
   intermodal linkages to increase transportation access for all people
   and commodities.

   Congestion and Delay

   Congestion is a problem. Over the last two decades, the amount of
   travel has increased significantly. Growth in roadway capacity however
   has almost flat-lined at a meager 0.3% a year in the last decade. The
   costs of congestion are adding up. In 1997, the individual cost of
   congestion in metropolitan areas exceeded $900 per driver, resulting in
   over $72 billion in lost wages and wasted fuel. In the near-term, the
   FHWA will focus on improved, active and real-time operations of the
   existing transportation system (including accommodations for
   non-motorized users), which can result in short-term reduction in
   travel time and delay of between 10-30% depending on a variety of local
   conditions.

   Performance Goal: In FY 2002, slow the projected growth of congested
   travel from 33.9% to 33.7%, slow the projected growth of travel time
   from 27.6% to 27.2% and slow the projected growth of traveler delay
   from 34.5 hours to 34.0 hours.

   Performance Measure/Target:

   The projected growth of congested travel.

   Understanding the Table:

   The percentage of congested travel measures undesirable traffic
   congestion. For instance, the 1996 figure tells us 32% of daily travel
   occurred under congested conditions. Our goal is to slow the growth of
   congested travel by 0.2% each year. Based on historical trends coupled
   with a preliminary analysis of 2000 data, we project the rate of
   increase will be 0.5% per year for 2000-2002. The 2002 target is based
   upon meeting the 2001 target.
   Line graph entitled 'Percentage of Travel Under Congested Conditions.'
   The graph shows an increasing percentage of congested travel, from
   32.0% in 1996 to 32.6% in 1999. A target is established of 33.4% in
   2001 and 33.7% in 2002, representing the goal of a slowing of congested
   travel by 0.2% each year. The data table from which the graph is
   derived is displayed immediately following.

   Performance Measure/Target
   The projected growth of travel time.

   Understanding the Table:
   The Travel Time Measure addresses the following question "How much
   longer does it take me to travel during congested conditions?" The
   measure focuses on the additional travel time necessary for an
   individual to make a trip during the peak period(s) because of
   congestion. For instance, the 1996 figure of 23% indicates the average
   peak period trip took 23% longer than the same trip in uncongested
   conditions. Put simply, a 30-minute trip traveling at the posted speed
   limit(s) in uncongested conditions becomes 36.9 minutes due to
   congestion. Our goal is to slow the growth of travel time by 0.4% each
   year. Based on historical trends coupled with a preliminary analysis of
   2000 data, we project the rate of increase will be 1% per year for
   2000-2002. The 2002 target is based upon meeting the 2001 target.
   Line graph entitled 'Percentage of Additional Travel Time.' The graph
   shows the increasing time of slowed travel during peak periods, from
   23.1% in 1996 to 25.5% in 1999. A target is established to slow this
   increasing time from 25.5% in 1999 to 27.6% in 2002, representing the
   goal of a slowing the rate of increase by 0.4% each year. The data

   Performance Measure/Target

   The projected growth of traveler delay

   Understanding the Table:
   The graph identifies the average number of hours drivers are stuck in
   traffic per year. The hours of delay reflect congestion, work zones,
   incidents and accidents. From 1996, delay increased approximately
   1-hour per year. Our goal is to slow the growth of delay time by
   30-minutes each year. Based on historical trends coupled with a
   preliminary analysis of 2000 data, we project the rate of increase will
   be 1 hour per year for 2000-2002. The 2002 target is based upon meeting
   the 2001 target.

   Line graph entitled 'Annual Hours of Delay.' The graph shows the
   increasing time of slowed travel during peak periods, from 23.1% in
   1996 to 25.5% in 1999. A target is established to slow this increasing
   time from 25.5% in 1999 to 27.6% in 2002, representing the goal of a
   slowing the rate of increase by 0.4% each year. The data table from
   which the graph is derived is displayed immediately following.
