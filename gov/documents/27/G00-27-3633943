   Statement of U.S. Secretary of Education Rod Paige Regarding Final
   Passage of S. 1762
   FOR RELEASE:
   January 24, 2002 Contact: Jane Glickman
                    Stephanie Babyak
                    (202) 401-1576
   On behalf of America's college-bound students and their parents, I
   would like to thank the members of the House of Representatives for
   joining their Senate colleagues in taking decisive bipartisan action to
   extend current law to keep interest rates affordable for student and
   parent borrowers. By acting now, Congress has enhanced the stability of
   a student financial aid program that students and their families across
   the country depend upon in order to find affordable financing for
   postsecondary education. I congratulate and thank them for anticipating
   the needs of America's students and families.

                                     ###
