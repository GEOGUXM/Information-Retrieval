                    Herpetology is the study of amphibians and reptiles.


   [clearpixel.gif] [clearpixel.gif]

   The Herpetology Project was created  in the mid-1970's. The project
   began with studies that assessed the status and distribution of
   amphibians and reptiles in threatened Florida biotic communities. Since
   then, our research has expanded to focus on  the life histories,
   diversity, and importance of amphibians and reptiles in a wide variety
   of Southeastern  and Caribbean ecosystems.

   USGS/FCSC scientists have pioneered the development of herpetofaunal
   community sampling techniques, now adopted throughout the world. Since
   the mid-1980s, research has centered on communities, guilds, and
   individual species, focusing especially on the status of Southeastern
   amphibians, the ecology of amphibians and reptiles inhabiting the
   endangered longleaf pine community of the Coastal Plain, the management
   and restoration of island herpetofaunas, and the life history of
   declining, endangered, and threatened species, including the federally
   protected Red Hills salamander, flattened musk turtle, and loggerhead
   sea turtle.
   We have employed the latest scientific techniques, either through our
   in-house expertise or collaboration, including the implementation of
   biometrically-based community inventory and monitoring programs,
   population modeling, telemetry (radio and satellite), genetic analysis,
   and database management. We anticipate continued emphasis on a
   multidisciplinary approach to long-term studies on the biology of
   amphibians and reptiles inhabiting the imperiled ecosystems of the
   Southeastern United States and Caribbean.
