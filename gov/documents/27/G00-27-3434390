  Goal: To acquire a geographically and seasonally diverse database of Level II
  data and, if available, other ancillary data for the purpose of meteorological
  research related to, but not limited to, studies of severe/hazardous storms
  and the development and testing of Doppler radar based meteorological
  algorithms.

                              *** ATTENTION ***

  Disclaimer: The NSSL and the OSF are NOT responsible for the dissemination of
  these data (in regards to Level II data) to other agencies or the public.
  These data are meant for internal (NSSL, NWS/OSF) use ONLY. All inquiries
  regarding Level II data availability and acquisition should be directed to the
  National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). Inquiries and orders may also be
  directed to orders@ncdc.noaa.gov.

   Partners: The WSR-88D OSF and the NSSL are the primary fiscal
   supporters of the Level II database.

   [line_red.gif]

   Currently, a total of 1760 Level II data tapes reside within the NSSL
   and the OSF. Events identified on these data sets include hurricanes,
   tornadoes, hail, severe winds, squall lines, and winter weather events
   to name a few. This database is dynamic in that it continues to grow as
   our need for large amounts of data continues especially in light of the
   development and testing of meteorological algorithms.

             NEXRAD Event/Tape Tracking System (NETTS or NEXCAT)

   Note: Due to the increasing size of the database, users may experience
    slow response to user requests or certain search requests may timeout
    without any results. These problems are expected to be alleviated as
          the web server is upgraded.(this message posted 4/5/00).

   The NSSL has developed a search utility to find in-house Level II data
   that matches specified criteria. Storm reports that occurred during the
   capture of the Level II data are also contained within the database,
   and they are accessible via NETTS. Note that the source for the storm
   reports is primarily derived from the SPC Smooth Log.

                     NCDC's Storm Event Search Utility.

   Use this search utility to identify specific, recorded storm events
   according to various search criteria such as state, storm event type,
   time, data, dollar value of damage, injuries, etc. Note that the storm
   events have not been associated with any archived data. All recorded
   storm events since January 1, 1950 are available. [line_red.gif]
