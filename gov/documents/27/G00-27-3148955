   Foot and Mouth Disease

   Bull Elk The ongoing pandemic of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) in Europe
   and other parts of the world is of great concern to the North American
   Agriculture Community. FMD may also pose a significant threat to North
   American wildlife. This Alert is intended to provide natural resource
   and wildlife conservation managers information about the disease, web
   based resources about FMD and information about the potential risk to
   wildlife.

   While foot-and-mouth-disease (FMD) is primarily an economically
   devastating disease of domestic livestock, experimental studies have
   clearly demonstrated that it also threatens wildlife. North American
   wildlife including white-tailed deer, other deer species, feral pigs,
   bison, moose, antelope, peccaries, musk ox, caribou, sheep and elk are
   susceptible to FMD. USGS scientists are concerned about this potential
   threats.

   Wildlife Disease Specialists at the USGS National Wildlife Health
   Center are monitoring the outbreak in Western Europe and other parts of
   the World and gathering information from numerous sources. Specialists
   are interacting with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and
   working with US Department of Interior land management and conservation
   agencies to provide information on disease status and risks and assist
   in developing FMD prevention and contingency plans.

   For more information on Foot-and-Mouth Disease, you can contact: Dr.
   Scott Wright, USGS, National Wildlife Health Center at 608-270-2460 or
   Paul Slota, USGS, National Wildlife Health Center at 608-270-2420.
