   Physics of the muon EDM Experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory:
   We are proposing a new method to carry out a dedicated search for a
   permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of the muon with a sensitivity
   at a level of 10^{-24} e cm. The experimental design exploits the
   strong motional electric field sensed by relativistic particles in a
   magnetic storage ring. As a key feature, a novel technique has been
   invented in which the g-2 precession is compensated with radial
   electric field. Muon Spin Precession without Electric Field
   Compensation and with Electric Field Compensation. The EDM signature is
   the time dependent muon spin precession vertically: Vertical Muon Spin
   Precession, observed with the following Detection Method of the Muon
   Spin Direction.

   The standard model of particle physics is a very successful theoretical
   framework, which describes all confirmed observations to date. However,
   the model leaves important questions concerning the physical nature of
   observed processes unexplained, although it provides an accurate
   description of them. Among the not yet understood phenomena are the
   reasons for parity violation, the particle masses, the violation of the
   CP symmetry. CP violation is the only known mechanism that could
   explain the matter antimatter asymmetry found in the universe. In order
   to obtain a deeper insight, speculative models have been suggested
   which often are connected to observable deviations from standard theory
   predictions, particularly violations of assumed symmetries or yet
   unknown properties of particles. The spectrum of these theories
   includes super symmetry (SUSY), left-right symmetry, multi Higgs
   scenarios and many other important approaches. For more details go to
   Physics of EDM. For a short description of the Muon EDM experimental
   concept go to Short Paper on EDM.
