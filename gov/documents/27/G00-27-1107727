   The mission of the Library of Congress is to make its resources
   available and useful to the Congress and the American people. Through
   its Web sites, the Library is offering broad public access to a wide
   range of information, including historical materials that may contain
   offensive language or negative stereotypes. Such materials must be
   viewed in the context of the relevant time period.

   For site security and to ensure that this service remains available to
   all users, this government computer system employs software programs to
   monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or
   change information, deny service, otherwise cause damage, or access
   non-public information. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or
   change information are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under
   the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National
   Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996. Information regarding possible
   violations of law may be provided to law enforcement officials.

   For site management, this computer system uses software programs to
   create summary statistics that are used for such purposes as assessing
   what information is of most or least interest, determining technical
   design specifications, and identifying system performance areas. The
   Library of Congress collects and stores the following information:
     * The name of the domain from which you access the Internet
     * The date and time you access our site
     * The pages you peruse and files you access
     * The Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly
       to our site

   If you choose to provide us with personal information, as in an e-mail
   message, the Library of Congress will use this information to respond
   to your request. There are times when your e-mail is forwarded within
   the Library to employees who are better able to assist you. The Library
   may also forward requests for assistance to another appropriate
   institution for response. Except for the foregoing exceptions and for
   authorized law enforcement activities, the Library does not share
   e-mail with outside organizations without obtaining your permission.

                     About Copyright and the Collections

   Whenever possible, the Library of Congress provides factual information
   about copyright owners and related matters in the catalog records,
   finding aids, and other texts that accompany collections. As a publicly
   supported institution, the Library generally does not own rights in its
   collections. Therefore, it does not charge permission fees for use of
   such material and generally does not grant or deny permission to
   publish or otherwise distribute material in its collections. Permission
   and possible fees may be required from the copyright owner
   independently of the Library.

   It is the researcher's obligation to determine and satisfy copyright or
   other use restrictions when publishing or otherwise distributing
   material founds in the Library's collections. Transmission or
   reproduction of protected items beyond that allowed by fair use
   requires the written permission of the copyright owners. Researchers
   must make their own assessments of rights in light of their intended
   use. More information about U.S. copyright law (Title 17 U.S. Code) is
   provided by the Copyright Office.

   The Library of Congress wants to hear from any copyright owners who are
   not properly identified on this Web site so that we may make the
   necessary corrections.
