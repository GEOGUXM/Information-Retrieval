                    We Have Only Just Begun [bar1.gif]

                    California Millennium Conference 2000 Keynote Address

   Dr. Kevin Starr, State Librarian of California, gave the Keynote
   Address at the California Millennium Conference in Santa Clara,
   California on November 11, 2000. His presentation, "We've Only Just
   Begun," looked at the history of California and the California dream
   through the perspective of California's books, its libraries, its
   librarians and the people they serve. Come along on this journey and
   see how the printed - and now electronic - word has shaped the romantic
   and evocative image of a Golden State, its progress, problems, and
   destiny.

   Dr. Starr concludes with a challenge for California's libraries and
   librarians on what their future can and will be.
