   Airport Planning & Design Research

   The purpose of this program area is to advise airport operators and
   their consultants of appropriate dimensional standards for airport
   development and to provide planning guidelines for developing landside
   and airside facilities.

   The airport landside includes the terminal complex and access system.
   These facilities provide transition between ground and air
   transportation modes.

   Airside facilities refers to the number and orientation of runways,
   taxiways and the location of terminal areas relative to runways.

   Passenger enplanements are expected to more than double during the next
   25 years. In addition, major aircraft manufacturers have recently
   proposed super-jumbo and stretch versions of their existing aircraft.
   The increased passenger traffic and larger aircraft will severely
   strain existing airports. The major areas of concern include terminal
   and gate configurations, runway and taxiway geometry, pavements,
   baggage handling systems, service vehicles, parking, airport access
   roads and modes, and the cost for updating these facilities.

   Emphasis is currently being placed on new large aircraft, terminal
   building planning, and facilities and systems for passenger access to
   airports.
