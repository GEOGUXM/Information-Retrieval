Tax Filing Assistance

     You can have the IRS figure your federal tax on Form 1040EZ, Form
     1040A or Form 1040 if you file your return by April 15, 2002.

     If you paid too much, you will receive a refund. If you did not pay
     enough, you will receive a bill for the balance. You must pay the
     bill within 30 days of the date of the bill or by the due date for
     your return, whichever is later.

     The IRS will also figure the credit for the elderly or the disabled
     and the earned income credit.

     There are exceptions. The IRS cannot figure your taxes under certain
     conditions. To find out more about this, see IRS Publication 967,
     The IRS Will Figure Your Tax.

     Tax assistance is also available for persons 60 years and older who
     are confined to their residences or retirement communities.
     Volunteers through the American Association of Retired People
     provide this assistance. For more information about this, visit
     AARP.

Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and
Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE)

     Help others during tax time through the VITA Program.
     * Free:  IRS provides free training in basic tax law and asks that
       you volunteer 20 hours of your time.
     * When:  Classes start in January
     * Where:  Call your local IRS office
     * Contact:  VITA coordinator

     During the filing season, free help from volunteers is available in
     most communities. After completing IRS training and FTB training,
     these volunteers help prepare current year basic tax returns for
     taxpayers with special needs, including low-income people, persons
     with disabilities, the elderly and non-English-speaking people. At
     some of these offices, you can file your tax return electronically.

     Visit the IRS website for the location of the volunteer assistance
     site near you. Or, for the location of an American Association of
     Retired Persons (AARP) Tax-Aide site in your community, call (888)
     AARPNOW or visit their website.
