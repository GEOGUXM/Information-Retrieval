            Lindsey, Weinberger Woo GOP Hill Support For Tax Cuts

   11:45:47, 26 April 2001

   WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Lawrence Lindsey, President George W. Bush's
   top economic advisor, and Mark Weinberger, assistant secretary for tax
   policy, met with Republican legislators Thursday to coordinate efforts
   to pass a tax-cut bill.

   The officials met in closed session with about 20 legislators on the
   Republican Policy Committee, then spoke to reporters afterward along
   with Reps. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., and Dick Armey, R-Texas. The
   group didn't endorse a specific number for the tax cut, but endorsed
   efforts to pass "as much tax relief as possible" in the near future.

   The plan is to "get the president's plan enacted and get it out as soon
   as possible," Weinberger said. The officials also talked about the
   possibility of future tax legislation, during the current legislative
   session as well as in coming years. Changes to the capital-gains tax
   was listed as a current goal, along with long-term hopes for
   comprehensive tax-code simplification.
