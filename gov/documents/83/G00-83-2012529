REAL CHOICE SYSTEMS CHANGE GRANTS
                __________________________________________________________________

   These systems change grants represent a major new initiative to promote
      the design and delivery of home and community-based services that
      support people with a disability or long term illness to live and
   participate in their communities. Congress and the Administration have
               made $50 million available for this initiative.

       Medicaid home and community-based services play an increasingly
        critical role in enabling individuals of all ages who have a
      significant disability or long term illness to live fuller, more
      self-directed lives in their own homes and communities than ever
     before. Despite continuing progress on this front, however, States
   wishing to improve the availability and quality of these services still
         face significant challenges. Accordingly, Congress and the
   Administration have envisioned a new grant program to assist States and
    the disability and aging communities to work together to find viable
     ways to expand such services and supports. The new grant funds are
       meant to be used to bring about enduring system improvements in
   providing long term services and supports, including attendant care to
   individuals in the most integrated settings appropriate to their needs.

    The "Starter Grants" represent the first grant opportunity under the
   Real Choice Systems Change initiative. Details of the "Starter Grants"
   and the four future grant solicitations, that we collectively refer to
   as the "Systems Change" grants, are further described in the Questions
                            and Answers document.
