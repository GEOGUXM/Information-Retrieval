   This was the first in a series of meetings to discuss what is and can
   be done with the data for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The next
   meeting will probably be held at the University of Chicago sometime in
   October 1998. Some information about this meeting is given below.

                     Brian Yanny -- Introduction to Data

                callibrated objects sit on disks of fits files

                corrected frames archived to tapes or robot

                in their place are atlas images + sky frame
                      together they can be used to reconstruct full frame
                 ---------------------
                May dark run 2 nights: PSF poor star galaxy poor
                                                                astrometry good
                                                                600,000 stars r'
 < 23.5

                June dark run: 80 square degrees, nearly filled rectangle
                                                        211 < RA <  253
                                                Should have ~800 QSO < 19
                                                PSF much better determined
                                                Good star/galaxy separation
                                                Several examples of frames/bands

c, relies on 2-fold
                                                                        symmetry
                                                25% of objects are blended
                ------------------------------------

                Showed luminosity functions in different bands
                Equal numbers of stars/galaxies at 20th mag. After that
                galaxies drop, artifact of identification. Should be
                rise in galaxies at faint mags.

                -------------------------------------


                Showed color diagrams; look reasonable

                ------------------------------------

                plot stars vs frame number. Get blip at Pal 5
                globular cluster. Early science: look for correlations
                in star counts

                ---------------------

                working on zero point calibration between columns, appear to be
                off by tenth of mag between columns.In a given column, offset
                is only few hundredths of magnitude.

                ------------------

                standard fits readers should work. Documentation at

                1] message 44 on sdss-obs mailing list

                2] http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~rhl/photomisc

                each object has many different descriptors

                -------------------

                Every bright object has mask file, which at present is difficult
 to
                decode. Eventually this will be available

                               Albert Stebbins

            In ~stebbins/bin/ look for sdssOBJfileReadCat
            a way to read the files

                 Allyn Smith -- Calibration ... White Dwarfs

            CALIBRATION
        Std Stars / 40 inch calibration observations at Flagstaff
        ---------------------
        many holes in red and blue ends
        plugged some of the holes but most extreme red and blue holes
        remain. Similarly with other colors.
        Getting good coverage over 5 different months
        ---------------------
        dust ring at flagstaff lead to 6/100 mag error if image
        is right on top of it.
        ---------------------
        no important differences as focus changes
        ---------------------
        As object moves across chip, no errors [as opposed to
        early runs on MT]
        ---------------------
        On 40'', can't find some of the standard stars; should
        be fixed soon. Ross 530, finding the wrong star [fixed].
        ---------------------
        Comparisons of 24'' and 40'' agree very well
        ---------------------
        Reilluminizing MT changed zero points by ~.2 mags.
        Cleaning "whenever needed." Want it done regularly, once
        a month or every other month.
        ---------------------
        Tim McKay: variations seen in z band. Do you see this in standard
                   star?
        Smith:     See variations day to day, and from morning to evening.
                   Haven't looked carefully yet

                         Allyn Smith -- WHITE DWARFS

        Looking for WD luminosity function, good way to date age of galactic
        disk. [Now gives 9.7 Gyr]. In u-g-r locus WD fall close to rest of
        stars. In g-r-i subdwarfs fall out [g-r ~ 2]. Most important for
        aging at L/L_solar = 10^{-5} are inseparable from ordinary stars
        using Sloan colors.

                    Heidi Newberg -- G Star Metallicities

            Showed ways of star/galaxy separation using colors. Galaxies always
            "on top" in u-g-r.
            G stars with same metallicities line up in u-g-r: method of determin
ing
            metallicities from SDSS colors. Models suggest that knowledge of
            colors to a few percent gives metallicities to .5 decs.
            USNO data shows fainter --> lower metallicity
            Should be able to determine metallicity of every G star in [u-band]
survey
            to within .5 dec. Will sample thin disk, thick disk, and halo stars
            to see if metallicities change.

                 Chris Stoughton -- Simulations for Science

                Described simulations, will soon be documented,released
                ---------
                Test: choose a shape,scale length, mag,axis ratio, position angl
e
                For 100 objects, compare "observed" signal with input, find
                few percent error in mag for exponential disk,20% with deV bulge
 if
                scale length is 5 pixels.
                ---------
                Used to test pipeline. Can we measure PSF magnitudes? Test deble
nder.
                ---------
                QUASHNOCK: Put in weird shaped galaxies, what comes out?
                STOUGHTON: Haven't done it.
                McKAY: Can you take custom object and run it through PHOTO?
                STOUGHTON: Yes, uses JPGTest.
                STEBBINS: Where to put the files?
                YANNY: June data is 400 GBytes
                STEBBINS: Might get 100GB disk to do analysis on.
                Discussion of how such a disk would be managed,placed?
                STEBBINS: FNAL Theory group might get involved in this.

                               BREAK FOR LUNCH

                 Jonathan Loveday -- Star-Galaxy Separation

                Comparison of Ssx magnitudes with PHOTO, quite a big spread and
                even a bit of bias. All done withMay data, should get better.
                Part of this discrepency is also due to different mags [Kron
                vs Petrosian]
                Star likelihood on May data is completely uncorrelated (PHOTO
                and Ssx), again because PSF is not well-known.
                ------------------------
                Investigated different algorithm. Flux in annuli vs magnitude.
                Even on May data, with 1.5'' seeing, do much better, can separat
e down to 21st mag.
                New algorithm does about as well on the May data as PHOTO does o
n
                June data.

                STOUGHTON: Does this mean for target selection 1.5'' seeing is
                good enough?

                Will quantify all this with June data.

               Douglas Tucker -- Correlation Function w(theta)

                Use
                        DD/DR - 1
                N^2 operation. Can go to counts-in-cell statistics for large ang
les

                2 Advantages:

                -- statistics

                -- 55'' fiber separation loses close pairs; adaptive tiling will
 help
                   here.

                At small distances (less than a Mpc) the correlation function is
 affected
                by the fiber separation

                ---------------------------------

                Want to study clustering vs morphology, say vs galaxy color
                and concentration index. Clustering of faint galaxies can be don
e
                in Southern strip.

                DODELSON: Stebbins, Frieman and I are writing code to get w.
                Would be nice to use Chris' simulations to test it, especially
                accounting for mask. Also need luminosity function to get accura
te
                window function in order to compare with theory.

       Douglas Tucker -- Search for Dwarf Spheroidals in galactic halo

                Milky Way has 9 DS satellites.

                Armandropf et al preprint : took POSS-II images and wrote softwa
re to
                find DS. Might also use adaptive kernel technique for searching.

                MCKAY: Might check on binned sky images. Can look in 3 colors
                TUCKER: Most evident in bluer bands.

                     Tim McKay -- Photometric Redshifts

                Most work being done by Connolly/Szalay; meeting 8-24/25.
                Get \delta z \simeq 0.03

                No other survey w/ comparable numbers w/ 5 colors

                ----------------------

                Want to obtain redshifts for high z galaxies to calibrate estima
tor.
                LCRS galaxies, Johnson color data , observed fields w/ previousl
y measured
                redshifts.

                Ultimately get spectra for 1500 objects down to r ~ 22, need 4m
                telescope.

                ----------------------

                How to do it:
                        1] fit polynomial to colors

                        Did this @ Michigan ; got the right numbers for LCRS gal
axies.

                        2 runs on Schmidt in 5 SDSS colors, get 2600 galaxies wi
th
                        colors. Data useful in of itself, i.e. for looking at st
ellar
                        locus.

                        2] template fitting [Connolly]

                        Goal of JHU meeting to get official SDSS color-z techniq
ue.

                        YANNY: Problem if no detection in u-band
                        MCKAY: Only need u at low redshift, where you will proba
bly get them
                                   anyway.
                    QUASHNOCK: How far out will the relation be valid?

                          Tim McKay -- Weak Lensing

                Many things can produce non-random orientations. Use stars to me
asure
                instrumental distortions, then remove these from galaxies. Need
to account
                for shear -- all size change shape the same -- and smear -- chan
ge of
                shape depends on size. SDSS desgined to have little distortion,
little
                shear. To measure PSF, PHOTO spits out (Q,U) for every object [w
eighted
                momnts of brightness]. Stability in space and time is very impor
tant.
                In each column, there is variation across chip in amplitude on t
he order
                of 5%.

                ---
                NEWBERG:How does this affect star/galaxy separation?
                ---

                PSF changes as a function of time, but changes are correlated ac
ross
                whole camera.

                ----------------------------

                Even though SDSS does not go deep, statistics are fine because o
f
                large area. Clusters at z ~ 0.1 will give most of the lensing.

                ----------------------------

                Science:

                1] clusters
                                Johnstone has developed simulations to test code
s and predict
                                signals. Results: 10 sigma detections of objects
 with velocity
                                dispersions of 800 km/sec assuming 1'' PSF (Gaus
sian).

                                Elliptical objects circularized by PSF, amount c
alled "dilution
                                factor." If galaxy size is .7'', dilution factor
 becomes large
                                at seeing > 1.5''.

                                Various weighting schemes give different dilutio
ns but similar S/N.
                                Use adaptive wieghting schemes to get same dilut
ion for all S/N.
                                Advocate using this adaptive weighting for other
 things, i.e.
                                galaxy shapes. Might be able to do this with atl
as images. If not,
                                PHOTO could do it.

                                YANNY: If you want PHOTO to change, tell us soon
.

                                Will get through May/June data in next few month
s. If there is signal,
                                can correlate with known object or with dark obj
ect. All these subject
                                to large scale systematics.


                  Albert Stebbins -- Galaxy-Galaxy lensing

                can determine mass profile of galaxies: halo profile. This is le
ss prone
                to systematic effects since instrumental effects on small scales
 are
                small and there are so many galaxies that they wash out random
                instrumental effects.

                Used Joffre's software SExtractor to get prob of given object be
ing star.
                Looked at 14000 galaxies from May data. Expect distribution of a
ngles to
                be uniform. Plot -- for galaxies separated by 2-4'' -- maximum s
eparation
                of observed cumulative distribution and random cumulative distri
bution.
                They don't agree but the result is opposite what a "signal" woul
d produce.
                Hard to know how to analyze this. For galaxies separated by 6-24

   Fellow SDSS Participants

   Now that SDSS data exists there are many people in the Chicago area who
   are starting to look at it as well as trying to glean some science from
   this data. We are organizing an informal get together at Fermilab on
   (somewhat along the lines of the meetings going on in Princeton) where
   people may discuss what they are doing with the data, and what they
   have found, both in terms of science and data quality. This would be a
   one-day meeting, aimed mostly at Chicagoland residents, but of course
   open to anyone in the collaboration.

   The specifics are

                   WHEN : Friday, 14 August 1998, ~9AM-4PM

                    WHERE: 1 East, Wilson Hall, Fermilab

   At the moment all we would like from you is an indication if you think
   you might attend and also if there is something you would like to
   present - or want to hear presented. Please reply by e-mail to
   "ssc@simone.fnal.gov". Expect a 2nd announcement with more specifics in
   a week or two which will also be sent to the "sdss-general" mailing
   list. A web site with URL

                   www-astro-theory.fnal.gov/Personal/ssc/

   will be set up soon for up-to-the-minute information on the agenda.

   Fellow SDSS Participants

   This is the 2nd and final announcement for the first Sloan Science in
   Chicago meeting, date and time above. Further details can be found at
   the web site

                   www-astro-theory.fnal.gov/Personal/ssc/

   The meeting is informal and should contain both presentations and
   round-table discussion. Where you think it might be useful we would
   encourage anyone to bring up any unfinished work or incomplete ideas. A
   rough (and evolving) agenda is as follows
    Status of the First Light data                Brian Yanny

    Use of the Sloan Data Simulations             Chris Stoughton
    for Science

    Star-Galaxy Separation                        Jon Loveday

    Using the Sloan to Find Dwarf                 Douglas Tucker
    Spheroidals in the Galactic Halo

    Photometric Redshifts                         Tim Mckay

    Weak Lensing                                  Tim Mckay

    Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing                         Albert Stebbins

   A few people have expressed interest in talking about stars - but have
   not quite come out of the closet. Any additions before the meeting will
   noted on the web page.

   SPECIAL NOTE: The good news is that we are able to use the rather
   classy new 1 East conference room. The bad news is that absolutely no
   food or drink are allowed in this room. Don't despair though - since
   the cafeteria is only steps away one can easily pop out for a quick cup
   of coffee.

   The list of participants is as follows
     Scott Dodelson
     Phil Fischer
     Evalyn Gates
     Don Lamb
     Jonathan Loveday
     Tim Mckay
     Heidi Newberg
