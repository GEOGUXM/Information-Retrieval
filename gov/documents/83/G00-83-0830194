   Senior Investigator: David R. Davies

   Affiliation: Section on Molecular Structure, LMB, NIDDK.

   Research: Current interests include protein-protein interactions as
   exemplified by antibody-antigen interactions, further studies on the
   HIV integrase, tryptophan synthase enzyme system, and cytokine-receptor
   interactions.

   Equipment and Resources: the group has a large wetlab and cold room,
   with separate office space. The X-ray and some computer equipment is
   shared with the other crystallography groups in the building.
