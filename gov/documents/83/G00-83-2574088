   Abstract

      Elastic photon scattering is an important tool for obtaining
      information about the structural properties of matter. The programs and
      data presented here are useful for evaluating Rayleigh scattering, the
      contribution to elastic scattering made by the bound electrons of an
      atom. Rayleigh scattering dominates elastic scattering for most of the
      x-ray and low-energy gamma-ray regimes. Most of the data available at
      this site are based on the anomalous-scattering-factor (ASF)
      approximation, although more sophisticated S-matrix predictions are
      available as data files. For a more detailed discussion of these and
      other approximations to scattering, see

   Data Files

      Also see ftp://www-phys.llnl.gov/pub/rayleigh/README.txt for additional
      information.

      You may directly access text files containing differential elastic
      scattering tables on a relatively dense grid in scattering angle (97
      points on 0-180 degrees), photon energy (56 points on 0.0543-2754 keV),
      and atomic number (all Z on 1-99). These data are available via
      anonymous ftp from

   ftp://www-phys.llnl.gov/pub/rayleigh/

   stored in files with names of the form

   model[+NT]_zzz

   where

   model - model for Rayleigh amplitudes
       SM => S-matrix method for inner-electrons
       MFASF => MF w/angle-independent anomalous scattering factors
       RFASF => MF w/angle-independent anomalous scattering factors
       MF => modified relativistic form factors, g(q)
       RF => relativistic form factors, f(q)
       NF => non-relativistic form factors, f(q), Hubbell et al. (1975)
   +NT - optional, indicates that nuclear Thomson amplitudes are included
   zzz - 3-digit atomic number (e.g., 006 => Carbon)

   For example,

   SM_006 - contains S-matrix predictions for Carbon,
   RFASF_029 - contains MF+ASF predictions for Copper,
   NF+NT_050 - contains NF Rayleigh predictions (including NT amplitudes)
   for Tin.

   You may also directly access files containing the supporting
   form-factor and anomalous-scattering-factor data on dense variable-step
   grids for:

     * anomalous scattering factors, f', f''
     * modified relativistic form factors, g(q)
     * relativistic form factors, f(q)
