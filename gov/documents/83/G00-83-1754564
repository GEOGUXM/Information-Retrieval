                              OPM Web Privacy Policy

   Thank you for visiting the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) web
   site and reviewing our privacy policy. Our privacy policy is clear: We
   will collect no personal information about you when you visit our web
   site unless you choose to provide that information to us.

   Here is how we handle information about your visit to our web site:

   Information Collected and Stored Automatically

   If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the web site,
   read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
   information about your visit automatically. This information does not
   identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the
   following information about your visit:
    1. The Internet domain (for example, youragency.gov if you connect
       from a government domain, yourschool.edu if you connect from a
       university's domain, or xcompany.com if you use a private Internet
       access account) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is
       automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing
       the Web) from which you access our web site;
    2. The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
    3. The date and time you access our site;
    4. The pages you visit; and
    5. If you linked to our web site from another web site, the address of
       that web site.

   We use this information to help us make our site more useful to
   visitors to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the
   types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record
   information about individuals and their visits. We do not enable
   "cookies." (A "cookie" is a file placed on your hard drive by a web
   site that allows it to monitor your use of the site.)

   If You Send Us Personal Information

   If you choose to provide us with personal information as in an email to
   one of our online email boxes, or by filling out a form with your
   personal information and submitting it to us through our web site we
   use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you
   the information you have requested. We treat emails the same way we
   treat letters sent to OPM, but we do not collect personal information
   for any purpose other than to respond to you. We collect personally
   identifiable information (name, email address, Social Security number,
   or other unique identifier) only if specifically and knowingly provided
   by you. We only share the information you give us with another
   government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as
   otherwise required by law. Moreover, we do not create individual
   profiles with the information you provide or give it to any private
   organizations. We do not collect information for commercial marketing.

   Links to Other Sites

   Our web site has links to other federal agencies. We also link to other
   organizations web sites when we have a good business reason to do so.
   This does not constitute an endorsement of their policies or products.
   Once you link to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of
   the new site.

   Site Security

   We ensure that our web site remains available to all users by using a
   Government computer system that employs software programs to monitor
   network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change
   information, or otherwise cause damage.
