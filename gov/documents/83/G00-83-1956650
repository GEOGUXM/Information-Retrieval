           Statement by Commerce Secretary Don Evans on Taiwans Entry
                         Into the World Trade Organization

      On January 1, Taiwan officially became the 144^th member of the World
      Trade Organization.

      I congratulate Taiwan on this historic achievement.

      Taiwans accession to the WTO will further open Taiwans market to
      American exports of industrial goods and services, including key
      telecommunications and financial services sectors.

      The average Taiwan tariff on industrial products will be cut from 6
      percent to less than 5 percent, and Taiwan also will liberalize its
      agricultural trade sector.   It will open its procurement market to
      U.S. bidders in areas such as power‑generation, transport and power
      transmission services.  Taiwan will also eliminate tariffs in the
      aircraft sector and select aircraft suppliers based on commercial
      considerations only.

      Taiwan has joined the WTO at a historic moment, and we look forward to
      its full participation in future WTO work.
