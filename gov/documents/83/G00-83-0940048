   Progress against cancer is measured in two ways: by the increase in
   knowledge about it and by the reduction in the burden of this disease.
   The "burden" of cancer is determined by many measures, including the
   number of cases each year (incidence), survival rates, the number of
   deaths, and probabilities (the chance of being diagnosed or dying from
   cancer). For most of the 20th century, cancer incidence rates and death
   rates increased, but early in the 1990s, these rates began to decline.

   NCI recently published the Atlas of Cancer Mortality in the United
   States, 1950-94, http://search.nci.nih.gov/search97cgi/s97_cgi , a
   survey of cancer-specific mortality rates in all 3,000 U.S. counties.
   In addition, NCI's SEER program (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
   Results) publishes a review of cancer statistics each year. The most
   recent edition of statistics
   http://seer.cancer.gov/Publications/CSR1973_1997 covers the period
   between 1973 and 1997. Both are excellent resources for learning more
   about cancer-related statistics.


   The Burden of Cancer
   [cleardot.gif]
   [cleardot.gif]
     Almost 1.27 million people will be diagnosed with cancer in the year
   2001: an estimated 643,000 men and 625,000 women.

     Nearly 43 percent of men and 38 percent of women in the United
   States will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime.

     In 2001, about 553,400 people are expected to die from cancer:
   286,100 men and 267,300 women.

     Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States,
   exceeded only by heart disease.

    Nearly 80 percent of all cancers are diagnosed at ages 55 and older.

     People who die from cancer lose an average of 15.1 years of their
   lives.

     The number of cancer survivors is growing. About 8.9 million people
   in the United States are living with cancer. This includes people who
   have been diagnosed recently and are undergoing treatment as well as
   those who have completed treatment.

     The direct medical costs of treating cancer is estimated to be about
   $60 billion per year.

   Reduction in the Burden
   [cleardot.gif]

   Cancer rates overall reached a peak in the early 1990s - after steadily
   increasing since 1950, when reliable statistics first became available
   - and are now declining. The incidence and death rates during the early
   to mid-1990s paint a picture of the progress that is being made.

   All cancers combined

   From 1950 to 1990, the incidence rate for all cancers rose more than 45
   percent and the death rate rose 10 percent. Between 1990 and 1996, the
   rate of new cancer cases declined an average of nearly 1 percent each
   year. The cancer death rate fell, on average, 0.6 percent per year
   during that same period. Overall five-year survival rates for people
   with cancer have increased from 35 percent in 1950-54 to almost 60
   percent in 1989-95. Most of the decline in cancer death rates can be
   attributed to decreases in deaths from lung, colorectal, prostate, and
   breast cancers.

   Major Sites

   

   Lung cancer
   Lung cancer is the most frequently diagnosed nonskin cancer in men and
   women, with 90,700 new cases expected in men this year and 78,800 cases
   in women. Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer death; this
   year alone, 90,100 men and 67,300 women are expected to die from lung
   cancer. Decreases in lung cancer incidence and death rates are due to
   the decreased rate of smoking over the past 30 years. Fewer than 25
   percent of adults now smoke, compared with 42 percent in 1965.

   The incidence rate of lung cancer is declining significantly in men,
   from 86.5 per 100,000 men in 1984 to 69.1 in 1997. In the 1990s, the
   increasing trend of lung cancer incidence in women leveled off near the
   1997 rate of 43.1 per 100,000 women.

   The 1-year relative survival rates for lung cancer increased from 34
   percent in 1975 to 41 percent in 1996.

   

   Breast cancer
   Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed nonskin cancer in women
   (an estimated 192,200 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected
   this year) and the second leading cause of cancer death among women
   (40,600 deaths expected this year). About 1,500 new cases and 400
   deaths are expected in men from this disease. An additional 46,400 new
   cases of in situ breast cancer are estimated for 2001. Of these, 88
   percent will be ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

   Between 1950 and 1990, breast cancer incidence rates increased 52.3
   percent before leveling off in the 1990s. From 1990 to 1997, incidence
   increased, on average, only 0.4 percent per year. During the same
   period, however, mortality rates dropped 2.1 percent per year: 2.4
   percent for white women and 0.2 percent for black women. Breast cancer
   incidence rates may be continuing to increase slightly in white women.

   The widespread incorporation of breast cancer screening into routine
   medical care and the increased use of adjuvant therapy may account for
   the overall decreased rate of death. (Adjuvant therapy is treatment
   given after the primary treatment to make it work better. The treatment
   may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or hormone therapy.)

   The 5-year relative survival rate for localized breast cancer increased
   from 72 percent in the 1940s to 97 percent today. (The "relative
   survival rate" is the survival rate observed for a group of cancer
   patients compared to the survival rate for persons in the general
   population who are similar to the patient group with respect to age,
   gender, race, and calendar year of observation. The 5-year relative
   survival rates include persons who are living 5 years after diagnosis,
   whether in remission, disease-free, or under treatment.)

   

   Prostate cancer
   Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed nonskin cancer in men
   (an estimated 198,100 cases this year) and is the second most common
   cause of cancer death in men (31,500 deaths expected this year).
   Changes in the incidence and mortality rates for prostate cancer are
   likely due to several interrelated factors.

   From 1950 to 1990, the prostate cancer incidence rate more than
   doubled, and there was a dramatically sharp increase between 1989 and
   1992 - likely due to the sudden use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
   testing in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which could diagnose
   previously undetected cancers. On average, however, incidence decreased
   2.1 percent each year between 1990 and 1997. (Actually there was a 3.0
   percent decrease each year for white men; in black men, incidence
   increased 0.7 percent each year during that period.)

   From 1950 to 1990, the prostate cancer death rate increased 17.8
   percent overall. However, it has been decreasing in the 1990s. From
   1990 to 1997, mortality rates decreased 2.2 percent each year (2.4
   percent each year for white men, 1.1 percent for black men).

   The 5-year relative survival rate for prostate cancer, all stages
   combined, has increased from 67 percent in 1974-76 to almost 93 percent
   today. According to recent data, 72 percent of men diagnosed with
   prostate cancer survive 10 years and 53 percent survive 15 years.

   

   Colorectal cancer
   Colorectal cancer is the third most frequently diagnosed nonskin
   cancer, and the third most common cause of cancer death for men and
   women (after lung, prostate, and breast). About 67,300 men and 68,100
   women will be diagnosed with the disease this year, and 27,700 men and
   29,000 women will die from it.

   From 1950 to 1990, the incidence rate for colorectal cancer increased
   9.9 percent, but incidence has been decreasing since then. From 1990 to
   1997, incidence rates dropped 1.7 percent per year. The decrease was
   better for men (2.0 percent each year) than women (1.5 percent).
   Researchers are not sure exactly why colorectal cancer rates are
   decreasing. The use of fecal occult blood testing and sigmoidoscopy
   screening tests remains low, signaling that factors other than
   screening tests are at play. Increased removal of polyps (which often
   become cancerous), better treatments, and other factors may be
   contributing.

   From 1950 to 1990, the death rate for colorectal cancer decreased 28.2
   percent. From 1990 to 1997, death rates for colorectal cancer declined
   1.8 percent per year. During each of those years, however, the decrease
   for whites (1.8 percent) was more than twice that for blacks (0.8
   percent).

   The 5-year relative survival rate for colorectal cancer increased from
   50 percent in 1974-76 to 61 percent in 1989-97. The5-year survival rate
   for localized colorectal cancer is 90 percent; however, only 37 percent
   of these cancers are discovered at an early stage.

   Problem Areas

   Although overall cancer rates are declining-led by declines in cancer
   rates for the major cancers above- the rates of two major cancers,
   melanoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, are still rising.

   Since 1950, melanoma incidence rates have increased fivefold and
   mortality rates have more than doubled. From 1990 to 1997, incidence
   rates increased 2.6 percent per year. Incidence rates are more than 10
   times higher in whites than in blacks. Among the strongest risk factors
   for melanoma is a history of sunburns, which are preventable. This
   year, about 51,400 cases of melanoma will be diagnosed and 7,800 people
   will die of the disease.

   Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) incidence rates nearly tripled between
   1950 and 1995, and death rates more than doubled. During the 1990s, the
   rate of increase appeared to slow. Between 1990 and 1997, incidence
   increased about 0.6 percent per year. About 56,200 people will be
   diagnosed with NHL this year and 27,700 will die of the disease. Part
   of the increase in rates is due to AIDS: NHL is about 60 times more
   common in AIDS patients than in the general population. Researchers are
   looking at other possible causes as well.

   Statistics are from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance,
   Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) report, and from the American
   Cancer Society's Cancer Facts and Figures 2001, which contains
   estimates based on SEER data. For more information about cancer, visit
