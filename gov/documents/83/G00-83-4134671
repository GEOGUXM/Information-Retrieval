                   2001 BASE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE REPORTED
                        FOR CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS

          SACRAMENTO-State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine
     Eastin today released the 2001 Base Academic Performance Index
     (API), which for the first time is specifically linked to California
     content standards.

          "Today we have reached a major milestone in the development of
     the statewide accountability system. This is the first significant
     change in the API since its inception in 1999," said Eastin. "As a
     result of this inclusion, the API is now broader and richer, giving
     us a more comprehensive look at how our schools are performing."

          The 2001 Base APIs include results from the California
     Standards Test in English Language Arts (CST ELA), which was given
     in spring 2001. Previous APIs had relied solely on results from the
     national, standardized norm-referenced Stanford Achievement Test,
     Ninth Edition (Stanford 9). The 2001 Base API determines the targets
     for the spring 2002 testing and provides new school rankings.

          The API Internet reports for schools will be posted beginning
     at 9 a.m. today on the California Department of Education (CDE) Web
     site at:

                            http://api.cde.ca.gov

          For a typical elementary or middle school (grades 2 through 8),
     results from the CST ELA will now constitute 36 percent of the API
     and for a typical high school (grades nine through eleven), they
     will constitute 24 percent of the API. The remainder of the API will
     consist of results from the Stanford 9.

          "This will be the pattern for the foreseeable future," Eastin
     said. "We will be adding more and more standards-based tests as the
     data become available. All of this will be accomplished within the
     existing structure of the API."

          Over the next few years, the API will incorporate other
     California standards tests as well as the California High School
     Exit Examination. Eventually, the API will include graduation and
     attendance rates.

          Please note: Because the 2001 Base API includes the new
     California standards-based English Language Arts test and because
     the calculation of the 2001 Base API is different from the 2001
     Growth API calculation, any comparison of the two would be
     inappropriate.

          This fall, schools that meet their 2001-02 API growth targets
     and make at least five points growth (four points for all
     numerically significant subgroups) will be eligible for
     consideration for API-based awards programs. Schools that fail to
     meet their growth targets and receive a 2001 API statewide rank of 1
     to 5 will be invited to participate in the Immediate
     Intervention/Underperforming Schools Program (II/USP).

          The API is the cornerstone of the Public Schools Accountability
     Act (PSAA-Senate Bill 1X), a Governor Gray Davis-sponsored bill
     signed into law in April 1999. This law authorized the establishment
     of the first statewide accountability system for California public
     schools. The system includes three major components: the API, the
     II/USP, and the Governor's Performance Award program.

          The purpose of the API is to measure the academic performance
     and progress of schools. It is a numeric index that ranges from a
     low of 200 to a high of 1000. The 2001 API establishes this year's
     baseline for a school's academic performance and sets an annual
     target for growth. The state has set 800 as the API score that
     schools should strive to meet.

          The results of the 2001 Base API are as follows: The statewide
     median elementary school score is 690. The median middle school
     score is 669; and the median high school score is 636. Approximately
     18 percent of schools statewide are at or above the 800 mark.
     Specifically, about 21 percent of elementary schools, 15 percent of
     middle schools, 5 percent of high schools, and 14 percent of small
     schools attained this score.

          "Again, it is clear that the bulk of our efforts is in the
     elementary and middle schools, which have had the advantage of many
     of the state's education reforms," Eastin said. "As we incorporate
     more and more standards-based tests, our high school students will
     have a real opportunity to improve their scores and their overall
     academic performance."

          The reports available online will include the 2001 API Base
     scores, statewide and similar schools rankings, and annual growth
     targets for elementary, middle, and high school that have 100 valid
     student scores from the Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR)
     test. Reports for schools with fewer than 100 valid student scores
     (but more than 10) have APIs marked with asterisks. The asterisk
     indicates the greater statistical uncertainty of an API based on
     fewer than 100 test scores. Small school API reports do not include
     similar schools rankings.

          The release of the 2001 Base API reports marks the beginning of
     the third reporting cycle. This current reporting system presently
     encompasses about 7,400 schools, with the remainder participating in
     an alternative accountability system.
