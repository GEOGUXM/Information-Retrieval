   Questions/Comments
   A spot bid sale combines methods of both sealed bid sales and auctions.
   The bidder must be present for the sale, as bids will be solicited
   orally. The bidder will write his bid on a bid card and turn it in. All
   cards will be sorted, and the high bidder will be announced before
   moving on to the next item.

   The Invitation for Bid (IFB) may be viewed below by clicking on the
   Spot Bid Sale Number. The IFB contains item descriptions, sale terms
   and conditions, and item inspection times and location.

   Scheduled Sales: NO SALES SCHEDULED AT THIS TIME.




   NOTE:   SHUTTLE LAUNCH DATES MAY AFFECT INSPECTION AND SALE DATES. FOR
           CURRENT STATUS, CALL 321-867-7027.
