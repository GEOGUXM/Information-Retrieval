                          Introduction to the MBone
     __________________________________________________________________

   Since the MBone software and tools are developed at a diverse set of
   sites, it is difficult for the novice user of MBone videoconferencing
   to determine where to begin. This page is intended to help people in
   getting started in using the multicast backbone (MBone) for
   videoconferencing. It provides

          [redball.gif] List of items needed to participate in a MBone
          Session
          [redball.gif] MBone tools and binaries
          [redball.gif] User guides for the MBone tools
          [redball.gif] Useful and required peripherals
          [redball.gif] Links to MBone Sites
          [redball.gif] Reference books and papers

   The best way to get started in using the Mbone is to first review the
   section containing the list of items needed to participate in a MBone
   Session. Then pick up the binaries for your platform from the tools and
   binaries section and install them. To learn how to use each of the
   tools refer to the user guides for the tools.

   Many of the comments on these pages are written in the first person,
   but do not be fooled--this is not the experience of any one single
   person. The first person is used only as a narrative convenience.

   If you would like to contribute to this page or for more pages like
   this one but about other tools, see the ESCC Application Working Group
   home page.

   controller tools for adding remote control capabilities to
   videoconferencing.

[question.gif] What do I need to participate in a MBone Session ?
     __________________________________________________________________

   The MBone is still somewhat experimental and is not yet available on
   every operating system and subnet by default. The easiest way to
   determine if you are able to receive multicast packets on your local
   machine is to run sdr. If the list of sessions has entries in it and
   they stay in the list for more than ~20 minutes then you are on the
   MBone and your machine is receiving MBone broadcasts so skip 1 & 2
   below. In order to participate in an MBONE session you need a few
   things :
    1. A multicast capable kernel. Many of the operating systems now come
       multicast capable. There are patches available for many of the
       operating systems that are not delivered multicast capable.
    2. Your subnet needs to be on the MBONE. In other words, multicast
       packets need to be being forwarded to your machine. The easiest way
       to check if you are on the MBone is to run the sdr tool and see if
       any sessions show up. Run it for about 10 minutes and if nothing
       shows up in the session list you are not on the MBone!
    3. The multicast videoconferencing applications. You need a minimum of
       sdr, vic, and vat (or rat). It is also nice to have wb on hand.
          + Sdr provides you with a session directory and video conference
            launching tool.
          + Vic is the video tool; vat and rat are audio tools.
          + wb is a whiteboard application that is sometimes used to send
            slides or for feedback.
       (Sdr and rat were developed at UCL. Vic, vat, and wb were
       originally developed here at LBNL by Van Jacobson's group. UCL is
       also maintaining updated versions of vic.)
    4. Multicast debugging tools are also helpful in diagnosing problems.
       the primary tools available are mtrace, mrinfo, and rtpmon. Mtrace
       allows you to do a multicast traceroute from a receiver to the
       source of a multicast on a particular address. Mrinfo allows you to
       query a multicast router and determine its local configuration.
       Rtpmon allows you to monitor the RTP receiver reports as they are
       received. NOTE: mrinfo and mtrace have to run as root.

   NOTE :
   It is a really bad idea to remotely log into a machine and start up vic
   and vat on the remote machine because you will not get audio and the X
   protocol is horribly inefficient at remotely displaying vic windows and
   will bring an ethernet to its knees.

   As a further note, if you are connecting via an ISDN line from home
   there may be some things you need to do to get routing of multicast
   packets over the ISDN line. You will also probably want the video
   transcoder to convert the video to a lower rate format before sending
   it down the ISDN line.

[search.gif] Peripherals for MBone videoconferencing
     __________________________________________________________________

   To participate in a videoconferencing session over the MBone there are
   a few things that you need. The following section will give you some
   idea of the minimum requirements to be a participating member in a
   videoconference (not just listen in) and lists some of the hardware we
   have used and like.
     * Minimum audio requirement - You will need an audio card capable of
       at least half-duplex sound, full-duplex sound capabilities are
       preferred. You will need a microphone and a speaker or headphones.
       The microphone and speaker may be built-in and almost any quality
       mic and speaker will work. A set of PC speakers and a cheap mic are
       our standard setup.
     * Audio add-ons - If you are going to videoconference alot and want
       the conversations to be somewhat natural then you really need
       hardware echo cancellation. There are some reasonably priced units
       out there. We have tried the Coherent Callport and the Polycom
       SoundPoint PC for offices and small rooms. We have recently been
       experimenting with a new vat that has lower timing thresholds when
       in external echo cancel mode and the Polycom has had fewer false
       turn-ons due to echo than the Coherent. One source for these units
       is PicturePhone Direct. They are also available in some computer
       stores. For information about how to use the Polycom, click here.
     * Audio extremes - The above echo cancellation units are a mic and a
       speaker built into a single unit to provide a fixed distance for
       echo cancellation. The higher-end hardware echo cancellers allow
       separate microphones and speakers and of course come with a higher
       price tag. Both Coherent and Polycom sell high-end units as well.
       What we have bought for use in large conference rooms with several
       mics and speakers is the Coherent VoiceCrafter.
     * Minimum video requirements - You will need a video capture card
       (usually with S-video and/or RCA input jacks) and a camera. The
       camera can be just about anything that can generate a video signal.
     * Video niceties - A camcorder works well for capturing video since
       it allows you to have zoom, brightness and white balance control to
       make the best of less than optimal video capture situations (like
       dark rooms).
     * SunVideo+ card - The SunVideoPlus card can be used on the new Sun
       Ultras that have a PCI bus. The SunVideoPlus card and driver are
       available from Sun Microsystems. Since the SunVideo+ is really a
       MultiMedia Access Corporation Osprey-1100/1500 video card, it is
       also available from MMAC. See "Vic: Hardware and operating system
       specific tips" below.
     * Video extremes - There are many situations where it is nice to have
       a camera that can be controlled remotely. The Sony EVI-D30 is
       really the cat's meow of videoconferencing cameras. It has built in
       pan/tilt/zoom/focus and can be controlled using an infra-red remote
       or RS-232. It also has some limited subject tracking and motion
       detection capabilities. One source for the Sony EVI-D30 camera is
       PicturePhone Direct. The Canon VC-C3 is also a very nice camera
       with features very similar to the Sony camera. Software for
       controlling the Sony and Canon cameras can be obtained from
       http://www-itg.lbl.gov/mbone/devserv.
       If you are using multiple cameras in your setup it is also nice to
       have an RS-232 controllable video switcher. We use the Panasonic
       WJ-MX50 which can also do picture-in-picture. Software for
       controlling the Panasonic can be obtained from
       http://www-itg.lbl.gov/mbone/devserv. We have also used the Sierra
       Video RS-232 controllable video switch but it is not as nice as the
       Panasonic. Panasonic also makes a WJ-MX20 as well but we have not
       yet written the software to allow remote control of this switcher.
     * Media Cards - We have found that the Hauppauge Wincast/WinTV video
       card and AW35 Pro 3D sound card (Crystal CS423x audio chipset) work
       under both freeBSD and Windows95/98/NT. To install the drivers for
       these cards under freeBSD-3.1, please see How To Get Video and
       Audio Cards Working under FreeBSD 3.1 .

[file_trans.gif] Tools and Binaries to download
     __________________________________________________________________

   This site is not a mirror site and is instead manually maintained so
   there are no guarantees that it contains the latest versions of the
   tools, binaries for all architectures, or all the possible tools. This
   site is simply meant to help get you started. The groups that are most
   actively developing new versions of the MBone videoconferencing tools
   are the MASH group at UC Berkeley and the UCL Multimedia Research
   Group, so you might want to check their sites for binaries first.

   To go to the ftp directory for a particular architecture just click on
   the architecture. If the architecture or binary you are looking for is
   not listed it probably exists at the actual site building and
   maintaining the individual tools so try the WWW pointers. For brief
   explanations of what each of the tools are used for see the list of
   items needed to participate in a MBone Session. To learn how to use the
   tools refer the guides to the tools.

   There are versions of MBone binaries in this directory for the
   following architectures/operating systems.

     * bsdi
     * freebsd
     * hpux
     * sgi
     * Solaris 2.x
     * sunos
     * win95

   The corresponding manual pages are in Manual pages.

   If you want additional tools not listed above, other places to look
   are:
     * CORE2000 at Pacific Northwest National Lab, a Java-based
       videoconferencing environment that offers tools that include an
       electronic notebook, a TeleViewer, and support for the Macintosh
       platform.
     * The MICE project in Europe offers older tools that include mmcc,
       nv, ivs, and others.
