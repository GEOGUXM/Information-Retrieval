   Remote collaboration means a late evening in Los Alamos, and the
   morning the next day in Japan. You can still get jet-lagged even doing
   remote collaborations, when the time difference is large between
   countries!

   A US-Japan collaborative effort to make time and space-resolved
   measurements of the 14 MeV neutrons produced in DT reactions has been
   successful. 14 MeV neutrons are generated by the collisions of
   fusion-product tritons (originating from DD reactions) with background
   deuterium fuel, in the deuterium fueled tokamak. Triton burnup, the
   process of the d(d,p)t triton fusion reaction product being confined,
   slowing down, and possibly undergoing a t(d,n) "burnup" reaction, is a
   very sensitive measure of single-particle confinement and fast ion
   transport in reactor-like plasmas. These neutrons must be detected in a
   background of low-energy (2.5 MeV) neutrons and accompanying gamma
   rays.

   A compact scintillating fiber detector {photo} has been developed as a
   prototype of a directional neutron detector with excellent
   discrimination against gamma-rays. Such detectors are desired for
   fusion burn profile determination on future devices like ITER.

   The Los Alamos design was optimized to be able to measure the 1% or
   less 14-MeV neutron emission from triton burnup on present-day
   deuterium tokamak experiments. The device was modeled by W. C. Sailor
   of TSA-3 and Cris W. Barnes (P-24 Plasma Physics ) at LANL, designed by
   G. A. Wurden and R. E. Chrien of P-24, and manufactured by EG&G Las
   Vegas. Almost simultaneously with fabrication, a prototype detector was
   tested with neutron sources at LANL and EG&G. A pair of
   detectors{photo} is in each collimator box. One was used in DT
   conditions on the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor at the Princeton Plasma
   Physics Laboratory .

   In March 1994, a set of four directional 14 MeV scintillating fiber
   neutron detectors, developed at LANL , were installed on the Japanese
   large tokamak experiment, JT-60U {photo} . For the Japanese experiment,
   four detectors were arranged in two borated-polyethylene
   collimators{photo} with two sight-lines. All total, one thousand pounds
   of equipment was shipped to the JAERI Naka Fusion Establishment in
   Japan where, in a three-week effort, they were installed {photo} ,
   calibrated, and brought into operation. A subsequent two-week trip for
   further tests and calibration has resulted in the world's fastest
   triton burnup detectors routinely providing data along two radial
   channels. [discrim.gif]

   Pulse height discrimination is used to separate out the response due to
   14 MeV neutrons, and the smaller pulses due to 2.5 MeV neutrons and
   gammas. Shown above is a comparison of four discriminator threshholds
   (50mV, 125mV, 250mV and 300mV), where the progression from a DD-like
   response, to a mixed response, to a pure DT response is observed on
   JT-60U, as the threshhold is raised. Typical examples of this data were
   shown at the APS meeting in Nov. 1994, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.


   Presently there are six sight lines of Sci-Fi detectors on the JT-60U
   experiment. We are improving the pulse-height uniformity by adding a
   diffuser plate between the PMT and scintillators.
