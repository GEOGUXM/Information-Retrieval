   Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (P.L.
   101-646)
     __________________________________________________________________

     * Prevention of Unintentional Introductions of Aquatic Nuisance
       Species;
     * Prevention and Control of Aquatic Nuisance Species
     * Zebra Mussel Demonstration Program
     * State Aquatic Nuisance Species Management Plans
     __________________________________________________________________

   To prevent and control infestations of the coastal inland waters of the
   United States by the zebra mussel and other nonindigenous aquatic
   nuisance species, to reauthorize the National Sea Grant College
   Program, and fo r other purposes.

   The purposes of the Act are -
   (1) to prevent unintentional introduction and dispersal of
   nonindigenous species* into waters of the United States through ballast
   water management and other requirements;
   (2) to coordinate federally conducted, funded or authorized research,
   prevention control, information dissemination and other activities
   regarding the zebra mussel and other aquatic nuisance species**;
   (3) to develop and carry out environmentally sound control methods to
   prevent, monitor and control unintentional introductions of
   nonindigenous species from pathways other than ballast water exchange;
   (4) to understand and minimize economic and ecological impacts of
   nonindigenous aquatic nuisance species that become established,
   including the zebra mussel; and
   (5) to establish a program of research and technology development and
   assistance to states in the management and removal of zebra mussels.

   *Nonindigenous species means any species or other viable biological
   material that enters an ecosystem beyond its historic range, including
   any such organisms transferred from one country into another.

   **Aquatic nuisance species means a nonindigenous species that threatens
   the diversity or abundance of native species or the ecological
   stability of infested waters, or commercial, agricultural, aquacultural
   or recreational activities dependent on such waters.

   The act calls for the -

  Prevention of Unintentional Introductions of Aquatic Nuisance Species;

   A National Ballast Water Control Program part of which will consist of
   a ballast exchange study. The study will assess the environmental
   effects of ballast water exchange on the diversity and abundance of
   native species in receiving estuarine, marine , and fresh waters of the
   United States and identify areas within the waters of the United States
   and the exclusive economic zone, if any, where the exchange of ballast
   water does not pose a threat of infestation or spread of aquatic
   nuisance species in t he Great Lakes and other waters.

  Prevention and Control of Aquatic Nuisance Species

   A Task Force is established that shall develop and implement a program
   for the waters of the United States to prevent introductions and
   dispersal of aquatic nuisance species; to monitor, control, and study
   such species; and to disseminate related inf ormation. Research is to
   be conducted concerning -

                (a) the environmental and economic risks associated with
                the introduction of aquatic nuisance species into waters
                of the United States;
                (b) the principal pathways by which aquatic nuisance
                species are introduced and dispersed;
                (c) possible methods for the prevention, monitoring and
                control of aquatic nuisance species; and
                (d) the assessment of the effectiveness of prevention,
                monitoring, and control methods.

  Zebra Mussel Demonstration Program

   The Task Force shall undertake a program of prevention, monitoring,
   control, education, and research for the zebra mussel to be implemented
   in the Great Lakes and any other waters of the United States infested
   or likely to become infested by the zebr a mussel, including -

          (a) research and development concerning the species life
          history, environmental tolerances and impacts on fisheries and
          other ecosystem components, and the efficacy of control
          mechanisms and means of avoiding or minimizing impacts;
          (b) tracking dispersal of the species and establishment of an
          early warning system to alert likely areas of future
          infestations;
          (c) development of control plans in coordination with regional,
          state, and local entities; and
          (d) provision of technical assistance to regional, state, and
          local entities.

  State Aquatic Nuisance Species Management Plans

   The Governor of each State may, after notice and opportunity for public
   comment, prepare and submit -

                (a) a comprehensive management plan to the Task Force for
                approval which identifies those areas or activities within
                that State, other than those related to public facilities,
                for which technical and financial assistance is needed to
                eliminate or re duce the environmental, public health, and
                safety risks associated with aquatic nuisance species,
                particularly the zebra mussel; and
                (b) a public facility management plan to the Assistant
                Secretary for approval which is limited solely to
                identifying those public facilities within the State for
                which technical and financial assistance is needed to
                reduce infestations of zebra muss els.
