                              General Overview

   Growing from its World War II experience, the [NESA00a.jpg] Civil Air
   Patrol has continued to strive to save lives and alleviate human
   suffering through a myriad of emergency service and operational
   missions.

   Search and Rescue (SAR): Perhaps best known for its search and rescue
   efforts, CAP now flies more than 85 percent of all federal inland SAR
   missions directed by the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center at
   Langley AFB, Virginia. Outside of the continental United States, CAP
   supports the Joint Rescue Coordination Centers in Alaska, Hawaii and
   Puerto Rico. Just how effective are the CAP missions? More than 100
   people are saved every year by CAP members!

   Disaster Relief: Often overlooked but vitally important is the role CAP
   plays in disaster relief operations. CAP provides air and ground
   transportation, and an extensive communications network. They fly
   disaster relief officials to remote locations, and support local, state
   and national disaster relief organizations with manpower, leadership
   and other valuable and needed resources.

   In fact, CAP has formal agreements with many government and
   humanitarian relief agencies such as the American Red Cross, Federal
   Emergency Management Agency, Federal Aviation Administration, National
   Transportation Safety Board and the United States Coast Guard.

   Humanitarian Services: Closely related to disaster relief is CAP's
   support of humanitarian missions. Usually in support of the Red Cross,
   CAP air crews transport time-sensitive medical materials including
   blood and human tissue in situations where other means of
   transportation are not possible.

   [WTCS01a.jpg] Air Force Support: It's hardly surprising that CAP
   performs several missions in direct support of the U.S. Air Force.
   Specifically, CAP conducts damage assessment, radiological monitoring,
   light transport, communications support, and low-altitude route
   surveys.

   Joint U.S. Air Force and CAP exercises sharpen the skills of all
   participants and offer realistic training for  serious missions like
   the video support we provided at the World Trade Center.
            _____________________________________________________

   Counterdrugs: CAP joined the "war on drugs" in 1986 when CAP signed an
   agreement with the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Customs Service offering CAP
   resources to be used to stem the flow of drugs into and within the
   United States. Today, CAP has similar agreements with the Drug
   Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Forest Service.

   CAP has made major contributions to the counterdrug fight by providing
   aerial reconnaissance, airborne communication support, and airlift of
   law enforcement personnel. In 2000 alone, CAP assisted in the
   confiscation or eradication of billions of dollars in illegal drugs.
            _____________________________________________________

   CAP/ROTC Initiative: Starting in 1993, CAP became more closely involved
   in direct support of the Air Force ROTC. Joint efforts are underway to
   conduct cross flow educational and orientation flights with Air Force
   ROTC, benefiting both organizations through better use of each one's
   training resources.
