   Federal Fish Advisories

      In January 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) issued national advice to women who are
      pregnant or may become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children
      regarding consumption of fish that may contain mercury. Fish can be an
      important source of nutrition; however, some fish contain harmful
      levels of the pollutant mercury which can harm the developing brain and
      nervous system. You can avoid the risks associated with mercury and
      still get the health benefits of eating fish by following the National
      Advisories issued by EPA and FDA:

      EPA Advice for Fish Caught in Local Freshwaters
      EPA has issued national advice to women who are pregnant or may become
      pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children on the number of meals of
      fish caught in local freshwaters that are safe to eat each week. For
      specific information, please read EPA's National Advisory

      FDA Advice for Commercial Fish Bought in Stores and Restaurants
      The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued advice to women who
      are pregnant or may become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young
      children on eating commercial fish bought in stores and restaurants.
      The advisory states that shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish
      pose the greatest risk and should not be consumed by pregnant women,
      children, or nursing mothers. For specific information, please read
      FDA's National Advisory fact sheet [exitepa.gif]
