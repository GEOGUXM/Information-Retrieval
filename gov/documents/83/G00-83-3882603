   323-3176 October 4, 2001 MEMORANDUM FOR: Local Redevelopment Agency
   Officials FROM: SUBJECT: Reporting Forms (Schedules HCD-A, B, C, D1-D7
   and E) Attached are the reporting forms to fulfill the annual reporting
   requirement for housing activities and the status and use of the Low
   and Moderate Income Housing Fund for Fiscal Year 2000-2001. State law
   requires RDAs to report within six months of the fiscal year end.
   Instructions for filling out the reporting forms and copies of the
   forms are available to download from our website
   (http://www.hcd.ca.gov). We can email you the forms (as document
   files), if you submit an email request to either: gcampora@hcd.ca.gov
   or tcromart@hcd.ca.gov. As an alternative to manually completing HCD's
   schedules, we highly recommend agencies access our website to
   electronically report data using HCD's On-Line System. The main
   advantage is that agencies can self-report, print, review, and correct
   "summary data" before HCD publishes its annual report on Redevelopment
   Housing Activities. All redevelopment agencies, regardless of status
   (new, inactive, etc.) or choice of reporting methodology (electronic or
   manual), must complete the HCD cover sheet. Return the cover sheet
   (and, if applicable, completed schedules) to the State Controller no
   later than December 31, 2001 (if the agency's fiscal year ended June
   30). To fulfill the agency's reporting requirement, please follow the
   guidelines listed below: 1. Cover sheet. Report general information and
   identify the schedules required to be completed. 2. Please answer each
   line item or write in "not applicable" ("N/A") or "none" where a line
   item does not apply or there was no activity. 3. Report dates
   numerically (e.g., report September 1, 2000 as 9/1/2000.) 4. Round
   amounts to the nearest dollar and ensure that financial information is
   consistent with that reported to the State Controller. Pursuant to
   various Health and Safety Code sections (Section 33080, et.al.), HCD's
   forms collect data that the Department is required to report to the
   Legislature. The code sections can be downloaded from the Internet
   (www.leginfo.ca.gov/). Please note the opportunity for special
   recognition of an innovative or outstanding housing project or program
   resulting in affordable units completed during FY 00/01 (see item 20 of
   Schedule HCD-C). HCD would light to highlight in its report a variety
   of agencies' successful housing programs and projects. Agencies can
   also nominate exemplary projects or programs for the Director's Housing
   Excellence Award. If you have any questions in completing this report,
   please contact Glen Campora at (916) 327-2640. Attachments HCD ANNUAL

   Jurisdiction: California Redevelopment law (Health and Safety Code
   Section 33080.1) requires agencies to annually report their housing

   Development (HCD) to compile and annually publish a report on
   redevelopment agencies' housing activities in accordance with Section
   33080.6. (Note: Pursuant to Section 33080.3, submit this form and, if
   applicable, all completed HCD Schedules, to the State Controller.)

   Section 33334.12(g)(1), report on Excess Surplus that is required to be
   determined on the first day of a fiscal year. Excess Surplus exists
   when the Adjusted Balance exceeds the greater of: (1) $1,000,000 or (2)
   the aggregate amount of tax increment deposited to the Housing Fund
   during the four prior fiscal years. Section 33334.12(g)(3)(A) and (B)
   provide that the Unencumbered Balance can be adjusted for: (1) any
   remaining revenue generated in the reporting year from unspent debt
   proceeds and (2) if the land was disposed of during the reporting year
   to develop affordable housing, the difference between the fair market
   value of land and the value received. The Unencumbered Balance is
   calculated by subtracting encumbrances from Net Resources Available.
   "Encumbrances" are funds reserved and committed pursuant to a legally
   enforceable contract or agreement for expenditure for authorized
   redevelopment housing activities [Section 33334.12(g)(2)]. For Excess
   Surplus calculation purposes, carry over the prior year's HCD Schedule
   C Adjusted Balance as the Adjusted Balance on the first day of the
   reporting fiscal year. Determine which is larger: (1) $1 million or (2)
   the total of tax increment deposited over the prior four years.
   Subtract the largest amount from the Adjusted Balance and, if positive,
   report the amount as Excess Surplus. 10. Excess Surplus: Fill in the

   Director's Award for Housing Excellence Project achievement information
   is optional but can serve important purposes: Agencies' achievements
   can inform others of successful redevelopment projects and provide
   instructive information for additional successful projects.

   Activities of California Redevelopment Agencies to assist other local
   agencies in developing effective and efficient programs to address
   local housing needs. In addition, HCD selects various projects to
   receive the Director's Award for Housing Excellence. Projects are
   selected based on criteria such as local affordable housing need(s)
   met, resources utilized, barriers overcome, and project
   innovation/complexity, etc. Project achievement information should only
   be submitted for one affordable residential project that was completed
   within the reporting year as evidenced by a Certificate of Occupancy.
   The project must not have been previously reported as an achievement.
   To publish agencies' achievements in a standard format, please complete
   information for each underlined category below addressing suggested
   topics in a narrative format that does not exceed two pages (see
   example, next page). In addition to submitting information with other
