moon Clinical and Genetic Epidemiology Research

   BRCA Research Testing Agreement The Clinical and Genetic Epidemiology
   Research Branch (CGERB) directs and supports clinical and epidemiologic
   research on the role of genetic factors and their interactions that
   influence susceptibility or the resistance of individuals and
   populations to cancer and related health outcomes.

   Areas of stewardship include epidemiologic research on:
     * genetics,
     * gene-gene and gene-modifier interactions,
     * characterization of cancer susceptibility genes,
     * clinical and genetic networks and family registries,
     * clinical population genetics,
     * determinants of progression and prognosis,
     * precancerous conditions,
     * clinical diagnostic strategies, and
     * clinical bioethics.

   The branch also supports three programs to provide needed
   infrastructures to facilitate research:
     * Breast and Ovarian Cancer Family Registries (CFRs)
     * Colon Cancer Family Registries (CFRs)
     * Cancer Genetics Network (CGN)
