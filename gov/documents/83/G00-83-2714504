   Fermilab Experiment 866 is a fixed target experiment that has measured
   the asymmetry of down and up anti-quarks in the nucleon sea using
   Drell-Yan di-muons produced in 800 GeV proton interactions with
   hydrogen and deuterium targets. It has also made measurements of the
   suppression of the production of J/Psi's in nuclei over a broad range
   in xF and pT as well as angular distributions for J/Psi production.

   A short popular description of the dbar/ubar asymmetry measurement.
