   [Squiggle.gif] Domain Registration - Wednesday, December 12, 2001
   Many of you have diligently registered your internet domain names in
   the accepted format for government entities. That isyou have used the
   domain registration syntax for counties that is:
   "www.co.countyname.wa.us". Others have registered with an independent
   ISP, using a .ORG, .NET, or other domain call. There is nothing wrong
   with that.

   HOWEVER, be warned, that SHOULD you decide to register using the domain
   convention for counties, (which, by the way is the same for all 3066
   counties across the US) you must make certain that you retain the
   rights to your old domain, and then redirect to your new web addressthe
   consequences of not doing this are that some other web entity can
   co-opt your old domain name using it for something entirely unpleasant
   and unsavory.

   For more information contact me, CRAB Webmaster, and I'll share what
   information I have.
