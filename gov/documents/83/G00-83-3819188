   The mission of the AET program is to use LLNL capabilities in the R&D
   of energy technologies to enhance national security, minimize
   environmental impact, and increase U.S. competitiveness and industrial
   productivity.

   The AET program has four business units: Fossil and Geothermal
   Technologies, Energy Conversion and Storage Technologies,
   Transportation, and Energy Infrastructure. These overlapping
   technologies cohesively integrate to enhance the programs effectiveness
   in meeting its energy mission.

   To ensure that these cutting-edge technologies are brought to market,
   AET actively develops collaborative partnerships with industry.
