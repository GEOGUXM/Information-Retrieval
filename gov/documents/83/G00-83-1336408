                            PO.DAAC FTP Site Utilities

      The JPL PO.DAAC FTP Site uses the Washington University FTP server
      which can be obtained from http://www.wu-ftpd.org. This server supports
      a number of features including TAR and Compressed data transfers.

   TAR Data Transfer

      If your system supports the TAR utility, you can request an entire
      directory from our FTP site by typing:
   get directory.tar

      A tar file of the requested directory will be created and sent to your
      computer.

   Compressed Data Transfer

      If your system supports either GNU ZIP (GZIP) or UNIX COMPRESS, you can
      request a compressed version of any data file by appending the
      appropriate suffix.

      To obtain GZIP compressed files, type:
   get filename.gz

      To obtain UNIX compressed files, type:
   get filename.Z

   TAR Compress Data Transfer

      The Compression utilities can be used in conjunction with the Tar
      utility. For example, the command:
   get directory.tar.Z

      creates and sends a compressed tar file of the selected directory.

                            Anonymous FTP Instructions

      To access the PO.DAAC FTP site, enter the following on a computer which
      is connected to the internet:
        ftp podaac.jpl.nasa.gov

      or
        ftp 128.149.225.30

      To login, enter "anonymous" at the name prompt, and use your complete
      e-mail address as your password. All available data are located in the
      pub directory. To change directories, enter:
        cd pub
        ls

      The latter command will list all files and subdirectories. The
      subdirectories in the pub directory are named according to
      oceanographic parameter. Therefore, to access sea surface temperature
      data, for example, enter:
        cd pub/sea_surface_temperature

      Once you have located the files which you would like to transfer,
      enter:
        get filename

      to obtain a single file. Similarly, multiple files can be obtained
      using the "mget" command.
        mget *common*

      where *common* are all files with "common" in their filenames.

      Please remember that most PO.DAAC data files are in binary, and thus,
      must be transferred in binary. To do so, enter:
        binary

      before "getting" any files.

      Once you have completed data transfer, enter:
        quit

   to end your FTP session.
