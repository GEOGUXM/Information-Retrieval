   What are the responsibilities of the Commission?

   The Commission is charged with:
   Regulating all filling and dredging in San Francisco Bay (which
       includes San Pablo and Suisun Bays, sloughs and certain creeks and
       tributaries that are part of the Bay system, salt ponds and certain
       other areas that have been diked-off from the Bay).
       Protecting the Suisun Marsh, the largest remaining wetland in
       California, by administering the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act in
       cooperation with local governments.
       Regulating new development within the first 100 feet inland from
       the Bay to ensure that maximum feasible public access to the Bay is
       provided.
       Minimizing pressures to fill the Bay by ensuring that the limited
       amount of shoreline area suitable for high priority water-oriented
       uses is reserved for ports, water-related industries,
       water-oriented recreation, airports and wildlife areas.
       Pursuing an active planning program to study Bay issues so that
       Commission plans and policies are based upon the best available
       current information.
       Administering the federal Coastal Zone Management Act within the
       San Francisco Bay segment of the California coastal zone to ensure
       that federal activities reflect Commission policies.
       Participating in the region wide State and federal program to
       prepare a Long Term Management Strategy (LTMS) for dredging and
       dredge material disposal in San Francisco Bay.
       Participating in California's oil spill prevention and response
       planning program.

   A BCDC permit must be obtained before you do any of the following
   things within the Commission's jurisdiction:
   Place solid material, build or repair docks, pile-supported or
       cantilevered structures, dispose of material or moor a vessel for a
       long period in San Francisco Bay or in certain tributaries that

   How do I apply for a BCDC Permit?

   To get a BCDC permit, you need to complete an application form (which
   requires detailed project information and plans) and pay a processing
   fee that ranges from $50 for a pre-authorized project to $10,000 for a
   project costing more than ten million dollars. The application must be
   submitted by the owner of the project site or the owner's
   representative (architect, attorney, contractor, etc.).

   How long does it take to process my application?

   Once you submit a complete application, by law the Commission must
   grant or deny your permit within 90 days unless you agree to extend
   this period. Most applications are processed within five to eight
   weeks.

   How do I get an application?

   Application forms and instructions, information describing the
   Commission's permit review process and other documents that may be
   helpful to you are available on-line. If you desire, the same documents
   will be sent to you upon request at no charge.

   This material can also be picked up at the Commission's office. During
   office hours, a staff member is always available to answer questions.

   Do I need other permits?

   BCDC cannot file your application as complete until you have received
   all discretionary local permits (i.e., variances, zoning changes,
   excavation or fill permits, planned unit development and tentative
   subdivision map approvals and all other local approvals except
   ministerial permits, such as building permits). However, do not wait
   until you have your local permits to contact BCDC. By discussing your
   project with the Commission's staff before you have completed your
   plans, you can avoid having to go through the local review process a
   second time to gain approval for design changes that are needed to meet
   BCDC requirements.

   BCDC encourages applicants to file draft applications to make it easier
   for the staff to assist you. In addition, projects that require BCDC
   permits often must receive authorization from the California Regional
   Water Quality Control Board--San Francisco Bay Region, and the U.S.
   Army Corps of Engineers.

   What happens if I begin work without a permit?

   BCDC operates an active enforcement program to detect and prosecute
   violators who do not get required BCDC permits or do not carry out
   permitted activities properly. The owner of the property on which a
   violation takes place is legally responsible for the violation.
   Unintentional, technical violations can be handled with after-the-fact
   permits (at double the normal processing fee) if the unpermitted work
   otherwise complies with state law.

   The Commission handles other violations by issuing cease and desist
   orders, which can require that work be stopped, unpermitted structures
   be removed, and other remedies.

   In addition, the Commission can impose civil penalties of $10 to $1,000
   a day (to a maximum of $20,000 for each violation). Serious violations
   are referred to the California Attorney General for prosecution. Under
   state law, these violations are subject to civil penalties of up to
   $5,000 a day or more.
