   Please fill out this form to register each off-site node that needs to
   obtain products from the Fermilab Product Distribution (upd.fnal.gov or
   ftp.fnal.gov) platform. Once you are registered, a confirmation message
   will be sent. If you do not receive confirmation, then you have not
   been registered! Contact helpdesk@fnal.gov for more information.

   The Fermilab Product Distribution Platform is the ftp/upd server for
   software packages that Fermilab makes available to our employees,
   visitors, and collaborators. In general, these are utilities that are
   written (and available) elsewhere, which have been repackaged for use
   in the Fermi User Environment (FUE). You must be on a registered node
   in order to obtain these products, and you must be affiliated with
   Fermilab in order for your registration to be approved. (NOTE: all
   machines in the fnal.gov domain are automatically registered; you only
   need to fill out this form if you are registering an off-site node).

   Most of the locally-developed software packages that we support (and
   which are generally not available elsewhere) are also available through
   the public Fermitools program. You do not need to register in order to
   obtain these software tools.

   The Computing Division supports two methods of obtaining products from
   the distribution server. The first method (which is the only supported
   method for obtaining Fermitools products) is via anonymous ftp to
   ftp.fnal.gov. The publicly-available products are under the /pub
   directory; the other packages are found under the /products directory.
   Most products are distributed in three separate pieces: the product
   tarfile, the product ups directory tarfile, and the product table file.
   For a description of how to obtain and unwind these three pieces, see
   http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/ups/FTPinstructions/.

   For registered machines, the preferred method of obtaining Fermilab
   products is via upd (the UPS Product Distribution utility). UPD
   automates the steps needed to copy, unwind and install UPS products on
   your local system. Familiarization with ups and upd is essential;
   therefore we recommend that you read the documentation available at
   http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/ups/ including "UPS and UPD v4
   Reference Manual".
