   MSHA's Data Retrieval System


   MSHA's Data Retrieval System

   The Data Retrieval System was last updated 06:30 am EST - 01/26/2002.
        MSHA's Data Retrieval System (DRS) permits miners, operators and
   other interested parties to retrieve mine overviews, accident
   histories, violation histories, inspector dust samplings, and operator
   dust samplings. This system is a work in progress. As additional data
   becomes available new features will be added. Be sure to check back
   regularly to take advantage of the new features.
        Please enter a valid MSHA Mine ID No. or Contractor ID No., if you
   know it, or enter a search string with which to search for companies
   operating mines or for contractors.
        Please note that the information provided by the Data Retrieval
   System is based on data gathered from various MSHA systems. As there
   may be a lag time in data being entered into those systems, there will
   also be a lag in the reflection of that data on the DRS.
