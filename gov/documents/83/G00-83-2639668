GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE OMSK REGION


   January 2002

   Prepared by Azim Mamanov, BISNIS Representative in Novosibirsk


   SUMMARY


   In 1716, Colonel Ivan Buchgoltz founded the Omsk fortress at the
   junction of the Irtysh and Om Rivers. Years later, as the fortress was
   further developing and growing, it became the city of Omsk. By the
   beginning of 19th century, Omsk became an important center of trade and
   agricultural science. The basis of industrial potential was founded
   during the World War II, as dozens of enterprises were evacuated from
   European part of Russia to Siberian cities, and Omsk in particular.
   Active development of the defense industry proceeded in the post-war
   time. Today, Omsk provides investment opportunities for U.S. companies
   in various industries most developed in the region, including
   oil-refining, chemical, agricultural, and high-tech production
   industries.


   GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND POPULATION


   Omsk is geographically located in the middle of the vast continent on
   the south of West Siberia. It borders with the Tyumen region on the
   west and north, Novosibirsk and Tomsk regions on the east, and the
   Republic of Kazakhstan on the south. The territory of the Omsk region
   stretches for 600 kilometers from north to south, and for 300
   kilometers from east to west, and occupies an area of 140 sq.
   kilometers. The average temperature in winter is about –19 Centigrade,
   and +18 Centigrade in summer.


   The region’s population is 2,176,000 people, including 1,170,000
   inhabiting the city of Omsk, the administrative center of the region.
   The distance from Omsk to Moscow is roughly 2,550 kilometers.


   NATURAL RESOURCES


   The region has relatively scarce natural resources. Oil resources are
   estimated at 150 million tons. Over 280 deposits of peat are found in
   the region. Up to 30 deposits, with total reserves of 36.5 million tons
   of peat, are prepared for industrial development.


   Significant reserves of zirconium-ilmenite ore sands near the town of
   Tara were discovered. The reserves exceed 160 million cubic meters.
   Zirconium and Titanium are used in various industries, such as ferrous
   and non-ferrous metallurgy, equipment production, and chemical
   industry.


   Forest resources of the region cover an area of 2,574,300 hectares,
   including 963,400 hectares of coniferous, and 1,608,100 hectares of
   deciduous wood. Total reserves of commercial wood are estimated at 6.3
   million cubic meters, including 800 million cubic meters of coniferous,
   and 5.5 million cubic meters of deciduous timber.


   INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION


   Overall regional industrial production in 2000 totaled 25.7 billion
   rubles (US$908 million), which is 11 percent more than 1999. The region
   ranks 19^th among Russian regions in industrial production, while the
   city of Omsk ranks 4^th among industrially developed cities of Russia,
   after Moscow, St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg.

   One of the leading industries in the region is fuel production. The
   industry consists of mainly oil processing, and natural and condensate
   gas extraction sectors. The main products of the oil processing sector
   are gasoline, diesel fuel, and fuel oil. The production of gasoline in
   2000 totaled over 2.9 million tons, diesel fuel – over 4.2 million
   tons, and oil fuel – over 1.9 million tons. The products are mostly
   exported to surrounding Siberian regions, and foreign countries other
   than NIS:

   A major enterprise involved in the energy industry is the Oil Refining
   Plant, one of the leading in gasoline and diesel fuel production in
   Russia. Its operation began in 1955, and spurred development of the
   petrochemical industry in the region. Leading enterprises in the
   petrochemical industry are OmskShina JSC (tire production),
   OmskTechUglerod JSC, and Omsky Kuchuk JSC (production of rubber and
   latex).


   Mechanical engineering contributes over 17 percent in gross regional
   production. The majority of the enterprises in the industry are
   involved in the defense sector. The largest enterprises are Polet,
   Transportation Machines Plant, SibCrioTekhnika, and Siberian Devices
   and Systems. As a result of conversion programs development, these
   enterprises gradually began to manufacture non-military-purpose
   machinery and equipment, such as civil aircrafts, tractors, medical
   equipment, and motor engines.


   AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY


   The agricultural complex of the Omsk region is considered to be one of
   the most developed in Russia. The area of agricultural lands
   constitutes 6.6 million hectares, including 4.3

   million hectares of plough-land, 1.2 million hectares of pasture land
   and over 1.0 million hectares of hayfields. About 56 percent of the
   sowing acreage is for grain crops, mostly wheat. Oil-bearing crops,
   flax, and sunflower are cultivated as well. The production of grain in
   2000 was over 1.7 million tons:
