   Technical Support Program

      The Technical Support Program (TSP) was established in April of 1992.
      TSP staff help residential care providers achieve and maintain
      compliance with licensing regulations. They also work to improve
      communication between care providers and the licensing agency. TSP
      staff offer consultation in individual facilities and provide group
      training sessions for care providers with common training needs. TSP
      services are provided free of charge and on a voluntary basis.

      The TSP emphasizes prevention through education. Care providers develop
      procedures that will prevent compliance problems. A major focus of each
      consultation is to provide licensees and facility staff with
      information needed to operate their facilities in compliance with
      licensing requirements.

      The TSP maintains a resource library with a variety of information on
      how to improve  services. It also has handouts to assist care providers
      to assess clients' needs, clarify regulatory requirements, and enable
      licensees and staff to evaluate their facility operation.

      Topics for which TSP provides training are listed below. To arrange for
      a facility consultation, a group training session, or to request items
      from the resource library, you may contact TSP at (916) 229-4512 or
      click on the link for a complete phone roster.
