   Why Use FAFSA on the Web?



     There are several good reasons why you should consider using FAFSA on
     the Web:
       * FAFSA on the Web is faster than applying for aid by paper.
       * FAFSA on the Web uses skip logic based on your particular
         information, so you will need to answer fewer questions than on the
         paper application.
       * FAFSA on the Web checks your answers before you submit your
         application, so there is less chance your application will be
         rejected because of missing or conflicting information.
       * You can save application information so that it can be completed
         and transmitted at a later time.
       * FAFSA on the Web can be used on Windows or Macintosh computers,
         using the most popular Netscape and Microsoft browser versions.
       * FAFSA on the Web doesn't require software to be installed, so it
         takes less time before you can actually use the application.
       * You can access the FAFSA on the Web page from anywhere, including
         school or home, making it more convenient to complete the
         application.
       * FAFSA on the Web can support an unlimited number of users, allowing
         thousands of students to apply at once.
