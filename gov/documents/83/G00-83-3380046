   Global Ionospheric Specifications Using the Global GPS Network

   A capability of monitoring the global distribution of ionospheric total
   electron content (TEC) has been developed at JPL using dual-frequency
   observations from a worldwide network of Global Positioning System
   (GPS). Using the GPS data Combined with the Kalman filter technique and
   an ionospheric model, global ionosphere maps (GIM) of vertical TEC can
   be produced with an hourly or sub-hourly resolution.

   Validation of GIM and Calibration for Single-Frequency Altimetry
   Missions

   GIM
   The accuracy of the GIM solutions can be assessed by direct comparisons
   with independent vertical TEC measurements, such as those retrieved
   from the dual-frequency altimetry data taken by the TOPEX satellite. On
   the other hand, single-frequency satellite altimetry missions will
   benefit from using GIM solutions to provide global ionospheric
   corrections.
