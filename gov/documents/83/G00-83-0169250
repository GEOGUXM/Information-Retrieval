  The Argus World Wide Web Project
     __________________________________________________________________

    Introduction

   During the past several years, the Internet has undergone explosive
   growth. Millions of users world-wide have become aware of its colossal
   potential and are now taking advantage of its many innovative services.
   Among the Internet's diverse resources, one in particular has emerged
   as a very powerful and popular method for distributing and sharing
   information. Known as the World-Wide Web (WWW), this unique information
   service has become synonymous with the "Information Superhighway" and
   is an important element of the National Information Infrastructure
   (NII) strategy.

   The WWW is an vast collection of information servers that are
   interconnected via the Internet. These servers provide an enormous
   variety of information that may be examined using any of several
   "viewers" or information "navigators" that are available via the public
   domain or commercial sector. The information acessible on each these
   servers can take on a variety of graphical forms including text,
   photographic images, audio segments, and even real-time video.
   Information obtained from one server may often make reference to other
   servers, providing users with alternative paths for gathering relevant
   information on a particular topic. As a result, a large network or
   "Web" of information is readily accessible in an easy to use fashion.
   With the naming of the Argus Security System as the standard security
   system for the Department of Energy (DOE), there is a growing need
   among both current and potential users to have more direct access to
   Argus's many information and documentation resources. The versatility
   of the WWW provides an ideal platform for meeting this need. The DOE is
   similarly make good use of this technology with their own home page. As
   a result, the Argus WWW Project was initiated at Lawrence Livermore
   National Laboratory (LLNL) to demonstrate the feasibility of this
   concept. The prototype information server described below was
   successfully constructed and is now operational at LLNL. Although all
   information contained on this server is obviously unclassified and in
   conformance with strict LLNL publishing guidelines, access to the
   server is nevertheless restricted to only those individuals within
   United States Government organizations that have a legitimate interest.
   Several added information privacy enhancements are also underway to
   ensure long-term protection prior to going fully operational on the
   Internet.

    Argus Web Sever Information Services

   Argus is a very comprehensive security system that was specifically
   engineered for high-security facilities. As an extremely reliable and
   robust system, a wealth of knowledge pertaining to the installation,
   activation, maintenance, and operation of Argus has been compiled and
   is continually being updated. The type of information that a user may
   frequently need to access includes software product release notes,
   installation documents, and technical instructions in addition to
   system overview information and functional specifications.

   Using the WWW, information is accessible via what is known as a "web
   page". A web page resembles a hypertext document. Within a particular
   page, various words, phrases, and images are often linked to other
   hypertext documents or pages. The user views these other pages by
   selecting the hypertext item (i.e., a hyperlink) and the new page is
   retrieved and subsequently displayed. A single Web server may contain
   one or more pages linked in this fashion. The main or highest level
   page available on a server is often referred to as the "Home Page" for
   that information resource. Hyperlinks within a page can (and frequently
   do) reference pages on other information servers located elsewhere on
   the Internet.

   Via the Internet, the Argus home page can be accessed by specifying a
   WWW address known as Uniform Resource Locator (URL). URLs are rapidly
   becoming commonplace, appearing in the news media often as frequently
   as telephone numbers. The URL for the Argus Home Page is
   http://argus.llnl.gov. A copy of the Argus home page is attached with
   the hard copy version of this report. The Argus home page contains
   several "hyperlinks" to other information resources pertaining to Argus
   and related development efforts at LLNL. Included in the Argus home
   page are information links about the Argus Security System, the
   Complex-Wide Access Control (CWAC) project, the DOE Integrated
   Safeguards and Security (DISS) Project, the Aegis Initiative, and
   several other security projects currently underway at LLNL.
