   Dear Taxpayer:

   [tab.jpg] The economic slowdown that began in the third quarter of 2000
   was already well underway on September 11. Since then, job losses and a
   further decline in revenues in key sectors of our economy have
   occasioned higher federal social spending, while dampening federal tax
   collections.

   [tab.jpg] Nonetheless, fiscal 2001 resulted in the second-highest
   federal tax surplus in history, and the fourth consecutive year of
   surpluses in the federal Treasury. These surpluses have been used to
   pay down over one-half trillion dollars in federal debt.

   [tab.jpg] Today, putting Americans back to work is of vital importance
   to winning the War on Terrorism. That is why President Bush has called
   on Congress to pass an Economic Security bill to reduce tax burdens on
   job creation.

   [tab.jpg] The sensitivity of the federal budget to the overall health
   of the economy is just one of the important facts that can be gleaned
   from this year's Annual Report. Each year since 1989, I have provided
   this summary of the federal government's financial operations because,
   as a taxpayer, you are entitled to it. I hope you find it useful.


   Sincerely,
