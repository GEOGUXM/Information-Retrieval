   Developing E-Gov Professionals

   The Office of Electronic Government, in Partnership with the University
   of Maryland Robert H. Smith School of Business, has launched a program
   to promote development and training of electronic government
   professionals.
   Each semester, a team of student consultants from the Smith's Center
   for Knowledge and Information Management study various aspects of
   Electronic Government and recommend a set of strategies on various
   aspects of electronic initiatives.
   Over the last year, a team of graduate students have interviewed key
   officials from Office of Management and Budget, Federal agencies and
   key Congressional staff and analyze private sector to recommend
   alternative funding to funding government startups, a method to measure
   the effectiveness of the Education Department's Free Application for
   Federal Student Aid, and a study e-Government Success
