                                     [wedge_sm.gif] Sidewalk Shoveling Law

              The Saint Paul City Charter Commission is now reviewing four
    redistricting plans for City Council Ward boundaries based on the 2000
                                          census. See if youre affected.

     Is your sidewalk shoveled? The law says it must be shoveled within 24
   hours. You may report an unshoveled sidewalk, and the City will require
     the property owner to clear the walk -- or do the work and charge the
                                                    property owner for it.
