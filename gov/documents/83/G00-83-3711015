Summary

   The Fisheries Statistics & Economics Division of the National Marine
   Fisheries Service (NMFS) has automated data summary programs that
   anyone can use to rapidly and easily summarize U.S. commercial
   fisheries landings.

   These programs allow you to query our commercial fishery data bases and
   summarize United States domestic commercial landings in several
   formats. Domestic fishery landings are those fish and shellfish that
   are landed and sold in the 50 states by U.S. fishermen and do not
   include landings made in U.S. territories or by foreign fishermen. You
   can summarize the pounds and dollar value of commercial landings by
   your choice of years, months, states and species for the years
   1990-2000. The volume and value of 1950-2000 landings can be summarized
   by: years, states and species; by years, states, species and fishing
   gears; or years, states, species, finfish or shellfish groups, and
   price per pound.

   Data Caveats

   Please read the caveats associated with these data before using them in
   any research, report or commercial endeavor. If you have questions
   about the data or are aware of any errors, write us at our e-mail
   address or call 301-713-2328.

   We will make other fishery landings, vessel, fishing gear and other
   information available to users as time permits.
