        Welcome to the Ceramics Division in the Materials Science and
   Engineering Laboratory. The mission of the Ceramics Division is to work
        with industry, standards bodies, universities, and government
   laboratories in providing the leadership for the Nation's measurements
    and standards infrastructure for ceramic materials. To this end, the
   Ceramics Division conducts programs pertinent to measurement issues for
       ceramic materials through fundamental and applied research, the
   development of standard test methodologies, the preparation of standard
    reference materials, and the evaluation and dissemination of standard
    reference data. This website is designed to help you learn more about
         these programs and we welcome your questions and comments.
