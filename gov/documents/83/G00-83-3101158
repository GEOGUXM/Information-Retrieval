HEASARC Software

   The following software is supported by the HEASARC. Most of this
   software is designed for professional researchers and advanced students
   for the analysis of scientific astronomical observations in FITS
   format. The 'fv' program is also suitable for more general use by
   amateurs and educators for viewing astronomical image files. These
   software packages are to be downloaded to the users machine. Web-based
   tools are available on our utilities page.
