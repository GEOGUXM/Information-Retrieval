                     The Office of the Mobilehome Ombudsman

   P.O. Box 31
   Sacramento, Ca 95812-0031
   1-800-952-5275

   The Office of the Mobilehome Ombudsman is a complaint processing Office
   that primarily assists the public with questions or problems associated
   with the various aspects of manufactured home (mobilehome) living. This
   includes complaints with manufactured home dealers, sales, and
   warranties. This Office also processes complaints associated with other
   programs under the purview of HCD's Division of Codes and Standards
   (Registration & Titling, Employee Housing, Manufactured Housing, and
   State Housing Law).

Typical Types of Complaints That Are Processed

  License Investigations Against Manufactured Home Manufacturers, Dealers, and
  Salespersons.

     * Advertising - False or misleading advertising.
     * Contract - Failure to provide contracted items.
     * Escrow - Usually applies to a failure to open escrow within 5
       working days of receipt of initial deposit.
     * Fraud/Misrepresentation - Deceit where there is a monetary loss.
     * Illegal Sale/Alteration - Selling non-complying or illegally
       altered manufactured homes.
     * Warranty - Construction faults with new manufactured homes (1 year
       warranty period).

  Mobilehome Park Inspections (includes Special Occupancy Parks, i.e.
  Recreational Vehicle Parks):

     * Imminent safety hazards that pose a danger to the health or safety
       of residents or property.
     * Sewage spills/leaks
     * Gas leaks
     * Electrical hazards
     * Fire Hazards
     * Lack of potable water
     * Illegal construction

  Mobilehome Residency Law Complaints:

   The Mobilehome Residency Law is found in the California Civil Code,
   Sections 798 through 799.99. The Office of the Mobilehome Ombudsman can
   assist and coordinate the resolution of Mobilehome Residency Law
   complaints, but does not have the authority or the jurisdiction to
   enforce the Mobilehome Residency Law. This Office does not arbitrate,
   mediate, negotiate, or provide legal advice on rental agreements,
   leases, or rent disputes. However, this Office does assist with
   questions and concerns regarding these sections of law as follows:
     * If a complainant requests Mobilehome Residency Law information,
       this Office can provide assistance over the telephone and mail a
       copy of the Mobilehome Residency Law, if requested.
     * When a completed complaint form is received containing Mobilehome
       Residency Law issues, a copy of the complaint is normally sent to
       the mobilehome park manager for resolution. This Office may
       facilitate a solution between parties, but it does not have the
       jurisdiction to order compliance to any section of the Mobilehome
       Residency Law. Obtaining legal advice is recommended.

   Please review the information describing the other Division of Codes
   and Standards Programs, to identify if this Office can assist you with
   concerns and complaints associated with the Registration & Titling,
   Employee Housing, Manufactured Housing, and State Housing Law Programs.
