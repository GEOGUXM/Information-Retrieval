   [ARM2000] In order to improve global climate simulations and
   predictions, the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation
   Measurements (ARM) program seeks to understand how clouds and other
   atmospheric constituents affect the transfer of radiant energy through
   the Earth's atmosphere. The ARM Cloud and Radiation Testbed (CART)
   sites which maintain a large concentration of ground-based instruments
   in continuous operation are a cornerstone for this work. These routine
   operations are often supplemented with intensive operating periods
   (IOPs) when additional instruments and scientists congregate to address
   specific questions. In March 2000, an IOP focused on studying the
   spatial distribution of cloudiness across the CART in northern
   Oklahoma. This IOP included observations with several visiting cloud
   radars, including the scanning NOAA/K radar, and several research
   aircraft. NOAA/K operated from the CART Central Facility and scanned
   cirrus and stratus clouds in RHI and PPI modes. In addition to the
   studies of distribution of cloudiness, the ETL work involves
   comparisons between NOAA/K and the CART site MMCR, which was designed
   by NOAA/ETL and implementing hardware upgrades to the MMCR.
