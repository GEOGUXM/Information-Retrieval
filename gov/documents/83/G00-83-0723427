   Your Vote Keeps Our Country Strong
   Vote America is the answer for every American who wants to give back to
   our country, show support and honor those who have given their lives
   for our freedom.
   The goal of the Vote America project is to provide every eligible voter
   with the opportunity to be a part of America and help protect democracy
   by strengthening it at its very core -- the ballot box.
   Vote America is a comprehensive civic participation program that
   includes voter outreach, voter education and voter turnout efforts. But
   it is also a volunteer program, encouraging Americans to "keep our
   country strong" by becoming a Vote America volunteer. You can serve as
   a poll worker, conduct a voter registration drive in your community,
   pledge to "take five" - register and recruit five voters to go the
   polls - and much, much more.
