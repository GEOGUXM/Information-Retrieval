                       The Booster Neutrino Experiment
     __________________________________________________________________


   The BooNE detector as seen by a computer simulation BooNE (Booster
   Neutrino Experiment) is a neutrino oscillation experiment to take place
   at Fermilab (Fermi National Accelerator Lab, FNAL) using neutrinos
   created from protons from the 8 GeV Booster. BooNE is motivated
   predominantly by the evidence for neutrino oscillations as claimed by
   the LSND experiment. The goals of BooNE are:
   1) confirm (or refute) the LSND observation with much better
   statistical precision (thousands of events compared to tens of events
   in LSND).
   2) accurately determine the oscillation parameters (sin²(2 theta),
   delta m²) of the oscillations.

   We have been approved by FNAL and are full-speed ahead with design,
   development, and obtaining funds.

   The name for the BooNE experiment was inspired by early American
   explorer and legend, Daniel Boone .
