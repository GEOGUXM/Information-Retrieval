   FESAC Panel on Burning Plasmas Charge 1.What scientific issues should
   be addressed by a burning plasma physics experiment and its major
   supporting elements? What are the different levels of self-heating that
   are needed to contribute to our understanding of these issues? 2.Which
   scientific issues are generic to toroidal magnetic confinement and
   which ones are concept-specific? What are the relative advantages of
   using various magnetic confinement concepts in studying burning plasma
   physics? As a part of your considerations, please address how the Next
   Step Options program should be used to assist the community in its
   preparations for an assessment in 2004,as recommended in the Priorities
   and Balance report. Members J. Freidberg (Chair), Herb Berk, Riccardo
