   ASTRONOMY TALK TO TRACE NASA'S MARS EXPLORATION STRATEGY

   Following the Water: The New Program for Mars Exploration including
   recent discoveries about the red planet and the roster of Mars missions
   being planned - will be the topic of a free, non-technical talk at 7
   p.m. PST on Wednesday, Jan. 23, at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills,
   Calif. The public is invited.

   Scott Hubbard, deputy director for research at NASA Ames Research
   Center, will deliver the lecture. Hubbard recently returned to Ames
   after serving as the first Mars program director at NASA Headquarters
   in Washington, D.C.

   "The Silicon Valley Astronomy Lecture Series is a valuable resource for
   the community, bringing the latest scientific research in astrobiology
   and astronomy to a wide audience," said NASA Ames Director Dr. Henry
   McDonald.

   At Ames, Hubbard is responsible for organizing, directing and
   implementing research efforts that further the strategic plans of the
   center. Prior to his assignment at NASA headquarters, Hubbard served as
   the Ames associate director for astrobiology and space programs,
   interim director of NASAs Astrobiology Institute (NAI) and manager of
   the agency's Lunar Prospector mission. He also is credited with
   creating NASAs Mars Pathfinder mission.

   Prior to coming to Ames in 1987, Hubbard was vice president and general
   manager of Canberra Semiconductor and a staff scientist at Lawrence
   Berkeley National Laboratory. Hubbard received a bachelors degree in
   physics and astronomy from Vanderbilt University and did graduate
   studies in semiconductor physics at the University of California,
   Berkeley.

   Hubbard has been awarded four NASA medals: twice the Outstanding
   Leadership Medal and twice the Exceptional Achievement Medal. He also
   has twice been awarded Laurels by Aviation Week magazine. Hubbard was
   elected to the International Academy of Astronautics, is an associate
   fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and is
   the author of more than 40 papers on space missions and related
   subjects.

    Additional information about NASA's Mars exploration strategy can be
