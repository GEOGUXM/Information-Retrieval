Overview of VA Cost Methods

     Because VA does not routinely prepare patient bills, VA researchers
     and analysts must rely on other sources to calculate the cost of
     health care encounters.  Three alternatives are available:
     micro-cost methods, average costing, and the Decision Support
     System.

     Micro-cost methods include three approaches, direct measurement,
     preparation of pseudo-bills, and estimation of a cost functions.

     Direct measurement.  Direct measurement is used to determine the
     cost of new interventions and programs unique to VA.  Inputs such as
     staff time and supply costs are directly measured to develop a
     precise cost estimate.  The time of each type of staff is estimated
     and its cost determined from accounting data.  The analyst may
     directly observe staff time, have staff keep diaries of their
     activities, or survey managers.  The cost of supplies, equipment,
     and other expenses must also be determined.  Program volume is
     determined from administrative records, and average cost estimated.
     When units of service are not homogenous, unit costs may be
     estimated by an accounting approach, by applying estimates of the
     relative cost of each service, or via an econometric approach.

     Pseudo bill.  The pseudo-bill method combines VA utilization data
     with unit costs from non-VA sources to estimate the cost of patient
     care. This is commonly referred to as the pseudo-bill method,
     because the itemized list of costs is analogous to a fee-for-service
     hospital bill.   The unit cost of each item may be estimated by
     using Medicare reimbursement rates, the charge rates of an
     affiliated university medical center, or some other non-VA sector
     source.

     Cost function.  The cost function method requires detailed cost and
     utilization data for a specific, non-VA service to simulate the cost
     of a comparable VA service.  If suitable non-VA data are available,
     a function can be estimated using cost-adjusted charges as the
     dependent variable and information about the encounter as the
     independent variable.  VA costs are simulated using VA utilization
     data and the functions parameters.  Its chief advantage is that it
     requires less data than is needed to prepare a pseudo-bill, making
     it a more economical way of micro-costing.

     Average cost methods.  This method combine relative values derived
     from non-VA cost datasets, VA utilization data, and department costs
     obtained from the VA Cost Distribution Report (CDR).  Every
     encounter with the same characteristics is assumed to cost the
     same.  Average cost estimates are needed because detailed
     micro-costing is too time-consuming and laborious a method to apply
     it to all possible health care utilization.  In many studies, and
     for some of the health care utilization in nearly every study, an
     average cost method can be used.

     Decision Support System.  Researchers are beginning to use the
     Decision Support System (DSS), a computerized cost-allocation system
     adopted by VA.  DSS staff are undertaking the difficult task of
     allocating costs to VA health care products and patients stays.   If
     DSS is found to be accurate, it will be an extremely useful source
     of VA cost information.  Validation is an important step in the use
     of DSS data.  Work with DSS to date suggest that analysts should not
     rely exclusively on DSS cost estimates.

     Which method is best?  The best method to use depends on the level
     of accuracy required.  Micro-costing methods are accurate, but
     expensive to employ.  Average cost methods are easier to undertake,
     but the cost estimate may not fully reflect how the intervention
     affects the resources used in providing care.  In fact, it is often
     appropriate to use mixed methodologies in the same study. Usually
     one uses a micro-cost method to estimate the cost of care associated
     with an intervention or the issue under study, and a simpler average
     cost method to find the cost of other unrelated care.

     The analyst must consider whether the assumptions used to create
     average cost estimates are appropriate to all utilization within the
     study; for example, whether the intervention might affect the cost
     of hospital stays in a way that will not be captured by the DRG or
     length of stay, or whether it will effect the cost of ambulatory
     visits in a way that will not be captured by the relative value
     units associated with CPT codes.

     Estimates of outpatient costs based on average cost methods do not
     reflect the cost of laboratory tests or prescriptions
     pharmaceuticals.  An analyst who needs an estimate that reflects
     this type of utilization must turn to micro-costing.  Orders for
     laboratory tests must be extracted from the VISTA system, and
     information on filled prescriptions must be obtained from VISTA or
     the Pharmacy Benefits Management system.
