   Method of delivery: Interactive television broadcast

   Duration: 3 hours

   Description:
   This course addresses explosive detection technologies with an emphasis
   on portal explosive detection technologies. Information discussed will
   include the following topical areas: difference between bulk and trace
   detection technologies; hand-held, bench-top and portal detection
   technologies and their applications; the key technologies used in
   explosive detection (IMS, X-ray and TNA); operational concepts for
   explosive detection technologies, different types of personnel portals,
   and different types of vehicle portals.

   Designed for:
   DOE and DOE-contractor physical security specialists and managers, and
   other users (or potential users) of explosive detection technology. The
   target audience may also consist of non-DOE entities to include
   physical security personnel in all levels of federal, state, and local
   governments, as well as the private sector.

   Course outcomes:
   Upon successful completion of the emerging technologies broadcast,
   attendees will be able to identify the following

     * The difference between bulk and trace detection technologies
     * The different applications of explosive detection technologies
         1. handheld technologies
         2. bench-top technology
         3. portal technology
     * The different key technologies used in explosive detection
         1. IMS
         2. X-ray
         3. TNA
     * The operational concepts for using explosive detection technology
     * The different types of personnel portals used for explosive
       detection
     * The different types of vehicular portals or technology used for
       vehicular explosive detection

   Prerequisites: None

   RECOMMENDATION: Students should be familiar with DOE
   notification/communication requirements and have emergency response
   experience.
