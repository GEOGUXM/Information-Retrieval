     SNfactory Gantt Chart
     ____________________________________________________________________

     This applet generates a Gantt chart based on the data provided in
     the following applet tab. The applet enables organizing projects and
     sub-projects into folders for easy browsing. The applet has a search
     function that facilitates filtering and viewing all the projects
     assigned to a team member or all the team members assigned to a
     given project. The applet also has a hotlink feature that enables
     accessing the team leader's or the team member's pages.

     Usage:
     * By default, the applet displays the remaining duration for the
       projects. However, by enabling the "FullView" checkbox the complete
       duration for the projects can be displayed.
     * Single-click on the horizontal rectangular bar to access the
       project leader's page.
     * Single-click on the folder/project name to see the
       sub-folders/sub-project names. When a folder is opened only that
       folder and its contents are visible. This feature enables browsing
       a large collection of project items in a compact browser window
       area.
     * Single-click on the folder's contents (with the "document" icon) to
       view the team member's page.
     * The search is case-insensitive. The search returns the complete
       hierarchy of the found document. (Example: "proj2"). The search
       feature enables filtering and browsing of all projects assigned to
       a resource or all projects handled by a given resource.
     * Each content item can be displayed in upto two lines.
     * Font size, style, color, English fonts on the buttons, buttons
       positioning etc can be altered using the applet's param options.
