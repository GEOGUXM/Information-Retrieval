                              Transit Security


     The FTAs Safety and Security Program goal is to achieve the highest
     practical level of safety and security for all modes of transit. In
     order to protect passengers, employees, revenues, and property, all
     transit systems are encouraged to develop and implement a proactive
       system security plan. FTA supports these efforts by developing
      guidelines, best practices, providing training and by conducting
         voluntary audits of individual agencies security programs.
