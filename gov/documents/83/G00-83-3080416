  Introduction

   The Food and Drug Administration publishes the Food Code, a reference
   that guides retail outlets such as restaurants and grocery stores and
   institutions such as nursing homes on how to prevent foodborne illness.

   Local, state and federal regulators use the FDA Food Code as a model to
   help develop or update their own food safety rules and to be consistent
   with national food regulatory policy. Also, many of the over 1 million
   retail food establishments apply Food Code provisions to their own
   operations.

   The Food Code is updated every two years, to coincide with the biennial
   meeting of the Conference for Food Protection. The conference is a
   group of representatives from regulatory agencies at all levels of
   government, the food industry, academia, and consumer organizations
   that works to improve food safety at the retail level.
