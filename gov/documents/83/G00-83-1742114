                Pictorial tour of the Fermilab 400 MeV Linac

   The Linac Group exists in the Accelerator Division within the Proton
   Source Department. We take gaseous hydrogen from a little bottle,
   inject it into the ion source, make negatively-charged hydrogen ions
   and extract them from the source at about 18,000 electron volts (18
   keV). The rest of the acceleration goes like this:

   C-W
   Pre-accelerator [c_w_small.jpg] Electrostatic accleration down the 750
   kV potential difference to ground for a final kinetic energy of about
   750 keV;
   750 keV
   Transfer Line [750line_small.gif] One transfer line is 10 meters long
   (H- line, "H-minus"), the other is 4 m long (I- line, "Eye-minus");
   201 MHz
   Drift Tube Linac [drift_tubes.gif] Accelerated in a 201.249 MHz
   drift-tube linac, though five large tanks, to 116 MeV; (This is a shot
   of the inside of Tank 2, which is, of course, normally closed up and
   under vacuum. The drift tubes, with the holes in the middle, are
   prominant. Also visible is a pumping port at the bottom, and the bulk
   tuner which emerges from lower left.)
   Transition Section

                            No picture available

   Compressed through a 4 m rf transition section to match the 201 MHz
   beam into the 805 MHz rf structure, and change the transverse focussing
   805 MHz
   Side-coupled Cavity
   Linac [linac_small.jpg] And finally through seven 804.996 MHz
   side-coupled cavity structures to the final energy of 401.5 MeV.
