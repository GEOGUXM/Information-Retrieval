   THE 1950's

   In 1945, American troops returned home, many starting new lives and
   families, Between 1946 and 1964, 76.4 million baby boomers were born,
   Over 13 million homes went up from 1948 to 1958, Most were affordable,
   cookie-cutter houses fashioned after the phenomenally successful
   Levittown, Long Island. William J. Levitt had pioneered the suburb by
   building neighborhoods of nearly identical, quickly built housing.
   America's movement to the suburbs spurred the growth of shopping malls,
   drive-ins, and supermarkets. Many saw the 1950's as a return to
   prosperity and social "normality."

   The prosperity and social normality was tinged with a "Red" hysteria,
   however. Americans saw communism on the march everywhere. By the end of
   the 1940's, Americans had seen the Soviets try to cut off Berlin from
   the West, Mao's Communist Party come to power in China, and the Soviet
   Union explode its first atomic bomb. In 1947, President Truman had
   outlined what became known as the Truman Doctrine: "I believe that it
   must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are
   resisting subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures," A
   State Department official, George Kennan, later fleshed out the Truman
   Doctrine, introducing the policy of "containment," which meant the
   United States would contain the Soviet Union's influence anywhere in
   the world. The "containment of the Communist threat" colored U,S.
   foreign policy decisions for decades to come.

   At home, politicians found it politically expedient to be hard on
   communism. A former Communist Party member charged former Roosevelt
   advisor, Alger Hiss, with being a Communist spy, Hiss denied the
   charges before the House Un-American Activities Committee, which
   investigated alleged communist subversion in the U.S, government. The
   statute of limitations protected Hiss from espionage charges, but he
   was later found guilty of perjury. At the same time, Americans learned
   that respected Los Alamos scientist Klaus Fuchs had been passing atomic
   secrets to the Soviet Union. Other conspirators testified that they had
   passed the secrets to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The Rosenbergs were
   convicted and executed as spies. Their defenders-then and now-claimed
   the Rosenbergs were framed, convicted, and executed in an anti-Semitic
   and anti-Communist frenzy.




   January 1950

   President Truman ordered the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to develop
   the hydrogen bomb (H-bomb). The hydrogen, or thermonuclear, bomb uses
   the same process that the sun uses to release tremendous energy. In the
   H-bomb, the nuclei of two light atoms (usually hydrogen) are fused
   together to form a heavier atom, helium. A fission reaction, one where
   a heavier atom is split into lighter ones, generates the energy to
   trigger the fusion reaction

   Edward Teller had begun theoretical work on the hydrogen bomb at Los
   Alamos Scientific Laboratory during World War II. After the war, he
   lobbied scientists, congressmen, the military, and the AEC to begin
   work on the hydrogen bomb. The General Advisory Committee of the AEC,
   chaired by Robert Oppenheimer, condemned the H-bomb on moral grounds as
   a "weapon of genocide." The committee also believed that developing the
   H-bomb would lead the United States into an arms race with the Soviet
   Union, The AEC and the President's advisors, however, were undecided.

   In January 1950, President Truman summoned his advisors and asked them
   one question, "Can the Soviets do this?" His advisors believed the
   Soviets could eventually develop a hydrogen bomb, and Truman decided to
   go ahead with its development. This decision triggered the
   establishment and/or expansion of three U.S. sites: Savannah River
   Plant, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, and Lawrence Livermore
   Laboratory. The United States exploded the H-bomb in November 1952 at
   the Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific.


   February 1950

   Senator Joseph McCarthy launched a crusade to rout out communism in
   America. During a speech before the Republican Women's Club of Ohio
   County in Wheeling, West Virginia, Senator McCarthy claimed that the
   State Department was infested with Communists, "I have in my hand 57
   cases of individuals who would appear to be either card-carrying
   members or certainly loyal to the Communist Party."

   Later many Americans became frustrated with U,S. involvement in the
   Korean War (see June 1950), and McCarthy tried to turn public
   resentment of the war to his political advantage by accusing a long
   series of public figures of communist sympathies. Accusing people of
   subversive or communist activity, without necessarily having evidence,
   became known as "McCarthyism."

   One prominent casualty of McCarthyism was Robert Oppenheimer, the
   leader of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory during the Manhattan Project
   and chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission's (AEC) General Advisory
   Council. A leading critic of the hydrogen bomb and of the United
   State's increasing reliance on atomic weapons for security, Oppenheimer
   had also been associated with some left-wing organizations in his past.
   After a closed hearing, the AEC declared him a security risk and
   removed him from his position.


   June 1950

   The Korean War began as North Korean forces invaded South Korea, The
   United Nations (U.N.) Security Council called for member nations to
   help South Korea repel the invasion, President Truman ordered the U.S,
   Air Force and Navy to Korea. Later, President Truman justified U.S.
   involvement in the Korean War in a speech to the nation:


   ''We are trying to prevent a third world war ...
       The communists in the Kremlin are engaged in a monstrous conspiracy
       to stamp out freedom all over the world. If they were to succeed,
       the United States would be numbered among their principal victims."

   In November 1950, China entered the war, sending U.N. forces into full
   retreat. President Truman hinted publicly that the United States might
   consider using atomic weapons to end the conflict. British Prime
   Minister Clement Atlee rushed to Washington to urge restraint. British
   and other European governments felt the United Nations should keep the
   war limited, fighting it only with conventional (non-nuclear) weapons.
   Many Americans, frustrated by U.S. involvement in the war, supported
   allowing General Douglas McArthur free rein to use atomic weapons to
   end it. In the end, no atomic weapons were used. But by the end of the
   war the U.S. nuclear arsenal had grown from 300 to 1,000 bombs.

   The threat of atomic weapons, however, may have been used
   diplomatically to end the fighting. In 1953, Secretary of State John
   Foster Dulles hinted that atomic weapons may be used. This may have
   brought the Chinese to the peace table. The peace treaty was signed in
   July 1953, but the cold war persisted. President Eisenhower said, "We
   have won an armistice on a single battleground-not peace in the world.
   We may not now relax our guard nor cease our quest."

   December 1951

   On December 20, 1951, the first usable electricity from nuclear energy
   was produced at the National Reactor Testing Station, later called the
   Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL), in Idaho Falls, Idaho.
   The electricity lit four light bulbs strung across a railing in the
   turbine room of the Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-1),

   The first reactor project approved by the Atomic Energy Commission,
   EBR-I was the brainchild of Walter Zinn, head of Argonne National
   Laboratory. In 1953, EBR-I scientists showed a reactor could create
   more fuel than it used; that is, the reactor could "breed" fuel as it
   created electricity. EBR-1 operated as a research reactor until 1963,
   when EBR-II took over. EBR-I is now a historical monument.

   October 1952

   Operations began at the Savannah River Plant (SRP) in Aiken, South
   Carolina with the start up of a heavy water plant. The Atomic Energy
   Commission (AEC) built SRP to produce materials, such as tritium and
   plutonium, for nuclear and thermonuclear (hydrogen) weapons. Tritium is
   a radioactive isotope, or form, of hydrogen used in thermonuclear
   weapons.

   The AEC chose the 200,000-acre site along the Savannah River in western
   South Carolina primarily for the millions of gallons of water available
   for cooling the production reactors, The AEC bought land from and
   relocated approximately 6,000 residents in six surrounding communities.

   December 1953

   On December 8, 1953, in his Atoms for Peace speech to the United
   Nations, President Eisenhower proposed joint international cooperation
   to develop peaceful applications of nuclear energy. He pledged the
   United States' determination "to help solve the fearful atomic
   dilemma-to devote its entire heart and mind to find the way by which
   the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his
   death, but consecrated to his life." He suggested that all nuclear
   nations turn over weapons-grade uranium and other materials to a
   proposed International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It could then share
   the materials with other nations for use in agriculture, medicine,
   electrical energy, and other peaceful uses. When the IAEA finally was
   formed in 1957, the Atomic Energy Commission offered 5,000 kilograms of
   uranium to the IAEA.

   Two months after his speech, President Eisenhower proposed an amendment
   to the Atomic Energy Act to permit the international cooperation he
   spoke of and to allow electric utilities to develop nuclear power
   plants.

   January 1954

   U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles announced the U.S. policy of
   massive retaliation. Shortly after taking office in 1953, President
   Eisenhower had adopted the New Look, a defense strategy relying heavily
   on nuclear rather than conventional weapons. In January 1954, Dulles
   framed this military strategy with a tough anti-Communist foreign
   policy. In the future, Dulles explained, the United States would not be
   drawn into expensive, limited conflicts like the one in Korea. Rather,
   in response to Communist aggression anywhere in the world, the United
   States might use "massive retaliatory power" applied "at places and
   with means of its own choosing." In other words, the United States
   would use nuclear weapons directly against the Soviet Union and China.


   January 1954

   Before the end of World War II, many in the Navy could see the
   potential for a nuclear powered submarine. Conventionally powered
   submarines had to surface regularly to recharge their batteries. A
   nuclear submarine could stay submerged for weeks or months. In 1948,
   the Navy put Captain Hyman Rickover in charge of developing a nuclear
   submarine. The Atomic Energy Commission also funded this work. The
   first nuclear submarine, U.S.S. Nautilus, was launched at Groton,
   Connecticut on January 21, 1954.

   In August 1958, the U,S.S. Nautilus sailed far beneath the Arctic ice
   and reached the North Pole. The original power core propelled the
   submarine for more than two years. Modern cores last 10 to 15 years. By
   1962, the Navy had 26 nuclear submarines and had launched two
   nuclear-propelled surface ships. The aircraft carrier U.S.S,
   Enterprise, powered by eight nuclear reactors, was launched in October
   1962 and is still in service.


   April 1954

   The Army-McCarthy hearings aired on television for five weeks. Senator
   Joseph McCarthy, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
   Investigations, charged that the Secretary of the Army, Robert T.
   Stevens, and Army Counsel, John G, Adams, were hampering the
   committee's attempts to uncover communists in the military. McCarthy
   failed to prove his charges, The hearings, given broad television and
   newspaper coverage, helped to end the anti-Communist witch hunt. By the
   end, Senator McCarthy was publicly disgraced. The Senate condemned
   McCarthy.


   August 1954

   The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 was passed to promote the peaceful uses
   of nuclear energy through private enterprise and to implement President
   Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace Program, The Act allowed the Atomic Energy
   Commission to license private companies to use nuclear materials and
   build and operate nuclear power plants. This act amended the Atomic
   Energy Act of 1946, which had placed complete power of atomic energy
   development in the hands of the Atomic Energy Commission.

   July 1955

   On July 17, 1955, Arco, Idaho became the first U.S town to be powered
   by nuclear energy. The demonstration lasted for one hour in the
   1,350-person community. The National Reactor Testing Station, now
   called the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, supplied the power
   from its Borax-III reactor. It was part of the Atomic Energy
   Commission's (AEC) Five-Year Reactor Development Program in the mid-]
   950's. The AEC tested five types of experimental reactors. The
   Borax-III was an early prototype of a boiling water reactor, a type of
   reactor which still produces electricity for utilities today.

   October 1956

   In February 1956, Soviet Premier Khrushchev denounced his predecessor,
   Josef Stalin, and his intolerance for other brands of communism. This
   gave hope to many in Eastern Europe who soon began demanding that their
   countries be able to determine their own fates, A labor dispute in
   Poland grew into national riots in mid-1956. The Soviets used force to
   stop the riots, but later compromised with the Polish by letting them
   choose the chairman of the Polish Communist Party. Meanwhile, Hungary's
   new government, backed by local revolutionary councils throughout
   Hungary, announced that it was pulling out of the Warsaw Pact and
   becoming neutral. The Warsaw Pact was a military alliance between the
   Soviet Union and Eastern bloc countries established in May 1955. In
   October 1956, Soviet troops moved in to crush the revolt. Hungarians
   appealed to the United States for help, but the United States was not
   able to do anything in Eastern Europe, short of all out war.


   November 1956

   During a diplomatic reception at the Kremlin, Soviet Premier Nikita
   Khrushchev told Western diplomats:



   "About the capitalist states, it doesn't depend on you whether we
       (Soviet Union) exist. If you don't like us, don't accept our
       invitations, and don't invite us to come to see you. Whether you
       like it our not, history is on our side. We will bury you."

   In 1959, while attending the American National Exhibition in Moscow,
   Vice-President Nixon, recalling Khrushchev's prediction that our
   grandchildren will live under communism, stated:


   "Let me say that we don't object to his saying this will happen, We
       only object if he tries to bring it about ... We prefer our system.
       But the very essence of our belief is that we do not and will not
       try to impose our system on anybody else. We believe that you and
       all other peoples on this earth should have the right to choose the
       kind of economic or political system which best fits your
       particular problems without any foreign intervention,"

   Both Khrushchev's and Nixon's statements fueled the anti-Communist
   sentiment prevalent in the United States.

   July 1957

   On July 12, 1957, the Sodium Reactor Experiment in Santa Susana,
   California generated the first power from a civilian nuclear reactor.
   Southern California Edison bought the electricity generated by the
   sodium-graphite reactor. It was part of the Atomic Energy Commission's
   (AEC) Five-Year Reactor Development Program in the mid-1950's. The AEC
   tested five types of experimental reactors, This reactor used sodium
   rather than water as a coolant. The reactor provided power until 1966.


   September 1957

   The United States set off the first underground nuclear test,
   code-named Rainier, in a mountain tunnel in the remote desert 100 miles
   from Las Vegas on September 19, 1957. Rainier was part of a series,
   known as Operation Plumbob, conducted at the Nevada Test Site to test
   warheads scheduled for production. Seismic waves from Rainier were
   detected 2,300 miles away in Alaska.


   October 1957

   The Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first spacecraft, on October 4,
   1957. Two months earlier the Soviet Union had fired the first
   intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). (An ICBM can be launched
   from one continent, pass through the atmosphere into space, and then
   re-enter the atmosphere over its target on another continent.) Both
   events shocked Americans because the Soviets had surpassed the United
   States in missile technology, The British Ambassador to the United
   States reported, "The Russian success in launching the satellite has
   been something equivalent to Pearl Harbor, The American cocksuredness
   is shaken." The Soviet Union launched Sputnik II in November 1957.

   Although the United States still led the Soviets in other weapons,
   Americans began to speak of a "missile gap. " The Gaither Report, a
   Ford Foundation Commission Study, fed popular fears that the United
   States was behind the Soviet Union and urged a Iarge military buildup.

   The United States launched its first satellite, Explorer 1, in January
   1958. The NationalAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was
   formed in July 1958 to continue development of spacecraft.

   Sputnik also jolted the American education system. The United States
   felt Soviet students must have been getting a better science and moth
   education than were American students. Congress passed the National
   Defense Education Act in September 1958 to fund new science, moth, and
   foreign language programs in American schools, One college president in
   the 1960's declared that colleges and universities had become "bastions
   of our defense, as essential as ... supersonic bombers."


   October 1957

   The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was formed to promote the
   peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to provide international safeguards
   and an inspection system to ensure nuclear materials aren't diverted
   from peaceful to military uses. IAEA is authorized to buy and sell
   nuclear materials and provide its member nations with technical
   assistance for non-military uses of nuclear energy. The IAEA also
   administers the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In signing the
   treaty, nations agree to certain safeguards, including IAEA inspections
   to monitor the flow of weapons-grade nuclear fuel. The inspections make
   sure that the fuel is not used for nuclear weapons.


   October 1957

   Radiation was released when the graphite core of the Windscale Nuclear
   Reactor in England caught fire. The first British plutonium production
   reactor, Windscale's Number 1 Pile began operating in October 1950;
   Windscale's second reactor began eight months later. On October 8,
   1957, a physicist operating Number I Pile accidentally let the core
   temperature rise to a point where the fuel began to melt. Forty-two
   hours later, instruments showed that radiation was being released, The
   reactor core was on fire. The fire was put out by flooding the reactor
   with water and sealing it off. The fire released a large amount of
   radioactive iodine and polonium, with half-lives of 8.05 days and 138.4
   days respectively, into the atmosphere. (A half-life is the time it
   takes a radioactive substance to lose half of its radioactivity.)
   Approximately 528,000 gallons of milk from forms within 200 miles of
   Windscale were destroyed, The extent of the radiation's effect on
   residents is still not fully known. A 1983 study by the Radiological
   Protection Board of Great Britain concluded two hundred and sixty cases
   of thyroid cancer were attributable to the release of radioactive
   iodine. Other forms of cancer, such as leukemia, have also been
   reported in the vicinity.


   December 1957

   The first large-scale nuclear powerplant in the world began operating
   in Shippingport, Pennsylvania, on December 2, 1957-exactly 15 years
   after Enrico Fermi demonstrated the first sustained nuclear reaction.
   In September 1954, President Eisenhower had waved a "magic wand" in a
   Denver television station to start the bulldozer at the Shippingport
   site. Symbolizing the peaceful use of the atom, the "magic wand"
   transmitted a neutron-powered electrical signal across the country to
   start the remote-controlled bulldozer. At no cost to the government,
   the Duquesne Light Company of Pittsburgh built and operated the
   Shippingport plant on a site it owned on the Ohio River, The company
   also contributed to the cost of developing the government -owned
   reactor. Three years later, the Shippingport plant began supplying
   electricity to the Pittsburgh area.

   October 1959

   The Dresden- I Nuclear Power Station in Illinois began operating. It
   was the first U,S. nuclear powerplant built entirely without government
   funding, Commonwealth Edison operated Dresden-1.
