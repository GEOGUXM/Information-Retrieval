                          Inclement Weather Policy

    When it appears that the local weather will compromise the safety of
   the public and court staff, the Clerk of Court will follow the lead of
      the Charlotte Mecklenburg School District. If the School District
   closes schools, the Clerk's Office will be closed. A message announcing
      the closing will be recorded on the Clerk's Office general phone
         number, (704-350-7500). A message regarding cancellation or
   postponement of court proceedings will be recorded on (704)-350-7575.
