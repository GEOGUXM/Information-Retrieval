   BACKGROUND: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been
   designated by OMB as the cognizant agency responsible for negotiating
   indirect, fringe benefit (and other specialty) rates and issuing
   related Rate Agreements for a significant number of organizations
   receiving Federal awards.

   Within this Department, the Division of Cost Allocation (DCA) is
   responsible for negotiating and approving rate(s) that should be used
   to determine amounts of indirect, fringe benefit and other types of
   cost to be included on a Federal award. The approval is formalized by
   issuance of a Rate Agreement signed by the cognizant agency and an
   authorized representative of the organization.

   SCOPE: This home page is limited to information concerning the
   applicable cost principles, and where to go to get additional
   information on proposal submission for: (i) Colleges and Universities,
   (ii) State and Local Governments, (iii) Hospitals and (iv) Other
   Nonprofit Organizations.
