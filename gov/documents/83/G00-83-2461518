   Technology Transfer

   The mission of the IV&V Facility technology transfer program is
   critical to accomplishing the overall vision and mission of the
   Facility. The development of a comprehensive technology program that
   transfers goods, services, and best practices to other NASA Centers,
   other government agencies, private companies, local governments and
   communities, and appropriate professional organizations, is essential
   to gaining national recognition. This mission includes strategies to
   move applied research into a production environment, as well as to
   communicate research results to government, business, academia, and the
   research community. This will be accomplished in order to facilitate
   partnering, training, technical assistance and the adoption of new and
   emerging validated tools and technologies by commercial customers.
   Therefore, the mission will discover new technology transfer methods
   that will bridge the gap between research and practice. This will
   include, but is not limited to, information dissemination, training and
   education, case studies, application projects, and the introduction of
   newly developed tools.
