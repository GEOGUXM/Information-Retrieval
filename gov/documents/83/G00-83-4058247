   Majorana Phase-II: 14 Detector Array

   The design seen here houses between twelve and sixteen detectors in an
   annular cryostat, surrounding one or two central detectors. One or both
   of the central detectors (one is in production) will be segmented with
   6 azimuthal and 2 axial contacts, as in Majorana, and have an ordinary
   cryostat (one crystal per cryostat).

   Several of the Majorana technical concepts of cooling, signal
   management, pulse-shape discrimination and background rejection, etc.
   will be tested in Majorana Phase-II:
