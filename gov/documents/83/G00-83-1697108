   Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA)3 Designated in 1994, this HIDTA region
   consists of six counties in Maryland, the City of Baltimore, the
   District of Columbia, the four counties in Northern Virginia contiguous
   to D.C., and the City of Alexandria, Virginia. There are 133 federal,
   state and local agencies participating in the Washington/Baltimore
   HIDTA. ÿ FY 2001 Drug-Free Communities Support Program Grantees awarded

   being used as crack houses. 43% of the residents live in poverty, 75%
   of the families have single heads of household, and 58% of the
   residents have not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent. This
   community falls within the Eastern District Police Command, the
   district that has had the highest crime rate per capita of any of the
   nine Baltimore districts for the past 4 years. * The following areas
   are additional Weed and Seed sites: West Baltimore, Project Garrison

   ÿ Maryland State Action Plans: * Heroin State Action Plan  Launched in
   April of 1998, this plan aims at preventing the spread of heroin use in
   Maryland and increasing the availability of treatment for heroin
   addiction.6 * Ecstasy State Action Plan  This initiative was launched
   on September 28, 2000 to combat the emerging trends in MDMA use
   throughout Maryland.7 ÿ Governor's Office of Crime Control and
   Prevention (GOCCP)8 This office helps to prepare and implement
   Maryland's Crime Control Plan Strategy. This Strategy focuses on four
   action areas: target high-risk offenders; reclaim at-risk
   neighborhoods; protect and support victims; and prevent youth violence,
   drug use, and gangs. * Break the Cycle: This GOCCP initiative is aimed
   at reducing drug-related crime and recidivism by revamping supervision
   and treatment services for drug- involved offenders. It is based on the
   principles of effective treatment and supervision incorporated in the
   Baltimore City Drug Treatment Court, the Correctional Options Program,
   Washington/Baltimore (W/B) HIDTA, and other specialized programs. BTC
   uses testing, treatment, and sanctions to retain the drug-involved
   offender in treatment services as a means to reduce recidivism and
   substance abuse. Crime and Drug-Related Crime9 ÿ In 1999, 7,717
