   1.    Purpose.     This chapter defines and assigns responsibility for
   the National Weather Service (NWS) directives system. This directives
   system, like operational climatological and observational records, is
   not covered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA) Filing System. The National Weather Service directives system
   serves to:

           a.    record delegation of authority;

           b.    promulgate policy;

           c.    define programs, procedures, and standards; and

           d.    establish quality control and augment training
   activities.

   Most chapter and operations manual letter directives are prepared at
   the NWS Headquarters in order to conserve the efforts of Regional
   Headquarters staffs and to provide an appropriate level of uniformity
   among regions. These permanent directives are kept on file until
   canceled or superseded.

   2.      Description.     The directives system consists of the
   following parts:

           Operations Manual    (2.1)
           Operations Manual Letter     (OML)    (2.2)
           Handbooks    (2.3)
           Regional Operations Manual Letters     (ROML)    (2.4)
           Memoranda    (2.5)
           Forms and Technical Aids     (2.6)

   These various parts are described below.

   2.1    Operations Manual.    The National Weather Service Operations
   Manual (WSOM) is the primary instrument of the NWS directives system.
   All permanent directives are to be filed in the manual, with the
   exception of:

           a.    handbooks     (2.3 and 2.3.4),

           b.    equipment manuals     (2.3.4), and

           c.    directives which relate to only one or a small number of
   units and/or are limited official use.

   All of these items are exempted from the NOAA Filing System control.

   * 2.1.1     Contents.    The Manual is divided into ten parts as listed
   below; each part consists of several chapters:

                   A - General

                   C - Basic/Public Services
                   D - Specialized Services
                   E - Hydrologic Services
                   F - Climatological and Oceanographic Services
                   G - Communications
                   H - Engineering
                   I   - NWS Career Development
                   J - Other Instructions

   procedures, and practices within the NWS.

   *           j.    Part J - Other Instructions - those directives that
   do not fall in any of the other parts.

   2.1.2    Indicating Manual Contents.    The contents of the manual will
   be indicated by:

               a.     Index of chapters and general table of contents
   filed before Part A.

               b.     Table of contents filed at the beginning of each
   part lists all chapter titles and issuance dates.

               c.     Table of contents at the beginning of each chapter
   lists all section, subsection, and sub-subsection titles and exhibits
   and appendices where applicable.

   2.1.3    Format for Chapters.    The format for all WS0M chapters is as
   follows.

               a.    Table of Contents.    It should follow the format of
   the table of contents at the beginning of this chapter. Page numbers
   appear in the table of contents for each chapter if the chapter is more
   than ten pages long. The text may begin on the same page if the table
   of contents is short (no more than one-half of a page).

               b.     Standard Entries First Page. Standard entries on the
   first page of each chapter (see first page of this chapter for an
   example) are:

               "Issue Date" - estimated date of delivery to the regions or
   effective date. The issue date will be entered by NO M's Administrative
   Systems Branch (AT/ IMS4) .

               "Org. Code" - organization code of the originating office.

               "Part" - letter identifying part in which chapter is to be
   filed.

               "Chapter" - chapter number in two digits (e,g., Chapter 3
   is entered as 03).

               "WSOM Issuance" - control number assigned serially by
   calendar year (e.g., 84-4 is used for the fourth issuance during
   calendar year 1984). Administrative Systems Branch (AT/IMS4) will enter
   this item.

   The first page of any chapter is typed on format paper and will not
   include a page number.

               c.    Standard Entries for Other Pages. All pages other
   than the first page of a chapter will have the following standard
   entries (typed on blank stock) as shown in this chapter.

                   (1)     Identification of Chapter and Part - title of
   chapter in capital letters followed by part letter and chapter number
   in parentheses at upper outside corner of each page. This entry will
   appear on the right side of odd pages and on the left side of even
   pages.

   *               (2)     Identification of Section - opposite the
   identification of chapter and part, the word "SECTION" in capital
   letters and the number of the section. The section number will be the
   same as the first line of text on that page. "SECTION" on exhibit pages
   will be the section that first refers to that particular exhibit.

                   (3)     Issuance Number and Date - issuance number and
   date on the bottom outside corner of each page. Administrative Systems
   Branch (AT/IMS4) will enter issuance number and date.

                   (4)     Page number - page number at the bottom center
   of each page.

               d.    Numbering Paragraphs. Paragraphs should be numbered
   following the example set in this chapter. Indent only numbered and
   lettered subdivisions. Paragraphs will not be indented. Progressive
   subdivisions of chapters are as  follows:

   1.             section (indention 10 spaces)

   1.1           subsection

   1.1.1        sub-subsection

   Numbered paragraphs will not be used below the sub-subsection. Any
   further sub-divisions of text will be indented and indicated as shown
   below:

   1 . 1 . 1
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

               a.
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

                   ( 1)
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

                           (a)
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

   The use of small letters to enumerate items for emphasis or clarity is
   recommended for within numbered sections or subsections where no
   further breakdown is required.

   *         e.    Identification of Exhibits.    The term "exhibit" will
   be used generically to cover all types of graphs, tables, and maps to
   which the reader is referred. Exhibits will be identified by chapter
   and numbered serially following the example set in this chapter.
   Exhibits should normally appear in the text at the point of first
   reference. Borders should be used on all exhibits with the exhibit
   number and title centered, outside the border, and at the bottom of the
   page.

   2.1.4    Technical Coordination and Review. The preparing office is
   responsible for coordinating manual material with appropriate offices,
   including W/MB1. Coordination with the Regional Headquarters is
   particularly important to minimize the need for supplementary
   instructions within individual regions.

   *2.1.5    Editorial Review.    The preparing office is responsible for
   editorial review. Executive Affairs (W/MB1) will review the material
   for compliance with instructions contained in this chapter (see 4.1).

   2.1.6    Transmittal Memorandum. Each manual chapter issuance will have
   a transmittal memorandum (see exhibit A-01-1). The memorandum will
   contain the following information.

               a.     "Material Transmitted" - identification of material
   transmitted, i.e., chapter number and title (and page numbers where
   appropriate).

               b.     "Summary" - a synopsis of important features and
   changes.

       *       c.    "Effect on Other Instructions" - remarks and/or
   instructions regarding other outstanding directives. If the issuance is
   a chapter, include chapter number, transmittal issuance, and date. For
   OML's, include OML number, issue date, and where it is filed.

   * 2.1.7     Indicating Changes.  Significant changes to an existing
   chapter will be indicated by placing an asterisk (*) in the left margin
   at the beginning of the paragraph(s) affected. An asterisk also will be
   placed in the table of contents of that chapter to the left of the
   affected section.

   * 2.1.8     Page Revisions. Page revisions will have an asterisk (*) at
   the beginning of the revised paragraphs, as stated in 2.1.7. Plus a
   revision number in the lower outside corner (leaving room for AT/IMS4
   to enter a new issuance number and date), as shown in the example
   below. Complete rewrites of chapters are not considered page revisions.

                   WSOM Issuance
                   83-22 12/29/83  (entered by AT/IMS4)
                   Rev. 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   [a011.gif] /wsom/manual/IMAGES/a011.gif
     __________________________________________________________________

   "Rev." indicates a page revision to a chapter and "1" indicates the
   first revision. The inventory list in the front of the Manual and table
   of contents in front of each part will also identify revisions to
   chapters.

   * 2.2    0perations Manual Letter (OML). The OML is a controlled letter
   directive issued by the NWS Headquarters. It is a semi-permanent
   directive to be incorporated into manual or handbook issuances as soon
   as possible (see exhibit A-01-2). OML's should not have page change
   issuances. If an OML is corrected, it should be an update of the entire
   letter not a page revision. (Instructions in 2.1.4 on coordination
   apply to the extent practicable.) WSOM chapter page revisions are
   preferred over OML issuances (see 2.1.8).

   2.2.1    Standard Entries. Standard entries for OML's are as follows:

               a.     The letters will be numbered consecutively followed
   by calendar year, e.g., OML 1-84 refers to the first such letter issued
   in 1984. Administrative Systems Branch (AT/IMS4) will make this entry.

               b.     "Date of  Issue" - date of estimated delivery to
   field offices. AT/IMS4 will make this entry.

               c      "Effective Date" - date on which the instruction is
   to be effective. AT/IMS4 will enter issuance date unless there are
   specific reasons for an earlier or later date.

               d.     "Subject" - self-evident.

               e.     "In Reply Refer To" - organizational code of the
   responsible unit.

               f.     "File With" - part and chapter after which the
   letter is to be filed.

   *          g.     "Reference(s)" - to existing chapters, OML's, or
   material that relates specifically to the particular OML.

   *          h.    Any canceled OML's will be indicated after the
   references and before the text.

   * When referencing chapters include chapter number, transmittal
   issuance, and date. In referring to or canceling OML's include OML
   number, issuance date, and where it is filed (the chapter part and
   number), e.g., OML 1-84 dated January 23, 1984, filed with B-60.

   * 2.2.2 Filing. Each OML will be filed behind the chapter to which it
   refers. Regional Operations Manual Letters (ROML) will be filed behind
   OML's. (See 2.3.3 for exception under which an attachment is filed
   elsewhere. See Appendix A for details on maintenance and filing.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [a012.gif] /wsom/manual/IMAGES/a012.gif
     __________________________________________________________________

   For example, A-01 would indicate that the letter is to be filed after
   WSOM Chapter A-01. If a letter does not relate to any particular
   chapter, it would be coded "99", i.e., A-99 would indicate that a
   letter is to be filed at the back of Part A. Extra copies of OML's may
   be filed elsewhere, even apart from the WSOM, as necessary.

   2.2.3    Use of Colored Paper. OML's will be printed on salmon-colored
   stock for easier recognition. This color will be used only for this
   purpose.

   2.3         Handbooks. The NWS uses approximately 200 manuals on
   observing, forecasting, communications, AFOS, codes, and engineering
   and maintenance. Most relate to engineering and maintenance; the system
   for this area is described in 2.3.4.

   * The following operational handbooks have been or will be issued
   within the next few years under current plans. Numbers are assigned as
   each handbook is issued.

   Please note that some of the most familiar manuals currently used are
   actually interagency manuals. These publications are discussed briefly
   in 2.3.5.

   2.3.1    Details of Preparation. In general, the structure and format
   of the Operations , as described in this chapter, should be employed
   (this includes paragraph numbering, tables of contents, labeling
   exhibits, etc.). In this connection, all pages of any new edition of a
   handbook should carry the appropriate handbook number and issuance date
   in the lower outside corner of each page following the example below:

               WSCH  #1   5/1/68

   where WSCH #1 represents National Weather Service Communications
   Handbook #1. When revised pages are issued to an existing edition, R1 -
   should precede the date, e.g.,

               WSCH  #1   R1-11/1/82

   indicating the first revision to Communications Handbook #1 and the
   date of the revision.

   Standard covers and inter-pages should be used following the
   instructions given in the NO M Directives Manual. Handbooks for all
   functional areas, except engineering, will use a standard color for the
   binder and cover (Observing - blue; Forecasting - green; Communications
   - gold; AFOS - white). Three-hole punching should be used.

   A transmittal memorandum similar to that described in 2.1.6 will be
   used to transmit all handbooks and engineering manuals (2.3.4) and
   changes thereto.

   2.3.2    Responsibility for Preparation. Each program office of the NWS
   Headquarters is responsible for handbooks relating to its functional
   area.

   2.3.3    Regional Supplements. The regions are not authorized to issue
   handbooks. Where there is a requirement to issue a voluminous set of
   regional operating instructions to supplement an NWS Headquarters
   handbook, such instructions should be prepared as an attachment to an
   ROML (2.4). The ROML should specify if the attachment is to be filed
   with a handbook as this would be a departure from instructions in
   2.2.2.

   2.3.4    Engineering and Maintenance Handbooks and Manuals. The
   Engineering Division maintains its own directives subsystem for
   detailed technical instructions not appropriate for inclusion as a WSOM
   chapter. This subsystem is described in WSOM Chapter H-98, "Engineering
   Directives Subsystem."

   2.3.5    Federal Handbooks. The NWS is responsible for the preparation
   of several interagency handbooks in cooperation with the Departments of
   Defense and Transportation.

              Federal Meteorological Handbooks:

               #1 - Surface Observations
               #2 - Synoptic Code
               #3 - Radiosonde Observations
               #4 - Radiosonde Code
               #5 - Winds-Aloft Observations
               #6 - Upper Wind Code
               #7 - Radar Observations
               #8 - Barometry
               #9 - Aviation Weather Observations (LAWRS & SAWRS)
               #10 - Rocketsonde Observations

   *2.4    Regional Operations Manual Letters (ROML). Each region will
   issue ROML's as permanent directives (see format exhibit A-01-3). Most
   ROML's should not have page revisions. They should be reissued as a new
   directive canceling entirely the incorrect version. Longer ROML's may
   have page revisions. Revisions should follow the same instructions as
   chapter page revisions (see 2.1.8). A new issuance number will be
   assigned ROML page revisions.

   *2.4.1    Coordination. The content of an ROML will be coordinated with
   the appropriate NWS program office to minimize interregional
   inconsistencies and possible duplication of effort among regions.

   *2.4.2    Standard Entries and Filing. The instructions on standard
   entries for ROML's will be the same as OML's (2.2.1) with one
   exception. Regions will prefix the issuance number by the letter
   signifying that region, e.g., E-01-84 for the first issuance of 1984 by
   the Eastern Region. ROML's will be filed behind OML's, or chapter when
   there are no OML's, of corresponding chapter and part (see 2.2.2 and
   appendix A).

   2.4.3    Use of Colored Paper. ROML's will be printed exclusively on
   green stock.

   *2.4.4    Copies for Washington Area. Copies of all ROML's are to be
   forwarded to Washington area as follows:

               a.     Executive Affairs (W/MB1) - 3 copies

               b.     NWS program office, and where appropriate, NOAA
   offices - 2 copies

   *2.5    Memoranda. Manual chapters, OML's, ROML's, handbooks, and
   engineering manuals are for material which is to be kept on file until
   a later instruction supersedes or cancels it. Memoranda will be used
   for one-time instructions issued by the NWS and Regional Headquarters.
   Letterhead stationery will be used to transmit one-time instructions
   (see exhibit A-01-4). The addressees do not necessarily have to
   coincide with the distribution list for Operations Manual material.
   Copies of all memoranda relating to the WSOM should be provided to the
   following.

               a.     Executive Affairs (W/MB1) -- 1 copy

               b.     NWS Headquarters program office -- 1 copy

   2.6         Forms and Technical Aids. All operational forms and
   technical aids prescribed in WSOM chapters and handbooks are considered
   part of the NWS directives system. As they are issued, they will be
   identified as indicated below.

   Forms will be numbered serially by manual part as per the following
   example:

               WS  Form  B-1

   where "B" indicates that the form relates to data acquisition and is
   covered in the "B" part of the manual (or in an Observing Handbook
   relating to "B" part of the manual) and the "1" signifies that this is
   the first such "B" form issued.

   Technical Aids (TA) will also be tied into a specific manual part and
   will be identified as in the following example:

               WS  TA  B-1

   NWS forms and technical aids are listed in the NOAA Forms Catalog.

   The above instructions apply only to Weather Service forms. Forms
   specified in Federal Meteorological Handbooks (FMH) are identified in
   the example below:

               MF 1-10

   where "MF" refers to Meteorological Form; "1" refers to FMH #1; and
   "10" is the specific form number.

   3.         Issuing Authority. This section defines authority to issue
   directives.

   *3.1    National Weather Service Headquarters (WSH). WSH directives
   material, with the exceptions noted below, will be signed by the
   Assistant Administrator or Deputy, National Weather Service. In the
   case of routine instructions and notes addressed only to
   electronics/facilities technicians and intended for filing in
   Engineering Division handbooks or manuals, the signing official will be
   the Chief, Engineering Division, Office of Technical Services. The AFOS
   Handbook series, the signing official is the Chief, AFOS Operations
   Division.

   3.2         Regional Headquarters. The Regional Director is authorized
   to issue ROML's. This authority may be redelegated. All redelegations
   are to be defined in an ROML.

   4.        System Management. This section defines overall
   responsibility for the management of the directives system and provides
   instructions on the distribution and inventorying of directive
   material.

   *4.1    Responsibility. Responsibility for the NWS directives system is
   assigned to Executive Affairs (W/MB1). Comments and inquiries relating
   to the overall directives system should be addressed to this office.
   Comments and inquiries on particular WSH directives should be addressed
   to the originating office. The organization code of the originating
   office appears on the first page of both chapters and OML's. Address
   the appropriate program office in the case of handbooks.

   *4.2    Distribution. The Operations Manual will be maintained by
   appropriate organizational elements. As a minimum, one copy of the
   Manual will be maintained by each of the following offices:

               a.     All NWS field offices

               b.     All NWS Regional Headquarters

               c.     NWS Headquarters Offices

   * Detailed distribution lists which go beyond the above will be kept
   current by the WSH and Regional Headquarters. Changes to WSH lists will
   be forwarded to Executive Affairs (W/MB1). Additional copies of manual
   material will be distributed to outside groups (e.g., Air Weather
   Service, Air Transport Association, etc.), as indicated on the
   distribution list accompanying the printing requisition.

   ROML's will be distributed to all regional elements that maintain the
   Manual, appropriate WSH elements (4.3.2), and outside groups and
   agencies as necessary.

   Handbooks and engineering/maintenance manuals will be distributed to
   appropriate field and supervisory personnel.

   WSH and Regional Headquarters memoranda will be distributed on the
   basis of the subject matter (see 2.5).

   4.3         Inventory Procedure. This subsection defines inventory
   procedures for current directives issued by WSH and the Regional
   Headquarters.

   4.3.1    National Weather Service Headquarters. Executive Affairs
   (W/MB1) will maintain a complete listing of all current Operations
   Manual chapters and OML's issued. A listing of chapters and OML's in
   effect will be issued periodically to all holders of the manual, and
   other groups who receive these directives. The individual program
   offices are responsible for the management and control of handbook
   materials and are to take measures necessary to provide for the
   inventorying and purging of such materials.

   *4.3.2    Regional Headquarters. Each region should periodically issue
   a listing of ROML's in effect. Copies of regional listings are to be
   provided to the following offices:

               a.     Executive Affairs (W/MB1) -- 3

               b.     Office of Hydrology (W/OH) -- 2
