   The Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (PL101-391) was passed into
   law by Congress to save lives and protect property by promoting fire
   and life safety in hotels, motels and other places of public
   accommodation. The law mandates that federal employees on travel must
   stay in public accommodations that adhere to the life safety
   requirements in the legislation guidelines. PL101-391 also states that
   federally funded meetings and conferences cannot be held in properties
   that do not comply with the law. PL101-391 is applicable to all places
   of public accommodation, and requires that such properties are equipped
   with:
     * hard-wired, single-station smoke detectors in each guestroom in
       accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)
       standard 72;
     * an automatic sprinkler system, with a sprinkler head in each guest
       room in compliance with NFPA standards 13 or 13R. Properties three
       stories or lower in height are exempt from the sprinkler
       requirement.
