   Is it possible that you or someone you know may be owed a pension
   benefit without knowing it? If you worked for a company in the past
   that went out of business or ended its defined benefit pension plan,
   you may be entitled to pension money. PBGC is looking for over 12,000
   people who are owed pension money.

   Although the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has been successful
   in reuniting many people with their pensions, the people listed in our
   Pension Search Directory have not been located yet. We are determined
   to find them. With your help, we can return to them what is legally
   theirs.
