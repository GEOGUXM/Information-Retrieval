   ESTIMATES FROM THE 1997 NRI DATABASE (REVISED DECEMBER 2000)
   REPLACE ALL PREVIOUS REPORTS AND ESTIMATES.   Comparisons made
   using data published for the 1982, 1987, or 1992 NRI may produce
   erroneous
   results. This is due to changes in statistical estimation protocols,
   and because
   all data collected prior to 1997 were simultaneously reviewed (edited)
   as 1997
   NRI data were collected.  All definitions are available in the
   glossary.  In addition,
   this December 2000 revision of the 1997 NRI data updates
   information released
   in December 1999 and corrects a computer error discovered in March
   2000.
