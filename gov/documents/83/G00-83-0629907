   NOTE:
   TSDIS will provide support for registered TSDIS Science Users (TSUs)
   only. TSU's may contact tsdis@tsdis.gsfc.nasa.gov with questions about
   the TSDIS software.

   If you are not a TSU (or working with a TSU), please use the software
   at your own risk and contact the Goddard DAAC if you have any questions
   about TSDIS software.

   [icntool.gif] TSDIS Science Algorithm Toolkit

   To help the TSDIS Science Users (TSUs) develop the TRMM algorithms,
   TSDIS has provided the TSDIS Science Algorithm Toolkit. The purpose of
   the toolkit is two-fold. First, the toolkit provides a library of
   commonly used routines, constants, and macros, and, secondly, it allow
   seamless integration of TRMM algorithms into the TSDIS environment.

   In developing algorithms for TSDIS, the TSUs must interact with HDF
   files for TSDIS standard products. The toolkit provides routines for
   reading and writing data to and from the HDF files; routines are
   provide for Level 1-3 products and for both satellite and GV. Each of
   the routines in the toolkit are callable in either C or FORTRAN. The
   toolkit also includes routines for reading land/sea data and
   topographical data. The routines provided in the toolkit can be divided
   into the following categories:
     * File Access (e.g., open/close routines)
     * Data Access (e.g., read/write routines)
     * Metadata Access (e.g., reading and writing metadata elements)
     * Ancillary Data Access (e.g., land/sea or topographical data access)
     * Error Reporting Utilities.

   For more information about the TSDIS Toolkit or to download the
   toolkit, please see the TSDIS Toolkit Homepage.

   [TSDISBrowseViewer1.sm.gif] TSDIS Browse Viewer

   The TSDIS Browse Viewer is a GUI application that provides the means to
   display the TSDIS produced browse images. The browse viewer is capable
   of displaying Level 1-3 of Satellite and GV browse images. The images
   are subsampled before they are displayed on the users terminal, but the
   browse viewer includes the option of zooming the images to full
   resolution. The browse viewer application provides the following
   functionality:
     * Display Level 1-3 of Satellite and GV Browse Images
     * Turn On/Off Continental Outlines
     * Turn On/Off Latitude/Longitude Grids
     * Turn On/Off GV Sources
     * Turn On/Off Time Indicators
     * Zooming the Browse Image
     * View Core/Product Specific/Browse Metadata
     * Change the Overlay Colors
     * Change the Grid Resolution
     * Save the Browse Images in either HDF or PostScript Format.

   In addition to the browse images, the Viewer will display the
   associated color bar (including scale) and the current cursor position
   in latitude/longitude coordinates (if appropriate).

   Requirements:
     * IDL (either development or runtime version) - required Version 5.0
     * 2 MB Diskspace
     * Memory will depend on image size.
     * Platform: UNIX (with IDL)

   The current release of the Browse Viewer is Version 1.8.

   [release_main_sm.gif] TSDIS Orbit Viewer
   The TSDIS Orbit Viewer displays TRMM Standard Products,
   Coincidence-Subsetted Intermediate (CSI) Products, and Quick Look (QL)
   Products. Only satellite products, levels 1B through 3, can be
   displayed. The viewer can display all data in the files, including SDS
   variables, V data, and metadata.
   For level 1 and 2 products, the entire orbit can be viewed at once, and
   a portion of the orbit can be zoomed to reveal detail. Both horizontal
   and vertical slices of the zoomed region can be viewed. The sample
   images on the right demonstrate these capabilities.
   For level 3 products, the entire tropics can be viewed at once, and a
   portion of the tropics can be zoomed to reveal detail.

   For more information about the TSDIS Orbit Viewer or to download the
   viewer, please see the TSDIS Orbit Viewer Homepage.

   VIRS L1B Radiance Converter

   The 1B01 Calibration software creates an alternative VIRS L1B product.
   It converts the 1B01 radiances to percent albedo for visible channels
   and to brightness temperatures for thermal channels. The output has the
   same HDF format as the 1B01 product and all 1B01 parameters except
   radiances are carried over.

   The software is written in c. The TSDIS toolkit and a few HDF routines
   are used and included in this software package.

   The VIRS L1B converter can be obtained using the TSDIS anonymous FTP
   site:

   UNIX> cd ~
       UNIX> ftp ftp-tsdis.gsfc.nasa.gov
       user: anonymous
       password: enter your e-mail address
       FTP> cd pub/convertvirs
       FTP> mget 1B01CALTB.tar
       FTP> quit
