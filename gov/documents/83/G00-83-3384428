   NOAA's CoastWatch Program makes data and imagery available from a
   variety of sensors and satellites. Deciding which satellite data to
   view or download depends on the type of information that is needed. The
   three most common data types are those that show sea surface
   temperature, ocean surface winds, or ocean color. These products can be
   browsed online at the CoastWatch Ocean Products Server.

   The images displayed on the CoastWatch websites are created from
   satellite datasets. These datasets are self-contained meaning they hold
   more than just the information required to produce an image. CoastWatch
   data products are not viewable by Internet browsers and may require
   specialized software to view, manipulate, and extract the information
   from the dataset. For many uses, CoastWatch images provide enough
   infomation and are easily viewed over the Internet.

   There are many uses for each type of image. Temperature images for
   instance, are used to locate fishing spots and for forecasting weather.
   Ocean color images help scientists track changes in the ocean, and sea
   surface wind images are used primarily by meteorologists and boaters.
   Each image and dataset is available in near real-time, which means the
   image is just a few hours old. NOAA CoastWatch provides software
   utilities and data primers to assist in using the data products:

   Note: Some products require registration. Each product description area
   clearly states if access to the image's corresponding dataset requires
   registration.

Sea Surface Temperature (SST)


   Image: Sea surface temperature image from NOAA geostationary spacecraft
   View Products NOAA Geostationary Spacecraft (Geostationary Operational
   Environmental Satellites - GOES)
   Sensor:  Imager
   Products:  Sea surface temperature (6km resolution, GIF, GeoTIFF, or
   binary)
   Distribution:  Ocean Product Server
   Registration Required?  No
   More Information
   NOAA CoastWatch Central Operations provides sea surface temperature
   (SST) products derived from NOAA's Geostationary Operational
   Environmental Satellites (GOES). Sea surface temperature products from
   GOES for the coastal United States are available through the NOAA
   CoastWatch Ocean Product Server and are updated 8 times per day (every
   3 hours) and are available in near real-time.

   Register NOAA Polar Spacecraft (Polar Operational Environmental
   Satellites - POES)
   Sensor:  Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)
   Products: Sea surface temperature, Cloud masks, Channel data (albedo)
   (1km or 4km resolution, HDF)
   Distribution:  CoastWatch Regional Nodes
   Registration Required?  Yes (for data products --Register for Data--)
   NOAA CoastWatch sea surface temperature (SST) Images are produced by
   NESDIS Information Processing Division using data from NOAA Polar
   Operational Environmental Satellites (POES). CoastWatch SST Images are
   produced from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data
   four times daily for the coastal waters of the United States. Sea
   surface temperature products may be browsed online without registration
   (only access to data products requires registration). Near real-time
   data may be obtained (after registration) from the Regional Nodes;
   retrospective data may be obtained from the Satellite Active Archive.
   Before applying for access to CoastWatch data products, determine which
   node best covers your area-of-interest and then register.

Ocean Color

   Image: Purchased SeaWiFS data - Chlorophyll-a product
   View Products OrbView-2
   Sensors:  SeaWiFS
   Products:  Ocean Color (chlorophyll-a, k_490, etc.) (GIF, GeoTIFF, HDF)
   Distribution:  Ocean Product Server
   Registration Required?  Yes.
   More information
   Turbidity and Chlorophyll-a products are generated using NOAA developed
   algorithms from ocean color sensors. At present, data products produced
   using SeaWiFS data are restricted due to limitations associated with
   these commercial data (Data Use Policy). NOAA plans to use MODIS data
   in the near future and these products will be open to the public.

Ocean Surface Winds

   Image: Image of satellite ocean winds (QuikScat)
   View Products ERS-2, Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, QuikSCAT
   Sensors:  AMI, SSM/I, SeaWinds
   Products:  Global ocean surface winds
   Distribution:  Ocean Product Server
   Registration Required?  No
   More information
   Data from ERS-2, DMSP, and QuikSCAT satellites are processed and mapped
   to produce ocean surface wind products. These products are publicly
   available within hours of the satellite pass.
