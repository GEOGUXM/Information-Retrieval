   BEP for Kids

   Visit the BEP for Kids Flash Site Here The primary goal of the Money
   Central Station area (Kid's Area) on Moneyfactory.com is to educate
   children ages 5 to 13 about the anti-counterfeiting features that are
   present in the new 1996 and 1999 Series Federal Reserve Notes. Money
   Central Station achieves this goal through the use of various
   interactive displays and games for kids. Click here to go to the Flash
   Macromedia Kids site.

   NOTE: *All the games require the user to have Macromedia Flash Player.
