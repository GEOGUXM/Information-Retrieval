           OUTREACH AWARD

                             [small_plaque.jpg]

   In February, Goddard Space Flight Center held an annual awards ceremony
   to recognize some of the programs that are being pioneered by
   scientists here. Our program was awarded an "Excellence in Outreach"
   plaque, which is now hanging on the wall in our GVAR lab. Click on the
   picture to the left for more!

                                  RESULTS
   We're strong believers in the notion that actions speak louder than
   words. Rather than having us tell you how well our program works, why
   not look at what the students themselves are producing? Here's a great
   example from Michaela Gruzensky, a fourteen year old "home-schooler".

                              FEATURED STUDENTS
   Check out the latest featured student, Adam Siegel, and his work on the
   Mathematical Moon. His research has focused on discovering the causes
   behind some peculiarities in recent GOES imagery.
   And take a look at the recent work of Rochelle and Erin Callen
   concerning El Niño, The Universal Culprit. Their page provides a
   detailed explanation of the El Niño and its effects, accompanied by
   excellent graphics.
                             STUDENT PROJECTS
   The GVAR Student Challenge contains a gallery of student work, images
   and links to web pages they've designed and created themselves. Check
   out the latest COOL Links to projects our students have been working
   on.
