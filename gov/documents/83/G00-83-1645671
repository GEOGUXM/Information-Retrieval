   NAVIGATING YOUR WAY THROUGH THE
   AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK WEB SITE
   In order for U.S. companies to successfully compete at
   the multilateral development banks, they need to know
   where to find timely and accurate information. With
   the advent of the Internet, information that used to take
   weeks to obtain can now be found in a matter of
   minutes. The purpose of this article is to assist U.S.
   firms in navigating the African Development Bank
   (AfDB) web site and finding quickly information that
   they are seeking.
   While the AfDB Internet site should be used as a tool
   for U.S. firms, it should not replace the assistance and
   guidance that the African Development Bank
   Commercial Liaison Office can offer.
   The African Development Bank Internet Site
   The AfDB Internet site can be found at:
   http://www.afdb.org
   Companies should be aware that while the majority of
   information found on this web site is in English, many
   documents are in French.
   Below are some categories that comprise the AfDB
   homepage. Each category contains information useful
   for U.S. companies interested in competing for AfDB-financed
   projects. Most companies will find the
   section Opportunities most helpful. A brief summary
   of each section highlighting information of interest to
   business community follows.
   (http://www.afdb.org/about.html)
   The ADB Group category provides an overview of the
   AfDB, its vision, an organizational chart, and detailed
   information and webpages on specific initiatives and
   departments with the AfDB.
   Under the section, About AfDB, one can find
   historical data on the Bank as well as a list of AfDB
   Governors and Alternate Governors, and a staff
   departmental directory. This section also provides
   information on specific initiatives and departments
   within the AfDB.
   Of particular relevance to U.S. companies are the
   Environment and Sustainable Development Unit
   (OESU), the Central Operations Department (OCOD),
   and the Private Sector Department (OPSD) web pages.
   OESU's web site contains environmental guidelines,
   Country Environmental Profiles, and various
   monographs. Many of these monographs are related to
   the themes of environment, gender, poverty reduction,
   population, and community participation. OCOD
   includes Sectoral Operation Policies on its web site.
   OPSD has included not only general information on
   private sector lending, but also AfDB private sector
   contact officers, and briefs of approved private sector
   projects.
   News and Information
   (http://www.afdb/org/events/home_events.htm)
   Sections within this category that will be relevant to
   U.S. companies include news releases and a special
   event calendar.
   News Releases: In this section, the AfDB post new
   releases highlighting important events at, or actions
   taken by, the Bank. These include the approval of new
   projects, seminars or meetings being held, and other
   information that the AfDB believes is newsworthy.
   Special Events Schedule: The AfDB has created a
   section on its web site for special events. This page,
   for example, may include the program and schedule of
   the AfDB annual meeting.
   Country Operations
   (http://www.afdb.org/african_countries/home_country.htm)
   On this page, a Country Fact Sheet will be found for
   each regional member. In addition to general
   information and basic economic indicators, these fact
   sheets include two valuable resources for companies
   interested in participating in AfDB-financed activities
   --the Country Strategy Paper, and Project Information
   Sheets.
   Opportunities
   (http://www.afdb.org/opportunities/home_opportunities_
   home.htm)
   The Opportunities category is perhaps the most
   important site on the AfDB homepage for U.S.
   companies interested in pursuing Bank-financed
   projects. Two sections of interest are Business
   Opportunities, and Private Sector Lending Window.
   Business Opportunities: The Business Opportunities,
   page is broken down into the following subsections:
   procurement of goods and works, use of consultants,
   procurement notices ADB Business Bulletin, loan
   approvals, and ADB rates.
   The Procurement of Goods subsection includes rules
   of procedures for goods and works, standard
   procurement documents, and the Annual Procurement
   Report. The standard procurement documents,
   available in both Word and PDF files, is downloadable
   and includes specific instructions and samples.
   In the subsection of Use of Consultants, the AfDB has
   placed the consultant rules and procedures, standard
   request for proposals for consultants, and the AfDB
   Database on Consultants (ADB Dacon) registration
   form. The standard request for proposals documents
   are available as both Word and PDF files.
   ADB Dacon is a database of consulting firms
   interested in pursuing AfDB opportunities. The AfDB
   requires that consultants interested in participating in
   its financed programs register on the database. This
   can be done by either downloading a program through
   the Internet or by requesting a CD-ROM from the
   AfDB.
