     __________________________________________________________________

   To support his vision for creating a Government that works better and
   costs less, President Clinton has directed that all Executive
   Departments and Agencies adopt a process whereby employees who see
   opportunities to increase program efficiency can request approval (or a
   waiver) to deviate from an existing internal rule. An internal rule is
   defined as any policy, regulation, procedure or process that an agency
   official has authority to waive. As the Secretary stated in his recent
   memorandum to all employees, the process is intended to promote an
   environment which allows individuals to submit waivers to create
   positive change for the benefit of their organization as a whole to
   advance DOT's strategic goals.

   To advocate innovative ideas and advance the President's goal,
   Secretary Slater has directed each Operating Administration to
   establish a streamlined process that encourages the use of waivers and
   incorporates the eleven principles outlined in the Departmental Waiver
   Framework. Using this process, an employee may submit a waiver request
   to an appropriate approving official. Approving officials cannot deny
   waiver requests--in order for the waiver process to stop at this level,
   they must approve them. If they are unable to approve them, they must
   forward them to the Deputy Administrator, who serves as the "Champion"
   of the waiver process, for final decision. At this level, requests may
   be denied only for the specific reasons prescribed in the Departmental
   Framework.

   In addition to granting individual waivers, the Secretary also
   encourages managers to be proactive by consulting with customers and
   employees about opportunities for granting "up-front" waivers that
   would result in increased program efficiency. In keeping with the
   spirit of the Departmental Waiver Framework, I am granting the
   following "up-front" waivers effective immediately.
     Annual Travel Orders: Issuance of annual travel orders for Associate
       Administrators and Staff Office Directors (including the Director,
       Volpe National Transportation Systems Center).
     Non-Federal Reimbursable Agreements (Incremental Funding): Authority
       to approve incremental funding, within the upper funding limit of
       originally approved non-Federal reimbursable agreements, is
       delegated to the Director of the Volpe National Transportation
       Systems Center, except with respect to agreements with foreign
       governments and foreign private entities.
     Invitational Travel: Authority to approve domestic invitational
       travel for government employees (this includes Federal, state,
       local, municipal etc.) is delegated to Associate Administrators and
       Staff Office Directors (including the Director, Volpe National
       Transportation Systems Center).

   All "up-front" waivers and waiver requests, whether approved or
   disapproved, will be posted on DOT and RSPA waiver websites. The DOT
   website will include Departmentwide waivers, the DOT Waiver Framework,
   and a set of questions and answers to help employees understand the
   implications of the Framework. The DOT website address is:
   http://waiver.dot.gov. It will contain a link to each Operating
   Administration's specific waiver process and waiver requests. RSPA's
   Waiver Process and waiver requests can also be accessed through RSPA's
   homepage at http://www.rspa.dot.gov. A copy of RSPA's Waiver Process is
   also attached to this memorandum.

   I encourage RSPA employees to identify better ways of doing business
   and submit innovative ideas to change internal rules that will result
   in an organization that works better, costs less and gets results. I
   challenge each of you to examine how this process can help make our
   organization work better to serve our customers.

                RESEARCH AND SPECIAL PROGRAMS ADMINISTRATION
                               WAIVER PROCESS

   I. PURPOSE.

   This document implements the RSPA Waiver Process and establishes
   policies and procedures for employees to request waivers to deviate
   from existing internal rules to achieve better ways of doing business.
   The process is intended to promote an environment which allows
   individuals to submit waivers to create positive change for the benefit
   of their organization as a whole to advance DOT's strategic goals.
   Under Departmental policy, the waiver process does not apply to
   discretionary management decisions to run an office such as workload
   distribution, work hours, telecommuting, etc.

   II. BACKGROUND:
   President Clinton issued a memorandum directing heads of Executive
   departments and agencies to adopt streamlined processes to grant
   waivers to internal rules to enhance operational efficiency.

   In a memorandum to heads of operating administrations (OAs), the
   Secretary of Transportation issued a DOT Waiver Framework with eleven
   features to be used by each OA in their streamlined waiver process. The
   Secretary also issued the following policy statement:

   "DOT should actively use waivers as a tool to create managerial and
   operational flexibility to meet the challenges of the transportation
   system of the 21st Century. Therefore, I am directing all DOT officials
   who can waive internal rules, regulations, policies, procedures,
   processes, etc. to approve waiver requests from DOT employees whenever
   feasible and not disapprove any request unless there is a compelling
   reason to do so."

   III. POLICY IMPLEMENTATION.

   All Employees are encouraged to step up to the challenge of finding
   better ways of doing business and submit innovative ideas to change
   rules, regulations, policies, procedures and processes that would
   result in an organization that works better, costs less and gets
   results. All RSPA officials having authority to waive an internal rule
   are to keep an open mind that a better way may exist, demonstrate a
   "can do" attitude during any consultation regarding a potential waiver,
   and take the initiative to review rules to see if "up front" waivers
   should be offered and offer waivers on their own cognizance.

   For employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements at
   the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, the requirements of
   the agreements must be applied as well. To the extent that conflicts
   between an existing collective bargaining agreement and this process
   exist, the collective bargaining agreement will prevail.

   I V . DEFINITIONS .

     a. Rule. For the purposes of this waiver process, rule means any
     internal rule, regulation, policy, procedure or process that a RSPA
     official has the authority to waive.

     b. Waiver. A waiver is the ability to deviate from an existing
     internal rule. It is given as a delegation of authority from an
     individual having authority to change or disregard an internal rule.

     c. Approving Official. The approving official is the individual
     within RSPA that has the authority to change or disregard the rule
     in question.

     d. Process Owners. The requester and approving official are the
     process owners who in partnership assess labor relations and other
     technical or legal issues during the consultation phase, ensure that
     time frames outlined in this process are met, and assess waivers to
     determine their operational effectiveness.

     e. Independent Official. The independent official is the "champion"
     for the waiver process and is the only one who can disapprove a
     waiver request. For RSPA, the waiver "champion" is the Deputy
     Administrator.

   V. PROCEDURE.

     a. The employee:

     1) Determines which rule(s) is to be waived and the applicable
     approving official. An employees may wish to first discuss the idea
     with his/her colleagues and supervisor. These people can assist in
     identifying the applicable approving official.

     2) Contacts the approving official by memorandum or E-mail outlining
     what rule s/he is interested in having waived and the organizational
     benefits that would result by adopting the waiver. The receipt of
     the memo or E-mail begins the partnership between the requester and
     approving official as process owners. During this step, the process
     owners will assess labor relations and other technical or legal
     issues that should be considered. Although consultation adds a step
     to the process, experience has shown it to be beneficialin saving
     time and improving quality. If the approving official does not
     respond within 30 calendar days to the request for consultation, the
     employee may submit the waiver request to the approving official.

     3) Submits the waiver request on DOT 1001 (RSPA Revised), Waiver
     Request form (Appendix A), by forwarding it to the RSPA approving
     official with a copy to the RSPA Deputy Administrator (marked "For
     Information Only"), who serves as the independent official
     designated as the "champion" for the waiver process. The approving
     official has 30 days to make a decision. The Waiver Request form
     asks what specific requirement the employee wants waived, what
     organizational benefits the employee hopes to achieve, and how long
     the waiver is to be in effect. If the waiver is successful, a
     permanent change should be considered. Since waiver requests to
     discretionary management decisions such as workload distribution,
     work hours, telecommuting, etc. are excluded from the waiver
     provisions, they can be returned unprocessed. However, these matters
     are open to discussion between supervisors and employees at any
     time.

     b. The approving official:

     1) Approves the request, returns it to the requester, and forwards a
     copy immediately to the IRM Manager, DMA-14, to post on the RSPA
     waiver website. The approving official has 30 days to make a
     decision.

     2) Or recommends disapproval and forwards the request with
     sufficient justification for disapproval to the Deputy Administrator
     within 20 calendar days of the submittal date on the request form.
     This provides the Deputy Administrator 10 calendar days to act on
     the waiver request. If, after the 30 day period, notification of a
     decision on the request (or an extension) is not made by the Deputy
     Administrator, the request is approved by default and the approving
     official will (1) annotate the request approval line to read:
     "Approved by Default" and the date indicating that the 30 day time
     frame has expired , (2) return the request to the requester with
     notification that the waiver may begin, and (3) forward a copy
     immediately to the IRM Manager, DMA-14, to post on the RSPA waiver
     website.

     c. The Deputy Administrator:

     1) Performs an independent review and approves or disapproves the
     request. For those requests forwarded for his action, the Deputy
     Administrator's decision is final. Once approved or disapproved, the
     Deputy Administrator returns a copy of the waiver request to the
     approving official who provides a copy immediately to the requester
     and the IRM Manager, DMA-14, to post on the RSPA waiver website.

     2) The Deputy may extend the 30-day period for up to an additional
     30 calendar days, if necessary. If extended, the Deputy advises the
     approving official (who immediately notifies the requester).

     3) If, after 30 days, notification of a decision on the request (or
     an extension) is not made by the Deputy Administrator, the request
     is approved by default.

   VI. WAIVER EXCEPTIONS. A waiver request may be disapproved in limited
   circumstances. These include:

     a. Lack of authority, such as when a Governmentwide regulation or
     policy cannot be waived by a DOT official;

     b. Violations of a law, treaty, executive order, negotiated labor
     agreement;

     c. Civil rights protections;

     d. Impacts to national consistency (i.e., operational consistency to
     treat people, including the public and DOT employees, equitably);
     and

     e. Degradation of agency mission.

   VII. WAIVER EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW.

   When waivers are approved and tried, the requester and the approving
   official will evaluate the operational effectiveness of the procedure
   permitted by the waiver to determine if it should be expanded,
   extended, discontinued, or a permanent change made to the rule, and
   share the results so that others may learn from their efforts.

   VIII. WAIVER WEBSITE.

   A website has been developed where all Waiver Requests, whether
   approved or disapproved, will be posted for the purposes of sharing
   information and fostering the use of the same or similar waiver(s) in
   other offices/OAs. The website can be accessed through the RSPA Home
   Page.

   Although this process is limited to internal DOT rules, employees are
   encouraged to propose changes to statutes, Governmentwide regulations,
   etc., that they believe inhibit an efficient and effective operational
   environment by consulting with the individual who has responsibility
   for implementation of that statute or regulation.
