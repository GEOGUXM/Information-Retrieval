Health Economics Seminar Series

     The Health Economics Seminar Series was conducted from May 2000-June
     2001. It presented essential information for VA researchers studying
     health economics and cost-effectiveness issues.  Participants
     learned about VA financial databases, how to determine the
     cost-effectiveness of health care interventions, and the methods of
     determining VA health care costs.  Micro-cost methods that were
     covered included direct measurement, use of clinical cost function,
     and pseudo-bill.  The course described how to create average cost
     estimates by combining VA cost and utilization data with non-VA
     relative value units.  It also provided training in the use of the
     Decision Support System (DSS) as a research tool.  Participants were
     encouraged to bring examples and questions from current VA
     projects.

     Currently, we are not conducting any monthly seminar series, but
     please download our seminar presentations. If you'd like to be
     informed of future training opportunities from HERC, please contact
