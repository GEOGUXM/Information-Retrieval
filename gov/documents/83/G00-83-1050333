   Case Studies

   The DQO Process has had many applications at DOE sites across the U.S.
   over the past 10 years. There are many success stories associated with
   these applications. Savings in the millions of dollars in sampling and
   analysis costs have been reported by site operators and their
   regulators. There have been applications in almost every field
   associated with environmental cleanup, including:
     * soil/groundwater characterization and remediation
     * waste characterization and disposal
     * integrated environmental monitoring
     * integrated risk assessments
     * decontamination and decommissioning
     * specific treatment or disposal projects

   The DQO applications reported here are a very small subset of all the
   DQO applications that have taken place at federal facilities as well as
   privately-operated facilities across the U.S. Some of the applications
   reported here are completed, others are in process.

   There was an ongoing program sponsored by DOE (EM-5) to support DQO
   case studies. DOE was willing to fund and cost share in these DQO
   application projects because it believed building an experience base
   across the complex would lead to the wide-spread use of the DQO
   Process. Several DOE contractors have posted results of their DQO
   applications on their web sites (Oak Ridge, Bechtel Hanford).

   We have catalogued the case studies in three ways: 1) alphabetical, 2)
   by geographical location, and 3) by subject area. Each case study is
   listed in all groupings, so you can select the organizational scheme
   you prefer. We encourage sites that have completed DQO case studies to
   share their experiences with us. As appropriate, we will add
   contributed case study write-ups to the list below or link to their
   website.

              Alphabetical | Geographic Location | Subject Area
