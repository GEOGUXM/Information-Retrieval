                              Brief SOF Status

                               [blue_bar.gif]

This page produces a text output with the status of specific processes, disk
  space and last directory updates. The information is parsed from a local
 file, STATUS.OUT which is created via perl scripts running as cron jobs on
  each machine. The last hour's status update (STATUS.OUT.old) is available
                               upon selection.

                                 SELECT ONE:
                     (*) The most recent STATUS file, or
                 ( ) the LAST STATUS update (previous hour)?

                                 Clear Run!
