   How do small-scale processes control large-scale phenomenology, such as
   magnetotail dynamics, plasma entry into the magnetosphere, and substorm
   initiation? Similar processes and questions arise in many other
   astrophysical plasma systems that are far beyond the reach of
   spacecraft.
     * What are the processes that permit and control the reconnection of
       magnetic field lines across collisionless plasma boundaries?
     * How do energy conversion processes accelerate particles at these
       boundaries, and what role do parallel electric fields play?
     * How are electric currents, which connect distant regions of the
       magnetosphere, generated, controlled, and disrupted at boundaries?
     * What is the importance and character of the coupling across scales
       (micro-to mesoscales) in all of these processes?
     * What is the spatial and temporal structure of collisionless shocks?

   Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission Concept:


   MMS Phases 1-3 oval orbits are in the earths eliptical plane MMS Phase
         4 - oval orbit is in the earths ploar plane Diagram of the
             constellation formation arrangements of satellites

   Implementation:
     * 5 identical spacecraft in a variably spaced tetrahedron ( 1 km to
       several R[E] )
     * 4 orbit phases, orbit adjust
     * 2 year in-orbit (minimum) mission life
     * Interspacecraft ranging and communication

   Mission Capabilities:
     * MM will determine the small-scale basic plasma processes which
       transport, accelerate and energize plasmas in thin boundary and
       current layers -- and which control the structure and dynamics of
       the Earth's magnetosphere.
     * MM will for the first time measure the 3D structure and dynamics of
       the key magnetospheric boundary regions, from the subsolar
       magnetopause to the distant tail.
     * MM will pave the way for future Constellation-type missions.

   Magnetospheric Multiscale Technology:
     * MM Mission is possible due to: advances in spacecraft systems
       miniaturization (Integrated Electronics Module, miniaturized
       instruments, etc.) and small satellite manufacturing techniques.
     * Enhancing technologies directly applicable to MM include: advances
       in instrument miniaturization (plasma and E-field measurements),
       data systems (on-board processing, storage, compression), s/c
       attitude, inter-s/c communication, s/c autonomous operation, and
       ground operations.

   Mission Summary:
     * Broad regions of the magnetosphere are connected by fundamental
       processes operating in thin boundary layers. Processes of vastly
       different scale sizes can interact strongly.
     * Understanding these fundamental processes requires multipoint
       measurements that uniquely separate temporal and three-dimensional
       spatial variations. Magnetospheric Multiscale gives us this
       essential capability.
