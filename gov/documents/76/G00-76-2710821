   Space 1 arrives at KSC to prepare for October launch JPL's Deep Space 1
   spacecraft, designed to validate 12 new technologies for scientific
   space missions of the next century, has arrived at Kennedy Space Center
   to begin prelaunch processing. Deep Space 1 will be launched aboard
   Boeing's Delta 7326 rocket and is cur- rently targeted to lift off Oct.
   15. This is the first flight in NASA's New Millennium Program. Among
   the experiments aboard Deep Space 1 is an ion propulsion engine
   strikingly similar to those described in futuristic science fiction
   works, and software that tracks celestial bodies so that the spacecraft
   can make its own navigation decisions without the intervention of
   ground controllers. At launch, the diminutive Deep Space 1 weighs only
   490 kilograms (1,080 pounds) fully fueled and is just 2.5 meters (8.2
   feet) high, 2 meters (6.9 feet) deep and 1.7 meters (5.6 feet) wide,
   including such attached items as twin stowed solar arrays. However,
   when those arrays are deployed, the width will grow to 11.8 meters
   (38.6 feet) across. Deep Space 1 should complete most of its mission
