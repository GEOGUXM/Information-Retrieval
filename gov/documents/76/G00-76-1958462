Beamline 19-ID

   The Structural Biology Center (SBC) operates two X-ray beamlines at the
   ANL Advanced Photon Source (APS).  The APS accelerates charged
   particles (such as electrons) at incredible speeds by using
   high-frequency electrical and low-frequency magnetic fields. The
   radiation emitted by these particles has extremely short wavelengths,
   X-rays. The  X-rays are deflected primarily by the electrons in the
   sample. The dispersed light thus creates a diffraction pattern that can
   be recorded. The diffraction record is much like a topographical map of
   a mountain range. The "dark spots" indicate areas of high electron
   density and can be used to construct a three-dimensional image of the
   structure. The parallel, monochromatic beamlines of the APS are 10,000
   times more brilliant than the average second-generation synchrotron
   radiation sources. This brightness results in more details being
   perceivable much more quickly than previously possible.

   The APS is a national user facility open to all qualified
   crystallographers.  For further information, see also
