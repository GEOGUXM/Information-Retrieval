     Federal Inter-Agency Training Council

     The Federal Inter-Agency Training Council (FIATC) was established
     and spearheaded by the Department of Energy (DOE), Albuquerque
     Operations Office (AL), in September 1996 to develop strategies
     aimed at sharing training resources within the Federal community.
     The Council is composed of approximately 40 Federal agencies in the
     Albuquerque/Santa Fe area and serves as a clearinghouse of training
     information and services, promoting the sharing and partnering of
     training resources among Federal agencies.

     The training partnerships instituted among Federal agencies have
     proven to be extremely beneficial and cost-effective, for all the
     participating Federal agencies. These agencies include the U. S. Air
     Force, Department of Interior, Defense Special Weapons Agency, U. S.
     Army Corp of Engineers, Federal Aviation Administration, etc. A
     mailing list of participating Federal agencies is available.

     The FIATC Steering Committee, established in October 1997, consists
     of eight different Federal agencies and meets bi-monthly to plan
     Council policy and training initiatives. FIATC Quarterly Meetings
     are open to all Federal agencies to discuss current training
     projects and share available training resources.

     The FIATC Steering Committee identified four major goals for FY
     2000:
     * Improve and Expand Cost Avoidance Tracking.
     * Increase Upfront Sharing of Training and Course Development Costs
       between FIATC Agencies to include and increase TSL Learning
       Activities.
     * Improve and Expand Use of Website/Homepage (Establish FIATC
       Homepage).
     * Sponsor Professional Training for FIATC Members (Training
       Community).

     The FIATC has generated significant cost avoidance for participating
     Federal agencies through its training and partnering initiatives
     instituted by the Council. The following is the cost avoidance
     generated:
     * FY 1997 Cost Avoidance: $146,584
     * FY 1998 Cost Avoidance: $290,175
     * FY 1999 Cost Avoidance: $253,416
     * Total Cost Avoidance: $690,175

     FIATC Meetings are Held at the Department of Energy Training Complex

     The Energy Training Complex (ETC) is located on Kirtland Air Force
     Base-West in Albuquerque, NM. The ETC has fifteen training/meeting
     rooms and the capability to sponsor multi-faceted training and
     development and to host large conferences and meetings. The ETC is
     managed by the DOE-AL, Qualification and Training Division, and is
     available to participating FIATC members. Through shared and
     centralized training, reduced travel costs, and savings in facility
     rental fees, we have been able to more efficiently utilize the
     Federal governmentÂ’s training resources.
