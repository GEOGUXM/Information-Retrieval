   PRESENT POSITION

   Head, Space Physics Data Facility (Code 632)
   NASA'S Goddard Space Flight Center

   RESEARCH AND PROGRAMMATIC INTERESTS:

   As a research physicist, I have specialized in basic research in the
   sources, acceleration and propagation of energetic particles in the
   heliosphere. My research has included work on the observational
   characterization and physical modeling of low energy solar and
   interplanetary particles; modeling and observations of lunar particle
   shadows, including the mapping of large scale magnetospheric electric
   fields from these shadows; the mapping of lunar surface remnant
   magnetic fields from the reflection of incident energetic electrons; a
   major study of the elemental composition in large solar energetic
   particle (SEP) events; studies on the characteristic spectra of SEPs;
   studies on the composition and spectra of particles in corotating
   energetic nucleon streams; work on the characteristics of the energetic
   particle populations near Uranus. I am Principal Investigator of the
   IMP-8 Goddard Medium Energy Experiment, and Co-I on a current Wind
   Guest Investigator study.

   Programmatically, I presently manage and direct programs of the Space
   Physics Data Facility, including:

     ISTP and IACG coordinated science data support;
     Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop (CDAW) program;
     Satellite Situation Center (SSC) development and operation; and
     NSSDC space physics data acquisition.

   I am also the code 600 representative to the GSFC IT Federation Board.

   EDUCATION:

   1976 - Ph.D. in Physics, University of California, Berkeley.
   1970 - A.B. in Mathematics and Physics (Honors), University of
   California, Berkeley.
