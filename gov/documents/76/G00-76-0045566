   This area of the library contains images that have accompanied press
   releases written by the media section of NSF's Office of Legislative
   and Public Affairs (OLPA) when they appeared on the OLPA Web site. In
   some cases, a high resolution (300 dpi) version of an image is
   available for reproduction by professional news media directly from
   OLPA. In other cases, a high resolution image may be obtained from the
   institution that produced the original. OLPA does not employ a
   photographer or a graphic artist and generally relies on grantees to
   provide photographs and other graphics that accompany releases.

   NSF does not hold the copyright to these images and permission to use
   them in any form, other than by the media for the purposes of
   disseminating news stories, must be obtained from the institution to
   which they belong.
