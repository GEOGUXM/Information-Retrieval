   FILE: HEATED.PRT REVISED: 03 JANUARY 1996 Heated Calpastatin Activity
   Determination 1. Mince 10 g of lean muscle and homogenize in 30.0 mL of
   postrigor extraction buffer (100 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA; pH 8.3 + the
   inhibitors:100 mg/ml ovomucoid, 6 mg/liter leupeptin,immediately before
   homogenization add 2 mM PMSF.Homogenize for 30 S on high in a small
   metal waring blendor with a 30 S rest, repeat 3 X's 2. Centrifuge for 2
   hours at 35,000 X g (JA-17; 16,500 rpm). 3. Dialyze overnight against
   40 mmM Tris, 0.5 mM EDTA.(1X -MCE.) Do not filter before dialysis. 4.
   Transfer the supernatant into 2 X 35 ml centrifuge tubes. Place the
   tubes in the water bath (preheated to 95_C) check temp of sample every
   5 min until it is up to 95, stirring sample. Heat for 15 min. Then
   chill in ice water bath for 15 min. During chilling, scramble the
   coagulated protein with a small glass rod. This will help to separate
   the supernate and pellet during centrifugation. 5. Spin as above for 30
   min. 6. Measure volume of sample with a 10 mL pipet directly from the
   centrifuge tube, filtering it through a glass wool plug into 50 mL
   conical tubes. 7. Assay supernatant at 100-500 uL in 100 uL increments
   for the Calcium assay. Use 1.0 mL of sample for EDTA assay. 8. Assay
   conditions: -Use 1X elution buffer to bring sample volume up to 1 mL
   -Add sample in appropriate dilutions -Add m-calpain (should have an
   A278 reading of .35- .40 in as little volume as possible. i.e. 10 uL)
   -Add 1.0 mL Assay media (100mM Tris, 1mM NaN3, 7mg/mL
   Casein-Hammerstein, 10 mM MCE, pH 7.5) -Add 100 uL 100 mM CaCl2 or 200
   mM EDTA -Vortex and incubate for 1 hour in a 25 C water bath -Stop
   reaction with 2.0 mL of fresh 5% trichloroacetic acid -Centrifuge for
   30 min. at 1000 x g -Read activity of supernatant at A278 9. To
   determine units of activity/gram: [m-calpain - (calpastatin-EDTA)]x
   dilution factor x volume of supernatant/10(sample size) Reference:
