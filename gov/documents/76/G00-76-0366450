   The term "Special Emphasis Programs" (SEP) refers to those programs
   which focus special attention on certain specific groups as a result of
   a particular law, regulation, and/or Executive Order. Special Emphasis
   programs have been initiated to address the employment-related concerns
   of groups not specifically included in other programs where a need for
   special emphasis or employment concerns of such groups have been
   demonstrated.
