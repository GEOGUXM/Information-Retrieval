   Directory of Organizations
   The NIDCD Directory lists organizations that are national in scope and
   that focus on health issues relating to hearing, balance, smell, taste,
   voice, speech, and language. These organizations may offer additional
   materials such as fact sheets, newsletters, and other informational
   services related to voice, speech, and language.

   Health Information Database Search
   The Deafness and Communication Disorders Database is one of 16
   databases that have joined together to create a health information
   resource called the Combined Health Information Database, or CHID. The
   databases that make up CHID are sponsored by Federal health institutes
   and agencies. We have a list of prepared searches for you on this site,
   or you can perform your own search. When you use CHID, you can search
   all 16 subfiles, or you can search the Deafness and Communication
   Disorders (DC) subfile individually. Bookmark this page, or use your
   browser's back button to return to the NIDCD Information Clearinghouse
   web site after visiting CHID Online.
   About Voice [uparrow.gif]
   [voice_b.gif] Voice is generated by airflow from the lungs as the vocal
   folds are brought close together. The vocal folds vibrate when air is
   pushed past them with sufficient pressure. Without normal vibration of
   the vocal folds in the larynx (voice box), the sound of speech is
   absent. To produce a whisper, the vocal folds need to be partially
   separated. It is estimated that 7.5 million people in the United States
   have difficulties using their voice. Disorders of the voice involve
   difficulties with pitch, loudness, and quality. Many people who have
   acquired normal speaking skills become communicatively impaired when
   their vocal apparatus fails. This can occur if the nerves controlling
   the functions of the larynx are impaired as a result of an accident, a
   surgical procedure, or a viral infection.

   About Speech [uparrow.gif]
   [speech_b.gif] Speech is produced by precisely coordinated muscle
   actions in the head, neck, chest, and abdomen. Speech development is a
   gradual process that requires years of practice. During speech
   development, the child learns how to regulate these muscles to produce
   intelligible speech. It is estimated that by the first grade, five
   percent of children have noticeable speech disorders, the majority of
   which have no known cause. Speech disorders may accompany mental
   retardation, emotional or psychiatric disorders, and a number of
   developmental disorders. One category of speech disorder is fluency
   disorder, or stuttering, which is characterized by a disruption in the
   flow of speech. It includes repetitions of speech sounds, hesitations
   before and during speaking, and/or prolongations of speech sounds.
   There are over 15 million individuals who stutter in the world, most of
   whom began stuttering at a very early age.

   About Language [uparrow.gif]
   [lang_b.gif] Language is the expression of human communication through
   which knowledge, belief, and behavior can be experienced, explained,
   and shared. It is estimated that between six and eight million
   individuals in the United States have some form of language impairment.
   Disorders of language affect children and adults differently. For
   children who do not use language normally from birth, or who acquire
   the impairment in childhood, the disorder occurs in the context of a
   language system that is not fully developed or acquired. Many children
   who are deaf in the United States use a natural sign language, American
   Sign Language (ASL). ASL shares an underlying organization with spoken
   language and has its own syntax and grammar. Many adults acquire
   disorders of language because of stroke, head injury, dementia, or
   brain tumors. Language disorders are also found in adults who have
   failed to develop normal language because of childhood autism, hearing
   impairment, or other congenital or acquired disorders of brain
   development.
