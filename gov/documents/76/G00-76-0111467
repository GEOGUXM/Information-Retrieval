                        Why Did We Create This Web Site?
        _____________________________________________________________

     Federal downsizing is in full swing and will be with us for the
     foreseeable future. Nearly all Federal agencies are undergoing
     significant changes to their missions and functions. Agency budgets
     and staffing levels have been significantly reduced with more cuts
     to come. The newspapers report that cuts sustained to date reflect
     the easy decisions. The more difficult decisions are coming soon and
     many agencies may be forced to conduct Reductions In Force (RIFs)
     over the next several years.

     As civil servants we are being asked by the President, the Congress
     and the American people to continue to do more with less. In human
     terms, that means that we see many of our long- time friends and
     colleagues retiring or leaving to take other jobs. Their jobs go
     unfilled and we are asked to take up the slack. Promotional
     opportunities vanish as senior jobs vacate and are eliminated. We
     all wonder if our own jobs are secure. And our friends and neighbors
     in the private sector appear unsympathetic because they have been
     going through the same for several years.

     Many of us assumed that we would spend our entire careers in Federal
     service. But over the next few years, many of us are facing a future
     where we will no longer be working for the government. THE AUTHORS
     OF THIS WEB SITE BELIEVE THAT OUR INDIVIDUAL FUTURES ARE VERY MUCH
     IN OUR CONTROL. AS INDIVIDUALS WE WILL EACH NEED TO CHOOSE HOW WE
     WILL FACE AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE. OUR GOAL IS TO GIVE YOU--OUR
     COLLEAGUES--THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO MAKE THE CHOICES THAT ARE
     BEST FOR YOU.

     On this site we will explore what happens during a Reduction In
     Force, how to assess your chances during a major RIF, and what your
     rights are if you are adversely affected. We also know that faced
     with major career changes that many of you will want to know what
     your retirement options are. Many of you will want to look for other
     jobs. Fortunately, there is a wealth of information on the Internet
     concerning all of these topics. If we do our job right on the web
     site we will be bringing together the information you need to be
     proactive in planning your future. To do that job right, we need
     your help.

     We believe that the value of this site to Federal employees is
     dependent upon your feedback, advice, ideas and requests. Your
     comments and requests are not only welcome, they are essential. We
     will be using your ideas to continually improve this site and,
     hopefully, make it more valuable to you, our Federal colleagues. We
     also hope to elicit articles and advice from our viewers to be
     incorporated into a series of discussion area called "BEEN THERE.
     DONE THAT."
