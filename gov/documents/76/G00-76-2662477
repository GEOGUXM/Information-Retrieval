   Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) Program Office

   UEET was formed at the NASA Glenn Research Center to manage an
   important National propulsion program for NASA. The Glenn-managed UEET
   Program, which began on October 1, 1999, includes participation from
   three other NASA centers (Ames, Goddard, and Langley), as well as five
   engine companies (GE Aircraft Engines, Pratt and Whitney, Honeywell,
   Allison/Rolls Royce, and Williams International) and two airplane
   manufacturers (Boeing and Lockheed Martin).

   The seven Technology Area projects that make up the UEET Program are
   briefly described below.

   Propulsion Systems Integration and Assessment Propulsion Systems
   Integration and Assessment takes the component technologies being
   developed in the other projects and integrates them into total
   conceptual systems and assesses those systems' potential for meeting
   the UEET Program goals. These assessments will also provide overall
   Program guidance and identify technology shortfalls. The Propulsion
   Systems Integration and Assessment Project has three key Subprojects,
   which include Propulsion System Evaluation, Environmental Impact
   Assessment and High Fidelity System Simulation.

   Emissions Reduction The Emissions Reduction Project will work with the
   U.S. aeropropulsion industry to develop combustion technologies to
   significantly reduce NOx emissions with no increase in other emission
   constituents (carbon monoxide, smoke, and unburned hydrocarbons) and
   with comparable NOx reduction during cruise operations. As in the past,
   new combustor concepts and technologies will be required to produce
   cleaner burning combustors to offset the increased NOx produced by the
   future more fuel efficient engines with higher pressure ratios and
   temperatures. These new combustion concepts and technologies will
   include lean burning combustors with advanced controls and new high
   temperature ceramic matrix composite material with reduce cooling air.
   Low emissions combustor concepts will be developed and evaluated to
   achieve major reductions in NOx emissions for both large and regional
   engines.

   Highly Loaded Turbomachinery The Highly Loaded Turbomachinery Project
   of the UEET program will provide revolutionary turbomachinery
   technologies for increased performance and efficiency. The technologies
   developed will be applicable to a wide range of applications, both in
   terms of flight speed and size class. This project will develop
   turbomachinery technologies for lighter-weight, reduced-stage cores,
   low-pressure (LP) spools, and propulsors for high-performing,
   highly-efficient, and environmentally-compatible propulsion systems.
   Specifically, concepts for significantly increased aero loading,
   trailing edge wake control, and higher cooling effectiveness will be
   developed and demonstrated through proof-of-concept tests. Fan
   technology development will reduce weight and increase efficiency while
   satisfying noise constraints.

   Materials and Structures for High Performance The Materials and
   Structures for High Performance project will develop and demonstrate
   advanced high temperature materials to enable high-performance, high
   efficiency, and environmentally compatible propulsion systems.
   Technologies developed in this project include ceramic matrix composite
   (CMC) combustor liners and turbine vanes, advanced disk alloys, turbine
   airfoil material systems, high temperature polymer matrix composites
   (PMC), and innovative lightweight materials and structures for static
   engine structures.

   Propulsion-Airframe Integration The Propulsion-Airframe Integration
   (PAI) Project of the UEET Program will develop advanced technologies to
   yield lower drag propulsion system integration with the airframe for a
   wide range of vehicle classes. Decreasing drag improves air vehicle
   performance and efficiency, which reduces fuel burn to accomplish a
   particular mission -- thereby reducing the CO2 emissions. PAI can be
   defined as the determination of optimum nacelle placement and optimum
   shaping to both the nacelle and the airframe to minimize drag. This
   objective is accomplished through both computational and experimental
   methods.

   Intelligent Propulsion Controls The rapid explosion of information
   technologies (IT) makes it possible to envision future autonomous
   propulsion system designs which allow the control system to,
   independent of pilot interaction, maximize performance across the
   particular mission profile while at the same time minimize
   environmental impact. Such a control system could also adjust system
   characteristics so as to maximize individual component life and,
   therefore, improve propulsion system life and safety. Currently, the
   overall Intelligent Propulsion Controls (IPC) Project is being planned
   with the challenge to find the proper integration of information,
   propulsion and integrated flight propulsion control technologies. The
   initial efforts will focus on (1) performing systems assessments of the
   projected payoffs of various technologies and (2) performing
   experimental and analytical evaluations of active combustion control
   approaches to support the program goal for landing/takeoff NOx
   reduction.

   Integrated Component Technology Demonstrations Technology demonstration
   tests are a critical step in the technology development process. The
   Integrated Component Technology Demonstrations (ICTD) Project tests
   will provide a significant amount of risk reduction by demonstrating
   that the technologies are still viable when integrated into an overall
   system. The results of these tests provide the necessary confidence to
   the aeropropulsion industry to incorporate the technologies in
   follow-on product insertion programs. The initial efforts in this
   project will focus on determining the most attractive, cost-effective
   approaches to conducting the needed tests. Many potential opportunities
   exist for NASA and DOD to collaborate on the ICTD tests through
   partnership efforts between the UEET and Integrated High Performance
   Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) programs. In addition, potential
   partnership efforts with the U.S. aeropropulsion industry are being
   evaluated. In all cases, it is most desirable to make maximum use of
   existing engine hardware to allow for the most cost-effective tests.
