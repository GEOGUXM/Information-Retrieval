   DATA ACCESS

   The barotropic model output, sampled along the Topex/Poseidon track,
   and read software, are available at our ftp site

   Last cycle available: 281
   Temporal extent: Sep 23, 1992 - May 09, 2000

   The starting times corresponding to each TOPEX cycle are found in our
   Table of Cycle Start Times.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   DATASET OVERVIEW TOPEX/Poseidon
     * This dataset is organized along the Topex/Poseidon tracks, at the
       latitude-longitudes of our nominal 'grid', just as our residuals.
       It includes the following parameters:

     * TIME2: time of each point, for pass j, position i along the pass.
     * RES: sea level residual in mm.
     * IB: inverted barometer from the T/P GDR, in mm. This value is
       derived from ECMWF pressure.
     * BM: Barotropic Model 'sea level', in 0.1 mm, at same time-lat-lon
       as res. Details below.
     * BMIB: Barotropic Model - IB in 0.1 mm. Because the model was forced
       with NCEP wind and pressure, this IB is not the same as the field
       'IB', from ECWMF.
     * HFBM: High Frequency part of BM, in 0.1 mm. Details below.
     * HFBMIB: High Frequency part of (Full Model - IB) in 0.1 mm

     All quantities have had their 1993-1996 time-average removed.

     The Along-track grid has fixed locations for all cycles, 6.2 km
   spacing along-track. The lat-lons (also (3127, 254), but independent of
   time) are in a separate file, latlon.dat.

     The values of TIME2, RES and IB are exactly the same as those in the
   alongtrack residuals dataset (as are the lat-lon values).

     For details on the barotropic model itself, see the description
   below.

   KNOWN PROBLEMS

   For residuals problems, look here.
   The barotropic model version used here has masked out the
   Mediterranean, Black and Caspian seas, where the T/P data is otherwise
   good, and all shallow waters (Patagonian shelf, Grand Banks, etc).
   Special tuning is needed to get those regions performing better than
   inverted barometer alone.

   The wind stress is derived from 1000 mbar, not 10 m wind. In our
   experiments, this conversion matched T/P data better than when 10 m
   winds were used, even though it is not defensible on first principles,
   and the Kondo stress parameterization is for 10 m wind.

   DATA FORMAT

   Units, Data Type, Array Dimensions
     * TIME2(integer*4 time2(3127,254)): time of each point. time2(i,j)
       corresponds to pass number j, position i along the pass. In seconds
       past Jan 1, 1992.
     * RES (integer*2 res(3127,254)): sea level residual in mm.
       (res(i,j)=32767 is a missing value flag; the normal range for res
       is -1500 to +1500 mm)
     * IB (integer*2 ib(3127,254)): inverted barometer from the T/P GDR,
       in mm. This value is derived from ECMWF pressure.
     * BM (integer*2 bm_res(3127,254)): Barotropic Model 'sea level', in
       0.1 mm, at same time-lat-lon as res.
     * BMIB (integer*2 bm_res(3127,254)): Barotropic Model - IB in 0.1 mm.
       Because the model was forced with NCEP wind and pressure, this IB
       is not the same as the field 'IB', from ECWMF.
     * HFBM (integer*2 bm_res(3127,254)): High Frequency part of BM, in
       0.1 mm.
     * HFBMIB (integer*2 bm_res(3127,254)): High Frequency part of (Full
       Model - IB) in 0.1 mm

   Special Values
   Value set to 32767 where data does not exist or has been edited out
   Residual values have 10,000 mm added in shallow water
     * To use deep data only, exclude values h: abs(h) > 1500
     * To use shallow also, if(abs(h) .gt. 1500 AND h .lt. 32767)
       h=h-10000

   Data Organization
   Each file corresponds to one cycle of exactly 3127x254 points. Each
   group of 3127 consecutive points corresponds to one 'pass'. There are
   254 passes in a cycle. Each file contains equator crossing time, the
   relative time (in sec) of of each 1 sec sample, and the sea level
   residual in mm. Latitude and longitude values (3127x254, in degrees)
   are in a separate file, common to all cycles.

   MODEL DESCRIPTION

   The residuals themselves are described here.

   Barotropic Model BT-PHA-1.0

   * Code:
   - Barotropic model of Ponte (1993, 1997, 1999),
   as modified by Hirose et al (2000):
   * subsurface no-slip condition
   * topography from ETOPO5 (1.125 averages) over the unmasked oceans
   * optimized friction parameter, -bu/H, b=2 cm/s
   * Resolution: 1.125째 x 1.125째

   - Coverage/landmask: global, 75째S to 65째N, EXCEPT it does NOT
   include Mediterranean sea, North Sea, Sea of Japan, smaller
   enclosed seas and bays, or waters shallower than 1000m (such
   as the Patagonian shelf, Indonesian Sea, Hudson Bay, etc)

   * Forcing:
   - Atmospheric pressure and 1000 mbar winds, from NCEP Reanalysis, NCAR
   dataset DS090, http://dss.ucar.edu/datasets/ds090.0/ . These forcing
   files are issued every 6 hrs.
   - The 1000 mbar wind is converted to wind stress using the Kondo (1975)
   coefficient.
   - Both the pressure and wind components are time-filtered: at each grid
   point a
   two-pass 4-point (24 hr) average is applied, to remove effect of
   atmospheric
   thermal tides.

   * Inputs required:
   - 6-hourly grids of atmospheric pressure, north wind stress, east wind
   stress.
   - time-invariant bathymetric grid
   - time-invariant land-mask grid
   - parameters file, includes time step, days to integrate, westernmost
   longitude, southernomost latitude; flags on whether or not to write
   grids and how often, whether to smooth in time and how much, Rayleigh
   friction coeff (cm/s), Newtonian damping coeff (days).
   - optional: topex sea level file. If the corresponding option is on,
   this file
   is read, the model is sampled at Topex time-lat-lon on-the-fly, and an
   output file is generated for later statistical summary.

   * Outputs:
   - 1-hourly grids of output model sea level, sea level-IB
   - 1-hourly grids of output water velocity (optional)

   * Filtering:
   - a 2-pass, 20-day bin average is applied to the 1-hour grids at each
   lat-lon node, then substracted from them, to produce the
   'high-frequency' values.
