      Operation and maintenance costs for gages in the streamgaging network
      operated by the USGS in Colorado are funded through:
       1. The USGS Cooperative Water Program via cost-share agreements
          between State, regional, or local agencies and the USGS (about 67%
          of the networks cost in FY01 was funded this way); six of the
          seven stations discontinued in FY2002 were funded in this way.
       2. Total reimbursement agreements with other federal agencies (22%);
          one of the seven stations discontinued in FY2002 was funded in this
          way, and,
       3. Allocations from USGS headquarters of funds appropriated by
          Congress specifically for support of USGS data-collection
          activities (11%).

      These agreements (with 60 cooperating agencies) and allocations are
      made on a year-to-year basis. Because agency priorities and/or
      availability of funds change from year to year, it is typical in any
      given year that funding is discontinued for one or more gages in the
      USGS-operated network.

      The USGS is committed to alerting the States water-resources community
      of the impending loss of funding for operation of gages as soon as
      those situations become known. As of September 28, 2001, we are aware
      that funding from cooperating agencies will not be available in FY2002
      (beginning October 1, 2001) for seven gages currently operated on the
      western slope by the USGS in Colorado.

      Any stakeholders who are particularly concerned about the loss of these
      gages are encouraged to contact the USGS to discuss that concern.
