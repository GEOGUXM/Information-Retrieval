                                          Sharing Climate Data over the Internet

                          Try out these operational servers
     * NVODS (National Virtual Oceanographic Data System)
     * PMEL (Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory)
     * PFEL (Pacific Fisheries Environmental Laboratory)

   The Live Access Server (LAS) is a highly configurable Web server
   designed to provide flexible access to geo-referenced scientific data.
   It can present distributed data sets as a unified virtual data base
   through the use of DODS networking. Ferret is the default visualization
   application used by LAS, though other applications (Matlab, IDL, GrADS,
   ...) can also be used.

   LAS enables the Web user to
     * visualize data with on-the-fly graphics
     * request custom subsets of variables in a choice of file formats
     * access background reference material about the data (metadata)
     * compare (difference) variables from distributed locations

   LAS enables the data provider to
     * unify access to multiple types of data in a single interface
     * create thematic data servers from distributed data sources
     * offer derived products on the fly
     * remedy metadata inadequacies (poorly self-describing data)
     * offer unique products (e.g. visualization styles specialized for
       the data)

   How do I obtain LAS?
          See the Downloads section.

   Where do I get help using LAS?
          Help is available through a users email list, the email list
          archives, and answers to frequently asked questions.

   Who is using LAS?
          Table of LAS sites. We also maintain a separate illustrative
          table showcasing current and planned features of LAS.

   Who should use LAS?
          LAS is a resource for anyone who needs to share oceanographic or
          atmospheric data with others. It is especially well-suited to
          groups of data producers with related data sets at distributed
          locations: a community modeling effort for example.

   Can I configure LAS to meet special needs?
          LAS is configurable with respect to the structure of data sets;
          the style of output graphics; the appearance of the interface;
          the level of user access provided (who can request what); and
          security (who can access the server).

   What systems does LAS run on?
          The server portion of LAS is written in perl and should run on
          any Ferret supported Unix / linux platform. The user interface
          requires java and javascript. A table describes the OS/browser
          combinations it has been tried on.
