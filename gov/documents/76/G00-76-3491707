     Information Infrastructure for the Simulation of Building Performance Under
     Normal and Adverse Conditions

     Principal Investigator: Kent A. Reed   Revised:

       __________________________________________________________________

     Objective:

     To develop standard building information models that facilitate the
     simulation of building system behavior during adverse events.

     Problem:

     Simulation-based programs are excellent tools for assessing and
     mitigating the loss of life and property during terrorist acts against
     buildings, but their development and use is hindered by the high cost
     of gathering the large volume of highly detailed building information
     needed for a robust and valid simulation. This non-value-added process
     is labor intensive, error prone, and requires analysts skilled both in
     simulation and in building technology. The cost of the information
     gathering grows disproportionately as simulation capabilities grow.
     Every simulation has its own information requirements. Typically, new
     information has to be gathered each time a new type of simulation is
     conducted, and the differing information requirements make it difficult
     to mix and match simulations to analyze synergistic phenomena.
     Today, simulations are used mainly during the design of a building when
     the needed information is most readily available. Even in design, a
     complete simulation is typically performed at most once as a check of
     the principal design decisions. The information gathered during design
     isnt maintained as the building ages and evolves because currently the
     cost of information maintenance is even higher than the cost of
     surveying the building when necessary. Unfortunately, the information
     needed becomes harder to find with the passage of time, and guesses are
     often substituted for facts. Then, with the emergence of each new kind
     of threat or of each new kind of analysis methodology, the building
     survey must be done again if simulation tools are to be used.
     The development of standard building information models addresses these
     problems in three complementary ways. They are the basis for (1)
     industry-standard building information repositories that can be
     created, maintained, and used cost-effectively over time; (2) standard
     application program interfaces that enable many different programs to
     access these repositories and to interoperate with each other; and (3)
     standard information interchange protocols for use in communications.
     Concomitant with the need to develop standard information models is the
     need to develop simulation models, prediction tools, and protocols that
     can feed from the building information repository and improve building
     monitoring, performance prediction, control, and communication during a
     terrorist attack. One such parallel development of application
     technology is being pursued in a sister project [02-863-6115]. Standard
     information models establish the framework that allows application
     technologies to be applied in a cost-effective manner to real
     buildings, but the technologies themselves must be developed to work
     together with the models if owners, occupants, and emergency responders
     are to benefit. In its turn, the development of these application
     technologies directly drives the formulation of the information models
     in areas that are largely untouched in current standardization
     activities.

     Approach:

     In FY 2002, the NIST-developed CONTAMW will be used as an exemplar
     simulation program, and the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) being
     developed by the International Alliance for Interoperability will be
     explored as the basis for a candidate standard building information
     model. The information requirements for CONTAMW will be determined.
     Classes in release 2.x of the IFC will be identified to meet these
     requirements and documented as one or more conformance classes. A
     preliminary mapping between IFC-based information and CONTAMW data will
     be developed and implemented first in the form of an IFC-based file
     translator and then as an application program interface to an IFC-based
     building information repository. A model of the NIST Administration
     Building (or a similar building) will be created in an object-oriented
     3D Computer Aided Design system and translated into IFC-based data sets
     for use in demonstrations of these interfaces. In following years, this
     project will be expanded to address other NIST simulation programs, the
     impact of new simulation technologies on standard building information
     models, and the processes necessary to create and maintain an
     extensible whole-building information repository over the useful life
     of a building.
