   Background top

   The Deep Space Network (DSN) was established in 1958 and since then it
   has evolved into the largest and most sensitive scientific
   telecommunications and radio navigation network in the world. The
   purpose of the DSN is to support unpiloted interplanetary spacecraft
   missions and support radio and radar astronomy observations in the
   exploration of the solar system and the universe. DANS is a automated
   system for scheduling and resource allocation for antenna and subsystem
   resources in the DSN. DANS works from an initial schedule and uses
   prioritized pre-emption and localized search to find antenna and other
   equipment resources required to support changes to schedule
   requirements which may be caused by a wide range of circumstances
   including: changing track requirements from the flight projects,
   equipment outages, and inclement weather.

   AI Technology top
     * Artificial Intelligence techniques: temporal constraint networks,
       knowledge-based tactics.
     * Operation Research techniques: Scheduling dispatch rules, heuristic
       search.
     * Metaobject Protocol design.
     * Object Library of commonly-used resource and job types.
     * Advanced human machine interface design.


   Problem top
     * The number of projects using the 26, 34 and 70 meter subnetwork is
       increasing.
     * The current scheduling process is negotiation-based and is
       therefore expensive, time-consiming, and doesn't necessarily result
       in the ``best'' schedule.
     * As the loading increases the complexity of scheduling exponentially
       increases.
     * The current manual scheduling process will become prohibitively
       expensive (basd on predicted future demand for support).
     * The DSN is not reimbursed for representing the projects in the
       scheduling negotiations.


   Impact top

   Based on the success of the project work on OMP, this system will have
   great potential to further reduce human interaction and increase DSN
   productivity on all its antenna.

   Status top

   The system is under development and will be delivered in 1998.

   Description top

   The objective of this task is to provide automated, reactive schedule
   generation and rescheduling capabilities to support 26, 34 and 70 meter
   antennas scheduling and Real Time scheduling operations for JPL's Deep
   Space Network (DSN).

   Significance top
     * Generates a conflict-free schedule from the projects' generic
       requests.
     * Performs automated schedule maintenance.
     * Greatly reduces the need for schedule negotiation meetings.


   More Information top

   Features:
     * Table-driven inputs, e.g., Resources, Projects, Activity Types,
       Requests.
     * GUI interface to display schedule and resource conflicts.
     * Uses AI and OR techniques to autonomously produce a schedule.
     * Minimally perturbs an existing schedule to accommodate new tasks.
     * Adjusts the schedule to match the most recent generated view
       periods.
