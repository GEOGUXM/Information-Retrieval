                           Message from the Bureau
   Since September 11, the need to create a more peaceful, prosperous and
   secure global environment has assumed even greater urgency than before.
       The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs promotes mutual
   understanding, respect and long-term linkages between the people of the
     United States and other countries through academic and professional
   exchanges and cultural programs worldwide. We invite you to learn more
     about the Bureau's programs and to join with us in working towards
                                these goals.

      The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) fosters mutual
      understanding between the United States and other countries through
      international educational and training programs. The bureau does so by
      promoting personal, professional, and institutional ties between
      private citizens and organizations in the United States and abroad, as
      well as by presenting U.S. history, society, art and culture in all of
      its diversity to overseas audiences.
