   Definition The Federal Register (FR) is a government document
   containing regulations and legal notices issued by Federal agencies and
   the President. It is produced by the Office of the Federal Register,
   and published every Federal working day.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Background Many laws enacted by Congress require agencies to issue
   regulations. All regulations must be published in the FR because it is
   the official document used to notify the public, and Federal and State
   agencies of recent government actions.

   At the beginning of each document, a heading provides the name of the
   issuing agency, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) title and parts
   affected, and a brief description of the subject covered within the
   document. In some cases, the agency will include the docket number,
   which identifies the document within the agency's internal filing
   system.

   The preamble, which follows the heading, explains the basis and purpose
   of the regulatory text. This section must accompany the regulatory text
   of all final or proposed rules.

   Actions published in the FR are grouped by Presidential Documents or by
   agencies. Within each agency, actions are further separated into one of
   the following categories: (1) rules and regulations, (2) proposed
   rules, (3) notices, or (4) meetings.

   Presidential Documents Presidential documents in the FR are separated
   into the following categories: proclamations and executive orders,
   letters, memorandums, and reorganization plans.

   Presidential proclamations are of two types: (1) ceremonial,
   designating periods of special observance, or (2) substantive, usually
   dealing with trade. Most proclamations address the general public, and
   may or may not have a legal effect.

   Executive orders may cover a variety of topics, and are generally
   directed toward executive agencies. These documents are issued both as
   a means of implementing the President's constitutional and statutory
   responsibilities, and as a means of managing the operations of the
   executive branch of the government.

   Presidential documents are compiled annually under Title 3 of the CFR.

   Rules and Regulations
   (Separated by Department) The rules and regulations section contains
   final, legally binding, regulatory documents. Documents are listed
   under the Federal agency that has regulatory authority (i.e., Energy
   Department, etc.). Eventually, most of these regulations will be
   codified in the CFR (usually within one year from the date of
   publication in the FR).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Proposed Rules
   (Separated by Department) A proposed rule is an announcement to the
   public that a change to the CFR is under consideration. The purpose of
   publishing proposed rules is to enable interested persons to
   participate in the rule making process by submitting comments prior to
   adoption of the final rule.

   Most proposed rules suggest changes to agency regulations in the CFR
   and request public comment on those suggested changes. Many agencies
   voluntarily publish proposed changes for the expressed purpose of
   soliciting comments.

   The heading and preamble format are the same for both proposed and
   final rules. Within the preamble for proposed rules, an address and
   deadline date are generally provided for submission of comments.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Notices
   (Separated by Department) The notices section contains documents other
   than rules or proposed rules that may be of interest to the public.
   Documents in this section are not codified in the CFR, and may include
   any of the following: (1) notices of hearings and investigation, (2)
   committee meetings, (3) agency decisions and rulings, (4) delegations
   of authority, (5) filing of petitions and applications, (6) issuance or
   revocation of licenses, (7) grant application deadlines, and (8)
   availability of environmental impact statements.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Meetings
   (Separated by Department) Prior to March 1, 1996, the final category of
   documents appearing in the FR were announcements of upcoming meetings
   within the Federal government. Meeting announcements must be published
   in accordance with the Sunshine Act (5 USC 552b(e)(3)). However, as of
   March 1, 1996, all meeting announcements are to be incorporated into
   the Notices section of the FR.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Tip The terms "rules" and "regulations" are used interchangeably
   throughout the FR.

   Each meeting notice is numbered, and a table of contents arranged by
   agency name and item number appears at the beginning of the section.

   Searches in the Federal Register database can be defined by one or more
   of the following: (1) subject, (2) location, (3) agency, (4) issue
   volume or number, or (5) action. You will perform the most effective
   searches if you highlight all three Federal Register boxes. Also, this
   database archives previous issues (which are indicated by [ ]s), so you
   may retrieve entries further back than last months issue.

   For example, if you performed a search air radiation, you would
   retrieve any entries that contained either "air" or "radiation", or
   both. As illustrated in this example, it is not necessary to include
   words such as AND, OR or NOT because they will be deleted by the
   filtering process of the search engine. Additionally, quotations may be
   used if you are interested in retrieving a specific phrase (i.e.,
   "Environmental Impact Statement").
