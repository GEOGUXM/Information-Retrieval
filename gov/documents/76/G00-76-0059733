    How NASA Studies Air

    NASA missions collect data that tells us more about the composition,
   behavior, and quality of our air. Using that data, scientists develop
   or refine their theories about climate and its effects. They try to
   determine which long-term variations in climate result from natural
   causes and which are caused by people.

   They monitor the ozone layer to detect changes, and they try to
   determine the causes and their impact on the planet. To test their
   theories, they send up new missions. They share what they learn, so we
   can benefit from weather prediction and understand how we affect the
   air quality and how it affects us.

   Over the next 15 years, an international program called EOS will
   monitor climate and environmental change on Earth. The leading
   satellite in this program is called Terra. From Terra will come data
   for new research about how Earth's lands, oceans, air, ice, and life
   function as a total environmental system

   Terra, the Earth Observing System flagship, is flying above your head
   right now! This satellite is studying many things, including
   "Airspray", aerosols that cause global cooling!

   Visit the Exploratorium's Ozone graphing activity to use actual
   satellite data in your own "ozone hole" investigations.

   [air_pressure.gif] Air Pressure
   The force exerted on you and things around you by the weight of tiny
   particles of air (air molecules) is called air pressure. Although air
   molecules are invisible, they still have weight and take up space. Air
   pressure makes it possible to fly in airplanes and keeps our bodies
   from exploding! Find out how air pressure affects you and why it's
   important.
