Status Graphics

Availability of USGS Geospatial Data and
Aerial Photography Products
     __________________________________________________________________

   The links below will lead customers to online status graphics, or
   map-based images, depicting the current availability of selected USGS
   Digital Cartographic Data and Aerial Photography products. Due to the
   complex nature of the information provided on these graphics, the file
   sizes may be relatively large. Consequently, downloading such files
   from the Internet to computers via modem for viewing may take several
   minutes. When viewing these images, please be aware that the physical
   dimensions of these images were chosen to provide maximum legibility,
   at minimum file size, on a typical computer monitor. Some legends may
   be difficult to read on lower resolution monitors. Larger map images
   may not fit within the confines of smaller monitors, nor will they be
   printed in their entirety on most printers.

   Customers wishing to obtain versions of any of the status graphics that
   faithfully reproduce the look of the original images, and which can be
   saved for later viewing and printing, may do so by downloading the
   graphics in the Portable Document Format (PDF) format via the links
   provided. To view and print the PDF versions of these graphics,
   customers must obtain and install the AcrobatÂ® Reader, available at no
   charge from Adobe Systems, Inc.

   A list of definitions of terms used to describe product status is
   provided for reference.
