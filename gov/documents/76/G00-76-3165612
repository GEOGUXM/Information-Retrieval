      The Implementation and Evaluation of Clinical Practice Guidelines

   The Research Coordinating Center for SCI QUERI at the Edward Hines, Jr.
   VA is taking part in an evaluation subcontract for the study, A
   National Program Initiative to Evaluate Spinal Cord Medicine Clinical
   Practice Guidelines (New Program Initiatives 98-009), originated at the
   James A. Haley VAMC.

   The goal of this project is to enhance the quality, appropriateness,
   effectiveness, and efficiency of care delivered to SCI veterans through
   the implementation of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) at VA SCI
   Centers. Specific aims of this study include: 1) identifying barriers
   and facilitators to the implementation of two CPGs, Prevention of
   Thromboembolism in SCI and Neurogenic Bowel Management in Adults with
   Spinal Cord Injury, 2) evaluating the effectiveness of the
   dissemination and implementation of clinical practice guidelines, 3)
   describing the process of implementation, and 3) examining associated
   health care utilization and costs.

   The two evidence-based CPGs were developed by the Consortium for Spinal
   Cord Medicine and sponsored and supported by the Paralyzed Veterans of
   America (PVA). The impact of these two CPGs will be evaluated at six VA
   SCI Centers. Data will be collected retrospectively and prospectively
   over three periods of time: 1) pre-publication of guidelines, 2)
   pre-implementation of guidelines, and 3) post-implementation of
   guidelines. Data collection strategies include medical record reviews,
   extraction from administrative databases, process logs. In addition,
   patient and provider surveys will be used to measure attitudes,
   knowledge, and satisfaction.

   In May 1999, the SCI QUERI Executive Committee recommended that the
   current study be enlarged to include enhanced patient outcome measures.
   The addition of an outcomes assessment component has since been planned
   and is awaiting funding. Additional clinical outcomes have been
   identified and methods of obtaining this data through chart abstraction
   and administrative databases have been explored.

   The effective use of CPGs is thought to improve the process and
   outcomes of health care, decrease practice variation, and optimize
   resource utilization. A number of questions exist about how to best
   implement guidelines and whether different guidelines, treatment
   settings, and patient populations require different implementation
   strategies.

   Overall, the objective of this study is to determine the effect of
   implementing CPGs on patient outcomes and the impact on SCI veterans'
   quality of life. It is hoped that insights gained from this study can
   be used to guide future decision making for clinical practice
   guidelines, including effective ways to evaluate the guidelines, the
   appropriateness of implementation, and the most effective methods of
   dissemination.
