                     Welcome to the FCSC Kid´s Corner!

     The Florida Caribbean Science Center is excited to introduce a new
              section of our website intended for young people.
   Check out short movie clips of amphibians, educational movies on coral
   reef research, games & puzzles, wildlife pictures, and more.  There are
    Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) throughout the site on a variety of
   topics.  Occasionally, you may be directed outside of this site to our
   other Science Center sites.  Feel free to explore these sites, as there
   is something interesting for all ages.  When you wish to return to the
  Kid´s Corner, click the "Back" button on you browser, or use the site´s
    navigational aids.  You´ll need a few free "plugins" to get started.
           Ask your parents to download them from the sites below.
   We have had some fun designing these pages with a wilder flare and hope
    you enjoy your visit ... and please get your parents to email us with
                        your thoughts on our website.

                     Important information for Parents:
   This website is best viewed with 4x+ browsers, and the font size set to
                small or medium. Click here for instructions.
