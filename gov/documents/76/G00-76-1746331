   The primary criterion used by the CIDR Access Committee (CAC) is the
   likelihood that the proposed project will successfully map the trait.
   Since projects granted access to CIDR may exceed the genotyping
   capabilities of the Center, the CAC will prioritize the successful
   projects. In reaching these decisions, the Committee will evaluate each
   of the following:
     * Approximate number of samples and whether the project requires a
       whole genome screen by a large capacity genotyping facility
     * Quality and completeness of phenotyping
     * Significance and complexity of the disorder/trait
     * Strength of the evidence for a genetic component to the disease
       phenotype
     * Ability of the investigator to manage the large amount of data that
       is generated by large genotyping projects
     * Appropriateness of proposed analytic methods and the ability of the
       investigator to apply them
     * Appropriateness of the study population for the specific disease
       mapping project and availability of adequate numbers of subjects
     * Plans for follow up studies if linkage is found
