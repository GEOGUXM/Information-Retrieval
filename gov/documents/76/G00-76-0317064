   Massive black holes are thought to power most active galactic nuclei.
   The highest resolution images of the regions surrounding these black
   holes are made using VLBI. In some objects, orbital speeds within a
   light year of the black hole can thus be measured to "weigh" the black
   hole. In many other objects, the relativistic jets of plasma powered by
   the black hole are imaged in the central light year, helping determine
   the physics of the accretion onto the black hole. Only VLBI can image
   these regions; space VLBI missions such as ARISE will give yet higher
   resolution, probing ever closer to the most extreme power sources in
   the universe.

   VLBA observations show a disk of dense material is orbiting within the
   nucleus of the NGC 4258 galaxy at velocities up to 650 miles per
   second. The Very Long Baseline Array allowed precise measurements of
   the rotation of the material in the disk, which provides some of the
   most direct and definitive evidence to date for the presence of a
   supermassive black hole in the center of another galaxy.
