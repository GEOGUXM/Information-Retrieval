   Today's U.S. microelectronics and supporting infrastructure industries
   are in fierce international competition to design and produce new
   smaller, lighter, faster, more functional, and more reliable
   electronics products more quickly and economically than ever before. A

   Recognizing this trend, in 1994 the NIST Materials Science and
   Engineering Laboratory (MSEL) began working very closely with the U.S.
   semiconductor, component and packaging, and assembly industries. These
   early efforts led to the development of an interdivisional MSEL program
   committed to addressing industry's most pressing materials measurement
   and standards issues central to the development and utilization of
   advanced materials and material processes within new product
   technologies, as outlined within leading industry roadmaps1. The vision
   that accompanies this program - to be the key resource within the
   Federal Government for materials metrology development for commercial
   microelectronics manufacturing - may be realized through the following
   objectives:

   bullet develop and deliver standard measurements and data;
   bullet develop and apply in situ measurements on materials and material
   assemblies having micrometer- and submicrometer-scale dimensions;
   bullet quantify and document the divergence of material properties from
   their bulk values as dimensions are reduced and interfaces contribute
   strongly to properties;
   bullet develop fundamental understanding of materials needed in future
   microelectronics
