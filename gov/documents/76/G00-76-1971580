NIST Cherry Road CD Incorporated into Command School Curriculum

     Command School is a three day training symposium sponsored by the
     International Association of Fire Chiefs for fire department
     officers. The objective of the course is to improve fire incident
     command strategies to reduce firefighter deaths. The Command School
     instructors developed a presentation utilizing the BFRL produced
     CD-ROM, Simulation of the Dynamics of the fire at 3146 Cherry Road
     NE, Washington, D.C., May 30, 1999, NISTIR 6510. Two NIST models,
     the Fire Dynamics Simulator and Smokeview, were used to simulate a
     townhouse fire that claimed the lives of two Washington D.C.
     firefighters. Approximately 2,000 fire officers attend Command
     School each year. Through support from the U.S. Fire Administration,
     each student will receive a copy of NISTIR 6510 on CD-ROM.

  Virtual Cement and Concrete Testing Laboratory Consortium Reviews Progress

     The goal of the Virtual Cement and Concrete Testing Laboratory, an
     industry-NIST consortium, is to improve modeling software so that
     much of the routine testing of cement and concrete can be
     eliminated, thus enabling the multi-variable, materials
     science-based, optimizaton of concrete. The second meeting to review
     technical progress of the VCCTL consortium was held in Monterrey,
     Mexico, at the headquarters of Cemex corporation. Three NIST
     researchers from BFRL, Dale Bentz, Clarissa Ferraris, and Edward
     Garboczi, attended, along with representatives from Dyckerhoff
     Cement, Cemex, the Portland Cement Association, and Holcim Cement.
     Attending via video link were representatives from Cemex
     (Switzerland), MBT (Switzerland), W.R. Grace (Boston), and NIST (ITL
     and MSEL, Gaithersburg). The meeting reviewed the technical
     accomplishments of the first year, which were favorably received by
     the industrial members. Research plans for the next six months were
     formulated, which reflect an increasing amount of collaboration. For
