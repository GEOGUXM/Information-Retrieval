   ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS

      The administrative actions PHS/HHS may take against respondents who
      have a finding of research misconduct made against them include, but
      are not limited to:
        * debarment from eligibility to receive Federal funds for grants and
          contracts,
        * prohibition from service on PHS advisory committees, peer review
          committees, or as consultants,
        * certification of information sources by respondent that is
          forwarded by institution,
        * certification of data by institution, imposition of supervision on
          the respondent by the institution,
        * submission of a correction of a published article by respondent,
          and
        * submission of a retraction of a published articles by respondent.

      Which administrative actions, the number of administrative actions, and
      the length of the administrative actions depends on the seriousness of
      the misconduct, the impact of the misconduct, and whether the
      misconduct demonstrates a pattern of behavior. Administrative actions
      are usually imposed for 3 years, but have ranged from 1 to 10 years.
      ORI generally relies on the cooperation of the institution where the
      respondent is currently employed to assist in implementing
      administrative actions.
