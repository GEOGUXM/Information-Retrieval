                               Introduction to
                        NANOSCIENCE & NANOTECHNOLOGY
                       AT SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES

   Atom-Tracker STM,
   which has the capability of
   following an individual atom
   as it moves across a
   crystal surface.

   It's no wonder that venturing into the tiny domain of atoms and
   molecules is catching on. Amazing discoveries are being made, inspiring
   scientists the world over.
   Throughout the scientific community, including Sandia National
   Laboratories, researchers say building things atom-by-atom or
   molecule-by-molecule will revolutionize the production of virtually
   every human-made object. Exciting prospects--but they also point out
   the promise of nanotechnology can only be realized if we learn to
   understand the special rules that control behavior at this small scale
   and develop the skill needed to integrate these concepts into practical
   devices.

   The excitement stems from the understanding that the behavior of
   materials at the nanoscale is nothing like that at the large scale.
   Only recently have the necessary tools, such as powerful new
   microscopes, been developed to let researchers see these surprising
   behaviors. Sandia National Labs' scientists and engineers are among the
   leading architects and builders of these tools. To appreciate their
   unique design features, it helps to get an idea of the size of things
   at the atomic level. In nanoscience objects are measured in nanometers,
   1 billionth of a meter. For comparison, the smallest features on
   current computer chips, measure about 200 nanometers. And a human hair
   is 100,000 nanometers thick.

   Moving beyond observation, scientists are now poised to make exciting
   advances in nanotechnology, the creation of materials, devices and
   systems through the control of matter at the atomic level. By
   understanding and controlling the way molecules organize into nanoscale
   patterns, scientists are discovering new phenomena and learning to
   design materials with vastly different sets of properties. As one
   Sandia scientist put it "Design possibilities are limited only by one's
   imagination."

   Sandia Labs continues to enhance its proficiency in many fields, all in
   keeping with its Department of Energy mission to unite science and
   engineering to serve national needs. And along with world class
   capabilities in materials science, micro fabrication - including 40,000
   square feet of clean room space - high performance computing and
   systems engineering - Sandia is uniquely positioned to be the
   integrating center for new discoveries in nanoscience.

   to discover and understand the way
   matter behaves at the nanoscale.
