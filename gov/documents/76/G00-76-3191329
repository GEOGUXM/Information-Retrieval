   Services provided:

       lease, letter of agreement, permit, interagency agreement, license,
       MOA, etc. (See the Lease Requirements Questionnaires )

     * Preparation of audit related documentation, including capital and
       operating lease spreadsheets
     * Fee simple acquisitions
     * Liaison with GSA for real property disposal actions and
       GSA-controlled space

   We are responsible for over 1 million square feet of leased space with
   a total annual rent of approximately $9.8M, owned space with a value of
   $40.4M+ in acquisition costs, and 3,500+ acres of land.

   The Facilities Program Manager serves as the Project Manager for two
   major construction projects, the Tallahassee and Key West WFO leases.

   Our database manager, Sheryl Thomasson, maintains RSMIS, the Real
   Estate Management and Information System database, which gives us the
   capability to provide real estate data to the line offices as
   requested. The new Federal Real Property Management system will replace
   RSMIS in FY 01, and has the potential for direct access to the database
   by line offices.
