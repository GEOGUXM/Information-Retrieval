   Aerogel Quick Facts

     * It is 99.8% Air
     * Provides 39 times more insulating than the best fiberglass
       insulation
     * Is 1,000 times less dense than glass
     * Was used on the Mars Pathfinder rover

   Catching Comet Dust

   Particle Captured in Aerogel
   The primary objective of the Stardust mission is to capture both
   cometary samples and interstellar dust. Main challenges to
   accomplishing this successfully involve slowing down the particles from
   their high velocity with minimal heating or other effects that would
   cause their physical alteration. When the Stardust Spacecraft
   encounters the Comet Wild 2, the impact velocity of the particles will
   be up to 6 times the speed of a rifle bullet. Although the captured
   particles will each be smaller than a grain of sand, high-speed capture
   could alter their shape and chemical composition - or even vaporize
   them entirely.

   To collect particles without damaging them, Stardust uses an
   extraordinary substance called aerogel. This is a silicon-based solid
   with a porous, sponge-like structure in which 99.8 percent of the
   volume is empty space. By comparison, aerogel is 1,000 times less dense
   than glass, which is another silicon-based solid. When a particle hits
   the aerogel, it buries itself in the material, creating a carrot-shaped
   track up to 200 times its own length. This slows it down and brings the
   sample to a relatively gradual stop. Since aerogel is mostly
   transparent - with a distinctive smoky blue cast - scientists will use
   these tracks to find the tiny particles.

   Aerogel Capabilities

   Aerogel is not like conventional foams, but is a special porous
   material with extreme microporosity on a micron scale. It is composed
   of individual features only a few nanometers in size. These are linked
   in a highly porous dendritic-like structure.

   This exotic substance has many unusual properties, such as low thermal
   conductivity, refractive index and sound speed - in addition to its
   exceptional ability to capture fast moving dust. Aerogel is made by
   high temperature and pressure-critical-point drying of a gel composed
   of colloidal silica structural units filled with solvents. Aerogel was
   prepared and flight qualified at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
   JPL also produced aerogel for the Mars Pathfinder and Stardust
   missions, which possesses well-controlled properties and purity. This
   particular JPL-made silica aerogel approaches the density of air. It is
   strong and easily survives launch and space environments. JPL aerogel
   capture experiments have flown previously and been recovered on Shuttle
   flights, Spacelab II and Eureca.

   "Tennis Racket" Shaped Collector

   Aerogel Dust Collector
     Under Construction

   The aerogel aboard the Stardust Spacecraft is fitted into a "tennis
   racket" shaped collector. This is unfolded from the protective Sample
   Return Capsule to expose it to space during flight. One side of the
   collector will be faced towards the particles in Comet Wild 2, while
   the reverse, or B side, will be turned to face the streams of
   interstellar dust encountered during its journey.

   When hypervelocity particles are captured in aerogel they produce
   narrow cone-shaped tracks that are hollow, and can easily be seen in
   the highly transparent aerogel by using a stereomicroscope. This cone
   is largest at the point of entry, and the particle is held intact at
   the point of the cone. This provides a method for determining which
   direction the dust came from, and is the basis of the approach of using
   single slabs of aerogel to collect both cometary and interstellar dust
   from both sides.

   After the encounter with Comet Wild 2, the aerogel collector will be
   retracted into the Sample Return Capsule (SRC) and returned to Earth
   for detailed analysis by scientists at the NASAs Johnson Space Center.
