   The Board of Trustees is the legislative body of government in the
   Village of Burr Ridge, and is composed of six Trustees. The Board of
   Trustees adopts an annual budget for all operations of the Village as
   well as a tax levy ordinance which determines the amount of money to be
   raised each year by property taxes. In general, the Board establishes
   polices and oversees all Village services.
   The Village President, the chief executive officer of the Village,
   chairs the meetings of the Board of Trustees. However, the Village
   President does not vote except in the case of a tie vote of the Board
   and in certain other cases which require greater than a simple
   majority.
   The Trustees and the Village President are elected from the Village at
   large to serve four year terms. Elections are held every two years. The
   Trustees do not receive salaries for their service; however, the
   Village President does receive $100 per month.
   The bi-monthly meetings of the President and Board of Trustees are open
   to the public. Time is reserved in the meetings for citizens' questions
   and/or comments. Meetings are videotaped and are broadcast at 6 p.m.
   the following day on Cable Channel 6.
   The Village Clerk, who serves as clerk to the Board of Trustees, is
   also elected from the Village at large for a four year term. The main
   duties of the Clerk are to maintain the official records of the
   Village, attesting to the Village President's signature on documents;
   serve as clerk to the Board of Trustees, and act as deputy registrar of
   voters. In the absence of the Village Clerk, a Deputy Clerk is
   appointed to serve as an assistant and as a deputy registrar.
