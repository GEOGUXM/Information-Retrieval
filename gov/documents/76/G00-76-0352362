   News Letter Nr 1 FUSION EUROPE 14 November 2001 _____ EUROPEAN
   PARLIAMENT BACKS FUSION Today, the European Parliament, Strasbourg,
   voted a 100 MEuros increase in the fusion budget in Framework Programme
   6, following a last minute drama. Mrs Ahern called the FP6 fusion
   proposals outdated, as Japan and USA had pulled out. Mrs McNally, PES
   Coordinator previously obtained a free vote. (The vote was unrecorded).
   Personally she felt ITER wouldn't happen, extra money would materialize
   later. Mr Seppanen (GUE) demanded more fusion money; Switzerland,
   Canada, Japan involved; ITER must not be delayed. Mrs RÃ¼hl (Greens)
   stated that too much money was spent on fusion. Mr Linkohr (PES) didn't
   accept fusion was a too distant prospect - at least give the next
   generation the choice. Mr Trakatellis (GUE) was glad that fusion was
   supported addressing long-term needs. Commissioner Busquin said
   flexibility on the ITER 200 MEuros possible; welcomed "fast track" ITER
   and materials to 2020, but doesn't support global FP6 budget increase
   to 17.6 billion Research Council decides on 12 December. Published by
