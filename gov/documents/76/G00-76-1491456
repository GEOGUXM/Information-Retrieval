      The Caribbean District of U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has been
      developing a spatial GIS database for Puerto Rico since 1988. The
      establishment of this GIS has been facilitated by cooperation with many
      Puerto Rico government agencies. The first phase of this major task
      began in 1988 and was completed in 1990. It encompassed the conversion
      of all USGS topographic quadrangles (1:20,000) of Puerto Rico to a
      digital line graph format (DLG).  Layers of topography, hydrography,
      transportation, and political boundaries have been digitized during
      this phase and are now in use.

      These digital spatial data layers satisfy the National Mapping Division
      standards for accuracy. The GIS was enhanced with the digitization of
      soils maps produced by the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS,
      formerly Soil Conservation Service) and compiled by quadrangle by the
      Puerto Rico Department of Natural & Environmental Resources (PRDNER),
      and land use maps produced by PRDNER from 1977 aerial photography.
      Other layers have been added to the system such as the Ground Water
      Site Inventory (GWSI), surface water stations, horizontal and vertical
      control points, and flood areas documented by USGS studies.
