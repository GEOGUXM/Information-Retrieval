                        Instrument Incubator Program

                         NASA RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENTS

Proposals Selected Under NRA-98-OES-05

   NASA's Office of Earth Sciences has begun a new program to develop and
   demonstrate new measurement technologies through ground-based
   laboratory activities. The Instrument Incubator Program (IIP) will
   reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of Earth-observing
   instruments and enable new Earth-observation measurements.

   "This new program is intended to bring together technological
   capabilities of academia, industry and government to enable NASA's
   Earth Sciences enterprise to accomplish its scientific and applications
   objectives," said Dr. Ghassem Asrar, Associate Administrator for Earth
   Sciences, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC. "Through this program we
   intend to introduce technological innovations into the science and
   applications programs more frequently and reduce development time and
   risk, lowering the cost of future missions."

   NASA received 123 proposals of which 27 have been selected. Selected
   projects include three from industry, six from NASA field centers,
   eight from universities and ten from national laboratories. The dollar
   value of the first round of IIP awards is approximately $20 million.
   Areas for instrument development within the program include land-cover
   and land-use change and global productivity research;
   seasonal-to-interannual climate variability and prediction; natural
   hazards research and applications; and long-term climate observations
   -- natural variability and change research, and atmospheric ozone
   research.

   The IIP will enable members of the scientific community to propose,
   build and launch new Earth Science payloads within a three to four-year
   period. By focusing on a short turnaround time, NASA hopes to minimize
   cost while encouraging creative new designs for Earth Science
   instruments. This program represents the first time that the Earth
   Sciences enterprise has solicited technology proposals, establishing a
   benchmark for future solicitations.
