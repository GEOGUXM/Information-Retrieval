  ABSTRACT

   In January 1999, the U.S. Geological Survey collected estuarine-water,
   estuarine-sediment, surface-water, and ground-water quality samples in
   the vicinity of Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Camden County, Georgia.
   Data from these samples are used by the U.S. Navy to monitor the impact
   of submarine base activities on local water resources. Estuarine water
   and sediment data were collected from five sites on the Crooked River,
   Kings Bay, and Cumberland Sound. Surface-water data were collected from
   seven streams that discharge from Naval Submarine Base, Kings Bay.
   Ground-water data were collected from six ground-water monitoring wells
   completed in the water-table zone of the surficial aquifer at Naval
   Submarine Base Kings Bay. Samples were analyzed for nutrients, total
   and dissolved trace metals, total and dissolved organic carbon, oil and
   grease, total organic halogens, biological and chemical oxygen demand,
   and total and fecal coliform.

   Trace metals in ground and surface waters did not exceed U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency Drinking Water Standards; and trace
   metals in surface water also did not exceed U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency Surface Water Standards. These trace metals included
   arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, selenium,
   silver, tin, and zinc. Barium was detected in relatively high
   concentrations in ground water (concentrations ranged from 18 to 264
   micrograms per liter). Two estuarine water samples exceeded the Georgia
   Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division
   standards for copper (concentrations of 6.2 and 3.0 micrograms per
   liter).
