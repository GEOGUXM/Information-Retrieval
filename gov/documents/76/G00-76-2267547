   U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientist Frank Chapelle and his
   colleagues from the USGS and the University of Massachusetts have
   discovered a potential analog for life on other planets. The scientists
   discovered a unique community of microscopic organisms known as Archaea
   thriving deep in the subsurface source of a hot spring in Idaho.
   Archaea, a class of microscopic organisms that were once thought to be
   bacteria, are unique because unlike most life on Earth that relies on
   oxygen to breathe and organic carbon as a food source (such as decaying
   plants), Archaea live on a diet of hydrogen and carbon dioxide.
   Therefore, scientists think Archaea-type microorganisms could exist in
   worlds without organic carbon, such as Mars or Europa. Archaea are
   prevalent in Earth's subsurface where oxygen does not exist but are
   usually found in small numbers compared to more competitive bacteria.
   For example, the microorganisms (methanogens) that degrade contaminants
   at chemical and oil spills and produce methane are Archaea. This is the
   first documented case of a microbial community completely dominated by
   Archaea -- no other known life form could exist under such harsh
   conditions.

   The methods that were developed to study the fluids and microorganisms,
   including Archaea, in the hot spring area are presently being used by
   the USGS Toxic Substances Hydrology Program to study the biodegradation
   of a chlorinated solvent spill in fractured rock at the Naval Air
   Warfare Center (NAWC) Research Site, West Trenton, NJ. These methods
   will enable site managers to understand how microbial populations adapt
   to chemical stresses, and thus how these microbes contribute to the
   detoxification of pollutants. The results of this investigation of the
   microorganisms (Archaea and bacteria) at the NAWC Site will one day
   lead to the development of subsurface contaminant cleanup technology
   that exploits the power of these unique microorganisms.
