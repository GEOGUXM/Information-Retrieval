   Opportunities in Information Technology They used to call us nerds . .
   . Now they call us very wealthy nerds. Well. . . many of us. We are the
   vanguard. More than any other group, we will decide how you will live
   tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. Consider the changes in your life
   over the past ten years: how you (or your parents) work, bank, shop,
   travel, get health care, have fun, communicate with friends, get
   information, learn new things. We have transformed every one of these
