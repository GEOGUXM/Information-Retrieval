                     2001 STAR RESULTS: EASTIN ANNOUNCES
                   CONTINUED GAINS IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT

          SACRAMENTO-For the third straight year, test results for the
     2001 Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) program show overall
     gains in student achievement in English-language arts and
     mathematics.

          "Overall, scores are up, and that's good news; however, the
     performance on the new California Standards Tests reveals that we
     still have much work to do to achieve world-class results," said
     State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin.

          Scores on the standards-based tests in language arts show that
     only 30 percent of students are meeting these new rigorous goals.

          Results of the 2001 STAR program, including data by school,
     district, county and state, may be accessed through the California
     Department of Education Web site:

                           http://star.cde.ca.gov

          In spring 2001, nearly 4.5 million California public school
     students in second through eleventh grades took the reading,
     mathematics, written expression, and spelling sections as required
     by law. This year, the STAR program featured the Stanford
     Achievement Test, Ninth Edition, Form T (Stanford 9), published by
     Harcourt Educational Measurement; the California Standards Tests,
     produced for California public schools; and the Spanish Assessment
     of Basic Education, Second Edition (SABE/2).

          On the Stanford 9, the norm-referenced test that has been
     administered to California students for the fourth consecutive year,
     scores continue to rise. In reading, scores in the lower grades,
     where statewide reforms have been focused, have risen the most in
     the last three years, with scores in second grade rising 11 percent,
     in third grade by 8 percent and in fourth grade by 7 percent.

          In mathematics, the STAR results showed that student
     performance gains have been impressive over the past three years.
     Gains continue to be largest in the lower grades, slowing in middle
     school, and slowing somewhat more at the high school level. Gains
     over the three years are 15 percent or higher in the second through
     fourth grades, average 10 percent in the fifth through eighth
     grades, and average 4 percent at the high school level.

          "As we expected, students who have entered California's
     educational system since standards-based reforms have been adopted
     are doing better. Students in our middle and high schools are moving
     upward, too, but at a slower pace. It is clear that reform at these
     grade levels is our next big challenge," said Eastin.

          "The best news is that students who had the advantage not only
     of our standards but of class-size reduction, are making the most
     dramatic strides," she said. "We are on the right course."
     For the first time, results of the California Standards Tests in
     English-language arts, are being reported in terms of California's
     newly adopted performance levels. Each student receives a score for
     their performance on the test at one of five levels: Advanced,
     Proficient, Basic, Below Basic, or Far Below Basic.

          "The Proficient level has been established as the goal for all
     students, and that is a rigorous and ambitious goal," said Eastin.
     "These first test results reveal that, on average, only 30 percent
     of our students currently are reaching the goal. We must work
     together to provide schools the support they will need so that all
     of our children have the knowledge and skills they will need to lead
     successful lives."

          The 2001 scores will become part of the baseline for the
     Academic Performance Index (API), California's index of school
     achievement, and will be part of the calculation for overall growth
     in school achievement in 2002.

          "This first inclusion of standards-based scores in the API
     signals an important shift in accountability toward the use of the
     California Standards Tests and away from reliance on norm-referenced
     test results. In 2002, our new tests in mathematics, history-social
     science, and science also will report results using performance
     levels, and will then become a part of the baseline for the API. At
     that point, standards-based assessments will be fully represented in
     California's accountability system."

          In addition to the introduction of the standards-based tests in
     history and science this year, California also tested students in
     the fourth and seventh grades with a new writing assessment. Initial
     results from this assessment show that California students have
     difficulty with challenging standards-based writing tasks and that
     much work is needed if students are to express themselves
     effectively. The scores from the writing assessments will become a
     part of the English-language arts portion of the API in 2002.

          STAR reporting also includes valuable information about
     specific groups of students who participate in the STAR program. For
     example, the scores of English learners can be compared to the
     scores for all of California's students. As expected, the scores of
     English learners in English and mathematics are lower than those for
     all students, but English learners, too, have been making
     substantial gains over the last four years. In the early grades,
     where all students have made the greatest gains, English learners
     have also reached higher levels of achievement: in reading, scores
     have increased by 13 percent at the second grade, 8 percent at the
     third grade, and by 6 percent at the fourth grade; in mathematics,
     the gains are 17 percent at the second grade, 19 percent at the
     third grade, and 13 percent at the fourth grade.

          Although scores for English learners and other identified
     groups of students are rising, the gap between groups of students
     remains wide.

          "These results challenge all of us to focus attention where
     this gap is widest, to ensure that we provide all students with a
     standards-based education of the highest quality," said Eastin.

          "When we examine student achievement over the past three years,
     we have to be pleased at the substantial gains we are making.
     California's schools are responding to the challenge," she said.
     "But there is a long way to go. Our standards-based test is just
     coming on line. And while the bar is set at a high level of
     achievement, we must rededicate ourselves to ensure that all
     students reach the goal we have established."

          (*Note: STAR scores for the Long Beach Unified School District
     will not be posted until September 15. The school district is the
     first in the state to utilize a new state law (Senate Bill 245 by
     Sen. Jack O'Connell, D-Santa Barbara) that allows a district to wait
     until 85 percent of the school days in the school year have been
     taught before testing students. A significant number of students in
     Long Beach Unified were tested much later than is typical due to its
     unique academic schedule.)

          (**It also should be noted that state officials remain
     perplexed over the continued drop in reading scores between the
     eighth and ninth grades. This is not only a California testing
     phenomenon but a national one as well and an inconsistency that
     Harcourt Educational Measurement has not fully explained.)
