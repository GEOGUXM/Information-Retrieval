   Answers:

   Q1. What is the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) ?
   The Fair Labor Standards Act is the Federal law which establishes
       minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and child labor
       standards for full-time and part-time workers in the private sector
       and in Federal, State, and local governments.  Some states have
       worker protections which exceeds federal standards.  Check it out
       here.



   Q2. What is the minimum wage?
   The current minimum wage is $5.15 an hour which went into effect on
       September 1, 1997.  The first minimum wage established in 1938 was
       $.25 an hour.



   Q3. What is overtime pay?
   Overtime pay is premium or extra money paid to employees for all hours
       worked over 40 in a workweek.



   Q4. Does the minimum wage and overtime law apply to all workers?
   No.  Most workers in the United States are entitled to a minimum wage
       of not less than $5.15 an hour, and overtime pay at a rate of not
       less than one and one-half times their regular rates of pay is
       required after 40 hours of work in a workweek.  There are some
       workers who are not subject to one or both of these provisions.  As
       an example, workers who have jobs in seasonal and recreational jobs
       like working at a summer amusement park or a swimming pool may be
       exempt from the minimum wage and overtime rules.  The delivery of
       newspapers to customers is also exempt from these rules.



   Q5. When should workers be paid?
   Workers are required to receive their wages on the regular payday for
       the time period worked.



   Q6. How many hours in a workweek can an employee my age be required to
   work?
   There are limits on both the number of hours and the time of day that a
       14- or 15-year old can work.  They may not work during school
       hours.  They may work up to three hours on a school day, eight
       hours on a nonschool day, and 18 hours a week during a school
       week.  They may work no more than forty hours in a week that school
       does not meet.  There are also periods of time which 14- and
       15-year-olds may not work.  They may not work before 7:00 a.m. or
       after 7:00 p.m., except between June 1 and Labor Day when the end
       of day standard is 9:00 p.m.  There is no limit on the number of
       hours in a workweek that an employee at least 16 years of age may
       be required to work.



   Q7. Does the law require workers to be paid for such things as
   vacations, holidays, severance, or sick time?
   No.  Vacations, holidays, severance, or sick time are not required.
       They are fringe benefits which an employer may choose to provide to
       employees.



   Q8. Are employers required to give workers meal, rest or break periods,
   holidays off, sick pay, and health and life insurance coverage under
   the minimum wage law?
   No.  It is up to the employee and the employer to agree on any of these
       things which are called fringe benefits.  Sometimes they are
       offered to full-time workers but not to part-time workers.



   Q9. Should workers receive extra pay for working on weekends and
   holidays?
   No.  The minimum wage law does not require overtime or extra pay for
       work on weekends and holidays.



   Q10. Under the minimum wage law, are employers required to give notices
   or reasons for firing workers?
   No.  The law does not require notices or a reason for firing
       employees.



   Q11. What is the youth minimum wage?  Who may be paid the youth minimum
   wage?
   As a result of the 1996 Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act,
       employers can pay a youth minimum wage of $4.25 an hour to
       employees under 20 years of age during the first 90 consecutive
       calendar days of employment.  For more information about the youth
       minimum wage click here.



   Q12. Who should be contacted if a parent or an older working brother or
   sister or friend has a question about not being paid properly at work?
   These employees should contact the local Wage and Hour Office listed in
       most telephone directories under U.S. Government, Department of
       Labor, Wage and Hour Division.  A list of these local offices is
       also available on the Internet on the Wage and Hour Divisions Home
       Page.



   Q13.  Is there general information available about the minimum wage
   law?  Where can someone obtain this information?

       obtained on the Department of Labor Home Page to review, or from a
       local Wage and Hour Division office.  Click here for the location
