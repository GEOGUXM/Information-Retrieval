                      REMOTE  SENSING  ON-LINE  PROJECT


                             Under Construction

       This page is under construction and will be updated frequently

   This page provides the latest information on the Remote Sensing On-Line
   Project (RSOL)

   The goal of the Remote Sensing On-Line Project (RSOL) is to promote
   Earth Remote Sensing by providing full access to a wide range of
   remotely sensed data, and near real-time remotely sensed data in a
   user-friendly fashion.  The 'user-friendliness' of the site will be
   assured by incorporating tutorials and step-by-step instructions for
   accessing the data and generating data products.  The customers include
   schools (grades 9-12), colleges and universities, and GIS and remote
   sensing researchers.

   The "Strawman" Remote Sensing On-Line Website  has a proposed web page
   format for the actual site

   The Remote Sensing On-Line Resources page contains a listing of relates
   web sites and resources that may be used for the Remote Sensing On-Line
   Project

   The References  page contains useful background information related to
   data acquisition for the Remote Sensing On-Line Project


   Project Plan

   The Remote Sensing On-Line (RSOL) Project will provide remotely sensed
   data, and near real time data, in a user-friendly manner.  This will be
   done by:

   Using existing facilities and infrastructure
     * Code 935 direct broadcast download, processing, and distribution
       facilities
     * Goddard DAAC near real-time data processing and distribution system
     * NASA's Earth Observatory
     * Goddard Education Office Remote Sensing Education and Outreach
       Laboratory (RSEOL)
     * EOS Project "Coolspace" laboratory with remote sensing supplement
     * Remote sensing tutorials and examples
     * Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) web implementation software
     * EOS and remote sensing related web pages and materials
     * Example GIS and remote sensing sites already in existence
     *

   Using a simple but fully capable web-based user interface
     * The user only needs an internet connection and a web browser
     * Web-based data location, manipulation, viewing and downloading
     * Easily "point and click" data location system
     * Default data set is small, but selectable
     * Data sets available from multiple sources
     * Data sets available in multiple formats
     * Simple instructions for "quick start" of novice users
     * On-line instructions and tutorials
     * Links to complete remote sensing tutorials are provided
     * Multi-feature data processing capability at the host (reduce data
       transfer requirements and user software requirements)
     * Multiple format data download options
     * Easy return to selected data for temporal studies
     * Access to large data sets for experienced users
     *

   Project Partners

   The following are the NASA/Goddard individuals or organizations who
   will initially participate in the project:  As the prototype system is
   set up, we will find many more willing to participate.  For a listing
   of potential participants outside Goddard, please see Remote Sensing
   On-Line Resources below.
     * Code 935 (Applied Information Sciences)
     * Code 902 (Goddard DAAC)
     * Code 420 (EOS Project Office)
     * Code 130 (Goddard Education Office)
     * Code 900 (Scientific and Educational Endeavors (SEE))
     * NASA's Earth Observatory
     * Goddard Education Office Remote Sensing Education and Outreach
       Laboratory (RSEOL)
     * NASA  "Coolspace" outreach laboratory
