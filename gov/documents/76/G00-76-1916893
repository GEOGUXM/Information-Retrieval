                    Chapter One: Pretrial Considerations

   1.1 Right to a Jury Trial

   B. Criminal Actions

   1. Criminal Actions

   c. Petty Offense. Insert after citation to 18 U.S.C. ' 1(3): A Where
   the maximum term of imprisonment is six months or less, there is a very
   strong presumption that the offense is petty and defendant is not
   entitled to a jury trial.@ United States v. Ballek , 170 F.3d 871, 876
   (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 318 (1999).

   Insert at the end of the paragraph: Where A a very large fine, or a
   very long period of probation, or the forfeiture of substantial
   property@ is imposed, a petty offense may be converted into a more
   serious offense. United States v. Ballek , 170 F.3d 871, 876 (9th Cir.)
   (restitution did not turn a petty offense into a serious offense),
   cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 318 (1999).

   1.3 Jury Impanelment B Double Jeopardy

   A. Jury Trial

   Insert at the end of the paragraph: A Jeopardy terminates when the jury
   reaches a verdict, or when the trial judge enters a final judgment of
   acquittal. @ United States v. Byrne , 203 F.3d 671, 673 (9th Cir. 1999)
   (citing Fong Foo v. United States , 369 U.S. 141, 143 (1962)).

   B Accepting Jury = s Verdict

   A. Criminal Proceedings

   2. Felony Jury Trials

   required. See United States v. Gomez- Lepe, 207 F.3d 623, 631 (9th Cir.
   2000).
   _______________________________________________________________________

                           Chapter Two: Voir Dire

   2.8 Closed Proceedings Generally [NEW]

   A Though criminal trials are presumptively open to the public, see
   Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596, 605 (1982), a
   court may order closure of a criminal proceeding if those excluded are
   afforded a reasonable opportunity to state their objections and the
   court articulates specific factual findings supporting closure. Such
   findings must establish the following: > (1) closure serves a
   compelling interest; (2) there is a substantial probability that, in
   the absence of closure, this compelling interest would be harmed; and
   (3) there are no alternatives to closure that would adequately protect
   the compelling interest. = Oregonian Publ = g Co. v. United States
   Dist. Court, 920 F.2d 1462, 1466 (9th Cir. 1990). @ Unabom Trial Media
   Coalition v. United States Dist. Court , 183 F.3d 949, 951 (9th Cir.
   1999) (citations omitted).

   2.11 Recurring Voir Dire Problems (renumbered from 2.10)

   A. Civil Voir Dire

   1. Juror Veracity

   Insert after Couglin v. Tailhook Ass = n: See also Pope v. Man- Data,
   Inc., 209 F.3d 1161, 1164 (9th Cir. 2000) (error for district court to
   grant new trial where neither dishonesty nor bias of juror was
   demonstrated, notwithstanding juror's failure to disclose requested
   information regarding litigation and collection action history).

   B. Criminal Voir Dire

   2. Areas to be Covered

   a. Law enforcement officers. Insert at the end of the paragraph: A
   [W]hether a question need be asked about police credibility depends on
   various case-specific circumstances . . . . @ Paine v. City of

   Lompoc , 160 F.3d 562, 565 (9th Cir. 1998) (no error on facts
   presented).

   e. Bias or prejudice based on race. Insert after United States v.
   Rosales: See also United States v. Sarkisian, 197 F.3d 966, 979 (9th
   Cir. 1999) (even assuming A a reasonable possibility that racial or
   ethnic prejudice might have influenced the jury, the district court = s
   questions regarding the defendants = ethnicity, the use of
   interpreters, and the jurors = abilities to serve impartially [] were
   all reasonably sufficient to test the jury for bias and partiality @
   (citation omitted)), cert. denied , 120 S. Ct. 2230 (2000).

   f. Willingness to follow law . Where it appears that a prospective
   juror disagrees with the applicable law, the court should inquire as to
   whether the juror is nevertheless willing to follow the law. See United
   States v. Padilla- Mendoza , 157 F.3d 730, 733 (9th Cir. 1998), cert.
   denied , 119 S. Ct. 1084 (1999).

   g. Supplemental questions . A It is wholly within the judge = s
   discretion to reject supplemental questions proposed by counsel if the
   voir dire is otherwise reasonably sufficient to test the jury for bias
   or partiality.@ Paine v. City of Lompoc , 160 F.3d 562, 564-65 (9th
   Cir. 1998) (quoting United States v. Powell , 932 F.2d 1337, 1340 (9th
   Cir. 1991)).

   4. Jury Panel's View of Defendant in Handcuffs

   [Section omitted.]

   C. Recurring Problems Regarding Shackled or Handcuffed Defendant

   1. Shackling

   A Because visible shackling during trial is so likely to cause a
   defendant prejudice, it is permitted only when justified by an
   essential state interest specific to each trial.@ Rhoden v. Rowland ,
   172 F.3d 633, 636 (9th Cir. 1999) (citing Holbrook v. Flynn , 475 U.S.
   560, 568-69 (1986)).

   2. View of defendant in restraints

   A A jury = s brief or inadvertent glimpse of a defendant in physical
   restraints outside of the courtroom,@ absent actual prejudice, does not
   warrant relief. Rhoden v. Rowland , 172 F.3d 633, 636 (9th Cir. 1999)
   (citations omitted).

   3. Restraints generally

   A [S]hackling, like prison clothes, is an indication of the need to
   separate a defendant from the community at large, creating an inherent
   danger that the jury may form the impression that the defendant is
   dangerous or untrustworthy. Therefore, > [i]n the presence of the jury,
   [the defendant] is ordinarily entitled to be relieved of handcuffs, or
   other unusual restraints, so as not to mark him as an obviously bad man
   or to suggest that the fact of his guilt is a foregone conclusion.= @
   Rhoden v. Rowland, 172 F.3d 633, 636 (9th Cir. 1999) (alteration in
   original) (quoting Stewart v. Corbin, 850 F.2d 492, 497 (9th Cir.
   1988)).

   2.12 Challenges for Cause (renumbered from 2.11)

   B. Erroneous Overruling of Challenge for Cause

   Replace existing text with: If a defendant, by exercising a peremptory
   challenge, cures the erroneous denial of a challenge for cause, the
   defendant has been deprived of no rule-based or constitutional right.
   See United States v. Martinez-Salazar , 120 S. Ct. 774, 777 (2000).
   _______________________________________________________________________

   2.13 Peremptory Challenges (renumbered from 2.12)

   B. Criminal

   1. Number of peremptory challenges

   Insert after chart: The joinder of two or more misdemeanor charges for
   trial does not entitle a defendant to ten peremptory challenges. See
   United States v. Machado , 195 F.3d 454, 457 (9th Cir. 1999).

   2.14 Batson Challenges

   B. Batson Procedure

   1. Three-Step Process

   Insert after Purkett v. Elem: See also Stubbs v. Gomez , 189 F.3d 1099,
   1104 (9th Cir. 1999), petition for cert. filed , U.S. Apr. 18, 2000
   (No. 99-9429).

   5. No specific findings required

   A Neither Batson nor its progeny requires that the trial judge make
   specific findings, beyond ruling on the objection.@ United States v.
   Gillam , 167 F.3d 1273, 1278 (9th Cir.) (citation omitted), cert.
   denied , 120 S. Ct. 235 (1999).

   2.16 Dual Juries [NEW]

   The Ninth Circuit has held that the use of dual juries does not violate
   due process. See Lambright v. Stewart , 191 F.3d 1181, 1186 (9th Cir.
   1999) (en banc) (federal habeas proceeding).
   _______________________________________________________________________

                       Chapter Three: The Trial Phase

   3.8 Successive Cross-Examination

   C. Defendant = s Refusal to Answer Questions on Cross- Examination
   (Criminal)

   Substitute the following for the first paragraph: A When a defendant
   refuses to answer questions on cross-examination, the district court
   may impose one or more of the following sanctions: (1) permit the
   prosecution to comment on the defendant = s unprivileged refusal to
   answer; (2) permit the prosecution to impeach the defendant= s direct
   testimony by continuing to elicit his unprivileged refusal to answer;
   (3) instruct the jury that it may take the defendant = s refusal to
   answer various questions into account when reaching a verdict; and/or
   (4) strike the defendant = s direct testimony. @ United States v. King
   , 200 F.3d 1207, 1217 (9th Cir. 1999) (citation omitted).

   3.11 Tape-recordings B Admissibility of Tape Excerpts and/or Translated
   Transcript [NEW]

   A. Generally

   A A recorded conversation is generally admissible unless the
   unintelligible portions are so substantial that the recording as a
   whole is untrustworthy. @ United States v. Rrapi , 175 F.3d 742, 746
   (9th Cir.) (citations omitted), cert. denied , 120 S. Ct. 261 (1999).

   B. Preferred Procedure Regarding Accuracy of Transcripts

   A Generally, the Court reviews the following steps taken to ensure the
   accuracy of the transcripts: (1) whether the court reviewed the
   transcripts for accuracy, (2) whether defense counsel was allowed to
   highlight alleged inaccuracies and to introduce alternative versions,
   (3) whether the jury was instructed that the tape, rather than the
   transcript, was evidence, and (4) whether the jury was allowed to
   compare the transcript to the tape and hear counsel= s arguments as to
   the meaning of the conversations. @ United States v. Rrapi, 175 F.3d
   742, 746 (9th Cir.) (citation

   omitted), cert. denied , 120 S. Ct. 261 (1999).

   C. Foreign Language Tapes

   Where a foreign language tape has been translated, the general
   requirement that the jury be told that the tape and not the transcript
   are the evidence no longer applied. See United States v. Rrapi , 175
   F.3d 742, 746 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 261 (1999).

   D. Video-Taped Depositions B Immigration Case

   8 U.S.C. ' 1324(d) states: A Notwithstanding any provision of the
   Federal Rules of Evidence, the videotaped (or otherwise audiovisually
   preserved) deposition of a witness to a violation of subsection (a) of
   this section who has been deported or otherwise expelled from the
   United States, or is otherwise unable to testify, may be admitted into
   evidence in an action brought for that violation if the witness was
   available for cross examination and the deposition otherwise complies
   with the Federal Rules of Evidence.@ This statute A simply allows the
   introduction of video- taped testimony > notwithstanding any provision
   of the Federal Rules of Evidence. = @ United States v. Santos-Pinon ,
   146 F.3d 734, 736 (9th Cir. 1998) (by failing to object to the release
   of witnesses, defendant waived any objection regarding the government
   causing witness to be unavailable, as required for use of video-taped
   deposition).

   3.18 Defendant's Right to Testify [NEW] (Insert after Mini- Arguments
   During Trial, renumbered 3.17.)

   Although a defendant = s right to testify is well established, Rock v.
   Arkansas , 483 U.S. 44, 51 (1987), a defendant must assert the right to
   testify before the jury has reached a verdict. See United States v.
   Pino-Noriega , 189 F.3d 1089, 1095-96 (9th Cir.), cert. denied , 120 S.
   Ct. 453 (1999).
   _______________________________________________________________________

   3.19 Closing Argument

   B. Response to Objectionable Closing Argument

   Insert the following as new first paragraph: The district court has a
   duty to dispel prejudice from the government's argument. See United
   States v. Rodrigues, 159 F.3d 439, 450-51 (9th Cir. 1998), amended by
   170 F.3d 881 (9th Cir. 1999) (where district court did not A rebuke @
   government's counsel for A gratuitous attack on the veracity of defense
   counsel, @ district court took inadequate steps to dispel prejudice).

   3.20 Judgment of Acquittal B Jeopardy [NEW]

   The trial court = s oral granting of a motion for judgment of
   acquittal, without an entry of judgment, and subsequent vacating of the
   acquittal, does not violate double jeopardy prohibitions. See United
   States v. Byrne , 203 F.3d 671, 674-75 (9th Cir. 2000).
   _______________________________________________________________________

                        Chapter 5: Jury Deliberations

   5.1 Jury Questions During Deliberations

   F. Requests for Readbacks of Testimony

   1. In General

   Insert at the end of the third paragraph: See also La Crosse v. Kernan,
   211 F.3d 468, 474 (9th Cir. 2000) ( A A criminal defendant has a
   constitutional right to be present during the readback of testimony to
   a jury @ and A must personally waive his right to be present at the
   readback. @ (citations omitted)).

   5.2 Communications with a Deliberating Jury

   E. Ex parte contacts

   Ninth Circuit precedents A distinguish between introduction of >
   extraneous evidence = to the jury, and ex parte contacts with a juror
   that do not include the imparting of any information that might bear on
   the case. @ Sea Hawk Seafoods, Inc. v. Alyeska Pipeline Serv., Co , 206
   F.3d 900, 906 (9th Cir.), petition for cert. filed , U.S. July 14, 2000
   (No. 00-90). A 'Where ex parte contacts are involved, the defendant
   will receive a new trial only if the court finds > actual prejudice to
   the defendant.' @ Id. at 906 (quoting United States v. Maree, 934 F.2d
   196, 201 (9th Cir. 1991)).

   F. Jury Tampering

   A In a criminal case, any . . . tampering, directly or indirectly, with
   a juror during a trial about the matter pending before the jury is, for
   obvious reasons, deemed presumptively prejudicial . . . . @ Remmer v.
   United States , 347 U.S. 227, 229 (1954). See also United States v.
   Dutkel , 192 F.3d 893, 894-95 (9th Cir. 1999) (co- defendant = s
   tampering with jury required reversal of defendant = s convictions
   unless government could show there was no reasonable possibility that
   tampering affected jury's decision as to defendant).

   5.3 Using Less than Twelve Jurors and Seating Alternate Jurors
   (Criminal)

   C. Just Cause to Excuse Juror B Rule 23(b)

   Insert after the third paragraph:

   1. Excusing Deliberating Juror Where Reason is Based on Juror = s View
   of Case

   A [I]f the record evidence discloses any reasonable possibility that
   the impetus for a juror = s dismissal stems from the juror = s views on
   the merits of the case, the court must not dismiss the juror. Under
   such circumstances, the trial judge has only two options: send the jury
   back to continue deliberating or declare a mistrial. @ United States v.
   Symington , 195 F.3d 1080, 1087 (9th Cir. 1999) (emphasis in original).
   See also United States v. Beard, 161 F.3d 1190 (9th Cir. 1998).

   2. Necessity for Evidentiary Hearing

   A An evidentiary hearing is not mandated every time there is an
   allegation of jury misconduct or bias. Rather, in determining whether a
   hearing must be held, the court must consider the content of the
   allegations, the seriousness of the alleged misconduct or bias, and the
   credibility of the source.@ United States v. Angulo , 4 F.3d 843, 847
   (9th Cir. 1993). See also United States v. Hanley , 190 F.3d 1017, 1031
   (9th Cir.1999) (on facts presented, district court did not err in
   refusing to conduct evidentiary hearing regarding whether a juror
   should have been excused).

   5.4 "Allen " Charge

   G. De Facto Allen Charge

   Communications with a deliberating juror by court staff may constitute
   a de facto Allen charge. See Weaver v. Thompson , 197 F.3d 359, 366-67
   (9th Cir. 1999) (bailiff = s communication to deliberating jury that
   jury had to reach a verdict on all counts constituted an impermissible
   de facto Allen charge).

                   Chapter 6: Post Verdict Considerations

   6.3 Post-Verdict Evidentiary Hearing Regarding Extrinsic Evidence

   Insert at the end of the second paragraph: A Rule 606(b) of the Federal
   Rules of Evidence prohibits a juror from testifying about the jury
   deliberations or how the jurors reached their conclusions unless >
   extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury =
   s attention. = @ United States v. 4.0 Acres of Land , 175 F.3d 1133,
   1140 (9th Cir.) (error for district court to grant new trial based on
   juror= s statements to the press regarding the impact of evidence),
   cert. denied , 120 S. Ct. 582 (1999).
