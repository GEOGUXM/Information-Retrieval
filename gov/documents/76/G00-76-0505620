   B.    Law Intern Opportunities

   Opportunities are available in the Computer Crime and Intellectual
       Property Section of
       the U.S. Department of Justice for qualified candidates interested
       in summer law
       internships or academic semester law internships (sometimes called
       "externships").
       Law interns work directly with attorneys on cutting edge legal
       issues relating to
       computer crime and intellectual property crime.  Typical intern
       projects have involved
       researching novel legal issues, drafting litigation documents for
       active cases, analyzing
       policy proposals, and helping to draft Section publications.

       Qualifications:
        • Interns must be enrolled in an accredited law school and must
       have:

     (1)  a strong academic background;
         (2)  excellent research and writing skills;
         (3)   interest in criminal issues; and
         (4)   experience, knowledge, or interest in computers,
       telecommunications
                networks or other emerging  technologies.

      • Summer Interns must have completed at least one year of law
     school and be willing to commit ten to twelve weeks (full-time) to
     CCIPS.  In special circumstances, CCIPS may consider a shorter
     commitment.

      • Semester-based Interns must have completed at least one semester
     of law school and be willing to commit 15-20 hours a week to CCIPS.
     In special circumstances, CCIPS may consider a shorter commitment.
     CCIPS will consider semester "full time" positions from law students
     who attend law schools with formal externship programs.

      • Because of the sensitive nature of the work,  applicants must
     pass a background check before a formal offer for an internship can
     be extended.

      • All internships are unpaid.

     Application Process:

     Applicants must submit a resume, a short or partial writing sample
     (not to exceed 10  pages), three references, and law school
     transcript to address (PLEASE NOTE NEW MAILING ADDRESS):

     U.S. Department of Justice
     10th & Constitution Ave., NW
     Criminal Division, (Computer Crime & Intellectual Property Section)
     John C. Keeney Building, Suite 600
     Washington, DC 20530

     Due to possible mail delays, submission of application materials by
     fax is preferred. Application materials may be faxed to (202)
     514-6113; ATTENTION: Intern Hiring Coordinator.

     Approximate Application Timetable:

      Summer:  Apply by February 1
      Fall/Winter:  Apply by July 1
      Spring:  Apply by November 1

     Because interviews are scheduled on a rolling basis, early
     applications are helpful.
