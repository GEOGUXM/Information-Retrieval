   [about_foley.gif] The Nonproliferation and National Security
   Institute's (NNSI's) primary mission is to efficiently and effectively
   train personnel throughout the DOE complex who are, or may become
   involved in, the protection of vital national resources. NNSI's
   secondary mission is to provide support, within scope, to other DOE
   program and operations offices and to other government agencies.

   NNSI provides necessary training and special services for DOE programs
   that involve nuclear nonproliferation and arms control, emergency
   management, counterintelligence, and nuclear security.

   NNSI's broad umbrella encompasses a rapidly growing number of training
   centers and academies that serve clients as diverse as the Office of
   Security, Emergency Operations, the Office of Counterintelligence, the
   Bureau of Diplomatic Security Services Antiterrorism Assistance
   Program, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation and International
   Cooperation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of
   State Weapons of Mass Destruction Program.
