   DPM Reporting Requirements PSC 272 Quarterly Reports


   DPM Reporting Overview

   PMS recipient reporting requirements are consistent with the OMB
   policies and the standards for government-wide reporting. DPM uses an
   automated PSC-272 as approved by OMB for both paper and ELECTRONIC
   REPORTING. These computer-generated reports are furnished to all
   recipients with active PMS accounts. A PSC 272 and its appropriate
   schedules (PSC 272-A through G) are produced for each recipient (payee)
   account, if applicable. Since payees may have more than one account in
   PMS, those payees receive more than one PSC 272.

   Samples of the 272 and its subsidiary schedules are listed HERE. Each
   PSC 272 is customized to the needs of a payee's account based on: a)
   characteristics of the payee; b) characteristics of that account; and
   c) problems the payee has reported to PMS regarding the data on the PSC
   272.

   PLEASE NOTE: The samples of the PSC 272-A and PSC 272-B appear far more
   complicated than these reports will normally be for the majority of
   recipients. The intent was to show virtually all possible combinations
   of problems, conditions and error messages on a single sample of the
   PSC 272.
