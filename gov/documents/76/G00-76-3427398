             provided by the California Cooperative Snow Surveys


   Snow Surveys produces a statewide summary of snow water equivalents
   each weekday, as well as a snow sensor report and regional snowpack
   plots. Field verification of telemetered data appears in the controls
   report; there is also a summary of outages. Last years' controls are
   found here.
   Manual snow course measurements are made on or about the first of the
   month, January, February, March, April, May, and June. You can also
   retrieve long-term historical measurements or the scheduled dates for
   measurement.
   The NRCS also publishes a daily SNOTEL report, and the National Weather
   Service and CalTrans report snow depth at some locations. The NRCS
   reports are archived by OSU. The CNRFC produces a snow melt forecast in
   conjunction with Snow Surveys. More background information.
