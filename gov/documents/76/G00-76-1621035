                               GLERL's Mission

   The Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL), located in
   Ann Arbor, Michigan, is a U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) facility
   operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
   Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), through the NOAA
   Environmental Research Laboratories (ERL).

   GLERL's mission is to conduct integrated, interdisciplinary
   environmental research in support of resource management and
   environmental services in coastal and estuarine water, with special
   emphasis on the Great Lakes. GLERL's research provides Federal, State,
   and international decision and policy makers with scientific
   understanding of:

     * The sources, pathways, fates, and effects of toxicants in the Great
       Lakes.
     * Natural hazards such as severe waves, storm surges, and ice.
     * Ecosystems and their interactions, including the implications of
       invasion by nuisance species, for example, zebra mussels.
     * The hydrology and water levels of the Great Lakes.
     * Regional effects related to global climate change.

   The official mission statement (1978) reads as follows:

     "The Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) conducts
     integrated, interdisciplinary environmental research in support of
     resource management and environmental services in coastal and
     estuarine waters, with a special emphasis on the Great Lakes. The
     laboratory performs field, analytical, and laboratory investigations
     to improve understanding and prediction of coastal and estuarine
     processes, and the interdependencies with the atmosphere, and
     sediments. It places special emphasis on a systems approach to
     problem-oriented research to develop environmental service tools.
     Assistance is also provided to resource managers and others who wish
     to apply the information, tools, and services developed."
