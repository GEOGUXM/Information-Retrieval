   Have you ever wanted to peek inside an historic Presidio building? This
       is your chance to explore the elegant Victorians, stately brick
     barracks, and Mission style structures on the Presidio's Main Post.
      Nearly two dozen historic buildings, many of which have undergone
   amazing transformations, will be open to the public. The day-long event
     will also include panel discussions led by local preservationists,
       walking tours, archaeology exhibits, live music and children's
   activities. Visitors will also learn about the many organizations that
       have recently located to this wonderful place. Come explore the
                    traditional "heart of the Presidio!"

               Activities begin at the Presidio Officers' Club
                  (50 Moraga Avenue at Arguello Boulevard)
