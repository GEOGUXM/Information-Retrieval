   The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) was created by
   Constitutional Amendment with the exclusive power to license and
   regulate persons and businesses engaged in the manufacture,
   importation, distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages in
   California.

   ABC headquarters is located in Sacramento. The Department is divided
   into two divisions, Southern and Northern. There are 24 field offices
   throughout the State with a District Administrator or Supervisor in
   charge of each. The Department's sworn staff are "peace officers" with
   the authority to arrest anyone for crimes committed in California.

   ABC's Mission
     * Licensing  Approximately 52% of the Department's resources are
       devoted to its licensing mandate. There are currently more than
       72,000 licensed alcoholic beverage businesses in California, of
       which about 66,000 are retail outlets. Licensed outlets comprise
       approximately 7% of the State's one-million businesses that
       generate more than $500 million per year in State revenues.
     * Enforcement  Approximately 48% of the Department's resources are
       devoted to its enforcement mandate. Investigators investigate and
       make arrests for violations of the ABC Act and Penal Code that
       occur on or about ABC licensed businesses. ABC investigators make
       about 1,500 arrests/citations, and another 2,000 arrests/citations
       as a result of joint investigations with local law enforcement
       agencies. ABC files about 2,800 disciplinary accusations against
       licenses during the year, resulting in the State collecting about
       $2.5 million in fines.

   Alcohol-Related Problems
     * Driving Under the Influence
       In 1999, 856 people died in drunk driving collisions in California,
       and another 17,864 injured, many with life-long disabilities. Among
       the dead, 102 were teenagers who died in drunk driving collisions.
     * Binge Drinking by Teenagers (Five drinks in a row)
       The eighth biennial California Student Survey indicates the
       percentage of teens using alcohol during the last 30 days was 43.8%
       in 1999-00. College students in California are more moderate
       drinkers, but 39% of students in Northern California, and 28% in
       Southern California admit to binge drinking.

   ABC's Efforts to Address Alcohol-Related Problems
     * Grant Assistance Program
       Initiated in 1995, the Department awards grants up to $100,000 to
       local law enforcement agencies to deal with alcohol-related crime
       through education, prevention, and enforcement.
     * LEAD (License Education on Alcohol and Drugs)
       LEAD involves a free, three-hour training program for licensees and
       their employees to help them understand the rules and laws on
       selling and serving of alcohol.
