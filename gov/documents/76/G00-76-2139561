                            The Virtual Tokamak!

If your browser is JAVA friendly, you have the chance to operate your own
tokamak!

   [DRIFT.GIF] Magnetic Containment Plasma Drift Applet:

   This applet shows how magnetic fields control and contain a plasma when
   it is too hot to contain by any other conventional methods. To get the
   longest containment time, you can manually & automatically turn on/off
   magnetic controls.

   To get a feel of how magnetic fields are used to contain a plasma in a
   tokamak, try out the Plasma Drift Applet.
   [SSFD5Applet.gif] Virtual Tokamak:

   The latest version of the Virtual Tokamak allows you to type in the
   parameter values as well as use the slider bars. More control of the
   reactor means better performance which means an even higher score!
   However, PC users with older browsers and all Mac users may encounter
   Java incompatibilities and should use the classic Virtual Tokamak.
