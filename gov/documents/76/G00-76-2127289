Community Implementation "Micro-Grant" Pilot Program

   The HHS Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) is
   pleased to announce the awarding of cooperative agreements to two
   organizations to manage regional pilots of the Healthy People 2010
   Community Implementation Program. These organizations will administer
   microgrants (of up to $2010 each) to local community-based
   organizations in their areas to focus on health promotion and disease
   prevention activities that support the national health goals of Healthy
   People 2010.
   The awardees are: a) the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, which
   will pilot a project in the Ansonia, Beacon Falls, Bridgeport, Derby,
   Hartford, Naugatuck, New Haven, Oxford, Seymour, and Shelton areas of
   Connecticut, and b) the North Carolina Department of Health and Human
   Services, Division of Public Health, Office of Healthy
   Carolinians/Health Education, which will pilot its project in the state
   of North Carolina. Each pilot will award 200 microgrants to local
   community-based organizations.
   Microgrant applications will be available in late December/early
   January from the intermediary organizations. For more information about
   the projected timelines for the projects, please contact the
   intermediary awardees directly and ask to be placed on the contact list
   to receive information updates about the project status. Emails or
