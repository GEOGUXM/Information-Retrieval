   Financial Actions

   Latest Financial Developments
   [diamond.gif] Operation Wirecutter is an example of how close
   international partnership, tight interagency coordination, and a mutual
   commitment to shutting down the financial infrastructure that makes
   these criminal acts profitable, can result in a successful law
   enforcement action. Source: U.S. Department of Treasury

   [diamond.gif] The assets of two organizations and two individuals who
   have been stealing from widows and orphans to fund al Qaeda terrorism
   have been blocked. The Afghan Support Committee, branches of the

   The First 100 Days
   [diamond.gif] On September 11, terrorists attacked freedom. The world
   has responded with an unprecedented coalition against international
   terrorism. In the first 100 days of the war, President George W. Bush
   increased America's homeland security and built a successful worldwide
   coalition. The Global War on Terrorism (PDF)

   On the Financial Front Abroad
   [diamond.gif] The U.S. government created three new organizations --
   the Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center (FTAT), Operation Green
   Quest and the Terrorist Financing Task Force. These new organizations
   will help facilitate information sharing between intelligence and law
   enforcement agencies and encourage other countries to identify,
   disrupt, and defeat terrorist financing networks.

   [diamond.gif] International organizations are key partners in the war
   on financial terrorism. On September 28, the United Nations Security
   Council passed resolution 1373 that requires all nations to keep their
   financial systems free of terrorist funds.

   [diamond.gif] The Financial Action Task Force -- a 29-nation group
   promoting policies to combat money laundering -- adopted strict new
   standards to deny terrorist access to the world financial system.

   [diamond.gif] The G-20 and IMF member countries have agreed to make
   public the list of terrorists whose assets are subject to freezing, and
   the amount of assets frozen.

   support for the financial war on terror.

   assets, and others have requested U.S. help in improving their legal
   and regulatory systems so they can more effectively block terrorist
   funds.

   assets of terrorist organizations. Other nations have also blocked
   another $45.8 million for a total of $79.9 million

   to impair the ability of terrorists to fundraise, and to expose,
   isolate and incapacitate the financial networks of terrorists.

   On the Financial Home Front

   [diamond.gif] On November 7, the U.S. and its allies closed down
   operations of two major financial networks "al-Barakaat and al-Taqwa"
   both of which were used by al-Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden as sources of
   income and mechanisms to transfer funds.

   [diamond.gif] On December 4, President Bush froze the assets of a
   U.S.-based foundation "The Holy Land Foundation for Relief and
   Development" -- that has been funneling money to the terrorist
   organization Hamas.
