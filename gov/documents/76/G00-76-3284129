Acquisition Management

NSA/CSS Circular 5000R

   The National Security Agency (NSA) is progressively refining its
   acquisition strategy by taking unprecedented steps toward expanding its
   industrial base and leveraging the expertise in academia and the
   commercial marketplace. NSA has posted NSA/CSS Circular, Acquisition
   Management, to make it readily available to private industry and the
   external acquisition community in the effort to promote partnering
   opportunities with NSA.

       file, 398KB)

     Note: This is the latest version of NSA 5000R. The recently
     published rewrite of the DoD 5000, Defense Acquisition, as well as
     organizational changes, will be reflected in subsequent updates to
     this document posted on this NSA Web site. More specifically,
     sections VII, VIII, and IX of NSA 5000R will be most affected by
     these changes.

   NSA's acquisition reform strategy includes the recent appointment of
   the NSA Senior Acquisition Executive and the heightened focus to
   improve and modernize the Agency by developing a partnership with
   industry. (See NSA Press Releases issued 20 November 2000 and 7 June
   2000).

   Stay tuned to this NSA Web site for updated information related to
   NSA's acquisition reform efforts.
