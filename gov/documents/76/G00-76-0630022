   Dear Mayors and Supervisors,

        This is another series of workshops offered to municipal officials
   and other interested individuals involved with zoning and the State
   Environmental Quality Review (SEQR) law. Respondents to an earlier
   communication selected these two topics as a high priority.

        We Welcome you and your boards to attend and to pass the word out
   to whomever else you feel might benefit from this workshop.


                                               Very Truly yours,
