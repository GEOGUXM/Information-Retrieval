Landsat 7 ETM+ Sample Data

   Sample Landsat 7 ETM+ data are available for purchase at the
   substantially reduced cost of only $32 plus $5 handling. These scenes
   were selected to provide representative multispectral imagery for a
   wide range of applications, enabling all to work with the data prior to
   purchasing scenes at the normal price. The data are also ideal for use
   in education. Application categories and data summaries are provided in
   the figure below, where links lead to a full description of each scene.
   A sub sampled resolution band 5 (red) - 4 (green) - 3 (blue) browse
   image visually provides the scene extent. Narrative text specifies
   scene identification details, and includes a discussion of the
   geography, general features, category-specific features and references
   to additional information. In some cases, image enhancements were also
   performed to show how the spectral content may be processed to
   highlight features of interest.

Landsat 7 ETM+ Imagery

   Researchers familiar with earlier Landsat 4 and 5 data will note the
   addition of a 15-meter panchromatic band, two gain ranges, the improved
   60-meter spatial resolution for the thermal band, and the addition of
   two solar calibrators that contribute to improved radiometric
   calibration accuracy. Imagery is available from EROS Data Center DAAC
   in Level 0R (essentially raw data), 1R (radiometrically corrected 0R)
   and 1G (radiometrically and systematically corrected 0R) processing
   levels. During processing, the 0R image data undergo two-dimensional
   resampling according to user-specified parameters including output map
   projection, rotation angle, pixel size, and resampling kernel. Standard
   data are provided via CD, 8mm tape or electronically via FTP.
