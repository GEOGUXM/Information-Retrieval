                          ACRIMSAT Mission Overview

   EOS/ACRIM Instrument The ACRIMSAT Mission will fly an EOS ACRIM III
   instrument on a spacecraft called ACRIMSAT. The spacecraft will be
   launched as a secondary payload on a Taurus launch vehicle. The purpose
   of the mission is to monitor total solar irradiance (TSI) as part the
   U.S. Global Climate Research Program.

   The mission is funded as part of the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS)
   program and is managed by the Earth Science Programs Office at Goddard
   Space Flight Center (GSFC). The Principal Investigator is Dr. Richard
   Willson of Columbia University.

   The ACRIM III instrument is being built by the Jet Propulsion
   Laboratory (JPL). JPL will manage the subcontract with Orbital Sciences
   Corporation (OSC) to build the ACRIMSAT spacecraft. The Taurus launch
   vehicle is built by OSC. Oversight of the launch vehicle will be
   provided by the Orbital Launch Services office at GSFC.

   ACRIMSAT is scheduled to launch in December 1999. Once the spacecraft
   is launched, it will be operated and checked out by OSC personnel using
   the mission-dedicated ground station located at the Table Mountain
   Observatory (TMO). When the spacecraft and instrument have been checked
   out in flight, an Operational Readiness Review (ORR) will be conducted
   and ACRIMSAT operation will be turned over to JPL. Once this has been
   accomplished, JPL will collect data at the TMO ground station and
   transmit the data to the Principal Investigator and the Langley EOS
   Data Analysis and Archive Center for analysis and data archive.
