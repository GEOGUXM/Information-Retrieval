   Office 2000 - User Prompted for Password When Opening Office Documents in
   Browser

   We have had a number of users contact us after being prompted to enter
   a username and password when attempting to open a Word or Excel
   document off of the Emall procurement pages. After researching this
   problem, we have  found a Microsoft Knowledge Base article addressing
   this problem. This problem was corrected in the Office 2000 SR-1/SR1-a
   service pack.

   For information on obtaining this service pack, refer to the the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q245025, or contact your system
   administrator.

If you are unable to install the service pack right away, you can get around
the password by clicking cancel.
