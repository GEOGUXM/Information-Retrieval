Changes to Your U.S. Department of Education Account

   You can use this Web site to make the following changes to your U.S.
   Department of Education account:
     * Disable your PIN, which stops all access (including yours) to your
       U. S. Department of Education records through the Internet.
     * Re-enable your PIN, if you have previously disabled your account
       and you again want access to your U.S. Department of Education
       records through the Internet.
