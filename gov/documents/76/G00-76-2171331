                          Solar Eclipse 1999 Chats

             Tuesday, August 10, 8 p.m., Pacific Daylight Time:
                          Sten Odenwald, astronomer


   Sten will be viewing the last total Solar Eclipse of the Millennium
   from Alaska. Join Sten the night before to learn about the Great
   Eclipse and what you can expect to see! Read Sten's profile prior to
   joining this chat.

             Tuesday, August 10, 9 p.m., Pacific Daylight Time:
                      Chris Johns-Krull, astrophysicist


   Chris uses his knowledge of physics to understand how stars, like our
   Sun, change over time. His research includes the study of solar flares,
   the Sun's corona, and the appearance of spots. Chris is one of many
   space scientists featured as part of our series of Solar Eclipse chats.

        Wednesday, August 11, 2:30-3:30 a.m., Pacific Daylight Time:
                        Jack Ireland, solar physicist


   Jack is busy preparing for the upcoming Solar Eclipse. He is
   coordinating observations using the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer
   onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, with ground-based
   observations taken the the time of the eclipse. Jack is interested in
   why the surface of the Sun is only a few thousand degrees Kelvin, while
   the outlying corona (the part you see during the total solar eclipse)
   is often millions of degrees Kelvin. Read Jack's profile prior to
   joining this chat.
