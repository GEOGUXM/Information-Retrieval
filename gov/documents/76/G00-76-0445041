   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

   Below is a list of NIST DASE Development Environment Frequently Asked
   Questions (FAQ) list. If you have a question not found here, please

      Why is NIST implementing a DASE development environment?

        A central mission of NIST and the Convergent Information Systems
      Division is to assist U.S. industry in the development and
      implementation of forward looking standards. The ATSC DASE standard and
      interactive digital TV falls under this umbrella.

      Can NIST source code be use in my companies products?

        Yes, all NIST source code and related resources are placed in the
      public domain, free of charge. However, certain parts of NIST work may
      fall under other companies IP rights. You need to determine how this
      affects your company. See the NIST disclaimer for details on the use of
      NIST source code and redistribution procedures.

      What licenses do I need to use the NIST source code?

        All aspects of JavaTV (TM) falls under the SUN Microsystems license
      agreement. You may be required to follow those guidelines. There may
      also be licensing issues associated with the HAVi and DAVIC
      specifications. See the ATSC DASE agreement for further information.

      What is the intended use of the NIST Prototype Implementation?

        The NIST DASE PAE API prototype implementation is intended as a tool
      to aid the design and development of DASE implementations and provide
      an environment for developling and testing DASE contents/applications.
      The environment is a research/experimental platform. It is not intended
      to be used directly as a commercial product. However, implementors may
      find a substantial part of the implementation useful in thier
      implementations.

      How complete is the implementation?

        The NIST prototype implements a substantial portion of the PAE API
      specification. It, however, does not implement all APIs and certain
      implemented methods exclude certain functionality. The implementation
      was intended to demonstrate the core functionality of the standard.

      When will the implementation be completed? What are NIST plans?

        NIST will not provide any further updates to the prototype
      implementation. The technology (standard) has evolved enough where
      industry will soon adopt it. The source code will be available "as is"
      at this site. Implementation efforts have ended as of December 2001.
