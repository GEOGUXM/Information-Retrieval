                               Our mission...

   Welcome to our website!  Our office provides weather, hydrologic, and
   climate forecasts and warnings for 34 counties in southwest, central
   and south central Missouri, and 3 counties in southeast Kansas, for the
   protection of life and property and the enhancement of the economy.
   The National Weather Service data and products form a national
   information database and infrastructure which can be used by other
   governmental agencies, the private sector, the public, and the global
   community.

   Our mission is accomplished by providing warnings and forecast of
   hazardous weather, including thunderstorms, flooding,  hurricanes,
   tornadoes, winter weather, and climate events. The National Weather
   Service is the sole United States OFFICIAL voice for issuing warnings
   during life-threatening weather situations.

   Locally, Hazardous weather outlooks are issued at 6 AM and 1 PM each
   day and discuss any potential weather hazards which may affect the
   Ozark region during the ensuing 24 hours.  This includes high heat
   index values, or dangerous wind chills.  At the bottom of the outlook,
   we peek further into the future and discuss any potential hazardous
   weather for the upcoming 4 days.  You can keep up to date with all of
   the products we issue by checking out our products page.  Before
   checking out our products page though, you need to read the National
   Weather Service Disclaimer.
