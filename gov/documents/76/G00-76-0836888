Paperless Business Practices (Scanning)

   Scanning is a cross-cutting technology that will find uses in many
   aspects of the extramural programs, including review, document
   management and program administration. In its simplest version,
   scanning is the conversion of a paper document into electronic image.
   It may have additional features added, such as optical character
   reading (known as "capturing"), bookmarking and hyperlinking.

   The Paperless Business Practices (formerly Scanning) Subcommittee was
   created to get as broad a participation as possible in the effort to
   maximize the usefulness of this technology. Imaging technologies will
   almost certainly be utilized in formulating new business practices and
   has implications for file management, group editing of documents,
   maintenance of electronic records and eForms.

   This page is constantly evolving. Many of the areas below will become
