                            Population Assessment

Population Dynamics in Sharks

   Population dynamics are generally governed by ecological and genetic
   processes. From an ecological perspective, vital rates are influenced
   by demographic and ecological processes and several sources of
   stochasticity which ultimately determine whether a population increases
   or decreases. We attempt to represent the population dynamics of sharks
   through demographic methods and assess the status of their stocks
   through stock assessment methodology.

  Demographic methods

   Life tables utilize fecundity and mortality schedules to project the
   population infinitely into the future and obtain estimates of the per
   capita rate of population increase (r) or finite population growth rate
   (e^r) and other parameters of interest to population biology, such as
   the mean generation time (T). The Leslie-matrix approach also allows us
   to estimate population growth rates and, in addition, calculate
   elasticities of e^r to changes in vital rates. Elasticities can be
   calculated analytically from the dominant eigenvalue of the
   Leslie-matrix (e^r) and the stable age and reproductive value
   distributions. Elasticities measure the effect from a proportional
   change in a vital rate on e^r . Both the life table and Leslie-matrix
   approach assume density-independence and time invariance of vital rates
   and that the population will grow steadily at a rate of e^r after it
   reaches a stable age distribution. More recently, because of the
   difficulty of ageing many species of sharks, stage-based matrix models
   have also been used to describe the demography of some species, like
   the sandbar shark. Most of the demographic analyses conducted so far
   for sharks, however, have been deterministic. Because of the
   uncertainity in estimates of vital rates as well as the natural
   variability in those rates, it is necessary to adopt a stochastic
   approach. Monte Carlo simulation and elasticity analysis are very
   useful tools to investigate the demography of a species under
   uncertainity.

   We are interested in asking the following questions:

   1. How do elasmobranch uncertainty and natural variability in vital
   rates affect population growth rates and generation times?,

   2. What are the most vulnerable life stages?, and

   3. How likely is it that density-dependent compensation can offset the
   effects of exploitation given the life-history constraints of a
   particular species?

  Stock assessment methodology

   Few stock assessments of shark resources have been conducted because
   catch and catch rate data series and age data are often very limited or
   completely lacking for shark species. Biomass dynamic models (for
   example, the Schaefer model) can be used when good series of catches
   and CPUE are available. Age-structured models, such as virtual
   population analysis, dynamic pool models, yield-per-recruit models, or
   delay difference models, require knowledge of the age and growth
   dynamics of the stock. Some of the age-structured models also allow
   incorporation of gear selectivity parameters, natural mortality rates,
   and weight-at-age estimates. Recently, both biomass dynamic models and
   age-structured population models have been applied within a Bayesian
   approach to stock assessment. Bayesian methods offer the advantage of
   being able to incorporate experience into the modeling process and the
   evaluation of alternative management options. We are particularly
   interested in using the Bayesian framework with biomass dynamics and
   age-structured models to assess the status of small coastal shark
   stocks in waters off the southeastern US. Stochastic population rates
   of increase obtained through demographic methods, age and growth
   studies, gear selectivity experiments, and fishery-independent and
   fishery-dependent catch rates standardized through generalized linear
   modeling (GLM) procedures will all be incoporated into the assessment
   of small coastal sharks.

  Gillnet and Longline Selectivity

   Gillnet

   Gillnets are highly selective gear and although little is known about
   selectivity of hooks, they are believed to have a wide selection curve.
   An essential part of any age-structured stock assessment using
   commercial and recreational data collected in gillnets or longlines is
   an understanding of the selective patterns of the fishing gear.
   Knowledge of the size selectivity of commercial and recreational gears
   is crucial to the management of fish populations because it allows us
   to identify those sizes that are most susceptible to the fishing gear.
   Despite the importance of selectivity in stock assessment, the only
   estimates of selectivity functions for sharks were obtained by Kirkwood
   and Walker (1986), McLoughlin and Stevens (1994),and Simpfendorfer and
   Unsworth (1998) on species of Australian sharks. No estimates are
   available for species harvested in US waters. We are currently
   conducting comparative fishing experiments to quantitatively understand
   gillnet mesh and hook size selectivity functions for shark species
   common to US waters.

  Standardization of fishery-dependent and independent catch rates

   Stock assessment of shark populations are generally based on
   information derived from catch-per-unit effort data from fishery
   dependent and fishery-independent sources. However, certain effects
   unrelated to abundance can contribute significantly to the variability
   in catch rates. Some of these effects can include changes in fishing
   area, time of year, fishing vessel efficiency and environmental
   factors. The reliability of abundance indices can be improved by
   standardizing catch rate data to remove the impacts of unrelated
   factors. The most common approach for analyzing the interactions among
   factors and abundance is an application of a Generalized Linear Model
   procedure (GLM). Currently, we are utilizing GLMs to standardize catch
   rates from a longline survey in the northeast Gulf of Mexico and from
   the shark drift gillnet fishery off the east coast of Florida and
   Georgia.
