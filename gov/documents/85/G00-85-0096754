                 Healing the Ozone Layer with Small Brushes
             This story entered on 9th Oct, 2001 06:00:00 AM PST

   The Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) recently added
   a collection of pictures related to the ozone layer created by children
   around the world. These images are intended to unite humanity around
   the problems of ozone depletion.

   The pictures were originally compiled by The United Nations Environment
   Program (UNEP) in collaboration with the Encyclopedia of Sustainable
   Development. They may be viewed at the URL given below.
