           Non-Resident Applicants to File Fingerprint Impressions

                              What is Required?

   Beginning January 1, 2002, the California Department of Insurance (CDI)
   will require fingerprint impressions from persons applying for a
   non-resident insurance producer license from the State of California.
   The fingerprints will be submitted to the California Department of
   Justice (DOJ) and to the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) to
   ascertain whether or not the non-resident applicant has a criminal
   record that could prevent the applicant from holding a non-resident
   insurance producers license in California.

   Criminal background checks are an important safeguard to protect the
   insurance consumers from unscrupulous insurance producers.
   Fingerprinting is the most effective means to conduct an effective
   criminal background check.

   All applicants who submit a Non-Resident Individual Application** for
   an insurance license, postmarked after December 31, 2001, will be

   These fingerprint impressions must be taken by a law enforcement agency

   fingerprint card. The fingerprint card is available from the law
   enforcement agency that you contact to do the printing. To ensure that
   your fingerprint impressions are properly recorded, you must enter the
   number "A0042" on the fingerprint card in the space designated for the
   "ORI" number.


   To obtain a fingerprint card, please call the CDI's Producer Licensing
   Bureau supply line at (916) 492-3061.

   The Fingerprint card along with a check in the amount of $74 made

   processing the fingerprints, must be mailed directly to:

                                   History

   The CDI initiated a fingerprinting requirement for all producer
   applicants in 1980. However, the fingerprint check rarely revealed
   conviction information on non-resident applicants because the CDI was
   only able to check the fingerprints against the California Department
   of Justice database which consists of California reported convictions
   only. As a result, in 1988, the CDI discontinued the fingerprint
   requirement for non-residents.

   In October 2000, the CDI expanded its resident fingerprint process to
   include a check with the FBI database. The FBI database is a nationwide
   database that captures criminal convictions emanating from all 50
   states. This expanded access to criminal record information allows the
   CDI to conduct an effective criminal background check of nonresident
   applicants by reinstituting the fingerprint requirement.
