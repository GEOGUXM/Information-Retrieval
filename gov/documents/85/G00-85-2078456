   the world's foremost medical research centers, and the Federal focal
   point for medical research in the U.S. The NIH, comprised of 25

   Sciences (NIEHS) is to reduce the burden of human illness and
   dysfunction from environmental causes by understanding each of these
   elements and how they interrelate. The NIEHS achieves its mission
   through multidisciplinary biomedical research programs, prevention and
   intervention efforts, and communication strategies that encompass
   training, education, technology transfer, and community outreach.

   NTP The National Toxicology Program (NTP) was established in 1978 by
   the Secretary of Health and Human Services to coordinate toxicology
   research and testing activities within the Department, to provide
   information about potentially toxic chemicals to regulatory and
   research agencies and the public, and to strengthen the science base in
   toxicology. In its twenty-three years, the NTP has become the world's
   leader in designing, conducting, and interpreting animal assays for
   toxicity/ carcinogenicity.
