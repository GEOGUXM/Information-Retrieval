   reach projects. His continued support has helped the program continue
   and strive.

    2000

   December - Jerri Brown is the CSLP volunteer of the month for December
   2000. Jerri first started volunteered for CSLP when she worked for
   Flight Services. Since then she has moved on in her career, but with
   the electronic age has always brought CSLP with her. She continually
   reviews CSLP documents, webpages and helps with general task as needed.
   This even included times when she was recovering from surgery.

   volunteer of the month for October. For several years Alen has
   supported the CSLP student conference. This year, not only did he
   provide an interactive rocket demonstration for the students, but he
   also arranged tours for 110 students and acted as one of the tour
   guides. Alen's dedication and participation made the event a wonderful
   success.

   September - Eric Choi from the Center for Operations: Research and
   Engineering(CORE) is the volunteer of the month for September. Eric has
   volunteered his time lecturing for numerous CSLP classes,helped us
   prepare for the CSLP conference and supported the CSLP program

   problems.

   July - Dan Junker is the CSLP volunteer of the month for July 2000. Dan
   is helping to develop a Triana educational video that CSLP is working
   on. Dan scripted the flight dynamic section and allowed us to film him
   as a subject specialist. He adds life and excitement to the project as
   we filmed him in a whirling, twirling, spinning experiment that
   demonstrates orbital dynamics. The video should be complete in October.

   June - Rick Saylor from the Triana Flight Operations Team is the CSLP
   volunteer of the month for June 2000. Rick took the lead in the student
   integration and test project. With this program, on July 10 and 11th,
   students came to Goddard to develop their own integration and testing
   plan. They will assign different aspects or subsystems" to different
   CSLP schools. Each school will build a model of their subsystem. At the
   CSLP conference next October, the students will bring their subsystems
   to GSFC. They will give presentations on the subsystems and integrate
   the models together. Rick taught the students about how real
   spacecrafts are integrated at NASA and took the students on several
   tours.

   May - Maxine Russell from the Triana Flight Operations Team is the CSLP
   volunteer of the month for May 2000. Maxine has provided CSLP with
   inspirational ideas and support throughout the summer. Many of her
   ideas will be implemented at the next student conference and throughout
   the next school year. She has helped plan the student integration and
   test project, and volunteered to teach all of the CSLP students about
   flight operations by allowing us to film her in the Triana flight
   operations mission operations room. This information will be invaluable
   to help future students learn about how flight operations work.

   Telescope photos, making Bob a frequently-requested speaker at both
   Laurel and DuVal High Schools. He also supported the Spring Student
   Conference as the facilitator for one of the student activity groups.
   Bob has responded to all these requests with enthusiasm and energy, and
   has significantly contributed to the CSLP Guest Speaker's program.

   March - Katherine Arnold, CNMOS Training Manager, is the CSLP Volunteer
   of the Month for March. Due to a last-minute, high-priority conflict
   the scheduled guest speaker for the Team Building and Group Skills
   presentations had to cancel. With less than a week before the first
   lecture, Kathy put together a complete presentation package along with
   related activities for the students and delivered the lecture on
   schedule. Kathy's efforts significantly contributed to this semester's
   program by keeping the lecture schedule on track and the curriculum
   flowing in the proper order.

   February - Andy Wnuk, CNMOS TRACE Flight Operations Team, is the CSLP
   Volunteer of the Month for February. Andy has been invaluable in

   operations concepts, and component layout; and has provided and
   explained several subsystems diagrams to help in the construction. Andy
   has also traveled all the way to Glen Rock Elementary School in Glen
   Rock, PA, to make a presentation on spacecraft and rockets. He assisted
   students in the understanding of how rockets work, and provided
   practical examples of real world rocket successes and failures. Andy's

  Other Volunteers

   Volunteers from NASA, ATSC, and other aerospace companies play an
   invaluable role in making the Cooperative Satellite Learning Project
   (CSLP) a success. Specialists in areas such as spacecraft design,
   mission operations, information data processing, share their expertise
   with CSLP students.

   During the summer of 1995, ATSC held a Rewards & Recognition ceremony
   to acknowledge the hard work of the many dedicated CSLP volunteers. All
   individuals who delivered technical lectures, conducted student tours
   of GSFC, or assisted with the CSLP annual student conference, were
   acknowledged. Additionally, two individuals (Leo McConville and Matt
   Fatig) were given ATSC Ruby Awards, for their long-term commitment to
   the program (see photo below):
