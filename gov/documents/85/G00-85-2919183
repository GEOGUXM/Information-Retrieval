                          Dr. Arthur Holly Compton

   American physicist Arthur Holly Compton was one of the pioneers of
   high-energy physics. In 1927 he received the Nobel prize in physics for
   his definitive study of the scattering of high-energy photons by
   electrons which became known as the Compton Effect. This work was
   recognized as an experimental proof that electromagnetic radiation
   possessed both wave-like and particle-like properties and laid a
   foundation for the new "quantum" physics. All the experiments onboard
   the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory rely on the detailed knowledge of the
   interaction of high-energy gamma-rays with matter that Compton first
   described.
   Compton's work in the early 1920's on the scattering of high-energy
   photons was carried out while he was head of the Department of Physics
   at Washington University in St. Louis. He later went to the University
   of Chicago where he eventually switched to the study of cosmic rays.
   During the Second World War he played a major role in the atomic bomb
   project as director of the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University
   of Chicago. At the end of the war, he returned to Washington University
   as Chancellor and retired in 1953.
