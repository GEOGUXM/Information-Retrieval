   SEER*Stat 4.1

   SEER*Stat is a statistical system for the analysis of SEER and other
   cancer databases. It provides cancer investigators with an easy to use
   Microsoft Windows (95, 98, NT, 2000, etc.) desktop package for viewing
   individual cancer records, and the production of the statistics useful
   in studying the impact of cancer on a population. These statistics
   include age-adjusted rates, relative survival rates, and others.

   SEER*Prep 1.7

   The SEER*Prep system allows cancer investigators to prepare and format
   their own cancer incidence, mortality, population, and expected
   survival rate data for use with SEER*Stat. The major supported file
   formats are as follows.

   Incidence:

   [bullet] NAACCR 1525 byte version 7 incidence-only record type (dated
            4/13/1998)
   [bullet] SEER 250 byte August 2000 (from the SEER Program Code Manual
            3rd Edition, January 1998)
   Mortality:
   [bullet] SEER*Prep 58 byte October 2000 (developed specifically for
            this application by the SEER Program)

   Cancer Query System 2.0 - including 1973-1998 statistics

   CanQues is an interactive system with a Java interface that allows the
   user to access millions of pre-calculated cancer statistics. For
   output, the user has the choice of a vertical bar chart, a line chart,
   a tabular report, or a delimited data file. CanQues contains statistics
   that were created using SEER*Stat for SEER's routine reporting and the
   SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1973-1998.

   You must have a recent version of Netscape or Microsoft Internet
   Explorer to utilize this Java 1.1 system. The Netscape Products page
   and the Microsoft Download Center contain the most recent version of
   these respective products. The majority of testing has been conducted
   with Netscape Navigator 4.08 and Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 SP1.

   Example Reports (dynamically generated):

[bullet] Vertical bar chart: Age-adjusted rates for female breast
         cancer using the world standard population. The rates will be for the
         time period 1994-1998 and the combination of the nine standard SEER
         registries. The X-axis variable will be Race with White and Black
         presented. The series variable will be Age at diagnosis with All ages,
         < 50, and 50+.
[bullet] Line chart: Crude rates for female breast cancer. The rates
         will be for the time period 1992-1998 and the combination of the eleven
         standard SEER registries. The X-axis variable will be Age at diagnosis
         with eighteen five year age groups presented. The series variable will
         be Race/ethnicity with White, Black, American Indian/Aleutian
         Islander/Eskimo, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic.

   SEER Inquiry System

   The SEER Inquiry System (SINQ) provides a database of questions and
   answers on SEER coding. This new implementation is entirely Web based
   and replaces SEER's older Microsoft DOS system.

   DevCan - maintained by the Statistical Research and Applications Branch
   (SRAB), NCI

   DevCan is Windows-based statistical software which takes
   cross-sectional counts of incident cases from the standard SEER areas
   and mortality counts for the same areas from data collected by the
   National Center for Health Statistics by five-year age groups and uses
   them to calculate incidence and mortality rates using population
   estimates from census data for these areas. These rates are converted
   to probabilities using an exponential model, and the probabilities are
   then applied to a hypothetical population of ten million live births.
   For each five-year time interval, this system estimates the number in
   this population dying of other causes, the number of new cases, and the
   number alive and cancer free at the beginning of the interval, as well
   as the lifetime probability of developing cancer.

   Joinpoint - maintained by the Statistical Research and Applications
   Branch (SRAB), NCI

   Joinpoint is Windows-based statistical software to analyze joinpoint
   models, that is, models where several different lines are connected
   together at the "joinpoints". The software takes trend data (e.g cancer
   rates) and fits the simplest joinpoint model that the data allow. The
   user supplies the minimum and maximum number of joinpoints. The program
   starts with the minimum number of joinpoint (e.g. 0 joinpoints, which
   is a straight line) and tests whether more joinpoints are statistically
   significant and must be added to the model (up to that maximum number).
   This enables the user to test that an apparent change in trend is
   statistically significant.
