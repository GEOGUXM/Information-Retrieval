                  Project Science Office Organization Chart

   Welcome to the web site for the Hubble Space Telescope Project Science
   Office.

   The HST is NASA's first orbiting space observatory. It has been
   remarkably successful for many reasons. One of the most important
   reasons is that the HST is the first spacecraft specifically designed
   to benefit from on-orbit astronaut servicing. This radically different
   approach enables the periodic maintenance and upgrade missions to HST
   that have substantially improved its scientific performance since it
   was launched in 1990. For more information about the HST Program, see
   our Program Overview and The Hubble Space Telescope Project Site.

   The HST is unique. As the only space observatory of its kind in
   existence, the HST's management, maintenance, and operations all
   require unique and innovative approaches. It is our hope that some of
   the excitement and enthusiasm we have for our work will be conveyed to
   you through this site.

   Project Science:
   The role of the Project Scientist in any NASA mission is to ensure that
   the mission meets its scientific potential. For the HST, the
   responsibilities for scientific oversight are divided up among the
   members of the Project Science Office (PSO). The PSO is designed to
   interact effectively and efficiently with the HST flight project and
   the wide range of external organizations involved with the HST. The
   members of the PSO team are organized according to the groups they
   advise:

   The Office of the Associate Director of Flight Projects for the HST.
   The Senior Scientist for the HST and his staff work in the Office of
   the Associate Director of Flight Projects for HST. This group is
   concerned with the highest level of scientific management for the
   Project. Examples of their activities include budgetary oversight for
   the HST scientific activities, the organization of major scientific
   reviews and presentations to the Project, and outreach planning. For
   more information, please contact Dr. David Leckrone, NASA/GSFC Code
   440, Greenbelt, MD 20771, 301-286-5975, e-mail
   david.leckrone@gsfc.nasa.gov.

   Operations and Ground Systems.
   The Project Scientist for Operations and Ground Systems (O&GS) works
   with the Project Manager for O&GS to optimize HST operations for
   scientific excellence. This includes monitoring the operations
   infrastructure for ensuring a safe and productive spacecraft, while
   also considering the highest levels of scientific planning, scheduling,
   and budgeting for the scientific research done with HST. The Space
   Telescope Science Institute, located in Baltimore, MD, is managed
   within the HST O&GS Project. For more information, please contact Dr.
   Ken Carpenter, NASA/GSFC Code 681, Greenbelt, MD 20771, 301-286-3453,
   e-mail kenneth.carpenter@gsfc.nasa.gov.
   Flight Systems and Servicing.
   The Project Scientist for Flight Systems and Servicing (FS&S) works
   with the Project Manager for FS&S to ensure that the hardware
   development and servicing activities for the HST are providing the best
   scientific return possible. This includes Science Instrument
   development activities, and spacecraft maintenance and upgrades. All
   flight hardware for the HST is developed within this organization. For
   more information, please contact Dr. Edward Cheng, NASA/GSFC Code 685,
   Greenbelt, MD 20771, 301- 286-5038, e-mail edward.cheng@gsfc.nasa.gov.

   The PSO works as a team to ensure that all aspects of the HST Program
   work together so that the HST produces the best scientific results
   possible.

   The HST mission is all about science, and the PSO has the job of making
   sure that science comes first!
