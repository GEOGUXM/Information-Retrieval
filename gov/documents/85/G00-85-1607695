   ''
   Estuaries are a critical interface between terrestrial and marine
   ecosystems.
   Gulf Estuaries encompass approx. 30,000 sq. km. (42% of the total
   estuarine surface area of the U.S. excluding Alaska).

Welcome to the Gulf of Mexico Integrated Science web site.

   The key to understanding complex estuarine systems lies in
   understanding the interactions between geological framework and
   biological, geochemical and hydrological processes.
   This project was established to develop an integrated science strategy
   for assessing and monitoring Gulf of Mexico estuaries using Tampa Bay
   as a pilot study.
   The success of this project is founded on coordination of a
   multidisciplinary team of USGS scientists with key Federal, State and
   local agencies.
