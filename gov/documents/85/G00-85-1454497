                                             Operations Manual Letter 4-99

   In order to reflect the changes that each office's operations will
   undergo as its Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS)
   is commissioned, this OML outlines the following changes in terminology
   that shall be applied:

     * The facilities identified as NEXRAD Weather Service Forecast Office
       (NWSFO) and NEXRAD Weather Service Office (NWSO) will be renamed to
       reflect their status as Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) once the
       AWIPS is commissioned. The policy and procedures detailed in the
       reference chapters apply to offices with commissioned AWIPS.
     * The term AWIPS may be applied to all instances where the term
       Automation of Field Operations and Services (AFOS) is used in the
       chapter with no impact on the policy or procedure(s) being defined.
