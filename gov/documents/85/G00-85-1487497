     engineering design for all non-nuclear components in the nationís
    nuclear weapons continues today, but Sandia now also performs a wide

       (4) How many employees do you have? Sandia employed about 7,450
    regular, full-time employees as of July 2000. More than 6,600 work at
   Sandia/New Mexico (main lab and headquarters in Albuquerque, N.M.), and
   about 850 work at Sandia/California in Livermore. A few employees work
                     in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere.

      maintain a work force of about 7,450 full-time employees for the
      foreseeable future. Employment opportunities are limited in this
     environment, particularly for administrative and support personnel.

    computing, and other technical skills and knowledge that are critical
   to our missions. And Sandia continues to hire some student interns. For
               more information see Employment Opportunities.

     (6) How did Sandia National Laboratories get its name? Sandia means
     watermelon in Spanish. The mountains east of Albuquerque, N.M., are
   called the Sandia Mountains because they take on a color similar to the
      inside of a watermelon late on sunny days. When Sandia Laboratory
   became a separate entity in 1949 it was first a division of Los Alamos
         Laboratory for several years and was located exclusively on
     Albuquerqueís Sandia Base, since renamed Kirtland Air Force Base.
        Sandia took a plural name, Sandia Laboratories, in 1956 after
       establishing another major facility in Livermore, Calif. Sandia
   National Laboratories became the official name in 1979 after Sandia was
     designated one of the Department of Energys unique national labs.
