          A plain text version of this biography is also available.

   Don Evans is the 34th Secretary to lead the Department of Commerce, the
   voice of business in government. He oversees a diverse Cabinet agency
   of 40,000 workers and a $5 billion budget that not only promotes
   American business but gathers vast quantities of economic and
   demographic data, issues patents and trademarks, helps set industrial
   standards, forecasts the weather and researches the oceans. He is a key
   member of President Bush's economic policy team and special task force
   on energy.

   A former businessman, Secretary Evans believes very strongly in the
   free-enterprise system. He sees it as one of the core values of America
   and his main mission as Commerce Secretary is creating an environment
   in which American businesses and workers can thrive in the global
   economy. He has an aggressive agenda to get the job done. At the top of
   the list is trade. In his first five months, he visited five countries
   to promote American exports and to open markets. In the months ahead
   he'll be working to strengthen U.S. trade and investment with Russia,
   and helping the President secure from the Congress trade promotion
   authority to negotiate new trade opening deals.

   Secretary Evans thinks what U.S. businesses need most in the global
   market is a level playing field. He is making certain the Department
   has adequate resources to enforce market opening agreements with other
   nations. At the request of the President, he is seeking an
   investigation by the International Trade Commission into whether the
   U.S. steel industry is being harmed by unfair trade practices and he is
   helping launch global talks aimed at reducing excess steel production
   capacity around the world.

   Also on his agenda are redefining the role of government in research in
   a way that generates the development of more cutting-edge technologies;
   promoting the expansion of e-commerce with as little government
   intervention as possible; and improving the Department's economic data
   collection and distribution capabilities.

   Secretary Evans was sworn into office on January 20, 2001. Born in
   Houston, Texas in 1946, Secretary Evans attended the University of
   Texas at Austin, receiving a BS in Mechanical Engineering in 1969 and
   an MBA in 1973. While at UT, he was a member of Omicron Delta Kappa and
   the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

   In 1975, Secretary Evans moved to Midland, Texas from Houston and began
   roughnecking on an oil rig for Tom Brown Inc., a large independent
   energy company now based in Denver. Ten years later he took the company
   over as CEO and continued running it until becoming Commerce Secretary.

   Secretary Evans is a self-described optimist who believes the highest
   calling in life is serving others. As a result, he has been very active
   in community service over the years. In 1995 he was appointed by
   Governor Bush to the Board of Regents of the University of Texas,
   serving as Chairman of the Board for the last four years. He was a
   board member of the Scleroderma Research Foundation for 8 years and a
   driving force behind Native Vision, a program that provides services to
   some 10,000 Native American children. He has been involved with the
   United Way for many years, serving as President in 1989 and Campaign
   Chair in 1981. He has been named Jaycees Man of the Year.

   Secretary Evans has made significant contributions in local and
   national politics in the past 25 years having worked for Governor
   Bush's successful gubernatorial campaigns in 1994 and 1998, and serving
   as Chairman of the Bush/Cheney 2000 campaign.

   Secretary Evans says his passions in life are his family and his
   friends and spending time with them. He is married to Susan Marinis
   Evans. They have two daughters, a son and a granddaughter.
