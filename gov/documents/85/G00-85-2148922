   Backflow Program


   The City of Flagstaff Industrial Waste Monitoring Division administers
   a cross connection control program that is required by the Arizona
   Department of Environmental Quality. This program is designed to
   prevent contamination of the public water supply system due to backflow
   from piping systems, which might contain something other than drinkable
   water. The cross connection control program incorporates several
   functions, including inspection and regulation of plumbing and piping
   systems, review of proposed construction plans, public education and
   inspection, testing and performance monitoring of backflow prevention
   assemblies (valves which allow water to flow in only one direction).
