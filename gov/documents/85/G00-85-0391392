                                        About the Computing Division

                     The Computing Division provides computing resources and services to
     help accomplish the lab's scientific mission. It also supports
     networking, shared facilities, personal computers and other
     specialized facilities which not only directly support the
     scientific program, but also provide support for many of the
     engineering, technical and administrative needs of the lab.

     The range of services offered to experiments includes:
     * Computer Use Policy, Security Advice and Monitoring
     * High Speed networks throughout the Laboratory and for wide area
       access to and from the site
     * Electronics and Data Acquisition Systems Computing for Simulation,
       Reconstruction, and Data Analysis
     * Robotic Storage Systems for experiment data
     * General purpose batch and interactive computing
     * General application software and physics software tools
     * Centrally hosted Web Servers
     * Video conferencing tools and scheduling
     * Workgroup and Desktop support
     * Central Information Systems and Services

     The Computing Division maintains an active program of system and
     service development and innovation. For experiments with challenging
     computing, data handling and/or data acquisition requirements the
     Computing Division will frequently enter into collaborative
     arrangements for the development and support of the experiment
     systems. The Computing Division maintains a small program of
     research into new technologies expected to be beneficial to future
     experiments.
