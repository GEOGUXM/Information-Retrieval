                      COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT

                              MISSION STATEMENT

   The mission of the Community Development Department is to assist the
   community in preparing, administering and implementing community
   development policies and ordinances that result in the highest quality
   standards of appearance and convenience for the Village of Burr Ridge.
   In pursuit of this mission, the Department is responsible for
   implementing the Village's Comprehensive Land Use Plan, Subdivision
   Ordinance, Zoning Ordinance, Sign Ordinance, Building Code, and
   Property Maintenance Code. The Department provides staff support to the
   Plan Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals.  The Community Development
   Department is responsible for preparing long range plans and for the
   various tools intended to implement the Village's long range plans.

                            STAFFING AND SERVICES

     The various positions and their responsibilities as reflected after
   re-organization are as follows:

     The Community Development Director is responsible for all aspects of
     the Community Development Department and holds the title Building
     Commissioner.   The Director also serves as the primary staff
     liaison to the development community and provides land use planning
     expertise to the Plan Commission and Board of Trustees.

     The Planner's primary responsibility is to coordinate the Village's
     review of subdivisions including processing of subdivision
     documentation and review of plats to ensure compliance with the
     Subdivision Ordinance, Zoning Ordinance, and Comprehensive Land Use
     Plan.  Other responsibilities of the Planner include providing
     public information regarding planning and zoning documents,
     assisting the Director as staff liaison to the Plan Commission;
     staff support to the Plan Commission and other professional level
     planning services.  For Fiscal Year 2000-01, the Planner will also
     be responsible for reviewing all residential building permits to
     determine compliance with the Zoning Ordinance standards (except
     Floor Area Ratio which will continue to be reviewed by the
     consultant)

     The Deputy Building Commissioner oversees all aspects of code
     enforcement and conducts architectural plan reviews, building
     inspections, and compliance inquiries.  Other code enforcement
     services are provided  by the Village's building consultant
     including non-residential inspections, plumbing inspections, and
     backup support for the Deputy Building Commissioner.

     The Building and Zoning Assistant is responsible for processing of
     building permit applications; providing building and zoning code
     information to the public, coordination of plan review and
     inspection services, and administration of the Village's permit
     system software program.

     The Department's operations are focused on long range planning and
     enforcement of the Village's building, zoning, and subdivision
     ordinances.  The re-organization implemented during this fiscal year
     has enabled the Department to increase its services and to
     substantially reduce costs.
