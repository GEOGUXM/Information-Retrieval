   Annual air concentration densities of iodine-131 are displayed in
   nanocuries (one-billionth of a "curie").
   A curie is a unit of radioactivity corresponding to 37 billion
   disintegrations per second.
   The cubic meter concentration values and representative thyroid doses
   are available for each of the 1102 sectors in the study grid. Colors
   for each of the years 1945-1951 have been selected to help convey the
   differences in the ranges of concentration values. Charts
