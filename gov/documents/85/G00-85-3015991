      January 24, 2002
          Europe starts out 2002 cold and snowy while hailstorms and heavy
          rains hit parts of eastern Australia. The continental U.S. has a
          variety of weather with a southern snowstorm and generally mild
          conditions across a large part of the country. See the current
          Climate Watch report for additional information on these and other
          extreme weather and climate events around the globe.

   Top of Page Climate of 2001, December in Historical Perspective New Hot

      January 15, 2002
          Globally averaged surface temperatures were tenth warmest on record
          for December, based on preliminary data. The global land and ocean
          temperature was 0.65°F (0.36°C) above the 1880-2000 long term mean.
          Based on long-term data from the U.S. Historical Climate Network
          (USHCN) and preliminary data from the Climate Division Database,
          the preliminary U.S. nationally averaged temperature during
          December was 36.6°F (2.6°C) which ranked as 12th warmest. Vermont
          and New Jersey had a record warm December, while South Dakota and
          Nebraska experienced their second and third driest December in the
          1895 to present record, respectively. A major lake-effect snow
          episode brought record snowfall amounts to the greater Buffalo, New
          York area late in the month, shattering December snowfall records.

   Top of Page Climate of 2001, Annual Review Final Report New Hot

      January 15, 2002
          Based on data received through the year, the average annual global
          temperature was 57.9°F (14.4°C), which is 0.9°F (0.5°C) above the
          1880-2000 long-term average, which makes 2001 the second warmest
          year on record. For the contiguous U.S., the preliminary 2001
          average annual temperature was 54.3° F (12.4° C), which was 1.5° F
          (0.8° C) above the 1895-2001 mean; the sixth warmest in the record.
          Regionally, Alaska experienced its warmest winter (Dec00-Feb01),
          while Maine had the driest year on record for 2001. It was also
          among the ten driest years on record for eight other east coast
          states. The 2001 Atlantic hurricane season was the fifth most
          active season on record, with 15 named tropical storms, nine of
          which became hurricanes and four reaching major hurricane strength.

   Top of Page Newly Computed Climate Normals New Hot

      January 9, 2002
          Data used by weather forecasters as a benchmark for comparing
          day-to-day temperature and rainfall departures have been developed
          for the 1971-2000 period. Monthly and daily climate normals are now
          available in both digital data (ASCII) and digital publication
          (PDF) formats. Normals are available for nearly 8,000 stations in
          the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the U.S.
          Pacific Islands are included in the digital files. Customers may
          order the files on-line. The new temperature and precipitation
          normals are being implemented for use by NOAAs National Weather
          Service in daily and monthly climate reports beginning in January
          2002.

   Top of Page Climate of 2001, November in Historical Perspective New

      December 17, 2001
          Globally averaged surface temperatures were the warmest on record
          for November, based on preliminary data. The global land and ocean
          temperature was 1.15°F (0.64°C) above the 1880-2000 long term mean.
          For the period September-November, globally averaged surface
          temperatures tied with 1997 as the warmest since 1880. Based on
          long-term data from the U.S. Historical Climate Network (USHCN) and
          preliminary data from the Climate Division Database, the
          preliminary nationally averaged temperature during November was
          47.8°F (8.8°C), or the second warmest November in the 1895 to
          present record. Fall temperatures for the United States ranked as
          fourth warmest. Both Nevada and New Mexico had the warmest fall on
          record, while Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and
          New Jersey all experienced a record warm November. In addition, it
          was the driest fall on record for the state of Virginia.

          This 42-page report describes the background, development,
          processing, and quality control of the new Federal Climate Complex
          Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) database. The database includes

   Top of Page U.S. Climate Reference Network (CRN) New Hot

      December 6, 2001
          The U.S. Climate Reference Network (CRN) is a network of climate
          stations now being developed as part of a National Oceanic and
          Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) initiative. The primary goal of
          its implementation is to provide future long-term homogeneous
          observations of temperature and precipitation that can be coupled
          to past long-term observations for the detection and attribution of
          present and future climate change.

      December 5, 2001
          Snow has piled up in the Rockies the last few weeks and warm, dry
          weather continues for the first part of December in the Eastern
          United States. Storminess and accompanied flooding hit parts of
          coastal Turkey during the beginning of the month as well. Are you
          interested in what the chances are of a White Christmas? See the
          December climate watch pages for the probabilities based on the
          historical climate data for previous Christmas mornings. Also, see
          the current watch report for additional information on these and
          other extreme weather and climate events around the globe.

          parameters as max/min temperature, precipitation, heating/cooling
          days. The publication also contains monthly normals, historical
          data, and graphs. The cost is $130.00 (representing a savings from
          the offline cost) and includes access to all stations for years
          1997-present. This subscription can ordered via the Online Store

          Hurricane Iris was a category 4 hurricane as she struck the Belize
          coast on October 8th, 2001. The fast forward speed of the storm
          prohibited extensive flooding along its path but at least 11 people
          are dead due to Hurricane Iris, the victims were among 28 people
          who were on a boat at Big Creek Port, officials said. The storm
          left 900 people homeless and was the strongest hurricane to hit the
          south coast of Belize in nearly 60 years.See the October 2001
          Climate Watch report for additional information on these and other
          extreme weather and climate events around the globe.
