   ISS Commercial Development

      NASA has supported scientific and commercial research in the life and
      microgravity sciences for approximately fifteen years, beginning with
      the operation of the Space Shuttle fleet. However, the cumulative
      research time on board the Space Shuttles has been only about six
      months. With the advent of the ISS, researchers will have access to a
      space laboratory for periods of years, with greater resources than any
      previous orbiting facility. The ISS will provide greater research
      flexibility, regular crew interaction with experiments, and time for
      iterative or multi-generational research. The following shows the
      ongoing research funded by NASA during the first era of space research.
      The ISS will usher in a new era and promises new scientific knowledge
      and economic benefits to people on Earth.

     * Research on Station October, 2001
       NASA's Office of Biological and Physical Research announces the
       newest section of the SpaceResearch.nasa.gov Web site: Research on
       Station. This new section is a source for information on all
       experiment payloads and research facilities on the International
       Space Station- past, present, and future.
     * Research Opportunities
       The NASA/OBPR Research Opportunities Home Page provides information
       on research opportunities provided by NASA's Office of Biological
       and Physical Research (OBPR). Here you can download and print
       research announcements, add, remove, or update your address in our
       mailing list, or find out more about ongoing research funded by
       OBPR.
     * Research Taskbooks:
       The Research Task Books are descriptions of all peer-reviewed
       science projects, or tasks, funded by the NASA OBPR in the area of
       Life Sciences and Microgravity Research during all or part of a
       particular fiscal year. Each task listed includes a description,
       progress, and a list of publications, presentations, and other
       accomplishments for that fiscal year.

       The ISS Science and Technology Research Directions documents
       describe the disciplines that will be explored on the ISS along
       with specific research questions associated with that discipline.
       For each discipline, answers are provided for the following
       questions:
          + What is the purpose of this research discipline?
          + What is the "overarching question" that research in this
            discipline strives to answer?
          + What aspects of the question are currently under
            investigation?
       In addition, the specific ISS utilization flight or assembly flight
       that will accommodate that research discipline is identified.
