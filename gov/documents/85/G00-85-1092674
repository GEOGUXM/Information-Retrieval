   CCMA's Biogeography team is leading a project to consistently and
   comprehensively map the distribution of coral reefs and other benthic
   habitats throughout the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Aerial
   photographs are being used to create a digital map of the marine
   resources in the region including coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangrove
   forests, and other important marine resources for fisheries, tourism,
   and other aspects of the coastal economy. The primary product of this
   effort will be benthic habitat maps (in a Geographic Information
   System, GIS) although a methods document and a georeferenced mosaic
   composed of digital scans of the raw photographs are also under
   production. The benthic maps are being created using visual
   interpretation of scanned aerial photographs.  The specific techniques
   used to produce the habitat map will be documented in the methods
   document and provided to the local research and management communities
   to build their ability to conduct similar habitat assessments in the
   future. The georeferenced photo-mosaic, the methods document, and GIS
   coverages of the benthic habitat maps will be provided on CD-ROM or
   downloadable from the Biogeography Team's Website.

    The "Benthic Habitats of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands" project
   will support many activities including fishery management, coastal zone
   management, disaster mitigation (e.g. hurricanes, boat grounding), and
   academic and government research of the region's marine resources. The
   images will provide a valuable spatial database of marine resources
   that can be compared to historical and future datasets to evaluate
   changes in habitat distribution following hurricanes, boat grounding,
   coastal development, and other acute and/or long term alterations to
   the marine community. The habitat maps are designed to be compatible
   with other GIS data layers. For example, habitat maps can be compared
   to: the boundaries of marine protected areas and areas of particular
   concern and to support designation of future marine reserves, locations
   of coastal construction in relation to ocean circulation patterns and
   sensitive habitats to assist in planing sustainable development, or a
   database of habitat affinities for fisheries species to produce maps of
   fish distribution for developing essential fish habitat maps in
   response to the recent amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
   Conservation and Management Act.

    Important updates on project status will be posted on this site as
   they occur. The mapping project includes many interrelated activities
   centered on five tasks. Those tasks include: development of a habitat
   classification manual, visual interpretation of scanned photos, visual
   interpretation of hard copy photos, comparison of classification
   techniques, and creation of the GIS. To illustrate the relationships
   between project components, a flowchart depicting project activities
   and goals can be found below. Status of each project component is
   indicated (completed vs. uncompleted) and if "uncompleted" a target
   date for completion is indicated along the bottom of the chart. In
   addition to this overview of the project, more detailed updates will be
   given as progress occurs under each of the main project activities
   indicated above.
