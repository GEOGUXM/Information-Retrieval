                      Project Schedule | Presidential Records Act Overview

   The Federal Register, which is part of NARA, and the Government
   Printing Office (GPO) provide online access to material compiled from
   the hardcover copies of The Public Papers of the Presidents of the
   United States.

   Each Public Papers volume contains the papers and speeches of William
   Jefferson Clinton that were issued by the Office of the Press Secretary
   during the specified time period. The material is presented in
   chronological order, and the dates shown in the headings are the dates
   of the documents or events.

   In instances when the release date differs from the date of the
   document itself, that fact is shown in the textnote.

   To ensure accuracy, remarks have been checked against a tape recording
   and signed documents have been checked against the original, unless
   otherwise noted.

   Textnotes and cross references have been provided by the editors for
   purposes of identification or clarity.

   Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, unless indicated. The times
   noted are local times.
