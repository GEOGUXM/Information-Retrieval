   Governor's Academic Mentor Program

   The Academic Volunteer and Mentor Service Program (AVMSP) is charged
   with the goal of matching every child in need of one with an academic
   mentor. To accomplish this, The Governors Office, Office of the
   Secretary for Education (OSE) administers $10 million annually in local
   assistance grants to recruit volunteer mentors to work with at-risk
   children in the school setting. Mentors provide academic guidance, role
   modeling and companionship to students who need motivation and
   encouragement. Over 145 school-based mentor programs in California have
   received funding through this program, with 17,000 mentors serving
   15,000-20,000 students each year. Grants are awarded for a term of
   three years, with a maximum annual grant amount of $100,000 per site.

   Selection for participation in the Academic Volunteer and Mentor
   Service Program is based on a highly selective competitive bid process.
   Each applicant is required to submit a funding proposal that clearly
   articulates the need for an academic mentoring program in a school
   environment and is required to address the ten AVMSP Program Quality
   Standards of effective academic mentoring programs. To ensure
   accountability and on-going compliance with the AVMSP Program Quality
   Standards, awardees are subject to the submission of results-based
   quarterly reports and site visits from OSE program staff.
