   Printed Material
   (Viewgraphs, Papers, Posters)

   Note: All of the Macintosh files have been compressed using Stuffit.
   When a file is downloaded, two files appear on your computer. The
   graphic file is the one without the "hqx" at the end of the file name.

   If you are using a PostScript printer (such as an Apple LaserWriter)
   and a program that can import Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) graphics
   (such as Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, PowerPoint, Adobe Illustrator,
   Adobe Photoshop, Adobe PageMaker, and most modern word processors), you
   should download one of the EPS graphics below. These EPS graphics can
   be resized without loss of print quality.

   Mac EPS (159K)

   PC EPS (64K)

   If you are using MacDraw Pro or Claris Draw, do not have access to a
   PostScript printer, or you are using a program that cannot import
   Encapsulated PostScript, such as MacDraw, download one of the 150 dpi
   bitmapped graphics below. For good printing results, these graphics
   should not be resized.
