Benthic Mapping


   Benthic Habitat Mapping in National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERR)
   To date, the occurrence and distribution of various habitat types and
   features have been mapped in the Reserves in the Hudson River, New York
   and Apalachicola Bay, Florida.

   Benthic Mapping
   These projects were undertaken to characterize and/or map benthic
   (bottom) habitats in coastal areas of the United States and territories
   using various remote sensing technologies and in situ sampling methods.

   Submerged Aquatic Vegetation: Data Development and Applied Uses
   This CD-ROM includes technical mapping guidance, information about
   seagrasses, and examples of how submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) data
   and maps are used.

Environmental Characterizations

   Environmental Characterizations
   Characterizations provide comprehensive information about a particular
   areas environment, people, and issues. The resulting inventory is used
   as a management tool, educational resource, and an historical
   reference.
     * ACE Basin, South Carolina
     * Kachemak Bay, Alaska
     * Rookery Bay/Belle Meade Watershed, Florida

   Estuarine Habitat
   Aircraft-mounted sensors used to help scientists understand the
   small-scale spatial variability in rivers and estuaries.

   Florida Bay Imagery and Information CD-ROM
   This satellite imagery allows users to quickly document and observe
   water clarity trends and patterns.

   Southeast Coast and Ocean Margin
   The Southeast Coast and Ocean Margin (SEaCOM) program promotes and
   integrates scientific investigation, education, and mapping for
   sustainable use of the southeast U.S. coastal ocean.

   Spatial Wetland Assessment for Management and Planning (SWAMP)
   Uses GIS and basic ecological principles to evaluate the relative
   significance of wetlands within a watershed.

Land Cover Analysis

   Land Cover Analysis
   This project is an interagency effort to map terrestrial land resources
   in estuarine watershed environments and identify changes in these
   areas.

   Land Cover Change CD-ROMs
   Easy-to-use satellite-derived land cover data and a variety of other
   spatial data layers can be found on these CD-ROMs.
     * Columbia River Estuary, Washington/Oregon Land Cover Change CD-ROM
     * Yakutat, Alaska Land Cover Change CD-ROM
     * San Francisco Bay Area Land Cover Change CD-ROM
     * South Carolina`s Coast: A Remote Sensing Perspective

   South Carolina`s Coast: A Remote Sensing Perspective
   Contains land cover and shoreline data, as well as the software needed
   to bring this information to a desktop computer.

   Using Remote Sensing to Address Coastal Management Issues: The Maine
   Project
   Look at this CD-ROM if you would like to see how coastal issues can be
   addressed using remote sensing and GIS.

Habitat Restorations

   Goal Setting and Success Criteria for Coastal Habitat Restoration
   Proceedings from this 1998 conference are published as a dedicated
   issue of the journal "Ecological Engineering."

   Rhode Island Coastal Habitats Restoration Planning and Information
   System
   Utilizes GIS and Internet technologies to provide information and data
   regarding restoration activities and state restoration plans.

Harmful Algal Blooms

   Harmful Algal Bloom Forecast
   GIS is used to integrate the data required to predict, detect, and
   verify Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) events.

   Harmful Algal Bloom Workshop Proceedings
   These proceedings are from a 1997 workshop entitled "Application of
   Remote Sensing to Red Tide Forecasts in the Gulf of Mexico."
