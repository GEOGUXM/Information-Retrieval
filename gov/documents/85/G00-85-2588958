                     [California Energy Commission Letterhead]

        Dear Visitor,

        Welcome to the California Energy Commission's website. We hope that
        your visit will help you understand the important role energy plays
        in our state's economy, the sixth largest in the world. Electronic
        information is vital to economic development and understanding of
        our changing world. That's why we created this website back in
        December 1994 and keep working to improve it and update it and its
        contents.

        With this in mind, a new website for consumers, the Consumer Energy
        Center, was unveiled by Governor Davis in February 2001 that makes
        information more accessible. You will find site navigation easier,
        and you have a very powerful search engine at your fingertips. With
        the challenges we face in electricity and gasoline, we know that
        information is critical to help you make sound personal and business
        decisions.

        We know you are using our site. In April 2000, our main website had
        nearly three million "hits," triple the number who visited two years
        earlier. In May 2001, our Commission website had more than 8.5
        million hits, more than double from the previous year. Hopefully you
        will continue to depend on us for vital, clear and unbiased
        information. Whether you are a student, researcher, a government
        worker, from the news media, or a member of the public in
        general...we hope you will be able to find what you are looking for.

        If you have suggestions, please send them to our web development
        team at energia@energy.ca.gov.

        Thank you again for visiting!


     Keese Signature
