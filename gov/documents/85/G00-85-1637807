   Algerine McCray, Deputy Director, Small Business Advocate and Disabled
   Veteran Business Enterprise Advocate

   Thank you for your interest in participating in the State of California
   Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE), Minority Business Enterprise
   (MBE) and Women Business Enterprise (WBE) program.

   The purpose of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans),
   Civil Rights Program is to increase the level of participation of
   disadvantaged businesses in all Federal contracting activities.
   Pursuant to Federal regulations, to participate in our program,
   qualifying firms must first be certified as a Disadvantaged Business
   Enterprise (DBE) by the Caltrans Civil Rights Program. Firms interested
   in certification as a Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise (DVBE)
   should contact the Department of General Services, Office of Small and
   Minority Business (OSBCR) (916) 322-5060.

   Only small business concerns as defined by the United States Small
   Business Administration which are owned and controlled by one or more
   socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, can be certified
   as a DBE. Owned and controlled means:
     * At least 51 percent of the small business concern is owned by one
       or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals; and
     *  Whose management and daily business operations are controlled by
       one or more of the socially and economically disadvantaged
       individuals who own it.

   An MBE is a small business owned and controlled by one or more
   minorities. Owned and controlled means:
     * At least 51 percent of the small business concern is owned by one
       or more minorities or, in the case of a publicly owned business, at
       least 51 percent of all issued stock is owned by one or more
       minorities; and
     * Whose management and daily business operations are controlled by
       one or more such individuals.

   An WBE is a small business owned and controlled by one or more women.
   Owned and controlled means that:
     * At least 51 percent of the small business concern is owned by one
       or more women; and
     * Whose management and daily business operations are controlled by
       one or more women who own it.

   In order to avoid unnecessary delays, please complete all portions of
   the Application and the attached Personal Net Worth
   Statement/Affidavit. Indicate non-applicable items by using "N/A".
   Copies of documents requested in the questionnaire are required and
   must be submitted. Additional documentation may be requested if it is
   considered necessary to make a certification determination. Incomplete
   applications, or any without the required documents, will not be
   evaluated until such documents are submitted.
