   The Kansas City FBI Community Outreach Program strategy focuses its
   efforts in three general areas: Schools, communities, and the
   workplace. The FBI works in cooperation with other federal, state, and
   local agencies who are striving to provide healthier lifestyles for our
   communities' youth. The FBI realizes that if law enforcement is to
   truly contribute to our nation's fight against crime, drugs, gangs, and
   violence we must formulate partnerships with the communities we are
   sworn to serve and protect.

   The Kansas City Field Office Citizens' Academy is a program with two
   sessions a year, is comprised of business, community and minority
   leaders throughout the Kansas City Metropolitan area. This Academy is
   an eight-week course which meets weekly for three hours. This
   eight-week course is a learning experience in which all topics of the
   FBI and our investigative authority are covered. Topics such as white
   collar crime, domestic terrorism, and health care fraud are some of the
   topics which students learn about. The class receives training on the
   firearms simulator as well as spending a day at the firearms range for
   demonstrations and hands-on experiences with trained firearms
   instructors of the Kansas City Office. Following graduation of the
   Academy, students have the opportunity to join the Citizens' Academy
   Foundation, an organization made up of graduates of the Academy. The
   Foundation enables both the students and the FBI to have continued
   contacts and links with the community, business, and minority arenas.
