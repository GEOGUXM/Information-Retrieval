                         Independent Medical Review
                            Consumer Information

   An Independent Medical Review is a way for doctors and other health
   care professionals outside your HMO to make an independent decision
   about your health care. For example, if an HMO denies you health care
   services on the basis that the service is not medically necessary, you
   can request an Independent Medical Review.

   While every HMO must have their own systems for handling complaints,
   the HMO's medical staff or a network provider usually conducts these
   internally.

   The Department of Managed Health Care's new Independent Medical Review
   process will allow you to bring HMO problems regarding denial of
   treatment and medical care to health care professionals outside your
   HMO.

   [healtiptxt.gif] Understand Cholesterol... At Last

   We've been bombarded with so much complicated and conflicting
   information about cholesterol that it makes the head spin. But before
   you throw up your hands in disgust and dig into a
   four-egg-bacon-cheese-omelet with fries on the side, read this. It's
   important to understand how cholesterol and fat affect your health.

   See CalPERS Health Pages for more information.
