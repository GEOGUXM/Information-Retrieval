   The Mass Layoff Statistics (MLS) program has reports on mass layoff
   actions that result in workers being separated from their jobs. Monthly
   mass layoff numbers are from establishments which have at least 50
   initial claims for unemployment insurance (UI) filed against them
   during a 5-week period. Extended mass layoff numbers (released
   quarterly) are from a subset of such establishments--those where the
   employer indicates that 50 or more people were separated from their
   jobs for at least 31 days.
