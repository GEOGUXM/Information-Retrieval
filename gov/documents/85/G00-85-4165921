   Lower-Emission School Bus Program
     __________________________________________________________________

     The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (Air District) is
     pleased to announce a funding opportunity available to public school
     districts in the Bay Area under the California Air Resources Boards
     (CARB) Lower-Emission School Bus Program. This program provides
     funding to replace or retrofit older school buses to reduce harmful
     emissions of diesel particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen.

     On October 19, 2001, the Air District issued applications for a
     second round of funding for the school bus program. Applications for
     both the school bus replacement program and the particulate matter
     retrofit program are available below.

     If  you have any questions regarding the Lower-Emission School Bus
     Program, please contact Andrea Gordon, Environmental Planner, at
     (415) 749-4940 or agordon@baaqmd.gov.

     More information is also available at
