                           Opinion Retrieval System

                           Pre-Defined Searches
                           Summary Database Search

     Opinions may be searched in two different ways. The first,
     "Pre-Defined Searches", provides fast access to some common searches
     on the summary database. You might use this type of search to stay
     current with recent cases. The second, "Summary Database Search",
     allows you to search for particular judges, dates, and cases more
     easily. (See the "Example Searches" link on the Summary Database
     Search page.)
