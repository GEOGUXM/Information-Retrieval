   WHITE HOUSE STATEMENT ON THE REVIEW OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
   PROTECTION AND CYBER SECURITY

   WASHINGTON, May 9 /U.S. Newswire/ ***** -- The following was released
   today by the White House:

   STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY

   Review of Critical Infrastructure Protection and Cyber Security

   The White House is working with federal agencies and private industry
   to
   prepare a new version of the National Plan for Cyberspace Security and
   Critical Infrastructure Protection, to be completed later this year.
   The Bush
   Administration's National Plan will be prepared in close collaboration
   with
   the private sector and other concerned groups outside of the Federal
   Government. The Department of Commerce's Critical Infrastructure
   Assurance Office is coordinating the efforts of several Federal
   departments
   and agencies which are contributing to the Plan's preparation. Meetings
   have
   been held with representatives of several sectors including banking and
   finance, electric power, rail transportation, oil and gas, state and
   local law
   enforcement, the information technology industry, and
   telecommunications.

   At the same time, the Administration is reviewing how it is organized
   to deal
   with information security issues. A cabinet-level meeting recently
   reviewed
   the issue. Recommendations to the President will be made shortly on
   structuring an integrated approach to the national economic,
   governance, and
   national security aspects of cyber security and critical infrastructure
   protection.

   As the President said in his letter to Congress on March 1, this
   Administration believes critical infrastructure and cyber security are
   issues
   important to the health of the Nation's economy, to the functioning of
   government agencies, to law enforcement, and to national security.
   These
   two initiatives highlight the President's commitment to protecting our
   Nation's critical infrastructure.
