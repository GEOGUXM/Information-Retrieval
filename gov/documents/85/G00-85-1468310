   Weapon Design
   Technologies
   (NIS-9)

      Michael P. Webb
      Group Leader

      Thomas P. Suchocki
      Deputy Group Leader

      NIS-9 applies science and technology available throughout LANL to
      support national agencies concerned with the proliferation of
      technologies that can be used to design weapons with very-large-scale
      effects. The effects can be produced with nuclear, biological,
      chemical, or information science. We support agencies with national
      security objectives for intelligence, defense, energy, and law
      enforcement. Tasking and funding from any agency must be approved by
      the DOE Office of Energy Intelligence.

      In analyzing the threat posed by foreign weapons of mass destruction to
      the U.S. and its interests, NIS-9 uses its technical expertise in the
      review of intelligence data from any source on the extent,
      capabilities, physical assets, and modus operandi of foreign nuclear,
      chemical, and biological weapons programs.
