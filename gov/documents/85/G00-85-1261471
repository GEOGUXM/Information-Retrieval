      3rd District Information
   Missouri's Third Congressional District has it all -- winning
   professional sports teams; the first permanent settlement west of the
   Mississippi in the Louisiana Territory -- one of the oldest permanent
   towns in the Midwest; an archaeological site where mastadon bones have
   been discovered; and world class cultural institutions like the
   Missouri Botanical Garden, the St. Louis Symphony and the St. Louis Art
   Museum. The Third District has canoeing and fishing, biking, hiking and
   running trails, cultural attractions, historic sites and more. Its
   charming urban neighborhoods, bustling suburbs, and fertile rural areas
   with gently rolling hills all welcome residents and visitors alike with
   the midwestern hospitality that is our trademark.

   I hope you will find this page helpful as a starting point for
   exploring the wealth of attractions that Missouri and the Third
   District have to offer. Included are many links to attractions,
   government, and informational sites about the region.
