UEET - Glenn and Langley Research Center Facilities

     The UEET Program will utilize a variety of wind tunnels, component
   test facilities, and high temperature engine materials and structures
   laboratories at both Glenn and Langley Research Centers. For general
   information on the Glenn Research Center Facilities, please contact the
   Community and Media Relations Office or the Facilities Management and
   Planning Office at NASA Glenn to obtain a copy of the Aeropropulsion
   Facilities Brochure.
