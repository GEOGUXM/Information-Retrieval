                       1996 NOTES FROM NATIVE AMERICA

          DARTMOUTH BEGINS TO PAY HISTORIC DEBT

          America's rival Ivy League colleges are not usually given to
          mutual praise. But even Harvard University applauds Dartmouth
          College's enrollment of 150 American Indian undergraduates.

          "They are the pride and envy of the Ivy League," admitted Roger
          Banks, senior admissions officer at Harvard.

          Dartmouth's 150 American Indian undergrads number more than all
          the other Ivy League schools combined.

          American Indian students at Dartmouth comprise more thatn 3
          percent of Dartmouth's undergraduate population of 4,200,
          compared with less than one percent of Harvard's 6,700
          undergraduate students.

          Dartmouth's contingent of Indian students in a way is the
          payback of an historic debt.

          The college owes its founding to Samson Occom, a Mohegan from
          Connecticut, who in 1768 raised 11,000 pounds sterling on a trip
          to England that financed the school's opening the following
          year.

          On his return to America, Occom discovered that the school he
          had campaigned for because it was committed to educating native
          youths, was instead admitting almost exclusively white boys from
          England and New Hampshire. Occom handed the money he had raised
          over to Eleazar Wheelock, Dartmouth founder, but broke all ties
          with the school.

          In the 200 years that followed, up to 1969, only 19 native
          Americans graduated from Dartmouth.

          "We did not meet our charter obligations," says acting Dartmouth
          President James Wright. "There's no doubt the recent native
          recruitment is because of our roots. This college was founded
          for the education of Indians, as well as other youth."

          A progressive Dartmouth president, John Kemeny, kicked off the
          revival in 1970, bringing the movement of new respect for native
          Americans to the school. In the intervening 25 years, 340
          American Indians have graduated from Dartmouth.

          ARE YOU AN INDIAN?

          How often have you heard or said "I'm part Indian"? If you have,
          then some Native American elders have something to teach you. A
          very touching example was told by a physician from Oregon who
          discovered as an adult that he was part Indian. This is his
          story. Listen well:

          Some twenty or more years ago while serving the Mono and
          Chukchanse and Chownumnee communities in the Sierra Nevada, I
          was asked to make a housecall on a Mono elder. She was 81 years
          old and had developed pneumonia after falling on frozen snow
          while bucking up some firewood.

          I was surprised that she had asked for me to come since she had
          always avoided anything to do with the services provided through
          the local agencies. However it seemed that she had decided I
          might be alright because I had helped her grandson through some
          difficult times earlier and had been studying Mono language with
          the 2nd graders at North Fork School.

          She greeted me from inside her house with a Mana' hu, directing
          me into her bedroom with the sound of her voice. She was not
          willing to go to the hospital like her family had pleaded, but
          was determined to stay in her own place and wanted me to help
          her using herbs that she knew and trusted but was too weak to do
          alone. I had learned to use about a dozen native medicinal
          plants by that time, but was inexperienced in using herbs in a
          life or death situation. She eased my fears with her kind eyes
          and gentle voice. I stayed with her for the next two days,
          treating her with herbal medicine (and some vitamin C that she
          agreed to accept).

          She made it through and we became friends. One evening several
          years later, she asked me if I knew my elders. I told her that I
          was half Canadian and half Appalachian from Kentucky. I told her
          that my Appalachian grandfather was raised by his Cherokee
          mother but nobody had ever talked much about that and I didn't
          want anyone to think that I was pretending to be an Indian. I
          was uncomfortable saying I was part Indian and never brought it
          up in normal conversation.

          "What! You're part Indian?" she said. "I wonder, would you point
          to the part of yourself that's Indian. Show me what part you
          mean."

          I felt quite foolish and troubled by what she said, so I
          stammered out something to the effect that I didn't understand
          what she meant. Thankfully the conversation stopped at that
          point. I finished bringing in several days worth of firewood for
          her, finished the yerba santa tea she had made for me and went
          home still thinking about her words.

          Some weeks later we met in the grocery store in town and she
          looked down at one of my feet and said, "I wonder if that foot
          is an Indian foot. Or maybe it's your left ear. Have you figured
          it out yet?"

          I laughed out loud, blushing and stammering like a little kid.
          When I got outside after shopping, she was standing beside my
          pick-up, smiling and laughing. "You know" she said, "you either
          are or you aren't. No such thing as part Indian. It's how your
          heart lives in the world, how you carry yourself. I knew before
          I asked you. Nobody told me. Now don't let me hear you say you
          are part Indian anymore."

          She died last year, but I would like her to know that I've
          heeded her words. And I've come to think that what she did for
          me was a teaching that the old ones tell people like me, because
          others have told me that a Native American elder also said
          almost the same thing to them. I know her wisdom helped me to
          learn who I was that day and her words have echoed in my memory
          ever since. And because of her, I am no longer part Indian, I am
          Indian.

          NATIVE LANGUAGE CLASSES

          Tulsa, OK (AP)

          Sapulpa High School's school board has voted to approve Creek
          and Cherokee language classes for their school district.

          School Superintendent Charles Dotson said, "Our objective
          obviously is to have a rich variety of academic programs for our
          students, but you also have to look at cultural needs. ... With
          12% of our students Native Americans we feel this meets some of
          those needs."

          The district surveyed 185 upper division high school Indian
          students last fall. When asked if they would be interested in
          enrolling in an Indian language class, 86% responded yes. The
          search is beginning for instructors to teach Creek and Cherokee
          Language classes. The curriculum will be created in conjuction
          with the tribes. The school district will offer the classes
          first to Indian students and any remaining openings will be
          filled by non-Indian students.

          Laura Hurd, the director for Indian Education in Sapulpa's
          schools said, "In a lot of homes their native language has been
          lost." "We're trying to get them back in touch with their native
          language."

          Several Oklahoma school districts offer classes in American
          Indian languages. The state Dept. of Education says these Indian
          language classes will meet the high school foreign language
          requirements.

        THIS IS THE NOTE FOR VETERAN'S DAY. IT IS A LITTLE LONG, BUT I
                COULD NOT, OUT OF RESPECT, EDIT IT IN ANY WAY. THANK YOU,
                AND REMEMBER WHY YOU HAVE THE DAY OFF.

   A WARRIOR'S STORY

          siyo from this tsalagi gramma in anishinaabe country,

          this is in response to the many people who have e-mailed their
          moral and spiritual support to my husband, bernard, for speaking
          up and out about the traditional ways of our people and the
          reality of our people today. i thank you all.

          my husband was born and raised in ponsford, minnesota on the
          white earth reservation. he is the grandson of wolf rock and a
          direct descendent of chief may-dway-aush, who the whitemen
          called flatmouth. he lived for a period of time with his
          maternal great-grandfather ahn-da-bi-tung in bravik, minnesota.

          he was educated in the catholic mission school in ponsford where
          he was punished many times for speaking his first language,
          ojibwe. he and his first wife, geraldine stone, did not teach
          their children to speak ojibwe, because they did not want them
          to suffer in the school as they had.

          my husband is a combat veteran who served two tours of duty in
          korea. during those two tours he was wounded 5 times in
          hand-to-hand combat and by mortar fire. he and pete spotted wolf
          of the sioux nation were m.i.a.(missing in action) surrounded by
          enemy soldiers they hid in a cave for two weeks where they both
          froze their feet.

          in november of 1951, on the day after thanksgiving, a mortar
          exploded over the bunker he was sleeping in, causing the tons of
          rock and dirt over him to cave in, crushing his face. after
          being in a coma for monthes he had to be taught to talk again,
          in english.

          he served his country proudly and although, he was discharged
          with a disability rating due to his combat wounds, he was not
          awarded purple heart citations from the united states government
          until 35 years later. he has never received credit from the u.s.
          government for single handedly capturing an enemy platoon. he
          was evacuated after getting the end of his thumb shot off,
          taking a rifle away from an enemy soldier in hand-to-hand
          combat. the powers that be assumed that when comrades stated
          that 'rock captured the platoon,' they were referring to a south
          korean soldier who were called 'r.o.k.' this is the same reason
          that the purple heart citations came 35 years late.

          my husband suffers from post traumatic stress disorder from his
          combat experiences. he is haunted by the spirits of the
          warriors: thenorth koreans that he killed in combat and the
          comrades who died fighting beside him in the battlefields. for
          many years he drank alcohol to keep the nightmares away. when he
          quit drinking over ten years ago, the nightmares returned. in
          1991 he graduated from the first all native american p.t.s.d.
          treatment program at american lake vets hospital in tacoma,
          washington. three years ago he completed veterans service
          officer training. he does outreach and advocacy for native
          american veterans suffering from war traumas, helping them and
          their families understand p.t.s.d. and to apply for the benefits
          and assistance that they are entitled to. he does not receive
          any pay to do this, this is how he honors the memory of the
          warriors who did not return from the battlefields.

          bernard is enrolled on his mother's side in the leech lake
          pillager band. when we moved to the leech lake reservation four
          years ago, we were viewed as outsiders by many of the people who
          were raised here all their lives. this is one of the most
          damaging of the legacies of the american holocaust and the
          politics of u.s. federal indian policy, the divisions and
          separations between our own peoples.

          between us, bernard and i have 33 grandchildren and 4
          great-grandchildren; and although the domineering culture tries
          to define and catagorize our family, we are family. we are not
          blended; there are no half children (all our children are
          whole); and we never 'step' on or over any of our children... we
          are family. geraldine stone rock has passed on to the spirit
          world and i am the only gramma rock many of these children will
          know. as grandparents we watch over the 'education' of the
          children... our grandchildren, our nieces and nephews, all the
          children in our community... because that _is_ our job.

          our family has been through much for many generations. we cannot
          go back and change the hurts of the past, but through our
          grandchildren we can heal by making life better for them. we
          believe that better life can be secured by honoring the struggle
          and the strength of our ancestors and returning to their
          traditional values and priorties.

          our ancestors were resourceful and creative peoples. they made
          the most of what was available to them. they adapted to their
          environments in a way that was good for the people and
          respectful to the gifts of thecreator. this is how we view
          cyberspace and we chuckle at the mysterious coincidence that
          this tool of communication is available through an invisible
          entity called a world wide web.

          it is not our intention to offend anyone and we apologize to
          those who take offense at any of our words. and to you
          non-native people who truly are empathetic and concerned about
          our people, we need to say, that sometimes the best support that
          you can give us is to stand back quietlyand let our voice be
          heard.

          i thank you for listening to this gramma.

          feather eaglerock, leech lake rez

          Chris Simon: Feature Profile [chrispro.jpg]

          Band/Nation: Ojibwa

          Place of Birth: Wawa, Ontario

          Date of Birth: January 30, 1972

          Curent Team: Colorado Avalanche, #12

          Position: Left Wing

          Ht/Wt: 6'3", 219

          Chris Simon isnt your ordinary goon. Although he has earned the
          reputation as one of the toughest, if not THE toughest fighters
          in the NHL, he has really blossomed this season into a very
          valuable player. Although injuries kept him out of much of the
          playoffs, specifically a nagging ankle injury, he was able to
          get a few points. There has been speculation in Denver that
          Colorado will not try to retain Simon (He is a Type II free
          agent) due to a run-in with coach Marc Crawford early in the
          playoffs. However, Colorado Avalanche managment has stated they
          intend on trying to re-sign all their players. One thing for
          sure, he wil be a very valuable assest to whatever team he ends
          up on.

          Although Chris missed the first several games of the season due
          to contract dispute, and sat out occasional games with back and
          shoulder injuries, he had 16 goals and 16 assists in the regular
          season. He has surprisingly good hands for such a big guy, and
          is so strong it is nearly impossible to move him in front of the
          net. Additionally, he is a hard worker and a team leader, as
          well as one of the most popular Avalanche among his teammates.

          Since he broke into the league 3 years ago, Simon has been
          highly regarded by the Native American community, especially as
          a role model for Native youth. He is a recovering alcoholic,
          hopes that he is a positive example for Native kids to follow.
          Chris has said that he likes to spend his free time hunting and
          fishing, which he feels is much healthier than hanging out at a
          bar. Upon retiring from hockey, he would like to return to his
          home in Ontario and live a small town lifestyle.

          (NOTE; IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AVALANCHE DID NOT SIGN
          CHRIS UP FOR ANOTHER SEASON!)

          Learning from the Ancestors

          Traditional agricultural methods are being taught to help tribal
          families make use of their own land, increase self-sufficiency,
          and preserve cultural traditions.

          The program for this was developed by the Thakiwa Foundation
          which is an independant non-profit group which maintains offices
          in Drumright and Prague Oklahoma.

          The agricultural program, and projects, was started in the
          Springof 1996 near Cushing, Oklahoma. Dagmar Thorpe, director of
          Thakiwa, is the great-granddaughter of Olympic athlete Jim
          Thorpe. She said, "We want to perpetuate our way of life, our
          language and our culture. Our principal focus is our own
          community, the Sac and Fox, but we're also linking with people
          in other places and providing some assistance."

          Thakiwa Deputy Director, Jacob Manatowa-Bailey has studied what
          types of plantings were done by tribal ancestors and how they
          were planted. Land management practices are also included, to
          help with wild life habitat.

          Jim Wilson, a tribal member, experimented with different
          planting methods in his garden this year. He tried planting corn
          in single rows, and in another garden, planted with the
          traditional "three sisters" method.

          In this method you plant corn in mounds and two weeks later
          plant pole beans on the mounds and squash and pumpkins in
          between the mounds. The squash and pumpkin's broad leaves keep
          weeds down, the corn acts like poles for the beans, and the
          beans fertilize the corn.

          Comparing the harvest, Wilson said the row corn gave one ear per
          stalk, and the three sisters method gave three or four ears per
          stalk.The program participants are going to use their harvest in
          four ways, as their ancestors did. The harvest will be used to
          feed the family, to give away to others, to save some for
          ceremonial purposes, and for feasts.

          11/04/96

          It's hard to imagine that it has been a year since I began
          sending you Notes from Native America during the month of
          November. Last year I was somewhat overwhelmed, but certainly
          gratified, by all the response they received. 1996 brings us an
          additional outlet, the American Indian Program Council (AIPC)
          homepage on the Internet, where the Notes will be posted for all
          the world to see.

          For those of you unfamiliar with the Notes from Native America,
          last year, in an effort to raise awareness during Native
          American Heritage month with zero money, I put out e-mails on
          the office WAN (nearly) every day which presented, either
          historical or contemporary, "a glimpse into America as
          experienced by its indigenous people.

          This year it may be somewhat intermittent, but there is still
          plenty to share, and a lot more to explore. I'm hoping that many
          more of you will have Internet capabilities and Netscape this
          year, so you can investigate Native websites of interest. If
          there is something you would like to see, let me know, and
          perhaps I can help find it and put it up to share. Sampling
          Native poetry and literature is something I look forward to
          doing.

          The foremost thing in my mind at the moment is the one-day
          training seminar our AIPC has been busily planning for months.
          It will be held in Denver at the Tivoli Center on November 19.
          Elizabeth Homer, director of the US Office of American Indian
          Trust will be our keynote speaker, and we have many respected
          individuals presenting sessions. If you have Mosaic or Netscape
          you can read all about it at:
