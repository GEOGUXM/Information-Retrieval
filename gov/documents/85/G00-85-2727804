     __________________________________________________________________

   Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction of electromagnetic
   radiation with matter. Instruments like spectrometers use prisms or
   other devices to split radiation into various wavelengths. Atmospheric
   spectroscopy uses these and other instruments to gain an understanding
   of the composition of our atmosphere.

   Electromagnetic radiation includes not only visible light, but infrared
   radiation, microwaves, radio waves, ultraviolet light, and X-rays.
   Because this radiation takes the form of waves, scientists and
   engineers use the characteristics of wavelength or frequency to
   distinguish the various types of radiation. The highest-energy
   radiation has the highest frequency and the shortest wavelength. A
   spectrum shows the intensity of radiation received by a detector at
   each wavelength or frequency. The spectrum can be shown as an image on
   a photographic plate or as a graph of intensity vs.frequency. The
   features of the spectrum depend on the characteristics of the light
   source and on the nature of the matter between the source and the
   detector.

   Molecules in the gas phase absorb and emit radiation mainly at
   frequencies from the microwave to the visible. Each molecule has a
   unique spectrum which is determined by the types and arrangement of
   atoms in the molecule.And since molecules are merely building blocks
   for substances,the spectrum of a molecule can identify the type of
   substance to which it belongs.

   A spectrum of the atmosphere can be recorded by an instrument on the
   ground or an instrument carried by a satellite, balloon, or aircraft.
   Atmospheric scientists can study the spectrum to determine the types
   and amounts of molecules present in the atmosphere at the time and
   place the spectrum was recorded. This is a difficult task, very much
   like examining the fingerprints on a cookie jar to find out who has
   taken the cookies. It is important to have laboratory measurements of
   the spectrum of each molecule to compare to the spectrum of the
   atmosphere, which is a mixture of many molecules. With these
   measurements as a guide, determinations can be made concerning the
   makeup of the atmosphere.
