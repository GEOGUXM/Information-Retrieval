   Rivers draining the Chugach, Kenai, and Talkeetna  Mountains and the
   Alaska Range are showing streamflow  ranging from 30 to 100 percent
   above  long-term median streamflows. Streamflow for Kenai River at
   Cooper Landing (Figure 1), Sixmile Creek near Hope, Moose Creek near
   Palmer, and Matanuska River at Palmer  (Figure 2) are about double the
   long term median streamflow. Water-levels continue to rise because of
   melting snow from the recent warm weather. There is still abundant
   snowpack in these areas. The National Weather Service River Forecast
   Center has issued flood statements for the Kenai River at Cooper
   Landing, Skwentna,  and Yentna Rivers.

   The Kenai River hasnÂ’t experienced June streamflow at Cooper Landing
   this high since 1953 (figure 1). Streamflow on June 29, 1953 reached
   19,900 cubic feet per second (cfs), likely the result of similar deep
   snow and warm temperatures. Other daily flows greater than 18,000 cfs
   were the result of late-summer rainfall (September 1, 1967) or glacial
   outburst (September 21. 1974). The September 1995 floods reached a peak
   of 20,300 cfs at Cooper Landing, but were larger downstream.
