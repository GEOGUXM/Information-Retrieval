   Investigators who have no need of additional funding can request access
   to the facilities of CIDR by submitting a CIDR Access Application for
   review by the CIDR Access Committee (CAC). The deadlines for submitting
   an application are:


                                     March 1


                                     July 1


                                     November 1

   Investigators applying for NIH grant funding to pay for collecting
   phenotype data, DNA samples, or (if applicable) CIDR genotyping
   charges, may include CIDR services as a component of their research
   plan. In this case, investigators should submit their CIDR Access
   Application at least three to four months prior to submitting the
   research grant application to the NIH so they can learn the outcome of
   CIDR's review process prior to the review of their NIH grant
   application. The following schedule should be used to guide
   investigators in preparing and submitting requests for CIDR access.
   Requests for access received too late to transmit to the CAC members
   will be held and taken to the next CAC meeting.

   The CIDR Board of Governors will review the reommendations of the CAC
   and determine which projects get accepted for genotyping at CIDR. If a
   project is accepted, a letter of commitment will be sent to the
   investigator so it may be attached to a grant application or be
   forwarded to an Initial Review Group (IRG) prior to its meeting.
