   Happy Navigators Prepare to Say "Goodnight and Goodbye" to Odyssey's
   Successful Aerobraking
   With the successful completion of the aerobraking effort, the Odyssey
   navigation team is leaving a legacy of well-honed interdisciplinary
   tools and techniques certain to be used on future missions using
   aerobraking. [MORE...]

   Robotic Workers
   NASA researchers have successfully demonstrated the first use of
   multiple rovers that work tightly in sync to perform tasks such as
   coordinated grasping, lifting and moving of an extended payload, while
   navigating through obstacles on natural terrain. [MORE...]

   New Rover Design Videos
   NASA researchers are developing new prototype robots that can drive up
   steep hills and descend almost-vertical cliffs. Working alone or as a
   team, these autonomous robotic explorers may go where no rover has gone
   before -- the cliffs of Mars.

   Machinists to the Stars
   It's the middle of the night at JPL, and the usual dozens of deer are
   on their nightly foraging rounds across the campus. Mars is up. So is
   the Moon. And so are nine machinists in the lab's high-precision
   fabrication shop, working the second shift that ends between midnight
   and 3 a.m. They are part of the round-the-clock team turning out
   odd-shaped pieces of metal that will become robots destined for Mars.

   Mars Orbit Insertion
   Experience a computer-generated animation of the Odyssey spacecraft on
   its voyage to the red planet. This animation covers its journey from
   Earth to Mars, Orbit Insertion, and Aerobraking.

   Orbit Insertion
   Getting to Mars is difficult enough -- staying there is even more
   challenging. Odyssey met up with Mars on October 24 02:26 UTC (October
   23: 7:26 p.m. PDT/10:26 p.m.EDT). That's when the spacecraft executed
   an engine firing that slowed it down (relative to Mars) and allowed
   Odyssey to be captured into orbit around Mars. In this final episode,
   Odyssey team members explain their rigorous preparations for the event.

   NASA TV will begin coverage at 7 p.m. PDT October 23.

   Telecommunications
   How do you converse with a robot nearly one hundred million miles away?
   In this video, Odyssey team members describe communications with the
   2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft using the antennas of the Deep Space
   Network.

   Interplanetary Cruise
   At the time this video was released, the Odyssey team had successfully
   completed the third trajectory correction maneuver to adjust the
   spacecraft's flightpath toward its final aimpoint for entry into Mars
   orbit. In the second installment of a four-part video series, The
   Challenges of Getting to Mars, Odyssey navigation team members discuss
   the challenges of flying from Earth to Mars.

   Aerobraking
   The Odyssey spacecraft was launched toward Mars on April 7, 2001 from
   Cape Canaveral, Florida. In this four-part video series, Odyssey
   navigation team members explain the daily challenges of steering a
   spacecraft 93 million miles from Earth to Mars.

   The first episode describes the intense aerobraking phase, which begins
   two days after the spacecraft arrives at Mars (Mars Orbit Insertion,
   October 24, 2001). From then on, navigation team members still have
   three months of difficult maneuvering to do in order to slow the
   spacecraft down and bring Odyssey into its circular science mapping
   orbit. Using atmospheric drag to "aerobrake," the spacecraft dips into
   the Martian atmosphere once every time the spacecraft swings by its
   closest approach to Mars.

   Future episodes discuss the hostile conditions the spacecraft
   encounters on its journey to Mars, the challenges of communicating with
   a distant spacecraft, and the upcoming critical event: Mars Orbit
   Insertion.

   Fourth of July Tribute to Pathfinder
   Four years ago, on July 4, 1997, Mars Pathfinder bounced in airbags to
   a safe landing on the red planet. A tremendous success, the mission
   lasted three times longer than expected, with the Sojourner rover
   operating 12 times its design lifetime of seven days. Little Sojourner
   was the first free-ranging robotic rover to operate on the surface of
   another planet. With Sojourner's help, the mission returned 2.3 billion
   bits of information, including more than 16,500 images from the lander
   and 550 images from the rover. From this information, we learned that
   Mars probably had liquid water on its surface long ago. View our
   tribute video in RealPlayer format.

   Journey to Mars
   Is there water on Mars? Where might there have been life? What do we
   know about Mars, and what are we trying to find out? Take this Journey
   to Mars with Dr. Dan McCleese, Mars Chief Scientist, as he narrates
   this multimedia presentation on the past, present and future of Mars
   exploration. Available in a 3.5 MB Flash 4, or QuickTime 5 file. It
   will take approximately ten minutes to download on a 56k modem.
