   Background

     * B.S. Chemistry, University of California, Los Angeles (1981-1985)

   Research
   My research uses theoretical and computational approaches to study
   biomolecules. This includes studies of solvent effects, conformational
   flexibility, and enzyme-substrate binding. An additional area of
   research involves the development of potential models which are more
   accurate, containing polarizability, yet still have the same
   computational efficiency as simpler models. This research has provided
   insight into protein stability, drug resistance in HIV and the
   catalytic mechanism of enzymes linked to cancer.
