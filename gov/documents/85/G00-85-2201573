                         U.S. Copyright Office Forms

     Copyright Office application forms are available in PDF format and
     are best viewed with the latest, free Adobe Acrobat Reader program.
     Fill-in versions may be completed online and then printed. To save
     forms, you must use the full version of Adobe Acrobat.

     Forms submitted to the Copyright Office must be clear, legible, and
     on good quality 8.5-inch by 11-inch white paper. The office produces
     completed registration certificates by scanning the submitted
     applications. Thus, poorly printed applications will result in
     poor-quality registration certificates.

     Important Printing Instructions:
     * Print forms head to head (top of page 2 is directly behind the top
       of page 1).
     * Use BOTH SIDES of a single sheet of paper. (Note: Short forms are
       one-sided.)
     * Dot-matrix printer copies are not acceptable.
     * Inkjet printer copies require enlarging if you use the Shrink to
       Fit Page option.
     * To achieve best results, use a Laser Printer.
     * For more information, read Printing Solutions for PDF forms.

     The forms below may also be downloaded from our FTP site. In
     addition, you may request Forms by Mail.

     NOTE: Filing fees are effective through June 30, 2002. After that date,
     please check this website or call (202) 707-3000 for the latest fee
     information.
