   __________________________________________________________________

     Measurement of atmospheric ozone using a balloon-borne
     Electro-Chemical Concentration Cell (ECC) Ozonesonde consists of an
     ozone pump interfaced to a digital radiosonde. Data measured by the
     flight instrument are transmitted to a ground receiving station
     consisting of an antenna, receiver, digital filter bank, and a
     personal computer for real-time data collection and processing. The
     digital ECC ozonesonde instrument and the ground data processing
     software provide measurement parameters including ozone partial
     pressure, ozone mixing ratio, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric
     temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and
     geometric height.

  Ascension Island

   Title:

            Ascension Island Ozone Measurements

   Sponsor:

            NASA

   Location:

            Ascension Island (Latitude: 7.98°S, Longitude: 14.42°W)

   Dates:

            commencing July 1997

     It is planned to establish a measurement program at this site to
     collect a series of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone
     measurements from this Equatorial Atlantic location. Data collection
     is expected to begin in July 1997..

     The Ascension Island data will be made available in the World Ozone
     and Ultraviolet Data Center (WOUDC) archive at a later date. Contact
     WOUDC for flight data from this campaign when it becomes available.
     If you have questions regarding the Ascension Island data, please
     contact the UAIRP P.I..

            Natal, Brazil
            [1] - (Latitude: 5.92°S, Longitude: 35.17°W, Height: 15 m);
            [2] - (Latitude: 5.49°S, Longitude: 35.26°W, Height: 14 m)

   Dates:

            [1] - December 1990 -- December 12, 2001;
            [2] - December 13, 2001 --

                                     NOTICE!
      On December 13, 2001, ozone measurements no longer are being made from
     the Natal site located at 05.92°S, 035.17°W, and 15 meters. Please note
     the location of the new launch site at 05.49°S, 035.26°W, and 14
     meters. If more information is desired, contact
              the INPE Principal Investigator, Dr. Volker W.J.H. Kirchoff.

     Data from Natal, Brazil, are obtained under a Memorandum of
     Understanding between the National Aeronautics and Space
     Administration (NASA) and the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas
     Espaciais (INPE) in Brazil. The measurement site is operated by Dr.
     V.W.J.H. Kirchhoff, INPE, Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil. Since
     mid-1995, balloon-borne digital ECC ozonesondes have been deployed.
     Prior to 1995 analog ozonesondes were used. A weekly measurement
     schedule was originally planned. However, operational considerations
     have caused fewer than anticipated measurements to be gathered. The
     Natal measurements support investigation of the equatorial
     tropospheric and stratospheric ozone as well as providing
     correlative measurements to the HALOE instrument on the UARS
     satellite.

     Natal data are available in plot form through the Data Catalog Link
     below. The Natal, Brazil measurement data will be made available in
     the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Center (WOUDC) archive in 1997.
     Contact WOUDC for flight data from this site when it becomes
     available. If you have questions regarding the Natal, Brazil data,
     please contact the UAIRP P.I. or Dr. Kirchhoff at INPE.

   Dates:

            April 26, 1996 -- May 10, 1996

     SONDEX96 was a joint NASA/SMI campaign conducted at the Swiss
     Meteorological Institute (SMI) in Payerne, Switzerland. The Swiss
     Meteorological Institute instruments included an experimental Brewer
     MAST ozonesonde instrument modified with an ECC pump, and the
     typical Brewer MAST instrument. NASA GSFC used ECC ozonesonde
     instruments.
     The ozonesondes were flown in a triple configuration on standard
     meteorological balloons provided by SMI. A summary of the various
     flights and instrument configurations is included in the data
     catalog.

     SONDEX96 measurements are available in plot form through the Data
     Catalog Link below. The Payerne, Switzerland, SONDEX96 data will NOT
     BE made available in the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Center
     (WOUDC) archive until the completion of the experiment Research
     Reports. If you have questions regarding the SONDEX96 data, please

   Location:

            NASA Goddard Space Flight Center / Wallops Flight Facility
            Wallops Island, Virginia (Latitude: 37.9°N, Longitude: 75.5°W)

   Dates:

            January 1970 -- present

     NASA has been conducting ozonesonde measurements from Wallops Island
     since 1970. The digital ECC ozonesonde replaced the analog ECC
     ozonesonde during 1994. Nominal one-per-week balloon-borne
     ozonesondes are released from the Wallops Flight Facility each
     Wednesday. Additional observations are conducted in support of
     various aircraft, missile, and satellite projects including the
     UARS/HALOE spacecraft and instrument system.

     The GSFC/Wallops Flight Facility ozonesonde measurements are
     available in plot form, for ONLY the CURRENT and PREVIOUS years,
     through the Data Catalog Link below. Earlier data may be obtained
     from the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Center (WOUDC). Contact
     WOUDC for the more recent flight data from this site when it becomes
