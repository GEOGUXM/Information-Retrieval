   Our partnership shares the exciting discoveries and knowledge from NASA
   Sun-Earth Connection missions and research programs with educators,
   students, and the general public. The Sun-Earth Connection Education
   Forum (SECEF) partnership brings together the rich expertise of
   scientists, educators, and museums to develop innovative products and
   programs.

   Our goal is to increase science literacy and focus attention on the
   active Sun and its effects on Earth.
