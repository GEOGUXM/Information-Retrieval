                                 Satellites

   Satellite remote sensing offers a unique and powerful method for
   providing observations of the Earth's oceanic, atmospheric and
   terrestrial environments. One category of satellites used for this
   purpose is referred to as polar-orbiting satellites. These satellites
   are placed in a relatively low Earth orbit (~800 km) and circle the
   Earth about every 90 minutes. They are equipped with a number of
   sensors that provide observations of radiation emitted/scattered from
   the ocean/atmosphere/land system that can be used to derive a number of
   important environmental quantities. Depending on the exact satellite
   orbit and sensor characteristics, each area of the Earth is observed
   about twice per day (more frequently in high latitudes) at horizontal
   resolutions that vary from about 1 km to about 50 km. The National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) maintains a fleet of
   polar-orbiting satellites in order to provide timely measurements of
   evolving atmospheric and oceanic conditions. The most widely used
   environmental sensors on these satellites include the Advanced Very
   High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Advanced Tiros Operational
   Vertical Sounder (ATOVS). The AVHRR is a high-resolution (1 km),
   multi-channel visible and infrared radiometer used for analyzing cloud
   variability and heights, deriving sea surface temperature (SST), land
   vegetation indices, and total outgoing longwave radiation. TOVS is a
   moderate resolution (~30km), multi-channel infrared and microwave
   radiometer that provides estimates of temperature and moisture profiles
   of the atmosphere, ocean surface wind speed, as well as column
   precipitable and liquid water. In addition to the satellites operated
   by NOAA, there are also research environmental satellites sponsored by
   the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). One such
   example, is Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) which
   measures ocean color in order to derive high-resolution (1 km)
   distributions of phytoplankton and sediment concentrations. In
   addition, SeaWiFS data can be used for estimating atmospheric aerosol
   amounts. Due to the unique measurement characteristics of these
   sensors, along with their relatively homogeneous and routine sampling,
   these remotely sensed data have become invaluable to the environmental
   sciences communities.

   Data from polar-orbiting satellites are typically communicated back to
   Earth in two ways. One involves storing a full day's worth of data
   (i.e., the full globe), often at a reduced resolution, on board the
   satellite and dumping it all at once over specific high-capacity
   downlink stations. The second way involves broadcasting the data that
   is currently being observed, in its complete/high-resolution form,
   directly back to Earth in real-time. Thus a real-time ground station
   can receive data for any area the satellite passes over in which there
   is an unobstructed "line-of-sight" between the receiving dish and the
   orbiting satellite. For example, the upper-left panel of Figure 1 shows
   the local region that could be indirectly "observed" via a receiving
   station located on Long Island for three different local horizon limits
   (e.g., trees/buildings obstructions). As is evident from the figure,
   this station could obtain real-time data for the entire eastern
   seaboard region and beyond. Having access to these data will support a
   number of a number of educational programs, research studies and
   operational projects that are currently underway and/or planned for the
   future by scientists at SUNY and BNL.
