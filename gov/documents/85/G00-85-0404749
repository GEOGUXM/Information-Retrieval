   Welcome to the home page of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water
   Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program's Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint
   (ACF) River basin study.

   The long-term goals of this program are to describe the status and
   trends in the quality of a large, representative part of the Nation's
   surface- and ground-water resources, and to provide a sound, scientific
   understanding of the primary factors affecting the quality of these
   resources.
