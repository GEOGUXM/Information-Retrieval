   The United States District Court holds civil, criminal and grand jury
   cases and its jurisdiction includes areas of the state near Atlanta,
   Gainesville, Newnan and Rome. For most people, the opportunity to serve
   in Federal Court comes but once in a lifetime. If you have received a
   summons or would like to attend a trial, please refer to the Frequently
   Asked Questions link below.

   JUROR FEES are paid at the rate of $40.00 per day that a juror reports,
   plus mileage and parking. Juror attendance are computed automatically.
   Please save all parking and travel receipts and submit them at the end
   of your two(2) week term. Staple all receipts together in date order.
   Print your full name and summons date on the back of each receipt.
