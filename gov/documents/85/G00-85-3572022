   The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a federal law that allows any
   person the right to obtain federal agency records unless the records
   (or part of the records) are protected from disclosure by any of the
   lawÂ’s exemptions. On October 2, 1996, the President signed into law the
   Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 (E-FOIA).
   E-FOIA will make it possible for individuals to have electronic access
   to certain NAD information without filing a formal FOIA request.
