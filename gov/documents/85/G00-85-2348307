   STATE OF CALIFORNIA GRAY DAVIS, Governor COMMISSION ON TEACHER
   CREDENTIALING 1900 Capitol Avenue Sacramento, California 95814-4213
   (916) 445-0184 OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR December 21, 2001 Dear
   Colleague: Enclosed is a Request for Proposals (RFP) for development
   and administration of subject matter examinations for prospective
   California teachers. I sincerely hope that you will consider submitting
   a proposal for this work. If you know of any other potential bidders
   who might be interested in submitting a proposal, please share the RFP
   with them, or ask them to contact Chris Gramith (916-445- 0229;
   cgramith@ctc.ca.gov) to request their own copy. Purpose of the RFP The
   California Commission on Teacher Credentialing issues teaching
   credentials. One of the requirements for a teaching credential is
   competence in the subject(s) in which the credential authorizes
   instruction. California law provides two optional ways of meeting the
   subject matter competence requirement. Credential candidates can either
   (a) complete a Commission-approved subject matter program at a college
   or university or (b) pass one or more examinations adopted by the
   Commission for this purpose. The Commission strives to make these two
   options as equivalent as possible. The purpose of this RFP is to secure
   a contractor to develop and administer new subject matter examinations
   for prospective teachers who choose to meet the subject matter
   competence requirement by taking exams. Exams are needed for all
   credential areas. Overview of the RFP Part 1 of the RFP is a summary.
   Part 2 of the RFP provides background information relevant to the work
   to be performed by the contractor. Part 3 describes the scope of work
   for which the contractor will be responsible. Part 4 provides
   information about the contract that the Commission expects to enter
   into as a result of this RFP, including information about financial
   arrangements. Part 5 describes proposal organization and content
   requirements, and Part 6 describes the proposal review process, the
   criteria against which proposals will be evaluated, and the process for
   selection of a contractor. Submitting a Proposal The Commission looks
   forward to receiving proposals from a variety of bidders with
   appropriate experience and expertise. Each proposal will be evaluated
   on the basis of criteria specified in the enclosed RFP. Subject Matter

   ... 37 iv PART 1 SUMMARY The California Commission on Teacher
   Credentialing issues teaching credentials. One of the requirements for
   a teaching credential is competence in the subject(s) in which the
   credential authorizes instruction. California law provides two optional
   ways of meeting the subject matter competence requirement. Credential
   candidates can either (a) complete a Commission- approved subject
   matter program at a college or university or (b) pass one or more
   examinations adopted by the Commission for this purpose. The Commission
   strives to make these two options as equivalent as possible. The
   purpose of this RFP is to secure a contractor to develop and administer
   new subject matter examinations for prospective teachers who choose to
   meet the subject matter competence requirement by taking exams. Exams
   are needed for all credential areas. This includes a new examination
   for prospective elementary teachers. This examination will include the
   following subject areas: * reading, language, and literature * history
   and social science * science * mathematics * physical education *
   visual and performing arts * human development Content specifications
   for this exam have been developed and adopted by the Commission. They
   are available at www.ctc.ca.gov/SB2042/SB2042_info.html. In addition,
   new examinations in the following thirteen subject areas are needed for
   prospective secondary teachers: * English * mathematics * science
   (including subtests in general science, biology, chemistry, Earth and
   space science, and physics) * social science * physical education * art
   * music * languages other than English * agriculture * business *
   health science * home economics * industrial and technology education
   Content specifications for the English, mathematics, science, and
   social science exams are under development at this time. A validity
   study of the preliminary specifications (called "subject matter
   requirements," or SMRs) is in process. The preliminary specifications
   are available at www.ctc.ca.gov. It is expected that the Commission
   will adopt final versions in April 2002. The contractor will develop
   and validate content specifications for the remaining exams for
   Commission adoption. 1 The contractor will also develop and then
   administer a new Preliminary Educational Technology (PET) examination.
   The contract term will be from approximately March 2002 through October
   2006, and will include test administrations through June 2006. The new
   elementary subject matter examination, and the new exams in English,
   mathematics, science, and social science, are to be ready for initial
   administration approximately half way through the 2002-03 testing
   year.1 Exams in physical education, art, music, and languages other
   than English, and the new PET exam, are to be ready for initial
   administration approximately half way through the 2003-04 testing year.
   The remaining exams are to be ready for initial administration
   approximately half way through the 2004-05 testing year. Part 2 of this
   RFP provides background information relevant to the work to be
   performed by the contractor. Part 3 describes the scope of work for
   which the contractor will be responsible. Part 4 provides information
   about the contract that the Commission expects to enter into as a
   result of this RFP, including information about financial arrangements.
   Part 5 describes proposal organization and content requirements, and
   Part 6 describes the proposal review process, the criteria against
   which proposals will be evaluated, and the process for selection of a
   contractor. 1 A testing year is from July 1 through June 30. 2 PART 2
   BACKGROUND INFORMATION This part of the RFP provides background
   information about the project. The primary participants, California
   teaching credentials, the subject matter competence requirement for
   teaching credentials, the exams currently used by the Commission,
   California's K-12 student content standards, related work completed or
   in progress, and data about the California teaching population are
   discussed. Primary Participants Besides the contractor, the primary
   participants in the work described in this RFP will be the California
   Commission on Teacher Credentialing and its project officer, subject
   matter advisory panels, and Bias Review Committee. Each of these
   participants is described below. The California Commission on Teacher
   Credentialing In 1970, the California Legislature and Governor created
   a permanent, independent commission to improve the effectiveness of
   teachers and teacher education in the state. Originally named the
   Commission for Teacher Preparation and Licensing, the agency was
   renamed the Commission on Teacher Credentialing in 1983. Five years
   later, in 1988, the Legislature and Governor enacted new legislation
   that strengthened the Commission's autonomy as the state's primary
   policymaking body for the education profession, and expanded its legal
   and regulatory authority. The primary purpose of the Commission's
   policymaking and other leadership activities is to improve teaching and
   learning for students in California's schools. The Commission sets
   standards and awards professional credentials to those who meet its
   standards, the majority of whom are prepared in California colleges and
   universities. The Commission is composed of fifteen voting members and
   four non-voting members. The voting members include fourteen members
   appointed by the Governor and a representative of the State
   Superintendent of Public Instruction. The gubernatorial appointees
   include six teachers, one school administrator, one school counselor or
   other services credential holder, one teacher educator in postsecondary
   education, one school board member, and four members of the general
   public. The four non-voting members are representatives appointed by
   the University of California, the California State University, the
   Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities, and
   the California Postsecondary Education Commission. The Commission meets
   publicly approximately monthly, eleven times per year. The Commission's
   staff prepares an agenda for each meeting. Most agenda items are
   "action items" requiring a decision by the Commission. All major policy
   proposals are presented to the Commission for its discussion and
   adoption. For example, the content specifications developed by the
   contractor, as well as recommended passing standards for the exams,
   will be presented to the Commission for their consideration and
   adoption. The Commission's Project Officer Dr. Nicole A. Amador,
   Consultant, of the Examinations and Research Unit, Professional
   Services Division, will be the Commission's Project Officer. The
   Project Officer will be the principal Commission staff member with whom
   the contractor will interact during the term of 3 the contract. The
   Project Officer will serve as liaison between (a) the contractor and
   (b) the Commission, its executive management, its staff with assessment
   expertise, its subject matter advisory panels, and its Bias Review
   Committee. The Project Officer, or her designee, will monitor the
   contractor's work, especially for the quality of services/products and
   adherence to performance deadlines. All materials developed and
   services provided by the contractor will be subject to the review and
   approval of the Project Officer or her designee. The Commission's
   Subject Matter Advisory Panels and Bias Review Committee The Commission
   has appointed some and will appoint other subject matter advisory
   panels to provide subject matter expertise and guidance to the
   contractor. These panels, as well as the Commission's Bias Review
   Committee, will participate in test development as described in Part 3A
   of this RFP. Elementary Subject Matter Advisory Panel In 1998, the
   Commission's Executive Director appointed the Elementary Subject Matter
   Advisory Panel to develop program standards and content specifications
   for the subject matter requirement for prospective elementary teachers.
   The 23 currently active panel members include California elementary
   school teachers, principals, curriculum specialists, teacher educators,
   and college faculty members with expertise in the seven content areas
   required by law (history/social science; human development;
   mathematics; physical education; reading, language, and literacy;
   science; and visual and performing arts). As described in Part 3A, the
   contractor will assist the Commission in augmenting this panel to a
   total of 35 active members (five in each of the seven subject areas on
   the test). Subject Matter Advisory Panels for English, Mathematics,
   Science, and Social Science In 2001, the Commission's Executive
   Director appointed four subject matter advisory panels, one each for
   English, mathematics, science, and social science. These panels, with
   16, 13, 16, and 15 active members, respectively, have been meeting
   since March 2001 developing program standards and subject matter
   requirements (content specifications) for prospective secondary
   teachers. They include California teachers, teacher educators, and
   curriculum specialists with expertise in the subject area. Subject
   Matter Advisory Panels for the Remaining Areas The Commission's
   Executive Director will appoint nine additional subject matter advisory
   panels, one each for: * physical education * art * music * languages
   other than English * agriculture * business * health science * home
   economics * industrial and technology education As described in Part 3A
   of this RFP, the contractor will solicit nominations throughout the
   state for panel members and provide raw and summarized results to the
   Project Officer. Commission staff will evaluate nominees, and the
   Executive Director will appoint panel members. Each of these panels are
   expected to have ten members, with the exception of the panel for
   languages other than English. Because several languages must be
   represented on this panel, it is expected to have 20 members. 4 These
   panels will develop, in their respective areas, (a) content
   specifications and tests, and (b) teacher preparation program
   standards, of which the content specifications become a part. The
   contractor and Commission staff will work with the panels in the
   development of content specifications and tests; Commission staff will
   work with the panels in the development of program standards. In its
   work on the PET exam, the contractor will work with the Commission's
   current PET advisory panel, consisting of 11 active members. The Bias
   Review Committee The Commission's current Bias Review Committee roster
   includes 25 California educators from diverse ethnic, cultural, and
   gender backgrounds. The committee has served the Commission in the past
   by reviewing various test materials for potential bias. Many of the
   current members, however, have not been active members. As described in
   Part 3A, the contractor will assist the Commission in selecting a new
   15-member Bias Review Committee that will include some current members
   and some new members. The Bias Review Committee will review test
   materials (e.g., content specifications, test items) for the purpose of
   detecting and eliminating potential bias or offensiveness. California
   Teaching Credentials The Commission issues two types of credentials for
   teaching academic subjects in the general education program for K-12
   students in California, and a credential that authorizes special
   education in specific areas. The Multiple Subject Teaching Credential
   authorizes the teaching of all subjects in self-contained or core
   classrooms. In a self-contained classroom, all (or most) subjects are
   taught by one teacher to a group of students who spend all (or most) of
   the school day with that teacher. In core classrooms, at least two
   subjects (e.g., language arts and social studies) are taught to the
   same group of students by one teacher. Although authorized to teach in
   any grade (K-12), teachers with Multiple Subject Teaching Credentials
   typically teach in elementary and middle schools in grades K-8. The
   Single Subject Teaching Credential authorizes the teaching of a
   specific subject area in a departmentalized classroom. A
   departmentalized classroom is one in which a teacher provides
   instruction in one subject to successive groups (classes) of students,
   who receive instruction in other subjects from other teachers. Although
   teachers with Single Subject Teaching Credentials are also authorized
   to teach in any grades (K-12), they typically teach in middle and high
   schools in grades 7-12. The subject areas in which Single Subject
   Teaching Credentials are available are: agriculture, art, business,
   English, health science, home economics, industrial and technology
   education, language other than English, mathematics, music, physical
   education, science (biology), science (chemistry), science
   (geoscience2), science (physics), and social science. The Education
   Specialist Instruction Credential authorizes teaching in special day
   classes, special schools, home/hospital settings, correctional
   facilities, nonpublic schools and agencies, and resource rooms. The
   following areas of specialization are available: * Mild/Moderate
   Disabilities (K-adult) * Moderate/Severe Disabilities (K-adult) * Deaf
   and Hard of Hearing (birth-adult) * Visual Impairments (birth-adult) *
   Physical and Health Impairments (birth-adult) * Early Childhood Special
   Education (birth-pre K) 2 In the future, it is expected that the
   credential (and the exam) will be in "Earth and space science" rather
   than in "geoscience." This subject area will be referred to as "Earth
   and space science" in the remainder of this RFP, except when the
   subject is the currently used examinations or the current credential. 5
   The Subject Matter Competence Requirement for Teaching Credentials and
   Current Examinations Used by the Commission California teaching
   credential candidates are required by law to verify their subject
   matter knowledge and competence, and are provided two alternative paths
   for fulfilling this requirement. One way is to complete a
   Commission-approved program of subject matter preparation, typically at
   the baccalaureate level, at a college or university. The second way is
   to pass one or more subject matter examinations. For the examination
   option, the Commission currently uses several examinations. For
   Multiple Subject Teaching Credential candidates, the Commission uses
   the Multiple Subjects Assessment for Teachers (MSAT; administered by
   Educational Testing Service). For Single Subject Teaching Credential
   candidates, the Commission uses selected Praxis II exams (administered
   by ETS) and the Single Subject Assessments for Teaching (SSAT)
   (administered by National Evaluation Systems, Inc.). Candidates for
   Education Specialist Instruction Credentials (other than in Early
   Childhood Special Education) must satisfy the subject matter competence
   requirement for either the Multiple Subject Teaching Credential or the
   Single Subject Teaching Credential, and they have the same two options.
   Not technically a subject matter exam, the PET exam is taken by
   candidates as a way to satisfy the basic level educational technology
   requirement for teaching credentials. The current exam is administered
   by NES as part of the SSAT program. The MSAT The MSAT consists of two
   sections: Content Knowledge and Content Area Exercises. The Content
   Knowledge section includes 120 multiple-choice items, and examinees are
   given two hours to complete this section. The Content Area Exercises
   section includes 18 constructed- response items, and examinees are
   provided three hours to complete this section. As required by law, the
   content areas covered by the MSAT include history and social studies,
   human development, literature and language studies, mathematics,
   physical education, science, and the visual and performing arts. The
   MSAT is administered six times per year and at 45 test centers in
   California. Additionally, ETS offers the examination at over 500 test
   centers throughout the United States and its territories, facilitating
   the recruitment of out-of-state teachers. Oregon has also established
   the MSAT as a requirement for teacher licensure.3 For this reason,
   Oregon is second to California in MSAT registration volumes per testing
   year. Table 1 on the next page shows the number of California and
   Oregon registrants for each section of the MSAT and the total MSAT
   registration volumes for the last four testing years.4 The data
   represent sums of the data from each of the administrations during a
   testing year. Thus, individuals who registered for the MSAT on more
   than one occasion during a year are counted each time they registered.
   3 The Oregon Teacher Standards and Practices Commission may wish to use
   the new elementary subject matter examination developed pursuant to
   this RFP, with some modifications. If so, the California Commission,
   the contractor, and the Oregon Commission would negotiate a contract
   amendment regarding the administration of the examination in Oregon. 4
   A registrant is a person who has registered to take the MSAT on a
   specific date and has not withdrawn, including those registrants who do
   not show up on the testing date and who have not withdrawn (absentees).

   areas in which the Commission offers Single Subject Teaching
   Credentials, shows the Praxis II and/or SSAT exams used for each, and
   indicates whether each test includes multiple-choice items,
   constructed-response items, or both. All Praxis II exams used by the
   Commission are one-hour constructed-response tests, with the exception
   of English Language, Literature, and Composition: Essays, which is a
   two-hour constructed-response test. Praxis examinations are offered six
   times per year at 42 test centers in California. Additionally, ETS
   offers the Praxis II exams at over 500 test centers throughout the
   United States and its territories. Table 4 shows the number of Praxis
   II exams used by the Commission administered in the last three testing
   years. The SSAT program includes multiple-choice-only tests and tests
   with both multiple-choice and constructed-response items. Most of these
   tests are administered four times per year and at test sites in 15
   general test areas across California. The SSAT German, Japanese,
   Korean, Mandarin, Punjabi, Russian, and Vietnamese tests are offered
   twice per year. Out-of-state administrations are available once per
   year in the areas of Atlanta, Austin, Chicago, Denver, and New York
   City. An examinee may register to take one or two tests on one test
   date. Each test session is five hours in length. Depending on the
   test(s) to be taken, an examinee may be assigned to a morning or
   afternoon session, or both. Examinees are permitted to work at their
   own pace. Table 5 provides the number of SSAT tests administered in the
   last three testing years. Additional information about the Praxis II
   exams can be found in ETS's Praxis 2001-02 California Registration
   Bulletin and Tests at a Glance, which includes sample test questions
   with answers and explanations. Information on examinations in the SSAT
   series can be obtained from NES's Single Subject Assessments for
   Teaching 2001-2002 Registration Bulletin and SSAT preparation guides.
   Current specifications for the PET exam are at www.ctc.ca.gov (Agenda
   Archives, May 2-3, 2001, PERF-1). The Commission has reports on the
   Praxis and SSAT examinations summarizing examinee participation and
   performance. Contact Chris Gramith at the Commission to request these
   documents. Her phone number is (916) 445-0229 and her e-mail address is
   cgramith@ctc.ca.gov. Transitioning to the New Examinations Elementary
   Subject Matter Examination The new elementary subject matter
   examination will be substantially different from the current MSAT.
   Rather than two subtests differentiated by testing methodology (i.e.,
   multiple choice and constructed response), the new test will consist of
   three subtests differentiated by content area. Given this significant
   difference, it would not be appropriate to allow candidates to combine
   subtest scores from the two, different examinations. Rather, an
   appropriate transition plan is needed. In September 2001, the
   Commission adopted the following transition plan. The new examination
   will be administered for the first time half-way through the 2002-03
   testing year. Once it is available, all candidates who have not
   previously earned at least the minimum score on either the MSAT Content
   Knowledge Section or the Content Area Exercises Section will be
   required to pass the new examination.5 Candidates who have previously
   earned at least the minimum score on either the section will be
   provided three more opportunities to earn passing scores on the MSAT.
   These three opportunities (administrations of the current MSAT) would
   be provided over approximately the same time period as the first three
   administrations of the new examination. Educational Testing Service,
   who administers the MSAT, has agreed to the three final
   administrations. 5 There are two ways of passing the current MSAT: (1)
   by achieving at least the passing score on each section (156 and 155 on
   the Content Knowledge Section and the Content Area Exercises Section,
   respectively), or (2) by achieving at least the overall passing score
   on the two sections combined (311) and at least the minimum score on
   each section (148 and 147, respectively). 8 Table 3: Praxis II and SSAT

   Preliminary Educational Technology test was first administered in
   October 2001 to 17 examinees. Secondary Subject Matter Examinations
   Staff expects the Commission to adopt a similar transition plan for the
   secondary subject matter examinations in subject areas requiring both
   Praxis and SSAT exams. The new exams in each of these areas will be
   initially administered in the second half of a testing year. The
   currently used Praxis II and SSAT exams would continue to be
   administered and accepted during that six- month transition period. For
   subject areas requiring only SSAT exams and for the PET exam, for which
   single total test scores are given, no transition period will be
   needed. Notification of the change in required tests will be provided
   in the registration bulletins. 11 California's K-12 Student Content
   Standards The California State Board of Education has adopted K-12
   student content standards in five curricular areas: reading and
   language arts, including standards for English language development for
   students whose primary language is not English; mathematics; science;
   history and social science; and visual and performing arts. The content
   standards are the specific academic knowledge, skills, and abilities
   that all K-12 students in California are expected to learn in each
   grade level. All sets of standards are available at the California
   State Board's web site (http://www.cde.ca.gov/board/board.html). The
   State Board may adopt K-12 student content standards in other subject
   areas in the future. The subject matter exams must be aligned with the
   student content standards. Related Work Completed or In Progress The
   contractor will not have to start "from scratch" in the development of
   the new exams. Significant work has already been accomplished or is in
   progress for the elementary subject matter examination and for the
   single subject examinations in English, mathematics, science, and
   social science. In addition, the Commission owns or has license to use
   a number of test items on the MSAT and the SSAT exams that, if they are
   consistent with new content specifications, could be used on the new
   tests. The New Elementary Subject Matter Examination In September 2001,
   the Commission adopted new content specifications for the subject
   matter requirement for the Multiple Subject Teaching Credential. These
   will serve as the content specifications for the new elementary subject
   matter examination to be developed and administered by the contractor.
   The content specifications were developed on the basis of a job
   analysis and a survey-based validity study, and they are aligned with
   the State Board's student content standards for grades K-8 in English,
   mathematics, science, and social science. The specifications are
   available at www.ctc.ca.gov/SB2042/SB2042_info.html. The New Secondary
   Subject Matter Examinations The Commission's subject matter advisory
   panels in English, mathematics, science, and social science are in the
   process of developing subject matter requirements in these areas that
   will both (a) delineate required program content and (b) serve as
   content specifications for new examinations. Preliminary subject matter
   requirements have been developed that are aligned with the student
   content standards for grades 6-12. A survey-based validity study of the
   preliminary subject matter requirements will be initiated in January
   2002. It is expected that final subject matter requirements will be
   adopted by the Commission in April 2002. The preliminary subject matter
   requirements are available at www.ctc.ca.gov. Extant Test Items
   Available for Use on the New Tests For both the MSAT and the SSAT exams
   (including the PET exam), the Commission owns or has license to use
   some test items that could be used on the new exams, if appropriate.
   Information about these extant available items is provided in Tables 6
   (MSAT) and 7 (SSAT) below. The Project Officer will provide to the
   contractor master copies of all extant test items available for use on
   the new tests, their answer keys, and any associated material that is
   available. 12 Table 6: Number of MSAT Multiple-Choice Items Available

   must purchase a copy of and secure permission to use any photographs or
   photographic representations prior to using them on a test form. Table

   Content Specifications Prior to developing tests for agriculture, art,
   business, health science, home economics, industrial and technology
   education, languages other than English, music, and physical education,
   and PET, the contractor will develop and validate content
   specifications for these exams. The contractor will work with the
   subject matter advisory panels and the Bias Review Committee in this
   process. Preliminary content specifications, developed by the
   contractor and the advisory panels, should be the subject of a validity
   study conducted by the contractor to establish their legal
   defensibility. Tables 8 and 9 provide information about the number of
   credentialed teachers in each of these subject areas.6 Bidders should
   consider this information as they plan their proposed validity studies.

   These data were compiled by American Institutes for Research using a
   state database (CBEDS), which is the best, but not a perfect, source of
   information about California's teacher population. The number of
   teachers who (a) have a teaching credential in the area and (b) were
   assigned in 2000-01 to teach one or more classes in the area are shown.
   The totals are greater than the sum of the groups because of other
   ethnicities. The number of teachers credentialed in and teaching
   languages other than English, by language, is not available. Table 9 on
   the next page, however, shows the number of language other than English
   classes taught, by language, in 2000-01. 6 Because the PET exam is a
   way of satisfying the educational technology requirement for all
   teaching credentials, the pool of teachers appropriate for a validity
   study of the content specifications for that exam includes teachers in
   all credential areas. 15 Table 9: Estimated Number of Language Other

   SCOPE OF WORK This part of the RFP describes the scope of the services
   and products that the contractor will provide to the Commission. Part
   3A describes the scope of work related to the development of the new
   examinations. Part 3B describes the scope of work associated with the
   administration of the new examinations. The scope of work specified in
   Part 3 represents the minimum required of the contractor. The
   Commission encourages bidders to propose low or no cost enhancements,
   improvements, or innovations to each part of the scope of work. Note,
   however, that examinee test fees, by which the contractor will be paid
   for the work, are an important criterion for evaluating proposals. Part
   3A: Test Development This part of the RFP describes the test
   development work to be performed by the contractor. Tests to be
   Developed The contractor will develop subject matter examinations for
   prospective teachers who choose to meet the teaching credential subject
   matter competence requirement by taking exams. This includes an
   examination for prospective elementary teachers, which must cover the
   following subject areas: * reading, language, and literature * history
   and social science * science * mathematics * physical education *
   visual and performing arts * human development Content specifications
   for this exam have been developed and adopted by the Commission. They
   are available at www.ctc.ca.gov/SB2042/SB2042_info.html. The contractor
   will administer this test six times per year. Test development for the
   elementary subject matter examination must be scheduled so that it can
   be administered three times during the second half of the 2002- 03
   testing year (i.e., ready for initial administration in January or
   February 2003). In addition, the contractor will develop examinations
   in the following thirteen subject areas for prospective secondary
   teachers: * English * mathematics * science7 * social science *
   physical education * art 7 The Commission issues four Single Subject
   Teaching Credentials in science, one each in biology, chemistry,
   geoscience, and physics. Candidates who choose to satisfy the subject
   matter competence requirement for these credentials by examination must
   demonstrate competence in both the area of the credential (e.g.,
   biology, chemistry) and in general science, which includes knowledge,
   skills, and abilities from all four science areas. Thus, the contractor
   will develop subtests in general science, biology, chemistry, Earth and
   space science (geoscience), and physics. 17 * music * languages other
   than English (see discussion below) * agriculture * business * health
   science * home economics * industrial and technology education The
   contractor will also develop and then administer a new Preliminary
   Educational Technology (PET) examination. Content specifications for
   the English, mathematics, science, and social science exams are under
   development at this time. A validity study of the preliminary
   specifications (called "subject matter requirements," or SMRs) is in
   process. The preliminary specifications are available at
   www.ctc.ca.gov. It is expected that the Commission will adopt final
   versions in April 2002. The contractor will administer these tests six
   times per year. Test development must be scheduled so that the tests
   can be administered three times during the second half of the 2002-03
   testing year (i.e., ready for initial administration in January or
   February 2003). The contractor will develop and validate content
   specifications for the other tests, as described below, for adoption by
   the Commission, and then develop those tests. For art, languages other
   than English, music, PET, and physical education, the contractor will
   develop the content specifications and the tests so that they can be
   administered two times during the second half of the 2003-04 testing
   year, and four times per year thereafter. For the remaining areas, the
   contractor will develop the content specifications and the tests so
   that they can be administered two times during the second half of the
   2004-05 testing year, and four times per year thereafter. Tests for
   Languages Other Than English The Commission currently has standardized,
   regularly administered tests available for teacher credential
   candidates in the following languages other than English: * French *
   German * Japanese * Korean * Mandarin * Punjabi * Russian * Spanish *
   Vietnamese As shown in Tables 4 and 5 above, all of these tests except
   Spanish and French are low-volume tests. On occasion, the Commission
   receives requests for tests in other languages. It may be
   cost-ineffective to regularly offer standardized exams in low-volume
   languages. The Commission's goal is to provide, as cost-effectively as
   possible, tests/assessments in as many languages for which there is a
   legitimate need. For Spanish and French, the contractor will develop
   and regularly administer (four times per year) standardized exams. For
   each of the other languages listed above, and for any other language
   for which the Commission receives a request that the Commission
   approves,8 the contractor will either (a) develop and regularly
   administer (at least two times per year) a standardized exam, or (b)
   develop and implement an 8 The Commission expects to develop criteria
   for responding to requests for tests/assessments in new languages. The
   criteria would be related to the need for credentialed teachers in the
   language and the probability of finding employment as a teacher of the
   language. 18 alternative language assessment that is valid, reliable,
   available at least twice per year, and more cost-effective than a
   regularly administered standardized exam. An alternative language
   assessment might, for example, include paper-and-pencil elements, which
   may or may not be administered at a time and place that other
   standardized exams (e.g., English, mathematics) are administered, and
   it might include candidate performance in front of a two-or
   three-member assessor panel. Alternative language assessments must be
   as equivalent as possible to the standardized language assessments, and
   they must consist of separately scored subtests, all of which can be
   completed on the same day. The alternative language assessments must
   meet the test development goals and criteria listed below to the extent
   possible. Test Structure9 Each test will consist of separately
   administered and separately scored subtests. Examinees will be provided
   with an uninterrupted 5-hour testing session, during which they can
   take any or all subtests, working on one at a time.10 Tables 10-14
   below show the test structures for the elementary subject matter exam
   and the exams in English, mathematics, science, and social science,
   respectively. These structures have been determined by Commission staff
   with input from the subject matter advisory panels. Some changes might
   be made in these structures, either as a result of a suggestion from
   the panel, Commission staff, or the contractor, and more detail will be
   needed to guide test development. Nevertheless, bidders should use
   these structures as basic models when preparing their responses to this

   structures for the elementary subject matter exam and the exams in
   English, mathematics, science, and social science assume (with one
   exception; see math structure) multiple-choice items of a nature that a
   minimally competent examinee (as this term is typically defined in
   standard setting studies) could complete 50 items in one hour. For the
   constructed- response items, the time specified is the amount of time
   within which a minimally competent examinee could prepare an adequate
   (i.e., just passing) response. Test structures for the remaining tests
   (art, agriculture, business, health science, home economics, industrial
   and technology education, languages other than English for which the
   contractor develops a regularly administered standardized exam, music,
   PET, and physical education) have not yet been determined. They will be
   determined by Commission staff in consultation with the advisory panels
   and the contractor. Bidders should assume that these tests will have
   structures similar to the English, mathematics, and social science test
   structures in the following ways: * Each test will have subtests,
   preferably three, no more than four. * Each subtest will include
   multiple-choice and/or constructed-response test items. * Each test
   will be structured so that a minimally competent examinee could
   complete all three subtests in approximately 4.5 hours. For regularly
   administered standardized exams in languages other than English,
   bidders should assume there will be speaking and listening components.
   For the physical education exam, bidders should assume that part of the
   test will include a videotape stimulus. For the music exam, bidders
   should assume that part of the test will include an audiotaped
   stimulus. For the art test, bidders should assume that examinees would
   be asked to draw something using pen and/or pencil, and that examinees
   may be asked to bring photographs of their own artwork and write about
   them. Test Development Goals and Criteria The contractor shall develop
   the exams in such a way that the following goals and criteria are met.
   The goals and criteria for test development described below are the
   minimum requirements for test development. The contractor can use or
   adapt existing Commission- owned MSAT and SSAT items as long as they
   meet the criteria specified below. The contractor may also use extant
   items that the contractor owns or has a right to use provided that (a)
   the items meet the criteria specified below and (b) the Commission is
   given an unlimited right to use the items for California purposes in
   perpetuity. 1. Where sufficient Ns are possible, all items must meet
   psychometric standards typically applied to high-stakes teacher
   licensure examinations, including standards related to bias, before
   being used operationally (i.e., before being used to determine a
   candidate's test score). 2. All items must be accurate, match the
   content specifications, be free from bias, and be at an appropriate
   difficulty level. 3. Each test will be small in comparison to the
   breadth and depth of the knowledge and skills included in the content
   specifications. Therefore, all items must test important, central, key
   aspects of the content specifications that are clearly needed for
   successful performance by a beginning teacher in the subject area.
   Testing of trivial, minor, peripheral, obscure, insignificant knowledge
   or skills, even if allowed by the content specifications, must be
   avoided. In addition, the difficulty level of each question must be
   appropriate for beginning teachers. 4. All items and score scales must
   be approved by the appropriate subject matter advisory panel before
   being field-tested or used operationally. 5. All items and score scales
   must be reviewed by the Bias Review Committee before being field-tested
   or used operationally. Bias Review Committee concerns must be addressed
   prior to subject matter advisory panel approval of these materials. 22
   6. All constructed-response items must be field-tested with an adequate
   number of subjects (similar to those who will ultimately take the test)
   for determining the quality of the items. 7. For each
   constructed-response item, the contractor shall (a) develop for
   advisory panel approval a scoring guide that operationalizes the
   scoring scale in terms of the prompt- specific content and (b) identify
   a set of marker responses approved by the advisory panel, or at least
   three representative members of the advisory panel. 8. A sufficient
   number of multiple-choice and constructed-response items must be
   developed per test (i.e., per subtest) so that each test has the
   following characteristics beginning with its initial administration and
   continuing for four and a half years of test administration:11 a. The
   test is administered six times per year (elementary subject matter, and
   English, math, all science, and social science) or four times per year
   (all other tests). b. A different test form is used at each
   administration. All test forms are equated. c. There is no more than a
   fifty percent overlap of multiple-choice items on test forms used at
   consecutive administrations. d. No multiple-choice item appears on the
   test forms at three consecutive administrations. e. There is no overlap
   of constructed-response items on test forms used at consecutive
   administrations. f. No constructed-response item appears on a test form
   more than once every five (for tests administered six times per year)
   or four (for tests administered four times per year) administrations.
   g. On each test form, as many elements of the content specifications
   are to be tested as possible. For tests in which not all elements of
   the content specifications can be assessed on each test form, all
   elements must be assessed as equally as possible within a testing year.
   It is expected that many of the test items will include stimulus
   material such as excerpts from primary source documents, maps, graphs,
   charts, reproductions of art, and other graphic (non- textual)
   material. For such material not developed by the contractor, the
   contractor will be responsible for obtaining all required copyrights
   and/or permission to use such materials when necessary. Bidders should
   assume that up to 33% of the test items to be developed will have such
   stimulus material. Development and Validation of Content Specifications
   for Agriculture, Art, Business, Health Science, Home Economics,
   Industrial and Technology Education, Languages other than English,
   Music, PET, and Physical Education Prior to developing the tests for
   agriculture, art, business, health science, home economics, industrial
   and technology education, languages other than English, music, physical
   education, and the PET, the contractor will develop and validate
   content specifications for these exams.12 The contractor will work with
   the subject matter advisory panels and the Bias Review Committee in
   this process. Where applicable, the content specifications should be
   aligned and 11 That is, sufficient test development must be
   accomplished during this contract to meet the goals and criteria
   described herein for both (a) the test administration period of this
   contract (i.e., through 2005/06) and (b) one (for the elementary
   subject matter, English, mathematics, science, and social science
   exams), two (for the physical education, art, music, languages other
   than English, and PET exams), or three (for the remaining exams)
   additional years of administration pursuant to a subsequent contract.
   12 It is anticipated that for the various languages other than English,
   the test content specifications will be highly similar for each
   language. They should only differ if there are language-specific
   characteristics that need to be specified. One content advisory panel,
   consisting of representatives of several languages, will be appointed
   for languages other than English. If, following development of the
   content specifications for languages other than English, the Commission
   approves a request for a test in a language that was not represented on
   the panel, the contractor, in consultation with the Project Officer,
   will identify and work with three speakers of the language to identify
   any language-specific characteristics. 23 congruent with student
   content standards for grades 6-12 adopted by the California State Board
   of Education, or in their absence, other relevant state content or
   curriculum policies (e.g., curriculum frameworks). Preliminary content
   specifications, developed by the contractor and the advisory panels,
   should be the subject of a validity study conducted by the contractor
   to establish their legal defensibility. Potential methodologies for the
   validity study include statewide surveys (paper and/or electronic)
   and/or statewide focus group reviews. The contractor will present the
   results of the validity study to the applicable subject matter advisory
   panel, which will use the results to modify the preliminary content
   specifications as necessary. Final recommended content specifications
   will be presented to the Commission by Commission staff. The content
   specifications adopted by the Commission will then be used by the
   contractor to develop the tests. Goals and Criteria for the Development
   and Validation of Content Specifications The contractor shall develop
   and validate the content specifications for agriculture, art, business,
   health science, home economics, industrial and technology education,
   languages other than English, music, PET, and physical education such
   that the following goals and criteria are met. The goals and criteria
   described below are the minimum requirements for this work and apply to
   the content specifications for each area. 1. The content specifications
   must be demonstrably valid and legally defensible. Data validating the
   specifications must include judgments from as many Asian, Black, and
   Hispanic educators as is feasible and practicable, with a goal of at
   least 25 in each group. 2. The content specifications must be aligned
   and congruent with state curricular goals, expectations, and standards
   for students in grades 6-12. 3. The purposes and uses of the content
   specifications are to delineate the subject matter knowledge, skills,
   and abilities that are (a) to be provided to candidates in a subject
   matter preparation program, and (b) eligible for inclusion on the exams
   (i.e., exam content specifications). 4. In terms of their use as exam
   content specifications, the specifications should enable (a)
   examination development specialists to create test items (both
   multiple-choice and constructed-response items) that have high
   validity, and (b) candidates for credentials to ascertain clearly the
   breadth and content of subject matter knowledge, skills, and abilities
   eligible for assessment on the exams. 5. To the extent possible, the
   content specifications should be similar to those currently be
   developed for English, math, science, and social science. Where
   appropriate, the content specifications for each subject area are
   expected to have two parts. The first part would describe several
   subject matter content domains, and the second part would describe
   subject matter skills and abilities applicable to the content domains.
   Working with the Subject Matter Advisory Panels and the Bias Review
   Committee The contractor will work directly with the Commission's
   subject matter advisory panels and Bias Review Committee. The roles of
   these groups were specified above. The contractor will assist the
   Commission in (a) augmenting the Elementary Subject Matter Advisory
   Panel to a total of 35 active members (five for each of the seven
   subject areas), (b) selecting a new 15-member Bias Review Committee
   that includes some current members and some new members and at least
   three Asian educators, at least three Black educators, and at least
   three Hispanic educators, and (c) selecting advisory panels for the
   remaining test areas13. 13 These panels should each have 10 active
   members except for the panel for languages other than English, which
   should have 20 active members representing several languages (e.g., 3
   members each for Spanish, French, Japanese, and German and two members
   each for four other languages). 24 The contractor will do this by
   soliciting and obtaining nominations from the field statewide, and
   summarizing the qualifications of nominees. Commission staff will
   review the nominations and the summary of qualifications and appoint
   members to the panels and Bias Review Committee. In consultation with
   the Project Officer, the contractor will be responsible for all aspects
   and costs of advisory panel and Bias Review Committee meetings at which
   the contractor works with the group on tasks associated with the
   contract. These res
