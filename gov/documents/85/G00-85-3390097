                             SimSat Communications

   SimSat is not a club. There are no dues. No regular business meetings.
   Just a results-oriented grass roots group of talented individuals
   working together to help a bunch of kids follow up on some of the
   really neat things learned in class - and beyond.

   Good coordination and communications are important to this type of
   organization. A set of communications tools is available to make it so.
   You may use the SimSat mail list to keep up to date on all activities.
   The service is free to any one with an active e-mail address. The
   service is provided by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

   TO SUBSCRIBE

   When subscribing, be sure to provide your name and affiliation.

   There are two ways to subscribe to the SimSat mail list. The easiest is
   to visit the GSFC Majordomo web site for SimSat and fill out the brief
   request form. Go to
   http://listserv.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/majordomo/info/simsat via the
   Web.
   OR you may send your request to majordomo@listserv.gsfc.nasa.gov via
   e-mail using the following instructions:
   When subscribing by e-mail, include as the FIRST LINE of text in the
   body of your message your own information in the form:
   subscribe simsat "Terry Smith, H.S. teacher, Hyattsville MD"
   [tsmith@mentor.umd.edu]
   Between the quote marks PLEASE include your name, callsign if any, your
   affiliation and location. Change the [] brackets shown above to <>
   brackets in your message. Place your own *direct* e-mail address
   between the <> brackets. Avoid giving a remailer address because the
   automated system would not recognize a post from you.
   Note: The text you place on the subject line of your subscribe request
   is ignored by the machine. It's for your record purposes only. Also,
   the volume of traffic is relatively low at this time. Nonetheless, one
