          This Fact Sheet provides an overview of the history of the
          volcanic field and the basic volcano types. It also includes a
          really nice DEM of the entire volcanic field which stretches
          from Williams across Flagstaff and east beyond Sunset Crater to
          Grand Falls.

   [land_icon.gif] Volcano/Ice Interaction on Earth and Mars

          Photos from Field Trips

          The conference on Volcano/ice interaction on Earth and Mars was
          the first of its kind. The aim was to bring together geologists,
          geophysicists, glaciologists and planetary scientists studying
          various aspects of the interaction of volcanoes and ice
          sheets/ice caps.
