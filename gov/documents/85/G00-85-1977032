   There is one word of advice and caution to be given those intending to
   visit Alaska for pleasure. If you are old, go by all means. But if you
   are young, wait. The scenery of Alaska is much grander than anything
   else of the kind in the world and it is not well to dull one's capacity
   for enjoyment by seeing the finest first.



   National Geographic Society President Henry Gannett  Member of the 1899
   Harriman Expedition to Alaska

   Quoted by Gov. Knowles  speaking to the National Audubon Society Board
