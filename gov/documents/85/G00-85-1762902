          Audience: Healthcare professionals and Consumers
          Aloe Flex Enterprises of Dickinson, Texas is recalling all lots
          of its 1 ounce bottles of "Weider's Eyedrops" due to potentially

   Xeloda (capecitabine)
          Audience: Oncologists, Pharmacists, and other healthcare
          professionals
          FDA and Roche have added a BLACK BOX WARNING and strengthened
          the PRECAUTIONS section in the label for Xeloda, indicated for
          the treatment of colorectal and breast cancer. A clinically
          important XELODA-Warfarin drug interaction was demonstrated in a
          clinical pharmacology trial. Postmarketing reports have shown
          clinically significant increases in prothrombin time and INR in
          patients who were stabilized on anticoagulants at the time
          XELODA was introduced. Patients receiving concomitant
          capecitabine and oral coumarin-derivative anticoagulant therapy
          should have their anticoagulant response (INR or prothrombin
          time) monitored frequently in order to adjust the anticoagulant
          dose accordingly. The Patient Package Insert was also revised to
          reflect this new safety information. New information is
          highlighted in the labels below.

          Centocor, in consultation with FDA, is alerting physicians to
          potential serious adverse effects of REMICADE in patients with
          CHF. Preliminary results of an ongoing phase 2 trial in patients
          with moderate to severe CHF demonstrated higher incidences of
          mortality and hospitalization for worsening heart failure in
          patients treated with REMICADE, especially those treated with
          the higher dose of 10 mg/kg. Based on these preliminary
          findings, and pending additional data, precautionary measures
          were recommended in a "Dear Healthcare Professional" letter.

          Audience: Orthopedic Surgeons
          Healthcare professionals are notified of a voluntary recall of
          the unimplanted inventory of nine batches of zirconia ceramic
          femoral heads manufactured by a French manufacturer, and by U.S.

   Neumega (oprelvekin)
          Audience: Oncologists, particularly Pediatric Oncologists
          Wyeth-Ayerst notifies health professionals of safety information
          for NEUMEGA use in the pediatric population. Preliminary data
          from a safety and pharmacokinetic study in 47 children has
          identified papilledema as a dose-limiting adverse reaction in
          the pediatric population. There are no controlled clinical
          studies that have established a safe and effective dose of
          NEUMEGA in children. Therefore, the administration of NEUMEGA in
          children, particularly those under 12 years of age, should be
          restricted to controlled clinical trial settings with closely
          monitored safety assessments. See the full letter below for
          further details.

          wholesalers
          Organon Inc. initiated a voluntary recall of Raplon®
          (rapacuronium bromide) for injection. Several serious adverse
          events, including bronchospasm and unexplained fatalities, were
          reported during postmarketing surveillance (in each of these
          cases the cause was unknown, as there were multiple drugs
          administered and other conditions present). The posted letter is
          part of a package distributed by the manufacturer.

   Taxotere (docetaxel)
          Audience: Wholesalers, hospital pharmacists, and oncology
          healthcare professionals
          Aventis Pharmaceuticals has initiated a voluntary recall of
          Taxotere® (docetaxel) for Injection Concentrate 20-mg active and
          diluent vials. The lot numbers for this recall are: 0P273
          (active) which was packaged together with diluent vials with the
          following lot numbers: 0T446 (diluent) or 0T449 (diluent). It
          has been determined that the Taxotere 20mg vial containing the
          active ingredient may have inadvertently been labeled as a
          diluent vial. Aventis has received one product complaint related
          to this mislabeling.

   Healthcare providers reminded to closely monitor patients on arsenic
          trioxide
          CTI has issued a "Dear Health Care Provider" letter reminding
          clinicians that QTc prolongation with torsade de pointes
          arrhythmia and sudden death have been associated with the use of
          arsenic trioxide. An article published recently in Blood
          (Unnikrishnan, et al, 1 March 2001;97:15141516) describes
          prolonged QT interval and torsade de pointes in 3 patients being
          treated with arsenic trioxide for acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
          The arsenic trioxide used in the reported study was not Cell
          Therapeutics Trisenox (arsenic trioxide) injection. The current
          Trisenox label emphasizes the importance of ECG and electrolyte
          monitoring prior to and during therapy in patients given arsenic
          trioxide.

   Lead Exposure from Dental Films Stored in Lead-Lined Table-top
          Containers
          Potential for harmful lead exposure from dental films stored in
          containers lined with unpainted lead. There may be hundreds of
          these lead-lined boxes currently being used to store dental
          films. Some of them may have been in use for decades. Most of
          these boxes are the size and shape of shoe-boxes, made of wood,
          and lined with lead that has apparently not been painted or
          coated.

          Fatal lactic acidosis has recently been reported in pregnant
          women treated throughout gestation with the combination of
          stavudine and didanosine. Based on these cases, the combination
          of Zerit (stavudine) and Videx (didanosine) should be used with
          caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the
          potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk, such as
          when there are few remaining treatment options.
