     Accessibility Statement
       _______________________________________________________________

     USDA is committed to making its web sites accessible to all USDA
     customers and employees. All of the agency web sites are undergoing
     review and redesign as necessary to ensure that they meet or exceed
     the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

     Many of our web sites currently meet the Section 508 accessibility
     standards. Furthermore, USDA continues to work on making all web
     sites accessible. Thank you very much for your patience through this
     redesign process. If you have any comments or suggestions for
     improvement, please contact the Web Master of this page.
