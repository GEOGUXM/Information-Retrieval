                                   [About
   The NREN team collaborates with other Federal agencies, academia, and
   industry, recognizing that revolutionary advances in network technology
   can more readily be achieved by working together. Partnership between
   the various groups is manifested in testbed, research, and application
   activities.

   The Interagency Working Group on Information Technology Research and
   Development (IWG/IT R&D) provides a collaborative framework for Federal
   agencies whose critical missions require advanced information
   technology research and development. These agencies include:
     * Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
     * Department of Energy (DoE)
     * NASA
     * National Institutes of Health (NIH)
     * National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
     * National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
     * National Science Foundation (NSF)
     * National Security Agency (NSA)

   Coordination of networking activities between these agencies is managed
   by the Large Scale Networking (LSN) Program Component Area of the
   IWG/IT R&D. Three LSN teams address various components of networking
   technology. The LSN Networking Research Team (NRT) coordinates Federal
   agency research programs; the LSN Joint Engineering Team (JET)
   coordinates network engineering issues such as network architecture,
   connectivity, and interoperability; and the LSN High Performance
   Networking Applications Team (HPNAT) promotes the development of
   advanced applications. The NREN team actively participates in LSN
   activities and is represented on each of the LSN teams.
