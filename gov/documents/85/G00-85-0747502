   Filtering the UMLS速 Metathesaurus速 for MetaMap 2000 Edition Alan R.
   Aronson March 27, 2000 1. Overview The MetaMap program's primary
   purpose is to discover the Metathesaurus concepts referred to in
   arbitrary text. A given Metathesaurus concept can have many alternative
   names (Metathesaurus strings) which originate in the many source
   vocabularies included in the Metathesaurus. As the number of strings
   has grown over the years, MetaMap's performance has suffered. In 2000,
   for example, the Metathesaurus has 1,339,497 English strings, 1,335,802
   (99.7%) of them distinct, comprising 730,154 concepts representing a
   15% increase over the 1999 edition. Many of these strings are of little
   value to MetaMap for one of four reasons. First, some strings either
   represent generic, nonmedical concepts or are unnecessarily ambiguous.
   Second, some strings are virtually indistinguishable from each other.
   For efficiency, only one representative of a set of indistinguish- able
   strings is needed. Third, some Metathesaurus strings have internal
   structure which makes it highly unlikely to find them in regular text.
   Fourth, some strings, including lengthy descriptions of things such as
   procedures, health activities or medical devices, are so complicated
   that it is again unlikely to find them in normal text. Corresponding to
   the four classes of strings are four fil- tering methods for
   discovering and removing them: manual filtering, lexical filtering,
   filtering by type, and syntactic filtering. These methods are discussed
   in sections 2-5. Then section 6 describes ways to selectively combine
   the filtering methods to produce a range of alternative views of the
   Metathesaurus appropriate for various purposes. 2. Manual Filtering A
   small number of Metathesaurus strings are problematic and have been
   suppressed before per- forming other forms of filtering. There are 657
   such strings, 22% more than in 1999. Note, how- 1 3. Lexical Filtering
   ever, that the growth from 1999 occurs with the unnecessarily ambiguous
   terms and arises from more careful analysis rather than an actual
   increase in ambiguity: * Numbers (e.g., 2, +1, -4, 98.734, 50000) [144
   occurrences]; * Single alphabetic characters (e.g., a, A, b, B <3>;
   note the ambiguity designator) [125 occur- rences]; * Unnecessarily
   ambiguous terms [387 occurrences] "Other <2>", ... (however, "Other"
   itself is retained) "Protocols <1>', ... (however, "Protocols" itself
   is retained) ... * Special cases [1 occurrence] "0" for "TPBF protein"
   (from RCD99) [included in numbers] "Periods" for "Menstruation" (from
   RCD99) Although a few numbers correspond to biomedical entities
   ("98.734" has semantic types `Steroid' and `Pharmacologic Substance'),
   they generally have semantic types `Quantitative Concept' or
   `Intellectual Product'. Similarly, the single alphabetics generally
   mean the letter itself (the con- cept for "a" is "Lower case ay") and
   have semantic type `Intellectual Product'. Several single alphabetics,
   however are biomedical: "B" has concept "Boron" with semantic types
   `Pharmaco- logic Substance', `Biologically Active Substance' and
   `Element, Ion, or Isotope'. The third class of problematic strings are
   the unnecessarily ambiguous ones (see Ambiguity in the UMLS速 Meta-
   thesaurus速 for details). A final class of special cases includes the
   string "0" for "TPBF protein" and "Periods" for "Menstruation". The
   first example is subsumed by the numbers class, and the second example
   arises because the word periods occurs in biomedical text but has been
   associated with "Menstruation" due to slang usage. 3. Lexical Filtering
   Lexical filtering is the most benign type of filtering and consists of
   removing strings for a concept which are effectively the same as
   another string for the concept. Properties which can make strings
   effectively the same are: * non-essential parentheticals; *
   Metathesaurus multiple meaning designators; * NEC/NOS variation; *
   syntactic uninversion; * case variation; * hyphen variation; and *
   possessives. Lexical filtering is accomplished by normalizing all
   strings for a given concept and removing all but one string for each
   set of strings that normalize to the same thing. 3.1 Non-essential
   parentheticals Non-essential parentheticals are parenthetical
   expressions within a string which provide meta information about the
   string. As such they are not useful for text processing. Non-essential
   paren- theticals can occur at the left or right end of a string and can
   be delimited by either parentheses or brackets. For example the concept
   "Anemia, Hemolytic" has synonyms "[X]Haemolytic anemias" Filtering the
   UMLS Metathesaurus for MetaMap (2000 Edition) 2 3. Lexical Filtering
   and "[X]Hemolytic anemias" both of which contain the left parenthetical
   "[X]". Previous editions of the Metathesaurus only contained right
   parentheticals which seemed to be relatively well- behaved in the sense
   that a string without the parenthetical was almost always present in
   the set of strings for a given concept. Thus, "Drug Toxicity (Non
   MeSH)" had a string "Drug Toxicity". Now right parentheticals are much
   less well-behaved and only a few left parentheticals can be reliably
   removed without altering the string's meaning. These left
   parentheticals come from the Read Codes: "[X]", "[V]", "[D]", "[M]",
   "[EDTA]", "[SO]" and "[Q]". These are the only paren- theticals
   declared to be non-essential and removed from strings. The problem of
   detecting non- essential parentheticals has changed as the
   Metathesaurus has matured. The current practice of removing the few
   left parentheticals listed above is by no means adequate. The problem
   requires further analysis. 3.2 Metathesaurus multiple meaning
   designators Strings such as "Cold <1>" and "Cold <2>" end with a
   multiple meaning designator, i.e., a num- ber within angle brackets.
   These designators are essentially parenthetical expressions and are
   like- wise removed. (Note that for 1999, each string "AAA " ending with
   a multiple meaning designator has a corresponding string "aaa" without
   it where "AAA" and "aaa" differ only by case.) 3.3 NEC/NOS variation
   Many of the Metathesaurus vocabularies incorporate the acronyms NEC
   (Not Elsewhere Cov- ered) and NOS (Not Otherwise Specified) into their
   terms. Examples include "Psychotherapy, NEC", "Abdomen, NOS", "X-RAY
   NEC AND NOS", and "INJURY NEC/NOS". As with case variation, the
   presence of NEC and/or NOS does not generally have a significant effect
   on the meaning of the term. The argument for ignoring NEC/NOS variation
   is not as strong as that for case variation, but it still seems
   reasonable for most text processing. 3.4 Syntactic uninversion
   Inversion refers to the practice of inverting words of a term and
   inserting a comma to signal the inversion. It is normally done to index
   the original term under each of its important words and thereby make it
   more accessible. Inverted forms of a term, however, are not useful for
   processing text since inverted forms rarely appear in text. The concept
   "1,4-alpha-Glucan Branching Enzyme" has some interesting inversions. It
   has a synonym "Branching Enzyme" with inversion "Enzyme, Branching",
   and it also has a synonym "Starch Branching Enzyme" with two inver-
   sions, "Branching Enzyme, Starch" and "Enzyme, Starch Branching". The
   process of uninversion simply undoes inversion, i.e., it searches for a
   comma followed by a space, inverts the term at that point and removes
   the comma and space. Syntactic uninversion is just uninversion which is
   inhib- ited if the term contains a preposition or conjunction. This
   prevents terms such as "Biological Phenomena, Cell Phenomena, and
   Immunity" or "Legal blindness, as defined in U.S.A." from being
   incorrectly uninverted. Note that the concept "1,4-alpha-Glucan
   Branching Enzyme" men- tioned earlier is also not uninverted because
   the comma within it is not followed by a space; embedded commas do not
   call for uninversion. Filtering the UMLS Metathesaurus for MetaMap
   (2000 Edition) 3 4. Filtering by Type 3.5 Case variation Two strings
   which differ from each only because of case variation normally refer to
   the same thing. For example, the concept "Abdomen <1>" has strings
   "Abdomen", "abdomen" and "ABDOMEN" which differ from each other only by
   case. Similarly, the concept "beta-Alanine" has strings, "beta
   Alanine", "beta alanine" and "BETA ALANINE", which differ from each
   other only by case. Note, however, that case does matter for some
   aspects of text processing. Text con- taining the pronoun us is not
   referring to the acronym US for the United States; and the verb aids
   does not refer to the disease AIDS. Despite this observation, case
   almost never matters within the limited context of all strings for a
   given concept. 3.6 Hyphen variation As with case variation, the
   presence of a hyphen rather than a space normally means little espe-
   cially in the context of all strings for a given concept. For example,
   the concept "1,4-alpha-Glucan Branching Enzyme" used in the last
   section has a variant "1,4 alpha Glucan Branching Enzyme" in which both
   hyphens have been replaced by spaces. 3.7 Possessives Alternatives such
   as "Down's Syndrome" and "Down Syndrome" or "American Nurses' Associa-
   tion" and "American Nurses Association" differ only by a possessive. 4.
   Filtering by Type Some Metathesaurus strings can be filtered out based
   solely on their type. For example, strings with a Term Status (TS) of
   lowercase s are suppressible synonyms; they are an abbreviated form of
   another term. "Abdomen" and "Abdomen <2>" are such synonyms of
   "Malignant neoplasm of abdomen". About 9% (124,785) of the 1,339,497
   English Metathesaurus strings are suppressible synonyms. Similarly,
   some Term Type (TTY) values indicate strings which are normally
   inappropriate for text processing. There are 178,750 occurrences of
   strings with such term types in the Meta- thesaurus. (Actually there is
   significant overlap between the inappropriate term types and the sup-
   pressible synonyms: only 55,609 (31%) of the 178,750 TTY strings are
   not already suppressible synonyms.) The filtered out term types
   together with examples for each are given in the next sec- tion. For
   completeness, this is followed by a section of questionable types and a
   final section of good types. 4.1 Filtered out Types * AA (Attribute

   Filtering The final kind of filtering considered here is based on a
   high-level syntactic parse of the Meta- thesaurus strings. Since normal
   MetaMap processing involves mapping the simple noun phrases found in
   text, it is highly unlikely that a complex Metathesaurus string will be
   part of a good map- ping. For example, the concept "Accident caused by
   caustic and corrosive substances" has high- level syntactic analysis
   [[head],[verb],[prep,head],[conj],[mod,head]] which contains seven syn-
   tactic units (head, verb, etc.) broken into five simple phrases
   ([head], [verb], etc.) Any text which resembles the concept will be
   broken up into several phrases each of which is processed sepa- rately.
   Thus, the text might map to constituent concepts (such as "Accident");
   but the entire text will not map to the full concept. The strictest
   form of syntactic filtering, then, would be to filter out any string
   consisting of more than one simple phrase. As of 1999, however, of
   strings such as "Acute necrosis of liver" and "Radical resection of
   tumor of soft tissue of leg area", which consist of a simple phrase
   followed by one or more of prepositional phrases, have been included in
   the baseline syntactic filtering because of their tractability. Less
   strict filtering might involve consid- ering both the number of phrases
   and the number of syntactic units in the phrases and would be useful
   for term processing or browsing. An analysis of the syntactic
   properties of all Meta- thesaurus strings is in progress. 6. Filtered
   Metathesaurus Models The filtering described in the previous sections
   can be selectively applied to provide different views of the
   Metathesaurus. Three such model are * Strict Model: All forms of
   filtering, manual, lexical, type-based and syntactic, are applied. This
   view is most appropriate for semantic processing where the highest
   level of accuracy is needed. The Strict Model consists of 706,593 (53%)
   of the 1,339,497 English Metathesaurus strings; * Moderate Model:
   Manual, lexical and type-based filtering, but not syntactic filtering,
   are used. This view is appropriate for term processing where input text
   should not be divided into simple phrases but considered as a whole.
