RMA Pilot Programs

   RMA strives for actuarial soundness in all Federal crop insurance
   programs that we administer. In support of this goal, RMA has a
   deliberate and careful process for development of new programs.

   Most new programs are developed at the request of farmers, following an
   in-depth study to determine if an actuarially sound program can be
   created. The new programs are tested on a pilot basis in selected
   counties to allow RMA to gain insurance experience and test the
   programs' components. Most pilot programs operate for about 2 to 3
   years before they are made more broadly available or are converted to
   permanent program status. However, during a new program's pilot period,
   expansion into new counties may be approved by the Federal Crop
   Insurance Corporation Board of Directors. RMA routinely develops,
   implements, and monitors pilot programs for new crops, new plans of
   insurance, and new management strategies.

                The pilot crop policy provisions are listed alphabetically
                by crop, and are available in PDF (Adobe Acrobat) format.
                If you need the Adobe Acrobat Reader to view the PDF
                files, or assistance downloading the files, please see our
                Help page.
