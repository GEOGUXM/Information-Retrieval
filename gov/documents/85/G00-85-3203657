                FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TARGETS INTERNATIONAL
                         INTERNET PIRACY SYNDICATES

     Multiple Enforcement Actions Worldwide Snare Top "Warez" Leadership

   WASHINGTON, D.C. Attorney General John Ashcroft announced today that in
   three separate federal law enforcement actions federal agents executed
     approximately 100 search warrants worldwide against virtually every
   level of criminal organizations engaged in illegal software piracy over
   the Internet. The three Operations, codenamed "Buccaneer," "Bandwidth"
    and "Digital Piratez," struck at all aspects of the illegal software,
          game and movie trade, often referred to as "warez scene."

    "Today U.S. law enforcement initiated the most aggressive enforcement
      action to date against illegal software piracy," Attorney General
      Ashcroft said. "Many of these individuals and groups believed the
    digital age and the Internet allowed them to operate without fear of
   detection or criminal sanction. Today, law enforcement in the U.S. and
    around the world proved them wrong. These actions mark a significant
          milestone in the efforts of U.S. law enforcement to work
       internationally to combat what is truly a global problem,"said
                                  Ashcroft.

   "The execution of these search warrants mark the completion of the most
     extensive software piracy undercover investigation that the FBI has
    participated in to date, and should send the message that trafficking
   in stolen goods whether the property is in physical or electronic form
    is a serious crime, and will be prosecuted," said Robert S. Mueller,
              Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

        The targets of these Operations included both individuals and
   organizations, known as "WAREZ" groups, that operate within the United
    States and in various nations around the world and specialize in the
       illegal distribution over the Internet of copyrighted software
    programs, computer games and movies. The investigations will continue
       to identify and pursue additional targets in the months ahead.

                            Operation Buccaneer:

    Operation Buccaneer was the culmination of an investigation that has
    been ongoing for over a year under the direction of the U.S. Customs
    Service and the Justice Department's Computer Crime and Intellectual
   Property Section, working in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney for the
                        Eastern District of Virginia.

    Buccaneer marks the most significant law enforcement penetration ever
    of international organizations engaged in the illegal distribution of
        copyrighted software, games and movies over the Internet. The
     enforcement action involved the simultaneous execution of 58 search
     warrants against high-level warez leadership and members within the
    United States and abroad. It is also the first enforcement action to
   reach across international borders and strike at the most highly placed
      and skilled members of these international criminal enterprises.

   Although one of the primary criminal enterprises targeted by Operation
   Buccaneer was the warez group known as "DrinkOrDie," which consists of
      approximately 40 members worldwide, the investigation has led to
    infiltration and development of cases against individuals from other
                             top groups as well.

      The organizations targeted by Buccaneer are highly structured and
     security-conscious criminal groups that specialize in obtaining the
     latest computer software, games, and movies; stripping ("cracking")
    copyright protections; and releasing the final product to hundreds of
    Internet sites worldwide. Because the "suppliers" to these groups are
   often company insiders, pirated products frequently are in circulation
    before, or within hours, of the release of the legitimate product to
    consumers. The groups are structured specifically to avoid detection.
       It is expected that hundreds of thousands of copies of software
    programs, computer games and movies will be recovered by this effort,
   with a retail value that is expected to be in the millions of dollars.

       Buccaneer also marks an unprecedented degree of cooperation and
    coordination with international law enforcement in the fight against
   Intellectual Property violations committed via the Internet. Through a
   variety of authorized means, the United States has shared evidence with
    counterparts in the United Kingdom, Australia, Norway, and Finland to
     help further identify and investigate numerous significant foreign
                targets engaged in this criminal conspiracy.

                            Operation Bandwidth:

   On December 11, 2001, the longest-running of the undercover operations
     culminated with the execution of over 30 search warrants across the
       United States and Canada. This undercover operation, code-named
   Bandwidth,' was a two-year covert investigation established as a joint
    investigative effort to gather evidence to support identification and
   prosecution of entities and individuals involved with illegal access to
      computer systems and the piracy of proprietary software utilizing
                    warez' storage sites on the Internet.

        Bandwidth, through the joint efforts of the Defense Criminal
      Investigative Service (DCIS), the Environmental Protection Agency
      Office of Inspector General (EPA-OIG), and the Federal Bureau of
    Investigation (FBI), supervised by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the
   District of Nevada, created a warez' site, controlled and monitored by
    the undercover operation, as a means of attracting predicated targets
     involved with the distribution of pirated software. The undercover
   warez' site has been accessed to transfer over 100,000 files, including
          over 12,000 separate software programs, movies and games.

    Over 200 different individuals participated in the software pirating
    efforts. Those individuals were able to attain first-run movies, the
    latest computer games, and versions of notable software products even
       before they were publicly introduced. As a result of Operation
    Bandwidth, thousands of copies of pirated software are expected to be
   removed from circulation, as well as the seizure and forfeiture of the
        computer hardware and servers used to facilitate the crimes.

                         Operation Digital Piratez:

    Operation Digital Piratez is a year-long undercover operation by the
    Federal Bureau of Investigation's Boston Field Office, which has been
    supervised by the United States Attorney's Office for the District of
      New Hampshire. On December 11, 2001, the FBI executed nine search
     warrant, and obtained consent for an additional three searches, on
      computers located across the country. During this investigation,
      undercover Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
   successfully infiltrated several Warez distribution organizations. This
   investigation targeted not only the Warez sites and those who operated
    them, it also targeted the "cracking groups" specifically created for
   the purpose of pirating software so that it may be distributed over the
               Internet in violation old U.S. copyright laws.

    Each of the ongoing investigations has benefitted from the important
         assistance provided by various intellectual property trade
    associations, including the Interactive Digital Software Association,
     the Business Software Alliance, the Motion Picture Association and
       individual companies, including Microsoft and Sega Corporation.
