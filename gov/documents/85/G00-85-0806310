            Rulemakings and Related Actions Concerning Webcasting

   The Copyright Office and Library of Congress have taken the following
   actions relating to rulemakings and Copyright Arbitration Royalty
   Proceedings involving the digital performance right and statutory
   license governed by 17 U.S.C. §114.

 Rulemaking to Determine Whether a Transmission of an AM or FM Radio Signal
made over a Digital Communications Network by an FCC-licensed Broadcaster is
      Exempt from the Digital Performance Right (Docket No. RM 2000-3)

     The Copyright Office has amended its regulations to clarify that
     transmissions of an AM/FM broadcast signal over a digital
     communications network, such as the Internet, are subject to a sound
     recording copyright owner's exclusive right to perform his or her
     work publicly by means of digital audio transmissions.  Broadcasters
     who choose to transmit their radio signals over a digital
     communications network such as the Internet may do so under a
     compulsory license  The Office has determined that an FCC-licensed
     broadcaster is not exempt from a copyright owner's digital
     performance right for sound recordings under these circumstances.
     Section 114(d)(1)(A) of title 17 of the United States Code exempts a
     noninteractive performance of a sound recording by means of a
     digital audio transmission from the sound recording copyright
     owner's exclusive rights when the performance is part of "a
     nonsubscription broadcast transmission." Section 114(j)(3) defines a
     broadcast transmission as "a transmission made by a terrestrial
     broadcast station licensed as such by the Federal Communications
     Commission. The Office concluded that for purposes of section 114, a
     "broadcast transmission" includes only over-the-air transmissions
     made by an FCC-licensed broadcaster under the terms of that license.

   Denial of a Petition to Initiate a Rulemaking Proceeding (Docket No. RM
                                   2000-4B

     The Copyright Office has denied a request from the Digital Media
     Association to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to decide whether a
     webcasting service becomes interactive when a consumer exerts some
     influence on the music programming offered by the service.  The
     Office declined to initiate the rulemaking because there is no
     discernable dispute on this point.  It did recognize, however, that
     the amount and type of influence a consumer has on the programming
     offered by the transmitting entity will affect whether the activity
     is characterized as interactive or noninteractive.  On this point,
     the Office determined that it would be unable to fashion a set of
     criteria or guidelines beyond those already set forth in the law

     65 FR 78434  December 15, 2000 (notice of correction)  PDF   Text

     Note:  There is a typographical error in the notice published in the
     Federal Register on December 11, 2000.  Footnote 1 should read:

       RIAA and DiMA discussed the services offered by Launch Media, Inc.,
       through its LAUNCHcast service, and MTV, through its Radio SonicNet
     service, to illustrate the type of offerings that are in dispute.  See
       RIAA comment at 6-7; DiMA reply at 18-21.  From these descriptions,
     there is considerable doubt whether either offering would qualify as a
                             noninteractive service.

  Request for Notices of Intent to Participate and the Announcement of the
                      Precontroversy Discovery Schedule
                      (Docket No. 2000-9 CARP DTRA1 &2)

     The Copyright Office is engaged in an ongoing rate adjustment
     proceeding, the purpose of which is to set rates and terms for the
     section 114 statutory license.  Docket No. 99-6 CARP DTRA.   Because
     the outcome of the rulemaking on the scope of the exemption for
     broadcasters would have a significant impacton the identity of the
     parties to this rate adjustment proceeding, the Officedecided not to
     adopt a schedule for the precontroversy discovery period forthis
     proceeding until the rulemaking was concluded.  Order, Docket No.
     99-6 CARP DTRA, March 21, 2000.  Now that the issue is resolved, the
     Copyright Office is requesting additional notices of intent to
     participate and announcing the schedule for this proceeding in a
     notice in the Federal Register.

          of Sound Recordings and Setting Schedule for Proceedings

   The Library of Congress has ordered the consolidation of the Copyright
   Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP) proceedings to establish rates and

   of an ephemeral phonorecord of a sound recording in furtherance of
   making a permitted public performance of the sound recording (17 U.S.C.
   §112(e).  The order also establishes a schedule for the consolidated
