       Workdays
      [sal_army.jpg] Earlier this year, Senator Graham completed his 365th
      workday - a year's worth of days spent laboring side-by-side with the
      people he represents. His workdays are an extension of his belief in a
      personal style of governing. He began workdays in 1974, teaching a
      semester of civics at Carol City Senior High School in Miami while
      serving in the Florida Senate. He has continued doing workdays
      throughout his tenure as governor and in the United States Senate.

      His jobs have included service as a policeman, railroad engineer,
      construction worker, fisherman, garbageman, factory worker, busboy, and
      teacher. On #365, he checked in customers, handled baggage and helped
      serve passengers on USAirways. By working closely with Floridians,
      Graham learns about the hopes and challenges they face. For him, there
      is no substitute for that kind of on-the-job experience.

   Senate Career
   In his third U.S. Senate term, Bob Graham has emerged as a leading
   voice of moderate Democrats bent on putting results ahead of politics.
   His centrist philosophy and commitment to bipartisanship have made him
   a major player in some of the most important issues facing Americans
   today, from reforming Medicare to ensuring our continued prosperity.
   Most recently, he has advanced intelligence community reform
   legislation in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Select
   Intelligence Committee. As chairman of the 17-member Senate New
   Democrats, Graham has helped bring together a coalition that shares his
   views to work together promoting sound fiscal policy that emphasizes
   paying down the debt, and social policy that strikes an equitable
   balance between the needs of all Americans. These moderates have in
   turn helped shape the debate on issues ranging from trade to education.

   The 106th Congress approved several major Graham initiatives. Among
   these was the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act, which directed the U.S.
   Sentencing Commission to raise the guidelines for trafficking in this
   dangerous drug. Beginning in May 2001, Ecstasy smugglers will face
   substantially higher penalties for dealing poisons. The legislation
   also directs funds for education and outreach to battle what has become
   a nationwide epidemic.

   [office_small.gif] Also in 2000, Graham achieved a milestone in his
   career-long battle to save America's Everglades with congressional
   approval of a comprehensive plan to restore the River of Grass. At $7.8
   billion, the Everglades restoration is the largest environmental
   project ever undertaken by the federal government. This comprehensive
   plan, a partnership with the state of Florida, will restore more than a
   century of damage done to this unique ecosystem.

    The 107th Congress promises to be equally fruitful.

   As chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Graham helps
   oversee our nation's intelligence agencies. He is the primary mover
   behind Counterintelligence 21, which President Clinton signed in
   December 2000 and the Bush administration has pledged to continue. This
   initiative is a far-reaching, methodical approach to identifying the
   most sensitive information in our government and then safeguarding that
   information. Senator Graham has also taken the lead in reforming and
   improving our intelligence community's efforts in counter-terrorism.

   The chairmanship also gives Graham a unique position from which to view
   the situation in Colombia. After several visits to the region, Graham
   introduced bipartisan legislation that will greatly expand free-trade
   benefits to Colombia and other nations in the Andean region. Graham
   believes that expanded trade will create economic opportunities in the
   region beyond the drug industry. This position is a natural extension
   of his long-standing policy of engagement with the Americas.

   The need for a prescription-drug benefit for Medicare recipients has
   long been apparent. Since 1999, Graham has lead his party in a plan
   that would provide equitable, affordable coverage for all Americans
   over 65. That plan fell victim to partisan politics but will serve as
   the basis for the Democrats' formulation of coverage this year.
   Prescription-drug coverage is just one of the changes Graham believes
   is necessary to bring Medicare into the 21st century. He has long
   advocated legislation that would turn Medicare from a sickness program
   into a wellness program by offering preventative benefits to head off
   disease before it becomes life-threatening.

   Graham legislation would also ensure that low-income legal immigrant
   children and pregnant women have access to the Medicaid and Children's
   Health Insurance Program to meet their health-care needs. He is working
   with a bipartisan coalition to restore Medicaid and other benefits
   taken from legal immigrants in the 1996 welfare reform law. Similarly,
   he is pushing for Congress to live up to promises made in that law to
   maintain funding for social services grants to the states. As a strong
   supporter of welfare reform, he believes it is necessary to keep
   focused on the original intent of that landmark legislation - helping
   adults achieve self-sufficiency. This legislation is particularly
   important in high-immigration states like Florida. [pepper.jpg]

   Graham considers Florida's diversity one of its greatest assets and has
   been a leader in the quest for sane immigration policy. He has brought
   together a broad coalition of business and labor leaders to craft a
   compromise that would provide workers for agriculture and offer
   hard-working immigrants an opportunity for a permanent legal status.

   While taking a lead on the national stage, Graham has remained active
   in and attentive to Florida issues. Graham and fellow Florida Senator
   Bill Nelson are continuing their strong, vocal opposition to drilling
   on the Outer Continental Shelf with legislation that would extend the
   current moratoria indefinitely and buy back leases in environmentally
   sensitive areas. Graham is also spearheading a campaign to reform
   dredging practices that have degraded the Apalachicola River. He has
   also been outspoken about the proposal to dismantle the Board of
   Regents of the state university system, which he believes will cause a
   significant decline in academic excellence and economic potential in
   Florida.

   In addition to the Intelligence Committee, Graham is a senior member of
   the powerful tax, trade and health-care-writing Finance Committee and
   the committees on Environment and Public Works, Energy and Natural
   Resources and Veterans Affairs. When he is not working, the Grahams
   divide their time between their four daughters and 10 grandchildren.

      Gubernatorial Career
      [govern2small.gif] Governor of Florida, elected 1978; reelected 1982

      Bob Graham became the 38th Governor of Florida in January, 1979. As
      Governor, one of his highest priorities was economic diversification.
      During his administration the unemployment rate in Florida remained
      well below the national average; more than one million new jobs were
      created, many of them in high-tech manufacturing. Florida's business
      climate was ranked #1 in the nation. In education, Graham increased
      resources at every level. Class sizes in public school decreased while
      teacher salaries increased. Standard test scores in 1986 showed the
      most dramatic rise in any state.

      Governor Graham pioneered environmental programs which have attracted
      national attention, including "Save Our Everglades," designed to
      restore the great "River of Grass." He expanded child care and abuse
      prevention programs, increased prenatal and neonatal medical attention
      and emergency medical facilities for infants and mothers. He expanded
      "Community Care for the Elderly," a service program which enables frail
      or infirm older citizens to remain in their homes. Graham enacted the
      most stringent drug offense and drunk driving penalties in the nation,
      including a 15-year minimum mandatory sentence for drug smuggling.

      Most Valuable Member of the Senate, the Florida Association of
      Community College's Outstanding Legislator Award, the Tropical Audubon
      Society's Conservation Award and many others.

      As a legislator, Graham was a pioneer in support of improved education.
      He authored and steered passage of a bill requiring testing for
      competency and progress in public schools. In the Legislature, Graham
      authored and helped write much of the state's current environmental
      law. As chairman of the Senate Health and Rehabilitative Services
      Committee, he focused on two key issues--more adequate services for the
      elderly and community health services.

       Business

      Senator Graham and his family have been active in Florida's economic
      development since 1920. His father founded a dairy at Pennsuco in 1932.
      The family continues to operate dairy, beef cattle and pecan farms in
      Florida and Georgia.

      With his two older brothers, Graham established the Graham Company and
      commenced the planning and development of New Town, Miami Lakes in
      1960. The population of Miami Lakes has grown to more than 22,000 with
