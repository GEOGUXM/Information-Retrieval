                         The Parallel Ocean Program

   The Parallel Ocean Program (POP) developed at LANL is one of many
   efforts in the Department of Energy's CHAMMP program aimed at increased
   understanding of the earth's climate through the use of modeling and
   high performance computing. POP has been used to perform the highest
   resolution (1/5 degree on average) global ocean simulation ever
   undertaken using the Thinking Machines CM5 computer located at LANL's
   Advanced Computing Laboratory (ACL).

   POP is a descendant of the Bryan-Cox model that is used frequently in
   ocean simulations. This earlier model has been substantially improved
   and adapted for use with massively parallel computers. Some of these
   improvements are:
     * a surface pressure formulation that allows for an unlimited number
       of land masses (with no additional computational cost) and
       unsmoothed bottom topography.
     * an implicit free surface technique that allows the air-sea
       interface to evolve freely.
     * the equations of motion are formulated and discretized to allow the
       use of any locally orthogonal horizontal grid (instead of just
       latitude/longitude) which, for example, can let the Arctic ocean be
       resolved without the standard problems of convergence of meridians
       at the North Pole.
     * the code is written in Fortran90 and is capable of running on a
       variety of parallel and serial computer architectures.

   A primary motivation for performing such high resolution simulations is
   to resolve eddy motions that can play an important role in the dynamics
   of the ocean. Two examples of this are eddies shed by the Agulhas
   Current and in meanders of the Gulf Stream.

   Currently, efforts are underway to couple POP to NCAR's Community
   Climate Model (CCM) and a sea ice model also being developed at LANL.
