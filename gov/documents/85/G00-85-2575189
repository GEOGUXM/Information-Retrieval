   I am Major Chuck Kowalewski of the Mississippi Wing CAP. I created the
   CAP Forms Online project was created in response to demands by CAP
   members for easy access to commonly used forms. It is my privilege to
   be able to serve these forms to you. I created all but a few of these
   forms, and I make no income either from this site or from the forms.
   These are ONLY the forms we use in day-to-day operations; CAPR 0-9
   defines the list. Many other forms and publications are available at
   National CAP HQ.

   All forms are in Word 2000 format. Some forms use macros specific to
   Word 2000. If you encounter problems using the forms with earlier
   versions, try downloading one of the Word for Windows file converters
   from Microsoft's website. Alternatively, a Word97 viewer/printer is
   available to members without Microsoft Word.

       has been taken; however, the user should insure that the documents
       are virus-free and of acceptable quality. The user is responsible
       for printing ALL pages and/or portions of the form. BE SURE to
       check with your Admin Officer and/or Personnel Officer before using
       these forms!
    2. Forms carry legal and context-sensitive verbiage; forms are
