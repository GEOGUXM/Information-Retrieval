Overview

   The ECT Account Services Office handles the enrollment of users into
   ECT and Laboratory-wide computer and network services. In addition to
   enrollments, the Office also handles billing changes, user
   terminations, and general inquiries regarding the ECT and Laboratory
   services for which users have registered. Account Services insures the
   unique association of computer userids to users for the services it
   manages. Additionally, Account Services manages the billing process for
   those services where ECT must recoup the cost of providing the service.
