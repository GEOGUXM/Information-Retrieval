    Launch Complex 39-A & 39-B

   Launch Complex 39's Pad A and Pad B were originally designed to support
       the Apollo program and were modified for Space Shuttle launch
       operations. Major changes included the erection of a new Fixed
       Service Structure (FSS), addition of a Rotating Service Structure
       (RSS), and the replacement of the Saturn flame deflectors with
       three new flame deflectors. The upper portion of the Saturn V
       Launch umbilical tower was removed from two of the Apollo Mobile
       Launchers and installed at the pad to serve as the FSS.
       Fuel, oxidizer, high pressure gas, electrical, and pneumatic lines
       connect the Shuttle vehicle with ground support equipment and are
       routed through the FSS, RSS and Mobile Launch Platform.
       Space Shuttle access and servicing at the pad are provided by:

     * FSS - Gaseous Hydrogen Vent Arm for electrical power and for
       venting hydrogen from the external tank.
     * RSS - Mid-Body Umbilical Unit for fuel cell servicing and life
       support functions.
     * RSS facilities for loading and off-loading payloads.
     * Hypergolic Umbilical System for servicing the Orbiter systems with
       fluids and gases.
     * Gaseous Oxygen Vent Arm for preventing ice formation atop the
       external tank.
     * Orbiter Access Arm (OAA) for crew entrance and exit.
     * MLP - Tail Service Masts for propellant loading and electrical
       power.

   The FSS is topped by a 24.4 meter (80ft) tall fiberglass lightning mast
   grounded by 335 meter (1,100ft) cables that are anchored north and
   south of the pad. The Mast provides lightning protection for pad
   structures and the Space Shuttle.

   The RSS accommodates the loading of payloads vertically at the pad. It
   is mounted on a semi-circular track which allows it to rotate through
   an arc of 120 degrees on a radius of 36.6 meters (120 ft). The RSS
   pivots from a hinge on the FSS until the RSS spacecraft changeout room
   fits flush with the Orbiters's cargo bay. This room allows payloads to
   be installed or serviced under contamination-free or "clean room"
   conditions. Click here for a better view of the RSS

   Blast-protected hypergolic storage and supply systems are provided at
   each pad, and the Launch Processing System (LPS) is used to monitor all
   aspects of vehicle and payload operations. The LPS system interconnects
   to the MLP through Hardware Interface Modules (HIM's) located in Pad
   Terminal Connection Rooms beneath the pads.

   Pads 39-A and 39-B are virtually identical and roughly octagonal in
   shape. The distance between pads is 2,657 meters (8,715 ft). The pad
   base contains 52,000 cubic meters (68,000 cubic yards) of concrete. The
   ramp leading up to the pad is inclined at a 5% grade. The flame trench
   is 13 meters (42 ft) deep, 137 meters (450ft) long and 18 meters (58
   ft) wide. The orbiter flame deflector is 11.6 meters (38ft) high, 22
   meters (72 ft) long and 17.5 meters (57.6 ft) wide. It weights 590,000
   kg (1.3 million lbs). The SRB deflector is 12.95 meters (42.5 ft) high,
   12.8 meters (42 ft) long and 17.4 meters (57 ft) wide. It weights
   499,000 kg (1.1 million lbs). The Sound Suppression Water System is
   used to protect the launch structure from the intense sound pressure of
   liftoff. Its water tank is 88.9 meters (290ft) high and has a capacity
   of 1,135,000 liters (300,000 gallons).

   There are 6 permanent and 4 extensible pedestals that are used to
   support the MLP at the pad. Dynamic loads at rebound are 3,175,200 kg
   (7,000,000 lbs) to 4,762,800 kg (10,500,000lb) at liftoff. The pad is
   lit with 5 clusters of Xenon high-intensity searchlights (total
   searchlights: 40) around the pad perimeter.

   The height of the Fixed Service Structure (FSS) is 105.7 meters (347ft)
   to the top of the lightning mast (referenced to the pad base) and the
   Rotating Service Structure (RSS) is 57.6 meters (189ft) high. The Fixed
   Service Structure (FSS) and Rotating Service Structure (RSS) on Pad 39A
   underwent a renovation between June and September 1993. Some 13,773
   gallons of paint were used on two coats and 1,866 tons of sand were
   used in the sandblasting operation.

   The LC-39 Launch complex also contains large liquid oxygen (LOX) and
   Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) storage tanks. These are large ball-shaped vacuum
   jacketed dewar bottles used to store supercold cryogenic propellants
   for the shuttle external tank. The LOX tank, located at the northwest
   corner of the pad stores 3,406,500 liters (900,000 gallons) of liquid
   oxygen at a temperature of minus 183 degress C (-298 F). The LH2 tank
   is located at the northeast corner of the pad and stores 3,218,250
   liters (850,000 gallons) of liquid hydrogen at a temperature of minus
   253 degrees C (-423 degrees F).

   The Weather Protection System protects orbiter tiles from wind blown
   debris, rain and hail. Wheeled metal doors that ride on steel beams are
   attached to the Rotating Service Structure and the Fixed Service
   Structure. Doors slide together (to within 3 inches of each other)
   between the orbiter's belly and the external tank, providing protection
   for the lower portion of the orbiter.
     * East Door, attached to the RSS measures 16 meters (53 ft) long, 8
       meters (27 ft) tall and weighs 19 metric tons (42,000 lbs).

     * West Door, attached to the FSS measures 13 meters (43 ft) long,
       11.6 meters (38ft) tall and weighs 21 metric tons (46,000 lbs)

   The top of the orbiter is shielded by an inflatable seal extending from
   the Payload Changeout Room forming a semi-circle covering 90 degrees of
   arc between the orbiter and its external tank. The sides of the
   orbiter, between the vehicle and the external tank, are protected by a
   series of 20 metal bi-fold doors that fold out from the Payload
   Changeout Room. The doors measure 24.4 meters by 1.2 meters (80ft x
   4ft).

   There is approximately 1.25 million feet of tubing and piping at Launch
   Complex 39, varying in sizes from .25 inches to 114 inches in diameter.
   This is enough pipe to reach from Orlando to Miami.
