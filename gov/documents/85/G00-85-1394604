                 CBCTR Breast Tissue Progression Microarray

   The CBCTR has designed a breast cancer Tissue micro-array (TMA) that
   can be used to investigate differences in prevalence of potential
   markers in three stages of invasive breast cancer: node-negative,
   node-positive and metastatic disease. All of the invasive cases are
   primary breast cancers with a principal histology of ductal cancer
   accessioned through the CBCTR. The arrays were designed by National
   Cancer Institute statisticians to provide high statistical power for
   studies of stage specific markers of breast cancer.

   Each TMA block consists of 288 0.6 mm cores taken from
   paraffin-embedded specimens that represent 252 breast cancer and normal
   breast specimens plus 36 controls. Each array is created in
   quadruplicate to address possible tissue heterogeneity: four cores are
   taken from each specimen block, with one core per specimen appearing in
   each of the four replicate array blocks.

   The 252 normal breast and breast cancer cores appearing on each TMA
   block include:
    1. NODE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER: 64 cores.
    2. NODE-POSITIVE BREAST CANCER: 64 cores.
    3. METASTATIC BREAST CANCER: 64 cores.
    4. DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS): 20 cores (10 from individuals
       without an invasive disease component and 10 from individuals with
       invasive disease represented elsewhere on the TMA).
    5. NORMAL BREAST TISSUE: 40 cores (20 from individuals without breast
       cancer and 20 from individuals with breast cancer represented
       elsewhere on the TMA).

   The 36 control cores appearing on each TMA block include:
    1. NORMAL NON-BREAST TISSUE: 16 cores (4 cores from each of the
       following tissue types: kidney, endometrium, prostate and
       appendix).
    2. CELL LINES: 20 cores (5 cores from each of the following cell
       lines: HT-29, PC-3, MCF-7 and T-47D). These cell lines have
       previously been characterized with regard to expression of a
       variety of markers of interest in breast cancer.

   Human Genome Research Institute Tissue Microarray Project.
