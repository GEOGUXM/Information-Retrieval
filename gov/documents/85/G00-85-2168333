   Freedom of Information Act Office (FOIA)

      The Federal Aviation Administration's Washington Headquarters Freedom
      of Information Act (FOIA) Office is located in the Office of the
      Assistant Administrator for Region and Center Operations.

   How to Make a FOIA Request

      General information regarding the FOIA law can be found at the U.S.
      Department of Justice web site. This site includes most of the Office
      of Information and Privacy documents related to policies regulating the
      government-wide FOIA program. In addition, FOIA law and guidance
      specific to the Department of Transportation can be found at the DOT
      web site. FOIA guidance specific to the Federal Aviation Administration
      is found in FAA Order 1270.1 (Adobe Acrobat format) or FAA Order 1270.1
      (HTML format), Freedom of Information Act Program.

      FAA publications and much regulatory information and data are publicly
      available and an FOIA request may not be necessary to obtain it. If you
      have questions about the need for an FOIA request, please contact the
      headquarters FOIA office.

      An FOIA request must be written and must be for FAA records. It is
      inappropriate to ask questions under the FOIA law. You may make a
      request by indicating that you are seeking records under the Freedom of
      Information Act. Each request should describe the particular record to
      the fullest extent possible. The request should describe the subject
      matter of the record, and, if known, indicate the date of the record,
      the place where it originated, and the name of the originating person
      or office. The request should state the maximum amount of fees the
      requester is willing to pay.

      Your request may be submitted on-line, by mail, facsimile, or in
      person. A FOIA request cannot be made by telephone. If your request is
      mailed, the envelope in which the request is sent should be marked
      "FOIA" and mailed to:
