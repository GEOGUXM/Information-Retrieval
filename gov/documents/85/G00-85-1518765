   Regulations

   The Flower Gardens are a treasure that belongs to all of us. To protect
   the resources within the Sanctuary for current and future generations,
   the following activities are regulated:
     * injuring, removing, possessing, or attempting to injure or remove
       living or non-living Sanctuary resources
     * feeding fish and certain methods of taking fish
     * vessel anchoring and mooring
     * discharging or depositing polluting materials within the Sanctuary
     * discharging or depositing polluting materials outside the Sanctuary
       boundaries that subsequently enter the Sanctuary and injures a
       Sanctuary resource or quality
     * exploring for, developing, or producing oil, gas or minerals within
       the "No Activity Zone" established by the Minerals Management
       Service
     * altering the seabed or constructing, placing or abandoning any
       structure or material on the seabed

   For details regarding restrictions on the above activities, or to
   request permission to engage in a restricted activity, contact the
   Sanctuary office. Permission to engage in restricted activities will be
   considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the need
   for the activity, benefits expected to be gained and impacts to
   Sanctuary resources.

   To view the entire set of regulations, see the Code of Federal
   Regulations.


   Enforcement

   Due to the distance from shore, the Sanctuary primarily relies on sport
   diving vessels and the nearby oil and gas platforms to alert the staff
   of potential problems such as illegal anchoring, fishing activity, and
   spills. Enforcement is conducted by the US Coast Guard.
