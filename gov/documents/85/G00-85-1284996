   * Joint Archive for Sea Level (JASL) - The NODC and the University of
   Hawaii Sea Level Center (UHSLC) cooperate to provide access to sea
   level data. The data are hourly, daily, and monthly sea level values
   from stations in tropical and subtropical areas of the Pacific,
   Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. Most data are from tide gauges but some
   data are derived from bottom-mounted pressure gauges. The data are
   primarily from the 1980s, although earlier data has been added when
   possible.

   * Sea Level Data CD-ROM - This disc holds hourly, daily, and monthly
   TOGA sea level data from 289 stations through July 1994 (recent data
   can be obtained online from JASL, above). It also contains sea level
   data (monthly and annual mean values) from approximately 1500 tide
   guage stations around the world. The latter were provided to the NODC
   by the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level, Bidston, UK.

   * Global Sea Level Derived from Satellite Altimeter Data - The NOAA
   Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry provides access to altimeter-derived
   sea level analyses, as well as satellite altimeter datasets and data
   products.
     * Geosat Altimeter Data: Enhanced JGM-3 Geophysical Data Records on
       CD-ROM (Geodetic and Exact Repeat Missions).

   * Tide Predictions and Water Level Data from the National Ocean Service
   (NOS).

   * Customized datasets of sea level data can also be obtained by
   contacting NODC User Services.
