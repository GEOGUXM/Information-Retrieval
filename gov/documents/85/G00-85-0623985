   September 4, 1998 Aquarium test helps scientists look for life in
   extreme environments By MARY HARDIN NASA's search for life elsewhere in
   the solar system has brought JPL space scientists to the giant kelp
   forest exhibit at the Monterey Bay Aquarium to test a new scientific
   probe that is a precursor to one that might one day look for life in
   oceans that may exist on Jupiter's icy moon Europa. JPL researchers
   have been conducting these first-time engineering tests at the
   California aquarium as a precursor to an experiment that will place a
   scientific probe in an underwater Hawaiian volcanic vent later this
   year. The Lo'ihi Underwater Volcanic Vent Mission Probe will
   investigate an undersea vol- cano located 27 kilometers (20 miles) east
   of the Big Island of Hawaii at a depth of about 1,300 meters (4,250
   feet). "The purpose of using the Monterey Bay Aquarium kelp tank is to
   begin testing the instruments in an aquatic environment that con- tains
   some biological material that will stimu- late and test the hardware,"
   said JPL's Dr. Lonne Lane, principal investigator for the experiment.
   "The information to be gathered from these experiments at the aquarium
   and later in Hawaii will prepare us for future mis- sions to difficult
   places like Antarctica's Lake Vostok (under 4 kilometers [2.5 miles] of
   ice), and below the surface of Jupiter's ice-encrust- ed moon Europa."
   The use of the aquarium also provides a cost-effective, controlled
   environment for this first experiment. Open-ocean opportuni- ties with
   deep-diving submersibles are extremely limited and often expensive,
   Lane explained. "As part of JPL's new astrobiology effort, we are
   bringing new instrumentation and approaches to areas that in the past
   have been deemed either very difficult or impossible to explore," he
   said. "The long-range goal of this experiment is a multi-faceted
   investigation of deep-ocean vol- canic vents and sea floor cracks from
   which very hot water flow out into the deep ocean. NASA's search for
   life elsewhere in the solar system brought space scientists to the

   empowerment through astronomy By MARK WHALEN As another summer vacation
   comes to an end, yet another group of local school teachers has
   completed a JPL summer program that uses astronomy to revitalize their
   interest in teaching science and enrich curriculum for their students.
   "Teachers Touch the Sky," an annual summer program now in its fifth
   year, engages teachers of grades 3 through 10 by combining hands-on
   activ- ities with lectures by JPL scientists. "We try to teach
   scientific processes rather than a body of facts," said Dr. Bonnie
   Buratti of JPL, principal investigator of the program. "When the
   teachers learn science by doing, they become experts in their own
   classroom and communicate this excitement for science to their
   students." Seventeen teachers-representing school dis- tricts in
   Pasadena, La Cañada, Glendale, Temple City and Los Angeles, as well as
   a few private schools-participated in the week-long program during the
   first week of August. Six of the teachers reprised their participation
   from previous years. When the program started in 1994 and the Magellan
   mission to Venus was still in progress, Buratti led the teachers in
   creating a Venus "topography box" out of papier mâche, a contour model
   that related an analogy to radar and where one might predict an area to
   land a spacecraft. The same activity has now PHOTO BY DUTCH SLAGER /
   JPL PHOTO LAB come to be known as the Titan topography box, named for
   the Saturnian moon. Teachers Touch the Sky participants at JPL prepare
   to work on Mars water erosion experiments. Other activities that have
