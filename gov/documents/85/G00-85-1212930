                               SAGE III Launch


   NASA's Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE III) instrument
   is mounted aboard the Russian Meteor-3M spacecraft. The spacecraft was
   launched from the Russian launch facility at Baikonur, Kazakhstan on
   December 10, 2001 at 12:18:57 EST (17:18:57 UTC).

   The payload was lifted into orbit by a Ukrainian-built Zenit-2 rocket.
   The Zenit-2 rocket is a two-stage launch vehicle that uses a kerosene
   and oxygen fuel mixture. It stands approximately 57 meters in length,
   and has a normal launch weight of about 460 tons.

   The SAGE III/Meteor-3M mission spacecraft was inserted into a
   sun-synchronous orbit with a nominal altitude of 1020 km and equatorial
   ascending node crossing time of approximately 9 AM.

   This orbit results in the spacecraft passing over a given point on the
   Earth's surface at about the same time each day, and enables the SAGE
   III instrument to observe sunrises and sunsets in the polar regions.

   The images at right show the completed vehicle being transported to the
   launch site, and preparations that took place the day before the
   launch.
