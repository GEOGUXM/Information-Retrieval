   New! Supplement: Development of Injury Criteria for the Assessment of
   Advanced Automotive Restraint Systems - II a image file of pdf
   (208 Final Rule Docket: NHTSA-00-7013)
   In the SNPRM on advanced air bags, NHTSA proposed a comprehensive set
       of injury criteria for evaluating the potential for injury to the
       head, neck, chest and lower extremities for the various dummy
       sizes, ranging from the 1-year-old child to the 50th percentile
       male. This supplemental technical paper summarizes the comments
       received related to injury criteria, provides the agency's
       responses to the comments, and discusses the various performance
       limits implemented in the final rule.

   Final Rule Nij (Version 10) Reference Implementation (EXE file)
   *Self-extracting ZIP file: This code is a reference implementation of
       the Final Rule Nij (Version 10) injury criteria that was written
       for purposes of clarity and no consideration has been made for
       speed. style, or efficiency. The Standard C++ library was used to
       avoid any confusion due to c-style memory allocation.
       Program Input: Three ascii x-y files, where each line of the input
       file contains two floating point values, one for the time and one
       for the y value
       *** All three files must have the same number of points and the
       same time data ***
       *** All input data must be unfiltered and will be filtered within
       this program ***
       Program Output: The Nij injury criteria, the time of Peak injury.
