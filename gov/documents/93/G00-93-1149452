   Gamma-ray photon energies range from 20 keV and up, encompassing the
   highest energies in the electromagnetic spectrum. Produced in extreme
   astrophysical environments, celestial gamma-rays are not easily
   scattered or destroyed offering direct tracers of fundamental physical
   processes. LHEA scientists and engineers have had extensive involvement
   in gamma-ray instrument development incorporating scintillator and
   spark chamber technologies as well as recently developed solid state
   cadmium zinc telluride array detectors. Past LHEA supported gamma-ray
   missions include the GRIS balloon experiment and the Compton
   Observatory's EGRET instrument. Present and future missions include
   TGRS/WIND, INTEGRAL, Swift, and GLAST. The unique LHEA supported GCN
   program currently provides rapid world wide electronic notification of
   transient events related to gamma-ray astronomy.

   Cosmic rays, particles that have been accelerated to high energies, can
   originate at the sun, in interplanetary space, or in supernova remnants
   and other energetic events in the Galaxy and beyond. Although cosmic
   rays have been studied for many decades, the specific sources,
   acceleration processes, and their propagation are still not well
   understood, and are the subject of ongoing research here in LHEA.
   Cosmic rays are a unique sample of matter from different regions of the
   universe, as well as providing important probes of the dynamics and
   evolution of the heliosphere and the Galaxy. Technologies include
   silicon solid state detectors, silicon strip detectors, and magnet
   spectrometers with Cerenkov detectors, scintillators, and
   time-of-flight systems. Current and approved missions are EPACT on
   WIND, SIS and CRIS on ACE, IMPACT on Stereo and the ISOMAX, Nightglow,
   and TIGER balloon instruments. Future missions currently under study
   include ACCESS and OWL.
