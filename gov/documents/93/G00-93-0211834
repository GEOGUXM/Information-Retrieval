                           Accessibility Statement

        The Transmission Business Line (TBL) of the Bonneville Power
        Administration (BPA) is committed to making every document on its World
        Wide Web server accessible to the widest possible audience, including
        persons with visual disabilities.

        We work with the BPA's own accessibility specialists to insure that our
        documents are, to the maximum extent feasible, accessible to persons
        using special screen reading software and hardware.

        While the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) used to create World Wide
        Web pages is generally accessible for persons using screen reading
        devices, you need to be careful in the construction of HTML documents
        to insure maximum accessibility. Essentially everything that you need
        to know about web page accessibility is found on the web site of the
        W3C Web Accessibility Initiative.

        Many of the documents on our web server are in ASCII or Microsoft Word
        6.5 or 2000 formats. These formats are generally accessible to persons
        using screen reading software. We also have a large number of documents
        as Adobe Acrobat PDF (Portable Document Format) files.

     ADOBE ACROBAT PORTABLE DOCUMENT FORMAT (PDF) FILES

        Persons using screen reading devices generally cannot directly read
        documents in PDF format. Adobe Systems, Inc., provides a free
        translation service through their Access web pages which will translate
        PDF files to web pages (HTML documents). This can be used in one of
        three ways:
          * The user can go to the Access server and fill out a form. When this
            form is submitted, the server will go get the PDF document,
            translate it, and return it to the user.   [Instructions]
          * The user can send an email message to the Access server, giving the
            address of the document to be translated. The server will then get
            this document and translate it to either a web page or a text
            (ASCII) document. Note that this is the only one of the three
            options that also gives the ability to produce a text document from
            the PDF file.   [Instructions]
          * For systems which are not connected to the Internet, Adobe has a
            free downloadable accessibility plug-in, called Adobe Access, for
            use with the latest versions of the Adobe Acrobat Reader for
            Microsoft Windows 3.1, Windows 95/98, or Windows NT. This plug-in
            helps to overcome some of the problems of reading PDF documents
            with screen readers, but for systems with Internet access, Adobe
            recommends using the on-line Access translation service instead.

        These methods of making PDF files accessible are adequate for many
        documents. However, they are not adequate for PDF documents in which
        content is included in graphics files or for especially complex
        formatting. In these cases, we provide an alternative format for use
        with screen readers -- an ASCII, Microsoft Word, or HTML version.

        We have one general exception to our policy of making accessible
        versions available for all PDF documents. We are using the Adobe
        Acrobat PDF format as a means of distributing government forms. These
        are electronic images of the forms which are intended to be printed and
        used as any other paper form, and do not lend themselves to any
        nongraphical representation.

        Comments on our accessibility policies are invited, and should be sent
        to the TBL Webteam at <tblweb@bpa.gov>.
