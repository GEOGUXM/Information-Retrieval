VA Cost Data

     Researchers undertaking economic analysis have a variety of data
     sets to choose from.   This document describes databases located at
     the VA Austin Automation Center.  These include the VA General
     Ledger (FMS), the Cost Distribution Report (CDR), utilization files,
     fee basis files, and data from the VA fixed asset package and the
     Decision Support System (DSS).  In addition, there is a file with
     estimates of patient level costs created by the Allocation Resource
     Center, and non-VA health care files posted at Austin by the
     Management Science Group.

     Economic researchers should also be aware that there are additional
     data sources not on the Austin system, including data in the VA
     computerized medical records system, VISTA, the national Pharmacy
     Benefits Management system, and other data sources.

     Financial Management System (FMS).  This is the summary of the VA
     general ledger.  Information on this system is found in Volume IV of
     the Blue Books that document VA databases.  A copy of this may be
     found at the web site of the VA Information Resource Center (VIREC)
     web site: http://www.virec.research.med.va.gov/

     FMS is a source of VA nationwide data that can be used for cost
     analysis.  For example, the analyst can find the national average
     annual cost of different types of staff, or the average cost of
     staff at a particular local VA medical center.

     PAID.  The PAID system contains information on VA payroll, with data
     on the salaries and benefits of individual employees.  The
     information is highly confidential, and it is extremely difficult to
     gain access to these data.

     Cost Distribution Report (CDR).  The Cost Distribution Report (CDR)
     allocates cost reported in the general ledger (FMS) to estimate the
     cost of VA departments, including patient care departments and other
     units.  These allocations are based on service chief estimates of
     staff activities.  While there is concern about the accuracy of CDR
     cost estimates, they are the only historical and comprehensive
     information on relating VA expenditures to types of patient care.

     VA Utilization files.  Economics researchers need utilization data
     to estimate health care costs.  Key files include data on hospital
     stays found in the Patient Treatment File, data on outpatient visits
     in the Outpatient Care Files, and information on the acuity of
     long-term care patients found in the Patient Assessment File.

     We tabulated information in the Patient Treatment File on VA stays.
     This Excel spreadsheet provides national annual totals for each bed
     section between 1993 and 2000. It gives the number of days of stay
     and the number of segments of stay in each PTF bedsection (a
     location that is roughly equivalent to a ward). A single stay may
     involve days in one or more bedsections; we counted the records for
     each segment of stay in each bedsection (records in the patient
     treatment bedsection files.

     We tabulated information in the Outpatient Care file. This Excel
     spreadsheet provides the national annual totals of the number of
     visits to each VA outpatient clinic stop between 1993 and 2000. A
     clinic stop is a 3-digit code that identifies the location of care,
     these tabulations include a count of both primary and credit stops.
     Although credit clinic stops have not been used consistently by all
     VA medical centers, we included them in this tabulation to create a
     consistent data series that goes back to 1993.

     Allocation Resource Center files.   The VA Allocation Resource
     Center has created files that estimate the cost of health incurred
     by individual patients.  These data represent a measure of workload
     that is used in the VA budget allocation process.  These cost
     estimates are based on the CDR; they do not report the cost of
     individual health care encounters.

     Fee basis files.  The fee basis files report the cost of care
     provided under contract to VA.  There are separate files for
     inpatient stays, inpatient ancillary services, outpatient care,
     pharmacy, and travel.  While there is some information
     characterizing hospital stays (in the Non-VA PTF file)  little
     information is available on other types of health care reported in
     these files.  Care provided in state veterans homes and under VA
     sharing agreements are not reported in these data.

     Fixed Asset Package.  The Fixed Asset Package tells the acquisition
     cost, useful life, depreciation, and undepreciated balance of all VA
     capital assets.

     Decision Support System (DSS).  The Decision Support System includes
     economic and clinical data on all VA facilities.  Although detailed
     production data reside at Austin, access to these data requires
     permission from each individual facility.  A national extract has
     been created with encounter level summary cost data from all VA
     facilities.

     Non-VA files.  Among the non-VA files available at Austin Automation
     Center are Medicare Cost Reports, American Hospital Association
     Survey, ZIP Code Files, and state hospital discharge reports.  More
     information on these files may be obtained by contacting the
     Management Science Group at: http://world.std.com/~mgtsci/


     DATASETS NOT AT AUSTIN:

     Database of VA facilities.  The Veteran Administration Site Tracking
     system (VAST) providers the location and characteristics of VA
     facilities and contract providers.  This file was created by VA
     Planning Systems Support Group (PSSG) in Gainesville, FL.

     Pharmacy Benefits Management Data base.  The Pharmacy Benefits
     Management Data base contains information on each outpatient
     prescription filled by VA.  These data can be accessed by contacting
     Pharmacy Benefits Management Group in Hines, IL at (708) 202-2079
     ext. 2-1213.  Information about the file may also be found at the
     VIREC web site
     http://www.virec.research.med.va.gov/DATABASES/PBM.HTM.
