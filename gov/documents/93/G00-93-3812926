   DOT HS 809 091 Traffic Safety Facts 1999 U.S. Department of
   Transportation National Highway Traffic Older Population Safety
   Administration There are more than 25 million people age 70 years and
   older in the United States. In 1999, this age group made up 9 percent
   of the total U.S. resident population, compared with 8 percent in 1989.
   From 1989 to 1999, this older segment of the population grew twice as
   fast as the total population. There were 18.5 million older licensed
   drivers in 1999 - a 39 percent increase from the number in 1989. In
   contrast, the total number of licensed drivers increased by only 13
   percent from 1989 to 1999. Older drivers made up 10 percent of all
   licensed drivers in 1999, compared with 8 percent in 1989. In 1999,
   171,000 older individuals were injured in traffic crashes, accounting
   for 5 percent of all the people injured in traffic crashes during the
   year. These older individuals made up 13 percent of all traffic
   fatalities, 13 percent of all vehicle occupant fatalities, and 18
   percent of all pedestrian fatalities. Most traffic fatalities involving
   older drivers in 1999 occurred during the daytime (82 percent), on
   weekdays (71 percent), and involved another vehicle (75 percent). "In
   1999, older In two-vehicle fatal crashes involving an older driver and
   a younger driver, people made up the vehicle driven by the older person
   was more than 3 times as likely to be the one that was struck (58
   percent and 19 percent, respectively). 9 percent of the In 44 percent
   of these crashes, both vehicles were proceeding straight at the
   resident population time of the collision. In 27 percent, the older
   driver was turning left - but accounted for 7 times as often as the
   younger driver. 13 percent of all Older drivers involved in fatal
   crashes had the lowest proportion of traffic fatalities and
   intoxication - with blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) of 0.10 grams
   per 18 percent of all deciliter (g/dl) or greater - of all adult
   drivers. Fatally injured older pedestrian fatalities." pedestrians also
   had the lowest intoxication rate of all adult pedestrian fatalities.

   1999 - Older Population 3 When driver fatality rates are calculated on
   the basis of estimated annual travel, the highest rates are found among
   the youngest and oldest drivers. Compared with the fatality rate for
   drivers 25 through 69 years old, the rate for drivers in the oldest
   group is 9 times as high. Figure 3. Driver Fatality Rates by Age and
