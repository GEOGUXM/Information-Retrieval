                 Ergonomics Announcement To Be Made At Later Date

      WASHINGTON - The Department of Labor announced today that, in the wake
      of last week's events, the Department will temporarily postpone the
      announcement of a plan of action on ergonomics.

      The announcement, which was expected this month, will be made later
      this Fall.

      In July, the Department conducted three forums in Virginia, Illinois,
      and California, to solicit public comment on ergonomics. Witness
      testimony and written comments are under review.

      Staff of the Department and the Occupational Health and Safety
      Administration have been heavily involved in the rescue and recovery
      efforts at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon during the past
      week, which has prevented the Department from devoting full attention
      to this important issue.

                                        ###
