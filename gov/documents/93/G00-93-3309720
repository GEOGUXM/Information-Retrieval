   Independent Commentary...
   Dec. 21 - Inside Washington Today: Winners and losers in farm bill
   debate
   By Jim Wiesemeyer, via a special arrangement with Sparks Companies,
   Inc.

   Frustration prevails thus far in the aftermath of the Senate's
   inability to conclude a final vote on a new omnibus farm bill. I've
   been asked by many readers to assess the so-called "winners" and
   "losers" of the farm bill debate thus far.

   House Ag Committee Chairman Larry Combest (R-Texas): Mr. Combest was
   the first one to accurately predict and act on the impact that
   declining U.S. government revenue -- and eventual budget deficits --
   would have on the farm bill debate. He worked with House Budget
   Committee Chairman Jim Nussle (R-Iowa), another "winner," to get an
   additional $73.5 billion in farm bill spending above the around $97
   billion 10-year baseline.

   Delivering a bipartisan farm bill... Combest is also a winner because
   he surprised some veteran farm bill watchers when he delivered a farm
   bill proposal out of his Ag Committee and got it passed in a bipartisan
   vote on the House floor on Oct. 5 -- a time frame that virtually
   shocked most long-time farm bill observers. And he did it despite a
   strongly worded Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) position
   against the House farm bill.
   Rep. Charlie Stenholm (D-Texas) is a winner because unlike the Senate
   Ag Committee, the chairman and ranking member of the Ag panel
   successfully cleared a bipartisan farm bill commodity title out of the
   Committee and that made the vote on the House floor a lot easier than
   if a partisan bill was approved, as was the case in the Senate and its
   disastrous floor developments.

   Call for Senate action:
   Noting Senators' pessimism over finalizing the farm bill in 2001, House
   Ag Chairman Combest suggested a timely option ... and praised the
   response by Arkansas' Senator Tim Hutchinson.

   House Ag Chairman Combest and Ranking Minority Member Charlie Stenholm
   have been supportive of timely action -- beginning when the Senate Ag
   Committee set out to write its farm bill version November 6, 2001.

   Background:
   The House Farm Bill was introduced in the Senate in a bipartisan manner
   November 9th

   One month previously, the House Agriculture Committee's 2001 Farm Bill,
   "The Farm Security Act," (H.R. 2646) was approved on Friday, October 5,
   2001 in a 291 to 120 vote by the U.S. House of Representatives.

   The House had defeated an earlier attempt to move crop support away
   from producers.

   Review the House of Representatives debate and the votes:
     * during the first day of debate on Wednesday
     * during the second day of debate on Thursday
     * during the final day of vote on final passage Friday

   The House Agriculture Committee had completed writing the bill with
   voice vote on July 27, 2001. The Committee's farm bill proposal was
   introduced by Larry Combest, Chairman of the House Agriculture
   Committee with Ranking Minority Member Charlie Stenholm.
