   We have dramatically remodelled our site to better enhance load times,
   legibility, and ease of navigation. We participate in the ANYBrowser
   Campaign for an non-browser specific web, and therefore allpages within
   this site have been designed with no specific browser in mind. We are
   proud to be one of the major taxi sites on the web and one of the only
   sites dedicated to their preservation, attracting 30 to 60 people a day
   on average without the use of banner networks or other forms of
   advertising. We hope you will enjoy your visit and that you will be
   able to find the information you are seeking. We appreciate all
   feedback, negative and positive, about the site and pages within at:
   britishcabs@osfn.org.
