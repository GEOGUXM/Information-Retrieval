   Snow and Ice Control Brochure (862 KB)

   A sampling of information is listed below.


                                Snow Removal


   "Snow removal and ice control shall be performed as necessary in order
   to facilitate the movement and safety of public traffic and shall be
   done in accordance with the best management practices outlined herein
   with particular emphasis given to environmentally sensitive areas."

   Adopted July 1992.  Outlined in Caltrans Report to the Legislature in
   response to Chapter 318, Statutes of 1991 (Hauser), "The Use of Deicing
   Chemicals on California State Highways", July 1992."


   Snow and ice control is important on every mountainous route within
   California; however, certain routes carry heavy seasonal recreational
   traffic as well as high volumes of truck traffic. These routes require
   extensive snow-fighting activity to keep open during heavy snow storms.

                               Chain Controls

                            High Mountain Passes

   Chain controls are generally used during snowstorms and usually end
   soon after the end of the storm. However, with sunshine, the snow and
   ice pack will begin to melt resulting in slush on the pavement that is
   difficult to negotiate without tire chains.
