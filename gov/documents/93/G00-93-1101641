   What is the Mission of the Impaired Driving Division?

   The mission of the Impaired Driving Division is to develop partnerships
   to cooperatively save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce
   traffic-related health care and economic costs resulting from impaired
   driving (alcohol and other drugs).

   Goal: We are committed to reducing alcohol-related fatalities to no
   more than 11,000 by 2005.

   Saturation Patrols & Sobriety Checkpoints: A How-to Guide for Planning
   and Publicizing Impaired Driving Enforcement Efforts (posted 11-22-01)

   Using Smart Card Technology to Prevent Sales of Alcohol to Underage
   Persons (posted 10-05-01)
   This report documents the results of a demonstration and evaluation
   project conducted through a cooperative agreement between NHTSA and
   Traffic Injury Research Foundation of Ottawa, Ontario Canada. The
   purpose of the demonstration was to examine the effectiveness of smart
   card technology (i.e., magnetic stripe on the drivers license) as a
   means of providing alcohol retailers with a simple, efficient and
   reliable system for verifying the age of youthful looking customers as
   well as the authenticity of their identification. The overall objective
   is to reduce the alcohol-related crashes involving youth by reducing
   sales of alcoholic beverages to those under 21.
