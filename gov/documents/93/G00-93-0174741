    Privacy & Security Notice

   Thank you for visiting the FirstGov website and reviewing our privacy
   policy. Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect no personal
   information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to
   provide that information to us.

   Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website:
    Information Collected and Stored Automatically
   If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website,
       read pages, or download information, we will gather and store
       certain information about your visit automatically. This
       information does not identify you personally. We automatically
       collect and store only the following information about your visit:

    1. The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a
       private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect
       from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a
       number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
       are surfing the Web) from which you access our website;
    2. The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
    3. The date and time you access our site;
    4. The pages you visit; and
    5. If you linked to the FirstGov website from another website, the
       address of that website.

   We use this information to help us make the site more useful to
   visitors -- to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the
   types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record
   information about individuals and their visits.
    If You Send Us Personal Information
   If you choose to provide us with personal information -- by filling out
       a form with your personal information and submitting it to us
       through the website -- we use that information to respond to your
       message and to help us get you the information you have requested.
       We only share the information you give us with another government
       agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise
       required by law. Moreover, we do not create individual profiles
       with the information you provide or give it to any private
       organizations. FirstGov does not collect information for commercial
       marketing.

    Site Security
         1. For site security purposes and to ensure that this service
            remains available to all users, this government computer
            system employs commercial software programs to monitor network
            traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change
            information, or otherwise cause damage.
         2. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other
            attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage
            habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are
            scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National
            Archives and Records Administration guidelines.
         3. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change
            information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be
            punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and
            the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
