                         Want to improve your site?
              Help us validate our draft  usability guidelines!

   In order to develop a successful web site, a transit authority must not
        only ensure that the site includes the features needed by its
     customers, but that the site's user interface is designed such that
         customers can access and use the features. The Intelligent
    Transportation System Joint Program Office has asked the USDOT Volpe
   Center to develop, validate and evaluate guidelines for user interfaces
                            of transit web sites.

    If you want to learn more or might be interested in participating in
   the validation and evaluation, please CONTACT US. If you have employed
       user-centered design techniques in the development of the user
      interface for your agencys web site and want to share what youve
                       learned, please pass it along.

       The first phase of the study will develop draft guidelines for
   validation by transit agencies interested in improving their sites. The
    draft guidelines will be developed by doing usability testing on web
     sites representing competing design solutions. The draft guidelines
               should be ready for validation by August 2001.
