                             Assembly Bill 2107

   Effective July 1, 2001, Chapter 442, Statutes of 2000 (Assembly Bill
   2107, Scott), strengthens the Elder Abuse and Dependent Civil
   Protection Act with respect to selling insurance and financial products
   to elders and clarifies the definition of financial abuse.  (The
   definition of "elders" is any person residing in this state that is 65
   years of age or older.)

   At the time of the enactment of this law, a life agent is required to
   make specified disclosures about the potential consequences of entering
   into financial transactions related to an elder's potential eligibility
   for Medi-Cal coverage and prohibits a life agent from negligently
   misrepresenting a product based on its treatment under Medi-Cal.
