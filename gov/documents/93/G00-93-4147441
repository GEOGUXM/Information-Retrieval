   The Digital Signal Processing Research Group is one of the eleven
   groups in the Communications Systems Research Section (view the section
   organization chart) headed by Dr. Steve Townes. Main activities of the
   group include theoretical analysis and software simulations for
   innovative receiver technologies and providing technical specifications
   for the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS). The
   group developed the prototype receiver for the Deep Space Network (DSN)
   and provides a wide range of support to tiny transponder development,
   Deep-Space-One mission, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission, Galileo
   mission, Develop New Product (DnP), Flight System Testbed (FST), and
   Antenna Arraying development. The group comprises 10 Ph.D.s, 4 M.S.s,
   and 2 B.S.s and has the capability to participate in all phases of
   projects: concept, prototype development, and hardware validation. The
   group has the latest tools for simulating complicated receiver system
   performances as well.
