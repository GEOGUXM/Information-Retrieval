   Employment Opportunities

   The following is a list of current employment and collaboration
   opportunities available in the Polymers Division. Please contact us for
   more information.


   Post Doctoral Opportunities

      National Research Council Program
      The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in
      cooperation with the National Research Council (NRC), offers awards for
      post-doctoral research in the diverse fields of physical science in
      which NIST is actively involved. The NRC web site lists the research
      opportunities which are currently available in the Polymers Division of
      NIST. These represent the sort of projects that post-doc candidates and
      NIST advisors can work on. It is not exhaustive and is truly only
      limited by the intelligence and imagination of the post-doctoral
      candidate. Please note that NIST only accepts applications, due in
      January, for the February review cycle. For additional information and
      contact information, visit the NRC web site below.

   Visiting Scientist Positions

      International Guest Researchers
      The Polymers Division occasionally has opportunities for post-doctoral
      level researchers from outside the U.S. to work in collaboration with
      NIST scientists. The duration of the stay at NIST can vary from several
      months up to three years. Specific opportunities vary from year to
      year, but fall into the areas of interest of the Division.

   Collaboration Opportunities

   The NIST Polymers Division provides opportunities for industry,
   academia, and other R&D laboratories for collaboration on scientific
   research. We rely heavily on the input provided by outside industry and
   technical community to set our research priorities, and encourage you
   to contact us. The various cooperative research arrangements range from
   formal agreements to informal collaborations.

   Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA)

   Within the NIST CRADA program, the Polymers Division seeks industrial
   partners to work together to overcome technical obstacles to the
   implementation and use of polymers and plastics by US industry and in
   international trade. Emphasis is on new measurement methods and
   standard materials that advance the goals of rendering US industry more
   competitive in the global economy. The CRADA itself is designed to
   protect the intellectual property rights of both NIST and its
   industrial partner.

   Consortia

   In certain technology sectors we find that the problems are large and
   cut across many industries. In such cases, the Polymers Division will
   set up consortia in which multiple partners join to solve problems of
   mutual interest. These are often covered by CRADA's with the industrial
   partners.

   Informal Collaborations

   Often, we discover that our research overlaps with ongoing research in
   other laboratories. In such a case, individual scientists become
   "partners of opportunity" and NIST and the industrial or academic
   partner perform joint research with outcomes that are of expected
   benefit to both groups. When intellectual property is involved, these
   can be covered by CRADA's. Often, however, these collaborations arise
   spontaneously and the researchers jointly pursue the work when
   management can concur.

   Contact Us

   Potential collaborators should usually contact the principal
   investigator in the appropriate research area. Requests for general
   information and referrals can be addressed to polymers@nist.gov
