                 Calcification and the Oceanic Carbon Cycle:
           High-throughput Sequencing of Emiliania huxleyi cDNAs.

                              PROJECT ABSTRACT

          The phytoplankton Emiliania huxleyi is of global significance as
   the most widespread member of a class which forms elaborate plates of
   calcium carbonate called coccoliths. Blooms of E. huxleyi, often
   extending over 100,000 km^2, are responsible for the long-term trapping
   of carbon in coccolith plates, which sink to the ocean floor; over
   geological time-scales this has led to chalk or limestone rock
   formation. The white blooms also reflect sunlight and heat, and so cool
   the ocean slightly.

          Despite its significance to the oceanic carbon cycle and
   planetary albedo, E. huxleyi has not been subjected to detailed
   molecular genetic analysis. Molecular tools for shipboard analysis of
   bloom dynamics are also lacking. Accordingly, we propose to use
   high-throughput cDNA sequencing to discover genes that, in particular,
   are involved in expressing the protein machinery for coccolith
   formation. We will also begin construction of a physical map of the E.
   huxleyi genome. Selected cDNA clones for several putative nuclear,
   chloroplast and mitochondrial genes will be used as probes to identify
   their corresponding homologues in genomic libraries. We propose to
   completely sequence several genes of each class to provide information
   about the size and frequency of E. huxleyi introns. Several
   differentially regulated genes and their upstream promoter regions also
   will be completely sequenced to begin development of a database for
   analysis of E. huxleyi regulatory sequences. We will construct
   high-density cDNA arrays from the sequenced libraries, and provide
   these to members of the E. huxleyi research community for shipboard
   analysis of E. huxleyi gene expression.

   BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE

          The coccolithophore, Emiliania huxleyi, is one of the most
   abundant calcite-producing organisms on earth and may play significant
   roles in the global climate change and in the oceanic carbon-cycle.
   Emiliania has a cosmopolitan distribution, inhabiting both open and
   coastal waters. Blooms of Emiliania can be detected from space because
   the calcite plates produced by the organism increase the local ocean
   albedo from ~7.5% to 9.7%. When averaged globally and annually
   Emiliania blooms increase the planetary albedo by only 0.001% which is
   equivalent to a 0.002 W/m^2 decrease in incoming solar energy. The
   calcite plates also scatter incoming radiation, trapping heat in the
   upper layer of the ocean that increases the local vertical
   stratification. The importance of this effect on the dynamics of the
   upper ocean and climate has not yet been established. Coccolithophores
   may increase cloud albedo because they produce dimethyl sulphide (DMS)
   which can eventually end up as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) that
   allow more clouds to form. Again, the importance of this climate
   forcing has not yet been established. Coccolithophores play a special
   role in the oceanic carbon cycle because they both reduce CO[2] to
   organic matter and take up bicarbonate (HCO[3]^-) to form their calcite
   plates.

          Broecker and Peng (1982) argue that at the most basic level, the
   internal cycling of carbon in the open ocean is controlled by the
   production and transport of two biogenic forms: > soft= (i.e. organic
   tissue) and >hard = parts (CaCO[3] shells). In the present-day ocean,
   for every four moles of carbon which are taken up by photosynthesis and
   subsequently sink as organic tissue, roughly one mole is taken up and
   sinks as CaCO[3] ^-. The >hard parts= are produced by bio-calcification
   in coccoliths, forams and pteropods. Coccolithophores are a major
   contributor to the carbonate in deep sea sediments. In the Northeast
   Atlantic during the last glacial-interglacial cycle, coccoliths
   comprised 70-80% of the total calcite deposited during interglacial
   times (Kreveld et al, 1996). Milliman (1993) estimates a global burial
   rate of 0.46 Gt calcite-C/year.

           The formation of coccoliths also influences the partial
   pressure of CO[2] in the ambient water and increases the exchange of
   CO[2] from the water to the air. The chemical reaction for the
   formation of the CaCO[3] plates is:

   Ca^++ + 2HCO[3]^- --> CaCO[3] + H[2]O + CO[2]

   This bio-calcification clearly reduces the amount of dissolved carbon
   (HCO[3]^-) by producing solid calcium carbonate (CaCO[3]).
   Bio-calcification also affects the thermodynamic equilibria of the
   sea-water carbonate system by reducing the alkalinity which in turn
   increases the partial pressure of CO[2]. In the real ocean,
   simultaneous photosynthesis and biocalcification exert opposing
   influences on the partial pressure of CO[2]. Although there are few
   direct measurements of both the changes in the carbonate system and the
   photosynthesis occurring in blooms, the net effect of bio-calcification
   will be to increase the partial pressure of CO[2] and increase the
   exchange of CO[2 ]from the water to the atmosphere (Bates et al.,
   1996).

          It is widely recognized that Emiliania huxleyi plays a special
   role in the current ocean carbon cycle and an interdisciplinary
   scientific community has formed to understand both the autoecology of
   the organism and the dynamics of its blooms in nature (EHUX 1995).
   Despite the geological and climatological importance of
   bio-calcification, the biochemical mechanism underlying this process is
   poorly understood and has only recently been addressed.

   Coccolithogenesis

          In E. huxleyi, coccoliths are formed by a specific non-motile
   cell type, the C-cells. The life-cycle may involve two other
   morphotypes: motile S-cells, which bear calcareous plates and are
   thought to be haploid, and naked N-cells (Klaveness, 1972). Since all
   these forms can grow vegetatively, cultures may be of a single
   morphotype, or a mixture. Green et al., (1996) performed flow
   cytometric analysis of fluorochrome-stained DNA in the various cell
   types and confirmed that cultures studied were either C-cells or
   mixtures of C- , N- and apparent S-cells containing half the DNA. It is
   not known what drives transition between the three forms, and fusion of
   S-cells has not been seen.

          Coccoliths are formed internally, one at a time, by an organized
   system of membranes, the coccolith vesicle, derived from the
   endoplasmic reticulum. In E. huxleyi, but not all coccolith-forming
   phytoplankton, a Areticular body @ of uncertain composition appears to
   contact the nascent coccolith and control its formation. The mature
   coccolith is extruded to the cell membrane and externalized; eventually
   it may detach from the cell as additional plates grow beneath it.
   During extrusion, the vesicle membranes fuse with the cell membrane and
   are presumably recycled by transfer as microvesicles to the Golgi
   apparatus. Microvesicles may also be the means by which Ca^2+ is
   conveyed to the coccolith vesicle, so protecting the cytosol form Ca^2+
   concentrations unfavorable to the functioning of intracellular
   energy-transforming and signal-transducing processes.

          Coccolith formation can be arbitrarily divided into three
   stages: i) Ca^2+ uptake (concentration) at the cell surface, ii) Ca^2+
   transport in vesicles, and iii) ordered calcite deposition in the
   coccolith vesicle. Each stage in this highly specialized process will
   require the expression of specific proteins distinct at least in detail
   from those of non-calcifying life-cycle stages of E. huxleyi or
   non-calcifying phytoplankton species. Some of these proteins have been
   partially characterized.

          In the related calcifier Pleurochrysis, Gonzalez et al. (1995)
   reported briefly on a vacuolar-type (V-type) Ca^2+ ATPase activity
   presumed to be associated with the coccolith vesicle. V-type ATPases
   function universally in intracellular membrane traffic. Song and
   Fambrough (1995) probed genomic DNA from this organism with degenerate
   PCR primers designed to recognize P-type ATPase genes, and recovered
   clones with homologies to Ca^2+-transporting ATPases of the mammalian
   and plant Golgi apparatus. P-type ATPases are a superfamily of
   ATP-dependent pumps; the Cd^2+ -resistance system of Gram-positive
   bacteria, for example, is a P-type ATPase which uses ATP to concentrate
   Cd^2+ within membrane vesicles.

   Further information about this organism can be found on the Emiliania
   huxleyi web site.
