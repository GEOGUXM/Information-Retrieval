                        Upcoming Events and Products

   Sept 14, 2001 -- NOAA's Space Environment Center (SEC) is pleased to
   announce that images from the GOES-12 Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) are
   available online at SEC and are archived at the National Geophysical
   Data Center. This SXI is a culmination of more than twenty years of
   effort. NOAA wishes to acknowledge and thank the USAF for funding the
   SXI and NASA Marshall for building this fine instrument as well as its
   in-kind support. SXI was built to provide continuous full-disk x-ray
   images of the Sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona. These images
   will clearly show dark coronal holes that are the source of high-speed
   solar wind streams associated with geomagnetic storms. X-ray images
   will show solar flares and active regions, which extend high into the
   corona. Combined with other optical observations, these x-ray images
   will improve our ability to predict the magnitude of energetic particle
   events on Earth.

   Relativistic Electron Forecast Model
   The impact of high-energy (relativistic) electrons on orbiting
   satellites can cause electric discharges across internal satellite
   components, which in turn leads to spacecaft upsets and/or complete
   satellite failures. The Relativistic Electron Forecast Model predicts
   the occurrence of these electrons in geo-synchronous orbit.

   New Ionospheric Data, Displays and Models
   Data from the USAF DISS array of ionospheric ground stations began
   arriving at SEC in February 2000. New 2-day and monthly data lists of
   ionospheric parameters are online for review and comment until June
   2000 when the final format will be implemented. Ionospheric data models
   are being developed, as well as near-real-time ionospheric parameters
   web pages. These new ionospheric products are scheduled for completion
   in mid-2001.

   Space Weather Advisory Products
   Two Space Weather Advisory Products that use the NOAA Scales notation
   to classify space weather conditions are currently issued by SEC --
   Space Weather Bulletins and Weekly Outlooks. Space Weather Advisory
   Alerts and Warnings are being developed.

   Wang-Sheeley Model
   The Wang-Sheely Model predicts the background solar wind speed and the
   interplanetary magnetic field polarity at Earth, two important
   parameters required for predicting geomagnetic activity (e.g., Ap).
   Displays include Surface Magnetograms, Derived Coronal Hole maps,
   Source Surface Field maps, and Solar Wind Speed maps using data from
   three solar observatories. Plus daily predictions of 1- to 7-day
   advanced solar wind speed and (radial) IMF polarity at Earth.

   IMAGE Satellite images
   NASAs Imager for Magntopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE)
   satellite was successfully launched on March 25. IMAGE is the first
   mission dedicated to seeing Earths space environment and watching solar
   activity drive space weather. Through a partnership between NASA, NOAA,
   and the Communications Research Laboratory (Japan), the IMAGE satellite
   will broadcast its images of space weather in real time, and ground
   stations will receive the images and transfer them to the NOAA Space
   Environment Center. IMAGE will obtain data on the high-latitude
   northern hemisphere ionosphere and magnetosphere, as well as the
   magnetospheric equatorial plane for roughly 20 hours/day. In addition
   to the images, possible data products include the location, strength,
   and motion of high-latitude ionospheric disturbances, global maps of
   energetic particle disturbances, and the plasmapause and magnetopause
   boundary locations and motions. It is anticipated that these data
   products will have operational value, both as immediate indicators of
   ionospheric/magnetospheric disturbances and also as input and
   validation data for space environment models. NASAs Goddard Space
   Flight Center, the IMAGE instrument teams, and NOAAs Space Environment
   Center have collaborated to make near-real-time images available on
   SEC's Web site.
