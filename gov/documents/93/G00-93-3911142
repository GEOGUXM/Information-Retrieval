                              Privacy Statement

                            Access Board Website

   Thank you for visiting the Access Board's website and reviewing our
   privacy policy.  Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect no
   personal information about you when you visit our website unless you
   choose to provide that information to us.  Here is how we handle
   information about your visit to our website:

    Information Collected and Stored Automatically

   You do not have to give us personal information to visit our site.  If
   you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read
   pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
   information about your visit automatically. This information does not
   identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the
   following information about your visit:
     * the Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a
       private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect
       from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a
       number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
       are surfing the Web) from which you access our website;
     * the type of browser (including brand and version) and operating
       system used to access our site;
     * the date and time you accessed our site and the amount of time
       spent on our site;
     * the pages you visited; and
     * if you linked to our website from another website or through a
       search engine, the address of that website or the name of search
       engine.

   We use this information to make our site more useful to visitors and
   to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of
   technology our visitors use.  We do not track or record information
   about individuals and their visits.

    If You Send Us Personal Information

   Our website permits you to send us information through several on-line
   forms.  These forms allow you to:
     * sign up to receive our free newsletter by mail or by e-mail (see
       form);
     * sign up to receive news updates sent out by e-mail (see form); or
     * file a complaint under the Architectural Barriers Act (see form).

   Forms for subscribing to our mailed newsletter request the necessary
   mailing information.  This information is entered into an Access Board
   database used only for the distribution of Board publications.  Forms
   to receive our newsletter by e-mail or e-mail news updates request an
   e-mail address.  This information is added to e-mail distribution lists
   maintained by the Board and used only for these purposes.  We do not
   request or store any information other than the mailing or e-mailing
   information requested in our forms.  The Board does not collect
   information for commercial marketing.

   The Access Board is responsible for enforcing the Architectural
   Barriers Act (ABA), which requires access to  facilities designed,
   built, altered, or leased with Federal funds.  The Board enforces this
   law through the investigation of complaints filed by the public about
   the lack of access to a facility.  Our enforcement regulations prohibit
   us from disclosing the identity of complainants without their written
   permission.  We do not create individual profiles with the information
   you provide or give it to any private organizations.

   The only other means of submitting information to us is by sending us
   an e-mail message.  A posted e-mail directory lists the various Access
   Board mailboxes noted on our website.  If you choose to provide us with
   personal information in an e-mail message, we will use such information
   only to respond to your message and to get you the information you have
   requested.  However, comments which are e-mailed to the Board in
   response to notices of proposed rulemaking are placed in a docket for
   public inspection at the Board’s office and may be posted on the
   Board’s website as well.

    Links to Other Sites

   Our website has links to many other Federal agencies and non-commercial
   sites.  Once you link to another site, you are subject to the privacy
   policy of the other site.  See our directory of links to other sites.

   contact our webmaster (e-mail) or call (202) 272-5434 (voice) or (202)
   272-5449 (TTY).
