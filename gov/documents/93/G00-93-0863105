   be filed using proportionally-spaced type of at least 12-point, with
   margins of at least one inch on all sides. Footnotes may not be used
   for the presentation of any statements of fact or arguments. The
   prescribed page limits are the MAXIMUM allowed, and the parties are
   discouraged from writing to the maximum if a more succinct offering
   would do. The court does not assume that length necessarily equates
   with quality. Amici Curiae. Briefs for amici curiae must be filed on
   the same date as the brief the amicus supports. Amici supporting the
   same side are strongly encouraged to file a joint brief. See D.C. Cir.
   Rule 29(d). All notices of intent to participate or motions for leave
   to participate as amicus curiae must be filed within 14 days of the
   date of this order. Filing Format. All briefs, and the deferred
   appendix, must be filed in the following formats: Ç Hard copy -- 19
   copies of each submission must be filed. Ç PDF -- the parties will be
   notified of any changes in the procedures established in the court's
   order filed September 26, 2000. Ç CD-Rom -- the parties and amici must
   file their initial and final briefs in CD-Rom format. Each brief must
   include hyperlinks to every case, statute, or other document cited in
   the brief, including those record documents to be included in the joint
   appendix. The parties are encouraged to cooperate so that CD-Rom
   versions of responsive and reply briefs incorporate briefs filed
   previously. The joint appendix will consist of all record documents
   cited by any party, presented in the order in which they are first
   cited. For this purpose, documents first cited by the United States in
   its brief will precede documents first cited in the joint brief of the
   state appellees. The parties are encouraged to cooperate in the
   production of a single joint CD-Rom version of the final briefs and
   appendix. Argument. Oral argument in these cases will be held on
   February 26 and 27, 2001. The court will issue an order or orders at a
   later date establishing the time and format of argument, the order in
   which the issues will be presented, and any special arrangements for
   public and press attendance. Per Curiam FOR THE COURT: Mark J. Langer,
   Clerk
