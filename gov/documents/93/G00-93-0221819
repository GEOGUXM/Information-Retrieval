   Qwhiz is NASA's premiere real-time, multi-player Web game featuring
   NASA electronic resources. Match wits with students around the country
   in an online competition or beat the clock on the single player
   gameboard.

   SIMON is a software tool designed to access and manage Internet
   information for K-12 teachers and students. It maximizes a local area
   network, retrieves Internet information, and organizes lessons in a
   library.

   ILIAD is an offline search engine that searches the Internet via email
   or the Web. Using agent technology, ILIAD provides intelligent,
   selective access to Internet information through two avenues; a simple
   low-cost email interface, and a Web-based form.

   Space Team Online focuses on the men and women who make the Space
   Shuttle fly to learn about their diverse and exciting careers. We peek
   behind the scenes as these folks train astronauts, prepare the Shuttle
   between missions, launch the Shuttle, successfuly execute missions from
   the Control Center and safely land the Shuttle.
