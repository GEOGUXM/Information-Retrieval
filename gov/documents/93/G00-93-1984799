                           Trade Capacity Building


   The United States is a world leader in helping developing countries
   benefit from trade liberalization and a growing volume of global trade
   opportunities. The Presidents 2001 International Trade Agenda
   emphasizes the priority to help developing countries and emerging
   markets begin the process of integrating themselves into the world
   trading system. Trade capacity building activities implemented by a
   broad range of U.S. Government agencies assist developing and
   transition countries to participate in and benefit from expanding
   global trade.
