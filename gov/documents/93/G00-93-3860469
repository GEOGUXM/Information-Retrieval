   NHTSA Publishes Proposed Model Year 2004 CAFE Standard

   The U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety
   Administration (NHTSA) today issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for
   Model Year 2004 light truck Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
   standards.

   Beginning in 1996, Congress has prohibited NHTSA from spending any
   funds to consider any changes to the level of 1996 CAFE standards. This
   prohibition was lifted in December 2001.

   NHTSA has therefore not had sufficient time to study whether a level
   other than the one that has been in place since 1996 should be
   proposed. By law, NHTSA must issue a final rule establishing a Model
   Year 2004 model year light truck CAFE standard by April 1, 2002.
   Therefore, NHTSA is proposing a MY 2004 light truck CAFE standard of
   20.7 mpg, the same level that has been in effect since 1996.

   The agency is inviting comments, however, on the maximum feasible level
   of average fuel economy and will consider all comments, including
   comments with data and analysis suggesting a level higher or lower than
   20.7 mpg.

   The notice will have a 30-day comment period. Procedures for commenting
   are included in the notice. The notice of proposed rulemaking is
   available to the public in the DOT Docket (Docket Number NHTSA 11048).
   The rule also is posted on the Internet and can be viewed after
   searching at http://dms.dot.gov/. Comments may be submitted
   electronically at this site. The notice also may be downloaded from
   NHTSA's website at www.nhtsa.dot.gov
