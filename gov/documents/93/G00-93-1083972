   Safe Travel

   Weekly Column from U.S. Congressman Eric Cantor (R-Virginia)
   WASHINGTON, Nov. 2â€” The terrorist attacks on September 11,
   2001, made it apparent that the airline security system in our
   country is broken. Congress has a plan to fix it.
   September's attacks significantly altered the way Americans feel
   about traveling by airplane. The terrorist activities of that day
   have frightened many into staying away from the skies that used
   to be widely considered safe and secure.
   Last Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives, with my
   support, passed a comprehensive plan to improve aviation safety
   and security so the American people can get on with their lives,
   even during America's war on terrorism.
   The legislation rests upon four major principles -- safety,
   accountability, quality, and flexibility. This will ensure that
   citizens across the country and the Commonwealth can feel safe
   when they fly.
   The airport security measure improves safety by creating federal
   standards and enforcement for security personnel in airports.
   There will now be tough, new standards for the employees at
   airports who check our baggage before we board an airplane.
   Accountability is an essential component of the bill and is
   ensured by a zero-tolerance policy for airport security personnel.
   There will be no tolerance if the new airline security system
   breaks down. If safety officials are not doing their job and
   security for air passengers slackens, there will be consequences.
   Quality personnel will be guaranteed through the performance of
   background checks on individuals seeking positions as airport
   security personnel.
   The plan also fulfills President Bush's request to provide him with
   maximum flexibility to make the decisions regarding the plan's
   details that he feels best strengthen security.
   When the American people travel in the air, they deserve to feel
   as safe as anyone else in the country. The House airport
   security measure, otherwise known as the Secure Transportation
   for America Act, ensures equal, safe and secure treatment for
   every American who flies.
   Specific initiatives in the measure include: federal air marshals
   required on every domestic and intercontinental flight; the
   presence of law enforcement at every security checkpoint within
   airports; strengthened cockpit doors; authorization of $500
   million for cockpit and aircraft security; and greater protection
   for pilots.
   Additionally, upon implementation of the airport bill, President
   Bush will have a new Airport Security Czar who can provide
   leadership on ensuring security for all modes of transportation.
   I am also pleased that the House bill addresses the issue of
   foreign nationals, preventing individuals like the terrorists who
   attacked the Pentagon and New York's World Trade Center while
   visiting our country, from being hired as baggage screeners.
   These new rigorous safety measures help to ensure that airport
   security and baggage and passenger screening meet the highest
   levels of expectation.
   When someone flies aboard an airplane from the United States,
   they should be able to assume terrorists are not on board with
   dangerous weapons. Sadly, even after the terrorist attacks of
   September 11th, the screening process at our country's airports
   has been sub-standard.
   The measure passed by the House ensures these measures will
   be effective as soon as possible after Bush signs the measure.
   Making America's airlines safe for our citizens as quickly as
   possible is a priority. Securing our airports and restoring
   confidence in flying as a safe mode of transportation will help to
   restore our airline industry and stimulate our economy.
   Airlines and tourism are important components of the
   Commonwealth's economy, and I am glad that Congress is
   helping to sustain this industry.
   I am pleased to report that Congress is delivering a package that
   will make Americans feel safe and secure as they fly.
