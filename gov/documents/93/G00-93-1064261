     __________________________________________________________________

INTRODUCTION

   Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was found in shallow ground-water
   samples in a study of 8 urban and 20 agricultural areas throughout the
   United States in 1993 and 1994 (Squillace and others, 1995, p. 1). The
   compound is added to gasoline either seasonally or year round in many
   parts of the United States to increase the octane level and to reduce
   carbon monoxide and ozone levels in the air.

   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Quality Laboratory
   (NWQL), near Denver, uses state-of-the-art technology to analyze
   samples for MTBE as part of the USGS water-quality studies. In
   addition, the NWQL offers custom analyses to determine two other fuel
   oxygenates--ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) and tert-amyl methyl ether
   (TAME). The NWQL was not able to obtain a reference standard for
   tert-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE), another possible fuel oxygenate (Shelley
   and Fouhy, 1994, p. 63).

   The shallow ground-water samples were collected as part of the USGS
   National Water-Quality Assessment Program. These samples were collected
   from 211 urban wells or springs and 562 agricultural wells sampled by
   the USGS in 1993 and 1994. The wells were keyed to specific land-use
   areas to assess the effects of different uses on ground-water quality
   (Squillace and others, 1995, p. 2). Ground-water samples were preserved
   on site to pH less than or equal to 2 with a solution of 1:1
   hydrochloric acid. All samples were analyzed at the NWQL within 2 weeks
   after collection.

   The purpose of this fact sheet is to explain briefly the analytical
   method implemented by the USGS for determining MTBE and other fuel
   oxygenates. The scope is necessarily limited to an overview of the
   analytical method (instrumentation, sample preparation, calibration and
   quantitation, identification, and preservation of samples) and method
   performance (reagent blanks, accuracy, and precision).

APPLICATION

   The USGS laboratory method is suitable for determining MTBE and other
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in whole water. The method detection
   limit for MTBE concentrations is 0.06 microgram per liter (µg/L), and
   the method reporting limit is 0.20 µg/L. The linear calibration of MTBE
   concentrations for undiluted water samples ranges from 0.05 to 20 µg/L.
   Water samples containing concentrations greater than 20 µg/L are
   diluted.

SUMMARY OF METHOD

   The method uses purge and trap gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
   (GC/MS) to identify the fuel oxygenates. The VOCs are purged from water
   samples by bubbling helium through a 25-milliliter (mL) aqueous sample
   (Rose and Schroeder, 1995, p. 4). MTBE and other compounds are trapped
   in a tube containing suitable sorbent materials and then thermally
   desorbed onto a 0.53-millimeter (mm) inside diameter capillary column.
   A gas chromatograph is temperature programmed to separate the VOCs,
   which are detected by a mass spectrometer. Identification of MTBE is
   confirmed by analyzing reference material under the same conditions as
   the samples and comparing retention times and mass spectra with
   reference material from the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology.

   Purge and trap analyses using a mass-spectrometer detector provide a
   reliable identification of MTBE, because the GC retention time and mass
   spectra are unique for the compound. Further confirmation of the
   presence of this compound is not required. MTBE was not detected in any
   laboratory reagent blanks (analyzed May-November 1993 and March
   1994-June 1995); the accuracy and precision of MTBE analyses were
   within accepted limits of 80 to 120 percent with a relative standard
   deviation of less than 20 percent (U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency, 1992, p. 20).

ANALYTICAL METHOD

  Instrumentation

   The NWQL method for determining MTBE concentration is comparable to the
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency method 524.2 (U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency, 1992). Water samples are analyzed using the
   following instruments:

   o Hewlett-Packard Models 5971 and 5972 Gas Chromatograph/Mass
   Spectrometer (GC/MS) equipped with a Channeltron 5778 electron
   multiplier, 75-meter (m) by 0.53-mm inside diameter capillary column
   (DB-624), with 3-micrometer (µm) film thickness;

   o Tekmar Aquatek Autosampler; and

   o Carbopack B/Carboxin 1000 and 1001 sorbents used in purge and trap
   concentrator (Supelco, VOCARB 3000).

  Sample Preparation

   A 25-mL aliquot of water is automatically introduced to the purge
   vessel via the Autosampler transfer line. The sample then is purged
   with helium for 11 minutes at a flow rate of 40 milliliters per minute
   (mL/min). Compounds purged by helium are collected on the VOCARB 3000
   solid sorbent trap. The temperature of the gas chromatograph is lowered
   to -20°C prior to the desorption step. Desorb temperature is 250°C for
   1 minute, followed by a bake cycle at 260°C for 10 minutes.

  Calibration and Quantitation

   Five to nine calibration standard solutions containing MTBE and other
   selected compounds are prepared in reagent water to produce
   concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 20 µg/L. Analysis of these standard
   solutions is used to establish calibration curves with THRU-PUT
   Systems, Inc., Target software. Two internal standards are used for
   calibration: fluorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene-d[4]. The amount of
   each compound is quantitated using the most abundant ion (table 1).

  Identification

   For a water sample, MTBE is identified by comparing the mass ion
   profiles and the GC retention time (fig. 1) to the retention time and
   mass ion profiles of the MTBE standard (not shown). The GC retention
   time of the sample should be within 0.1 minute of the reference
   standard. The identity is verified by comparing the sample's mass
   spectrum (fig. 2A) with the MTBE reference mass spectrum (fig. 2B). To
   confirm identification, the sample spectrum is normalized to the
   abundance of the quantitation ion in the MTBE reference and substracted
   from the MTBE reference sample. The difference spectrum should be
   within 30 percent of the MTBE reference (fig. 2C). Chromatographic
   retention time for VOCs is listed in table 1.

  Preservation

   Samples of VOCs are preserved by adjusting to pH 2 or less with 1:1
   hydrochloric acid and then chilling to 4°C. The maximum holding time is
   14 days. Replicate reagent-water spikes (2.0 µg/L), adjusted to pH 2,
   were prepared and analyzed on days 1, 7, and 14. Recovery for MTBE was
   97 percent after 14 days with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of
   2.5 percent; for ETBE, 100 percent after 14 days, RSD 1.8 percent; and
   for TAME, 97 percent after 14 days, RSD 2.1 percent. Recovery and
   precision results for the preservation study are listed in table 2. For
   comparison, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency methods for VOCs in
   drinking water (Method 524) specify that mean accuracy should be 80 to
   120 percent and the RSD less than 20 percent (U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency, 1992).

METHOD PERFORMANCE

  Laboratory Reagent Blanks

   Laboratory reagent blanks are routinely analyzed with each set of water
   samples using blank water prepared at the NWQL. Reagent blank water is
   prepared by boiling deionized water for 1 hour, cooling, and purging
   with high-quality nitrogen gas until ready for use. MTBE was not
   detected in any of these laboratory reagent blanks.

  Accuracy and Precision

   Reagent water spiked with VOCs is routinely analyzed with each set of
   samples to measure accuracy and precision. Accuracy and precision of
   MTBE analyses were evaluated by analyzing spiked replicates of reagent
   water and ground water at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 5 µg/L.
   The spiked replicates represent data collected from short-term (1 day)
   to long-term (1 year) time periods for MTBE, ETBE, and TAME (table 3).
   The data also represent measurements from three instruments by three
   analysts. Long-term data are not yet available for ETBE and TAME, which
   are being evaluated for addition to the method.

   Long-term performance of this analytical method was verified by the
   analysis of MTBE in 77 reagent-water spikes at 5.0 µg/L throughout a
   6-month period, with a mean recovery of 98 percent and a relative
   standard deviation of 8 percent (fig. 3). This result is well within
   quality-control criteria for comparable U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency methods that relative standard deviations should be less than 20
   percent (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1992). Analysis of 80
   low-level standard solutions at 0.1 and 0.2 µg/L MTBE throughout 12
   months shows average recoveries of 97 to 98 percent with a relative
   standard deviation of 11 to 13 percent. Some of the reagent-water
   spikes were adjusted to pH less than or equal to 2; however, most were
   analyzed at about pH 7. Box plots of the MTBE concentration in reagent
   water spiked at low concentrations are shown in figure 4. (Method
   performance is within quality-control criteria even at these low
   concentrations.)
