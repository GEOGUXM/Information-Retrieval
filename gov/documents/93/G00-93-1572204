                             HECETA BANK PROJECT


           Scientists W. Waldo Wakefield, NOAA NMFS, Northwest Fisheries
   Science Center; Robert W. Embley, NOAA PMEL, Ocean Environment Research
   Division; Brian N. Tissot, Environmental Science & Regional Planning,
   Washington State University, Vancouver; and Mary M. Yoklavich, NOAA,
   National Marine Fisheries Service, Southwest Fisheries Science Center,
   are the principal investigators of a  NOAA National Undersea Research
   Program study of Hecata Bank, a 50 km-long rocky shoal on the outer
   shelf of central Oregon, and a major fishing ground.

           The project combines historical data, high resolution seafloor
   imagery, and new survey and analysis techniques to provide fishery
   scientists with a model approach for characterizing and quantifying
   habitat associations of benthic animals on a scale meaningful to the
   stock assessment of commercial species and conservation of benthic
   communities. State-of-the-art survey strategies, instrumentation, and
   data analysis techniques will be used to:
     * Determine quantifiable relationships between groundfish population
       and seafloor morphology/texture and the controlling factors these
       such relationships.
     * Changes that have occurred in the fish and megafaunal invertebrate
       populations after a decade of intense commercial trawl fishing.
     * Characteristics, and the extent of natural refugia in the site.

                      research project on Hecata Bank.
