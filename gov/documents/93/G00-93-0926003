   Overview

   Theme: Buffers: Common-sense conservation

   Purpose: To encourage the use of conservation buffers by agricultural
   producers and other landowners--in both rural and urban settings.

   Goal: To install 2 million miles (up to 7 million acres) of
   conservation buffers by the year 2002.

   In April 1997, USDA officially launched the new National Conservation
   Buffer Initiative and pledged to help landowners install 2 million
   miles of conservation buffers by the year 2002. Agricultural producers
   and other landowners who install buffers can improve soil, air, and
   water quality; enhance wildlife habitat; restore biodiversity; and
   create scenic landscapes.

   The initiative is led by the Natural Resources Conservation Service
   (NRCS) in cooperation with the Agricultural Research Service, Farm
   Service Agency; Forest Service; Cooperative State Research, Education,
   and Extension Service; state conservation agencies; conservation
   districts; and numerous other public and private partners. To help
   implement the initiative, NRCS designated (1) an agricultural
   coordinator to work with the National Corn Growers Association in St.
   Louis to promote buffers among corn growers and other agricultural
   groups, and (2) a liaison with the National Pork Producers Council to
   work, in part, to promote the acceptance of conservation buffers as a
   means of aiding livestock manure management efforts.

   The National Conservation Buffer Initiative encourages farmers and
   ranchers to understand the economic and environmental benefits of
   buffer strips and use these practices through the various programs in
   the conservation tool kit. Programs used for this effort include the
   continuous Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) sign-up, as well as the
   Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Wildlife Habitat
   Incentives Program (WHIP), Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), Stewardship
   Incentives Program (SIP), and Emergency Watershed Protection Program
   (EWP).

   The Buffer Partnership

   Seven private sector firms, organized as the National Conservation
   Buffer Council, have pledged more than $1 million over three years to
   complement USDA's efforts to promote the acceptance of conservation
   buffers among producers. The seven are Cargill, ConAgra, Farmland
   Industries, Monsanto, Novartis Crop Protection, Pioneer Hi-Bred
   International, and Terra Industries.

   Conservation buffers not only represent profitable, common-sense
   conservation for individual landowners, but the use of buffers has also
   drawn the endorsement of many major agricultural companies and leading
   agricultural and conservation organizations. Because these groups know
   the importance of sound conservation practices, for individual
   landowners and the entire economy, they have pledged their
   organizational support by joining USDA's National Conservation Buffer
   Team. To date, the team includes nine federal agencies, the National
   Conservation Buffer Council, and more than 75 nonprofit agricultural
   and environmental organizations.

   Conservation Buffers

   Conservation buffers are small areas or strips of land in permanent
   vegetation, designed to intercept pollutants and manage other
   environmental concerns. Buffers include: riparian buffers, filter
   strips, grassed waterways, shelterbelts, windbreaks, living snow
   fences, contour grass strips, cross-wind trap strips, shallow water
   areas for wildlife, field borders, alley cropping, herbaceous wind
   barriers, and vegetative barriers.

   Strategically placed buffer strips in the agricultural landscape can
   effectively mitigate the movement of sediment, nutrients, and
   pesticides within farm fields and from farm fields. When coupled with
   appropriate upland treatments, including crop residue management,
   nutrient management, integrated pest management, winter cover crops,
   and similar management practices and technologies, buffer strips should
   allow farmers to achieve a measure of economic and environmental
   sustainability in their operations. Buffer strips can also enhance
   wildlife habitat and protect biodiversity.

   Benefits of Buffers

   Conservation buffers slow water runoff, trap sediment, and enhance
   infiltration within the buffer. Buffers also trap fertilizers,
   pesticides, pathogens, and heavy metals, and they help trap snow and
   cut down on blowing soil in areas with strong winds. In addition, they
   protect livestock and wildlife from harsh weather and buildings from
   wind damage. If properly installed and maintained, they have the
   capacity to:
     * remove up to 50 percent or more of nutrients and pesticides.
     * remove up to 60 percent or more of certain pathogens.
     * remove up to 75 percent or more of sediment.

   Conservation buffers reduce noise and odor. They are a source of food,
   nesting cover, and shelter for many wildlife species. Buffers also
   provide connecting corridors that enable wildlife to move safely from
   one habitat area to another.

   Conservation buffers help stabilize a stream and reduce its water
   temperature. Buffers also offer a setback distance for agricultural
   chemical use from water sources.

   Like the trim on a house makes the house look better, well-planned
   conservation buffers improve the appearance of a farm or ranch. If used
   as part of a comprehensive conservation system, buffers will make good
   use of areas that often should not be cropped.

   Key Messages

   1. Conservation buffers work environmentally because they:
     * Control soil erosion by both wind and water.
     * Improve soil quality.
     * Improve water quality by removing sediment, fertilizers,
       pesticides, pathogens, and other potential contaminants from
       runoff.
     * Enhance fish and wildlife habitat.
     * Reduce flooding.
     * Conserve energy.
     * Protect buildings, roads, and livestock.
     * Conserve biodiversity.

   2. Conservation buffers work economically because of financial
   incentives available through USDA conservation programs--the continuous
   Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) sign-up, Environmental Quality
   Incentives Program (EQIP), Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP),
   general CRP, Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), and Stewardship Incentives
   Program (SIP).

   3. Financial incentives available through the continuous CRP sign-up
   are especially attractive:
     * A signing incentive payment of $100 to $150 per acre for riparian
       buffers, filter strips, grassed waterways, shelterbelts, field
       windbreaks, and living snow fences.
     * Up to 50 percent cost sharing for practice installation.
     * A practice incentive payment equal to 40 percent of eligible
       practice installation costs.
     * A 20 percent rental rate incentive for riparian buffers, filter
       strips, grassed waterways, and field windbreaks.
     * A 10 percent rental rate incentive for wellhead protection areas.
     * Higher annual maintenance payments per acre for certain activities.
     * Updated rental rates nationwide for installing riparian buffers on
       marginal grazing land.

   4. No competitive offer is required in the continuous CRP sign-up, and
   there is no waiting period. Offers are accepted automatically if
   eligibility requirements are met, the land offered for enrollment is
   suitable for the buffers you want to install, and you are willing to
   accept the going rental rate, plus any incentives that might be
   offered.

   5. Conservation buffers may help you meet Federal, state, or local
   pollution control requirements.

   6. Many state and local governments--and even some private
   organizations--offer additional financial incentives to install
   conservation buffers.

   7. Conservation buffers are a visual demonstration of your commitment
   to land stewardship.
