                         BROOKHAVEN LAB OPENS CENTER

                     FOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES


   UPTON, NY - As concerns about global nuclear proliferation and
   terrorism escalate, the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National
   Laboratory has opened a new center where scientists will work together
   to solve technical problems related to international security issues.

   Called the Center for International Security Studies, the new effort
   will be funded by private foundations and housed in BNL's Department of
   Advanced Technology.

   The center builds upon BNL's existing strengths in the technical
   aspects of international security, especially nuclear nonproliferation.
   DOE currently funds $25 million in nonproliferation and national
   security research at BNL.

   For example, Brookhaven scientists are currently working with former
   Soviet states to safeguard nuclear materials using special devices and
   techniques developed at BNL.

   The center's director, Dr. Mark Sakitt, has already begun planning a
   workshop for college teachers on nuclear nonproliferation. It will be
   held at BNL and funded by the National Science Foundation.

   Also planned are summer institutes for students planning to enter the
   security field, an internship program for academic researchers already
   involved in the field, and a visitors program to bring experts to BNL.

   "Through this new center, we hope to encourage a new generation of
   technically trained people to enter this exciting field, to enhance the
   understanding and teaching of this subject in academia, and to enrich
   our existing staff and programs through interactions with people of
   diverse backgrounds," said BNL Director Dr. John Marburger.

   BNL's technically oriented international security center will
   complement policy-oriented ones at other institutions, notably Stanford
   University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Collaborations among researchers at all three are expected.

   A list of the center's advisory board members follows.
