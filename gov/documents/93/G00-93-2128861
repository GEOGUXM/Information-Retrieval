                                 BOOK MY FAVORITES

   We now offer a convenient service for our devoted readers. If you have
   an in-district borrowers card or pay a yearly fee and you love to read
   new, popular fiction, this may be just the program  for you. You may
   choose up to 15 names from a list of best selling authors. If one of
   your authors has a new hardcover title released, we'll reserve it for
   you automatically. You won't have to remember to come in or call. When
   the book is available, we'll begin filling reserves for the "book club"
   members first, starting at different parts of the alphabet each time.

   Fill in one of the sign-up forms the next time you're at the Central
   Library, branches or bookmobile. This service is also available to our
   Via Mail patrons.

   You fill in the form, we'll do the rest. Join BOOK MY FAVORITES soon.
