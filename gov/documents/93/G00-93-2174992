                          FAMILY-FRIENDLY LEAVE POLICIES FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES

   Do you need time off from work for personal, family, or medical needs?

   Are you confused about your options?

   The following may help to put things into perspective. See your
   agency's personnel office for additional information on each of these
   leave policies.

   ANNUAL LEAVE

   Annual leave is designed to give you vacation periods for rest and
   relaxation and to provide time off for your personal business or family
   needs. Your annual leave must be scheduled and approved in advance.

   SICK LEAVE

   Sick leave may be used when you--
     * Receive medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment;
     * Are incapacitated by physical or mental illness, injury, pregnancy,
       or childbirth;
     * Would, because of exposure to a communicable disease, jeopardize
       the health of others by your presence on the job; or
     * Must be absent from work for adoption-related activities.

   In addition, you may use a limited amount* of sick leave to--
     * Provide care for a family member as the result of physical or
       mental illness, injury, pregnancy, childbirth, or medical, dental,
       or optical examination or treatment; or
     * Make arrangements necessitated by the death of a family member or
       attend the funeral of a family member.

   * If you are a full-time employee, you may use up to 40 hours (5 days)
   of your sick leave each leave year for family care and bereavement
   purposes. An additional 64 hours (8 days) may be used as long as you
   maintain a balance of at least 80 hours of sick leave in your sick
   leave account.

   Part-time employees and employees with uncommon tours of duty are also
   covered, and the amount of sick leave they may use for these purposes
   is pro-rated.

   FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE

   Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), covered
   employees are entitled to a total of 12 administrative workweeks of
   unpaid leave (leave without pay) during any 12-month period for--
     * The birth of a son or daughter and care of the newborn;
     * The placement of a son or daughter with you for adoption or foster
       care;
     * The care of your spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious
       health condition; and
     * Your own serious health condition that makes you unable to perform
       the duties of your position.

   Upon return from FMLA leave, you must be returned to the same or
   equivalent position. While on FMLA leave, you are entitled to maintain
   health benefits coverage. If you are on leave without pay under the
   FMLA, you are responsible for paying the employee share of the health
   benefits premium.

   You may choose to substitute annual leave for unpaid leave under the
   FMLA. You may also substitute sick leave in those situations in which
   the use of sick leave is permitted.

   LEAVE FOR BONE-MARROW OR ORGAN DONATION

   As a Federal employee, you are entitled to use 7 days of paid leave
   each calendar year (in addition to annual or sick leave) to serve as a
   bone-marrow or organ donor.

   LEAVE SHARING

   If you have a medical emergency and have exhausted your own leave, the
   leave transfer program allows other Federal employees to donate annual
   leave to you.

   There may also be a leave bank program where you work. These bank
   programs allow members (those who contribute a specific amount) to
   apply for leave from the leave bank in the event of a medical
   emergency.

   Federal leave policies can work together to help you manage your work
   and family responsibilities. Here are some examples of how employees
   may use leave when facing a personal, medical, or family emergency.
     * Laura is a single mother with two children who has worked for the
       Government for 2 1/2 years. Laura has 201 hours of sick leave and
       80 hours of annual leave. Laura's children have problems with
       recurring ear infections and strep throat and must occasionally be
       kept home from school and afternoon day care. Laura may use up to
       13 days of sick leave a year to care for her children when they are
       ill (as long as her sick leave balance does not drop below 80
       hours). By doing so, Laura may be able to conserve her annual leave
       for a possible family vacation or to care for her children when her
       child care provider is unavailable.
     * Michael has worked for the Federal Government for only 5 months. He
       had 40 hours of sick leave and 36 hours of annual leave before he
       underwent an emergency appendectomy last week. He has been absent
       for 5 days, and his doctor wants him to use at least 6 weeks to
       recuperate. Fortunately, Michael is a member of his agency's leave
       bank program. He may apply to the bank for donated leave to help
       support him until he can return to work. Other employees may also
       wish to donate leave to Michael through the leave transfer program.
       He may also request advanced sick and/or annual leave if the
       donated leave is not sufficient.
     * Carol is expecting a baby in 4 months. Carol has 260 hours of sick
       leave and 200 hours of annual leave. She wants to spend as much
       time as possible with her new baby. Carol's doctor anticipates that
       she will need 6 weeks to recuperate after the baby's birth. Carol
       has requested 240 hours of sick leave. She has also requested 4
       weeks of annual leave and 3 months of leave without pay (LWOP). Her
       supervisor approves the sick and annual leave and informs her of
       her entitlement to unpaid leave under the FMLA. Carol decides to
       invoke her FMLA entitlement and use 4 weeks of leave without pay
       under the FMLA following her approved annual leave. In addition,
       she and her supervisor work out a leave schedule that permits Carol
       to use FMLA leave without pay on an intermittent basis 2 days a
       week for 3 months following her return to work.
     * Jeff and his wife plan to travel abroad soon to adopt a child. He
       has a sick leave balance of 280 hours and an annual leave balance
       of 160 hours. Jeff may use sick leave for absences related to the
       adoption, including travel time. His agency may advance him up to
       30 days of sick leave if requested. Jeff may also request annual
       leave to spend time with his new son or daughter after the
       adoption. In addition, he may invoke his entitlement to leave
       without pay under the FMLA.
     * Tom fell off his roof while cleaning the gutters and broke his hip.
       The doctor says Tom will need to be absent from work for at least
       16 weeks. Tom has 240 hours of sick leave and 137 hours of annual
       leave. His installation is understaffed, and Tom is worried that
       when his sick leave is gone, his supervisor will refuse to grant
       him annual leave. He is most concerned about the possibility of
       losing his job and with it his medical benefits. Tom may use his
       sick leave and then invoke his entitlement to unpaid leave under
       the FMLA. He may then substitute his annual leave for part of the
       FMLA leave without pay. While he is on FMLA leave, his reemployment
       rights and medical benefits are protected. In addition, Tom may
       apply for and use donated leave from his agency's leave transfer
       program.
     * Ruth and her husband have both worked for the Government for 10
       years. Their daughter was recently diagnosed with a terminal
       illness. Ruth and her husband want to care for their daughter at
       home for as long as possible. They have sufficient sick leave in
       their accounts for each to use 13 days to care for their daughter.
       Ruth has also requested 160 hours of annual leave. Ruth's
       supervisor was sympathetic, but based on work-related needs, he
       felt he could approve only 80 hours of annual leave. Ruth notified
       her supervisor of her intent to invoke her entitlement to leave
       without pay under the FMLA. Ruth used her 80 hours of approved
       annual leave and then substituted her remaining annual leave for
       FMLA leave without pay. Her husband may also invoke his entitlement
       to leave under the FMLA. When their annual leave is exhausted, Ruth
       and her husband may each apply for and receive donated leave from
       their agencies' leave transfer programs. In this way, they will be
       able to care for their daughter at home until hospitalization is
       necessary.
     * Emilio's sister needs a kidney transplant, and Emilio has decided
       to donate his kidney to her. Emilio may use 7 days of paid leave to
       be a bone marrow or organ donor. This includes the time required
       for testing to see if he is a compatible donor, plus the time
       required to undergo the transplant procedure and recuperate. Emilio
       may get additional time off from work by requesting annual and/or
       sick leave, advanced leave, and donated leave through his agency's
       leave transfer program (if he exhausts his own available paid
       leave).
