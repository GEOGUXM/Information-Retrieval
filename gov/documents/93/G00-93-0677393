   Space Shuttle

Marshall's Shuttle Power

   NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center is responsible for the most critical
   components for Americas workhorse Space Shuttle. The Marshall Center
   provides the propulsion system for every flight of the Shuttle.

   The Space Shuttle main propulsion system three major elements:
     * two solid rocket boosters that combine to produce 5.3 million
       pounds of thrust for the boost from the launch pad for the first
       two minutes
     * three main engines that generate a total thrust of more than one
       million pounds and provide power for the eight-and-one-half minutes
       of launch
     * the external fuel tank that holds over one-half million gallons of
       liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen that fuel the main engines

   Today planning for the future Marshall engineers are designing and
   developing enhancements and upgrades to the Shuttle to improve safety
   and increase performance and reliability.

   As NASAs center of excellence for space propulsion, Marshall employs
   some of the nations finest and brightest engineers to support its
   renowned propulsion program.
