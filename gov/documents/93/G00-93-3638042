   NASA Software to Help Speed Aircraft Departures

   Researchers aim to avert airport gridlock with a new software tool
   being evaluated in NASAs virtual control tower simulator.

   NASA researchers and Dallas/Fort Worth air traffic controllers
   conducted the second evaluation of the Surface Management System (SMS),
   being developed at NASA Ames Research Center located in California's
   Silicon Valley. Current systems used by airports don't provide
   controllers with accurate information about the number of future
   departures. During the various 'rush hour' times at the airport,
   scheduled departures often exceed runway capacity, creating delays. SMS
   reduces delays by creating an integrated master schedule for aircraft
   movement and departures.

   "The main objective of the Surface Management System is to allow the
   controllers and airlines to collaboratively manage departure operations
   and surface movements. The system gathers relevant information from
   multiple sources, processes it, and displays the appropriate
   information and advisories to the users," said Dr. Steve Atkins, SMS
   project lead. "The system has the potential to decrease departure
   delays significantly," he added.

   The information compiled by the system is displayed as aircraft
   location maps, departure timelines and load capacity graphs giving
   controllers timely data to effectively manage aircraft movement between
   the terminal and the runway. With this information, controllers can
   predict possible traffic congestion and rapidly eliminate system
   bottlenecks.

   Ames' FutureFlight Central (FFC) air traffic control tower simulator
   was used for the evaluation. FutureFlight Central gives controllers a
   unique facility to test software tools with its detailed 360° views,
   providing controllers a very realistic experience. The data collected
   will be used to refine the SMS user interface and identify additional
   user features.

   "We presented a spectrum of ideas in front of a group of FAA (Federal
   Aviation Administration) controllers and airline representatives to
   help us focus on what potential capabilities would be most helpful. Our
   ideas have been received positively," said Atkins.

   The realism provided by FFC will allow for the smooth transition to the
   field-test portion of the evaluation. Additional features, such as
   integration with arrival scheduling and integration with other air
   traffic management tools, will be added as part of the staged evolution
   of the tool.

   Other participants in the evaluation were representatives from the
   Federal Aviation Administrations Free Flight Program office, officials
   from major passenger and freight carriers, and controllers from
   Memphis, Tenn., and Norfolk, Va., airports.

   The Surface Management System is being developed at NASA Ames Research
   Center by the Advanced Air Transportation Technologies (AATT) Project,
   a part of the Aviation Systems Capacity Program. NASA Ames has been
   conducting air traffic control research and development since the
   mid-1980s.
