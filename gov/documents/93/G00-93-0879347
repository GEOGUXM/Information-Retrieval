   Definition of the Practice of Public Accountancy

   Education Law, Article 149, section 7401: "The practice of the
   profession of public accountancy is defined as holding one's self out
   to the public, in consideration of compensation received or to be
   received, offering to perform or performing for other persons, services
   which involve signing, delivering or issuing or causing to be signed,
   delivered or issued any financial, accounting or related statement or
   any opinion on, report on, or certificate to such statement, if by
   reason of the signature, or the stationery or wording employed, or
   otherwise, it is indicated or implied that the practitioner has acted
   or is acting, in relation to said financial, accounting or related
   statement, or reporting as an independent accountant or auditor or as
   an individual having or purporting to have expert knowledge in
   accounting or auditing."

     * be at least 21 years of age
     * meet education, examination, and experience requirements

   You must submit an application for licensure and the other forms

   material.

   The specific requirements for licensure are contained in Title 8,
   Article 149, Section 7404 of New York's Education Law and Part 70 of
   the Commissioner's Regulations. Copies of both the NYS Education Law
   and the Commissioner's Regulations are available upon request from the

     __________________________________________________________________

Fees

   The licensure fee is $345.

   Fees are subject to change. The fee due is the one in law when your
   application is received (unless fees are increased retroactively). You
   will be billed for the difference if fees have been increased.
     * Do not send cash.
     * Make your personal check or money order payable to the New York
       State Education Department. Your cancelled check is your receipt.

Education Requirements

   To fulfill the education requirement for licensure, you must complete:

       licensure-qualifying, or
     * a program determined by the Department to be equivalent to a

   or graduate level or by any combination of the two. You must have an
   overall average in the accounting subjects of "C" or better at the
   undergraduate level and "B" or better at the graduate level. Courses in

   New York State recognizes the Uniform CPA Examination, prepared and
   graded by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
   (AICPA). In New York, the examination is administered by CPA
   Examination Services, a division of the National Association of State
   Boards of Accountancy

   The passing score for each of the four examination parts: financial
   accounting and reporting, business law and professional
   responsibilities, accounting and reporting, and auditing is 75.0. You
   will be granted credit when you pass any two or more subjects at a
   single examination administration for such subjects. Thereafter,
   subjects may be passed singly, provided you successfully pass all
   subjects of the examination within a consecutive three-year period.

Reasonable Testing Accommodations

   Applicants with disabilities requesting reasonable accommodations for
   an examination need to contact CPA Examination Services and provide
   several types of documentation by the application filing deadline.

Religious Observance

   If you are seeking accommodations for an examination because of
   religious reasons you must notify CPA Examination Services when you
   file the examination application.
     __________________________________________________________________

Experience Requirements

   An applicant must present evidence, satisfactory to the State Board for
   Public Accountancy, of diversified experience involving the application
   of generally accepted accounting principles and the application of
   generally accepted auditing standards in the practice of public
   accountancy, or the satisfactory equivalent thereof as determined by
   the State Board. The documentation of experience must demonstrate
   diversified experience that would enable the applicant, once licensed,
   to conduct and report on an independent audit of a small but complex
   entity with a minimum of supervision.

   Two years of qualifying experience (full-time or its part-time
   equivalent) are required for licensure. Applicants who have completed
   advanced study in an approved accounting program or its equivalent may
   petition for a waiver of one year of experience. A significant portion
   of public accounting experience - - a minimum of 75% - - must be in the
   areas of auditing services and financial statement preparation; at
   least one-half of this time must consist of auditing services alone.
   Full-time employment is considered to be a 5-day, 35-40 hour week,
   excluding overtime. Acceptable part-time (no less than 20 hours per
   week) experience will be considered on the basis of one week of
   experience for every two weeks worked. See the instructions for
   Employer Form 4b for further detail on qualifying experience.

   In the case of non-public accounting, a minimum of 75% of the
   experience must consist solely of auditing services. Experience in
   private or governmental accounting or auditing of a character and for a
   length of time satisfactory to the State Board may be determined to be
   substantially equivalent to audit experience obtained by independent
   accountants engaged in public practice which includes the attest
   function. This experience shall be devoted principally to the
   comprehensive application of generally accepted accounting principles
   and generally accepted auditing standards to diversified field
   examinations. These examinations shall culminate in the submission of
   independent reports on financial records and statements that are relied
   upon by a third party. Limited scope auditing activities shall not be
   accepted as equivalent experience. See the Board policy statement
   regarding non-public audit experience for further information.

   Experience must be attested to by a CPA licensed in a division of the
   United States or by a public accountant licensed in New York, provided
   such individual supervised the applicant in the employing organization.

   Completing either 1 or 2 below can reduce the experience requirement to
   one year:
    1. the 120 semester hour education requirement described previously as
       "Option 1", plus a post-baccalaureate degree and completion of at
       least 30 graduate semester hours in accounting or business,
       including the following six graduate courses, within or in addition
       to the course of study:
          + advanced auditing
          + economic analysis
          + advanced taxation
          + finance
          + accounting theory
          + quantitative measurements
    2. the 150 semester hour education requirement, including a bachelor's
       or higher degree, described under "Option 2" in the Education
       Requirements.

   Please Note: All requirements listed under 1 or 2 above must be
   completed to earn the one-year experience reduction. No partial
   reductions can be granted.

   If your employer submits a Certification of Employer (Form 4B) where a
   percentage of time is shown in item 7 A, Auditing Services, and the
   part-time box in question #4, Section II on the same form is also
   checked, the employer should provide a statement describing the nature
   of the fieldwork engagements performed for which experience credit is
   claimed, setting forth as much of the following as is practical, and
   indicating the extent to which you have applied generally accepted
   accounting principles and generally accepted auditing standards:
    a. nature, purpose and location of a sample of representative
       engagements and a brief outline of the type of auditing procedures
       employed by the applicant.
    b. the approximate time the applicant was involved on each engagement.
    c. the type of reports issued on each engagement. A sample independent
       audit report on financial records and financial statements must be
       included.

   In addition, item 5 on the form should show the number of hours worked
   per week and the number of weeks or months of the part-time service
   included in the total experience claimed.

   This additional documentation of your experience will be included with
   your file for review by the Licensing Committee.
     __________________________________________________________________

Applicants Licensed in Another State

   If you have been licensed in another jurisdiction and wish to apply for
   licensure by endorsement, you must provide evidence of:
     * Passing a written examination acceptable to the State Board for
       Public Accountancy; and
     * Satisfactory completion of the education and experience requirement
       in New York State; and
     * Good standing as a certified public accountant in each jurisdiction
       in which you have been licensed.

   The State Board for Public Accountancy may accept evidence of five
   years of acceptable public accounting experience following initial
   licensure and within the ten years immediately preceding your
   application for licensure in New York State if, at the time of
   licensure in the other jurisdiction:
     * the licensing standards were not fully equivalent to the current
       New York State standards or,
     * you passed an acceptable examination but under conditions not
       acceptable to New York State (for example, not passing two or more
       parts together prior to passing parts singly or not completing the
       examination within a three year period)
     __________________________________________________________________
