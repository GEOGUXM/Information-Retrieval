                      PBS films for prime time at BL1.4

   A PBS crew filmed at the Advanced Light Source and beamline 1.4.3 for
   their four-part documentary series on microbes, entitled "Intimate
   Strangers: Unseen Life on Earth," scheduled to be aired in November
   1999. The crew interviewed Jennie Hunter-Cevera (far right) and her
   colleagues, and took helicopter shots of the Lab. BL1.4 user Hoi-Ying
   Holman, whose work is featured in the documentary, is pictured next to
   Hunter-Cevera. Producer Julio Moline described the special as "the
   first-ever comprehensive look at microbiology on prime-time
   television." Photo by Roy Kaltschmidt
