     The Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF) project will enable
     the U.S. Court of International Trade and the bar to interact
     electronically. Using the internet -- from anywhere in the world --
     counsel will be able to file documents with the Court electronically,
     and serve opposing counsel as well. Similarly, the Court will be able
     to serve orders and opinions electronically on all counsel. In
     addition, counsel, parties and the public will have instantaneous,
     round-the-clock, "24/7" access to case information and documents, via
     the internet.

     The Court is joining a handful of other "pilot" federal courts across
     the country, taking the lead in implementing CM/ECF (which is expected
     to be in use in all federal courts by 2003). CM/ECF is already used in
     four district courts and five bankruptcy courts -- and the response of
     counsel, parties and court personnel has been enthusiastic. The system
     is uniquely well-suited for the Court of International Trade -- a
     national court, with a national bar and parties scattered around the
     globe.

     Benefits for the legal community and the Court include:

   Access
   -- The ability to view and retrieve documents 24 hours a day, seven
   days a week, 365 days a year, from anywhere in the world, via the
   internet.

   Easy Filing
   -- The ability to file documents 24/7, every day of the year, from
   anywhere, via the internet.

   Instantaneous Notification
   -- The ability to receive immediate notice of new filings with the
   Court.

   Low cost
   -- Use of standard internet software minimizes out-of-pocket costs for
   attorneys (which are more than offset by savings in courier expenses
   and attorney travel time, postage costs, and the expense of maintaining
   and storing paper files).

     Court personnel are working closely with the Administrative Office
     of the U.S. Courts in Washington, D.C. to procure the necessary
     hardware and software to support CM/ECF at the Court, and are
     training Court personnel on the system. The Court plans to
     "troubleshoot" CM/ECF by using it only internally at first. In other
     words, initially counsel will continue to file paper documents with
     the Court; but Clerks Office personnel will electronically "scan"
     those paper documents to create an electronic file (which will be
     accessible only by Court personnel). During 2002, however, the Court
     expects that counsel will begin e-filing documents with the CIT. In
     anticipation, the Courts Advisory Committee is drafting proposals
     for appropriate changes to the Courts Rules, for the consideration
     of the Court.
