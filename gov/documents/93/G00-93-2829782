   Sandia Detective Solves Strange Case

   Sandia National Laboratories scientists finding of a key detail leads to new
   interpretation of water-solid

   interactionsreported in the January 4, 2002, issue of Science.

      January 14, 2002It was a small problem: a layer of water lying flat
      instead of slightly bumpy as it froze on a solid.

      It became a larger problem when no one could explain why that might
      happen.

      The slight difference between experimental results and established
      expectations might have meant nothing. But possibly it was signaling a
      basic scientific misunderstanding concerning the interaction of water
      with solids -- an area of major industrial and scientific concern.

      Water-surface interactions control the rate at which water passes
      through microscopic pores -- a factor of increasing importance in
      micro- and nanotechnology.  These interactions also affect the adhesion
      of materials in humid environments, catalytic chemical reactions, and
      condensation on dust particles in the upper atmosphere, to name a few.

      Eventually, the problem ended up on the desk of theoretical physicist
      Peter Feibelman at the Department of Energy's Sandia National
      Laboratories.  His solution, which theorizes that water molecules
      dissociate near the surface rather than remain intact, is published in
      the January 4 issue of Science.

      "This work makes the goal of understanding what happens when water
      contacts surfaces seem just a bit more achievable," Feibelman said.

      The problem

      Several years ago Munich experimental physicists Georg Held and
      Dietrich Menzel found that the initial layer of water molecules didn't
      lie the way they should on the precious metal ruthenium.

      The researchers knew that ruthenium's surface atoms pack tightly
      together in a hexagonal array. They also knew that water molecules of
      ice crystals do the same, in hexagons only marginally bigger than the
      metal's.  So the experimentalists expected that a frozen layer of water
      molecules would compress slightly and lie on the ruthenium with all the
      normal characteristics of a layer of ice.

      But a small problem intruded from the third dimension: water molecules
      of ice always arrange themselves in puckered hexagons, with half the
      molecules higher and half lower.

      Held and Menzel found no pucker.

      Their layer of (heavy) water on ruthenium was almost perfectly flat.

      Not only shouldn't it be flat, it shouldn't be

      Feibelman saw an opportunity to use modern advances in theory to
      understand interfaces at the atomic level.  "In the past, scientists
      could only summarize what goes on at surfaces by making assumptions
      that were embodied as boundary conditions," he said.  "The problem is
      that there was often no foundation for such simplifications."

      Feibelman hoped to use models faithful to nature at the atomic scale to
      interpret what was going on at the solid-water interface. He already
      had done significant work on the arrangements and movements of atoms on
      the surface of materials. At his desk, he reflected on how the
      chemistry of a solid surface might determine the arrangement of nearby
      water molecules.

      Then he calculated the binding energy of the water molecules in the
      expected puckered structure versus their binding energy in pure ice.
      Feibelman reasoned that if ice is more favorable energetically, then
      water molecules will not want to spread out into a flat,  essentially
      two-dimensional layer on a ruthenium surface, but instead cluster
      together, forming a 3-D "ice cube." And that -- unfortunately -- was
      just what he found. "I realized I was unable to explain why there is a
      2-D layer at all," he said, "to say nothing of why the layer was flat
      instead of puckered."

      Using observed facts rather than conventional assumptions

      Then Feibelman thought, "If you take the experimental observation
      seriously -- that all the oxygens are lying in same plane rather than
      in a puckered structure -- then each oxygen atom is at about the same
      distance from a ruthenium atom.

      "That means all the oxygens should bond to ruthenium atoms. But the
      only way this can happen is if the upper molecules of the expected
      puckered arrangement get rid of one of their deuteriums. Oxygen atoms
      that lose deuteriums will need to bind to something else, and ruthenium
      atoms are the obvious candidate." (Note: the water in Held & Menzel's
      experiments was heavy water -- deuterium replacing hydrogen -- used
      because it produced electron diffraction patterns that were easier to
      analyze.)

      Excited by this idea, Feibelman tried a calculation that assumed
      deuterium atoms broken off from water molecules also would find
      someplace else to bind on the metal surface. His results then appeared
      to answer both the question of why a 2-D layer exists at all, and why
      the oxygen atoms lie in the same plane.

      "Atoms as light as deuterium barely have any effect on electron
      diffraction," said  Feibelman. "Held and Menzel's experiment by itself
      could only tell us where the oxygen atoms were in the heavy water
      layer, but not the deuteriums.  Theory, however, can tell us where they
      lie, and this information leads to a quite new picture of how water
      wets to a metal. My results make it more than a little plausible that
      half the deuteriums separate from the water molecules where they
      originally were."
