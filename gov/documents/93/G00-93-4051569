      The 2nd U.S. District Court of Appeals should be ASHAMMED of themselves
      for the ruling they handed down in the Deborah Zimmerman case. I
      quote,The Denver Post"The term 'human being' was not intended to refer
      to an unborn child." I am not going to try to argue like some
      legalistic lawyer or judge. But why is it when a woman wants to have a
      baby the term"BABY" is used at the begining of the pregnacy, and when
      they do not want it it is something else. Deap down inside we all
      (mankind) knows that life begins at comception. Judges need to check up
      on current scientific studies on when life begins and stop being
      IGNORANT. The courts were not designed for judical activism to take
      place but apparently it does. They need to stop allowing babies to be
      sacrificed.

      date than the Eastern District's Cover Sheet.

      I am trying to find a recent decision by Judge Crabb involving Western
      Financial Bank v. Department of Financial Institutions. Could someone
      possibly post the decision, fax the decision to me (Caryl) at
      202-639-7004 or e-mail it to me at caryl_wheeler@ffhsj.com.

      Thanks very much.

      PACER IS A NATION WIDE SYSTEM AND MY COMPANY ALREADY HAS A LOGIN FOR
      PACER THAT IS GOOD FOR THE DIAL UP VERSION AS WELL AS WEB ACCESS. I
      READ OVER AND OVER THAT I COULD ACCESS PACER THRU MY COMPUTER BUT THERE
      NO PLACE TO INPUT THEM. THE MESSAGE WAS CONFUSING AND IRRITATING AS
      WELL AS A WASTE OF MY TIME, MAKE THIS EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO USE, MAKE IT
      PLAIN WHERE THEY CAN ACCESS YOUR INFOMATION THEU YOUR WEBPAGE OR DON'T
      BOTHER TO TELL ME IT'S THERE.

      I work for a financial institution and represent them in bankrupcty
      cases along with the financial's attorney. I see that Wisconsin has
      PACER and I have registered for this. This is great. However, will
      Wisconsin be using RACER in the near future.

      Thanks Vicky vinman@westbycu.org

      I was told that the cost of filing a Satisfaction of Judgment was
      discoverable on the web site: www.wi.uscourts.gov. That, however,
      yielded me nothing. Finally found site as www.wiw.uscourts.gov but
      still found no fee info. Did, however, discover to which Judge to send
      sat. The human who answered the phone could probably have given me the
      answers in all of ten seconds, and need not have sent me to an
      incorrect web site, but she didn't and she did.

      3 January 2001 I want to thank the assistant systems manager, Mark
      Doerr, for helping me obtain some dockets that I needed. I was on a
      deadline and was having trouble with the dial-up system. Mark kindly
      e-mailed me the dockets I needed - even though he was not obligated to.

      Thanks for your help, Dina Walker

      I'm with the US Department of Labor in Milwaukee. Sentencing in a
      criminal case we investigated is in Judge Shabaz's court. I hadn't been
      to the courthouse for several years and wanted to check the address. I
      was pleasantly surprised to see all the info at this site, including
      driving directions.

      Pacer charges a fee along for their service, where other courts, such
      as state, make the information available without third-party
      assistance. I'd like to see the Federal Courts do this as well.

      Also, it would be nice if you would put what the regions bankrutpcy
      exemptions are (i.e. one house, one car, maximum allowance of 50,000
      dollars, etc.)

      I am a secretary for an attorney in Arizona, and I am trying to find
      out how the local rules of the W. Dist. of Wisconsin differ from the
      standard Federal rules, for example, with regard to pleadings, motions,
      etc. These are provided for the Eastern Dist. of Wisconsin, but not the
      Western District. I only saw four local rules, and they were not
      helpful to me. If I were looking for E. District rules, I'd be very
      satisfied, but since that was not what I needed, I'm right back where I
      started from.

      Hey, I just noticed that your HR position is not posted on the website.
      Don't know how many hits you get per day, but thought you might have
      overlooked it. Marcia (next door in BK court.)
