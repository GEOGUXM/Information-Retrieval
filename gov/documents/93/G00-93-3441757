   Many State of the Science Conferences and Workshops adhere to the NIH
   Consensus Development Conference (CDC) format because the process is
   useful for evaluating complex issues. In the CDC format, NIH State of
   the Science Statements are prepared by a non advocate, non-Federal
   panel of experts, based on: (1) presentations by investigators working
   in areas relevant to the consensus questions typically during a
   1-1/2-day public session; (2) questions and statements from conference
   attendees during open discussion periods that are part of the public
   session, and (3) closed deliberations by the panel during the remainder
   of the second day and morning of the third. Each statement is an
   independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the
   NIH or the Federal Government.

   Other State of the Science Conferences and Workshops are organized
   around unique formats. Usually, speakers present findings or
   perspectives on the issue. The public is invited to address questions
   to the speakers. Policy implications may be discussed. A report of the
   findings can emerge in one of a variety of formats including
   publication in a clinical or scientific journal.
