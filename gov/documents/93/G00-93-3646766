How to give us a piece of your mind...

   The Mission and Spacecraft Library is a free public resource, which
   means that we (the curators) rely on you (the public) to help make the
   resource more valuable for everyone. So if you see a mistake, or
   material that is out of date, or just plain missing, don't be shy about
   telling us! We'll do our best to accomodate your request.

   But since we have limited resources available for researching and
   adding information, you will greatly increase the chance of your
   favorite spacecraft being listed in MSL if you send us a brief summary
   of everything you know about the program. We have provided several
   convenient methods for doing this...

Content Submission Forms

   There are two different versions of this form - one for QuickLook
   pages, and one for Program Pages. Simply fill in the blanks and submit
   the form. Upon receipt, we'll review what you've sent us, and assuming
   the information is correct and won't get us into trouble, we'll place
   it in the database. There are a few things to bear in mind whenever you
   send us something:
    1. By submitting information to MSL, you certify that the material is
       not protected by copyright. In other words, you cannot take
       material from a copyrighted source (such as a magazine or book),
       and submit it verbatim to MSL. This applies to both text and
       pictures.
    2. You waive any future claim to ownership of material created for
       inclusion in MSL. Once we have reviewed the information and placed
       it in MSL, you cannot ask us to remove it.
    3. Final editorial judgment lies with the curators of MSL, who make no
       guarantee that any or all submitted material will be published. If
       we feel something is inappropriate or incorrect, we won't use it.

   However, we do want to give credit where credit is due. If we do use
   any of your information, we'll add your name, e-mail address, and other
   pertinent information to our contributors page along with a brief
   description of the information you provided. So if you know anything
   about a spacecraft that we can add to our library, please drop us a
   line.

General Comments Feedback Form

   Our Feedback form provides a much quicker way to send us a couple bits
   of info without going through the entire QuickLook or Program forms. Or
   you can just use it for general comments. If you see something don't
   like, please let us know. If you see something you do like, let us know
   that too (we like pats on the back just like everybody else!). We're
   especially interested in any comments about what you would like to see
   added to MSL, and what you think MSL should evolve into. And, we'd like
   to know what you're using the data in MSL for.

E-mail

   If your browser doesn't support forms, of if you'd just prefer to use
   e-mail, we can be reached at msl@newspace.com
