      ------ The LANDSAT 7 SOFTWARE section provides access to source code
   for three elements of the U.S. Government Landsat 7 Ground System: the
   Landsat Processing System (LPS); the Image Assessment System (IAS); and
   the Level 1 Product Generation System (LPGS). The source codes are
   provided strictly for informational purposes. The U.S. Government will
   make no effort to ensure that the released source codes compile and run
   on any computer system external to the U.S. Government Landsat 7 Ground
   System.
