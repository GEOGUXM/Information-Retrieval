   The Federal Judiciary will be conducting a series of focus group
   meetings with the users of PACER. These focus group meetings are
   intended to allow local PACER users a chance to meet with national

   showcased and your questions and opinions will be solicited. New Web
   PACER products for District, Bankruptcy, and Appellate Courts along
   with the U.S. Party/Case Index will be demonstrated. The agenda will
   consist of a short video presentation followed by a general
   question/answer session about PACER. The meeting will last
   approximately 90 minutes.
