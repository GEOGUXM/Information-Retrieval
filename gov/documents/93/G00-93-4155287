                          SPDF Coordinated Science

   The general mission of the SPDF is to enhance the scientific return
   from NASA programs in the space physics sciences. One part of this
   mission involves the organization and implementation of programs to
   enable national and international cooperation in addressing correlative
   science objectives. Another part of the mission is to perform space
   physics research in order to contribute directly to the preeminence of
   NASA in space sciences.

   The specific on-going science thrusts of the organization are:

   IACG First Campaign
     * Campaign 1 Home Page

   ISTP Magnetopause Skimming Campaign
     * Skimming Campaign Home Page

   Science Studies in Progress
     * Bow Shock Collaboration

   Many of the services of SPDF directly support the campaigns and
   studies, as well as a wide variety of other work occuring under
   International Solar Terrestrial Program (ISTP), the Inter Agency
   Consultative Group (IACG) and as a part of the International Auroral
   Study (IAS).
