   of employers is any indication. The table below shows the number of
   California employers in some key manufacturing subgroups. Check the
   regional publication in this series to find out how many there are in
   your county. Here are a few ways to find out who's hiring: * Use your
   local resources for leads. If you've been preparing yourself locally,
   then you probably already know who they are, through prior contacts.
   Visit these people and ask their advice. They'll normally be happy to
   help guide a potential future colleague. * Follow the local business
   pages and periodicals found in libraries and bookstores to get the
   names, addresses, and phone numbers of potential employers. * Explore
   the Internet. Start with the sites below for a great series of links
   that'll take you almost anywhere. Or do your own "key word" search if
   there's an aspect of this industry that you're specially interested in.
   Plan well, and good fortune to you! California Employers We make the
   stuff of your life. We have to plan how we're going to do all this,

   we'll get it from us to you, how long it'll take. We have to make sure
   you want it. Then we have to beat the competition. We have to maintain
   the right supply in relation to your demand. We have to determine a lot
   of costs: raw materials, transportation, machinery, labor, energy,

   . Finding a job easily and job security are usually tied to how hard it
   is for employers to find good employees. The table below shows that
   employers find it more difficult for some In California, we makers of
   the world export about a fifth of the nation's computers, electronics,
   jobs. That affects income. instruments, and food products. While other
   industries are growing at greater rates, we are one of the largest,
   with 13% of total California jobs. Generally, income level is tied to
   training and education. Few industries show this as clearly as
   California makers have responded dynamically to new frontiers
   throughout California's history. Not manufacturing, at least when
   you're starting off. MBAs from name schools regularly start work long

   start in the $75-85,000 range. Persons with bachelors degrees start for
   about half that. (Check it out for yourself with an Internet search  we

   Manufacturing Should be, if the number of employers is any indication.
   The table below shows the number of California employers in some key
   manufacturing subgroups. Check the regional publication in this series
   to find out how many there are in your county. Here are a few ways to
   find out who's hiring: * Use your local resources for leads. If you've
   been preparing yourself locally, then you probably already know who
   they are, through prior contacts. Visit these people and ask their
   advice. They'll normally be happy to help guide a potential future
   colleague. * Follow the local business pages and periodicals found in
   libraries and bookstores to get the names, addresses, and phone numbers
   of potential employers. * Explore the Internet. Start with the sites
   below for a great series of links that'll take you almost anywhere. Or
