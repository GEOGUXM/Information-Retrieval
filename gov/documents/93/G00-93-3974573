     On behalf of the people of the state of Vermont I want to extend my
   deepest condolences to all those whose loved ones were lost or injured
    as a result of the horrific attacks on Tuesday, September 11. I also
    wish to express my gratitude to the emergency personnel who have done
     such an extraordinary job in the aftermath. The United States is a
   resilient nation. We will recover. My hope is that out of this tragedy
   we will become more united, more compassionate and more understanding.
