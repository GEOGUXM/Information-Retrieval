   The information displayed in the attached plots represent the "raw"
   weather data (non- QA/QC'd data) obtained from meteorological stations
   operated by NOAA/ATDD within the East Tennessee region. Due to the
   remote location of a number of the meteorological stations, data must
   be acquired through radio telemetry transmission. Data retrieval is
   therefore subject to the many atmospheric conditions which may disrupt
   communications. Data plots are updated as new information is acquired.
