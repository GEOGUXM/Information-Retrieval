   Washington tribal tourism director hired

   OLYMPIA - As part of an ongoing effort to bring economic vitality to
   tribes through culturally appropriate tourism, the Affiliated Tribes of
   Northwest Indians Economic Development Corporation (ATNI-EDC) and the
   Governor's Office of Indian Affairs (GOIA) announced today that Donna
   Wilkie, a Makah Tribal member, has been recruited to head up a new
   federally-funded Washington state Tribal tourism promotion campaign.

   Wilkie, who has worked in the tourism industry for many years, most
   recently as the land use and tourism planner for the Makah Tribe, began
   her position earlier this month. She has served on several tourism and
   economic development committees in the region. Ms. Wilkie has a
   bachelor's degree in American Indian Studies from the University of
   Washington, and is the only tribal representative on the Washington
   Tourism Commission.

   "We are thrilled that someone of Donna's caliber is willing to embark
   on building this state-wide tourism development effort," said Mark
   Ufkes, ATNI-EDC Executive Director. "She knows Indian Country well. Her
   tourism industry experience, and her passion for Tribal culture, should
   serve the Tribes well."

   Earlier this year - as part of Gov. Gary Locke's mandate to create
   "real jobs in Indian Country" - the Governor's Office of Indian Affairs
   and the Office of Trade and Economic Development released the first
   ever in-depth assessment of tribal tourism in Washington State. The
   assessment acted as catalyst for the tribes to apply for and be awarded
   a $300,000 Administration for Native Americans grant to implement a
   statewide tribal tourism development effort. Through a partnership with
   ATNI, the grant will fund the tribal tourism coordinator position.
   Wilkie's duties will include producing an inter-tribal tourism
   conference in 2002, a Native tourism Web site and a Washington tribal
   color travel brochure that will include tourism and entertainment
   resources for every tribe in the state. "The tourism brochure will be
   the first ever, to be developed by, and for, tribes and tribal
   enterprises in Washington," said Ufkes.

   Statewide, tourism is a $10.6 billion industry. Yet, many tribes have
   been unable to generate viable tourism products due to a lack of
   infrastructure and economic development planning.

   "We are seeing a growing interest in Indian Country, and exciting
   opportunities in tourism," said Wilkie. "Tribes are expanding on their
   gaming operations and are finding it easier to succeed in the resort
   business. Tourism is a natural extension."

   Wilkie also stressed that "tourism without compensation is just
   traffic." "Our goal is to create culturally appropriate experiences for
   tourists, without damaging our tribal communities and tribal cultures,"
   she said.

   Walter Jackson, executive director of the Quileute tribe, and chair of
   ATNI-EDC's Economic Development and Tourism subcommittee said a recent
   study found that Washington's tribes already contribute more than $1
   billion to the state's economy through tribal programs and tribal
   enterprises. "Tourism can bring additional revenues to tribes,
   surrounding communities and the state," he said.

   "Tourism, and local travel - especially after the September 11
   terrorist attacks - has become more important to economic opportunity,"
   said Ufkes. "Indian Country tourism in Washington has tremendous
   potential for growth as a result. The economic and job creation impacts
   are strong, considering that 27 of Washington's tribes are located in
   rural areas, where previous economic growth has been limited."

   In September, the state released a 60-page publication, entitled Tribal
   Tourism In Washington State, detailing how individual tribes are
   currently using tourism as a source of economic development, barriers
   and concerns related to tourism projects, infrastructure and assistance
   needed to create additional products, and ideas for future tourism
   opportunities. Twenty-seven tribes participated in interviews during
   the yearlong assessment process.

   According to the study, several themes emerged in common for most
   tribes. Needs and desires for tourism development vary depending on a
   tribe's location, culture, size and access to financial, natural and
   human resources. Tribal leaders consistently mentioned infrastructure,
   cultural protection and marketing as areas of special concern as they
   relate to tourism development.

   The activities and products various tribes said they would like to
   promote range from annual powwows and festivals to destination resorts
   and cultural centers.

   There are 29 federally recognized tribes in Washington State. Two
   additional tribes are awaiting federal recognition status. With more
   than 3.25 million acres of reservation land throughout the state, the
   tribal population of Washington is 107,219.
