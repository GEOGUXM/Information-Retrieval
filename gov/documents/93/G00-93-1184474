   Viewer Privacy and Security Notice

   If you're here, you probably have a question about this web site and
   how you are 'seeing it'. The difficulty you are experiencing may be
   associated with a sound or video file, or you wonder why the pages look
   funny. We hope this page will answer your questions.

   What's here?

   The USFA web site is updated 24-hours per day, 7-days per week. USFA
   web pages are organized into several major sections, each with its own
   main subject or homepage page. These sections include:
     * About USFA
     * National Fire Academy
     * National Fire Data Center
     * Fire Safety
     * Publications
     * Kids' Page
     * Arson Prevention
     * Hotel-Motel Master List
     * Firefighters' Memorial
     * Learning Resource Center

Which browser is best to use?

   The USFA Web pages are best viewed using Netscape 3.0 or above or
   Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 or above (for Mac) and 3.0 or above
   (for Windows). You can download a browser at the Netscape site or the
   Microsoft site.

   However, we have done everything we can to accomodate viewing with
   other browsers. You may find that some pages don't look quite "right".
   This is due to differences between browsers. This is especially true of
   Web browsers which are still in beta development.

   The proper width to view our pages is approximately 620 pixels. Resize
   your window to the end of this line.

Bookmark the USFA Homepage

   To add the USFA web site to your browser's list of favorite sites,
   select ADD in the Favorites or BookMarks Menu item.

Messy looking Text

   If you have an old version of a browser or a browser other than
   Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer, our layout may not look right.
   This is probably caused by your browser not understanding the TABLE
   tag. This HTML extension allows folks like us to format a page with
   multiple columns, align text and images in neat formats, and the such.
   If you're not sure if your browser understands tables, here's a little
   test:

   This is a cell in a table
                            This is another cell in a table

   If you see the last two sentences side-by-side, your browser supports
   tables. If not, it doesn't.

What are Frames?

   Frames are much like tables, but have more versatility. Frames break up
   a page into several mini-pages all on one screen, which are independent
   from one another. Each frame can have its own URL address, so you can
   click a link in one frame and view the corresponding information in
   another frame. Frames are often used for navigation by putting the
   navigational bar in one frame and corresponding pages in another. You
   must have Netscape 2.0 or above or Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 or
   above (for Mac) and 3.0 or above (for windows) to see frames. At the
   present time, USFA does not routinely use the frame technique.

What are Plug-ins?

   Plug-ins are software programs that extend the capabilities of web
   browsers in a specific way - giving you, for example, the ability to
   play audio samples, view video movies from within a browser and view
   documents over the Web that look just as they do when created.

The Acrobat Reader

   PDF ABOUT PORTABLE DOCUMENT FORMAT (PDF)

   Get Acrobat Reader Introduction to Adobe Acrobat and
   Portable Document Format (PDF)

   Many documents on the USFA web site are published using Adobe's®
   Portable Document Format (PDF) and may be displayed or printed exactly
   as USFA created them. To display or print the document, you must
   download the free Acrobat® Reader from the Adobe web site. The Acrobat®
   Reader allows anyone to view, navigate, and print PDF documents. Follow
   the easy instructions included with the software to install Acrobat®
   Reader on your computer. Then click any PDF file to view, navigate, or
   print it. For assistance in troubleshooting problems with Acrobat®
   Reader, please refer to Acrobat Customer Support and the Reader's
   online help. Information on PDF access for the visually impaired may be
   found on the Access at Adobe web site.

Help with MS Word Documents

   USFA makes wide use of MS Office 97 in its day to day operations.
   Consequently, many documents on this web site are made available in the
   default Office 97 format. A common solution for users without Office 97
   software is to acquire and use a Word Viewer. Microsoft makes such
   software available on its web site. Select one of the links below to
   download a Word Viewer from Microsoft.

   Viewer for Word 97 on PCs using Windows 95/98 or Windows NT
   With the Microsoft® Word Viewer 97, Microsoft Word users can share
   documents with those who do not have Word and users without Word can
   open and view Word documents. This product also allows users who wish
   to post rich-formatted Word documents on the Internet to expand their
   online audience to people who might not have Word. This viewer also
   allows users to view and print documents created in the Word native
   file format, even if they do not have Word. Users are allowed to zoom,
   outline, or view page layout, headers/footers, footnotes, and
   annotations.

Sound & Images

   Some web browsers cannot display certain graphic formats and cannot
   play certain sound formats "on their own". All of the pictures on our
   pages are in JPEG or GIF format and are viewable by most browsers.

   Our audio files are in .ra (RealAudio) format.

   Below are some platform specific "helper applications" for viewing
   JPEGs and playing .ra files.

   Please note that all of these applications are either freeware or
   shareware, and that their listing here does not constitute any
   guarantee by USFA that they will work with your system.
