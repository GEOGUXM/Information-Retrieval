                                                             Success Story
        Alex Deason, Idaho Falls High School, and Mark Richardson, Hillcrest
          High School, will present Software Program for the Two-Dimensional
      Simulation of Surface-Dependent Microbial Growth, their summer Student
     Action Team (SAT) project, at the 101st General Meeting of the American
           Society for Microbiology, May 20 - 24, 2001, in Orlando, Florida.
           Technical mentors for the SAT were Daphne Stoner, Biotechnologies
                   Department, and Randall Laviolette, Chemistry Department

   The INEEL offers a career development opportunity for high school
   students to team up with scientific and technical experts at the Lab.
   During an 8-week summer program, students are immersed in a research or
   applied project. Students are given opportunities to learn and apply
   science, mathematics, engineering, and technology concepts that
   reinforce as well as complement and go beyond a typical high school
   curriculum. Students are given confidence-building opportunities that
   deepen their knowledge and strengthen their career interests in
   science, mathematics, engineering, and technology.

   To accomplish this, students work in teams that conduct research, carry
   out work-based projects, and solve real-world problems. A team may
   consist of junior and/or senior high school students, a pre-service or
   practicing teacher, and a technical mentor from the laboratory.

   The Student Action Team (SAT) program is open to students who are 16
   years or older and enrolled in an educational program as defined by the
   State of Idaho. Students must be U. S. citizens or Permanent Resident
   Aliens. Students who demonstrate an intellectual curiosity and
   enthusiasm for learning, leadership, and self-motivation for
   improvement are accepted into the program. Selection for the program is
   based on completion of the application process, demonstrated
   accomplishment in academic coursework, statement of interest, one
   teacher recommendation, and results of an interview. Students who have
   completed this process will be placed in pools from which technical
   mentors will draw their selections for projects. As a result of this
   experience, students develop valuable collegial relations. They develop
   communication skills in writing and speaking and skills in using
   technology. They identify and solve problems. They develop skills in
   teamwork and self-discipline.

   Students will receive a non-taxed stipend for their participation in
   the 8-week program. Stipends are paid at the end of each month.
   Students may earn three undergraduate credits through the University of
   Idaho that can be applied toward a degree. The quality of the work
   submitted for credit must be equal to that of college-level work. The
   syllabus requirements must be met. In general, the coursework will
   focus on the development of products or solutions to applied or
   research projects.

   Program dates are June 18, 2001 - August 10, 2001. To participate in
   this program, contact Brenda Greenhalgh at the Idaho National
   Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, P. O. Box 1625, MS3810, Idaho
   Falls, ID 83415, or using the link below.
