     NOW HEAR THIS! NOW HEAR THIS! The ship will be getting underway. All
     hands make preparations for sea. Start the engines! Cast off the
     lines! Let's get underway for the adventure of a lifetime!

     Visit NOAA's marine scientists and surveyors of today as they study
     and survey the oceans of the World. At any given time on any given
     day, there are NOAA ships making oceanographic observations,
     studying and protecting marine mammals, conducting fisheries stock
     assessments, surveying our harbors and waterways, servicing
     oceanographic buoys, or conducting any of a myriad of tasks and
     operations that help us better understand, protect, and wisely use
     the ocean and its resources. NOAA's vessels range from the 274-foot
     RONALD H. BROWN to small skiffs used for inshore work in a variety
     of settings. Over the years, NOAA ships have worked in all oceans,
     circum-navigated the Earth, and operated north of the Arctic Circle
     and south of the Antarctic Circle. They have visited every
     continent. They have worked in virtually all climates: from frigid
     polar regions to torrid equatorial regions and experienced all
     climatic conditions in between. Also visit the ships and boats of
     yesteryear, as NOAA's maritime heritage extends back to the early
     Nineteenth Century.

     Recent NOAA ship travels have included: the RONALD H. BROWN
     completing an around the world cruise this past year; the McARTHUR
     sailing the length of the West Coast and then throughout the eastern
     tropical Pacific; the FERREL working in coastal waters ranging from
     New England to the central Gulf of Mexico; the MILLER FREEMAN
     traversing areas from the Aleutian Islands to San Francisco while
     conducting fisheries studies; and the KA'IMIMOANA cruising the seas
     of the equatorial Pacific helping monitor El Nino/La Nina events. On
     the charting side, NOAA vessels worked from Maine to Texas as well
     as in U. S. Caribbean islands in the Atlantic and in all U.S. states
     and territories bordering the Pacific Ocean.

     Sail with NOAA on these trips in our coastal waters, from polar seas
     to equatorial waters, and back in time with the ships of our past.
     Join NOAA as it sails for science and does its part to better
     understand and protect the World's oceans.
