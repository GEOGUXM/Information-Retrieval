      In the hours following a solar flare we often see a series of loops
      above the surface of the Sun. These loops are best seen when viewed in
      the light emitted by hydrogen in the red region of the solar spectrum
      (H-alpha emission). The loops shown to the left formed after an active
      region (AR 7205) flared on June 26, 1992. Time-lapse movies (3.5 MB
      Quicktime movie or 1.3 MB MPEG movie) show how material "condenses" out
      of the Sun's hot corona in tops of these loops and then flows down the
      legs of the loops onto the surface. Within the magnetic confines of
      these  loops the material is somewhat isolated from the million degree
      corona and can cool to much lower temperatures. These particular loops
      are of interest because they include a set of "bent-over" loops that
      figure prominently in theoretical models for some flares.

      The velocity of the material flowing in these loops can be determined
      using the "Doppler effect." The light from material moving toward us is
      shifted toward the blue end of the spectrum while light from material
      moving away from us is shifted toward the red end. The image at the
      left shows the Doppler shift of the H-alpha emission. This information
      can be used  with the observed motion of the material (3.5 MB Quicktime
      movie or 2.4 MB MPEG movie) to determine the three-dimensional flow of
      material within these loops. We find that the loops form an arcade, a
      series placed one after another to form a tunnel-like structure. The
      "bent-over" loop threads through the arcade with footpoints on opposite
      sides on the opposite ends.

      These observations were obtained with the Swedish Solar Telescope on
      LaPalma in the Canary Islands by T. Tarbell (Lockheed/Palo Alto) and
      the data was provided through B. Schmieder (Observatoire de Paris,
      Meudon). The scientific results can be found in a paper by Moore,
      Schmieder, Hathaway, and Tarbell,  Solar Physics 176, pp 153-169
      (1997).
