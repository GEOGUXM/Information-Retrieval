   achieve the purposes of the Act. Meetings and work of the Committee
   shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5 of the Act as well as
   the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.


   3.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration,
   Bureau of Export Administration, provides clerical and appropriate
   support services for the Committee.

   and other expenses incurred by them in connection with their duties as

   DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE




                             REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES TECHNICAL ADVISORY
   COMMITTEE





   Notice of Determination




   In response to requests from representatives of a substantial segment
   of industries affected by the Export Administration Regulations and
   pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. Sec. 2404(h)(1)(part of the Export
   Administration Act of 1979, as amended) (50 U.S.C. app. Secs.
   2401-2420), the Secretary of Commerce established the Regulations and
   Procedures Technical Advisory Committee.  The Committee advises the
   Department of Commerce with respect to the following issues: (a)
   technical specifications and policy relating to those specifications;
   (b) worldwide availability of products and systems, including the
   quantity, quality, and use of production technology; (c) licensing
   procedures that affect the level of export controls applicable to
   equipment or technology; (d) revisions of the Commerce Control List (as
   provided in subsection (c)(4)), including proposed revisions of
   multilateral controls in which the United States participates; (e) the
   issuance of regulations; and (f) any other questions relating to
   actions designed to carry out the policy set forth in Section 3(2)(A)
   of this Act.


   The Committee, which currently has members representing industry and
   Government agencies, will terminate no later than December 1, 2002,
   unless extended by the Secretary of Commerce or his designee.  All
   members of the Committee have appropriate security clearances.


   The Committee's activities are conducted pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app.
   Sec. 2404(h); the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as
   amended (5 U.S.C. app. 2); and 41 C.F.R. Subpart 101-6.10, Federal
   Advisory Committee Management Rule.


   5 U.S.C. app. 2 Sec. 10(d) provides that advisory committee meetings,
   or portions thereof, may be exempt from the open meeting and public
   participation requirement of the Federal Advisory Committee Act if the
   head of the agency to which the advisory committee reports determines
   such meetings may be closed to the public in accordance with the
   Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b(c)).


   5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(1) provides that agency meetings, or portions thereof,
   may be closed to the public when they are likely to disclose matters
   that are specifically authorized by an Executive Order to be kept
   secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, provided
   they are properly classified under the criteria established by such
   Executive Order.


   Since the Committee was originally chartered, the Department has
   approved Notices of Determination authorizing the closing of meetings,
   or portions thereof, of the Committee and its Subcommittees dealing
   with security classified matters.


   To provide advice to the Department under the terms of its Charter, the
   Committee and its Subcommittees will hold a series of meetings dealing
   with the matters set forth in the first paragraph of this
   Determination.  These meetings will include discussions of the
   commodities and technical data on the Commerce Control List and the
   foreign availability of these items.  In addition, the Committee and
   its Subcommittees will prepare reports and recommendations for the
   Department's consideration relating to the U.S. Government's
   negotiating position on export control-related matters.  Pursuant to
   Executive Order 12958 (60 Fed. Reg. 19825 (1995)), the Government has
   classified or will classify much of the information relating to the
   Commerce Control List, as well as proposed changes, for national
   defense or foreign policy reasons.  For the Committee and its
   Subcommittees to provide required advice to the U.S. Government, the
   Department must provide the Committee and its Subcommittees with such
   classified material.  Therefore, provided the material is properly
   classified under the criteria established by such Executive Order, the
   Department must close to the public the series of Committee and
   Subcommittee meetings, or portions thereof, that will involve
   discussions of matters specifically authorized by Executive Order to be
   kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.  The
   remaining meetings or portions of meetings will be open to the public.


   Accordingly, I hereby determine, pursuant to Section 10(d) of the
   Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. app. 2 Sec.
   10(d)), that the series of meetings or portions of meetings of the
   Committee and of any Subcommittees thereof dealing with materials
   properly classified pursuant to an Executive Order, shall be exempt
   from the provisions relating to public meetings found in 5 U.S.C. app.
   2 Sec. 10(a)(1) and 10(a)(3).  The remaining series of meetings or
   portions thereof will be open to the public.  This determination shall
   be effective from the date of the signing of this determination to
   December 1, 2002.
