                         ENERGY STAR Program Support

   The end-use forecasting team provides extensive analytical support for
   the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's voluntary ENERGY STAR
   programs. EPA uses the ENERGY STAR label to recognize and promote the
   most energy efficient products, thereby tapping market forces to
   promote energy efficiency and reduce pollution. We use technology and
   market data to help EPA target their marketing and design new programs,
   addressing most end-uses in the building sector.
