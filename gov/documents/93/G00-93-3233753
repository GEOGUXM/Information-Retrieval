   The Group:

   Howard Robinson (631) 344-4789
   Randall McNally (631) 344-5642
     __________________________________________________________________

   Research Interests:

   High throughput x-ray crystallography: Improvements in data collection
   at synchrotron sites, and simplified analysis of structures determined
   from MAD data. Bio-structure engineering: Protein mechanical
   engineering, high temperature stabilization of proteins, swapping of
   catalytic assemblies into new proteins. Cryo-electron microscopy:
   Techniques for interpretation of low resolution structures with high
   resolution derived structural information.


   [robinson_field.jpg] Howard Robinson's group focuses on facilitating
   access to synchrotrons for a broad spectrum of Biology and
   Biotechnology research scientists. Training is the primary tool used to
   provide this expanded access, and this training is a combination of
   experience at the beamline and also web-based training tutorials. The
   group also provides a mail-in x-ray crystallographic service with
   extremely rapid turn-around time, typically about two weeks. He carries
   out his research at several of the consortium PX beamlines.
