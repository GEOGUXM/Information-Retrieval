               National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA)

     SAMHSA's National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA)  is the
     primary source of information on the prevalence, patterns, and
     consequences of drug and alcohol use and abuse in the general U.S.
     civilian non institutionalized population, age 12 and older.  It is
     conducted by SAMHSA's Office of Applied Studies (OAS).  Occasionally
     OAS produces methodology reports, detailed tables, and other NHSDA
