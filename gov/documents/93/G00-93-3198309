                               Project Organization


   an overview of the different services, activities and collaboration
   methods used for the practical organization of the Principia
   Cybernetica Project, as contrasted with its theoretical results.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Principia Cybernetica attempts to build its cybernetic philosophy
      through collaboration between participants from all around the world.
      The project is managed by an editorial board, which is responsible for
      the production, maintenance and selection of the material. Everybody
      interested can contribute to the material being developed. Editors and
      contributors together use various computer-supported methods of
      collaboration, mostly through the new electronic media of the Internet.

      Direct discussions among the contributors, and announcements of new
      developments, take place on the PCP-discuss and PCP-news electronic
      mailing lists. General news about the project, new web documents, and
      discussion topics on PCP-discuss are summarized in a bimonthly, free
      electronic newsletter, called "Principia Cybernetica News".

      The results produced by the project are maintained and made publically
      available on our website, which is organized so as to make information
      easily retrievable and semantically structured. There also exists an
      older FTP-server, which is kept as a repository for some texts (e.g.
      papers) that were not formatted in HTML or PDF.

      Although most of the collaboration takes place electronically, PCP also
      deploys more traditional academic activities, such as the organization
      of conferences and the publication of books or articles in scientific
      journals. This ensures the accessibility of PCP's results even to
      people who are not using the Internet, although the focus is wholly on
      publishing everything on the web. The editors try in general to make
      the project's results publically known, in the hope of attracting new
      contributors, and they are interested in the different reactions
      elicited by the project, so that they can constantly improve the
      material, correcting mistakes or wrong impressions.

      The project also supports some associated organizations whose interests
      overlap with PCP, such as the Journal of Memetics and the Global Brain
      Group (which can in a sense be seen as "spin-offs" of PCP). For a
      formal list with the names and addresses of the people involved,
      associated organizations, and services provided, check the project's
      masthead.
