   Deep Space 1 launched from Cape Canaveral on October 24, 1998. During a
   highly successful primary mission, it tested 12 advanced, high-risk
   technologies in space. In an extremely successful extended mission, it
   encountered comet Borrelly and returned the best images and other
   science data ever from a comet. During its fully successful
   hyperextended mission, it conducted further technology tests. The
   spacecraft was retired on December 18, 2001
