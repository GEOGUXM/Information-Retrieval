      Left to right from top-left: (1) Software Development Model prototype of
      2003 flight rover. (2) Sojourner, the Pathfinder flight rover, based on
      Rocky 4 and very similar to Rocky 3 in perception and control; (3) Rocky
      7, a next generation prototype for the 2003 mission, with stereo vision
      and sampling manipulator. (4) Nanorover, a prototype for a comet mission
      with a very small rover. (5) Rocky 3, with laser light stripe obstacle
      detection and behavior control; (6) Gofor, with active center of gravity
      compensation; (7) Robby, with stereo vision and a puma manipulator; (8)
      The "blue" rover, a three segment early prototype;

   The Robotic Vehicles Group performs research, development, and tests of
   mobile robots in support of planetary exploration missions and
   terrestrial applications for NASA and other Government agencies.
   Current operational vehicles range from microrovers weighing under 5
   kilograms that are designed for planetary exploration, to 3,000
   kilogram military trucks, to rover testbeds with demonstrated
   cross-country autonomous navigation capability. Other vehicles include
   teleoperated robots for investigation of hazardous materials spills.
   Current activities include the development of an autonomous,
   behavior-controlled microrover for science and sample acquisition on
   the Moon and Mars. The group carries out research in:
     * Machine vision
     * Terrain geometry estimation
     * Local and global vehicle position estimation
     * Vehicle control and stability estimation
     * Surface properties estimation

   An emerging research area involves coordinating mobility and
   manipulation, then combining them with active force control to
   accommodate imprecise knowledge either of the terrain or of the motion
   of the base on which the robotic arm is mounted.

   Activities range from basic research in stereo vision to extensive
   vehicle integration programs that include sensors, actuators, power,
   and communication systems. Powerful control stations that include
   stereographic displays for the operator have been developed for
   effective vehicle commanding. Detailed evaluation and testing of
   vehicle performance in relevant terrains are major elements of each
   program.
