    Northern Arizonas San Francisco Volcanic Field, much of which lies
      within Coconino and Kaibab National Forests, is an area of young
   volcanoes along the southern margin of the Colorado Plateau. During its
        6-million-year history, this field has produced more than 600
       volcanoes. Their activity has created a topographically varied
    landscape with forests that extend from the Piñon-Juniper up to the
       Bristlecone Pine life zones. The most prominent landmark is San
      Francisco Mountain, a stratovolcano that rises to 12,633 feet and
            serves as a scenic backdrop to the city of Flagstaff.

   The San Francisco Volcanic Field, which covers about 1,800 square
   miles, is part of northern Arizonas spectacular landscape. Much of the
   field lies within Coconino and Kaibab National Forests. Forest life
   zones in the region range from Piñon-Juniper at lower elevations
   through Ponderosa Pine to Fir and Bristlecone Pine at the highest
   elevations. The varied forests and geologic features of the San
   Francisco Volcanic Field offer diverse recreational opportunities,
   including camping, hiking, mountain biking, wildlife viewing, and
   winter sports.

   includes Arizonas highest point, Humphreys Peak at 12,633 feettower
   over the ruins of an ancient Native American pueblo in Wupatki National
   Monument. The ancient inhabitants of this area must have witnessed the
   eruption of nearby Sunset Crater, the States youngest volcano, which
    erupted in about A.D. 1064. San Francisco Mountain and Sunset Crater
   are only two of the hundreds of volcanoes in the San Francisco Volcanic
      Field, which covers about 1,800 square miles of northern Arizona.

   This digital elevation model (DEM) of the San Francisco Volcanic Field
    shows many of the more than 600 vents which have erupted in the area
   during the past 6 million years. Some lava flows (flat lobate features)
     are easily recognized by their proximity to vents. Larger tectonic
    structures such as the northeast-trending Mesa Butte Fault and Doney
    Fault are also seen. Flagstaff lies at the south-central edge of the
      volcanic field nestled between the base of Elden Mountain and the
              Observatory Mesa flow emitted from A-1 Mountain.

   Almost all hills and mountains between Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon
   are geologically young but extinct volcanoes of the San Francisco
   Volcanic Field. Without the volcanoes, this region would be a flat,
   arid plateau. Instead, the area includes both Arizonas highest
   mountainSan Francisco Mountain, with peaks rising to 12,633 feetand
   the States youngest volcanoSunset Crater, which erupted less than
   1,000 years ago and has been a National Monument since 1930.

   Why does Northern Arizona have so many geologically young volcanoes?
   Most volcanoes are located near boundaries of the Earths tectonic
   plates, but Arizona is well within the interior of the North American
   Plate. Some geologists suggest that there is a site of localized
   melting, or hot spot, fixed deep within the Earths mantle beneath
   northern Arizona. As the North American Plate moves slowly westward
   over this stationary source of molten rock (magma), eruptions produce
   volcanoes that are strung out progressively eastward.

   The first volcanoes in the San Francisco Volcanic Field began to erupt
   about 6 million years ago, in an area where the town of Williams is
   now. Subsequently, a several-mile-wide belt of successively younger
   eruptions migrated eastward, to the area of modern Flagstaff, and even
   a bit beyond, toward the valley of the Little Colorado River. Today,
   this belt of volcanoes extends about 50 miles from west to east.

   Although there has been no eruption for nearly 1,000 years, it is
   likely that eruptions will occur again in the San Francisco Volcanic
   Field. With an average interval of several thousand years between past
   periods of volcanic activity, it is impossible to forecast when the
   next eruption will occur. U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists
   believe that the most probable sites of future eruptions are in the
   eastern part of the field and that the eruptions are likely to be
   small. These future eruptions may provide spectacular volcanic displays
   but should pose little hazard because of their small size and the
   relative remoteness of the area.

   Volcanoes and Types of Magma

   A volcano is an opening where magma erupts onto the surface as lava
   after rising from deep within the Earth. Not all magma is the same.
   Some magma contains as much as 75% silica (SiO2), whereas other magma
   contains as little as about 50%. The more silica in a magma, the higher
   its viscosity, or resistance to flow. Viscosity controls the type of
   volcano that forms. Eruptions of high-viscosity magma build very
   steep-sided lava domes. Low-viscosity magma produces cinder cones and
   thin sheet-like lava flows, and intermediate-viscosity magma creates
   moderately steep mountains called stratovolcanoes.

   Most of the more than 600 volcanoes in the San Francisco Volcanic Field
   are basalt cinder cones. Basalt has the lowest viscosity of all common
   magmas. Cinder cones are relatively small, usually less than 1,000 feet
   tall, and form within months to years. They are built when gas-charged
   frothy blobs of basalt magma are erupted as an upward spray, or lava
   fountain. During flight, these lava blobs cool and fall back to the
   ground as dark volcanic rock containing cavities created by trapped gas
   bubbles. If small, these fragments of rock are called cinders and, if
   larger, bombs. As the fragments accumulate, they build a cone-shaped
   hill. Once sufficient gas pressure has been released from the supply of
   magma, lava oozes quietly out to form a lava flow. This lava typically
   squeezes out from the base of the cone and tends to flow away for a
   substantial distance because of its low viscosity. SP Crater, 25 miles
   north of Flagstaff, is an excellent example of a cinder cone and its
   associated lava flow.

      Photograph showing SP Crater, a cinder cone in the San Francisco
     Volcanic Field, near Flagstaff, Arizona, USA SP Crater, in the San
   Francisco Volcanic Field, is an excellent example of a cinder cone and
    associated lava flow. This flow extends 4 miles from the cone and is
                         only about 100 feet thick.

   Stratovolcanoes

   Stratovolcanoes have moderately steep slopes and form by the
   accumulation of layer upon layer of intermediate-viscosity (andesite)
   lava flows, cinders, and ash, interspersed with deposits from volcanic
   mudflows (lahars) at lower elevations. These tall, cone-shaped
   volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier, Washington, and Mount Fuji, Japan,
   normally rise to a central peak and are built up by countless eruptions
   over hundreds of thousands of years.

   San Francisco Mountain is the only stratovolcano in the San Francisco
   Volcanic Field and was built by eruptions between about 1 and 0.4
   million years ago. Since then, much of the mountain has been removed to
   create the Inner Basin. The missing material may have been removed
   quickly and explosively by an eruption similar to the 1980 eruption of
   Mount St. Helens, Washington, or it may have been removed slowly and
   incrementally by a combination of large landslides, water erosion, and
   glacial scouring.

   Lava Domes

   The San Francisco Volcanic Field also includes several lava domes. Lava
   domes are formed by dacite and rhyolite magmas, which have high silica
   contents. Dacite and rhyolite are so viscous that they tend to pile up
   and form very steep-sided bulbous masses (domes) at the site of
   eruption. Domes can be active for decades or sometimes centuries. If a
   lava dome grows entirely by internal inflation, similar to a balloon,
   it is called an endogenous dome. If, however, magma breaks out through
   a domes flank during inflation and adds new lava layers to the outer
   surface, the final dome is called exogenous.

   Elden Mountain, at the eastern outskirts of Flagstaff, is an excellent
   example of an exogenous dacite dome and consists of several overlapping
   lobes of lava. Sugarloaf Mountain, at the entrance to San Francisco
   Mountains Inner Basin, is a rhyolite lava dome. This dome is thought
   to be endogenous, but its forest cover hides direct evidence of its
   internal structure.

      Photograph of ELden Mountain, a lava dome that is part of the San
   Francisco Volcanic Field near Flagstaff, Arizona, USA Elden Mountain is
   a steep-sided lava dome in the San Francisco Volcanic Field. Lava domes
      are formed by dacite and rhyolite magmas, which have high silica
   contents. Dacite and rhyolite are so viscous that they tend to pile up
       and form very steep-sided bulbous masses (domes) at the site of
                                  eruption.

   The work of USGS scientists, in cooperation with the U.S. Forest
   Service, has led to a better understanding of the history of volcanism
   in the San Francisco Volcanic Field. This work is only part of the USGS
   Volcano Hazards Programs ongoing efforts to protect peoples lives and
   property in all of the volcanic regions of the United States, including
   the Pacific Northwest, eastern California, Wyoming, Alaska, and Hawaii.
