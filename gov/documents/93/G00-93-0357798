   pursue undergraduate degrees in the life sciences to support
   professions needed by the NIH.

   Who should apply to the UGSP?

   Students who can demonstrate a sincere interest in pursuing a career in
   biomedical, behavioral and social science health-related research.

   What is the scholarship amount?

   Scholarships are provided up to $20,000 per year, which must be used
   for tuition, educational expenses, such as books and lab fees, and
   qualified living expenses while attending college; initially the
   scholarship is awarded for one year, but may be renewable for up to
   four years.

   How many scholarships will be awarded for the 2002-2003 academic year?

   institution's Financial Aid Director shall certify that students
   qualify as EFN. Students certified as EFN are considered to be from
   disadvantaged backgrounds.

   What if I am not certified as Exceptional Financial Need (EFN), but am
   from a disadvantaged background?
