  Regional Analysis and Prediction Branch -- NOAA /ERL / FSL /FRD

   RUC-2 is now running operationally at the National Centers for
   Environmental Prediction (NCEP) as of 6 April 1998.

   The RAP Branch focuses on the development of the
     * Mesoscale Analysis and Prediction System (MAPS), a regional data
       assimilation and forecast system, and the
     * Rapid Update Cycle (RUC), the operational version of MAPS running
       at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).

   The key features of RUC2/MAPS include:
     * high-frequency (every 1 h) 3-d objective analyses over the
       contiguous United States
     * high-frequency short-range model forecasts (out to 12 h) in support
       of aviation and other mesoscale forecast users
     * currently assimilates data from
          + commercial aircraft (relayed primarily through ACARS -
            Aircraft Communications, Addressing, and Reporting System)
          + wind profilers (404 and boundary-layer 915 MHz)
          + rawinsondes
          + surface reporting stations (including some mesonet)
          + buoys
          + RASS (Radio Acoustic Sounding System) - experimental
          + VAD (velocity-azimuth display) winds from NWS WSR-88D radars
          + GOES total precipitable water estimates from Univ. of
            Wisconsin - CIMSS
            And at NCEP
          + SSM/I total precipitable water estimates
          + GOES high-density visible, IR, and water vapor cloud-top cloud
            drift winds
     * uses a hybrid isentropic-sigma vertical coordinate.

       forecasts of mixing ratios of cloud water, rain water, snow, ice,
       and graupel, and also a forecast of the number concentration of ice
       particles.

     * 60-km RUC description.
       A detailed description of the 60-km Rapid Update Cycle and the
       60-km/3-h version of MAPS from a September 1994 National Weather
       Service Technical Procedures Bulletin. Includes information and
       even some pictures on

     * Domain, including the hybrid-b isentropic-sigma vertical coordinate
     * Analysis, including data used and analysis variables
     * Forecast model, including numerics and physics
     * Output fields available

     Access to real-time RUC-2 grids from the OSO server at NCEP

     RUC/MAPS 40-km and 60-km domain information
   terrain elevation and latitude/longitude data is available for
   downloading in ASCII and NetCDF formats.

     Interpolation/transformation software to download -- FORTRAN code
     * Interpolate from RUC/MAPS hybrid-b levels/variables to isobaric
       levels/standard variables
     * Transform from hybrid-b variables (virtual potential temperature,
       condensation pressure) to temperature and water vapor mixing ratio
       at a single point. (RUC2 variables are much easier to work with.)
