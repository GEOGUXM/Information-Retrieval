Project Overview

   The USGS is cooperating with the Osage Nation, Department of Energy,
   and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to investigate the effects of
   hydrocarbons and produced water (brines) on soil and ground and surface
   water and the natural processes that may be mitigating effects of those
   products at two sites adjacent to Skiatook Lake in the southeastern
   part of the Osage Reservation in northeastern Oklahoma (fig. 1).

   The geologic and climatic setting of these two sites resembles that of
   much of the major southern mid-continent oil- and gas-producing area of
   the U.S. oil and gas production has occurred in this area for over one
   hundred years (fig. 2). The Osage Nation holds the mineral rights, the
   BIA has trust responsibility, and the Corps of Engineers owns the
   surface at these sites.

                                     map

   Reconnaissance examination of these two sites indicates that local
   effects include soil salinization with resultant destruction of soil
   textures and deep erosion; death of proximal vegetation, stress on
   peripheral vegetation; salinization of surface water and ground water;
   saturation of soils with crude oil of varying age, and weathering and
   dispersal of crude oil components and trace elements.

   The north site has been producing since 1917 but has had little
   activity for 60-70 years (BIA, unpublished lease records, 2000). It has
   had at least one major unremediated oil spill and substantial produced
   water releases prior to 1937, which killed the native oak forest.
   Weathered hydrocarbons from at least two generations of spills remain
   in old pits and depressions. The site has been partially revegetated by
   native and nonnative species. Seepage of salt water from a shallow
   sandstone aquifer continues and active salt scarring persists.

   The south site is actively producing and has ongoing hydrocarbon
   releases and salt scars that have recently been partly remediated by
   tilling and soil amendments. Flooding of the reservoir 15 years ago
   substantially altered the local hydrology at both sites and has
   provided a major new receptor for contaminants. The reservoir is a
   major source of drinking water for the neighboring communities and a
   major recreational fishery supporting six sport-fish species.
