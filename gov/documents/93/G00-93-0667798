                            Do You Have A Sponsor?

   Having a sponsor is very important while transferring between stations.
        Be sure you have a sponsor assigned to you before you depart!
     * A sponsor is normally assigned to you within 30 days of receiving
       your assignment (this does not apply on short-notice assignments).
     * If you do not have a sponsor assigned to you after 30 days of
       receiving your assignment rip from your orderly room (personnel
       office), you can send our AFTAC Sponsor Program Managers an
       e-mail.  See the link below.
     * Exception to the Rule Above:  If you have received a short-notice
       assignment--meaning you have to report to AFTAC within 30 to 60
       days after you received your assignment print-out--please send an
       e-mail now to the AFTAC Sponsor Program Managers.

          Click here to send an e-mail to AFTAC's Sponsor Managers

    Note: Please don't send an e-mail before the 30 day time-line.  This
                does not apply for short-notice assignments.
