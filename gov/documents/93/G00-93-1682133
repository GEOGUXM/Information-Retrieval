   TRANSPORTATION FUND
   for CLEAN AIR
     __________________________________________________________________

Program Goals

   The purpose of the Transportation Fund for Clean Air (TFCA) is to
   reduce air pollution from motor vehicles. The TFCA seeks to fund
   cost-effective transportation projects and programs to reduce motor
   vehicle travel and vehicle emissions, consistent with the 1988
   California Clean Air Act and the Bay Area Clean Air Plan.

Eligible Applicants

   Only public agencies are eligible for TFCA funding. This includes
   cities, counties, school districts, transit districts, regional, and
   state agencies.

Funding Process

   The TFCA is funded by a $4.00 per vehicle surcharge on motor vehicles
   registered in the Bay Area. The vehicle surcharge generates
   approximately $20 million per year in TFCA revenue. Forty percent of
   TFCA revenues are distributed through Bay Area counties; each county
   has a designated Program Manager. Sixty percent of TFCA funds (the TFCA
   Regional Funds) are allocated by the Air District through a competitive
   grant application process. Funding for natural gas and electric
   vehicles under 10,000 lbs. GVW is available through the Vehicle
   Incentive Program. Funding for electric vehicle charging stations is
   available under the "CHARGE!" program.

   Public agencies can apply for funding either directly from the Air
   District, or from the appropriate county Program Manager.
