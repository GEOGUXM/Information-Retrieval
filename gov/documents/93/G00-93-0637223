About ESS

   The Earth, its relationship to the Sun and Solar System, and the
   universe in its totality are the domain of the Earth and Space Sciences
   (ESS) Project. This effort employs advanced computers to further our
   understanding of and ability to predict the dynamically interacting
   physical, chemical, and biological processes that drive these systems.
   Goddard Space Flight Center serves as the lead center for the ESS
   Project and collaborates with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
