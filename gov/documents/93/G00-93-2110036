  Map thumbnail Huntington Botanical Gardens - Sensor Web 3
  Building on the successful deployment in 2000 of Sensor Web 2 at the
  Huntington Botanical Gardens, Sensor Web 3 represents a new milestone
  in this emerging technology. The individual sensor pods are more
  environmentally robust, consume significantly less power, and are more
  user flexible than their predecessors. Each pod measures light levels,
  air temperature and humidity, with optional measurements of soil
  temperature and soil moisture. In addition, battery levels for each pod
  can be monitored for diagnostic purposes.

  See a map [high-resolution, low-resolution] of the pods generated from
  GPS data.

  NEW!
  One of the improvements in the Sensor Web 3 system is the addition of
  an interface to view graphs of real-time Sensor Web data.

  technology, click here.
