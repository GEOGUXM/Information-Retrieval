                              MOUSE GENOTYPING
             at the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR)

   The Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) is an NIH-supported
   resource providing high-throughput genotyping services to research
   efforts that are attempting to identify genetic loci and allelic
   variants involved in human disease. Beginning with the July 1, 2000
   application submission deadline, the Center extended genotyping
   services to investigators conducting mapping studies with inbred
   strains of mice. Using DNA samples provided by the principal
   investigator, CIDR will carry out a 20 cM genome-wide scan using
   automated fluorescent technology to genotype microsatellite markers.
   All data will remain the property of the principal investigator and
   will be returned once the studies at CIDR are complete. A total of 55
   inbred strains have been typed. A list of the strains, along with
   allele sizes for ~300 markers, is available. Only mouse mapping
   projects requesting whole genome scans totaling at least 6,000
   genotypes (DNA sample x microsatellite marker) will be accepted.

   Recently, the CIDR Board of Governors voted to accept applications from
   investigators who want to use a marker-assisted breeding strategy to
   accelerate the production of congenic strains of mice, so-called "speed
   congenics." Projects that are accepted for genotyping by the Board of
   Governors can send in samples from backcross generations N2 and N3.
   Each set of samples will be genotyped with a set of ~80-100
   microsatellite markers spaced approximately every 20 cM across the
   mouse genome. The N3 generation will be typed with a set of markers
   interspersed between those used in the N2 generation. For each
   generation, the investigator should request a minimum of 6,000
   genotypes (DNA sample x microsatellite marker).

   Investigators whose mapping projects are supported by one of the twelve
   NIH Institutes participating in CIDR will receive free genotyping.
   Other investigators are eligible to use CIDR on a fee for service
   basis.

   Access to CIDR is open to all investigators on a competitive basis
   through peer review. For a more complete description of CIDR, visit our
   Web site at http://www.cidr.jhmi.edu/. If you would like additional
   information, contact Dr. Jerry Roberts, Scientific Review Administrator
   and Executive Director, CIDR Board of Governors, in the NHGRI Office of
   Scientific Review.

   The Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) is a centralized
   facility established to provide genotyping and statistical genetics
   services for investigators seeking to identify genes that contribute to
   human disease. CIDR concentrates primarily on multifactorial hereditary
   disease although linkage analysis of single gene disorders can also be
   accommodated. CIDR was established in 1996 as a joint effort by eight
   institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Three additional
   institutes joined the effort in 1999 and another institute joined in
   2000, bringing the total number of supporting institutes to twelve. The
   facility is supported through a $21 million federal contract (number
   N01-HG-65403) to The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) with Dr. David
   Valle of the JHU Institute of Genetic Medicine as Principal
   Investigator. Dr. Robert Nussbaum of the National Human Genome Research
   Institute (NHGRI) serves as the government Project Officer.
