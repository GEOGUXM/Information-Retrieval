   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                                    (202) 690-6343

                                STATEMENT BY
                       HHS SECRETARY TOMMY G. THOMPSON
     Regarding the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Amendments of 2001
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Promoting Safe and Stable Families Amendments of 2001, which
   President Bush signed into law today, takes an unprecedented step
   toward protecting our nation's most vulnerable children, strengthening
   families and promoting stronger, healthier marriages.

   The Promoting Safe and Stable Families program provides grants to
   states and Indian tribes to help vulnerable families stay together. The
   program supports services to build healthy marriages and improve
   parenting skills to prevent child abuse and neglect while also
   promoting timely family reunification when children must be separated
   from their parents for their own safety. When children cannot be safely
   reunited with their families, the program works with state child
   welfare agencies to remove barriers that stand in the way of adoptions
   into loving homes.

   The new law authorizes $67 million for one of the administration's
   priority programs - competitive grants for projects that mentor
   children of prisoners. More than 2 million children in America have a
   parent in prison. These children suffer from far more behavioral,
   health and educational problems than other children and are at
   increased risk of becoming criminals themselves. By enabling caring
   adults to serve as role models and positive influences to these at-risk
   children, we can build happier, healthier lives for them today and in
   years to come.

   Finally, the new law will expand HHS' Independent Living Program to
   extend benefits and services to young adults who have grown up in and
   aged out of foster care to give them the support they need to
   transition to adulthood and self-sufficiency. An additional $60 million
   of annual funding to states is authorized to fund educational and
   training vouchers for youths between the ages of 16 and 23 to help them
   acquire the knowledge they'll need to build careers of their own.

   Families have always been the cornerstone of American society. I
   commend Congress for passing the Promoting Safe and Stable Families
   Amendments of 2001, which will further improve the lives of vulnerable
   children and parents and help our nation as a whole.

   BACKGROUND INFORMATION

            PROMOTING SAFE AND STABLE FAMILIES AMENDMENTS OF 2001

   Overview: On January 17, 2002, President Bush signed into law H.R.
   2873, the "Promoting Safe and Stable Families Amendments of 2001,"
   implementing many of the administration's proposals to expand services
   to strengthen families, create and expand mentoring programs for
   children whose parents are in prison, and enhance educational
   opportunities for children leaving foster care.

   CURRENT LAW

   The Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) program provides grants
   to states and Indian tribes for family support, family preservation,
   family reunification, and adoption promotion and support services. The
   program is one of the few federally supported programs designed to help
   families to stay together, avoid removal of children from their homes,
   and support timely reunification where temporary removal has been
   necessary as long as these measures can be taken while ensuring
   children's safety. Available funding for the program in fiscal year
   2001 was $305 million. States are allocated funds remaining after
   set-asides for Indian tribes (currently 1 percent) and research and
   technical assistance (currently $6 million).

   The Court Improvement Program (CIP) provides grants to help state
   courts improve their handling of foster care and adoption proceedings.
   Fiscal year 2001 funding was $10 million. The Chafee Foster Care
   Independence Program offers assistance to help current and former
   foster care youths achieve self-sufficiency. Fiscal year 2001
   authorization for the Chafee program was $140 million.

   CHANGES MADE BY H.R. 2873

   Promoting Safe and Stable Families

     * The bill adds a findings statement to the PSSF legislation to
       indicate the need for family preservation, family support,
       time-limited reunification and adoption promotion and support
       programs. The bill amends the purpose statement to emphasize the
       importance of coordination of the four service programs.
     * H.R. 2873 amends the definition of family support services in the
       original PSSF legislation to include strengthening parental
       relationships and promoting healthy marriages. It also amends the
       definition of family preservation services to allow states to
       support infant safe haven programs. Although states could always
       use the funds for these services, the amendment clarifies the
       flexibility to do so.
     * The bill allows HHS to reallot unneeded portions of state
       allotments to other states, so that the total appropriation remains
       available for program purposes.
     * The bill requires the Secretary to give priority consideration to
       certain research areas and to provide technical assistance to
       states.
     * The amendments reauthorize mandatory funding of $305 million for
       fiscal year 2002 through 2006 with current set-asides. The bill
       also authorizes an additional discretionary funding of $200 million
       for PSSF for fiscal years 2002 through 2006.

   Court Improvement Program

     * The bill strengthens the statement of program purposes to 1)
       promote more timely court actions that provide for safety of
       children in foster care and expedite their placement in appropriate
       permanent settings, and 2) implement a child and family services
       review corrective action plan.
     * The amendments reauthorize mandatory funding at $10 million
       annually and authorize an additional 3.3 percent of any
       discretionary funding for the court improvement program.

   Mentoring Children of Prisoners

     * The bill adds a new program to provide federal grants to programs
       for mentoring children of prisoners. The number of children with
       parents in prison has grown substantially over the past decade,
       currently numbering more than 2 million children. As a group, these
       children have far more behavioral, health and educational problems
       than the population at large; their prospects are dimmer for a
       future as well-adjusted and productive adult members of society;
       and they are at an increased risk of becoming criminals themselves.
     * The program is authorized at $67 million for fiscal years 2002 and
       2003, and such sums that are necessary for fiscal years 2004
       through 2006. The bill reserves 2.5 percent of the funds for
       research, technical assistance and evaluation.
     * State and local governments, Indian tribes and consortia, and
       community and faith-based organizations can apply for grants of up
       to $5 million. Grantees will need to become gradually more
       self-sufficient through public-private partnerships. A grant for a
       program shall be available to pay a share of program costs equal to
       up to 75 percent in the first two fiscal years of program funding
       and up to 50 percent in the subsequent fiscal years.

   Educational and Training Vouchers
     * The bill adds provisions to the Chafee program to provide for state
       programs of education and training vouchers for youths who age out
       of foster care. The Independent Living Program enables states to
       extend a safety net of benefits and services to young adults who
       grew up in foster care and were never adopted to ease their
       transition to adulthood and self-sufficiency. Currently, too many
       of the 16,000 youths who annually age out of foster care are not
       able to pursue education or vocational training for want of
       sufficient resources.
     * The bill allows vouchers to be available to: 1) youth aged 18 to 21
       who have aged out of foster care; 2) youth adopted from foster care
       after attaining age 16; and 3) youth between 21 and age 23 who are
       enrolled in a full-time course of study and making satisfactory
       progress toward completion.
     * The bill authorizes $60 million annually for educational and
       training vouchers under the Chafee program. Vouchers for individual
       youths could total up to $5,000 annually and would be disregarded
       for purposes of determining eligibility and benefits under other
       federal or federally supported assistance programs.
