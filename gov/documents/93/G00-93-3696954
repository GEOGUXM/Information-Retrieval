                            General Instructions

   Welcome to the Legal Services Corporation's Applicant Information
   Network (AIN). This site was created to make it possible to submit
   grant application materials to LSC via the Internet.

   This site is designed to work with Netscape Navigator version 3.0 or
   higher. It will also work with version 4.0 or higher of Internet
   Explorer.

   You may print these instructions through your browser.

   The Applicant Information Network home page has a menu consisting of
   three items. These three items include these instructions, grant
   application materials, and a bulletin board. The grant application
   materials currently include a Notice of Intent to Compete and Forms A,
   B, C, D, E, F, G, and K of the LSC grant application package. The AIN
   bulletin board has sample copies of these forms, as well as
   instructions about how to complete them. Click here to access the
   sample forms and instructions.

   The LSC Notice of Intent to Compete and a few of the grant application
   forms consist of several connected pages. At the bottom of each page
   there are next and previous buttons to enable you to move to the next
   or previous page. Each page also has an exit button which will allow
   you to leave the form you are working on.

   Each page in these forms has fields that you need to fill out.  Some
   fields will already have information in them, such as a zero. Delete
   any information which appears in the field before entering information
   of your own.

   Then you can enter new information into the field. If there is an arrow
   on the side of the field, you can click the arrow and a list of options
   will appear. To select one of the options, simply click on the option
   you want. To go to the next field, press the tab key or move the mouse
   pointer to that field. Once you have filled in all the fields, go to
   the bottom of the page where there are buttons for saving, exiting, and
   moving to the next or previous page.

   Exiting a form does not automatically save it. If there is a save
   button in the page you are using, be sure to click on the save button
   before exiting. Forms that do not have a save button, but have either a
   next or previous button, will automatically save when you click on the
   next or previous button.

   Many forms have a submit button at the end of the form which tells the
   computer that you are finished with the form and wish to submit it to
   LSC. Once you submit a form, you can not go back and edit it without
   first asking LSC staff to un-submit that form.

   If you have any questions or comments, please e-mail us at
   ain@lsc.gov.  We have built this site to serve you. We welcome your
   comments and suggestions.

   Thank you

                         Legal Services Corporation
