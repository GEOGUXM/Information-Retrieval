   Clerk of Court

   UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT
   Western District of Texas


   The mission of the Clerk's Office is to provide the necessary
   operational and administrative support and structure to allow the court
   to carry out the judicial function effectively and efficiently in the
   Western District of Texas. To achieve this, the Clerk's Office is
   dedicated to rendering effective and courteous service to the judges,
   judicial staffs, the bar, the public, litigants, other courts, and
   related government agencies.
   Codes, rules, and procedures have been issued in an effort to provide
   fair treatment to all parties involved. Both debtors and creditors
   experience a loss during the process, and it is therefore important for
   matters to be handled with sensitivity and expediency. The impartial
   application of procedures helps to ensure fair treatment and provide
   balance between the interests of debtors and their creditors. It is our
   responsibility to accurately implement these procedures in order to
   create, maintain, and ensure an environment that is conducive to
   providing the debtor with a "fresh start".
   In support of this mission, the Clerk's Office provides services in the
   areas of administration and operations. In the other divisions, those
   functions not provided directly by headquarters are performed by the
   deputies-in-charge and their staffs.
