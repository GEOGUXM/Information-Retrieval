                       Religious Freedom Questionnaire
                                 [gray.gif]

   The following is a questionnaire regarding religious freedom and the
   Religious Freedom Amendment. If you'd like, please take a moment to
   complete the online questionnaire. We've also included a general
   comments section at the end of the survey for feedback you may have
   about the Religious Freedom Amendment. Thanks for your time.

     1. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court held the Ten Commandments could
     not be displayed at school. In 1985, it ruled a moment of silence at
     public school was unconstitutional, because it could be used by
     students for silent prayer. Do you agree or disagree that religious
     objects and voluntary student prayer should be removed from schools?
     (*) Agree
     ( ) Disagree

     2. In 1989, a courthouse nativity scene was ruled unconstitutional
     by the Supreme Court in Allegheny v. Pittsburgh ACLU because it was
     not "balanced" by secular objects. No known case requires that a
     Santa display be balanced by religious objects. Do you agree or
     disagree that religious objects on public property should be removed
     unless balanced by secular objects?
     (*) Agree
     ( ) Disagree

     3. In 1996, the 10th Circuit Court ruled in Robinson v. City of
     Edmond that Edmond, Oklahoma must remove a cross from among the
     several historical emblems on its city seal. An Alabama court has
     forbidden the display of the Ten Commandments in the courtroom.
     Currently, the ACLU is suing the State of Ohio for its state motto
     which says, "With God, all things are possible." Do you agree or
     disagree with these efforts to remove religious symbols and phrases
     from local and state items?
     (*) Agree
     ( ) Disagree

     4. The Ohio Court of Appeals stopped Cleveland's schools from
     providing 2,000 disadvantaged children with vouchers to permit
     parents to choose a better school for their child. The court said it
     was unconstitutional because parents might choose a parochial
     school. Do you agree or disagree that school vouchers which could be
     used for parochial schools are unconstitutional?
     (*) Agree
     ( ) Disagree

     5. In 1992, in Lee v. Weisman, a rabbi's nonsectarian prayer at a
     Rhode Island public school graduation was forbidden and declared
     unconstitutional because it was deemed "psychological coercion" to
     expect others to listen respectfully. Also, the ACLU is currently
     suing Nitro High School in West Virginia for its 17 year tradition
     of offering a prayer over the loudspeaker before football games. Do
     you agree or disagree that prayers should be forbidden at school
     events?
     (*) Agree
     ( ) Disagree

     6. Supporters of the Religious Freedom Amendment argue that recent
     court decisions have restricted religious expression. Prayer and
     religious speech are restricted when other speech is not. The
     Religious Freedom Amendment retains the First Amendment's safeguards
     against official religion, and keeps school prayer voluntary, but
     protects it just as other forms of free speech are protected. Do you
     agree or disagree that the Religious Freedom Amendment is needed?
     (*) Agree
     ( ) Disagree

     Thank you for taking the time to complete the survey.
