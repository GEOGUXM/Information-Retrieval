     [why.gif] Observation of prefontal low-level jets (LLJ) contained
     within extratropical cyclones are a key factor to improving cyclone
     forcasts and providing more accurate emergency warnings.

   Land falling cyclones cause extensive damage as they come ashore on the
   US west coast by producing more than 8 inches of rain in a 24 hour
   period accompanied by surface winds exceeding 50 m/s. The accurate
   forecast of these events needed to alert the public, military and
   emergency services are often off by as much as several hours and 300
   km. The need for improvements in this type of forecast is reflected in
   the objectives of the National Weather Service and the USWRP. These
   views are also supported by recommendations of operational weather
   forecasters from NOAA and the military.

   A key element of these severe storms is the prefrontal low-level jet
   (LLJ). This jet can cause extreme coastal rains when it encounters
   mountains and damaging coastal winds can be created by low-level
   blocking or mountain wave behavior. Operational forecasters have long
   used the LLJ's strength, position and moisture content to help predict
   precipitation rates and coastal winds. Significant errors in these key
   parameters occur due to the limited amount of data available offshore
   and aloft along the coast.

   Adjoint techniques have been used to identify limited regions where
   additional data and improved observation of the LLJ could help
   forecasts downstream. These approaches suggest that improved knowledge
   of the position and strength of the LLJ offshore, 0-18 hours before
   landfall could allow mesoscale numerical models to better predict the
   location and intensity of flooding rains and damaging winds.
   Predictions of the overall motion and development of the entire cyclone
   may also improve with the more accurate observation of the LLJ.
