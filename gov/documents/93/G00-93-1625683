                               To Submit a Paper

   Everyone who submits should read the following general information:
     * Title/Abstract preparation
     * Formats for text submission
     * Formats for figures
     * Read our response and check your submission
     * Replace your paper if necessary
     * Take responsibility

   Please note that we do not accept submissions with omitted figures,
   tables or sections. We also do not accept `abstract only' submissions.
   Such submissions are unhelpful to readers and of very limited archival
   value.

   Web upload is an easy and efficient method for submitting to the
   archive, and should be used except in cases of poor network connection
   or other technological difficulty:
     * Web upload help

   If you are unable to submit using Web upload, then you have these
   choices:
     * MIME e-mail with attachments.
     * FTP the submission to our incoming directory
       ftp://arXiv.org/incoming/ and send the abstract via e-mail.
     * E-mail the submission by packaging your files appropriately and
       e-mailing the package.

   The availability of new submissions is explained below, in the section
   on availability of submissions
   . Note further that all official versions of submitted papers are made
   publicly available. See the discussion of submission version
   availability.
     __________________________________________________________________

Formats for text of submission

   Your submission to the archive must be in one of the following formats:
     * TeX/LaTeX/AMSTeX/AMSLaTeX
     * HTML+PNG/GIF
     * PDF
     * PostScript
     * Mathematica Notebook (stand-alone or with TeX)

   Our goal is to store papers in formats which are highly portable and
   stable over time. Currently, the best choices are TeX/LaTeX or
   HTML+PNG/GIF, because these open formats do not hide information. (Note
   that for this and other reasons you should not submit dvi, PS, or PDF
   created from tex source.) Users of some word processors, such as
   Microsoft Word, can save their documents as PDF and this is a viable
   option for such users.

     * Considerations for TeX/LaTeX/AMSTeX/AMSLaTeX submissions
     * Considerations for HTML+PNG/GIF submissions
     * Considerations for PostScript submissions
     * Considerations for PDF submissions
     * Considerations for Mathematica Notebook submissions
     __________________________________________________________________

Formats for figures

   Figures for a submission can be in a number of common formats. These
   include:
     * PostScript (most common, for line drawings, plots, etc.)
     * JPEG (ideal for photographic images)
     * PNG (best for non-photographic images (bitmaps))
     * GIF (ok for non-photographic images, PNG is better)

   If figure files are too large, then readers with poor network
   connections will not be able to download them. Remember that the
   archive has many users with poor network connections (such as users in
   some developing nations). If your submission has a large figure, be
   sure to include it, but make all possible efforts to reduce its size.
   Note that we do not accept submissions with omitted figures, even if
   you provide a link to another server. See our information on submission
   sizes and our bitmapping help for more information. If you have
   problems with a large submission, contact us at www-admin@arXiv.org.

   If you submit PostScript figures with TeX source, use TeX macro
   packages so that the figures will appear in the document. If you are
   using latex2e you should use the standard graphics and graphicx
   packages. Unfortunately, archive administration cannot provide help
   with TeX-related issues, so seek help from your colleagues if
   necessary. If the figures are not PostScript or cannot be included in
   the document by TeX, you can send the figure files as part of your
   submission, and these figures will be made available to readers as
   extra files.

Read our response and check your submission

   After you submit your paper, you will receive a response from the
   archive. It is very important that you read this response. Be sure to
   check for errors in the copy of the abstract that appears in the
   message. The response to a successful submission will include a URL
   that will allow you to view the PostScript version generated here,
   together with a username/password for viewing it.

   If you see any errors or are unhappy with the formatting, then you
   should replace the paper to correct any problems. If you cannot correct
   any problems yourself, you should send email to us at
   www-admin@arXiv.org explaining the problem before 16:00 (US Eastern
   time, EDT/EST). Be sure to include the archive and paper number but do
   not send files/submissions to this address.

   Each day's submissions are not made available to the general public
   until 20:00 US Eastern time (EDT/EST) Sunday through Thursday. See the
   discussion of availability.
     __________________________________________________________________

Replace your paper if necessary

   If you replace before 16:00 US Eastern time (EDT/EST) Monday through
   Friday, the archive software will not generate an additional date
   stamp. Some authors find this desirable (check current local time at
   main site).

   We encourage authors to update and to make corrections in their papers.
   DO NOT make a new submission for a corrected paper or for an erratum.
   Rather replace the original submission.
     __________________________________________________________________

Take responsibility

   Because putting papers on the archives entails certain
   responsibilities, authors must make their own submissions. Third-party
   submissions (by secretaries for example) are often the ones that cause
   the most problems, presumably due to lack of self-interest and related
   factors.

   The following information is also required for submission:
     * Institutional affiliation for the author(s) must be provided.
     * Offical report number(s) from the author(s) institution(s) must be
       provided.

Availability of submissions

   All archives are on a daily availability schedule, with no activity
   scheduled on weekends (check current local time at main site).

   Example: A submission to hep-th on Monday before 16:00 (US Eastern
   time, EDT/EST) will be available after 20:00 (US Eastern time, EDT/EST)
   on that day and will appear in the Tuesday a.m. hep-th regular mailing.

   Example: A submission to hep-th on Friday before 16:00 (US Eastern
   time, EDT/EST) will be available after 20:00 (US Eastern time, EDT/EST)
   of the following Sunday and will appear in the Monday a.m. hep-th
   regular mailing.

   Example: A submission to hep-th on Friday after 16:00 (US Eastern time,
   EDT/EST) will be available after 20:00 (US Eastern time, EDT/EST) of
   the following Monday and will appear in the Tuesday a.m. hep-th regular
   mailing.
