   Development of Innovative Qualification Methods
   For newly available COTS and emerging technologies, the development of
   new, more efficient methods and techniques of qualifying devices and
   packages for reliable, radiation tolerant use in NASA space systems.
   The objective is to better accommodate qualification into the better,
   faster, cheaper paradigm so that rapid insertion of well-qualified
   parts and packages can take place.
