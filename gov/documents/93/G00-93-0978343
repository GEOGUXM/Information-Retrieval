              Why is it so hard to figure out what's going on?

    There is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers exactly
       what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly
        disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and
      inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has
                              already happened.
                                Douglas Adams

   The material that the Earth and the solar system are made of has been
   changed and rearranged during the billions of years since its creation,
   so measuring its complete composition, or makeup, is difficult. We have
   good evidence that the first elements to appear in the early universe
   were the lightest ones, hydrogen and helium. Most of the gas found
   between the stars in our Milky Way galaxy and in other galaxies
   throughout the universe as well are hydrogen and helium. We also know
   that the Sun is made chiefly of hydrogen and helium. We understand that
   stars, including our Sun, shine by the process of combining, or
   "burning", lighter elements into heavier ones, hydrogen into helium,
   and helium into carbon, and so on. In fact, in the outer layers of the
   Sun, we can see the light emitted by heavy elements like carbon,
   silicon, and iron. These elements were formed by earlier generations of
   stars.

   Earth Scientists have attempted to answer questions about where this
   matter came from and how it evolved in a variety of ways. Meteorites
   that have hit the Earth can be studied since, in some respects, they
   seem to be like the solar system when it formed. Another way to study
   the material is by going into space, above Earth's atmosphere, to study
   particles that come from the Sun. Early in this century, scientists
   learned that matter from space is bombarding the Earth. With the advent
   of space missions, we learned that it comes not only from the Sun, but
   also from the distant reaches of the Galaxy. It has been recently
   discovered that some of these particles come from the gas clouds
   outside our solar system.

   Science has barely scratched the surface in examining the actual source
   of the particles traveling through space around us. Knowledge of the
   many processes that created the current order is difficult to attain
   but rewarding. Theories are upheld or upset, and new theories take
   their place. As new information becomes available, from both spacecraft
   and Earth-based instruments, the picture becomes clearer.
