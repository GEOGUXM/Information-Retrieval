   General Information

   Lightning kills an average of 73 people per year in the United States.
   Many people do not act to protect their lives, their property, and the
   lives of others in a timely manner because they simply don't understand
   all the dangers associated with thunderstorms and lightning.

     The Science of Lightning

   At any given moment, there are 1,800 thunderstorms in progress
   somewhere on the earth. We know the cloud conditions necessary to
   produce lightning, but cannot forecast the location or time of the next
   stroke of lightning from a storm.

     Outdoor Safety

   Being out-of-doors is the most dangerous place to be during a lightning
   storm. If caught ourdoors in a thunderstorm go quickly inside a
   completely enclosed building. If that's not possible, get inside a
   hard-topped all-metal vehicle, move away from lightning rods (fences,
   golf clubs, open vehicles, etc), and at last resort avoid being the
   tallest object in an open area and crouch on the balls of your feet.

     Indoor Safety

   The best protection from lightning is a house or other substantial
   building. Lightning striking these structures follows metal conductors
   such as electrical wiring, plumbing, and telephone lines from the top
   of the structure to the ground leaving inhabitants unscathed. Stay away
   from phone lines, televisions, electrical outlets, and showers/baths
   until the storm has passed.
