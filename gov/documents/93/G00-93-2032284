   Child Booster Seats / Safety Seats


                    (Para leer en Español, oprima aqui)

   Give 'em a Boost!

   NEW LAW effective January 1, 2002

   Most kids 4 - 6 are riding at risk.

   Could yours be one of them?

   Adult seat belts
   can actually be DANGEROUS to a child!

   Booster seats lift the child up, making the safety belt fit CORRECTLY
   and COMFORTABLY.

   Belt sits low over the upper thighs, not riding up on the abdomen.

   Shoulder belt is snug across the center of the shoulder, not across the
   neck or face.

   Kids should be in car booster seats if they:
     * Are too big for child safety seats
     * Weight about 40 - 60 pounds

   The New Law Says...

   Children must be secured in an appropriate child passenger restraint
   (safety seat or booster seat) until they are at least 6 years old or
   weigh at least 60 pounds.

   Car booster seats must be used in conjunction with the vehicle's lap
   and shoulder belt. The booster seat raises the child so that the
   vehicle lap and shoulder belt can be positioned properly, and the
   child's knees can bend naturally.

   There are two common types of car booster seats to use depending on
   your car...


   high-back booster seat

   High-Back Booster Seat

   If your car's back seat is lower than your child's ears, use this high
   back booster seat to help protect your child's head and neck.


   Backless Booster Seat
   backless booster seat

   If your car's seat back is higher than your child's ears, you can use a
   backless booster seat.

   Remember: a booster seat needs to be used every time. The back seat is
   the safest place for all children to ride. Always secure an empty
   booster seat in place.

   For more information contact your local CHP office.
