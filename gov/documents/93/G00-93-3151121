   Welcome To The Manager's Site
      Visit the schoolhouse or check online learning solutions for full
      schedules of courses and workshops, or see the careers section for new
      opportunities in NASA project management. The events calendar will keep
      you informed of special events, both online and off-line. As project
      managers gain experience, the TeamMate online survey can help them
      evaluate completed projects and use feedback to grow as leaders.
      The tools and classes in this section, along with the resources in our
      Knowledge Sharing section, aim to make NASA project managers as
      appropriately skilled and as flexible as this constantly evolving
      industry demands. Even born leaders require training to remain in
      charge. Return to Mars: Fundamentals of Project Management
