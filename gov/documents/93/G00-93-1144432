   Potential offerors downloading solicitations from this website should
   periodically check the solicitation's menu page for amendments or other
   updates to the solicitation. This is especially true for vendors who do
   not request a hardcopy of the solicitation from the Department.
   Amendments to solicitations are automatically mailed only to those
   vendors who request a copy of the solicitation or who are on the
   Solicitation Mailing List for that particular procurement. Amendments
   are posted online as soon as possible after they are issued.
