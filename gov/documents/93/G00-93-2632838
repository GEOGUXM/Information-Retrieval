   In 1998, the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS),
    which serves as the public advisory body for the Secretary of Health
   and Human Services and Congress on national health information policy,
    created a Workgroup on the National Health Information Infrastructure
     (NHII). The Workgroup envisions the NHII as a set of technologies,
     standards, applications, systems, values, and laws that support all
    facets of individual health, health care, and public health. In June
     2000, the Workgroup released an interim report. The report will be
    finalized after a series of public hearings. Comments and suggestions
           about the report, the NHII, and this site are welcome.
