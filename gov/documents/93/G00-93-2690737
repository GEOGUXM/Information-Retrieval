   Important Notice concerning use of PERB Forms


    PDF Icon Adobe Acrobat Reader is required to view and print pdf files.

     PERB forms are now "interactive", which means that the user may
     complete the form on his/her computer screen before printing the
     form. You can navigate from field to field using your mouse or the
     "Tab" key on your keyboard. (Do not use the"Enter" key to complete
     an entry. Instead, tab to the next text field or use your mouse to
     move the next field in which you need to enter information.)

     While petitions and unfair practice charges can not be filed
     on-line, we hope that you will find this new functionality to be of
     assistance. Users may still print the form first and complete it
     manually.
