   What's the purpose of this site?
   This site is designed to provide current and accurate information on
   how to make health-related information Web sites and other user
   interfaces more usable, accessible, and useful. The site also links to
   a variety of quality Web sites and resources on usability,
   accessibility, and related topics that exist in the field. (See our
   Linking Policy.)

   Why is the National Cancer Institute providing this resource?
   Clear and effective online communication to patients, health
   professionals and researchers is a critical element in the overall
   communications strategy of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the
   federal government's principal agency for cancer research. Because NCI
   designs and manages a significant number of cancer-related information
   Web sites, this site was developed to specifically assist NCI Web
   managers, designers, and authors improve their overall communications
   and design efforts. However, since the general principles of good
   design and usability are applicable to anyone who works with
   information Web sites, we decided to make the site available to other
   federal agencies and to the general public.

   What other communications activities does NCI support?

   NCI has identified cancer communications as a priority. A primary goal
   is to increase knowledge about, tools for, access to, and use of cancer
   communications by the public, consumers, patients, survivors, and
   health professionals  with a special focus on diverse populations  to
   accelerate reductions in the U.S. cancer burden.

   Usability.gov is one of many communications activities at NCI:

   Does Usability.gov have a linking policy?

   Usability.gov uses the following guidelines for linking to non-NCI Web

       enhances the information on Usability.gov;
     * Provides credible, accurate and current information, is subject to
       adequate procedures for the review and updating of material;
     * Makes reasonable accommodations for users with disabilities, such
       as the visually impaired;
     * Primarily focuses on information or educational content, rather
       than the promotion of a product or service; and
     * Adheres to adequate policies regarding external links and privacy
       of user data.

   These criteria may change to reflect new Web policies at NCI.

   The National Cancer Institute (NCI) respects the privacy of visitors to
   the Usability.gov Web site.

   Why is information collected? We may collect a limited amount of
   information on usage of the Web site for statistical purposes, in order
   to measure the number of visitors to the various sections of our site
   and to help us make our site more useful to visitors.

   standard server log information, such as the domain name or IP address
   from which you access the Internet, the date and time you access our
   site, the pages you viewed, the type of browser and operating system
