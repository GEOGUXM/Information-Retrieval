            NEA Announces Funding for New Public Works Initiative

   The National Endowment for the Arts New Public Works Initiative is
   intended to develop the highest quality of design in the public realm
   through the sponsorship of national design competitions. It is targeted
   to the disciplines of architecture, landscape architecture, urban
   planning, and industrial design. The multi-year New Public Works
   initiative will emphasize school design in its next round, to stimulate
   greater public awareness of the important role design can play in
   education. The program will be expanded to award up to $1.25 million
   for as many as 20 projects in 2002. New Public Works will provide up to
   $75,000 each to as many as 10 school design projects, in addition to 10
   general projects that will receive up to $50,000 each. The deadline for
   letters of interest is January 11, 2002.
