                         Bureau of Vital Statistics

   The task of recording all the births, deaths, marriages and divorces in
   Texas belongs to the Bureau of Vital Statistics. Each year, almost
   750,000 documents are registered, and the public requests more than
   200,000 searches for documents such as birth certificates needed by
   children to enter school or for adults to prove citizenship. In
   addition, the Bureau develops, analyzes and disseminates information
   used to plan and evaluate public health programs and to identify
   specific problem areas, such as infant mortality, teen pregnancy or
   tobacco use.
