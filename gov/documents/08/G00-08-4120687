   The William J. Campbell Library of the U.S. Courts, located in the
   Everett McKinley Dirksen Federal Building in Chicago, Illinois, is the
   headquarters library of the United States Court of Appeals for the
   Seventh Circuit.

   Court libraries in the federal judiciary are established and funded to
   meet the information needs of judges, support staff and other court
   personnel. The headquarters library is joined by branch libraries in
   East St. Louis and Springfield, Illinois, Indianapolis and South Bend,
   Indiana and Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin as it provides reference
   and information resources to all of the federal judges in Illinois,
   Indiana and Wisconsin, including the Circuit, District, Magistrate and
   Bankruptcy judges and their staffs. We also serve the District and
   Bankruptcy Clerks of Court and their staffs as well as the Probation
   and Pretrial officers in the three states of the Seventh Circuit.
