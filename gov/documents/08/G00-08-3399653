   Recent News Item CSB's FAIR Act Submission
   (Washington, DC October 10, 2001): The FAIR Act directs Federal
   agencies to issue each year an inventory of all commercial activities
   performed by Federal employees, e.g., those activities that are not
   inherently governmental. OMB is to review each agency's Commercial
   Activities Inventory and consult with the agency regarding its content.

   Upon the completion of this review and consultation, the agency must
   transmit a copy of the inventory to Congress and make it available to
   the public.

   In accordance with the FAIR Act, the Chemical Safety Board has posted
   its current FAIR Act submission here on the CSB website.

   Recent News Item Chemical Safety Board and the Treasury Bureau of
   Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Sign Memorandum of Understanding
   WASHINGTON DC - July 2 --- The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation
   Board (CSB) and the Treasury Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
   (ATF) have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that will
   enable both agencies to contribute to the overall enhancement of
   chemical safety and prevention. Under the MOU, the ATF and CSB will
   coordinate incident notification, data and information exchange,
   training, technical and professional assistance and related activities
   to promote the safety, health, and well-being of the nation's workers
   and the public.

   The MOU sets forth 10 principles of coordination between the two
   agencies. ATF enforces and investigates laws concerning arson and
   explosives. The ATF is a law enforcement organization within the United
   States Department of Treasury with unique responsibilities dedicated to
   reducing violent crime, collecting revenue, and protecting the public.

   The CSB, an independent agency, was created by Congress to contribute
   to and improve chemical safety by conducting incident investigations,
   determining all possible causes and producing high-quality reports and
   special studies. From the results of investigations and studies, the
   CSB adopts recommendations to prevent future incidents, submitting them
   as appropriate to agencies, organizations, companies and other bodies.
   The CSB vigorously advocates action in support of its recommendations
   by working with recipients and through other means.

   The MOU is available to view or download from the CSB website's
   Library.

   Recent News Item CSB Safety Bulletin Says Managing Change Is Essential
   to Safe Chemical Process Operations

   (Washington, DC August 28, 2001): In industry, as elsewhere, change
   often brings progress. But it can also increase risks that, if not
   properly managed, create conditions that may lead to injuries, property
   damage or even death.

   A new Safety Bulletin from the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard
   Investigation Board (CSB) released today concerning Management of
   Change (No. 2001-04-SB, August 2001) discusses two incidents (one in
   Maryland and the other in Washington State) that occurred in the United
   States in 1998. The first incident involved a November 25th fire at an
   Equilon Enterprises oil refinery in Anacortes, Washington. The fire in
   the delayed coking unit caused six fatalities. The second incident on
   October 13th involved a reactor vessel explosion and fire at the CONDEA
   Vista Company detergent alkylate plant in Baltimore, Maryland that
   injured four people and caused extensive damage.
