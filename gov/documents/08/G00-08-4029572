               IMPORTANT NOTICE from the PACER Administrator:

   The United States District Court for the District of South Dakota has
   decided to eliminate electronic access to court records in all CRIMINAL
   CASES.
   The U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota currently
   provides federal civil court case information on the Internet.
   DIAL-UP access to Pacer will be discontinued effective January 1, 2002.
   When you access PACER on the Internet you will be required to use a
   login and password issued by the PACER Service Center. If you do not
   already have a PACER account, you may register online at
   http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov. It takes about a week to receive a login
   and password from the PACER Service Center.
   There is a $.07 per page charge for downloading case information on
   this system.
   The Judiciary is always open for suggestions from our electronic public
   access users for improvements. If you have comments or questions,
   contact the PACER Service Center by phone at (800) 676-6856 or (210)
   301-6440, or by email at pacer@psc.uscourts.gov. If you send email,
   please include the name of the specific court you are referring to.
