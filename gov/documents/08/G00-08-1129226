                                 Introduction
     This Internet site provides support materials describing the
     Secretary of State's Electronic Filing Proof of Concept program.
     This program will allow statewide and legislative candidates to file
     campaign finance statements electronically for the first time in
     California's history.

     Anyone wishing to file electronically will be required to use
     software which has been successfully tested for compatibility with
     the standard file format well in advance of the 1998 General
     Election. Testing will be performed through submission of a sample
     file to this Test Server via the Internet.

     This voluntary program will be an important opportunity for
     candidates, software providers, and the public to gain valuable
     insight into the future of campaign finance disclosure. We
     appreciate your interest in this program and look forward to any
     comments you may have.
