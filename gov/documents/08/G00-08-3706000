   State Administrative Manual

   The State Administrative Manual (SAM) is a reference source for
   statewide policies, procedures, regulations and information developed
   and issued by authoring agencies such as the Governor's Office,
   Department of General Services (DGS), Department of Finance (DOF),
   Department of Information Technology and Department of Personnel
   Administration. In order to provide a uniform approach to statewide
   management policy, the contents have the approval of and are published
   by the authority of the DOF Director and the DGS Director.
