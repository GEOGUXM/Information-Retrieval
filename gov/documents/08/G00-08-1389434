   Welcome to the Dietary Assessment Calibration/Validation (DACV)
   Register, a register of calibration/validation studies and
   publications. The register contains studies and publications which
   compare dietary intake estimates from two or more dietary assessment
   methods. Dietary assessment methods include:

        * Food records or diaries (including weighed intakes)
        * Dietary recalls
        * Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ's)
        * Dietary histories
        * Observed intakes
        * Chemical analyses of duplicate collections of foods consumed
        * Biological assessments (e.g. doubly-labelled water, plasma
          carotene, etc.)

   Before studies and publications are added to the database, each one is
   reviewed. The following is a list of studies that are not included in
   the register:
     * Food composition studies
     * Studies which assess only household and not individual food
       consumption
     * Reliability studies (studies which administer the same method at
       multiple times)

   The following is a list of publications that are not included in the
   register:
     * Abstracts submitted to conferences
     * Publications that only review or comment on other work

   The history of this effort dates back to 1993 when the idea for
   creating such a register was suggested at the First International
   Conference on Dietary Assessment in Minneapolis, MN.

   If you would like to view the details of one or more studies in the
   register, then do a study search. (Maintenance of the studies part of
   this database is difficult, and therefore we are considering
   discontinuing this part of the database. Please cast your vote in the
   user poll to indicate how useful this part of the database is to you.)

   If you would like to view the abstracts of one or more publications in
   the register, then do a publication search. If you have a study or
   publication which you think should be included in the register, then
   add it to the database.

   Development and maintenance of this site is a collaborative effort
   between the Division of Cancer Prevention and the Division of Cancer
   Control and Population Sciences of the National Cancer Institute. It
   has been developed as a means of keeping the international nutrition
   and health community aware of calibration/validation studies on dietary
   assessment methods being conducted worldwide.
