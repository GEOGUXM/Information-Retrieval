                  The NOAA CoastWatch Active Access System
     __________________________________________________________________

   Since 1987, in conjunction with other NOAA Line and Program Offices ,
   NOAA's CoastWatch Program has made satellite data products and in-situ
   data from NOAA environmental buoys available to Federal, state, and
   local marine scientists, coastal resource managers and the general
   public. Users are required to register with one or more of the
   CoastWatch Regional Nodes to receive FREE access to near-real time SST
   products.

   Products from other environmental satellites are being considered by
   NOAA for inclusion in the CoastWatch data stream. Where appropriate
   ocean color products, surface wind fields from scatterometers, surface
   topography from synthetic aperture radars and altimeters will be made
   available to users in U.S. coastal areas.

   NOAA's Office of Research and Applications (ORA) has responsibility for
   CoastWatch Program Management in cooperation with the National
   Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS)

   The SAA is participating in this NOAA-wide effort through the operation
   of the NOAA CoastWatch Active Access System (NCAAS). NCAAS handles the
   archival and distribution tasks of CoastWatch AVHRR products and
   provides on-line access to AVHRR products following their
   near-real-time release by NOAA NESDIS and NMFS collection and
   processing sites.
