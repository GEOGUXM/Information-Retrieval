   The Laboratory of High Energy Astrophysics (LHEA) is recognized world
   wide as a center of excellence and leadership in cosmic ray, X-ray and
   gamma ray astrophysics. With the recent addition of a Gravitational
   Wave Astrophysics group, the LHEA is now ready to support the
   development of the LISA mission. LHEA scientists working with GSFC
   engineers and technicians have pioneered state of the art
   instrumentation that has lead to many breakthrough discoveries. The
   development of successful partnerships with the University community,
   other government labs and international institutions has been a vital
   part of this success.

   The LHEA astrophysicists study a wide range of exotic phenomenon
   including black holes, neutron stars and white dwarfs, supernova
   remnants, gamma ray bursts, coronae of nearby stars, and the large
   scale structure of the Universe. The LHEA also provides a substantial
   service role to support the community in science operations and data
   analysis. This includes promoting and helping the community use of the
   data from missions associated with the labs programs. This includes the
   High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center ( HEASARC)
   which is responsible for archiving data from NASA's X-ray and Gamma ray
   astronomy missions.

   LHEA is one of three laboratories within the Space Science Directorate
   at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. An important function of the
   Directorate is to provide project scientist support, to ensure the
   science that Goddard's Space Science Missions achieve their science
   goals. The fact that the LHEA scientists are active scientists makes
   them well qualified to be project scientists and also to provide
   leadership in the development of new facilities for the future.

   The LHEA has a very successful education and outreach program, with
   many different types of material available including the very popular
   "Astronomy Picture of the Day" and "Imagine the Universe" Web sites.
   Teachers and members of the general public are recommended to go to the
   Education and Public Outreach area to find out more about high energy
   astrophysics.
