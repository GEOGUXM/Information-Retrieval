   The GSA Fleet Drive Thru is comprised of Mileage Express and Reports
       Carry Out. Mileage Express is a revolutionary way for our customers
       to report their mileages through our on-line computer application.

       inventories on the Internet whenever the need arises.

   FEDS - Federal Disposal System
   The Federal Disposal System (FEDS) is a GSA System used for recording,
       tracking and controlling the nationwide inventory of excess and
       surplus property of the Federal Government. Using FEDS you can
       report property for excess screening and to compete for property.
       Once the property is reported, prospective users of the property
       can use FEDS to compete for it. Log on to this web site for further
       information.

   Dial-a-Mile System
   This system enables you to update the mileages for your vehicle over
       the phone. Please call 1-877-472-3773.
