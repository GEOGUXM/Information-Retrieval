                          Mathematics Department at LBNL

          [banner7.jpg] The LBNL Mathematics Department, which is in the
      Computing Sciences Directorate of LBNL, consists of researchers on the
       faculty of the Mathematics Department at the University of California
           at Berkeley, staff scientists, postdoctoral fellows, visiting
      scientists, and graduate students. The Department's research centers on
           the development of numerical and analytical methods and their
           application to challenging, difficult problems in physics and
         engineering. Current areas of specialized interest are vortex and
       particle methods, solid mechanics and fracture, interface techniques,
            turbulence theory, dynamics of polymeric systems, parallel
      implementation of codes for large-scale scientific computing, and fast
          algorithms. For more details, please follow the links below to
                    Department members' individual home pages.
