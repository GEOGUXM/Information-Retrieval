     The Health Economics Resource Center is a national center that
     assists VA researchers in assessing the cost-effectiveness of
     medical care, evaluating the efficiency of VA programs and
     providers, and conducting high-quality health economics research.

     Since VA does not routinely prepare patient bills, VA researchers
     and analysts must rely on other sources to calculate the health care
     encounter costs. Three alternatives are available: average costing,
     micro-cost methods, and the Decision Support System.

     HERC is pleased to announce the release of a series of files with
     estimates of the cost of every VA outpatient encounter. Click here
     for more information on HERC's Outpatient Average Cost files.

     HERC is a resource center where you can learn about research
     guidelines, find an expert, enroll in our training sessions, review
     our training materials on health economics research, and view HERC
     publications.
