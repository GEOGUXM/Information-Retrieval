         The NASA EMPLOYEES BENEFIT ASSOCIATION (NEBA) is an employee operated
         association established in 1952 that exists for the sole purpose of
         providing low cost, high quality life insurance for you, the NASA
         employee or military detailee. Since NEBA is a not-for-profit
         organization which is self-funded and is controlled by your fellow NASA
         employees, you receive the maximum amount of coverage for your premium
         dollar.

         NEBA, which pre-dates the Federal governmentÂ’s own Federal Employees
         Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) program, has almost 7000 NASA employees
         currently enrolled.  Each year NEBA pays almost $1.5 million dollars to
         the beneficiaries of NASA employees.

         Alta Health currently administers "basic" group life insurance policies
         underwritten and funded by NEBA. NEBA "optional" insurance is
         underwritten and administered by Alta Health.
