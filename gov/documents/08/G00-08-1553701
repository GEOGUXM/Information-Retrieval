   Interplanetary Physics Branch, Code 692

                    News

   1 September 2001: Walter Allen joins 692 as Howard U. Cooperative
   Education Student
   Walter Allen joined the Interplanetary Physics Branch as a graduate
   level cooperative education Physics student at Howard University,
   effective in early May this year. He has been working in Rm.118 full
   time this summer. He was previously a summer student with 692 during
   1999, and since then a coop student with code 554, the laser and
   electronic optics branch. Walters interests are in computational
   physics, leading him to move to 692 this year.

   31 August 2001: First IMAGE-ing of Particle Acceleration by Dynamic
   Magnetic Fields
   The HENA instrument on the IMAGE mission has enough sensitivity to
   energetic neutral atoms to see the plasma sheet out to 12 RE on the
   nightside, just before a substorm dipolarization occurs. When the
   impulsive auroral brightening and injection of energetic particles
   occurs, IMAGE/HENA clearly sees the plasma sheet contract toward the
   Earth, and brighten in energetic particle flux. This behavior is
   consistent with the results of modeling the dipolarization of the
   magnetotail, with attendant induction electric fields, as obtained by
   Fok et al. in the July 1999 J. of Geophysical Research.

   15 June 2001: Magnetospheric Constellation Mission STDT Report Released
   A report on the Magnetospheric Constellation: Dynamic Response and
   Coupling Observatory (DRACO) has been in preparation for the past two
   years, and is now complete and available online. Either hard copy or
   electronic versions can be requested at the link above. The hard copy
   version comes with a short introductory movie on CD-ROM, and an
   animated card that illustrates one possible form of magnetotail
   dynamics that requires a constellation approach for definitive study. A
   much more revealing movie of this simulated magnetotail behavior can be
   downloaded from the report site. MC-DRACO is an approved mission of the
   Solar Terrestrial Probes Program of the NASA Sun Earth Connections
   Theme, and has been studied and defined by a NASA-appointed Science and
   Technology Definition Team, as identified in the report.

   14 May 2001: GGS Accomplishments and Future Directions Detailed for
   NASA Senior Review
   Dr. Barbara Giles coordinated the development of the GGS proposal to
   the NASA Senior Review of Sun Earth Connections operating missions, in
   cooperation with the entire GGS project science staff. The proposal,
   submitted to NASA headquarters on 14 May, summarizes the many
   accomplishments to date that have been realized using the new global
   data sets including the Geotail, Wind, and Polar spacecrafts. These
   data sets complement the others of the ISTP program, and the efforts of
   the GGS Theory and Ground-based Investigations. The proposal then
   outlines the new opportunities that will be afforded by extended
   mission operations, in part enabled by new orbital configurations,
   permitting GGS to appear as the right thing, in the right place, at the
   right time, for studies of the period of decreasing solar activity
   between now and 2005.

   27 March 2001: New Views of Magnetic Fields in the Heliosphere
   Recent theoretical work using 3D MHD simulations has discovered a new
   feature of the classical Parker spiral magnetic field in the
   heliosphere. Owing to secondary plasma flows (non-radial), the
   boundaries between sectors of toward and away fields (relative to the
   sun) are linked in these simulations by connecting field lines that
   deviate from the overall spiral shape. This previously unexpected and
   unnoticed linkage has been found in data comparisons based on the
   Helios spacecraft, which traveled as close as 40% (?) of the Earths
   distance from the sun. In addition to confirming the maturity of the
   theoretical simulations used in this work, this result has implications
   for the transport of harmful energetic particles from solar flares to
   the Earth, during space storm periods.
