   lady with idea light bulb above her head The TASC waiver request
   process is designed around the principles of the DOT Waiver Framework,
   which was announced by Secretary Slater on October 8, 1998.  It
   provides all DOT employees, as customers of TASC,  with the opportunity
   to share ideas about how TASC can improve the way it delivers its
   products and services while at the same time, making the systems TASC
   uses in delivering its products and services as flexible,
   cost-effective, and efficient as possible.

   TASC´s policy is to promote the approval of all waiver requests.  If
   you have a new or a better idea about how TASC can provide its products
   and services,  this process provides you with a mechanism to ask TASC
   to approve the waiver of TASC´s normal way of doing something and do it
   your way!
