                   Miller on Bush Address: 'He Nailed It'

   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Zell Miller (D-GA) issued the following
   statement tonight following the President's State of the Union address:

   "I think he nailed it. It's jobs and national security - national
   security and jobs.

   "Yes, I'm for his tax cuts. They would create more investment and more
   investments would create more jobs. And that's what's needed now.

   "I'm pleased that during this time of tight resources, he still found
   the money for a prescription drug benefit for low-income Americans.

   "I hope and pray that we can all come together and do these things in a
   bipartisan way.

   "I can tell you right now that's what the people want and this
   president understands that."

                    Miller: Finish Farm Bill Immediately
          Farmers, Bankers Anxiously Awaiting Action from Congress

   WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Zell Miller (D-GA) today called on the Senate
   to finish the debate and pass a new Farm Bill as soon as possible. The
   House has passed a Farm Bill; the Senate debated its version of the
   bill in December, but failed to pass it before adjournment.

   The following is Senator Miller's statement that was entered into the
   Congressional Record today:

   "Our farmers are hurting, and they are facing an uncertain future. They
   desperately need the stability this Farm Bill will offer them.

   "Because we failed to act in December, many bankers are balking at
   issuing loans to farmers. The bankers want a guarantee that there will
   be a new Farm Bill this season, or - at the very least - a disaster
   relief package.
