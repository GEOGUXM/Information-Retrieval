    The Cooperative Education Program at Johnson Space Center is open to
      graduate and undergraduate students from around the country. As a
    Co-op, you regularly alternate semesters at school with semesters at
     JSC working in a paid, full-time position directly related to your
       field of study. This supplements what you learned at school and
     provides the opportunity to gain valuable real-world experience you
                          won't get in a classroom.

   "The opportunity to be a part of the 'real' world before graduation and
   compare the advantages and disadvantages of one's career is especially
      helpful for those who have doubts about their future and want to
                     critically evaluate their options."
