   The National Weather Service (NWS) Upper-air Observations Program is
   managed by the Observing Systems Branch (OSB), which is part of NWS
   Headquarters located in Silver Spring, Maryland.  Upper-air Program
   staff oversee the operation of 92 Radiosonde stations in North America
   and the Pacific islands. It also supports the operation of 10 stations
   in the Caribbean.  Radiosondes provide upper-air data that are
   essential for weather forecasts and research. OSB staff are involved in
   the development and implementation of a new radiosonde ground system
   that will replace the obsolete systems currently in use. The OSB is
   also involved in the implementation of new observing systems such as
   wind profilers and commercial aircraft observations.
