   AWMA
   Welcome to the Golden West Section of the Air and Waste Management
   Association.

   The Air & Waste Management Association is the educational and technical
   organization for professionals concerned with the issues of air
   pollution control and waste management. The Association began in 1907
   and is now an organization of 13,000 members who are engineers,
   scientists, government officials, industrial personnel, control
   equipment and instrument manufacturers, and academicians.

    The Golden West Section was formed in June 1984. The Section serves
   northern California from Bakersfield north. Its purpose is to promote
   better understanding of the problems of air pollution and waste
   management within the geographic area of the Section and to provide a
   means of exchanging information directed towards solving those
   problems. To accomplish these goals, the Section presents a series of
   dinner meetings, workshops, and technical conferences. Additionally,
   the Sections scholarship program provides financial assistance to
   graduate or undergraduate students in the environmental field.
