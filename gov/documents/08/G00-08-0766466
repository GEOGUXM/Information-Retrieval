     FrogWeb: Amphibian Declines & Deformities

   tadpole morphing into frog
     * The continental United States is home to at least 230 amphibian
       species: 90 frog and toad species, and 140 species of salamanders.
     * In the U.S., declines are particularly serious in California, the
       Rocky Mountains, the Southwest, and Puerto Rico. Worldwide, decline
       "hot spots" also include Australia and Central America.
     * Amphibian deformities - extra limbs, malformed or missing limbs,
       and facial malformations - have been documented in 44 states, and
       involve nearly 60 species. In some local populations, up to 60% of
       the amphibians exhibit deformities.

   Deformed Amphibian Research at Hartwick College offers two approaches
   to learning about current findings: scroll through background
   information and recent discoveries in a narrative form, or become a
   "researcher" and employ the scientific method to explore findings and
   reach your own conclusions. Either way, you're sure to get a good
     overview of the issues from this site.
