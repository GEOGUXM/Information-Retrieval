   Global Approaches to Infrastructure Assurance (GAIA) is a unique and
   highly effective approach to analyzing critical infrastructures. A
   foreign infrastructure is critical if its management has the potential
   to significantly impact the interests of the U.S. GAIA is being
   developed by Sandia National Laboratories as part of an ongoing effort
   to improve our understanding of infrastructures throughout the world in
   order to promote economic and political stability in regions important
   to the U.S. The GAIA effort is based on the premise that complex
   infrastructure systems, such as those supplying water, agricultural
   commodities, and energy, constitute the foundation of economic, social,
   and political systems. Understanding the global dynamics of these
   integrated systems, including their environmental impacts, is becoming
   more important for making intelligent management decisions as we move
   into the twenty-first Century and the increasingly integrated world
   economy.

   GAIA is being designed to provide assistance to decision makers who
   deal with complex issues involving the management of critical
   infrastructures by providing them with timely worldwide access to
   relevant information, expertise, and technology. GAIA is directed
   toward the development and deployment of state-of-the-art decision
   support systems that provide:
     * a context set by key stakeholders,
     * a collaborative environment,
     * enhanced value of information, and
     * improved decision making in the management of critical
       infrastructures.

   A GAIA decision support system consists of the following three
   components:
    1. The Vital Issues Process - a strategic planning tool developed by
       Sandia National Laboratories that involves a multistage series of
       day-long workshops for identifying and prioritizing a
       stakeholder-defined portfolio of strategic issues, programmatic
       areas, or responses to specified problem. The Vital Issues process
       provides a format for identifying the information needed to
       properly address issues considered vital to managing critical
       infrastructures. It can also be used to develop portfolios of
       appropriate policy options and to allocate critical resources.
    2. The Silicon Computer - a suite of computer modeling tools that can
       be used to provide valuable analytical results relevant to the
       topic of interest. To review an example of the use of the "silicon
       computer" in the dynamic simulation of critical infrastructures, go
       to the Decision Support Systems section of the China Infrastructure
       Initiative.
    3. The Protein Computer - on-line, well recognized and respected
       professionals accessible through e-mail and real-time internet chat
       rooms.

   The Vital Issues process provides the context for identifying
   information needs for a decision support system (DSS). The "protein"
   and "silicon" computers are important components of the DSS in that
   they are needed to transform data into information and subsequently
   information into knowledge and knowledge into wisdom.

   Initial projects have shown the GAIA approach to be effective in
   addressing complex infrastructure issues in Africa, the Caribbean,
   Central America, Central Europe, Asia, and South America, as well as
   the United States. The results of several of these projects are
   presented in these pages.
