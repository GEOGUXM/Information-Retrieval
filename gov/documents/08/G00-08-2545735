   Welcome!

      The Hydrology Technical Group is part of the Environmental Technology
      Division of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), located
      in Richland, Washington (see locator map). PNNL is operated for the
      U.S. Department of Energy by Battelle.

      Our research activities cover a broad range of water resource issues:
        * We assess the impacts of climate change, hydropower, and irrigation
          on watershed health.
        * We measure and predict the quantity of precipitation that
          infiltrates the soil surface and eventually recharges the aquifer.
        * We measure and predict the movement of fluids, gases, and
          contaminants through the soil and vadose zone above the water
          table.
        * We measure and predict the movement of groundwater and the
          transport of contaminants to streams and rivers, as well as to and
          from wells used for irrigation or remediation activities.
        * We analyze complex problems involving the impacts of seasonal water
          availability, temperature, suspended sediment, and dissolved gases
          in rivers systems, especially the impacts of dams and their
          operation.

      Our solutions to problems can range from the simple (and quick!) to the
      sophisticated. Which solution we use will depend on your problem as
      well as your needs and resources.
