   Distressed Communities if it proposes to carry out Development and
   Service Activities. All applicants are required to obtain a Distressed

     Under the NMTC Program, an organization that has been certified as
   Community Development Entity (CDE) may apply to the CDFI Fund for an
   allocation of tax credits, which it can offer to its taxable investors
   to cover a portion of their equity investments into the CDE. To be
   certified as a CDE, an organization must, among other things,
   demonstrate that it is accountable to residents of eligible Low Income
   Communities in its service area. CDEs that receive allocations of tax
   credits will be required to demonstrate that the proceeds from tax
   credit transactions are used to support businesses operating in
   eligible Low-Income Communities. A CDE may obtain data and map(s) via
   this website to assist in identifying qualifying Low-Income Communities
   in its service area.
