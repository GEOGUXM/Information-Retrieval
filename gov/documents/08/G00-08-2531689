           The Lab...

   The Milford Laboratory, established in 1931, is located on the shore of
   Long Island Sound. The facility is comprised of two laboratory/office
   buildings and support buildings housing raceway and circular tanks. A
   49-foot  vessel, the R/V Victor Loosanoff, is also docked at the
   Laboratory for nearshore research.

   Present research emphasizes aquaculture and habitat-related work. A
   well-integrated aquaculture program includes studies of the culture of
   fish and shellfish to develop methods suitable for commercial use as
   well as for stock enhancement and restoration. Nearshore habitats are
   being studied to determine what characteristics make a habitat suitable
   for a particular species.
