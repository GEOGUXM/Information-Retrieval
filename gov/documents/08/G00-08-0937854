   The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is a Department of
   Defense (DoD) program run by the Air Force Space and Missle Systems
   Center (SMC). The DMSP designs, builds, launches, and maintains
   satellites monitoring the meteorological, oceanographic, and
   solar-terrestrial physics environments.

   Each DMSP satellite has a 101 minute, sun-synchronous near-polar orbit
   at an altitude of 830km above the surface of the earth. The visible and
   infrared sensors (OLS) collect images across a 3000km swath, providing
   global coverage twice per day. The combination of day/night and
   dawn/dusk satellites allows monitoring of global information such as
   clouds every 6 hours. The microwave imager (MI) and sounders (T1, T2)
   cover one half the width of the visible and infrared swath. These
   instruments cover polar regions at least twice and the equatorial
   region once per day. The space environment sensors (J4, M, IES) record
   along-track plasma densities, velocities, composition and drifts.

   The data from the DMSP satellites are received and used at operational
   centers continuously. The data are sent to the National Geophysical
   Data Center's Solar Terrestrial Physics Division (NGDC/STP) by the Air
   Force Weather Agency (AFWA) for creation of an archive.

   Currently, data from 4 satellites (3 day/night, 1 dawn/dusk) are added
   to the archive each day.
