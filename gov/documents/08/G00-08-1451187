   Thanks for visiting the DOOGIS homepage. These pages are best accessed
   using a Java compatible browser.

     * The basic idea of DOOGIS is that the entire internet is your
       database and, using object technology, you get intelligent spatial
       objects. Spatial objects can live anywhere on the internet, in
       spatial data servers, or they can be located on your local
       computer. They can be accessed with a Java applet as if they were
       in a single coherent database located on your computer. Objects can
       be downloaded to a Java applet as complete objects with all their
       data and behaviors, in a simplified form with limited
       functionality, or a collection of objects can be summarized into an
       image with no functionality. Even if a summary is downloaded, the
       functionality may still be available on the spatial data server.
     * What is an intelligent object? Its an object that performs some
       behavior or supplies data, be that a simple road with address data,
       a tank driving across a battlefield, or a simulation of the Earth's
       atmosphere.
     * How do we make objects intelligent? Using our object-oriented GIS,
       GeoViewer, as the spatial data server for DOOGIS, we can
       dynamically couple to models, simulations, and/or applications
       producing behaviors and data. The GeoViewer is both a framework to
       be included in modeling infrastructures and a standalone product.
       It has been used in a number of such frameworks including DOOGIS.
       For more information about the GeoViewer take a look at our paper
       (320Kb with images) and slide presentation.

   This is version 2.0 Beta of the DOOGIS system connected to a spatial
   data server written in Smalltalk. This version demonstrates the basic
   capabilities needed to provide typical GIS functionality such as
   zooming, panning, and getting information via the World Wide Web. There
   is some limited capability to download complete objects. It also
   demonstrates the ability to create objects within the Java applet and
   send them back to the spatial data server, in this case, objects that
   represent a URL. More work needs to be done on the Java end of things
   to bring it up to speed with the capabilities provided by the spatial
   data server, especially the GUI. This has been enhanced since the
   previous version, but could still use some improvement.

   We currently have TIGER data loaded for Champaign, Dupage, and Will
   counties in Illinois, and Duval County in Florida (near Jacksonville).
   The Illinois counties also include Census Tracts that can be brought
   over local to the client. There is also data loaded for a portion of
   Champaign county showing water wells, they show up as dots and then
   water drops when you zoom in far enough. There is also an mm5 weather
   model output grid shown over Pennsylvania and neighboring states. It
   shows wind speed by default.

   The current version of DOOGIS now works with most, possibly all
   Java-enabled browsers. If you run into any problems with the applet,
   please email with a description of the problem, and your browser name
   and version number and operating system and OS version.
