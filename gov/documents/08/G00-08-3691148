                     Summer Internship Programs at Fermilab

   There are three main summer internship programs at Fermilab. At this
   time, there are no formal internship programs that exist outside of the
   summer months. You can visit these web pages for more information.

   Each of these web pages has lots of information about these programs.
   Please take a moment to visit them now.
     * Fermilab Summer Internships in Science and Technology (SIST)
       Program.
       Objective: To provide summer internships in physics, engineering
       and computer science to undergraduate students attending college in
       the US. This program targets the traditionally underrepresented
       minorities in science: Hispanic, Native American and African
       American. See the web page for details.
     * Fermilab Teachers Research Associates (TRAC) Program.
       Objective: To provide outstanding seventh through twelfth grade
       science and mathematics teachers with professional scientific and
       engineering experiences through summer research opportunities,
       enhance their leadership skills, increase their awareness and
       understanding of current science and technology, promote the
       transfer of this knowledge to the classroom and provide an
       opportunity for renewal.
     * Fermilab Internships for Physics Majors (IPM) Program
       ObjectiveTo introduce students majoring in physics to the current
       methods and problems of high energy physics research. A small
       number of students from closely related disciplines such as
       computer science or engineering are also accepted into the program.
