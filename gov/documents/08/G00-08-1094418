                                   CARSTAD

     Center for Airborne Remote Sensing and Technology and Applications
                                 Development

   The purpose of CARSTAD is to promote remote sensing through the support
   of the airborne remote sensing business and of all activities related
   to airborne remote sensing.  Development of remote sensing from the
   "ground up" will benefit everyone in the business.  Currently, CARSTAD
   is in the form of a web site providing a wide-ranging source of
   information related to airborne remote sensing.  Eventually CARSTAD is
   seen as a source of airborne remote sensing services.  These will not
   be services that can be provided by commercial remote sensing
   organizations, but rather services that are not commercially available
   such as advanced technology and applications development, and
   specialized instrument characterization and calibration.

   Another important function of CARSTAD will be to serve as a model for
   other airborne remote sensing centers.  Organizations wishing to
   establish a center could use the CARSTAD resources to pick the
   functions that they wish to implement.  By fostering the development of
   airborne remote sensing centers, CARSTAD will promote remote sensing in
   general.  It is anticipated that among the more useful functions of
   airborne remote sensing centers will be to develop new instrument
   technologies and applications, and to develop ground truth sites for
   the vicarious calibration of space borne instruments.

   In contrast to typical remote sensing centers, the emphasis at CARSTAD
   will be on data collection rather than data processing.  There are
   already innumerable laboratories and organizations specializing in
   processing remotely sensed data.  CARSTAD will work with these
   organizations to provide new sources of remotely sensed data.

   An expanded description of  the proposed CARSTAD can be found at the
   CARSTAD Details page.  Contribution to the databases and suggestions
   for additional CARSTAD functions would be appreciated. Suggestions for
   potential CARSTAD sites and potential partners would also be
   appreciated, and discussion is welcomed.

   Note:  This site contains a great deal of information pertaining to
   airborne remote sensing and related topics.  It serves as an on-line
   "file cabinet" for the work that I am doing.  It is not organized
   particularly well, so the easiest way to find things may be by using
   the search tool.
