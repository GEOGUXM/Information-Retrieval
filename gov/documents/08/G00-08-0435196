   The National Council on Disability (NCD) is an independent federal
   agency making recommendations to the President and Congress on issues
   affecting 54 million Americans with disabilities. NCD is composed of 15
   members appointed by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In
   its 1986 report Toward Independence, NCD first proposed that Congress
   should enact a civil rights law for people with disabilities. In 1990,
   the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law.

   NCD's overall purpose is to promote policies, programs, practices, and
   procedures that guarantee equal opportunity for all individuals with
   disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability;
   and to empower individuals with disabilities to achieve economic
   self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration
   into all aspects of society.

   NCD is currently coordinating a multi-year study on the implementation
   and enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act and other civil
   rights laws.
