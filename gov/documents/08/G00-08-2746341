   What is the SSDS?
   The Space Science Data System is the confederation of groups supported

   using these data. Long-term data accessibility is ensured by SSDS
   archiving and preservation of the data.

   Who does SSDS serve?
   The SSDS customer community ranges from the NASA and international
   space science research communities to students, educators and the
   general public.
