Importance of Isotopic Data in Atmospheric Studies

   The proportions of the less abundant stable isotopes such as deuterium
   (^2H) and carbon-13 (^13C) in atmospheric species are controlled by
   various factors. The main factors are the isotopic composition of
   precursor molecules, the kinetics of production at sources, and the
   kinetics of removal at sinks. These kinetic processes are known as
   kinetic isotope effects. For the radioactive isotopes such as tritium
   (^3H) and carbon-14 (^14C) in atmospheric species, proportions are
   controlled primarily by cosmogenic production rates, emissions from
   nuclear reactors, and radioactive decay processes.

   As a result of these processes, the sources and sinks of atmospheric
   species are encoded in their isotopic compositions. With atmospheric
   methane, for example, large ^14CH[4] levels in ambient air may indicate
   the predominance of methane from modern sources such as wetlands, rice
   paddies and ruminates.

  The Isotopic Database for Atmospheric Methane and its Sources

   The existing database contains over a thousand reported measurements of
   CH[3]D, ^13CH[4], and ^14CH[4] at sources and in tropospheric air.
   These isotopic data are useful to modelers who quantify the global or
   regional methane budgets by comparing the isotopic compositions of
   methane in ambient air with the isotopic compositions of the aggregate
   of flux-weighted sources. Temporal and spatial isotopic variations in
   the database are also useful for distinguishing the types of methane in
   subsurface natural gas exploration and for understanding wetland
   methanogenic pathways.

   The methane isotopic database contains numeric and text information on
     * methane source types
     * sampling times, locations, collection procedures and measurement
       procedures
     * sampling and measurement uncertainties
     * isotopic measurements and associated statistics
     * data interpretation
     * references and personnel involved in data collection

   In the following pages, you will be able to search for specific
   isotopic information by
     * methane source type
     * years or seasons when samples were collected
     * latitude and longitude or latitudinal zone for locations of samples

   You will also be able to search on a specific database record number. A
   database record contains all of the information on a specific sample:
   numeric information such as measured values and sampling/measurement
   uncertainties as well as ancillary text information such as
   collection/measurement procedures and how the data were interpreted
   when first reported.

  Isotopic Database for Other Atmospheric Species

   NIST is planning to expand this database to include isotopic
   compositions of additional trace atmospheric species, primarily in the
   troposphere. Candidate species are carbonaceous, sulfate and nitrate
   aerosols, carbon monoxide, reduced sulfur compounds (e.g., H[2]S,
   CH[3]SCH[3]) and sulfur dioxide, and reduced nitrogen (e.g., N[2],
   NH[4]^+/NH[3]) and nitrogen oxides.

   We invite your comments - see email address below - on the need for
   additions to this database.
