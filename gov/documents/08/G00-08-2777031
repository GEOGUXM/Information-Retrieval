   With the new year, Americans fully realize that we live in a
   dramatically different nation than only a year ago. But despite the new
   realities facing us-whether related to the war on terrorism or the
   economic recession, we must still grapple with long-standing problems
   that existed prior to September 11. For New Mexico and the nation, one
   of the most paramount issues is improving health care coverage for a
   growing senior population.

   Although the second session of the 107th Congress is underway with the
   focus on the war on terrorism and bringing the U.S. economy out of
   recession, I believe we will have serious debates on improving senior
   health care this year.

   I am committed to improving the Medicare program so that it reflects
   the needs of the nearly 40 million Americans and approximately 230,000
   New Mexicans who rely on Medicare for their health care. But even a
   program as successful as Medicare can use some improvements,
   particularly after 35 years. Namely, we need to enact a Medicare
   prescription drug benefit.

   Prescription drug benefits were simply not relevant when Congress
   created Medicare in 1965. Today, we know better. Prescription drugs
   prevent, control, and treat a wide assortment of illnesses that did not
   even seem possible as recently as the 1980s. The lack of such a benefit
   is now one of the most serious shortcomings of the current Medicare
   program. I am well aware of the financial burden faced by many of New
   Mexico's seniors as they struggle to pay for the prescription drugs
   they need.

   Just last year, while I was still chairman of the Senate Budget
   Committee, we passed a Budget Resolution that contained my provision
   creating a $300 billion fund for a Medicare prescription drug benefit.
   Unfortunately, the tragic events of September 11 precluded action on
   almost all unrelated issues. However, Congress can and should join
   together to finally enact a meaningful prescription drug benefit for
   Medicare beneficiaries.

   In another important area, I will continue to work on a bipartisan
   basis to try to correct the extremely low Medicare reimbursement rates
   for health care providers in New Mexico. Because we live in a
   predominantly rural state, the Medicare program pays our doctors,
   hospitals, and nursing homes a lower rate than states with larger urban
   populations. As a result, Medicare spending in New Mexico averages
   about $3,700 per Medicare beneficiary, compared to a national average
   of $5,500.

   In the past, I have worked to raise the reimbursement rates for
   Medicare providers. Most recently, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., joined me to
   successfully address the geographic disparities for reimbursements
   within the Medicare+Choice program. We raised the minimum reimbursement
   to $525 per beneficiary per month for Metropolitan Statistical Areas of
   250,000 people or more and $475 for rural areas. While these
   improvements are an important first step, the low reimbursements need
   to be higher if our seniors are to continue receiving the best and most
   affordable health care available.

   These two issues are just an example of the unique health care
   challenges facing New Mexico seniors, many of whom have to travel
   hundreds of miles to visit the state's only tertiary care center in
   Albuquerque.

   So as the 107th Congress progresses, I am committed to seek
   opportunities to both maintain and improve the quality, accessability,
   and affordability of health care for New Mexico's seniors.
