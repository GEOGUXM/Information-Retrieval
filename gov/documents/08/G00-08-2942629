[pvw2.gif] Welcome to the Pennsylvania Wing of the Civil Air Patrol,
           the official civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force. Civil
           Air Patrol is an all volunteer, non-combatant resource of the USAF,
           created in 1941.
           Today, Civil Air Patrol has three primary missions: Cadet Programs,
           Emergency Services, and Aerospace Education, with over 50,000  cadet
           and senior members nationwide.
           Within the PA Wing there are over sixty-three (63) squadrons in
           local communities across the Commonwealth with Twenty-two (22) CAP
           owned aircraft positioned at airports across the state.

           PA Wing provides training opportunities at it's Hawk Mountain Ranger
           Training Area. Find that link here.

   Important Note to all:

   The Pa Wing websites, including Hawk Mountain's website, uses the CAP
   Great Lakes Region server. Over the past week their host server went
   down permanently. So it was a week or so until it was completely
   replaced and upgraded in the process.

   This affected the list servers, websites, and email forwarding. It's
   all coming back slowly, but in the meantime please be patient. The
   other bad news is that the list servers all need to be reprogrammed.
   The instructions on how to reregister for all lists are just below.

   Thanks
