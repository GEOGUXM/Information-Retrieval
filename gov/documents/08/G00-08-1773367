   Principia Cybernetica Web


                       Welcome to Principia Cybernetica Web


   Principia Cybernetica tries to tackle age-old philosophical questions
   with the help of the most recent cybernetic theories and technologies.
     __________________________________________________________________

      This is the website of the Principia Cybernetica Project (PCP), an
      international organization. The Project aims to develop a complete
      philosophy or "world-view", based on the principles of evolutionary
      cybernetics, and supported by collaborative computer technologies. To
      get started, there is an introduction with background and motivation,
      and an overview, summarizing the project as a whole.
