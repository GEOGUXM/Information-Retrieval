   The InterPlanetary Network and Information Systems Directorate (IPN
   ISD) Deep Space Mission System (DSMS) Engineering Program Office
   at JPL provides a multimission facility for processing science
   instrument data from NASA's planetary missions. This facility, the
   Multimission Image Processing Lab (MIPL) is developed and maintained by
   the Science Instrument Services (SIS) System within IPN ISD to meet
   requirements that span the NASA family of planetary missions.

   There are several components which make up the Multimission Image
   Processing System (MIPS). The multimission science instrument data
   processing software system called VICAR as well as a multimission data
   management system are major components of MIPS.

   The VICAR system is a general purpose software system which is adapted
   to meet specific mission requirements. VICAR is available for use by
   science investigators who are NASA funded. The multimission data
   management system provides a data cataloging and indexing function
   supporting the production of science data products and other services
   supporting science instrument data processing within MIPS. MIPS
   produces archival data records on CD-ROM media in formats specified by
   the Planetary Data System.
