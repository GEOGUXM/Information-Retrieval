   Aging NASA Spacecraft to Reenter Earth's Atmosphere

      artist drawing of EUVE spacecraft Engineers at NASA Goddard Space
      Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., predict a 7,000-pound spacecraft could
      re-enter the Earth's atmosphere as early as 10 p.m. EST on Jan. 30 or
      as late as 7 a.m. EST on Jan. 31. NASA's Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer
      (EUVE) is currently 200 kilometers (124 miles) above the Earth with a
      descent rate of 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) a day. The estimated debris
      field is expected to be 800 to 1,000 kilometers (500-625 miles). "The
      probability of the few EUVE surviving pieces falling into a populated
      area and hurting someone is very small. It is more likely that the
      small pieces will fall into the ocean or fall harmlessly to the
      ground," said Ronald E. Mahmot, Project Manager for Space Science
      Mission Operations at Goddard. (Full Story)
