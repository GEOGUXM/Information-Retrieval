                    NWRC Spatial Data and Metadata Server
     __________________________________________________________________

   This site contains geospatially referenced data, much of which is
   biological in nature, and other information. The Spatial Data and
   Metadata Server (SDMS) represents NWRC's commitment to data
   accessibility through compliance and cooperation with the National
   Information Infrastructure (NII) which includes both the National
   Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and the National Biological
   Information Infrastructure (NBII). Resources on this site relate to the
   requirements of Executive Order 12906, for participation in the NSDI
   and the requirements of USGS Biological Resource Division regarding the
   NBII. Both directives require NWRC to document existing and newly
   developed data using specific content standards for metadata, and
   require that these metadata be electronically accessible.
