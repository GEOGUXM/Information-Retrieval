KSC has established itself as the primary NASA Center conducting research
related to managing biological systems for applications in life support
systems in space and ecological conservation and sustained agriculture on
Earth. The biological research and development effort for the Biological
Sciences Branch consist of two primary efforts - Controlled Biological
Systems (CBS) and Natural Ecological Systems (NES) projects.

These two research and development efforts are fundamentally separate because
one addresses the use of biological or agricultural systems for life support
during long duration space flights; while the other address the management of
ecological systems on earth to ensure their conservation. There is sufficient
overlap between these two efforts, however, that research and technology
development when completed in one area is often useful in the other.
