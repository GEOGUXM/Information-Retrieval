   Establishment of the Board

        In 1994, when the Congress passed legislation establishing the
   Social Security Administration as an independent agency, it also
   created a 7-member bipartisan Advisory Board to advise the President,
   the Congress, and the Commissioner of Social Security on matters
   relating to the Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
   programs. The conference report on this legislation passed both Houses
   of Congress without opposition. President Clinton signed the Social
   Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994 into law on
   August 15, 1994 (P.L. 103-296).

   How Board Members are Appointed

        Advisory Board members are appointed to 6-year terms, made up as
   follows: 3 appointed by the President (no more than two from the same
   political party); and 2 each (no more than one from the same political
   party) by the Speaker of the House (in consultation with the Chairman
   and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on Ways and Means) and by
   the President pro tempore of the Senate (in consultation with the
   Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on Finance).
   Presidential appointees are subject to Senate confirmation.

        Board members serve staggered terms. The statute provides that the
   initial members of the Board serve terms that expire over the course of
   the first 6-year period.

        The Chairman of the Board is appointed by the President for a
   4-year term, coincident with the term of the President, or until the
   designation of a successor.

   The Work of the Board

        The Board began holding substantive meetings in late Spring of
   1996. Since that time, it has been meeting monthly, addressing a wide
   variety of issues important to the Social Security and SSI programs.
   Thus far most of the Board's efforts have centered on the examination
   of issues related to long-term financing for Social Security, changes
   in the disability programs, policy development by the Social Security
   Administration, a long-range research and program evaluation plan for
   SSA, increasing public understanding of Social Security and service to
   the public.
