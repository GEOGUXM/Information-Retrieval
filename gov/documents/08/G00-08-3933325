Current Tasks & Projects

     * Robotic Autonomy Architecture Research Team -- helping design JPL's
       next generation rover technology. Rocky 8 is the experimental rover
       that we test software on.
     * StarLight -- the first ever formation-flying space interferometer.
       Large baseline interferometers will eventually allow us to image
       planets in orbit around distant stars. As part of their "Inside
       JPL"series, Space.com has published a story titled "Tomorrow's
       Telescope: Wish Upon a Fake Star" about StarLight and my boss, Gary
       Blackwood.

   More Cool Stuff:
     * FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology)
       Blatantly ripped from FIRST's web site:

     The FIRST Robotics Competition is a national engineering contest
     which immerses high school students in the exciting world of
     engineering. Teaming up with engineers from businesses and
     universities, students get a hands-on, inside look at the
     engineering profession. In six intense weeks, students and engineers
     work together to brainstorm, design, construct and test their
     "champion robot". With only six weeks, all jobs are critical path.
     The teams then compete in a spirited, no-holds-barred tournament
     complete with referees, cheerleaders and time clocks.

     The partnerships developed between schools, businesses, and
     universities provide an exchange of resources and talent,
     highlighting mutual needs, building cooperation, and exposing
     students to new career choices. The result is a fun, exciting and
     stimulating environment in which all participants discover the
     important connection between classroom lessons and real world
     applications.

     Each year, the competition is different, so returning teams always
     have a new challenge to look forward to. However, the details are
     kept secret until the unveiling at the Kick-Off workshop. This
     provides a high level of excitement as everyone sees the new
     challenge for the first time and ideas immediately begin forming in
     people's minds.

     I worked with a great group of Teachers and kids from Crescenta
     Valley High School in La Crescenta, California. In six weeks the
     kids put together a terrific robot that we competed in the Southern
     California Regional. Some great photos can be found on the CVHS
     Robotics Club web site. My experiences were published in the JPL
     newspaper, The Universe, on April 13, 2001. The article can be found
     here. If you'd like more information, feel free to e-mail me.

     I just noticed that the FIRST website has a bunch of new photos up
     from the 2001 national championship.
