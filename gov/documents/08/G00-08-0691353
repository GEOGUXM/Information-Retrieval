                                      [wedge_sm.gif] Snow Emergency e-mail

     Is your sidewalk shoveled? The law says it must be shoveled within 24
   hours. You may report an unshoveled sidewalk, and the City will require
     the property owner to clear the walk -- or do the work and charge the
                                                    property owner for it.

  If youd like a direct e-mail whenever there are Snow Emergency parking
       regulations, sign up now to be put on the mailing list. You will be
             sent an e-mail as soon as the City declares a Snow Emergency.
