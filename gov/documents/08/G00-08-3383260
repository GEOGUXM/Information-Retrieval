   The quarterly Fishery Bulletin (FB) is the oldest and one of the finest
   fisheries journals in the world. It has been an official publication of
   the U.S. Government since 1881, under various titles, and is the U.S.
   counterpart to other highly regarded governmental fisheries science
   publications. It publishes original research or interpretative articles
   in all scientific fields that bear on marine fisheries and marine
   mammal science.

   Manuscripts submitted for publication in the Fishery Bulletin and
   Technical Reports undergo peer review by senior scientists within and
   outside the government. The NMFS Scientific Editor, a scientist
   affiliated with one of the NMFS Science Centers who serves for a
   three-year period, is responsible for conducting the peer reviews and
   for accepting or rejecting manuscripts.
