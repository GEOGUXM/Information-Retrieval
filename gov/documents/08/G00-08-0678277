      THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MANAGEMENT
                ASSISTANCE AUTHORITY WILL SUSPEND OPERATIONS

EFFECTIVE 12 MIDNIGHT, SEPTEMBER 30, 2001

   The District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management
   Assistance Authority (“the Authority”) will suspend all operations at
   12 Midnight, September 30, 2001.

   Public Law 104-8, the D.C. Financial Responsibility and Management
   Assistance Authority Act of 1995, established the Authority. The
   legislation requires the Authority to suspend activities once the
   following four (4) specific pre-conditions have been met:

   1.     All obligations arising from the issuance by the Authority of
   bonds, notes, or other obligations have been discharged;

   2.     All borrowings by and on behalf of the District of Columbia from
   the U.S. Treasury have been repaid;

   3.     The District Government has adequate access to both short term
   and long term credit markets at reasonable rates to meet its borrowing
   needs; and

   4.     For four consecutive fiscal years the District has achieved a
   balanced budget as determined in accordance with generally accepted
   accounting principles (“GAAP”).

   The last of the pre-conditions was achieved in February, 2001, when the
   fourth consecutive balanced budget for the District of Columbia was
   certified based on the FY 2000 CAFR (Comprehensive Annual Financial
   Report).

   All Authority operations will therefore be suspended when the current
   fiscal year ends, September 30, 2001, at 12 Midnight.
