                 Operating Missions as Nodes on the Internet

     OMNI is the first end-to-end demonstration of operating NASA
     missions as nodes on an IP (Internet Protocol) network utilizing
     existing technologies. OMNI demonstrates a new approach to mission
     design and operations and increases understanding of cost savings,
     benefits, and risks.

 Presentation summarizing OMNI concepts, technical details, demonstrations,
                              and test results
     * Jan. 9, 2002: OMNI project to put second web-server in space! The
       world's first web server in space is about to be followed by
       another. NASA/GSFC plans to test its second web server in space
       this summer with the launch of the LPT/CANDOS payload, one of
       several Hitchhiker payloads set to fly on STS-107. See the press
       release and the photos of the LPT in the clean-room assembly area
       at GSFC.
     * May. 22, 2001: OMNI project delivers comprehensive presentation on
       Space Internet concepts, technical details, demonstrations, and
       test results at NRO Technical Seminar series. See the PowerPoint
       presentation for full details.
     * Jan. 25, 2001: UoSat-12 becomes the world's first web-server in
       space! HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to transfer
       real-time telemetry and stored instrument data directly from the
       spacecraft to an end user. See the screenshots in the test section
       for full details.
     * Jan. 9,17,24, 2001: A committee appointed by the GSFC Director Al
       Diaz conducted a 3 day IP-in-Space Peer Review. Copies of the 1/17
       and 1/24 presentations are available in the documents section.
     * Nov. 13-15, 2000: The OMNI project makes six presentations at the
       First Joint Space Internet Workshop at GSFC in Greenbelt, MD.
     * Sep 21, 2000: The OMNI project presents a paper on Internet
       Technology on Spacecraft at the AIAA Space 2000 Conference in Long
       Beach, CA. [keith1sm.jpg]
     * Aug 23,2000: The OMNI project presents a paper on Internet Access
       to Spacecraft at the 14^th annual Small Satellite Conference at
       Utah State University in Logan, Utah.
     * July 25, 2000: UoSat-12 FTP testing results are now available on
       the web site.
     * June 7, 2000: FTP testing continues from UoSat-12. Successfully
       downloaded a four image mosaic of Australia.
     * May 31, 2000: "First light" image for FTP! A thumbnail greyscale
       image of the earth from one the cameras on UoSat-12 was downloaded
       via FTP from the spacecraft to GSFC. This represents the first time
       FTP has been used to achieve error-free transport of spacecraft
       instrument data directly from the spacecraft to the end user.
     * May 24, 2000: The first standard (fully end-to-end RFC compliant)
       FTP session and transfer of a file from an orbiting satellite were
       accomplished today from the OMNI lab using the UoSAT-12 spacecraft.
       This included logging on to the FTP server onboard the spacecraft
       via password access, as in any standard FTP session. FTP testing
       will continue in the coming weeks.
