   Commerce Secretary Don Evans Calls on Senate to Pass Smith Amendment

   Washington, DC, January 25 - Commerce Secretary Donald Evans today
   called on the Senate to pass the Smith Amendment to the economic
   stimulus package. "We need to do all we can at this time to keep
   America working and reinvigorate our great economic engine.
   Accelerating depreciation over the next three years, as the President
   proposed, could provide meaningful stimulus for our innovators and
   entrepreneurs. By contrast, the one-year proposal offered by the
   Majority Leader will do far less for our workers and businesses."
