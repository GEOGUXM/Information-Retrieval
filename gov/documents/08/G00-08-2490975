   Welcome!

   Here is a valuable site for help with developing DQOs and implementing
   the DQO Process. At this site, you can find information to become
   familiar with one type of structured planning process for collection of
   "good" environmental data to support decision-making. We will
   demonstrate the DQO steps and show you tools for formulating a problem,
   identifying the decisions to be made, specifying the quality
   requirements for the decisions -- which lead to the quality
   requirements for the data, and finally developing a defensible sampling
   and analysis plan.

                                                    How many samples to take?

   The DQO Web Site was developed by the Statistics & Quantitative
   Sciences group at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) for
   the Department of Energy's Office of Safety, Health and Security (EM-5)
   and supported under Systematic Planning for the Data, Decisions, and
   Documentation Program. PNNL is located in Richland, WA and is operated
   for the Department of Energy by Battelle.

   Changes, corrections, and additions to the DQO Web Site are listed in
   What's New.
