   New Report Questions Statistical Adjustment

   WASHINGTON A new report issued today by the Congressional Members of
   the U.S. Census Monitoring Board examines the scientific methodology
   behind statistical adjustment.
   The 2000 census was the most accurate census in history, said board
   Co-Chair A. Mark Neuman.  With the dramatic reduction in the
   differential undercount compared to 1990, one can see why the
   professionals at the Census Bureau chose not to recommend the use of
   statistically adjusted numbers.  In the coming weeks and months we will
   be studying to what extent statistical adjustment would have put
   persons missed in the census back into the neighborhoods where they
   were missed, he said.  We must not only attempt to count everyone
   living in America, we must make sure they are counted at the correct
   address.

                                                                   more...

   A Bi-Partisan Board

   In November 1997, Congress established the Census Monitoring Board, an
   eight-member bipartisan oversight board charged to observe and monitor
   all aspects of the preparation and implementation of the 2000 census.
   Co-Chairman A. Mark Neuman leads Congressionally-appointed members Dr.
   David Murray and Joe Whitley, Esq. Since its inception, the
   Congressional Members of the Monitoring Board has been a strong voice
   for reducing the traditional undercount of minorities and children
   through proven techniques and community empowerment.
