                            Welcome to Our Court

   On behalf of the Judges and staff of the United States Bankruptcy Court
   for the Southern District of Georgia, we welcome you to our new web
   site.

   We are offering this service as a way to provide you with easy access
   to timely, accurate and relative information. In time we will be adding
   additional informational items to our web site. Items such as Local
   Rules, Fee Schedules, Division Office Locations, Bankruptcy Desk
   Reference Manual, and changes to our public access systems such as
   RACER and BRASS and online court calendars will be appearing in the
   near future.

   We are excited about this step into the future and pledge to make it a
   productive part of your working relationship with the bankruptcy court.
   We encourage you to use this site often and participate in its
   development. Please let us know what you consider to be valuable. We
   welcome your suggestions for improvement. Please submit your comments
   and suggestions to Webmaster.
