   We share the exciting discoveries and knowledge from NASA Sun-Earth
   Connection missions and research programs with educators, students, and
   the general public. The SECEF partnership brings together the rich
   expertise of scientists, educators, and museums to develop innovative
   products and programs.

   Our goal is to increase science literacy and focus attention on the
   active Sun and its effects on Earth.
