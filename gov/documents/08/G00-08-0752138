                               Dan L. Crippen:
                       "The deficit projected for this
    year -- $21 billion -- represents a change of more than $300 billion
      from last January's projection. Over 70 percent of that reduction
                        results from the weak economy
                     and related technical factors ..."

                         Chairman Jim Nussle: "Either we
                       manage 9/11, or 9/11 manages us."
                             "The question is, can
                              Washington make the
                            tough choices necessary
                           to re-prioritize spending
                              in the aftermath of
                            September 11 and get us
                            back on track. If those
                             tough choices are not
                           made, we will be setting
                           ourselves up to return to
                         budgets with deficits as far
       as the eye can see. I, for one, do not consider that an option."
