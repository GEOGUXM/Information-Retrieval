                Welcome to the Department of Water Resources,
                   Office of State Water Project Planning
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Office of State Water Project Planning (OSP) is charged with
   planning facilities and developing strategies to improve the capability
   of the State Water Project to meet the needs of its users for a
   reliable water supply of sufficient quantity and quality. The Office
   accomplishes this by working with the SWP Contractors to determine
   their needs; conducting feasibility investigations of potential
   projects; working with State and federal regulatory agencies, as well
   as private parties, to identify and minimize potential negative
   impacts; completing the required environmental documentation; and
   obtaining permits needed to proceed with implementing the project.
   Projects may include reservoirs, groundwater management programs, or
   increased conveyance capability of pumping plants.

   Because the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is the source of supply for
   SWP water users south of Sacramento, OSP also plans projects aimed at
   protecting islands via land management and levee improvements, and
   fisheries in the Delta by improving flow conditions. Staff members
   working on Delta issues also formulate strategies and recommendations
   to effectively represent the Department's interests in State and
   federal Bay-Delta regulatory proceedings. In addition, OSP staff
   supports and coordinates with the CALFED Bay-Delta Program.

   The Office incorporates a number of analytical techniques, primarily
   computer modeling, to assist in planning and management of California's
   water resources. The Office develops and applies these computer models
   to analyze potential effects of new project facilities such as
   reservoirs and conveyance facilities. Studies are also performed to
   evaluate the effects of various changes in CVP and SWP operational
   constraints and the resulting flows, stages, water quality and habitat
   changes which may occur especially in natural rivers and in the
   Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Results from these studies are used for
   Department planning, CALFED Bay-Delta evaluations, State Water
   Resources Control Board water rights processes, and many other
   purposes.
