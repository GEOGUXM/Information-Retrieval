                 Quantum Computation/Cryptography at Los Alamos

   Schrodinger Cat "Where a calculator on the Eniac is equipped with 18000
          vacuum tubes and weighs 30 tons, computers in the future may
          have only 1000 tubes and weigh only 1 1/2 tons"
          Popular Mechanics, March 1949
          This Homepage will give you an overview of the work done at Los
          Alamos on Quantum Computation and Cryptography as well as
          related links.
          The idea of quantum computation and cryptography is to use the
          laws of quantum mechanics for either computing or exchange
          secrets messages. Using quantum mechanics instead of classical
          mechanics has huge advantages but also some drawbacks. Quantum
          mechanics makes the applications much more powerful but at the
          same time much more fragile against noise. To learn more about
          this browse around!

   [expqec.GIF] Experimental Quantum Error Correction (or pdf) Quantum
   error correction is required to compensate for the fragility of the
   state of a quantum computer. We report the first experimental
   implementations of quantum error correction and confirm the expected
   state stabilization. A precise study of the decay behavior is studied
   in alanine and a full implemetation of error correction protocol is
   implemented in trichloroethylene. In NMR computing, however, a net
   improvement in the signal-to-noise would require very high
   polarization. The experiment implemented the 3-bit code for phase
   errors in liquid state state NMR.

   [teleportation.jpeg ]
   Quantum Teleportation (or pdf). Quantum mechanics provides spectacular
   new information processing abilities. One of the most unexpected is a
   procedure called quantum teleportation suggested by Bennet et al. that
   allows the quantum state of a system to be transported from one
   location to another, without moving through the intervening space. We
   have implemented the full quantum teleportation operation over
   inter-atomic distances using liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR). The inclusion of the final stage enables for the first time a
   teleportation implementation which may be used as a subroutine in
   larger quantum computations, or for quantum communication. Our
   experiment also demonstrates the use of quantum process tomography , a
   procedure to completely characterize the dynamics of a quantum system.
   Finally, we demonstrate a controlled exploitation of decoherence as a
   tool to assist in the performance of an experiment.
