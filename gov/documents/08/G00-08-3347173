Comparison of Effluent Concentration from the Existing and Future Boston
Harbor Sewage Outfalls

   Simulation of effluent dilution from the existing and future Boston
   Sewage effluent outfalls based on a three-dimensional circulation model
   of Massachusetts Bay during Jan-Mar 1990 and Jun-Aug 1990. Isosurfaces
   (three-dimensional contours) of effluent concentration are shown
   representing 1 part effluent to 200 parts seawater. This is a level
   below which nutrient inputs due to the outfall should be hard to
   distinguish above background fluctuations. During both the winter and
   summer months the effluent from the future outfall (represented by the
   blue isosurface) covers a smaller region than the effluent from the
   existing outfall (represented by the purple isosurface).

   These simulations were used as evidence to assess the impact of the
   future outfall on endangered right whales.

Tidal Flushing of Boston Harbor

   Simulation of tidal exchange in Boston Harbor , based on a
   high-resolution (100 m grid spacing) depth-averaged computer model.
   Water in Boston Harbor is dyed red, and tracked over three tidal
   cycles. Colors between red and blue represent mixing of Boston Harbor
   water with Massachusetts Bay water (dyed blue). Due to the jet-like
   behavior of the ebb tidal currents, water is expelled from the harbor
   in pulses, leading to effective flushing of the harbor over several
   days.

Simulated Particle Trajectories Under a Steady Northeast Wind.

   Neutrally buoyant floats are tracked for 15 days in circulation driven
   by a steady 10 m/s Northeast wind. The color of the float is an
   additional visual cue for depth: when the floats are near the surface,
   they are red; when they are at 100 m, they are blue. The particles move
   back and forth with the 12.4 hour period M2 tide, in addition to moving
   with the wind-driven currents.

Upwelling in Massachusetts Bay during June-July 1990

   Near-surface temperature (2 m depth) is tracked for 30 days during the
   summer of 1990, revealing episodic upwelling response to southwest
   winds. These winds bring cold, nutrient rich water up to the surface in
   a broad band from Cape Cod Bay to Cape Ann.

   Spring Freshet in Massachusetts Bay during April-May 1992

      Near-surface salinity (2 m depth) is tracked during May 1992, revealing
      a plume of fresh water from the Merrimack River that moves into
      Massaschusetts Bay. The yellow arrow that flops around indicates the
      wind direction and speed. Note that a snapshot of the salinity on May
      22 (as one might sample from a monthly CTD cruise) would give the
      distinct visual impression of a large plume from Boston Harbor, when in
      fact most of this water came from the Merrimack River!

   Relative Sea Level Change in Massachusetts Bay: 14,000 years to present

      A sea-level curve for the northeastern Massachusetts coastal region was
      used to make this simulation of sea level change over the last 14,000
      years. Isostatic rebound effects are included, but are shown relative
      to land (instead of land rising while sea-level remains nearly
      constant, we show sea-level falling while land remains constant). Note
      that this simulation assumes that the land and seafloor topography in
      the past was the same as the present, obviously not strictly true for
      sandy features such as Cape Cod!
