   Welcome!
   From MHC Co-Chairs
   Susan Molinari and Richard Ravitch
   National housing policy stands at a crossroads.

   On the one hand, the past century saw the evolution of a housing
   finance system that is the envy of the world. There have been dramatic
   improvements in housing quality, surging homeownership rates, and
   important strides made to ease excessive housing costs for lower-income
   families. The result has been that average Americans are considered
   among the best housed in the world.

   Yet, the nation is at risk of letting those hard won gains slip away. A
   growing number of Americans are finding it increasingly difficult to
   find a decent and affordable place to live. And an estimated 14 million
   families now spend more than 50 percent of their income on housing or
   live in severely substandard housing. The nation faces a growing
   mismatch between where jobs are being created and where affordable
   housing is available. The growing gap in homeownership rates between
   whites and minorities is persistent and troubling.

   To help lead the nation from the present crossroads to a brighter
   housing future, the United States Congress created the bi-partisan
   Millennial Housing Commission to help them fashion proposals to improve
   the housing opportunities in this country. The Commission will issue
   its report to Congress in March 2002.

   The issues are complex and numerous and the time frame is short. So we
   very much welcome your comments and suggestions. This Web site is
   designed to be interactive. We strongly urge you to contact us, either
