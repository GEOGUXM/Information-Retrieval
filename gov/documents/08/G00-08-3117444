   Satellites orbiting the Earth send data back to the National Oceanic
   and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA's CoastWatch program
   processes this raw data so that others may use it.

   The resulting images are more than beautiful pictures from outer space.
   These images help meteorologists predict weather, fishermen locate
   fish, and scientists track oil spills and red tide events. The audience
   for satellite imagery is growing, thanks in large part to the growth of
   powerful personal computers and increasing Internet access. Today
   sailors and commercial shipping pilots log on to check sea surface
   winds, and educators from middle school to college use CoastWatch
   images to introduce students to the world as seen from space.
