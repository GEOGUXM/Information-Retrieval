   Right Whale Early Warning System

                          Right Whale Early Warning
                             System (EWS), FL/GA

      The Navy, Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers joined in the effort
      to spot and track the Northern Right Whale during its annual calving
      season off Georgia and northern Florida. During over flights of the
      area, military personnel use marine radio to report the location of
      whales. As a result, ship captains can maintain efficient speeds into
      and out of ports with the confidence that they can avoid collisions
   with whales. Learn more about this project.

             In 1996 the Coastal America Partnership established a network of
       Coastal Ecosystem Learning Centers. The network combines the resources
           of federal agencies with marine educational centers. Most Learning
         Centers are aquariums, but marine science centers and even a fishing
                                             museum are part of this network!

      Corporate Partnership (CWRP)

   Ed Bill's CWRP fishway project

      The Ed Bill's Pond riverine migratory corridor was the first project to
      receive funding from the newly established Connecticut Corporate
      Wetlands Restoration Program (CWRP). In the CWRP, corporations
      contribute funds to a participating private foundation or state trust
      fund. These funds will be used to support site specific wetland or
      other aquatic habitat restoration projects.
