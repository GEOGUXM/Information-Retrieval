   Mission:  Develop practical fusion energy as a solution to the
   long-term energy problems facing society.

   Los Alamos collaborates in the world fusion program, which focuses on
   conventional magnetic confinement (tokamak) and inertial confinement
   (laser) approaches to fusion.  We strongly support the recent shift of
   emphasis in fusion research towards more cost-effective fusion
   concepts.  Currently,  Los Alamos has two active and growing innovative
   confinement projects:  the Penning Fusion Experiment and Magnetized
   Target Fusion.

   The 2nd International Conference on Magnetized Target Fusion was held
   at the University of Nevada, Reno, Aug. 7-9, 2001. Approximately 60
   scientists and engineers attended, including overseas from Russia and
   New Zealand.
