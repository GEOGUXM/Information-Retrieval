 As part of JPL’s Division of Earth and Space Sciences (32), the Atmospheric
   Chemistry Research Element undertakes fundamental and applied research in
          atmospheric science of both Earth and planetary atmospheres.
   The Earth atmospheric science research comprises components in laboratory
  measurements, field measurements, and atmospheric modeling.  The laboratory
      measurement program is centered on the photochemistry, kinetics, and
 spectroscopy of species important to tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry.
The field measurements include the participation of several balloon and aircraft
 instruments (ALIAS, laser hygrometer, UV Ozone, MkIV, FILOS, solar radiometer)
 in major NASA campaigns (e.g. AASE, SPADE, POLARIS, SOLVE) devoted to studying
ozone chemistry, atmospheric transport, and radiation.  In addition, as part of
NASA’s Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change (NDSC), ground-based UV
 laser, and solar FTIR/ FTUV remote sensing measurements are made out of Table
Mountain Facility, California, and Mauna Loa, Hawaii.  This research element is
           also the home of the JPL Balloon Flight Support Facility.
 The planetary activities are focused on instrument development for identifying
  chemical signature of life, and supporting laboratory spectroscopy.  Tunable
laser spectrometers (TDL and QC) have been developed for in situ measurement of
    biogenic gases and isotope ratios on Mars, Titan, Venus, and Europa, for
deployment on a wide variety of platforms, including descending probe, aerobot,
Mars airplane, and lander.  High-resolution FTIR and tunable laser spectroscopy
is undertaken in both the near-IR and mid-IR wavelength region of several gases
  of planetary interest, including CO[2], CH[4], with a particular emphasis on
                               isotopic species.
