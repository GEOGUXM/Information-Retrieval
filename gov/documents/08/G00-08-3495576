   Happy New Year. Welcome to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor,
   and Pensions' web site. This site has been developed to provide you
   with up-to-date information about the Committee. The second session of
   the 107th Congress promises to be an important and busy session. This
   site offers easy access to issues and legislation before the Committee.
   Our schedule of hearings will be posted at the beginning of each month.
   Witness lists and prepared testimony will be posted as available. In
   addition, you can access hearings and testimony from the 106th and
   105th Congresses.

   While we cannot duplicate information or publications that are
   available on other government sites, we do try to point you in the
   right direction. Visit the Federal Links section for additional
   resource sites.
