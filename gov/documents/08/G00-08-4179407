"The educational experience was awesome It brought the ideas and topics that
we cover in class to life."

                           Tom Froats, Prospect HS, Mt. Prospect, Illinois

"The experience of this trip will have a great influence on how I teach
certain science concepts in the future."

            Susan Carty, Stetson Middle School, West Chester, Pennsylvania

"The objective of the Teacher at Sea program is to give science teachers at
all levels of education an opportunity to experience 'real-life scientific
research' first hand, so that they might better understand what goes on in
the field, and then be able to bring those experiences back to their students
in the classroom. And in that respect, I think the program does an
outstanding job! I know that I have a much better appreciation for scientific
research in today's highly sophisticated technological world, and I'm also
sure that I will bore my students with sea stories for years to come"

               Tom Gillman, College of the Desert, Palm Desert, California
