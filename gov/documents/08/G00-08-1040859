The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is responsible for a broad spectrum of
space Science missions and instruments and plays a significant role in
advancing the frontiers of space physics, astrophysics, and earth observation
science. The Laboratory is taking a new approach to space exploration in the
form of smaller spacecraft, capable of autonomous operation, and costing and
weighing significantly less than present designs. JPL's SBIR Program will
support the contributions of other JPL/NASA programs in acheiving these
objectives.
