                            TLC WEB SITE NOTICE!

The Learning Center for Interactive Technology is closing after 16 years of
operation.

This server is still being made available temporarily. An announcement will be
made here when it shuts down.

              Click here to access home page of the old server:
                     HREF=tlc.nlm.nih.gov/temphome.html

    Click here to be directed to the new server http://collab.nlm.nih.gov
                 or wait to be directed there automatically.

   Reasons for closing and next steps:
     * The widespread use of Internet technologies has made it unnecessary
       for people to physically visit a central repository of health
       professions education applications.
     * Since TLC's transfer NLM's Office of High Performance Computing and
       Communication (OHPCC), it's functions and resources are being
       transformed into a collaboratory supporting internal R and D
       complementing that which the office funds externally.
     * A collab web server is now available and some of the resources on
       this server have been moved to the collab server. Users will be
       redirected to resources which have moved to that server.
