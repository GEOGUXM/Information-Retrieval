Introduction:

   The Local Analysis and Prediction Branch performs high resolution
   analyses and forecasts of the weather using both locally and centrally
   available meteorological observations. The LAPB Branch is a component
   of NOAA's Forecast Systems Laboratory.

   The Local Analysis and Prediction System (LAPS) integrates data from
   virtually every meteorological observation system into a very
   high-resolution gridded framework centered on a forecast office's
   domain of responsibility. Thus, the data from local mesonetworks of
   surface observing systems, Doppler radars, satellites, wind and
   temperature (RASS) profilers (404 and boundary-layer 915 MHz), as well
   as aircraft are incorporated every hour into a three-dimensional grid
   covering a 1000km by 1240km area. LAPS has analysis and prediction
   components. The prediction component is being configured using the SFM
   (modified RAMS), MM5, and ETA models. Any or all of these models,
   usually being initialized with LAPS analyses, are run to provide 0-18
   hour forecasts. We have several online LAPS presentations.

   LAPS is run in real-time at FSL for a domain centered on the Denver, CO
   Weather Forecast Office. Local implementations include our LAPB branch
   machine (ren) and the AWIPS/ WFO-Advanced workstation. LAPS output is
   often shown at the daily weather briefings. LAPS is an integral part of
   the Water In All Phases (WIAP) project that we are embarking on.

   LAPS has been ported to various universities such as Univ. of Oklahoma
   ("OLAPS"), and Univ. of North Dakota. LAPS is running on-site at each
   National Weather Service Forecast Office (WFO) as an integral part of
   AWIPS. We are also running LAPS externally to AWIPS at WFOs in Seattle,
   Atlanta (Olympics), Lubbock, Fairbanks, Sterling, Monterey, Reno, and
   Davenport. LAPS is also being implemented at various U.S. government
   agencies such as AFWA, Range Standardization and Augmentation (RSA) at
   the U.S. Space Centers, National Ocean Service, and for international
   government weather bureaus such as China, Italy, Taiwan, Thailand, and
   Korea.

LAPS Software:

   LAPS Analysis software may be downloaded in the form of a "gzipped" tar
   file, available to our list of users. Users may also obtain a Colorado
   test data case to check how well your implementation of the code is
   running. We have posted our most recent LAPS release from 1/14/2002.
   Hints on how to install and run LAPS Analysis software are contained in
   the README file.
