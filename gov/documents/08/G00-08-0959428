     Welcome to the Lunar Prospector Web Page at the Los Alamos National
                                 Laboratory.

   At Los Alamos we have built the three spectrometers which are currently
   taking measurements around the Moon from the Lunar Prospector (LP)
   Spacecraft. Since LP launch on January 6, 1998, we are reducing and
   analyzing data from the Gamma-Ray Spectrometer, from the Neutron
   Spectrometer and from the Alpha Particle Spectrometer.

   You will find here information about the Lunar Prospector Spectrometers
     and the latest available results. You will also be able to view and
                            download data files.
