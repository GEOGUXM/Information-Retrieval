                                 Description

   Swiss-PdbViewer is an application that provides a user friendly
   interface allowing to analyse several proteins at the same time. The
   proteins can be superimposed in order to deduce structural alignments
   and compare their active sites or any other relevant parts. Amino acid
   mutations, H-bonds, angles and distances between atoms are easy to
   obtain thanks to the intuitive graphic and menu interface.

   Moreover, Swiss-PdbViewer is tightly linked to Swiss-Model, an
   automated homology modelling server developped at Glaxo Welcome
   Experimental Research in Geneva.

   Working with these two programs greatly reduces the amount of work
   necessary to generate models, as it is possible to thread a protein
   primary sequence onto a 3D template and get an immediate feedback of
   how well the threaded protein will be accepted by the reference
   structure before submitting a request to build missing loops and refine
   sidechain packing.

   Swiss-PdbViewer can also read electron density maps, and provides
   various tools to build into the density.

   In addition, various modelling tools are integrated and command files
   for popular energy minimisation packages can be generated.

   Finally, as a special bonus, POV-Ray scenes can be generated from the
   current view in order to make stunning ray-traced quality images. An
   example can be found here .
