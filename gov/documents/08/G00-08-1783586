   Welcome!

   [trafficmgt.jpg] The Office of Metropolitan Planning and Programs has
   developed this web site as a resource for State and local
   transportation planning agencies.

   The goal of this web site is to guide and inform transportation
   planners on effective ways to consider management and operations
   investments, programs and actions in planning contexts.
   It provides a document library that may be searched for relevant recent
   documents that deal with this subject and also presents a forum for the
   exchange of plannersÂ’ experiences.
