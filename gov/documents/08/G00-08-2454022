                            Digital Earth Initiative

   The Digital Earth is a virtual representation of our planet that
   enables a person to explore and interact with the vast amounts of
   natural and cultural information gathered about the Earth.

   The Digital Earth Initiative (DEI) is an ad hoc inter-agency working
   group to define the US federal participation in DE. This website
   records the deliberations of that group. The public Digital Earth site
   is at http://www.digitalearth.gov/.
