     The Smart Systems Research Laboratory (SSRL) in the Computational
     Sciences Division at NASA Ames Research Center develops innovative
     software solutions and tools for space and medicine. Our projects
     share the common goal of utilizing our advanced soft computing
     techniques to achieve "smart" operation resulting in improved
     performance.

     While the core of our projects is the development of cutting edge
     software, our projects have associated hardware prototype
     implementations that serve as experimental testbeds. One of this
     lab's goals is the ability to apply the software on the hardware
     testbeds to demonstrate proof-of-concept.
