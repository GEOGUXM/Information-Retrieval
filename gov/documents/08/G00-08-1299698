     Welcome to the Arkin Laboratory for quantitative biology. We are
     interested in developing a physically-based engineering discipline
     for cellular and multicellular systems. Such a discipline will lead
     to a deeper understanding of cellular regulation and development,
     more efficient discovery of cellular networks, and a better ability
     to engineer or control cells for industrial or medical purposes. To
     this end we develop and apply mathematical theory, computational and
     experimental approaches to analysis of cellular function.

     Techniques employed by the laboratory include:
     * Physical chemistry and modeling of cellular milieu including gene
       expression, enzymology, transport and mechanics
     * Theory of chemical, biochemical, and genetic networks. Discovery
       and characterization of regulatory motifs.
     * Dynamical system, control and stochastic process theory applied to
       biological networks
     * Database and knowlege-base creation, curation and mining
     * Functional sequence and structure analysis
     * Statistical data analysis: microarrays, proteomics, metabolite
       profiling, imaging
     * Learning models from data
     * Engineering analysis and simulation of multiscale, multiresolution
       biological systems
     * Collaboratory software for biological data analysis and simulation
     * Design and implementation complex gene expression networks in cells
     * Design and implementation of molecular and cellular biosensors
       To learn more please cruise about the web site. You will find
       descriptions of research projects and laboratory personnel, as well
       as repositories of public data and lab-developed software,
       manuscripts and working documents. Contact information is at the
       bottom of every page.
