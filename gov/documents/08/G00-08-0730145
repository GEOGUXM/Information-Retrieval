                                   Mission

   The Environmental Modeling Center (EMC, formerly the Development
   Division), improves numerical weather, marine and climate predictions
   at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP, formerly
   the National Meteorological Center), through a broad program of
   research in data assimilation and modeling. In support of the NCEP
   operational forecasting mission, the EMC develops, improves and
   monitors data assimilation systems and models of the atmosphere, ocean
   and coupled system, using advanced methods developed internally as well
   as cooperatively with scientists from Universities, NOAA Laboratories
   and other government agencies, and the international scientific
   community.
