   A Draft National Strategy to Restore Estuarine Habitat

   ""

   Restore America's Estuaries (RAE), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration's (NOAA) National Ocean Service and National Marine
   Fisheries Service are working with state and federal agencies,
   non-profit organizations, scientists and others to develop a National
   Strategy to Restore Coastal Habitat: Restoring America's Estuaries.
   This draft Strategy represents a comprehensive approach to maximize the
   benefits derived from habitat restoration projects and to foster the
   coordination of federal and non-federal activities related to
   restoration of coastal habitat. It seeks to ensure that restoration
   priorities are established, diverse programs are coordinated to
   maximize benefits, and public expectations are both established and
   met.

   The goal of the National Strategy to Restore Coastal Habitat: Restoring
   America's Estuaries is to restore function to one million acres of
   estuary habitat by 2010.
