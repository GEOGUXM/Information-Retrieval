               Senate Foreign Relations Committee - Democrats

   Senator Joseph Biden - Chairman Welcome to the Foreign Relations
   Committee Majority Home Page!

   I invite you to have a look around at some of the events and foreign
   policies that are making a difference in the lives of American citizens
   and people around the world.

   No foreign policy can be sustained without the informed consent of the
   American people. Our government works best when citizens care enough to
   become involved. I hope this web site provides you with useful and
   valuable information--and that it sparks a desire to learn more and to
   become a full partner in our American democracy.

   Happy browsing!
