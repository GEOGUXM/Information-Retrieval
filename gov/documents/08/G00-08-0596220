   FOCUS is a heavy-flavor photoproduction experiment located in the Wide
   Band Area of Fermilab. It is an upgraded version of its predecessor,
   E687.

   The experiment accumulated data during the 1996-1997 fixed target run
   and has fully reconstructed more than one million charm particles using
   the `golden mode' decays, D^0 --> K^- pi^+, D^0 --> K^- pi^+ pi^- pi^+,
   and D^+ --> K^- pi^+ pi^+.

   Current analysis efforts include:
     * high precision studies of charm semileptonic decays
     * detailed Dalitz analyses of several charm meson decay channels
     * QCD studies using charm pair events
     * a measurement of the absolute branching fractions for the D^0 meson
     * spectroscopy of excited charm mesons

     * studies of several doubly Cabibbo supressed decays
     * a systematic investigation of charm baryon masses, branching
       fractions, widths, and lifetimes
     * searches for D^0 mixing, CP violation, rare and forbidden decays
     * fully leptonic decays of the D^+
