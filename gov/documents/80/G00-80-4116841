   Walden Applauds Enterprise Zone Designation for Prineville / Crook County

Designation will assist Prineville and Crook County economic development

   WASHINGTON, D.C. U.S. Congressman Greg Walden (R-OR) today applauded
   the designation of Prineville / Crook County as an Enterprise Zone by
   the Oregon Economic and Community Development Department.  Enterprise
   Zone status offers tax exemptions for local businesses in economically
   depressed Oregon communities to attract new investment and allow
   existing businesses to grow.  The City of Prineville and Crook County
   submitted a joint application for Enterprise Zone designation and have
   developed a joint management agreement to coordinate economic
   development projects.  Congressman Walden wrote a letter of support for
   the Prineville / Crook County Enterprise Zone application in November
   of 2001.

   Im extremely pleased that Prineville has been designated as an
   Enterprise Zone, said Walden. This new status will give the good people
   of Prineville and Crook County a greater ability to attract new
   business investment in the area and expand the businesses that are
   already in place.  The economic woes facing the rest of the nation
   right now have been with the people of Prineville for the better part
   of a decade.  With the closing of the lumber mill and the loss of
   family wage jobs in the area, its more important than ever to promote
   community development projects here to revitalize the community.  This
   Enterprise Zone will offer incentives for businesses to invest in Crook
   County, and Im delighted I was able to play a small role in helping to
   secure this vital designation.

   Enterprise Zones were created by the Oregon Legislature in 1985 in an
   effort to spur economic growth in economically depressed areas of the
   state.  Among the new designations announced by the Oregon Economic and
   Community Development Department today is an Enterprise Zone in Gilliam
   County, which Congressman Walden also represents.

   Congressman Walden represents the Second Congressional District of
   Oregon, which includes the 20 counties of southern, central and eastern
   Oregon. Rep. Walden is a member of the House Energy and Commerce
   Committee and The House Committee on Resources
