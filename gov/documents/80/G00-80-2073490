Education and Public Outreach Activities at the HEASARC

   The HEASARC provides a number of facilities for students, educators,
   and the general public to learn more about the universe. The general
   public and students from elementary school to college age will find
   informative material on topics ranging from the solar system to black
   holes to distant galaxies. Education materials for teachers include
   activities and lesson plans which use concepts and data from high
   energy astrophysics in interdisciplinary lessons appropriate for math
   and science classes. Scientists will also find materials and images for
   their use in presentations before a variety of audiences.

   Links to the left will take you to pages discussing a wide variety of
   astronomy topics. Mission Learning Centers, listed on the right, will
   take you to pages with information and education resources focused on a
   particular high energy astrophysics mission.

   Here are some brief descriptions of the links to the left.
     * Imagine!: Ages 14 - adult, with a special area for educat ors. Our
       Universe... what we know about it, how it is evolving, and the
       kinds of objects and phenomena it contains. Also, how scientists
       know wh at we know, what mysteries remain, and how we might one day
       find the ans wers to these questions.
     * StarChild: Level 1: Ages 6-10, Level 2: Ages 10-14: Information and
       activities about The Solar Sytem, The Universe, Space Stuff, and a
       Glossary
     * Ask a Scientist: All ages: Have a question? Read the archive
       available at this site, and feel free to ask your own question.
     * Cosmic Distances: All ages: How big is our universe? Discover the
       cosmic distances sparating us from the nearest stars to the
       furthest galaxies.
     * WebStars: All ages: This list of astronomical resource sites is
       intended for users who may have only a general interest in
       astronomical topics.
     * APOD: All ages: Discover the cosmos! Each day a different image or
       photograph of our fascinating universe is featured, along with a
       brief explanation written by a professional astronomer.
     * HEAPOW: All ages: Each week the HEASARC scours the archive of X-ray
       and Gamma Ray observations to bring you new, exciting and beautiful
       images.
     * Image Archive: College and above: These pages diplay and discuss
       the many objects we see in our universe. The emphasis is on high
       energy astrophysics data. There are also images and information
       from past and current high-energy astrophysics missions.
     * Video Archive: All ages: Educational and historical videos, as well
       as videos about specific missions.

Mission Learning Centers

     The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Learning Center - Ages: Upper High
   School to adult
   What does RXTE do? This site introduces the concepts of X-ray
       astronomy, provides data and lesson plans, includes descriptions of
       discoveries RXTE has made, images and movies, and has a model of
       RXTE that can be printed and put together.

     The XMM-Newton Learning Center - Ages 14 - adult
   How does XMM-Newton work, and what does it do? Starting from the
       basics, this site explains the instruments and the scientific goals
       of XMM-Newton. This learning center also contains educational
       resources for teachers.
