   [h.gif] urricanes are severe tropical storms that form in the southern
   Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and in the eastern
   Pacific Ocean. Hurricanes gather heat and energy through contact with
   warm ocean waters. Evaporation from the seawater increases their power.

   THINGS TO KNOW Hurricanes rotate in a counter-clockwise direction
   around an "eye." Hurricanes have winds at least 74 miles per hour. When
   they come onto land, the heavy rain, strong winds and heavy waves can
   damage buildings, trees and cars. The heavy waves are called a storm
   surge. Storm surges are very dangerous and a major reason why you MUST
   stay away from the ocean during a hurricane warning or hurricane.
