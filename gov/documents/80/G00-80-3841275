                            The BOREAS Follow-on

   The BOREAS Follow-on is a collection of data sets containing additional
   information from the BOREAS Project. There is additional flux data (for
   1997 to 1999), GOES imagery, and other ascillary data recorded or
   processed after the end of the original BOREAS Project. These data are
   stored on 18 CD-ROMs.

                             The BOREAS Project

   The Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) was a large-scale
   international interdisciplinary climate-ecosystem interaction
   experiment in the northern boreal forests of Canada. Its goal was to
   improve our understanding of the boreal forests -- how they interact
   with the atmosphere, how much CO[2] they can store, and how climate
   change will affect them. BOREAS wanted to learn to use satellite data
   to monitor the forests, and to improve computer simulation and weather
   models so scientists can anticipate the effects of global change.
         The BOREAS Project had four years of field studies.
   Infrastructure setup and trial studies began in 1993, a full year of
   field campaigns was held in 1994, a small interum monitoring program
   was in place in 1995, and there was more field study in 1996. Read an
   in-depth description of the BOREAS Field Campaigns. Click here to order
   the original BOREAS data on a 12 CD-ROM set.

   The BOREAS Follow-on
         The BOREAS Follow-on (also called the Guest Investigator Program)
   began in 1997 with an additional call for proposals to permit more
   integrative, inter-disciplinary, regional-scale analyses focused on
   broader scientific questions. This resulted in the selection of
   thirteen Follow-on investigations. These investigations focus generally
   on modeling and analysis, extending and building on the BOREAS
   scientific results and existing data. The BOREAS Follow-on has 13
   science teams broken up into the following groups:

     * Overview of the BOREAS Follow-on Science Groups
          + Derived Surface Parameters (DSP)
          + Flux (FLX)
          + Hydro-Meteorology (HMet)
          + Carbon Modelers (MOD)

   The BOREAS Study Region
         The large-scale study area for BOREAS was a 1000 x 1000 km area
   covering most of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada -- called the BOREAS
   Study Region. Within that region were two specific study areas -- the
   Northern Study Area (NSA) in Thompson Manitoba, and the Southern Study
   Area (SSA) in Prince Albert Saskatchewan.
