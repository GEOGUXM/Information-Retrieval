   * Total Term is from the date of authorization until final repayment.

   It is agreed that pursuant to the provisions of Ex-Im Bank loans and
   guarantees and Ex-Im Bank export credit insurance policies, the country
   limitation schedule has been amended effective October 29, 2001. This
   revision supersedes the April 1, 2001 Country Limitation Schedule and
   any amendments thereto.

   Insureds and brokers will be notified of any amend-ments to this
   country limitation schedule in writing. A full revision is generally
   completed every six months to one year. All special conditions should
   be reviewed as many have been amended.

   GENERAL CONDITIONS

   Exceptions to any condition or limitation contained herein must be
   obtained in writing from Ex-Im Bank.

   Ex-Im Bank reserves the right to set additional conditions for any
   particular buyer or issuing bank including the right to set a different
   percentage of coverage. Ex-Im Bank also reserves the right to reject
   any particular application.

   The sector where the risk lies (public or private) and the country of
   the obligor, or guarantor if there is one, will generally be used for
   determining appropriate country limitations and fees.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The following insurance policies are affected by this country
   limitation schedule. Please note that Short-Term Insurance Policies are
   governed by the columns titled "Up to one year":

   Short-Term Insurance Policies: EBD, ELC, ENB, ENV, ESC, ESM(ST), ESS,
   ETM(ST), EUS, FB, FB-E, FV, ESP, ESSP, FP, MCP(ST).

   Medium-Term: All medium-term and lease-policy types, ESM, ETM, MCP,
   MRP, MSC, MSC-E, MTR, MTR-E.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Notes:

   #1. Discretionary Credit Limits under Short Term Insurance Policies are
   withdrawn. Cover not available unless specified in a Special Buyer
   Credit Limit endorsement, an Issuing Bank Credit Limit endorsement, or
   a Country Limit of Liability endorsement.

   #2. Currently, arrangements are in place with the Bank of China and the
   State Development Bank to serve as obligor or guarantor for medium and
   long-term transactions under the Loan and Guarantee Programs. For the
   Medium-Term Insurance, Loan or Guarantee Programs, Ex-Im Bank will
   consider transactions with other financial institutions or other
   entities that are able to provide detailed financial information
   sufficient to enable Ex-Im Bank to reach a credit conclusion.

   Under short-term insurance policies for public sector transactions, the
   use of Discretionary Credit Limits and Country Limits of Liability
   requires the obligation of one of the following: the Bank of China, the
   State Development Bank, the China Construction Bank, the Industrial and
   Commercial Bank of China, or the Bank of Communications. For private
   sector transactions, Discretionary Credit Limits are not available, and
   cover is not available unless specified in a Special Buyer Credit Limit
   endorsement or an Issuing Bank Credit Limit endorsement.

   Coverage under the Working Capital Guarantee Program (WCGP) requires
   that the transaction be supported by an irrevocable Letter of Credit
   issued by a bank referenced in the immediately preceding paragraph, or
   by a bank pre-approved by Ex-Im Bank. Exceptions may be made for
   private sector transactions that are insured for comprehensive
   political and economic risk.

   #3. Prior to accepting an application for a preliminary or final
   commitment for a public sector transaction, or for any insurance or
   WCGP coverage for a public sector transaction, Ex-Im Bank will require
   an indication of host government support for the application. Contact
   Ex-Im Bank for more detailed information on specific markets.

   #4. Ex-Im Bank cover/support for short and medium-term private sector
   transactions is typically limited to transactions with a commercial
   bank as obligor or guarantor unless otherwise specified by Ex-Im Bank.
   Coverage under the WCGP for private sector transactions requires that
   the transaction be supported by an irrevocable Letter of Credit.

   #5. Ex-Im Bank cover/support for public sector transactions is
   typically limited to transactions which commit the full faith and
   credit of the government.

   #6. Under Short-Term Insurance Policies, coverage under Discretionary
   Credit Limits and a Country Limits of Liability shall be the lesser of
   the limits authorized in the policy or:

         a. $50,000

         b. $100,000

   Higher limits will be considered upon application for a Special Buyer
   Credit Limit endorsement, an Issuing Bank Credit Limit endorsement, or
   Country Limits of Liability endorsement.

   #7. Support legally prohibited.

   #8. Public sector transactions in Sharjah, Fujairah, Ras Al-Khaimah,
   Umm Al-Qaywayn, and Ajman require the guarantee of the federal
   government of the United Arab Emirates. Coverage under the WCGP for
   public sector transactions for the above may be considered if supported
   by an irrevocable Letter of Credit.

   #9. Sovereign transactions with total term in excess of one (1) year
   require the Government of Aruba as the borrower. For the WCGP, a
   transaction may also be considered eligible if it is supported by an
   irrevocable Letter of Credit.

   #10. When open for cover, medium- and long-term public sector
   transactions are subject to Ministry of Finance notification to Ex-Im
   Bank that the transaction is of the highest priority and would conform
   with IMF program limits on non-concessional debt.

   #11. Support for the Republika Srpska is legally prohibited. Note 13
   applies to the Federation of Bosnia and Hercegovina only.

   #12. Support for Serbia is legally prohibited. Notes# 1,4 and 13
   applies to Montenegro only.

   #13. Where closed for certain routine trade finance transactions, Ex-Im
   Bank will consider structured financing arrangements such as Ex-Im
   Bank's project finance program, asset-based aircraft leases, and other
   financing arrangements that offer a reasonable assurance of repayment,
   including reliable access to adequate foreign exchange.

   In addition, coverage under the WCGP may be available for a transaction
   that is supported by an irrevocable Letter of Credit issued by a bank,
   and/or due from a Buyer, located in a country where Ex-Im Bank is open
   without restrictions for short-term transactions.

   #14a. Public sector risk cover is available under Ex-Im Bank's Africa
   Pilot Program. Discretionary Credit Limits are withdrawn. Full faith
   and credit of the government is typically required (including coverage
   of public sector transactions under the WCGP). Exceptions may be made
   for transactions which are in conformance with the Africa Pilot
   Program's Credit Standards.

        b. Private sector risk cover is available under Ex-Im Bank's
   Africa Pilot Program. Discretionary Credit Limits are withdrawn. A
   commercial bank as obligor or guarantor is typically required.
   Exceptions may be made for transactions which are in conformance with
   the Africa Pilot Program's Credit Standards.

   Coverage of a private sector transaction under the WCGP requires that
   the transaction be supported by an irrevocable Letter of Credit or by
   the guarantee of a commercial bank. Exceptions may be made for
   transactions which are in conformance with the Africa Pilot Program's
   Credit Standards.

   #15a. As a result of existing conditions in this market, Ex-Im Bank is
   currently not processing applications in the public sector. Coverage
   under the WCGP for public sector transactions is currently not
   available.

        b. As a result of existing conditions in this market, Ex-Im Bank
   is currently not processing applications in the private sector.
   Coverage under the WCGP for private sector transactions is currently
   not available.

   INFORMATION SUPPLEMENT ON
   MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM PROGRAMS
   "Open for Cover" versus "Off-Cover." The attached Country Limitation
   Schedule indicates where Ex-Im Bank is "open for cover" and where Ex-Im
   Bank is "off-cover." The Schedule is organized along three dimensions:
   the country where the risk lies, sector (public sector or private
   sector), and term of total exposure (including both disbursement period
   and repayment term). Ex-Im Bank defines "public sector" as including
   those obligors or guarantors which are at least 50% owned, directly or
   indirectly, by the government. Where the CLS presents an X mark, Ex-Im
   Bank is "off-cover," and is therefore not willing to consider approval
   of routine transactions. These "off-cover" determinations are due to
   economic and/or political risks associated with the country.
   Where Ex-Im Bank is Open for Cover. The "open for cover" designation
   refers to the possibility, rather than the certainty, of Ex-Im Bank
   support in particular cases. Proposed obligors, guarantors, and
   transaction structures under medium- and long-term programs are all
   subject to case-by-case Ex-Im Bank approval. Approval depends on the
   case-by-case application of Ex-Im Bank policies, particularly the Ex-Im
   Bank's determination of reasonable assurance of repayment. The
   following paragraphs provide very general guidance to the application
   of policies in markets where Ex-Im Bank is on-cover.

     * Identification of Obligor or Guarantor. Ex-Im Bank will approve a
       final commitment, a preliminary commitment (PC), or a medium-term
       insurance policy or commitment (MTIP or MTIC), only if a specific
       obligor or guarantor has been identified. Ex-Im Bank may approve an
       indicative letter of interest (LI) for a proposed transaction,
       subject to the condition that an obligor or guarantor is identified
       at the time the LI is converted to a final commitment, PC, MTIP, or
       MTIC; and Ex-Im Bank can accept the credit risk of the proposed
       obligor or guarantor.
     * Information Requirements regarding Obligors or Guarantors. Ex-Im
       Bank requires that obligors or guarantors offer "reasonable
       assurance of repayment." To process applications for final
       commitments, PCs, MTIPs, and MTICs, Ex-Im Bank will first require
       information on proposed obligors and guarantors. Such information
       includes financial statements and credit references. Engineering
       data is required for long-term transactions. Generally, Ex-Im Bank
       will require more detailed information regarding obligors or
       guarantors when processing relatively large transactions, or
       transactions with obligors or guarantors with which Ex-Im Bank has
       had no favorable direct credit experience. Ex-Im Bank's application
       form and program literature specify the Bank's standard information
       requirements.
     * Sovereign Guarantees for Public Sector Buyers or Obligors. For
       cases involving proposed public sector buyers or obligors which do
       not have significant independent sources of revenue outside the
       central government budget and which do not have independently
       audited financial statements, Ex-Im Bank will routinely require a
       sovereign guarantee.
     * Prior Evidence of Host Government Willingness to Provide Sovereign
       Guarantee in Some Countries. In some countries, Ex-Im Bank requires
       applications for a final commitment for a medium- or long-term loan
       or guarantee, or for medium-term insurance, to be accompanied by
       prior evidence of the host government's willingness to provide a
       sovereign guarantee.
     * Temporary Suspension of Cover. In countries where the CLS indicates
       that Ex-Im Bank is "open for cover," Ex-Im Bank may, under certain
       circumstances, temporarily suspend cover. This is most likely to be
       the case for public sector obligors and guarantors only, but may
       involve all obligors and guarantors. In such an event, Ex-Im Bank
       will advise applicants as quickly as possible.
     * Large Transactions in Smaller Markets. Relatively large
       transactions in smaller economies, even when sovereign guaranteed,
       will be subject to special Ex-Im Bank review. Ex-Im Bank will
       review the potential macroeconomic impacts of the transaction, in
       terms of higher debt burden and debt repayment capacity.
     * Private Companies. Ex-Im Bank will accept the direct credit risks
       of private buyers, if available information suggests that these
       buyers offer a "reasonable assurance of repayment." For
       closely-held companies, Ex-Im Bank may require financial
       information from owners. For holding companies, Ex-Im Bank may
       require financial information on operating components, and may
       require their counter-guarantee.
     * Commercial Bank Guarantees. Ex-Im Bank may require the guarantees
       of acceptable commercial banks in the event that information
       available to Ex-Im Bank on proposed private buyers suggests that
       these buyers by themselves do not offer a "reasonable assurance of
       repayment."
     * Limited Recourse Projects. Ex-Im Bank will consider
       limited-recourse project finance structures (those without full
       recourse to an acceptable, established obligor or guarantor), but
       only after a comprehensive review of project features. These
       features shall include the financial commitment of the project's
       equity shareholders over the life of the proposed Ex-Im Bank
       commitment; the experience and capacity of project participants,
       including suppliers and offtakers; project cash flow coverage of
       foreign currency debt service; and security structures, including
       hard currency external payments arrangements. Ex-Im Bank will
       review only well-developed proposals, and will require project
       sponsors to fund review of project proposals by consultants
       retained by the Bank. Significant changes to proposed structures
       may be required.
     * Political-Only Cover. Ex-Im Bank's standard guarantee and insurance
       cover is "comprehensive," under which Ex-Im Bank will pay claims
       resulting from both commercial and political perils. For private
       borrowers, Ex-Im Bank also offers a narrower form of coverage,
       under "political-only" cover. Ex-Im Bank's guarantee agreements and
       insurance policies describe in detail and/or define the specific
       risks which are subject to this form of coverage.

   The following is intended as a summary: For long-term transactions,
   Ex-Im Bank covers default arising from four "core" perils: transfer
   risk, expropriation, U.S. export license risk and political violence.
   Transfer risk involves borrowers' inability to acquire foreign exchange
   through legal foreign exchange markets. Expropriation involves the
   government's confiscation of assets or ownership, or arbitrary or
   discriminatory intervention in business operations. U.S. export license
   rie rinvolves the cancellation or non-renewal of a U.S. export license
   or imposition of certain restrictions on such license after shipment.
   Political violence involves war, revolution, insurrection, and other
   such acts. Under medium-term insurance policies, Ex-Im Bank also covers
   defaults arising from other defined risks.

   Suppliers and/or lenders choosing political-only cover must be prepared
   to assume broad commercial risks associated with the borrower's
   capacity. Ex-Im Bank's political-only cover does not cover defaults
   arising from the borrower's capacity to withstand domestic or
   international commercial market disruptions, or currency devaluation or
   depreciation. If suppliers and/or lenders are unable to assume these
   and other commercial risks, then Ex-Im Bank comprehensive cover would
   be a more appropriate form of coverage.

   Political-only cover is offered only for private buyers or borrowers,
   those which are not subject to the administration of government
   authorities, and for which it is possible to distinguish between
   commercial perils and political-risk perils. Political-only cover is
   not available for guaranteed lenders that are majority-owned or
   controlled by the host country government. Political-only cover is the
   only form of coverage available from Ex-Im Bank for borrowers which are
   effectively controlled by suppliers and/or lenders participating in
   transactions. Political-only cover is available only in those countries
   where Ex-Im Bank is "open for cover" for private sector risk.

   Where Ex-Im Bank is Off Cover for Country Credit Reasons. Ex-Im Bank
   will not consider routine transactions in countries and sectors (public
   or private) where the country limitation schedule indicates that the
   Bank is off-cover (where there is an X). However, four special
   categories of transactions may be eligible for Ex-Im Bank support,
   under restrictive conditions, subject to additional special review:

     * Borrowers on International Capital Markets. Individual borrowers
       (either public sector or private sector) with a strong record of
       independent access or those borrowers which in Ex-Im Bank's opinion
       could have access to private international capital markets or other
       international sources of funds, absent external (including
       sovereign) guarantees. The fee grade assigned, and the extent of
       Ex-Im Bank support, will take into account information related to
       the borrower's financings and ratings. For Ex-Im Bank to consider
       such borrowers, information on the borrower's international
       borrowings for at least the last six months must accompany the
       application. For each traded debt security, the required
       information includes the maturity and coupon, credit ratings (if
       any), and recent yield data. For syndicated loans, the required
       information includes interest rates, arranging fees, maturity
       profile, amounts borrowed, and names of arranging and key
       participating banks.
     * Insulated Project Finance Structures. Ex-Im Bank's approval in
       "off-cover" markets/sectors of limited-recourse structures depends
       on the establishment of structures which do not require the
       financial or operating commitments of host government agencies and
       which are effectively insulated from government involvement.
       Furthermore, these structures must involve the channeling of
       project foreign exchange earnings through offshore payments and
       escrow mechanisms. In some country environments, the only
       acceptable limited-recourse structures may be "enclave" projects
       which are almost completely insulated from the broader country
       environment. The fee grade assigned, and the extent of Ex-Im Bank
       support, will take into account project structure and other
       conditions.
     * Secured Long-Range Aircraft Leases. Ex-Im Bank approval of
       asset-secured long-range aircraft lease transactions requires that
       the airline's country of registry become a signatory to
       international conventions protecting aircraft property rights.
       Ex-Im Bank approval for aircraft transactions in off-cover markets
       is more likely for privately-owned airlines with established
       operating records. Depending on the nature of transaction
       participants and structures, Ex-Im Bank may also require offshore
       payments and escrow mechanisms, or may provide a reduced percentage
       of cover. Aircraft transactions are subject to special fees and
       covenants.
     * Acceptable Borrower Outside the Country. Support may be available
       if an acceptable financial institution (e.g., commercial or
       multinational bank) outside of the country acts as the obligor.

   It should be noted that these exceptions do not apply in countries
   where Ex-Im Bank is legally prohibited from operating.
