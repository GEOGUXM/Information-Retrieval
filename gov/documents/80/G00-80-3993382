    The National Weather Service Mission

   The National Weather Service provides weather, hydrologic, and climate
   forecasts and warnings for the United States, its territories, adjacent
   waters and ocean areas, for the protection of life and property and the
   enhancement of the national economy. NWS data and products form a
   national information database and infrastructure which can be used by
   other governmental agencies, the private sector, the public, and the
   global community. It is accomplished by providing warnings and
   forecasts of hazardous weather, including thunderstorms, flooding,
   hurricanes, tornadoes, winter weather, tsunamis, and climate events.
   The NWS is the sole United States OFFICIAL voice for issuing warnings
   during life-threatening weather situations.
