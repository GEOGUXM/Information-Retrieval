  Assembly Bill 1770 (Papan) -- Bill information at Legislative Counsel's
  website

   Would implement the Commission's recommendation on Evidence of
   Prejudgment Deposit Appraisal in Eminent Domain.

   Summary: This recommendation would revise the statutes governing
   evidence of the condemnor's prejudgment deposit appraisal in order to:

     (1) Codify case law that evidence of the prejudgment deposit
     appraisal may be used for purposes of impeaching a witness who
     prepared the appraisal.

     (2) Emphasize that the protections against use of prejudgment
     deposit appraisal evidence apply equally to the property owner and
     the condemnor.

     (3) Make clear that evidence of the prejudgment deposit may be used
     in determining the amount of litigation expenses for which a
     condemnor may be assessed.

  Assembly Bill 1784 (Harman) -- Bill information at Legislative Counsel's
  website

   Would implement the Commission's recommendation on Rules of
   Construction for Trusts and Other Instruments.

   Summary: The Law Revision Commission in this recommendation surveys the
   existing Probate Code rules of construction for wills, trusts, and
   other estate planning instruments. The rules have been criticized in
   recent years as being overly broad.

   The Commission concludes that several of the rules should be limited in
   their application. A number should be repealed because they restate the
   common law (but do so in an incomplete fashion), because they repeat
   other statutes, or because they unduly inhibit the ability of the court
   to ascertain the donor's intent.

   The Commission recommends further clarifications of existing statutes
   and improvements in terminology, and correction of statutes containing
   obsolete references to former law. The Commission has developed
   official Comments explaining the derivation of, and providing other
   relevant information concerning, the Probate Code rules of
   construction.

     downloading in Adobe Acrobat format in the Commission's FTP

  Senate Bill 1316 (Senate Judiciary Committee) -- Bill information at
  Legislative Counsel's website

   Would implement the Commission's tentative recommendation on Statutes
   Made Obsolete by Trial Court Restructuring.

   Summary: In the late 1990's, California's trial court system was
   substantially restructured through state funding of trial court
   operations, trial court unification, and reforms relating to trial
   court employment. As a result, hundreds of statutes are now obsolete.
   The Law Revision Commission proposes amendment or repeal of the
   obsolete provisions to reflect the restructuring of the trial court
   system.

   In addition to the numerous revisions proposed in this recommendation,
   other statutes require amendment or repeal but are not included here
   because stakeholders have not yet reached agreement on key issues,
   further research is necessary in light of the complexity of the law, or
   additional time is required to prepare appropriate revisions due to the
   sheer volume of statutory material involved. The Commission will
   continue its work on statutes made obsolete by trial court
   restructuring with the objective of recommending further clean up of
   the statutes from time to time.

     ** The tentative recommendation is available for downloading in
     Adobe Acrobat format in the Commission's FTP directory:
     TR-TrialCtRestruct.pdf (December 2001) -- 3.01 M, 722 pp.

  Senate Bill ___ (Ackerman) -- Bill information at Legislative Counsel's
  website

   Would implement the Commission's recommendation on Municipal
   Bankruptcy.

   Summary: The Law Revision Commission recommends a number of revisions
   to update California statutes authorizing bankruptcy filings by local
   public entities under Chapter 9 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Consistent with the approach historically taken in California, the
   general statute would authorize municipal bankruptcy filings to the
   full extent permissible under federal law, subject to any special
   statutory rules applicable to particular entities.

   The Commission studied broader substantive reforms, including proposals
   to require prefiling approval by the Governor or a governmental
   committee, and to provide for postfiling review by appropriate state
   authorities. However, there does not appear to be any general agreement
   on the best approach to reform, or even as to the need for additional
   protections or controls. Accordingly, the Commission is not
   recommending any broader substantive reforms at this time.

     ** A preprint edition of the recommendation is available for
     downloading in Adobe Acrobat format in the Commission's FTP
     directory: RECpp-MuniBankruptcy.pdf (November 2001) -- 44 K, 24 pp.

  Senate Bill ___ (Ackerman) -- Bill information at Legislative Counsel's
  website

   Would implement the Commission's recommendation on Debtor-Creditor Law:
   Technical Revisions.

   Summary: This recommendation addresses a number of technical issues
   identified by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department concerning
   procedures under the claim and delivery statute (Code Civ. Proc. §
   511.010 et seq.) and the Enforcement of Judgments Law (Code Civ. Proc.
   § 680.010 et seq.), both of which were enacted on Commission
   recommendation.

   The Law Revision Commission recommends making technical revisions to
   address the following issues: (1) determination of the amount of the
   defendant's release undertaking in claim and delivery where the
   plaintiff has not provided an undertaking, (2) disposition of exemption
   claims in enforcement of judgments where hearings are taken off
   calendar, (3) clarification of rules concerning stays pending final
   determination of exemption claims,and (4) notation of the final day to
   vacate premises under a writ of possession.

     ** A preprint edition of the recommendation is available for
     downloading in Adobe Acrobat format in the Commission's FTP
     directory: RECpp-DebtorCreditorTech.pdf (May 2001) -- 86 K, 20 pp.
