      New information is entered into WNC every government business day
    within 24-72 hours from the time of original publication or broadcast

   World News Connection (WNC) is an online news service, only accessible
   via the World Wide Web, that offers an extensive array of translated
   and English-language news and information. Particularly effective in
   its coverage of local media sources, WNC provides you with the power to
   identify what really is happening in a specific country or region.
   Compiled from thousands of non-U.S. media sources, the information in
   WNC covers significant socioeconomic, political, scientific, technical,
   and environmental issues and events.

   The material in WNC is provided to the National Technical Information
   Service (NTIS) by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), a
   U.S. government agency. For over 60 years, analysts from FBIS' domestic
   and overseas bureaus have monitored timely and pertinent open-source
   materials, including gray literature. Uniquely, WNC allows you to take
   advantage of the intelligence gathering experience of FBIS.

   The information is obtained from full text and summaries of newspaper
   articles, conference proceedings, television and radio broadcasts,
   periodicals, and non-classified technical reports. New information is
   entered into WNC every government business day. Generally, this
   information is available within 24-72 hours from the time of original
   publication or broadcast.

   Regional categories covered include:

                                       Central Eurasia China
                                       East Asia       Near East & South Asia
                                       East Europe     West Europe
                                       The Americas    Sub-Saharan Africa

   WNC is a valuable research tool for anyone who needs to monitor
   non-U.S. media sources. For a low monthly fee, WNC subscribers can
   conduct unlimited interactive searches and have the ability to set up
   automated searches known as "profiles". Users of all skill levels will
   be impressed by WNC's power and ease of use.
