                                     Services

   FSW Systems Management
   People providing FSW Systems Engineering and Management typically work
   for a flight project manager in the role of Software Manager to
   identify and resolve issues related to a FSW development activity. The
   Software Manager coordinates FSW technical products from the
   perspective of integrating the needs of all FSW customers and users.
   Perform as advocate to the FSW teams in regards to communication and
   resolution of technical issues. Issues typically relate to the FSW
   development process plus FSW requirements, flight hardware
   characteristics, ground system interfaces, intended operations
   interfaces, FSW testbed and FSW tools development,
   verification/validation of the FSW and budget/schedule/reporting
   accuracies. This service also supports pre-Phase A through Phase B FSW
   concept developments and flight data system definitions.

   FSW Specialist Validation Testing (SVT)
   FSW SVT is the process of analyzing FSW requirements; creating an
   end-to-end FSW test suite which exercises those requirements in an
   on-orbit, operational manner; and validating that the as-implemented
   FSW satisfies its requirements and meets on-orbit needs. SVT comprises
   a FSW analysis and system test program performed by test specialists
   who are not members of the FSW development team. SVT ensures that FSW
   requirements are met and that FSW operates as intended.

   On-orbit FSW Sustaining Engineering
   On-Orbit FSW Sustaining Engineering is the on-orbit analysis and
   possible modification of FSW for purposes of maintaining mission
   viability. On-orbit FSW modifications typically occur in response to
   changes in flight hardware characteristics, requests for new science
   options, and to ensure safe operations of the spacecraft.
