  Section on Neurocircuitry

    Leslie G. Ungerleider, Ph.D., Chief

   To better understand the cortical mechanisms mediating perception and
   memory, this section has been examining the functional areas that
   comprise visual association cortex in nonhuman primates and exploring
   their interconnections by the use of neuroanatomical tracing techniques
   in combination with physiological recording of neural activity. Future
   studies will pursue functional brain imaging studies of perception and
   memory in humans and parallel single-cell recording studies in awake,
   behaving monkeys. A major effort will be to determine how "top-down"
   influences of attention and memory affect perceptual processing.

  Section on Functional Brain Imaging

    James Haxby Ph.D., Section Chief

   This section investigates the human neural systems that mediate visual
   perception, attention, and memory in the intact brain with functional
   brain imaging. Positron emission tomography (PET) and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are used to measure precisely
   localized hemodynamic changes associated with the performance of
   selected visual perceptual and mnemonic tasks. These hemodynamic
   changes are indices of local changes in neural activity. Current
   research focuses on vision as a model system for understanding how the
   brain processes and retains information and how that processing is
   altered by experience.

  Section on Cognitive Neuropsychology

    Alex Martin, Ph.D, Section Chief

   This section is concerned with developing and testing models of how
   cognitive processes are mediated in the human brain. This is
   accomplished via studies of patients with brain injury and disease, and
   via studies of normal individuals using functional brain imaging
   modalities. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we have obtained evidence
   that priming, a form of implicit learning that is preserved in patients
   with amnesia and in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), is mediated
   by decreased neural activity in specific brain regions, whereas
   explicit memory is mediate by increased activity throughout the same
   brain network. In addition, using positron emission tomography we
   demonstrated that the medial region of the temporal lobe, an area known
   to play a critical role in establishing new memories, is automatically
   engaged whenever an event is experienced. Current research will
   continue to explore visual perception, language processes, memory and
   learning in the normal human brain using PET and MRI. In addition, in
   collaboration with the Geriatric Psychiatry Branch, NIMH, we will
   continue to study the breakdown of semantic knowledge and other forms
   of memory in patients with AD and in those at-risk for developing this
   form of dementia.

  Unit on Functional Imaging Methods (FIM)

    Peter Bandettini, Ph.D., Unit Chief

   The Unit on Functional Imaging Methods (FIM) in the Laboratory of Brain
   and Cognition has four themes, all aimed at increasing the utility and
   interpretability of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The
   first theme involves quantitative characterization of the neuronal,
   physiologic, and biophysical processes that contribute to blood
   oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) and perfusion-based contrast in
   fMRI. The second theme involves tailoring specific neuroscience
   questions to unique characteristics of fMRI processing and acquisition.
   The third theme involves the development of pulse sequences, hardware,
   and processing techniques toward the direction of increased fMRI
   utility. The fourth theme involves the exploration of the measurement
   and quantification of previously unmeasured neuronal or physiological
   processes by MRI.
