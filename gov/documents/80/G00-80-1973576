       Web-based Tools

          The links to the left are for various Web-based tools that assist
          scientists in their proposal efforts. The HEASARC provides these tools
          as a service to the scientific community.

       Tool Descriptions

            Bibliography - Query NED, SIMBAD, and ADS for bibliographic
       references

     Coordinate Converter - CoCo: Object location and coordinate converter

     Date Converter - Convert between Julian date formats and more
   recognizable date formats

     Energy Converter - Energy/frequency/wavelength converter

     nH - Determine galactic absorption by coordinates

     RPS - Remote Proposal System

     TOPbase - An on-line database of atomic data (energy levels, f-values
   and photoionisation cross sections) compiled by the Opacity Project

     Viewing - Determine possible viewing times for missions and objects

     WebPIMMS - Determine source flux or count rates

     WebSpec - Simulate spectral data for missions/instruments

     X-Ray Background - Calculate average X-ray background count rates
   from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey diffuse background maps

     xTime - Convert RXTE times to other time systems and formats and vice
 versa
