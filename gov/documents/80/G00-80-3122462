   You may provide information to the New York Field Office by sending
   e-mail to newyork@fbi.gov. If possible, please include your address and
   telephone number in addition to your e-mail address. Due to the high
   volume of mail we receive, we cannot respond to all messages.

   If the information you wish to provide pertains to an emergency
   situation, please contact us at (212) 384-1000. Although we check our
   e-mail frequently, we do not consider it to be an alternative to
   telephonic contact in emergency situations.

   Please place all the information you wish to include in the body of the
   message. We ask that at least, initially, you do not include
   attachments because varying file types, encoding/compression schemes,
   and operating systems sometimes makes viewing them difficult.

   If you are seeking information on FBI job opportunities within the New
     York metropolitan area, please follow the "Job Opportunities" link.
      Presently, we cannot respond to job inquiries over the Internet.
