Vita

   Ricardo J. Maqueda was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in March 1963.
   From 1981 to 1988 he studied Physics at the University of Buenos Aires
   where he received a "Licenciado en F&iacutesica" degree (similar to a
   MS degree) in June 1988. He then worked for the Argentine Atomic Energy
   Commission (CNEA) where he had done his thesis research. In December of
   1988 he was awarded a one year fellowship from CNEA to do his Ph.D. at
   the University of Washington in Seattle (USA) where he became a
   non-matriculated student in January 1989. In September 1990 he
   matriculated as student at the Nuclear Engineering Department of the
   University of Washington (UW). While at this University he worked on
   the Coaxial Slow Source experiment of the UW and on the Large s
   Experiment at STI Optronics, Bellevue, Washington. Upon obtaining his
   Ph.D. in November of 1993 he returned to Argentina where he taught at
   the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) and obtained (March 1995) a
   Postdoctoral Fellowship from UBA to work at the Plasma Physics
   Institute (College of Exact and Natural Sciences). On July 1995 he left
   his fellowship at UBA to become a Post-doctoral researcher at the Los
   Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico, USA.

   While at LANL Ricky has been working with the Magnetic Fusion Team
   (within the Plasma Physics P-24 Group) on the production of runaway
   electrons on the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) at the Princeton
   Plasma Physics Laboratory, on disruption statistics of TFTR plasmas, on
   the applicability of natural diamond as detectors for fusion neutrons,
   and designing an infrared periscope for C-MOD at the Plasma Fusion
   Center of MIT.

   Ricky is married to Claudia M. Aprea and has a daughter named Victoria
   (photo) (born Sept. 1992).
