   Carl Moyer Program
     __________________________________________________________________

              Incentives for Lower Emission Heavy Duty Engines


     The Carl Moyer Program, named after the late Dr. Carl Moyer in
     recognition of his work in the air quality field, provides grants
     for some or all of the incremental purchase costs of lower-emission
     heavy-duty engines. Heavy-duty diesel engines are significant
     sources of NOx, a smog-forming pollutant. The fine particulate
     matter exhaust from heavy-duty diesel engines is a toxic air
     contaminant. Recently adopted stringent emission standards for new
     heavy-duty engines will result in significant emission reductions
     over a period of years, as the standards become effective and new
     engines are brought into service. But the turnover to cleaner
     engines will take time, because old engines are usually rebuilt two
     or three times over their service lifetime. Retrofitting or
     replacing existing engines, and introducing new technology (like
     alternative fuels) in niche markets, can accelerate emission
     reductions from heavy duty engines.

      The determination of eligibility and the extent of individual
     incentives are governed by "The Carl Moyer Program Guidelines,"
     adopted on November 16, 2000 by the California Air Resources Board
     (ARB). The Program Guidelines are available below or from ARBÂ’s web
     site, http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/moyer/moyer.htm.

     The Air District has allocated out all available Carl Moyer Program
     Funds.  We currently anticipate that applications we will begin
     again accepting applications in January 2002.   The most recent
     Guidelines and Application forms are provided below for
     informational purposes only.  They are subject to change.  Please do
     not submit any applications at this time.
     Please contact Michael Murphy at mmurphy@baaqmd.gov or 415-749-4644
     with questions regarding the program.


                  Carl Moyer Program Inter-District Projects

     The Air Resources Board (ARB) is inviting all interested parties to
     apply for Carl Moyer Program Inter-District Project. Section 44286
     of the Health and Safety Code gives ARB the authority to reserve up
     to ten percent of the program's funding for qualifying projects
     operating in more than one district. ARB has set aside $501,750 for
     inter-district projects. This is a state-wide solicitation that is
     separate from the Bay Area local Carl Moyer Program described
     above.  Project proponents should apply directly to ARB.

     Applications may be submitted until 4:00 PM, February 15, 2002.
     Please submit all applications to:

     Ms. Rosalva Tapia

     Air Resources Board

     Mobile Source Control Division - North

     P.O. Box 2815

     Sacramento, CA 95812

     The Carl Moyer Program Inter-District Project Solicitation is
     available electronically on ARBs Website located at
     http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/moyer/moyer.htm.  If you would like a
     hard copy mailed to you, or have any questions pertaining to the
     application process detailed in the enclosure, please contact Ms.
