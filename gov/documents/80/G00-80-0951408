   A few years ago, I walked across the sidewalk of Kansas City's Union
   Station and searched for evidence of a tragic crime. However, I wasn't
   there to lift fingerprints and take photographs. It was not necessary
   because an investigation into the crime had already taken place -- six
   decades ago.

                                Union Station
                                Union Station

   I was there on an historical mission, to look for something that
   memorialized an event that shocked a nation and changed the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation forever.

   I stood on the spot of the Kansas City Massacre, which occurred over 60
   years before. I carry a somewhat obscure connection to the notorious
   crime because I am assigned FBI badge number 4920, the same badge that
   was once carried by FBI Agent Frank Smith.

   Smith had survived the barrage of bullets that killed four lawmen, a
   prisoner, and wounded two others. The carnage happened at the hands of
   "Pretty Boy" Floyd and two other hoodlums.

   The attack changed American attitudes about crime and law enforcement.
   It also had a dramatic influence on the evolution of the FBI as an
   organization and on its sphere of power and jurisdiction.

   On June 17, 1933, Union Station was an active, thriving landmark and
   centerpiece. It was a hub of transportation in middle America. However,
   at about 7:20 a.m., the station became an "arena of horror," according
   to an account in Kansas City's newspaper, The Star.

   Events leading to the massacre began the day before, when escaped
   convict Frank Nash was taken into custody in Hot Springs, Arkansas, by
   Smith and Joe Lackey, both agents of the Bureau of Investigation, which
   later became the FBI. They were assisted by Otto Reed, Police Chief in
   McAlister, Oklahoma.

   They escorted Nash to Kansas City by train, where he was to be
   transported in the car of agent Raymond Caffrey to Leavenworth
   Penitentiary. With Caffrey were Bureau agent Reed Vetterli and two
   Kansas City detectives, W.J. Grooms and Frank Hermanson.

   While the lawmen waited, Charles "Pretty Boy" Floyd, Vernon Miller, and
   Adam Richetti stood by, armed with machine guns and ready to free Nash.

   The train arrived on schedule at 7:15 a.m. and Nash was immediately
   taken to Caffrey's car. As the party was getting into the car, Floyd,
   Miller, and Richetti rushed forward. One shouted, "Up, up!" There was
   no time for the lawmen to reach for their weapons. The next order came
   quickly, "Let 'em have it!"

   The group fired relentlessly with machine guns from all sides of
   Caffrey's car. The result was truly a massacre.

   Grooms, Hermanson, Reed, and Caffrey were killed. Lackey and Vetterli
   were injured. Only Smith was unharmed. Ironically, Nash also was
   killed.

   The roar of gunfire on that Saturday morning at Union Station sent a
   shockwave across the country. The massacre caused an uproar in the
   political and law enforcement communities. It was a watershed in the
   public's opinion of crime and gangsterism, and served as a catalyst for
   law and order.

   The massacre triggered dramatic changes in the Bureau, a relatively
   small agency composed of investigators without the authority to carry
   firearms or make arrests. A young J. Edgar Hoover did not miss the
   opportunity created by public outrage and the demand for more effective
   law enforcement.

   The evolution was rapid. On May 18, 1934, less than a year later,
   President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law several statutes
   increasing the Bureau's jurisdiction. A month later, agents were given
   power of arrest and authority to carry firearms at all times. The
   agency, renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on July 1,
   1935, was given the mandate, power, and tools to fight gangster crime.

   Six months after the massacre, Vernon Miller was murdered by fellow
   mobsters in Detroit. In October of 1934, "Pretty Boy" Floyd was killed
   in a shoot-out with FBI Agents on a farm in Ohio. Adam Richetti was
   arrested in 1934 and, after a trial and conviction for murder, he was
   executed in the gas chamber at the Missouri State Penitentiary.

   Richetti's execution closed the case on the Kansas City Massacre. But
   60 years later, carrying the badge once assigned to Frank Smith, I
   viewed the physical evidence of one of the country's most notorious
   crimes.

   Smith came away from the attack unscathed. But some of the bullets that
   were meant for him and other lawmen made their mark on an outside wall
   of Union Station. The holes are still visible near the station's east
   entrance.

   The bullet holes will remain as an obscure, but enduring, memorial to
   the legacy and tragedy of the Kansas City Massacre.
