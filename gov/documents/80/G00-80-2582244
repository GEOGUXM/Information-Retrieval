                           Security Audit Program
    The Security Audit Program In 1997 the FTA began a voluntary transit
    security audit program. These audits are conducted at no cost for all
    sizes and types of transit systems. Security audit objectives are to:

     * Provide assistance to support the transit agencys development of a
       System Security Program Plan
     * Share "best practices" and "lessons learned"
     * Evaluate the quality of security provided to transit system
       passengers, employees, and facilities.
     * If your transit agency would like to participate in this very
       beneficial audit program, please e-mail us.
