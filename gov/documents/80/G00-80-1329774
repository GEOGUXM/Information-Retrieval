   Prediction of Majorana Project Sensitivity Craig Edward Aalseth
   University of South Carolina 501 S. Main St., Columbia, SC 29208 This
   is an ad-hoc calculation of the expected sensitivity of the proposed
   Majorana Project experiment. It extends previous experimental results
   obtained by the collaborating institutions to predict the effective
   neutrino mass limits reachable by the Majorana Project. Ground-State
   Transition First, the parameters of the proposed experiment are set
   forth. The germanium mass, M = 500 kg ; the run-time of the experiment,
   t = 10 yr; and the expected detector resolution at 2038 keV, FWHM = 3
   keV. The confidence level CL = 90 % will be used for the sensitivity
   limits. Previous experiments suggest[Bro95] a conservative background
   rate 1 bprevious = 0.20 . From this we may define a background rate for
   keV kg yr the Majorana Project using two reduction factors, discussed
   below: 1 1 1 b = b - previous , which gives b = 1.0 × 10 2 . 10 2 keV
   kg yr For bprevious , cosmogenic backgrounds from the germanium
   accounted for the total observed background in the region of interest
   near 2 MeV. This identification was possible by observing the intensity
   of 68Ga X-rays, allowing the intensity of the 68Ge beta spectrum to be
   known. The first factor, 1 , comes from the long 10 count-time of the
   experiment, allowing the 271-day half-life 68Ge to decay away, leaving
   the dominant background as internal 60Co, whose intensity is calculated
   to be 1 that of internal 68Ge. The second factor, 10 1 , comes from a
   conservative combination of factors: 2 * the count-time of the
   experiment and the 5.7-year half-life of 60Co. * self-shielding between
   adjacent detectors in the array, not explicitly modeled in this
   calculation. * conservative assumptions of pulse-shape discrimination
   (PSD) efficacy. Next, we calculate the number of active atoms: M 86 %
   6.02 1023 N = gm mol 75.49 mol This gives N = 3.429 1027 × atoms of
   76Ge. The atomic weight is adjusted for 86% enrichment. Now we can
   calculate an upper limit on number of 0 -decay events: FWHM An optimal
   energy window (single-sided) is 1.4 sigma: E = 1.4 , E = 1.784keV 2.354
   This will catch 77.5% of 0 -decay events. Now the total background, B:
   B = b E 2 M t This gives B = 178 counts. Now we find the largest total
   number of counts consistent with our stated confidence limit. L = ( , )
   This inverse cumulative probability gives C qpois CL B LC = 196
   counts[Cur68]. A check of the false-positive probability gives 1 -
   ppois(LC,B) = 8.9%, as expected. The integer nature of Poisson
   statistics prevents exact agreement with the desired confidence limit,
   this is a slightly conservative limit. The maximum number of candidate
   events consistent with a null measurement is then L - C C B = 77.5%
   giving C = 23 events. This number of candidate events corresponds to a
   "conventional" germanium experiment. The techniques of pulse-shape
   discrimination and detector segmentation allow the rejection of a
   substantial fraction of background events, with only a small loss in
   efficiency for events of interest. The efficacy of these techniques can
   be described by a figure-of-merit (FOM) of the form FOM = , where and
   background background are the acceptance fractions of the discriminator
   for double-beta decay events and background events, respectively. This
   FOM makes use of the dependence of the number of possible candidate
   events on the square root of the background and thus can be correctly
   used as a multiplier onto the standard expression for the resulting
   half-life limit, giving ln(2) N T t 0 = FOM . From our analysis of
   experimental C PSD results and Monte-Carlo segmentation results we
   have: 0.8018 0.907 FOM = , PSD FOM = and PSD 1.6 FOM = , seg FOMseg =
   2.4 0.2645 0.138 Page 2 Majorana Project Sensitivity Projection so the
   total effect is FOM = FOMPSD FOMseg, giving a total FOM = 3.806 . This
   gives a half-life limit for the experiment of: ln(2) N T t 0 = FOM , T

   Sensitivity Projection 0+ Excited-State Transition Using the same
   experimental parameters, the sensitivity resulting from observation of
   decay to the 0+ excited state may be projected. In this case, the
   expected background is essentially zero due to the coincidence
   requirements imposed. We further assume an experimental efficiency of
   50% for this process. This gives a half-life limit of ln(2) N 50% T t 0
