   Provisional Assessment of Hydrologic Conditions in Virginia
   December 6, 2001
   Recent lack of precipitation has caused streamflow across much of the
   State to decline well
   below the normal range for December. Streamflows are below the normal
   range in every
   major basin within the State and new record lows for December are being
   observed at gages
   in the York, James, and Roanoke River Basins.

   During the fall months, ET (evaporation and transpiration) and
   precipitation normally are low.
   Streamflows usually decline to their lowest levels in September or
   October with a slight increase
   in flow in November and December.  Therefore, the normal range of flow
   for November and
   December is greater than the normal range of flow for September and
   October.  Because
   streamflows have remained fairly constant and the normal range of flows
   has increased, current
   streamflows are statistically lower than they were in November, even
   though the flows are very
   similar.
