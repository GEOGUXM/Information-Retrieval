1. Terms

   1.1 Clearinghouse - The U.S. Federal Government Information
   Clearinghouse ("Clearinghouse") is described in the "Partner's Guide to
   Clearinghouse". The goals of Clearinghouse are: (1) to help people
   easily locate and access U.S. Federal Government information and
   electronic services, and, (2) to encourage the use of standards to
   create and expand access for information and on-line services.
   Clearinghouse encompasses all information and services compiled or
   organized by any source that uses the adopted standards and policies as
   documented in the Collections Policy.

   1.2 Collections Policy - The Collections Policy documents the standards
   and policies adopted among Partners in Clearinghouse. The Collections
   Policy therefore describes how Partners provide Government information
   and comply with various intellectual property, privacy, security, and
   other constraints in law and policy concerning public access to
   Government information.

   1.3 Partner - A Partner agrees to support Clearinghouse standards and
   policies adopted in common as documented in the Collections Policy. Any
   organization working on the standards and policies may declare as a
   Clearinghouse Partner. Partners may also agree annually to participate
   in the Partnership Organization. Examples of interest areas among
   Partners include technology, content, and services.

   1.4 Partnership Organization - The Partnership Organization decides on
   adoption of standards and policies for Clearinghouse and publishes a
   description of these in the Collections Policy. Its works are in the
   public domain, except that the Partnership Organization may exert
   copyright over its identity (e.g., "logo") for the sake of clarity. The
   Partnership Organization is composed of Clearinghouse Partners who have
   signed this Partnership Agreement and agree annually to participate.
   The Partnership Organization may include, among others: various U.S.
   Federal government agencies, private sector corporations and consortia,
   non-government organizations and representatives of the public
   interest, voluntary standards organizations, and academic and research
   organizations or individuals representing those areas. Other
   organizations may also coordinate with the Partnership Organization.

   1.5 Partnership Agreement - This document describes procedures, roles
   and responsibilities of the Partnership Organization. Partners that
   have signed this Partnership Agreement may participate in the
   Partnership Organization.

2. Procedures

   2.1 Composition  - The Partnership Organization has a designated
   Executive Secretary. The Partnership Organization may organize various
   Teams for distinct purposes, including  a Core Team that helps to
   formulate proposals and decision statements. The Partnership
   Organization otherwise organizes itself.

   2.2 Participation  - Partners that have signed this Partnership
   Agreement will be asked annually by the Executive Secretary to
   participate in the Partnership Organization.

   2.3 Discussions and Decisions - The Partnership Organization conducts
   most of its deliberations and formalizes all of its decisions through
   online discussions. Major decisions of the Partnership Organization are
   reached in online discussion by majority vote of participants who vote
   on the specific proposal.

   2.4 Publishing - A central responsibility of the Partnership
   Organization is to publish the Collections Policy document and the
   current version of this Agreement. Any Partner may propose revisions to
   either document through the online discussion. Where substantial
   interest is evident, the Core Team will prepare a proposal and the
   Partnership Organization will act on that proposal.

   2.5 Meetings - The Partnership Organization  holds semi-annual
   face-to-face meetings, at a time and place decided by the Executive
   Secretary after discussion with Partners participating in the
   Partnership Organization.

3. Roles and Responsibilities

   3.1 Status

   The Partnership Organization is an interest group, neither solely a
   government or private sector entity. Adoption of a standard for the
   purposes of Clearinghouse does not constitute endorsement by the U.S.
   Federal Government, nor does it imply that Clearinghouse has validated
   the standard.

   3.2 Policy and Standards

   The Partner will participate in the process of adopting policy and
   standards pertinent to Clearinghouse.

   The Partnership Organization will make the final decisions on issues of
   policy and standards. The Partnership Organization will publish in the
   Collections Policy the current standards and policies adopted by
   Clearinghouse, as well as this Partnership Agreement and the current
   list of Partners participating in the Partnership Organization.

   3.3 Cooperative Cataloging

   The Partner will continuously update locator records if offered as a
   shared Clearinghouse resource. The Partner will help make editorial
   choices on the contents of shared Clearinghouse resources.

   The Partnership Organization collaborates with Partners to assure that
   locator records the Partner maintains are always accessible in any
   shared Clearinghouse resource. The Partnership Organization also
   collaborates with Partners to assure that the records are current
   within a specified number of days. The Partnership Organization makes
   final editorial decisions and will define the precise format, naming,
   and maintenance choices for contents of shared Clearinghouse resources.

   3.4 Automated Gathering

   The Partnership Organization may provide guidelines about automated
   gathering processes (i.e., "crawlers", "spiders", "robots", etc.).
   These processes are often used to gather and characterize information
   on the Internet. The Partner will tell the Partnership Organization
   about any metadata kept about the resources, whether embedded or
   separate.

   The Partnership Organization makes final decisions on the use of
   Partner-provided metadata in shared Clearinghouse resources. The
   Partnership Organization collaborates with Partners to assure that
   automated gathering processes effectively identify Partner resources
   and have minimal impact on Partner operations.

   3.5 Other Information Resources

   The Partner may maintain information continuously accessible for search
   access using standards endorsed by Clearinghouse.

   The Partnership Organization collaborates with Partners to assure that
   any shared Clearinghouse distributed search mechanism operates
   effectively with Partner resources. The Partnership Organization
   collaborates with Partners on how searches rank and present results.

   3.6 Partner Promotion of Clearinghouse

   The Partner includes hyperlinks to other Clearinghouse systems from an
   appropriate high-level Web page and may link to a distributed search of
   Clearinghouse servers. The Partner may also commit to mention
   Clearinghouse in promotional materials.

   Partners within the Partnership Organization collaborate to assure
   appropriate citation and source of Partner information in shared
   Clearinghouse resources.

   3.7 Relationships with Other Organizations

   The Partner will act as liaison between the Partnership Organization
   and other public or private organizations with which the Partner has
   relationships. These may include international, foreign national,
   state, tribal, and local government as well as commercial and
   non-government organizations.

   The Partnership Organization will involve the Partner liaison in
   Clearinghouse activities that overlap with these relationships.

   3.8 Technology Collaboration

   The Partner may collaborate with other Partners on new technologies
   that advance the goals of Clearinghouse. These may include thesauri and
   gazetteers, cooperative cataloging, distributed search, machine-aided
   cataloging, indexing and abstracting, metadata techniques, networking
   infrastructure, privacy and security, among others.

   The Partnership Organization will operate an electronic mail discussion
   list and take other actions to help catalyze collaboration among
   Partners.

4. Effective Date and Signatures

   This Partnership Agreement takes effect immediately on signature until
   canceled by either party.
