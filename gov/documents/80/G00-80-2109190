   NASA Logo WHAT IS NASA CONNECT?

   NASA CONNECT is an annual series of FREE integrated mathematics,
   science, and technology instructional distance learning programs for
   students in grades 6-8. Each program has three components: (1) a
   30-minute television broadcast, which can be viewed live or taped for
   later use; (2) an interactive web activity which provides educators an
   opportunity to use technology in the classroom setting; and (3) a
   lesson guide describing a hands-on activity. These three components 
   television broadcast, web activity, and lesson guide  are designed as
   an integrated instructional package.
   NASA CONNECT is FREE to educators. Registered educators will receive,
   via E-mail, the date of upcoming shows, a show summary, and a PDF
   version of the lesson guide. NASA CONNECT is a U.S. Government product
   and is not subject to copyright. There are no fees or licensing
   agreements. Broadcast and off air rights are unlimited and granted in
   perpetuity.
   Endorsed by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM),
   NASA CONNECT supports national mathematics, science, and technology
   standards. The 2001-2002 series uses proportional reasoning as the
   "integrative thread" that "connects" mathematics topics in each
   program. NASA CONNECT seeks to establish a "connection" between the
   mathematics, science, and technology concepts taught in the classroom
   and the mathematics, science, and technology used everyday by NASA
   researchers. By demonstrating the processes of creativity, critical
   thinking, and problem solving skills, NASA CONNECT enhances and
   enriches mathematics, science, and technology education.
