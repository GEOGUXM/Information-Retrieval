   Results Page 1 of 24 1. Introduction This report summarizes work
   conducted in 1998 by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)
   to determine the extent and origin of plutonium at concentrations above
   background levels at Big Trees Park in the city of Livermore. This
   summary includes the project background and sections that explain the
   sampling, radiochemical and data analysis, and data interpretation.
   This report is a summary report only and is not intended as a rigorous
   technical or statistical analysis of the data. 1.1. Background Big
   Trees Park is a 4.23-acre public park in the city of Livermore located
   about one-half mile west of LLNL (see Figure 1). Plutonium was
   discovered at higher-than-expected concentrations in Big Trees Park in
   1993 during a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) check of
   background plutonium values in the vicinity of LLNL. In 1995, LLNL, in
   collaboration with EPA, state regulators, and the public, collected
   additional soil samples from Big Trees Park to verify the 1993 finding
   and evaluate any potential hazards to the public. After this 1995
   sampling, the EPA and state regulators concluded that the plutonium in
   soil at Big Trees Park was below the residential preliminary
   remediation goal (PRG; 2.5 picocuries/gram), presented no health
   hazard, and required no further action. Early in 1998, a health
   consultation prepared by the California Department of Health
   Services-Environmental Health Investigations Branch (CDHS-EHIB), under
   contract with the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
   Registry (ATSDR), suggested further sampling. LLNL volunteered to
   conduct additional sampling and analysis and to work with the
   regulatory agencies to ensure public concerns were met. In August and
   September 1998, additional soil samples were collected at Big Trees
   Park. The 1998 sampling project addressed Recommendation 1 of the
   health consultation by determining the vertical and lateral extent of
   plutonium-239+240 in the soil. It also evaluated the likelihood of each
   of three potential pathways-water-borne/arroyo distribution,
   plutonium-contaminated sewage sludge used as a soil amendment, and
   aerial distribution-proposed in the health consultation as ways
   plutonium could have reached the park. Finally, special sampling was
   carried out at (1) the disked area, which is an area annually disked
   for weed abatement and an area of special concern to some local
   residents; (2) the playing field adjacent to the school; (3) the
   eastern extension of Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Summary Results Page
   2 of 24 Big Trees Park; and (4) the locations previously identified in
   1995 as exhibiting concentrations of plutonium in soil above background
   levels. A chronology of events, including the development of Big Trees
   Park and the various sampling efforts at the park, is presented in

   Page 5 of 24 2. Sampling The sampling strategy was based on choosing
   sampling locations and analytes that would provide data to (1)
   determine the vertical and lateral extent of plutonium in soil at Big
   Trees Park, (2) pick the most likely plutonium distribution pathway,
   and (3) add data at locations previously identified as exhibiting
   plutonium concentrations in soil that were above background
   concentrations. A summary of sampling locations, numbers of samples
   collected, sampling depths, and materials sampled for (analytes) is
   presented in Table 2. Sampling locations within Big Trees Park are
   shown in Figure 2. Samples were collected, handled, and analyzed as
   specified in the sampling plan (LLNL, 1998; Liddle, 1998). After the
   results were received, the EPA, ATSDR, and LLNL analyzed the quality
   control data and concluded that the data were appropriate for
   determining the levels of plutonium in soil at the park and for making
   decisions about public health and safety. In summarizing the data for
   this report, the following conventions were followed. A detectable
   quantity was defined as a measured result larger than the radiological
   counting uncertainty (two standard deviations), even if the measured
   result was below the analytical minimum detectable amount. Where
   samples taken at any given location were split up, an average of the
   values of the splits, whether analyzed by the same or different
   analytical laboratories, was used to represent the location. Average
   values include both detectable and non-detectable quantities; that is,
   in calculating averages for any data set, all values, including values
   identified as detectable and non- detectable quantities, were used
   (DOE, 1991). The radiological counting uncertainty associated with
   individual results or averages has not been reported. The uncertainty
   among analytical laboratories was similar; no one laboratory was
   noticeably more precise; and consideration of analytical uncertainty
   does not change any of the conclusions reached in the report. An upper
   limit for global fallout background concentrations was defined as 0.012
   picocuries/gram (pCi/g), which is the 80% upper confidence level on the
   95th percentile of annual surveillance data upwind of the LLNL
   Livermore site (LLNL, 1998, Appendix D). The words "above background"
   have been used as a shorthand notation for "above global fallout
   background." As stated previously, this report is a summary report only
   and is not intended as a rigorous technical or statistical analysis of
   the data. Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Summary Results Page 6 of 24

   to determine the extent of plutonium at levels above background was
   conducted on a grid consisting of 4 radial lines (14) and 10
   perpendicular cross lines (A-J). Radial 1 was cast parallel to and next
   to the concrete-lined arroyo channel at the northern edge of the park
   (see Figure 2). The cross lines were drawn perpendicular to Radial 1
   and the channel where possible. Physical obstructions sometimes
   dictated the sample location. Perpendiculars were placed at gradually
   increasing intervals with the result that sampling was densest in the
   area around 1995 Location 1. The grid was Livermore Big Trees Park 1998
   Summary Results Page 8 of 24 mapped in this way to encompass 1995
   sampling locations 1, 7, and 8, which had the highest plutonium
   concentrations in the 1995 study, and to include the ornamental trees,
   which were important in testing the "sludge pathway hypothesis" (see
   Section 2.2.2.). For ease of discussion in this document and to
   underscore that Location 1 special sampling is intended to be part of
   the grid sampling, these locations have been assigned a simple, unified
   numbering system rather than the location naming system used in the
   sampling plan. 2.1.1. Data Analysis and Interpretation Plutonium
   activity data are displayed in Table 3 in entries that correspond to
   the place on the sample grid where the sample was collected. These data
   fall into four categories: nondetects (italics), detections at
   background levels (regular typeface), detections above the 0.012 pCi/g
   background determined from annual surveillance data (boldface), and
   detections of the same order of magnitude as the original 1993 EPA
   sample result for the park of 0.16 pCi/ g (shaded entries). Values in
   the shaded entries are the highest measured activities, and are the
   most likely to be evidence of plutonium concentrations that are above
   background. The data patterns in Table 3 indicate the vertical and
   lateral distribution of plutonium within the sample grid. 2.1.1.1.
   Depth Radiochemical analysis showed that only three samples taken on
   the grid (B1, E1, and H2) yielded Pu-239+240 concentrations above
   background levels (i.e., greater than 0.012 pCi/g) at depths below 10
   cm (see Table 3). Figure 3, which shows average plutonium
   concentrations plotted for the different depth intervals sampled, shows
   that plutonium levels dropped steeply at depths greater than 10 cm.
   Consequently, the above-background plutonium levels are confirmed to be
   at or near the surface. Because above-background plutonium values were
   found only rarely and not found in any pattern at depth, the values
   discussed in interpreting the lateral extent of plutonium
   concentrations are the averages of the samples collected at 05 cm and
   510 cm. 2.1.1.2. Lateral The data show a distinctly higher level of
   plutonium along Radial 1 (see Table 3). Bar graphs of relative
   radionuclide concentrations drawn on the grid clearly depict the higher
   concentrations along Radial 1 (Figure 4). Figure 4 also shows elevated
   Pu-239+240 concentrations along grid perpendicular H, especially at H1
   and H4. Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Summary Results Page 9 of 24

   3. Average plutonium concentrations (pCi/g) at various depth intervals
   at Big Trees Park. (Error bars are standard error of the mean.) The
   Pu-238 data show the same pattern as the Pu-239+240 data, but the
   Pu-238 activity values are approximately 10% of those for Pu-239+240.
   Since the Pu-238:Pu-239+240 activity ratio for weapons grade or fallout
   plutonium is approximately 3 to 6% (Perkins and Thomas, 1980; Battelle,
   1981), this 10% activity ratio indicates that neither fallout nor
   weapons-grade plutonium alone are responsible for the elevated
   plutonium levels present at Big Trees Park. The unusual
   Pu-238:Pu-239+240 activity ratio suggests that the source of plutonium
   is not related to one particular operation, but is more likely a
   mixture of sources, such as the final liquid waste stream from LLNL. In
   addition, mass spectrometric analysis of several samples from Big Trees
   Park yielded excess and variable Pu-242, compared to weapons-grade
   plutonium compositions; these results also strongly indicate that the
   elevated plutonium levels are from several sources or waste streams
   (Lougheed and Moody, 1999; Velsko, 1995; Kelly, 1995). Americium-241
   (Am-241) was measured only for samples collected at the 05 cm depth
   interval at grid locations. Concentrations of americium-241 along the
   grid radials show the same pattern as plutonium (Figure 4). Results for
   these grid locations show that elevated concentrations of plutonium and
   americium are generally confined to the northern border of the park,
   near the ornamental trees. Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Summary

   Pathways One of the three goals of the 1998 sampling was to investigate
   the likelihood of the three proposed pathways- waterborne transport via
   Arroyo Seco, sludge, or aerial deposition-by which plutonium could have
   reached Big Trees Park. 2.2.1. Waterborne/Arroyo Pathway The authors of
   the draft health consultation hypothesized that traces of plutonium
   might have reached Big Trees Park in water-borne sediments carried from
   LLNL down the Arroyo Seco, which cuts across the southwestern corner of
   the LLNL site and flows past Big Trees Park on its northern boundary.
   Low-level plutonium contamination in the southeastern portion of the
   Livermore site was first documented by LLNL in 1974 (Silver et al.,
   1974). The activities responsible for the contamination at the
   southeastern portion of the Livermore site occurred between 1962 and
   1976. Until 1965, part of the southeastern Livermore site did drain to
   the Arroyo Seco. However, since that time the drainage has been
   directed to the center of the site and then to the Arroyo Las Positas.
   Because the Arroyo Seco at Big Trees Park was rechanneled in 1970,
   samples were collected in both the current arroyo channel and in the
   former location of the channel (old arroyo channel) as identified from
   maps. Three locations (Figure 5) were sampled from the old arroyo
   channel, because the old arroyo would be the only place where a
   historic release of plutonium would not have been washed away during
   the intervening years. The current channel was sampled at seven
   locations, which are shown in Figure 5. Upstream (east) of Vasco Road,
   sediment samples in the current arroyo were collected at the 05 cm
   depth interval, consistent with 1995 sampling and recent LLNL
   surveillance monitoring (1993present). At the two locations downstream
   of Big Trees Park and the two locations near the eastern extension of
   the park, sediment samples were collected from the 0-25 cm depth
   interval to determine if older plutonium-containing sediments were
   present. The fill/sediment interface of the old arroyo channel was
   identified for the three planned samples, and the samples were
   collected from the first 0-15 cm below the interface at 305-, 295-, and
   285-cm deep. All arroyo samples were analyzed for Pu-238 and Pu-239+240
   to determine if this pathway could explain the presence of above-
   background plutonium levels along Radial 1. Livermore Big Trees Park

   2.2.1.1. Data Analysis and Interpretation Plutonium concentrations in
   the arroyo samples were nearly all below the detection level. However,
   one field-duplicate and one field-split sample collected at each of the
   two locations downstream of the concrete channel (Fig. 5) contained
   Pu-239+240 at 0.04 pCi/g. If the samples had been of material similar
   to that found along Radial 1, it would have been expected that Pu-238
   would have been detected at approximately 0.004 pCi/g. However, the
   Pu-238 results were well below 0.004 pCi/g; in fact, the Pu-238 values
   were non-detects, indicating that fallout was the source of the
   material found in the arroyo. Moreover, the primary sample associated
   with each of these samples did not contain Pu-239+240 above background
   levels. Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Summary Results Page 14 of 24 The
   average of the Pu-239+240 concentrations for current arroyo sediment
   was 0.0033 pCi/g. The average is within the range of background data,
   and is well below the 1995 Location 1 concentrations (0.164 to 1
   pCi/g). The data collected from the former arroyo channel were all
   below the detectable quantities. The average for the Pu-239+240
   concentrations for "old arroyo" sediment was not detectable, with
   reported values averaging 0.00049 pCi/g. Because the Pu-239+240
   concentrations are well below the 1995 Location 1 range, and the
   average concentration is within the range of background concentrations,
   the waterborne/arroyo channel hypothesis is considered to be unlikely.
   In addition, annual surveillance monitoring of the arroyo shows no
   residue of past releases, nor evidence of recent releases. Moreover,
   the distribution of radionuclides on the grid is also inconsistent with
   an arroyo source, because movement of arroyo soil out of the arroyo to
   the park surface by earthmoving equipment would most likely not be
   confined to the top 10 cm; nor would it likely be confined to Radial 1
   and Perpendicular H. 2.2.2. Sludge Pathway This pathway hypothesis
   suggests that sewage sludge from the Livermore Water Reclamation Plant
   (LWRP) containing Pu-239+240 was a component of a soil amendment used
   when ornamental trees were planted in Big Trees Park along the
   concrete-lined portion of the Arroyo Seco. The probable source of
   plutonium in the sludge is releases to the LLNL sanitary sewer, with
   the largest single release occurring in 1967. Processed sewage sludge
   was made available to the public and municipal agencies for use as a
   soil amendment from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s. According to LWRP
   staff, 1 to 4 years passed from the time effluent entered the sewage
   treatment system until the sludge derived from it was available to the
   public. LLNL effluent reaching the LWRP prior to the 1967 release may
   likely have contained plutonium, but isotopic analyses were not
   conducted at that time. All releases to the LWRP were below the
   applicable regulatory limits of the time. The sludge pathway was
   investigated by sampling the wells of 10 trees likely to have been
   planted when sludge was available as a soil amendment. Radial 1 runs
   along the line of these trees, including trees at 1995 Location 1. A
   1975 aerial photograph shows that trees were present adjacent to the
   arroyo and in the vicinity of 1995 Location 1. In sampling tree wells,
   each tree well location was paired with another location at least 1
   meter beyond the irrigation berm that surrounds each tree. The second
   location was chosen far enough away from the tree well to likely not
   have been affected by soil amendment that might have been introduced to
   the subsurface during tree planting. Livermore Big Trees Park 1998
   Summary Results Page 15 of 24 At each location (both inside and outside
   the tree well), samples were collected at three depths: 045 cm, 4590
   cm, and 90135 cm. The first two intervals were estimates of the depths
   of the holes that were dug to plant the trees. The deepest interval,
   90-135 cm was intended to provide a sample of soil beneath the depth of
   the tree well. Samples were analyzed for Pu-238 and Pu-239+240, Am-241,
   and five metals commonly present in sewer sludge. It was believed that
   if the source of the plutonium at Big Trees Park was sewage sludge,
   metal constituents of the sludge might be detectable in the tree wells
   in quantities greater than the companion samples away from the trees.
   Samples were also analyzed for Am-241 because it was reported to have
   been a constituent of some LLNL sewer releases, and because it is a
   decay product of plutonium-241, which is present in fallout and in
   weapons-grade plutonium. 2.2.2.1. Data Analysis and Interpretation
   Plutonium-239+240 Soils from beneath all 10 trees that were sampled
   exhibited detectable quantities of Pu-239+240 inside the tree well at
   the 045 cm depth internal, and 7 trees had detectable quantities
   outside the tree well at 045 cm. At the deeper depths, four inside
   tree-well samples and three outside tree-well samples had detectable
   quantities of Pu-239+240. The average Pu-239+240 values for the tree
   samples are presented in Table 4. From these averages, it can be seen
   that the Pu-239+240 values are substantially higher inside the tree
   wells at 045 cm than outside the tree wells at 0-45 cm. If a comparison
   is made of each pair of tree samples, only one tree does not exhibit
   this characteristic. The averages also show that Pu-239+240 is more
   prevalent at the shallower 0-45 depth interval than at the deeper ones.
   If the sludge were used as a soil amendment when the trees were
   planted, it is likely that Pu-239+240 values at the 45-90 cm depth
   would be less than those found at 0-45 cm, but greater than the
   Pu-239+240 values found at 90-135 cm. The results actually show much
   higher values at 0-45 cm inside the tree wells than in any other tree
   well samples. The 45-90 cm samples obtained from inside the tree wells
   did not yield results at an intermediate range, as would have been
   expected if the sludge had been place in the tree wells when the trees
   were planted. However, the Pu-239+240 activity actually measured is
   consistent with sludge being applied in the upper part of the tree well
   as a fertilizer or top-dressing after the trees were planted. Livermore

   top-dressing sludge hypothesis can be found by comparing the Pu-239+240
   values in grid samples to values in tree-well samples. If all depths
   (040 cm) of the grid samples at each location are averaged and those
   averages are compared to 0-45 cm deep tree-well samples, the Radial 1
   samples are of the same order of magnitude as the samples collected
   inside the tree wells (see Figure 6), and the other grid samples
   (Radials 24) are of the same order of magnitude as those taken outside
   the tree wells. Plutonium-238 The Pu-238 data also support the
   top-dressing sludge hypothesis. Although Pu-238 is present at lower
   levels, eight of the inside tree-well samples at 0-45 cm had detectable
   quantities of Pu-238. In comparison, all other depths, both inside or
   outside the tree well, had at most three detections. The averages for
   Pu-238 values also show that Pu-238 is substantially higher inside the
   tree wells at 0-45 cm than inside the tree wells at deeper depths or
   outside the tree wells. Americium-241 The Am-241 data cannot be
   interpreted as straightforwardly as the plutonium isotope data because
   of the presence of two outlier values in samples taken outside the tree
   wells. If these values are excluded from the analysis, the Am-241 data
   follow the same pattern as the plutonium. In other words, the mean
   values of the data for samples inside the tree wells at 0-45 cm are
   significantly higher than the data at deeper depths inside the tree
   wells or at any depth outside the tree wells. Livermore Big Trees Park

   measured at grid locations on Radial 1 and in tree wells. Tree samples
   were collected at 045 cm depth intervals and grid samples were
   normalized to the same depth interval. Tree locations are depicted in
   bold for comparison with grid locations. Metals The presence of five
   metals (chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc) was also evaluated
   inside and outside the tree wells at the three depths. The metals were
   not found at concentrations typical of sewage sludge, probably because
   of weathering or leaching of these materials after application of the
   sludge as a soil conditioner. Weathering of metals in sewage sludge
   applied to soil is a well-documented, but not completely understood,
   phenomenon (McBride et al., 1997). Nonetheless, statistically
   significantly higher concentrations of all metals were found at the
   0-45 cm depth when comparing the results from inside the tree wells to
   outside the tree wells. Although the metals at the concentrations found
   could be attributed to the application of other fertilizers or
   pest-control treatments, the metals data remain consistent with the
   top-dressing sludge application hypothesis. Livermore Big Trees Park
   1998 Summary Results Page 18 of 24 2.2.3. Aerial Distribution Pathway
   Another pathway that has been suggested for transmission of plutonium
   to Big Trees Park is aerial distribution. The grid radials show a
   definite increase above background at the first grid radial. The
   pattern of distribution illustrated in Figure 4 is not consistent with
   aerial distribution because aerial distribution would show randomly
   distributed levels of plutonium above background throughout the grid.
   Additional data available about air dispersion of plutonium also do not
   support an air route of transport of plutonium to Big Trees Park from
   LLNL. One potential source could be the Plutonium Facility (Building
   332). However, all plutonium-handling operations are triple-HEPA
   filtered. Sampling systems at the Plutonium Facility consistently show
   no emissions from that building, except in 1980 when a release
   occurred. Air modeling of the release, assuming the wind was blowing
   directly from the Plutonium Facility to the park (which it was not),
   indicates that the amount of plutonium at the park would be too small
   to measure. Similarly, modeling of resuspension of plutonium found on
   the southeast quadrant of the Livermore site, another potential source,
   also cannot explain the pattern of plutonium distribution at Big Trees
   Park. In addition, the meteorological data show that Big Trees Park is
   downwind of the LLNL Livermore site only about 5% of the year. Most
   significantly, air surveillance data collected throughout the Livermore
   Valley do not yield any results that support the suggestion that air
   deposition is the cause of the plutonium levels measured at the park.
   2.2.4. Special Sampling As a result of public comments and discussions
   among DOE/LLNL and the regulatory agencies, samples were also collected
   in the disked area; the playing field; the park's eastern extension;
   and 1995 sampling Locations 1, 7, and 8 (Figure 2). 2.2.4.1. Disked
   Area The disked area is an open field on the northeast corner of the
   school property, next to the park. This area is disked annually, for
   weed abatement and fire control, but otherwise appears to be
   unmaintained. A nearby resident attending a DOE/LLNL- hosted
   presentation of the draft sampling plan reported that children play in
   this area and suggested that the area be sampled. Four samples were
   collected at locations randomly selected within the disked area. After
   several years of disking, it can be reasonably assumed that soil has
   been thoroughly mixed to depths of at least 0-15 cm. Because this is
   the first sampling of this Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Summary
   Results Page 19 of 24 area, the primary question is whether or not
   there are levels of plutonium above background in this area. The
   average Pu-239+240 concentration in the disked area is 0.0018 pCi/g,
   which is well within expected background concentrations. 2.2.4.2.
   Playing Field The playing field is an open field behind the school
   grounds proper. It is now turfed, but was a dirt field at the time of
   sampling. It did not appear to be used by the school as a play area
   during recess, but it was accessible to children as they travel to and
   from school. Location 12 from 1995 was in this area, and, for the 1995
   samples, all three analytical laboratories reported values well within
   the range of background concentrations. Two samples were collected in
   1998 from locations within this area. The average concentration at 0-10
   cm is 0.0013 pCi/g, again, well within expected background
   concentrations. 2.2.4.3. Special Sampling of the Big Trees Park Eastern
   Extension The eastern extension of Big Trees Park was constructed in
   about 1986, approximately 15 years after the development of the main
   grounds of Big Trees Park. It is adjacent to the arroyo, just upstream
   of where the arroyo enters the concrete channel east of Charlotte Way.
   Location 13 from the 1995 sampling was in this eastern extension. Two
   of three laboratories reported results well within the range of
   fallout. The third laboratory reported a result above background, but
   with a high degree of uncertainty (MacQueen, 1995). Three samples were
   collected in 1998 within this area, equally spaced along the length of
   this section of the park. The average Pu-239+240 results were 0.0025
   pCi/g at the 0-10 cm depth. This value is well within the range of
   background. As for one of the arroyo samples, field duplicates of two
   samples at Big Trees Park Eastern Extension contained Pu-239+240 at the
   0.04 pCi/g level. If these samples had been of material similar to that
   found in the first grid radial or the tree wells, Pu-238 would have
   been detected at approximately 0.004 pCi/g. However, the Pu-238 was
   well below that level; the Pu-238 values were non-detects, indicating
   that fallout was the likely source of the material. Moreover, the
   primary sample associated with each of these duplicate samples did not
   contain Pu-239+240 above background levels. Livermore Big Trees Park
   1998 Summary Results Page 20 of 24 2.2.4.4. Special Sampling of 1995
   Sampling Locations 1, 7, and 8 The highest concentrations measured in
   1995 were at Location 1 (0.1641 pCi/g), Location 7 (0.05 pCi/g), and
   Location 8 (0.02 pCi/g). In the 1998 sampling plan, 1995 Location 1 was
   close to the grid locations B1 and C1. The Location 7 sample was near
   grid location H1, and Location 8 was sampled at the end of the ball
   field, near grid location I2. The highest Pu-239+240 concentration of
   the Location 1 special sampling on the grid was 0.037 pCi/g found at
   B3. All samples collected on Location 1 special grid points had
   Pu-239+240 results well below the highest value found in 1995 of 1.0
   pCi/g. The resampling at Location 7 yielded a value of 0.06 pCi/g at
   0-5 cm, confirming the previous result. Interestingly, Location 7 is
   almost on Radial 1, which is closest to the ornamental trees.
   Consequently, the higher values at Location 7 are explainable by the
   soil amendment hypothesis. The resampling at Location 8 yielded a value
   of 0.005 pCi/g at 0-5 cm and 0.009 pCi/g at 5-10 cm. These results do
   not confirm the 1995 0.02 pCi/g result. However, the sample collected
   at the 40-85 cm depth had a value of 0.04 pCi/g. The value for the 1020
   cm sample was 0.005 pCi/g, and the values for the 2030-cm and 3040-cm
   samples were non-detects. The 0.04 pCi/g value for the deepest sample
   is most likely the result of sample inhomogeneity. This sample was
   taken in extremely hard clay, and the field technician experienced
   great difficulty in homogenizing the sample. The maximum value for all
   other locations sampled from this depth was 0.002 pCi/g; the minimum
   value was 0.0001 pCi/g, a non-detect. In any case, the results for
   Location 8 are well below the residential PRG of 2.5 pCi/g, and well
   below any level of health concern. Livermore Big Trees Park 1998
   Summary Results Page 21 of 24 3. Conclusion The extensive soil sampling
   conducted in 1998 in Big Trees Park provides an ample and accurate set
   of data on which to base a number of conclusions. First, the data show
   that there is virtually no above-background plutonium at depths below
   10 cm. Second, the data can be used to gain an understanding of the
   lateral extent of above-background plutonium at the park. The data
   clearly show the plutonium to be primarily associated with grid Radial
   1, with a secondary tendency along grid Perpendicular H. Third, the
   data can be used to deduce which of the three proposed pathways to the
   park is the most likely. The sewage sludge pathway is the most likely
   way for plutonium to have reached the park because it is the only
   pathway hypothesis that is consistent with the data. Finally, and most
   importantly, this large body of data provides substantial evidence that
   the levels of plutonium at the park are well below the U.S. EPA Region
   IX residential preliminary remediation goal of 2.5 pCi/g. This has led
   the U.S. EPA to determine that there is no cause for health concern,
   and there is no need for cleanup at the park. Livermore Big Trees Park
