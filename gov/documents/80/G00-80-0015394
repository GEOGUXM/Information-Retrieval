        How to cite the Comparative Genomic Analysis of Cardiovascular
   Gene Regulation, National Heart, Lung and Blood (NHLBI), Program for
   Genomic Applications (PGA) Web accessible material.
   Citation Policy Origin
   This citation policy was discussed at the PGA-CC meeting in Berkeley
   California in January 2001. The PGA-CC decided that PGA names would be
   used instead of institutional names because several PGAs are
   cross-institutional collaborations.
   The examples below show the essential elements of a citation: the name
   of the document, file, display, or other information obtained from a
   Web Site, the PGA shorthand name, the NHLBI program name, the URL, and
   a timestamp.
   To cite non-peer reviewed PGA publications
   To cite technical documents etc. retrieved from a PGA's ftp site, use a
   format similar to:
   Heart C.V, et al. Cardiovascular Gene Regulation and You. Comparative
   Genomic Analysis of Cardiovascular Gene Regulation PGA, NHLBI Program
   for Genomic Applications. URL: http://pga.lbl.gov/CGRaY.html, [date
   (month, year) accessed].
   To cite specific PGA projects at this site
   Use a format similar to the following example:
   Project name. Comparative Genomic Analysis of Cardiovascular Gene
   Regulation PGA, NHLBI Program for Genomic Applications. URL:
   http://pga.lbl.gov, [date (month, yr) accessed].
   Cardiovascular Comparative Genomic Database (CVCGD). Comparative
   Genomic Analysis of Cardiovascular Gene Regulation PGA, NHLBI Program
   for Genomic Applications. URL: http://pga.lbl.gov, [date (month, year)
   accessed].
   To cite PGA files associated with a publication and downloaded by ftp
   from this site
   Use a format similar to the following example:
   Heart, C.V. Heart Diagram, (2001). Comparative Genomic Analysis of
   Cardiovascular Gene Regulation PGA, NHLBI Program for Genomic
   Applications. URL: ftp://pga.lbl.gov/diagrams/Heart.jpg, [date (month,
   year) accessed].
   To cite PGA content found at this site
   Use a format similar to the following example:
   Heart C.V, et al. Cardiovascular Gene Regulation and You. Comparative
   Genomic Analysis of Cardiovascular Gene Regulation PGA, NHLBI Program
   for Genomic Applications. URL: http://pga.lbl.gov/CGRaY.html, [date
   (month, year) accessed].
   To cite a specific data area or display found at this site
   Use a format similar to the following example:
   Some homology data for this paper were retrieved from the Comparative
   Genomic Analysis of Cardiovascular Gene Regulation PGA, NHLBI Program
   in Genomic Applications. URL: http://pga.lbl.gov/cvcgd, [date (month,
   year) accessed].
