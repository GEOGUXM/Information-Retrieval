Summary

   NERSC's IBM SP is a distributed memory machine with 184 16-CPU POWER3
   SMP compute nodes. Each CPU has a peak performance of 1.5 GFlops. Each
   node has a common pool of 16-64 GByte of memory.

   NERSC also has two different types of Cray computer systems. A
   massively parallel Cray T3E-900, has 644 application processing
   elements, each capable of performing 900 MFlops. A cluster of three
   Cray SV1 machines has a total of 64 vector processors.

   The Parallel Distributed Systems Facility, or PDSF is a networked
   distributed computing environment used to meet the detector simulation
   and data analysis requirements of High Energy Physics and Nuclear
   Science investigations.

   Two auxiliary servers provide specialty symbolic mathematics and
   visualization services.
