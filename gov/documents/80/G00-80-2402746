Introduction.

   idldoc is a program that accepts OMG IDL source code and writes html
   documentation for the contained definitions. It can be used to provide
   Web-accessible documentation for CORBA-compliant distributed objects.

   The Object Management Group (OMG) has specified an Interface Definition
   Language (IDL) for describing the interfaces to CORBA-compliant
   distributed objects. idldoc parses this language, along with special
   comments you write in the IDL source, and uses the result to write
   pages of HTML documentation. If you like, you can examine this simple
   and artificial sample set of pages generated by idldoc. Instructions
   for using idldoc are provided in the idldoc man page.

   If you think the result looks a lot like the output from javadoc, well
   you're right. idldoc takes the javadoc ideas for producing
   documentation from commented source code, and applies these ideas to
   IDL instead of to java.

Implementation Notes.

   idldoc is composed of two parts: a front end that parses the commented
   IDL source code, and a backend that writes the HTML documentation. For
   the front end, we started with an IDL parser from the OMG ftp site.
   This parser was written and made freely available by (unknown, to us)
   folks from Sun Microsystems. This is an excellent bit of work, and in
   distributing this parser, Sun has made a generous contribution to the
   community of CORBA developers.

   The backend part of idldoc traverses the parse tree constructed in the
   front end and emits HTML for each definition. Each module and interface
   definition is written into its own file. For example, for an interface
   Bar defined in module Foo (fully scoped name Foo::Bar), the
   documentation file will be named named "_Foo.Bar.html". In addition to
   modules and interfaces, other entities defined at global scope are
   written into their own file. For example, an exception "badArg" defined
   outside the scope of any interface or module, will have its
   documentation written into "_badArg.html".

   You'll generally not be too concerned about all these file names, since
   these documents are thoroughly interlinked and almost all accesses are
   via links. A file "index.html" is maintained in each documentation
   directory with a global index of all modules, intefaces, and global
   definitions.

Availability.

   idldoc 1.1 is now available for download at this location.

   The current version of idldoc is a maintenance release which fixes a
   few small html-generation bugs and one major bug that prevents the old
   Win32 Intel binary from running on Windows NT 4.0.

   We provide idldoc in the following forms:
     * Source code (happy hacking!).
     * Solaris executable.
     * IRIX executable.
     * Windows NT / Windows 95 executables for both Intel and Alpha
       platforms.(See Win32-related requirements notes).
