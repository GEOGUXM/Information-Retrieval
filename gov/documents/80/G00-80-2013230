                            Where is Cassini Now?

   These images show SIMULATED views of and from the Cassini spacecraft.
   The upper left view shows Cassini on its trajectory to Saturn, as well
   as its speed with respect to the Sun and the distance it has travelled
   since launch. The upper right view shows the view to Earth from
   Cassini. The lower left view shows the view to the next body Cassini
   will encounter, and the lower right view shows the view to Saturn,
   Cassini's final destination. Click on an image to see a full-screen
   view. These images are updated every few hours.
