   Where else in the world do history and the future, nature and
   technology, young and old meet for an unforgettable and inspirational
   journey through space and time? The Kennedy Space Center has hosted
   millions of guests from around the world for more than 30 years --
   telling the story of how the United States built a space program that
   launched men to the moon, orbited satellites that have improved our
   lives, and sent probes into distant space to solve the mysteries of the
   cosmos.
