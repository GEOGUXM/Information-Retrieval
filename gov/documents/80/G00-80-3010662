   The Federal Networking Council (FNC) was chartered by the National
   Science and Technology Council's Committee on Computing, Information
   and Communications (CCIC) to act as a forum for networking
   collaborations among Federal agencies to meet their research,
   education, and operational mission goals and to bridge the gap between
   the advanced networking technologies being developed by research FNC
   agencies and the ultimate acquisition of mature version of these
   technologies from the commercial sector.

   After a year of review and consideration by the Computing, Information
   and Communications (CCIC), the Computing, Information, and
   Communications (CIC) R&D Subcommittee, and the Federal Networking
   Council, it was decided to coalesce the FNC activities into several of
   the newer sub-organizations of the CCIC. Thus on October 1, 1997, FNC
   activities will be carried out through the Large Scale Networking (LSN)
   group. The FNC Advisory Committee has been de-chartered and many of the
   FNC activities are or were transferred to the LSN of the CIC R&D
   subcommittee or the Applications Council.

                    Notes from the April 97 FNCAC meeting
                               August 1, 1997
                           FNC Statement on IAHC:
   Following U.S. Government lead, the Federal Networking Council (FNC)
       has no policy concerning the IAHC proposal. The FNC Co-Chair,
       George Strawn, participated in the IAHC, and the FNC continues to
       encourage open discussion on domain name registration."
