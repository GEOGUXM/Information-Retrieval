   [vspacer.gif]    Facilities Overview

     Leading-edge computing platforms and services make NERSC the
     foremost resource for large-scale computation within DOE. At NERSC,
     we define high performance in practical, not theoretical, terms.
     High performance to us means providing the most productive and
     reliable computing, storage, and networking systems, while
     consistently offering our clients timely services, innovative
     assistance, and convenient training. As new machines are added to
     support aggressive science-of-scale projects, our systems experts
     carefully analyze performance and work with manufacturers to ensure
     that the equipment meets the high performance needs of NERSC
     clients. We've even developed a new benchmark test to assess
     Effective System Performance.

     An IBM RS/6000 SP, a Cray T3E, and a PVP cluster make up the heart
     of NERSC's computer hardware capability. NERSC's 3,328-processor IBM
     RS/6000 SP has 208 16-CPU POWER3+ SMP nodes with a peak performance
     of 5 teraflop/s, making it the second most powerful unclassified
     supercomputer in the world. Each node has a common pool of between
     16 and 64 gigabytes of memory, and the system has 20 terabytes of
     disk space. NERSC has named its newest supercomputer "seaborg" in
     honor of the late Nobel laureate Dr. Glenn Seaborg, longtime
     associate director of Berkeley Lab.

     NERSC's 696-processor Cray T3E-900 (named "mcurie") is an MPP system
     with a peak speed of 575 gigaflop/s, 256 megabytes of memory per
     processor, and 1.5 terabytes of disk storage. We also have a
     parallel vector processing (PVP) cluster consisting of three Cray
     SV1s (kileen, seymour, and bhaskara) with a total of 64 vector
     processors in the cluster, 3 gigawords of memory, and a peak
     performance of 77 gigaflop/s. Additional capabilities are provided
     by two special-purpose servers: a Sun UltraSPARC-II for numerical
     and statistical processing, and a Silicon Graphics Onyx 2 for
     scientific visualization from remote locations.

     To stay ahead of the growing needs of our clients and the growing
     capacity of our computational systems, NERSC works constantly to
     increase the capacity, bandwidth, and functionality of our HPSS mass
     storage system. This year we began increasing our disk cache to 20
     terabytes by adding more Fibre Channel disks, and additional
     high-capacity Fibre tape drives are expanding our archive from 1.3
     to 2 petabytes.

     NERSC's research in data-intensive computing is grounded in our
     operation of a major production facility, the PDSF (Parallel
     Distributed Systems Facility). The PDSF is a 395-processor Linux
     cluster used by large-scale high energy and nuclear physics
     investigations for detector simulation, data analysis, and software
     development. The PDSF's 40 disk vaults provide a total 24 TB of data
     storage.

     Our research into cluster architectures, the PC Cluster Project, is
     focused on two systems, on which we are developing the software
     infrastructure needed to use commodity hardware for high performance
     computing:
     * the 36-node PC Cluster Project Testbed, which is available to NERSC
       users for trial use
     * the 12-node Alpha "Babel" cluster, which is being used for Modular
       Virtual Interface Architecture (M-VIA) development and Berkeley Lab
       collaborations.

     Access to NERSC from anywhere in the U.S. or the world is available
     through ESnet, which provides OC-12 bandwidth to NERSC and Argonne
     National Laboratory, T3 bandwidth on major backbone links, and T1
     links over much of the rest of its coverage area.

     In November 2000, NERSC's computing and storage systems moved from
     Berkeley Lab's main site to the Oakland Scientific Facility in
     downtown Oakland (click here for interactive map).
