   At the marsh (photo inset), streamflow combines with scenarios (that

   Results of the study indicate that much of the recharge occurred during
   the spring snowmelt period. During the summer months, when the plants
   are active, much of the water infiltrating into the soil is inter-
   cepted within the plant root zone. The surface-water model computations
   also show that the amount of recharge to the ground-water system
   differed between areas (fig. 4). The model divides the watershed into
   representative areas called "hydrologic response units" (HRUs). HRUs

   infiltration had greater recharge. One notable result of the fieldwork
