   NASA HOSTS PATIENT SAFETY WORKSHOP

   The new Patient Safety Reporting System (PSRS), a NASA and Department
   of Veterans Affairs (VA) collaboration, will be showcased at six
   one-day workshops for VA patient safety officials. The workshops will
   be held Jan. 8-10 and Jan. 15-17, 2002 at NASA Ames Research Center in
   Californias Silicon Valley.

   The workshops will provide an opportunity for VA patient safety
   officials to learn about the PSRS and how this system will assist them
   in their job of maintaining quality health care. This new reporting
   system, which was established in May 2000, was designed to improve
   patient safety and to document health-care errors and close calls in
   VA health-care facilities. The PSRS is modeled on NASAs highly
   successful Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS), which is managed
   and operated for the Federal Aviation Administration by NASA Ames.

   "The experience gained in operating the ASRS for 25 years will be
   invaluable in establishing the collection of voluntary, confidential
   data reported by healthcare providers on the front line of patient care
   in VA facilities," said Linda Connell, NASA ASRS director and PSRS
   project manager.

   Patient safety officers, quality management officers and union
   representatives from approximately 163 VA medical centers across the
   country will attend. The workshops are being hosted in collaboration
   with the VA National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS), Ann Arbor, Mich.
   The director for NCPS is Dr. James Bagian and the program manager for
   NCPS is Rodney Williams.

   More information about the PSRS can be found at:

   contact Linda Connell at (650) 960-6059.
