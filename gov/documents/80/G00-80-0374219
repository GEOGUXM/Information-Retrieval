   visited the site before. The cookie captures no personally identifying
   information. The FDIC server uses this information to provide certain
   features during your visit to the Web site. You can set your browser to
   warn you when placement of a cookie is requested, and decide whether or
   not to accept it. By rejecting a cookie some of the features available
