      The transition region is a thin and very irregular layer of the Sun's
      atmosphere that separates the hot corona from the much cooler
      chromosphere. Heat flows down from the corona into the chromosphere and
      in the process produces this thin region where the temperature changes
      rapidly from 1,000,000ºC (1,800,000ºF) down to about 20,000ºC
      (40,000ºF). Hydrogen is ionized (stripped of its electron) at these
      temperatures and is therefore difficult to see. Instead of hydrogen,
      the light emitted by the transition region is dominated by such ions as
      C IV, O IV, and Si IV (carbon, oxygen, and silicon each with three
      electrons stripped off). These ions emit light in the ultraviolet
      region of the solar spectrum that is only accessible from space.

      The transition region has been studied from space using instruments on
      several spacecraft including the Solar Maximum Mission and the Solar
      and Heliospheric Observatory. The Transition Region and Coronal
      Explorer (TRACE) mission is now actively acquiring data on the
      structure and dynamics of the transition region. The images to the left
      are from the SUMER instrument on the SOHO Mission. The top image is
      emission from Carbon IV at temperatures of about 100,000ºC. The bottom
      image is emission from Sulfur VI at temperatures of about 200,000ºC.
