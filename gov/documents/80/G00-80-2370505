               Image Based Rendering Assisted Volume Rendering

   [osim.small.jpg]

   Image based rendering technology is used as the basis for volume
   visualization of tera-scale data. Combustion groups at LBL/NERSC
   generate large and time-varying data volumes on NERSC big-iron
   hardware. A collaboration bewteen CCSE and the Berkeley Lab
   visualization group serves as the incubator for a novel new approach to
   volume rendering of large data on commodity workstation platforms. More

                Visualization of Time-Varying Turbulent Flow

   [flame.jpg]

   Modeling of turbulent flows has applications in such fields as
   propulsion, combustion, and environemental flows. In the case of
   combustion, many engines are designed to have the fuel and oxidizer
   introduced into the combustion chamber as co-flowing jets. Mixing on
   the molecular level of these two streams is essential for combustion to
   occur. Near the inflow, the mixing process is dominated by the
   large-scale structures in the flow. Further downstream, as the jet
   develops, the mixing is influenced more by small-scale turbulence. The
   movie clip, demonstrates this mixing.

   This image, and the movie clip, were rendered using a visualization
   technique called "volume rendering" on LBNL graphics hardware. Volume
   rendering is a useful way to view three dimensional data because it
   does not reduce the data to a surface, topologically a two-dimensional
   structure, prior to rendering. The LBNL/NERSC visualization group is
   currently performing LBNL sponsored research in the area of
   software-based tools, such as shear-warp, to enable this type of volume
   rendering on large scale distrubuted memory architectures.

  Collaborations with Physics

    The Supernova Cosmology Project at LBNL

                                [014_sm.jpg]

   The image above and the movie clips ( QuickTime, or MPEG), show three
   representations of a supernova -- an exploding star-- that recently
   occurred in the Centaurus A galaxy. The image on the left shows how a
   supernova appears as it brightens and fades -- becoming comparably
   bright to the entire galaxy of stars in which it explodes. The upper
   right graph shows this brightness as a function of time, and the moving
   dot indicates where on this curve the supernova's brightness is, from
   the image at left. The bottom right graph shows how the spectrum of the
   supernova changes during this same period. The height of this graph for
   each color shows how bright the supernova is in that color.

   This clip was prepared by the Supernova Cosmology Project with the help
   of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Computer Visualization
   Laboratory at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center.

    Plasma Research at MIT

                      [torus1-sm.jpg] [flashy2-sm.gif]

   It is estimated that plasmas make up 99% of all matter in our universe.
   They can be found everywhere from the Sun and other stars to the neon
   sign at your local bar. One of the most important goals of plasma
   research is to create a thermonuclear fusion reactor that will produce
   electricity and serve as a source of plentiful energy. One device used
   to contain plasmas while they are heated to the extremely high
   temperatures needed for fusion to occur is called a Tokamak. Scientists
   are studying how instabilities develop in this toroidal magnetic bottle
   (pictured above) that limit how long the plasma can be contained.

   The first image shows current density on the midplane of the tokamak
   and in three cross-sectional slices. The second image shows an
   isosurface of the same dataset. This visualization helped researchers
   demonstrate inaccuracies in standard computer models of tokamaks.

   Computations suggest that the quarks which compose protons are confined
   in space. How they are confined determines the size of protons which
   are a fundamental part of all atoms. We show a single three dimensional
   slice of a four dimensional space depicting the probable location
   densities using colored volumes and surfaces. Such visualization
   techniques allow researchers to explore and understand the results of
   their complex computations done on supercomputers. The underlying
   computations were accomplished using NERSC's 128 processor Cray T3E
   supercomputer.

   One of these images appears on the cover of a NERSC periodical Buffer,
   Fall 1996.

    Nuclear Science at LBNL

                    [star-far-sm.gif] [star-near-sm.gif]

   The STAR project involves building a large particle detector which will
   aid in the search for the quark-gluon plasma. The detector records the
   locations of ionization events (blue or red squares in the images) as
   the particles given off by the collision pass through the gas filling
   the chamber. The events are then reconstructed into tracks (red lines)
   by pattern recognition software.

   Software was written by the STAR group to visualize the tracks and
   detector. The visualization group rewrote the code to use OpenGL
   instead of GL (to increase portability) and added support for 6 DOF
   input devices such as a "3D mouse".

                             [pruess.small.jpg]

   Virtual Reality technology is used to implement a user-interface which
   permits a scientist to visualize and manipulate a subset of a large,
   three-dimensional data set with complex spatial structure. As part of a
   1997 LDRD, Researchers at LBNL and the University of California,
   Berkeley, are developing a code to model chemical and hydrological
   processes which will run on an MP machine at NERSC The half-million
   data points are assay measurements from 11,000 bores, and provided by a
   mining company in Chile.

    BP Exploration and Western Atlas Software

                      [acti_imgcontest_entry.small.gif]

   Title: In the Mix. This is LBNL's entry into the 1996 SGI image
   contest. More info.

   A collaborative effort involving LBNL, Western Atlas Software, and BP
   Exploration focuses on developing new techniques for visualizing oil
   flux. One method of "direct" visualization of underground oil transport
   uses icons, such as cones, at grid points. An indirect method derives
   information about the oil flow, and is represented with streamlines.
   These techniques and numerous others were rapidly prototyped at the
   Berkeley Lab Visualization Laboratory under the ACTI Initiative. Visit
   our ACTI home page.

     [n_america.small.jpg]

   Thousands of seismic events collected over the years provide raw data
   that is used as input to a computation run on the NERSC Cray T3E. That
   inversion code computes the structure of the Earth's mantle. Scientists
   are seeing for the first time structures located deep within the earth
   at the core-mantle boundary.

   microtubules, using cryo-electron microscopy and image processing, at a
   resolution of about 8 Å, sufficient to resolve much of the secondary
   structure. More information.

    Chemical Structure Determination

                               [kd.small.gif]

   Actin, a protein, is a major component of muscle. Muscles are formed
   from millions of fibers, which in turn are built from protein
   molecules. One representation of the actin molecule is the structural
   backbone, which shows the bonds between atoms using a "stick" model. A
   different representation of actin is electron density. We show electron
   density at two different resolutions. The brown surface is a high
   resolution surface obtained by X-Ray crystallography. The blue surface
   is computed from a simulation where the resolution has been
   artificially reduced. The purpose of the visualization is to aid in
   interpreting experimental data that is limited in resolution.
   Researchers make use of visualization tools to verify that structures
   apparent in lower resolution data correspond to structures in higher
   resolution data.

    NMR Simulation

   Material Scientists use Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technology for
   many purposes, including chemical structure determination. To better
   understand the results of NMR experiments, UCB/LBNL researchers are
   using the Cray T3E supercomputer to simulate the response of
   crystalline structures to an applied magnetic field. This image shows
   the induced current (white arrows) and charge density (colored plane
   and grey surface) in crystalized glycine. For more information on this
   work, see the Project page.
