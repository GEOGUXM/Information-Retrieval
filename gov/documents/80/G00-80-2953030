          The NIMH Intramural Fellowship Training Program located in the
   [Cell image] Office of the Scientific Director (OSD), is headed by
   Barry B. Kaplan, PhD., Director for Fellowship Training. Dr. Kaplan is
   charged with the development and oversight of DIRP's integrated
   multidisciplinary training program and with providing administrative
   support and resources for all training-related activities.

         Within the program, trainees are expected to carry out discrete
   portions of research studies and/or to operate highly specialized
   equipment. Such work is an integral part of their training activities
   and essential to their future development as independent investigators.
   It also constitutes a valuable service to NIMH. The combined
   opportunity for study and for practical work experience is a
   distinguishing feature of fellowship training in the intramural
   program. NIMH is committed to an affirmative action program that
   includes steps to improve the representation of minorities, women, and
   scientists with disabilities in the mainstream of basic and clinical
   neuroscience research.

   DIRP, please contact Barry B. Kaplan, PhD at the Office of Fellowship
