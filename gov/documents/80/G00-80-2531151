                COPYRIGHT OFFICE RECORDS AVAILABLE UNDER THE
                      FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA)

     * United States Copyright Office Freedom of Information Act Annual
       Report FY 2000

     The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which can be found in Title 5
     of the United States Code, section 552, was enacted in 1966 and
     provides that any person has the right to request access to federal
     agency records or information. This right of access is enforceable
     in court. All agencies of the United States government are required
     to disclose records upon receiving a written request for them,
     except for those records that are protected from disclosure by the
     nine exemptions and three exclusions found in the FOIA. The federal
     FOIA does not provide a right of access to records held by Congress,
     the courts, state or local government agencies, or by private
     businesses or individuals. All states have their own statutes
     governing public access to state and local records and state
     authorities should be consulted for further information about such
     records.

  What Kinds of Records Does the Copyright Office Keep?

    1. Information about registrations and deposits.

     The Copyright Office maintains records of deposits, registrations,
     recordations, and other documents related to copyright registration.
     In accordance with sections 705 and 706 of title 17, United States
     Code (U.S.C.), records are available for public inspection, and most
     may be copied for a fee. The Copyright Office will not make copies
     of registered deposit material unless authorized by the copyright
     claimant or for other specified reasons related to litigation
     activity. The Office's Circulars 6 and 22 provide details about
     gaining access to this information and the charges that may be
     assessed for obtaining this data.

     In addition, you may request copyright forms, circulars, and other
     information publications by telephone; call the Copyright Office's
     Forms Hotline at (202)707-9100 and leave a recorded request for
     application forms and circulars if you know which items you want.
     There is no charge for circulars and forms supplied by the Copyright
     Office. Other information about the copyright law and Office
     procedures may be obtained by calling (202)707-3000.

     A complete copy of the 1976 Copyright Act, as amended, may be
     obtained by requesting Circular 92 from the Superintendent of
     Documents, P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7954. Request stock
     number 030-002-00195-1. You may call the Government Printing Office
     at (202) 512-1800, or fax (202) 512-2250.

    2. Policy statements and Office records.

     The Copyright Office is subject to the Freedom of Information Act,
     title 5, U.S.C., section 552, which requires that government
     agencies make records that affect the public available for
     inspection and copying. The FOIA is based on the principle that an
     informed public is essential to the democratic process. Regulations
     specifically addressing requests made under the Freedom of
     Information Act can be found at 37 Code of Federal Regulations
     (C.F.R.), Part 203. Data about information requests which concern
     the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, can be found at 37 C.F.R.,
     part 204.

  How to Make a FOIA Request

     Most requests the Copyright Office receives for information from
     parties invoking the FOIA are actually information requests of the
     nature routinely received by the Office's Public Information Office.
     These are requests for information about records that are maintained
     by the Office as part of its registration and recordation
     operations. As mentioned above, the Office publishes forms and
     pamphlets that explain how one can access these records and specify
     the fees charged for searching for and copying these records.

     In addition to its registration records, the Copyright Office makes
     the following information available for inspection and copying under
     the FOIA: records of copyright registrations and of final refusals
     to register claims to copyright; statements of policy and
     interpretations which have been adopted but were not published in
     the Federal Register; and administrative staff manuals and
     instructions to the staff that affect members of the public. This
     information is available for inspection and copying in the Office's
     Public Information Office in a paper format; it can also be provided
     to requesters in electronic format where feasible.

     The Copyright Office's Supervisory Copyright Information Specialist
     is responsible for responding to all initial requests submitted
     under the FOIA. People who want access to Copyright Office records
     under the FOIA should make a written request to that effect and send
     it by mail to:

     Supervisory Copyright Information Specialist
     Copyright Office GC/I&R
     P.O. Box 70400
     Washington, DC 20024

     To facilitate a prompt response, the request should be plainly
     marked Freedom of Information Act Request. Moreover, records
     requested should be well-described. This means the description
     should enable the Office to identify the records requested by any
     process that is not unreasonably burdensome or disruptive to Office
     operations. Response will be made within twenty working days. The
     Office may contact the requester to attempt to narrow or further
     define the nature and scope of the request. A requester is advised
     to provide a daytime telephone number, fax number, and/or e-mail
     address in case the Supervisory Copyright Information Specialist
     needs additional data.

     If a request is denied, the notification will include the basis for
     the denial. Appeals may be made in writing to the General Counsel,
     United States Copyright Office, at the address listed above. Appeals
     must be made within 30 calendar days of the date a denial is
     received.

  List of Records

     The Privacy Act of 1974 requires that the Copyright Office maintain
     a list of the systems of records it keeps, together with
     descriptions of the records kept in those systems and methods the
     public may use to access information in the systems. The most up to
     date version of the systems of records was published in September
     1998 and amended in October 1999. This updated list reflects
     changes, additions and deletions of records maintained by the Office
     since the last publication of systems of records, which occurred in
     August 1993.  Follow this link for the complete list of Copyright
     Office System of Records.
