                Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN) is a
   multi-center research program involving a collaboration of clinicians
   and engineers in academia, industry, and government. Together, they are
   pursuing in-depth studies of crashes, injuries, and treatments to
   improve processes and outcomes. CIREN's mission is to improve the
   prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of motor vehicle crash
   injuries to reduce deaths, disabilities, and human and economic costs.

   What CIREN is all about PDF logo
   CIREN is a collaboration of research on crashes and injuries at ten
   Level 1 Trauma Centers linked by a computer network. Researchers can
   review data and share expertise, which could lead to the design of
   safer vehicles. Seven of these Centers are funded by NHTSA, one by
   Mercedes-Benz, and one by Ford. The Froedtert Hospital & Medical
   College of Wisconsin CIREN Center is self-funded. Level 1 Trauma
   Centers are traditionally "teaching" institutions associated with a
   university.

   NEW! CIREN Electronic Cases
   The CIREN database consists of multiple discrete fields of data
   concerning severe motor vehicle crashes, including crash reconstruction
   and medical injury profiles. Personal and location identifiers and
   highly sensitive medical information have been removed from the public
   files to protect patient confidentiality. CIREN cases, extending back
   to 1996, for which coding and quality control have been completed, are
   available for public viewing. Additional cases are released to the
   public as they become available.
