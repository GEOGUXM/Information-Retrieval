   Frequently Asked Questions

      Answers to questions most frequently asked of State Parks information
      specialists are as follows:
      Q. Where do I get a map of a specific state park campground with
      campsite numbers?
      A. State Parks is in the process of updating all campground maps.
      Currently, you can view maps for about half of the State Parks
      campgrounds.
      Q. I cant get through to the State Parks central reservations system
      (busy signal) in order to make a reservation at a state park. Can I
      call someone else or make a reservation any other way?
      A. The central reservation system is the only number visitors can call
      to make a reservation at some state parks and unfortunately, the line
      is often busy due to heavy call volume. Reservations can also be made
      online and you may browse a chart indicating whether a park is
      reservations only or first-come, first-served.
      Q. Can I make a reservation on line?
      A. Yes, you can make a reservation online. Multiple campsite
      reservations and pass holders who receive free or reduced camping need
      to call (888) CAMPOUT or (888) 226-7688.
      Q. How do I get a phone number for a state park?
      A. Due to limited staff within each state park, the ranger on duty is
      typically in the park rather than in the park office, so reaching park
      staff by phone is often very difficult and thus, a park phone list is
      not published within this site. However, visitors can call State Parks
      at (360) 902-8844 to request a phone number for a state park. The
      information line operates Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
