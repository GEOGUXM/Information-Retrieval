      Ham Radio

      When astronauts, cosmonauts and mission specialists from many nations
      fly on the International Space Station, they will have amateur, or ham,
      radio as a constant companion.

      Since its first flight in 1983, ham radio has flown on more than
      two-dozen space shuttle missions. Dozens of astronauts have used the
      Space Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment, or SAREX, to talk to thousands
      of kids in school and to their families on Earth while they were in
      orbit. They have pioneered space radio experimentation, including
      television and text messaging as well as voice communication. The
      Russians have had a similar program for the cosmonauts aboard the
      Russian Space Station MIR. When U.S. astronauts were aboard MIR in
      preparation for the long duration missions of the International Space
      Station, they used amateur radio for communication, including emergency
      messaging while MIR was in distress.

   organization, or ARISS.
   ARISS was created in 1996 to meet certain objectives and was the
   logical outgrowth of the very successful amateur radio activities on
   the Mir space station and the space shuttle.

      As human space flight moves into a new uncharted era, an organization
      called ARISS, which stands for Amateur Radio International Space
      Station, has been formed to design, build and operate equipment. In
      1996, delegates from major national radio organizations and from AMSAT,
      which stands for the Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation, in eight
      nations involved with the International Space Station signed a
      Memorandum of Understanding to form ARISS.

      NASA and the Russian space organization Energia have signed agreements
      that spell out the place of amateur radio on the station. A technical
      team, called ISS Ham, has been officially established to serve as the
      interface to support hardware development, crew training and on-orbit
      operations.

      In the United States, the American Radio Relay League, which is also
      known as ARRL, and AMSAT provide leadership and consultation. They also
   donate and build hardware as well as making sure safety and
   qualification tests are successfully completed so the equipment can
   fly. The Russians have provided ports so that antennas can be mounted
   on the station's Zvezda Service Module -- the space station unit that
   provides living quarters for the astronauts and cosmonauts. United
   States and Russian teams have trained the astronauts and cosmonauts to
   operate the equipment. The Italian team has designed and built
   antennas. The German team has built sophisticated repeater stations
   that will allow crews to make recorded reports on their daily
   activities and permit hams on Earth better contacts with men and women
   aboard the station. ARISS hopes to have Slow Scan Television in place
   by 2001.

   This is a photo of the initial radio station amateur equipment while it
   was being tested. After testing, the equipment was stowed aboard Space
   Shuttle Atlantis for delivery to the International Space Station during
   STS-106.

   The initial space station operations will be mostly voice and packet, a
   text messaging device. The first initial radio station was flown
   onboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis on STS-106. The crew transferred the
   ham radio gear into the space station for future use by the Expedition
   One crew.

   More than 40 missions over five years will be required to assemble the
   International Space Station in orbit. The astronauts and cosmonauts
   will work hard on these missions, but they plan to take some time off
   for educational outreach contacts with schools. NASA's Division of
   Education is a major supporter of the amateur radio activity.

   The sponsoring agencies have stated that they consider access to a ham
   radio system a requirement for psychological support of the crews, by
   providing family and general contacts for people who will be in space
   many weeks at a time.

   As the International Space Station takes its place in the heavens, the
   amateur radio community is prepared to do its part by helping to enrich
   the experience of those visiting and living on the station.
