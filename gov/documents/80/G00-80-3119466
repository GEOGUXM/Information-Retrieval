   Electron-molecule and electron-atom collisions initiate and drive
   almost all the relevant chemical processes associated with radiation
   chemistry in the environment, radiation damage to living systems,
   plasma processing of materials for micro-electronic devices and other
   environmental remediation, and everyday lighting technology. Radiation
   damage to the DNA of living systems by ionizing radiation is
   predominantly initiated by dissociative attachment of secondary
   electrons to biological molecules and water. In spite of the importance
   of these fundamental processes, only fragments of the fundamental
   chemistry and physics are well understood, and only a few of the
   required cross sections and reaction rates for the multitude of
   important molecules are known with confidence.

   Professor McCurdys research group is developing new theoretical
   approaches and large-scale computational capabilities to attack these
   problems using the complex Kohn variational principle. Because the
   incident electron is indistinguishable from those of the target
   molecule, the electronic structure of the molecule is not separable
   from the collision problem. New formalism is being coupled with the
   powerful existing technology of bound-state quantum chemistry to
   combine variational calculations on electronic collisions with a modern
   quantum chemistry program package. This work makes use of the tools of
   modern computer science, including new parallel algorithms appropriate
   for computers with thousands of processors. Multidimensional
   time-dependent methods are being used to treat the motion of nuclei
   during long-lasting electronic collisions near resonances corresponding
   to temporary negative ions.

   Recently the long-standing problem of the complete quantum description
   of the collisional breakup of a quantum three-body system was
   effectively solved numerically for the first time by the Professor
   McCurdys group. The solution required a recasting of the Schrödinger
   equation in terms of complex valued coordinates for the electrons,
   thereby converting the complicated Coulomb boundary conditions for
   breakup into a simple form. To solve the resulting Schrödinger equation
   on a finite difference grid required extensive calculations using LBNLs
   massively parallel computers, even for a two-electron system.
