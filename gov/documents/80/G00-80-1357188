     We are developing software agents to provide a wide range of
     management and monitoring functions for distributed resources. We
     call this system Java Agents for Monitoring and Management (JAMM).
     The ability to monitor and manage distributed computing components
     is critical for enabling high performance data intensive computing.
     As distributed systems become bigger and more complex, there are
     more pieces to monitor and manage. Our approach to this problem is
     to use a collection of software agents that can perform various
     administrative tasks. Agents can securely start any monitoring
     program on any host, and manage the output of any monitoring data.

     The JAMM system is one of several reference implementations of the
     Monitoring archetecture being put together by the Grid Performace
     Working Group in the The Grid Forum .

Sample Web-based Tools:

     * An applet that shows the current values for vmstat, netstat and
       xntp for a set of DPSS hosts
     * An applet that keeps a running chart of vmstat, netstat and xntp
       values for a set of DPSS hosts
     * Status Graphs of Hosts
