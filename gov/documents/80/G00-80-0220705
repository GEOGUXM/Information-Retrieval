     __________________________________________________________________

   The IV&V Facility works to advance the science of software engineering
   to improve the safety, quality, reliability, cost, and performance of
   NASA software systems. Independent verification and validation
   encompasses all aspects of the software development life cycle.
   Recent incidents have shown that software reliability is as critical to
   mission success as hardware reliability. In contrast to hardware, the
   methods needed for developing, testing and certifying mission critical
   software are not fully developed. New techniques and methodologies for
   all phases and aspects of software development are continually being
   introduced.
   The NASA IV&V Facility must remain ahead of the developers applying
   these new approaches, creating IV&V techniques and tools applicable to
   the new development approaches and advanced computing architectures.
   The IV&V research program is intended to develop methodologies and
   tools to improve the quality of IV&V of the software produced by and
   for NASA, and to assist NASA in becoming a leader in the development of
   safe, reliable, cost-effective software.
   With this combination of efforts, the IV&V Facility is able to take a
   research topic from concept formation, model development, and
   verification to operational use.
   Research activities of the IV&V Facility are concentrated under the
   OSMA SARP and internal IV&V Research projects.
   OSMA SARP
   The IV&V Facility manages the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance
   Software Assurance Research Program (OSMA SARP). In this program, the
   OSMA sponsors research initiatives from:
     * NASA Centers
     * West Virginia University and other universities
     * Industry

   Each year The results of these research initiatives are presented at
   the annual OSMA Software Assurance Symposium.
   IV&V Facility Research Projects
   The IV&V Facility research projects include research done by NASA IV&V
   Facility Civil Servants. The IV&V Facility collaborates with
   organizations to integrate their research efforts into related NASA
   programs. Those organizations are:
     * NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance
     * NASA Centers
     * Academic Institutions
     * Industry
