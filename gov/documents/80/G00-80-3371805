                            Science and Analysis

   The primary objective of the ILRS is to provide a service to support,
   through analysis of Satellite and Lunar Laser Ranging data and related
   products, geodetic and geophysical research activities as well as IERS
   products important to the maintenance of an accurate International
   Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). The ILRS collects, merges, archives
   and distributes Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) and Lunar Laser Ranging
   (LLR) observation datasets of sufficient accuracy to satisfy the
   objectives of a wide range of scientific, engineering, and operational
   applications and experimentation. The service also develops the
   necessary standards/specifications and encourages international
   adherence to its conventions.(c.f. ILRS Terms of Reference
   Introduction)
