                                 OBJECTIVES
     __________________________________________________________________

   [blueball.gif] We take a synergistic and interdisciplinary approach to
   apply space-based observations, ground-based measurements, and
   numerical model to study the coupled ocean-atmosphere system.

   [blueball.gif] We improve the monitoring, from space, of
   ocean-atmosphere exchanges in momentum, heat and water.

   [blueball.gif] We study how these exchanges force ocean circulation and
   distribute the heat, water, greenhouse gases, and nutrients stored in
   the ocean.

   [blueball.gif] We examine the effect of these exchanges on the enery
   and hydrologic balances in the atmosphere.

   [blueball.gif] We focus on seasonal-to-interannual variability and
   predictability, but also examine how such variability is affected by
   shorter time scales (intra-seasonal) changes and longer time scales
   (decadal) trend. We are planning to study the manifest of long-term and
   global variability in local and near-term hazards, such as hurricane
   and monsoon.

   STATEMENTS
     __________________________________________________________________

   [blueball.gif] The 3-5 year life cycles and repeated global coverage of
   spaceborne sensors are conducive to the studies of SEASONAL-INTERANNUAL
   variability and predictability.

   [blueball.gif] The high resolution and synoptic perspectives of
   spaceborne sensors improve the monitoring and understanding of
   transient NATURAL HAZARDS.

   [blueball.gif] With expected continuous development, spaceborne sensors
   will reveal not only the effects of short-term (INTRASEASONAL) but also
   long-term(DECADAL) changes on seasonal-interannual variabilities. The
   manifest of global and long-term changes on local and near-term weather
   and hazards are being pursued.

   [blueball.gif] From the vantage point of space, disciplinary boundaries
   are not high obstacles. All spacebased sensors measure radiance from
   the same electromagnetic spectrum; observations are intrinsically
   complementary. We view the Earth as a single system and seek the best
   combination of tools (satellite observations, in situ measurements and
   numerical models), in INTERDISCIPLINARY and MULTISENSOR research.
