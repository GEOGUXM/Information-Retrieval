   Terrain modeling is the mathematical study of the ground surface, both
   individual landforms and continuous topography. It has been called
   terrain analysis, quantitative geomorphology, and (geo)morphometry; the
   newer term digital terrain modeling is now common. The origins of
   terrain modeling go back some 150 years to simple field and contour-map
   measurements by Alexander von Humboldt and later German geographers.

   Terrain modeling today is a combination of Earth and computer sciences,
   mathematics, and engineering. Many of its results are calculated from
   square-grid arrays of terrain heights, or digital elevation models
   (DEM's). Examples include maps of shaded relief (upper left), slope
   angle (middle), slope direction (lower), river basins, and various
   other quantities.

   Terrain modeling is growing rapidly and is used in many ways. Numerical
   descriptions of topographic relief and its spatial pattern play a role
   in geology, geography, geophysics, and exploration of Earth's sea-floor
   and the planets.

   Terrain modeling is used to assess the severity of geologic hazards,
   estimate soil erosion, model tectonic events, predict the movement of
   surface and ground water, and tackle other problems in science and
   engineering. Its importance for the study of Earth's surface processes
   and how they interact with other phenomena is evident from the
   inclusion of terrain-modeling capabilities in such standard geographic
   information system (GIS) software as IDRISI, GRASS, and ARC/INFO.

   Terrain modeling assists the San Francisco Bay Project to fulfill
   several of its responsibilities. Among these are:
     * predicting locations of potential debris flows in steep areas - by
       computing digital maps of surface slope and curvature from DEM's;
     * identifying hillside locations that might be subject to other types
       of landsliding - by combining measures of terrain form with the
       physical characteristics of rocks and soils;
     * helping local officials to make wise land-use decisions - by
       creating quantitative maps showing steepness of slope; and
     * visualizing the Bay area's landscape to better understand the
       processes shaping it - by computing digital shaded-relief maps.
