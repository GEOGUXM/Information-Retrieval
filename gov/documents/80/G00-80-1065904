   Final Rule for Clinical Diagnostic Lab Services

      HCFA is responsible for tracking emerging technologies and patterns of
       care to determine applicability of existing national coverage policy
         and to assess the need for policy change. We have redesigned our
           Medicare coverage policy-making process to make it more open,
       understandable, and predictable. Part of our redesign includes using
      the Internet to inform interested parties about how coverage decisions
          are made and the progress of each issue under coverage review.

          If you are just browsing, use the links on the left to navigate
       throughout the site. To search for a specific issue, you can use the
       site Index or Personnel Directory. Most pages have the E-mail address
       of a contact person should you need additional information or want to
      provide feedback. Technical comments about the site should be directed
                                to Eileen Davidson.

      You can also receive periodic e-mail alerts on National Coverage issues
      by subscribing to our coverage mailing list. You may do so by clicking
              the List Serv link on the Navigation Bar to your left.

      To learn more about current Medicare national coverage policy, you can
       read our Coverage Issues, Intermediary, and Carrier Program Manuals.
       Information on the negotiated rule for clinical diagnostic laboratory
        tests can be obtained from Jackie Sheridan. To find out about local
      Medicare coverage policy, you can contact your Intermediary or Carrier
                             or link to the LMRP.NET.

       If you are interested in HCFA's quality improvement activities, visit

        to find out how HCFA and FDA work together for quality improvement.
