   The Integrated Space Transportation Plan (ISTP) is NASA's long-range
   investment strategy for safer, more reliable, and less expensive access
   to space by enabling the U.S. aerospace industry to develop new,
   privately owned and operated space transportation systems, with NASA as
   a customer. The ISTP reflects the needs of the aerospace industry,
   national security goals, and the mission of America's civil space
   Agency.
