      Web Site Availability of Hearings Calendars

      Calendars of Court Hearings and First Meetings for our judges are no
      longer available in the old BANCAP System format. You may produce these
      reports via the Web-based version of PACER, called ECFPacer
      (http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/), using your PACER account login and
      password. This requires your entry of some report criteria and clicking
      on RUN REPORT to produce the calendar of your choice. Direct questions
      to your local Western District of Texas Bankruptcy Court Clerk's
      Office.
