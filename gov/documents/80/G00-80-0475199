   Mission

   Why we're here and what we do . . .

   The U.S. Geological Survey is the Nation's largest earth-science agency
   and has the principal responsibility within the Federal Government for
   appraising the earth resources of the Nation and for providing
   hydrologic or earth-science information.

   In Louisiana, the U.S. Geological Survey engages in a wide range of
   earth-science data-collection and appraisal activities. The activities
   are described in the Louisiana Fact Sheet. This work is supported by
   cooperative programs with the Louisiana Departments of Transportation
   and Development, Natural Resources, Environmental Quality, and other
   local, State, and Federal agencies.
