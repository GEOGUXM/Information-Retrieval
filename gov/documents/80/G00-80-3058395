The State Library is open for business in Tumwater.

   TUMWATER - The State Library has completed the move from Olympia to
   Tumwater and is now open to walk-in customers on Wednesday, January 2,
   2002.  Come visit the new temporary location!  Throughout the move time
   all web services (www.statelib.wa.gov), email and phones have been up
   and operating.  "I am very proud of the State Library staff.  Despite
   the fact that they had to prepare for the moving of the library, and
   then work without easy access to materials while movers were moving us
   into the new building, they remained committed to keeping as many
   services as possible available to our customers.  Typically libraries
   must fully close to move, but in this case our staff were able to work
   together to keep all but a few services fully operational," stated
   Nancy Zussy, State Librarian.
