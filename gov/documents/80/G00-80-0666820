   PPOC shows through catalog records and images a rich cross-section of
   still pictures held by the Prints & Photographs Division and other

   records to about 46% of the Division's holdings. About 90% of the
   records are accompanied by one or more digital images. In some
   collections, only thumbnail images display to those searching outside
   the Library of Congress. Some of the records in PPOC are also found in
   the LC Online Catalog.

                Alternative Interface for the Online Catalog
     __________________________________________________________________

   This is a simple interface using a Z39.50 gateway. It also works well
   for text-based Web browsers (e.g., Lynx) or for Internet interaction in
   text-only mode. This alternative interface does not provide the
   following information and features found in the primary LC Online
   Catalog (above): status and holdings in the Library collections; and,
   searches limited by date, language, material type, country of
   publication, and Library of Congress location.

   * All Library of Congress Catalogs are available 24 hours a day, 7 days
   a week (except during periods of maintenance, usually in late
   evening/early morning Eastern Time).
