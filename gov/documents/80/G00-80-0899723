   Hi! My name is Gwynne Crowder and I work on TopHat, a scientific
   project in the field of experimental cosmology. I am 20 years old and
   attend the University of Chicago. I am leaving for Antarctica on
   November 6 and should be there through approximately January 15.

   While I'm on *the ice*, I am keeping in contact with some 5th and 6th
   grade classes. On this webpage, I will share what my experiences are
   like in a travel journal, have pictures to show, and run some
   experiments with the students. Before I left, I visited the classes,
   one in Carlisle, Indiana and one in St. Paul, Minnesota so that I could
   introduce myself and what I'm doing to the students. Please go see the
   pictures from these presentations! Also, there are some pictures from
   the place where I work. If you have any questions or comments, PLEASE
   send them to me at sgcrowde@midway.uchicago.edu. To check out answers
   to questions that I have received click here.

               Antarctic Experiments for Beginning Scientists

                          The Solar Locator Project

                           *The vital information*

   Who: University of Chicago (my school!), University of Wisconsin, NASA
   and the Danish Space Research Institute.

   What: We are releasing a helium balloon that will go above about 99% of
   the atmosphere.

   Where: We release the balloon from McMurdo, Antarctica. McMurdo is on
   Ross Island in the Ross Sea.

   Why: To measure the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. From our
   measurements, we will be able to calculate the total mass and energy of
   our universe. This means we can determine the age and fate of our
   universe.

   When: The actual balloon launch will take place between December 25 and
   January 15. The flight will take about 2 weeks.
