   UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR VETERANS CLAIMS MISC. NO. 6-01 IN
   RE: RESCISSION OF MISC. NO. 4-00, IN RE: VETERANS CLAIMS ASSISTANCE ACT
   OF 2000 Before KRAMER, Chief Judge, and FARLEY, HOLDAWAY, IVERS,
   STEINBERG, and GREENE, Judges. O R D E R Pursuant to the authority of
   38 U.S.C. ยง 7264(a) and Rules 2, 36, and 41(a) of the Court's Rules of
   Practice and Procedure, the Court has determined that there is a need
   to issue a general order rescinding Miscellaneous Order 4-00, In Re:
   Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, 15 Vet.App. 27 (2000) (en banc
   order) [hereinafter Misc. No. 4-00]. Misc. No. 4-00 established certain
   special procedures (including the automatic recall of nonfinal
   judgments in Court decisions that had affirmed decisions of the Board
   of Veterans' Appeals) and suspended the application of certain Court
   rules in order for appellants and potential appellants to become
   familiarized with the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, Pub. L.
   No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (Nov. 9, 2000) (VCAA). The dissemination of
   information about the VCAA over the past nine months obviates the need
   for the special procedures established by Misc. No. 4-00. Accordingly,
   the Court will rescind Misc. No. 4-00 and thus reinstate the full
   applicability of the Court's rules to all cases. In view of the
   foregoing, it is ORDERED that, effective on September 14, 2001, Misc.
   No. 4-00 is RESCINDED. In the interim, the operation of the first
   ORDERED paragraph of that order (relating to, inter alia, the recall of
   nonfinal judgments) is hereby SUSPENDED effective immediately. The
   Clerk of the Court will, in cases pending before the Court on the date
   of the issuance of this order, send (at the time the Court would
   otherwise make its next communication in each such case) a copy of this
   order to every party in such cases to whom the Clerk has sent a copy of
   Misc. No. 4-00, and will take additional steps to accomplish the widest
   possible dissemination of information about this order. DATED: August
   31, 2001 BY THE COURT: KENNETH B. KRAMER Chief Judge
