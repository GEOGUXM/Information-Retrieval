   The USGS Federal-State Cooperative Program funds statewide, regional,
   and local monitoring and interpretive projects that are relevant to the
   cooperator and to National interests and needs. The USGS may provide up
   to 50 percent of the funding for this cooperative work. About 80
   percent of the Michigan District's work is funded through the
   Federal-State Cooperative Program.
   The name of this program is somewhat misleading, because public
   agencies of any size and Indian tribes can participate in this
   cooperative program. Below are listed the names of city, county, state,
   tribal, and other agencies with which we cooperatively fund
   water-resources programs in Michigan. Names that are underlined are
   links to those agencies' web pages.
