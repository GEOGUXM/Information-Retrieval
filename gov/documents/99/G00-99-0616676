   Career Opportunities

   NETL is committed to obtaining and maintaining a diverse workforce of
   the highest caliber. We value the participation of employees from
   diverse groups in all levels of our organization. The annual Equal
   Employment Opportunity (EEO) plan sets forth strategies and actions to
   increase diversity at NETL and to effectively recognize and utilize all
   employees. Our goal is to create and maintain a diverse environment
   where employees are encourage to contribute creative ideas, seek
   challenges, assume leadership roles and are supported in meeting and
   exceeding both business and personal objectives.

   Understanding and embracing differences in values, styles and
   perspectives is essential to reaching our highest potential as an
   organization, a team and as individuals. We know that each person is
   unique - with different skills, backgrounds and perspective. Every
   individual brings a distinct combination of talents and experiences to
   the workplace.

   To accomplish these objectives, we believe in:
     * Respecting differences in life experiences, cultural backgrounds,
       and work and life styles;
     * Recognizing and supporting employee needs for work/family life
       balances;
     * Assuring equal opportunity and fair employment practice; and
     * Creating a work force, at all levels, that reflects the diversity
       of our customers and the population at large.
