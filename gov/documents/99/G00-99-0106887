     D
   irect and FFEL Stafford Loans are the Department's major form of
   self-help aid. Direct Stafford Loans are available through the William
   D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program and FFEL Stafford
   Loans are available through the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL)
   Program. The terms and conditions of a Direct Stafford or a FFEL
   Stafford are similar. The major differences between the two are the
   source of the loan funds, some aspects of the application process, and
   the available repayment plans.

   Under the Direct Loan Program, the funds for your loan are lent to you
   directly by the U.S. government. If your school does not participate in
   Direct Loans, the funds for your loan are lent to you from a bank,
   credit union, or other lender that participates in the FFEL Program.
   The Direct and FFEL programs also offer PLUS Loans for parents of
   dependent students and Consolidation Loans.
