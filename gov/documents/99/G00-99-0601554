  Overview:

   The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is the first mission
   dedicated to measuring tropical and subtropical rainfall through
   microwave and visible infrared sensors, and includes the first
   spaceborne rain radar.

   Tropical rainfall comprises more than two-thirds of global rainfall. It
   is the primary distributor of heat through the circulation of the
   atmosphere. Understanding rainfall and its variability is crucial to
   understanding and predicting global climate change. Our current
   knowledge of rainfall is poor, especially over the oceans. By use of a
   low-altitude orbit of 217 miles (350 kilometers), TRMM's complement of
   state-of-the-art instruments will provide more accurate measurements.
   These new measurements will increase our knowledge of how rainfall
   releases heat energy to drive atmospheric circulation.

   TRMM's orbit will range between 35 degrees north and 35 degrees south
   of the equator, allowing TRMM to fly over each position on the Earth's
   surface at a different local time each day. Scientist can use data from
   this kind of orbit to calculate rain variations over a 24-hour period;
   the result will be a data set vastly more informative than any now
   available

   TRMM is a joint project between the United States and Japan. The
   National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) will provide the
   Precipitation Radar (PR) and an H-II rocket planned to launch the
   TRMM observatory in the fall 1997 for a 3-year mission. NASA's Goddard
   Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland, will provide the
   observatory, four instruments, integration and test of the observatory,
   the science data processing system, and will operator the TRMM
   satellite via the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS).

  TRMM Science Objectives

   TRMM science objectives are the following:
    1. To obtain and study multiyear science data sets of tropical and
       subtropical rainfall measures;
    2. To understand how interactions between the sea, air, and land
       masses produce changes in global rainfall and climate;
    3. To improve modeling of tropical rainfall processes and their
       influence on global circulation in order to predict rainfall and
       variability at various period of time; and
    4. To test, evaluate, and improve satellite rainfall measurement
       techniques.

  TRMM Observatory and Instruments

   GSFC will design, build and test the observatory "in house" at its
   Greenbelt, Maryland facility. At launch, the observatory will weigh
   7,290 lbs (3,600 kg). It is about 17 feet tall (approximately 5 meters)
   and 12 feet (3.6 meters) in diameter. A gallium arsenide solar
   array/nickel cadmium battery power subsystem will provide 1,100 watts
   of load power to the satellite.

   A three-axis attitude control subsystem will stabilize the observatory
   and keep the instruments pointing toward Earth to within 0.2 degrees. A
   command and data handling subsystem will provide onboard commanding,
   data collection, processing and storage. This subsystem will use
   state-of-the-art technology employing a fiber optic data bus and solid
   state recorders.

   A reaction control subsystem will maintain the orbit at approximately
   217 miles (350 km). Data for each orbit will be stored on board and
   transmitted to the ground by the communication subsystem through TDRSS
   once per orbit. The observatory instruments for primary rainfall
   measurements are a precipitation radar, a multifrequency microwave
   radiometer and a visible/infrared radiometer. For observations related
   to precipitation, NASA has added a Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) and a
   Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES). A brief
   description of the five instruments follow:
     * The Precipitation Radar (PR) will determine the vertical
       distribution of precipitation by measuring the "radar reflectivity"
       of the cloud system and the weakening of a signal as it passes
       through the precipitation. A unique feature of the PR is the
       measurement of rain over land, where passive microwave channels
       have more difficulty.
     * The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is a multichannel radiometer, whose
       signals in combination can measure rainfall quite accurately over
       oceans and somewhat less accurately over the land. The TMI and
       PR data will yield the primary precipitation data sets.
     * The Visible Infrared Scanner (VIRS)
       measures radiance in five bandwidths from the visible through the
       infrared spectral regions. Scientists use Infrared (IR) data to
       make rough estimates of tropical precipitation. The VIRS, PR and
       TMI data will help improve the techniques by which scientists use
       IR data from other satellites to calculate rainfall. This is the
       third component of TRMM's rain package.
     * The Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) is an optical telescope and
       filter imaging system that will investigate the distribution and
       variability of both atmospheric and cloud-to-ground lightning over
       the Earth. These instruments will contribute to our understanding
       of storm dynamics and will be correlated to levels of precipitation
       and the release of latent heat.
     * The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) is a
       visible/infrared sensor designed especially to measure energy
       rising from the surface of the Earth and the atmosphere including
       its constituents (e.g., clouds and aerosols). This energy, when
       balanced t the energy received by the Earth from the Sun,
       constitutes the Earth's radiation budget. Understanding the
       radiation budget, from the top of the atmosphere to the Earth's
       surface, is important to understanding climate and its variability.

  Science Data Retrieval and Transmission Process

   TRMM has its own unique Science Data and Information System (TSDIS) at
   the GSFC to process the information from the satellite. TSDIS will
   analyze the rainfall data and also provide validation from nearly a
   dozen ground radar sites. The data products will be available to the
   science community from the Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center
   (GDAAC) about 6 months after launch.
     * TRMM data will be provided on five levels, on a scale of zero to
       four, representing the different processing done at each stage
       after GSFC receives the data. Level zero is the time ordered and
       quality checked raw data received from the satellite. The higher
       levels result from combining hardware and software calibrations
       with the data to form the final products.
     * Through TSDIS, GSFC will provide preprocessing of rainfall data
       (PR, TMI, VIRS) and all ground data transmit it to appropriate
       centers and to the GDAAC archives.
     * The data also will be transmitted to Japan, where higher level
       processing will be performed at NASDA's Earth Observation Center
       (EOC). It will then be distributed to scientists in the fields of
       climatology, meteorology, hydrology and other disciplines in Japan
       and the United States.
