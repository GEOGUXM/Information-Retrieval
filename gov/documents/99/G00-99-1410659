  Abstract

   Estimates of peak-flow magnitude and frequency are required for the
   efficient design of structures that convey flood flows or occupy
   floodways, such as bridges, culverts, and roads. The U.S. Geological
   Survey, in cooperation with the Nebraska Department of Roads, conducted
   a study to update peak-flow frequency analyses for selected
   streamflow-gaging stations, develop a new set of peak-flow frequency
   relations for ungaged streams, and evaluate the peak-flow
   gaging-station network for Nebraska. Data from stations located in or
   within about 50 miles of Nebraska were analyzed using guidelines of the
   Interagency Advisory Committee on Water Data in Bulletin 17B. New
   generalized skew relations were developed for use in frequency analyses
   of unregulated streams. Thirty-three drainage-basin characteristics
   related to morphology, soils, and precipitation were quantified using a
   geographic information system, related computer programs, and digital
   spatial data.

   For unregulated streams, eight sets of regional regression equations
   relating drainage-basin to peak-flow characteristics were developed for
   seven regions of the state using a generalized least squares procedure.
   Two sets of regional peak-flow frequency equations were developed for
   basins with average soil permeability greater than 4 inches per hour,
   and six sets of equations were developed for specific geographic areas,
   usually based on drainage-basin boundaries. Standard errors of estimate
   for the 100-year frequency equations (1percent probability) ranged from
   12.1 to 63.8 percent. For regulated reaches of nine streams, graphs of
   peak flow for standard frequencies and distance upstream of the mouth
   were estimated.

   The regional networks of streamflow-gaging stations on unregulated
   streams were analyzed to evaluate how additional data might affect the
   average sampling errors of the newly developed peak-flow equations for
   the 100-year frequency occurrence. Results indicated that data from new
   stations, rather than more data from existing stations, probably would
   produce the greatest reduction in average sampling errors of the
   equations.
