      The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. ยง 552, generally
      provides that any person has a right of access to federal agency
      records, unless the records (or any portion of the records) are
      protected from disclosure by one of FOIA's nine exemptions or by one of
      three special law enforcement record exclusions.

      The Federal Reserve Board (Board) maintains public and nonpublic
      records. Public records are available at the Board's conventional
      reading room and electronic reading room. A FOIA request is not
      required to obtain these materials.

      The submission of a FOIA request is required to obtain nonpublic
      records. If you cannot locate the records or information you seek on
      the Board's web site, you may wish to file a FOIA request (making a
      request).

      You can find an overview of the Federal Reserve System in The Federal
      Reserve System: Purposes & Functions, which the Board publishes.
      Additionally, information about the Federal Reserve System as well as
      general guidance to consumers on matters related to the Board's
      activities can be found at brochures. For information from other
      federal banking regulators, you may want to search the following web
      sites:
        * Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
        * Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
        * Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS)
        * Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)
