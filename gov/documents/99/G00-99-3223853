   NEWSROOM

   The Newsroom not only contains current information, but is also an
   archive for news items from the past.

   In our Features section, you can get more details about the items
   currently featured on our home page, and discover more about past
   features. These are designed to inform you about things that are going
   on right now, in the oceans around you, and to highlight some of the
   practical applications of the data that's being collected. If there's
   something you'd like to see featured, let us know...maybe your
   suggestion will appear on the home page!

   The Press Releases let you know what's "in the news" as far as oceans,
   ocean surface topography, and our missions are concerned. You can view
   the current press releases or check out news items from previous years.

   Lectures/Talks provide information about where and when there will be
   lectures and talks both live and over the web.
