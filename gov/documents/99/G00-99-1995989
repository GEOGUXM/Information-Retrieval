      SUBJECT: Designation of Emergency and Non-Emergency Employees for
          Periods of Inclement Weather or Other Temporary Closings
   __________________________________________________________________

  PURPOSE

     This issuance describes the policies and procedures for the
     designation of emergency Clinical Center employees and their leave
     status during periods when NIH is temporarily closed. It also
     describes the NIH Washington, D.C. area closure and early dismissal
     procedures for non-emergency employees (including employees
     telecommuting from an alternative worksite) in the event of
     inclement weather or other disruption.

  POLICY

     The Clinical Center's patient care services and functions must
     continue regardless of the temporary closing of NIH and other
     federal agencies due to inclement weather, massive power failures,
     or other disruptions. Therefore, specific Clinical Center employees
     are designated as emergency employees in carrying out these
     functions and are expected to report to or remain at work during
     such temporary federal closings.

     All other Clinical Center employees, not specifically designated in
     writing to be emergency employees, are considered to be
     non-emergency employees and subject to closure and early dismissal
     procedures outlined by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

     The designation of emergency employees is at the discretion of each
     CC department head.

  PROCEDURES:

    A. EMERGENCY EMPLOYEES

     1. Designation of Emergency Employees

     CC department heads are to develop plans outlining the designation
     of emergency employees in the event of hazardous weather or other
     emergency situations.

     2. Annual Notification of Emergency Employees

     Each CC department head must notify its emergency employees of this
     designation in writing, preferably when they first enter on duty and
     in October of each year. Emergency employees must also be given a
     copy of the departmental emergency employee plan, which should
     include the responsibilities, requirements, and expectations
     associated with that status (see "Sample Notification of Emergency
     Personnel").

     3. Emergency Employee Responsibilities

     All emergency employees are required to report for duty as scheduled
     or as instructed by their supervisors regardless of any general
     announcement (i.e., internet, radio, television) that federal
     employees are not required to report to work.

     Each emergency employee is responsible for providing his or her
     transportation to and from work. It might be advisable for emergency
     employees who car pool to have an alternative transportation plan
     when circumstances require reporting to or remaining at work in
     adverse conditions. Additionally, the Clinical Center coordinates a
     4-wheel drive transportation network during inclement weather. (See
     policy A92-6 Use of Government Four-Wheel Drive)

     Any emergency employees who are unable to report to work must call
     their supervisor within one hour before the start of their shift.
     The supervisor will evaluate employees' individual situations and
     decide on the type of leave the employee will be charged (see 4
     below).

     Individual emergency employees may be detailed to other areas of the
     hospital to support the patient care mission.

     The cooperation of emergency employees in carrying out their
     important responsibilities even under adverse conditions is
     appreciated, but federal regulations do not provide for premium pay
     or compensatory time for emergency employees, even if others at NIH
     are excused from work.

     The Clinical Center provides accommodations for patients, families,
     and staff who are unable to leave the Clinical Center during
     inclement weather. (See Previous policy 1-23: "Emergency
     Accommodations and Transportation.") Emergency employees who remain
     on campus during an emergency period beyond their tour of duty are
     eligible for pay only if they actually work during this period,
     e.g., merely staying at the Clinical Center does not convey pay
     eligibility if the employee is not assigned work or is not in a duty
     status.

     In accordance with established guidelines, special alternative
     arrangements may be negotiated with handicapped individuals who
     would have difficulty commuting during hazardous weather conditions.

     4. Leave and Excused Absence of Emergency Employees

     If a designated emergency employee is unable to report for duty, his
     or her supervisor will determine the type of leave charge to be made
     (annual leave, sick leave, LWOP). The Office of Human Resources
     Management (CC/OHRM) should be consulted in questionable cases. No
     employee will be charged AWOL automatically because he or she was
     not able to report for duty.

     Emergency employees who report late because of unusually hazardous
     weather conditions and/or transportation difficulties resulting from
     those conditions may be excused by the supervisors without charge to
     leave when late arrival is deemed unavoidable and the employee has
     made reasonable effort to arrive on time.

     In certain work areas a designated emergency employee may be excused
     by the supervisor after reporting to work and no charge to leave
     will be made (see 5 below).

     5. Supervisory Discretion in the Early Dismissal of Emergency
     Employees

     When a decision is made to dismiss federal employees during the
     workday, an employee in actual duty status at the time of dismissal
     may be excused by the supervisor even though he or she is designated
     as an emergency employee. When an emergency employee is excused from
     duty after the early dismissal, no leave charge will be made.
     Employees are considered to be in actual duty status if they are:

     a. on duty at the time of dismissal; or
     b. on duty when the agency issues formal notification of the
     scheduled early dismissal, but have requested and been granted leave
     between notification and actual dismissal.

     The definition of a day is midnight to midnight, therefore, evening
     and night shift employees are to be treated similarly to day shift
     employees.

    B. NON-EMERGENCY EMPLOYEES

     1. Disruptions Before the Workday Begins for Non-Emergency Employees

     If a disruption occurs before the workday begins, OPM will provide
     an announcement to the media by 6:00 a.m., whenever possible.
     Employees should listen to reporting information broadcast on local
     radio and television stations or check OPM's website at
     http://www.opm.gov. At that time OPM will provide one of the
     following five announcements. Only the italicized statements will be
     announced. Supervisors and non-emergency employees are responsible
     for being aware of the meaning of each announcement.

     Federal agencies in the Washington, DC are OPEN; employees are
     expected to report for work on time. This means federal agencies
     will open on time and all employees are expected to report for work
     as scheduled. (NOTE: OPM frequently does not make an announcement
     when no changes are required in federal operations.)

     Federal agencies in the Washinton, DC area are OPEN under an
     UNSCHEDULED LEAVE policy. This means federal agencies will open on
     time, but employees not designated as emergency employees who cannot
     report for work may take annual leave or LWOP, without the prior
     approval of their supervisors, for a portion of or the entire
     scheduled workday. Employees should inform their supervisors of
     their intentions. Employees designated as emergency employees are
     expected to report for work on time.

     Federal agencies in the Washington, DC area are OPEN under a DELAYED
     ARRIVAL policy. Employees should plan to arrive for work no more
     than ## hours later than they would normally arrive. This means
     federal agencies will open on time, but non-emergency employees may
     adjust their normal arrival time consistent with the announcement.
     For example, if an employee normally arrives at work at 8 a.m. and
     is directed to arrive no more than 2 hours late, the commuter would
     be granted excused absence from 8 a.m. until 10 a.m. Employees who
     arrive for work more than ## hours later than their normal arrival
     time will be charged annual leave or LWOP for the additional period
     of absence. Employees designated as emergency employees are expected
     to report for work on time.

     Federal agencies in the Washington, DC area are OPEN under a DELAYED
     ARRIVAL/UNSCHEDULED LEAVE policy. Employees should plan to arrive
     for work no more than ## hours later than they would normally
     arrive, and employees who cannot report for work may take
     unscheduled leave. This means federal agencies will open on time,
     but non-emergency employees may adjust their arrival time consistent
     with the announcement. Non-emergency employees who arrive no more
     than ## hours late will be excused without loss of pay or charge to
     leave while those who arrive more than ## hours late will be charged
     annual leave or LWOP for the additional period of absence.
     Non-emergency employees who cannot report for work may take annual
     leave or LWOP without the prior approval of their supervisors.
     Employees should inform their supervisors if they plan to take
     annual leave or LWOP. Employees designated as emergency employees
     are expected to report for work on time.

     Federal agencies are closed. This means federal agencies are closed
     and employees not designated as emergency employees are excused from
     duty without loss of pay or charge to leave. Employees designated as
     emergency employees are expected to report for work on time.

     2. Disruptions After the Workday Begins for Non-emergency Employees

     If a disruption occurs after the workday begins, OPM will provide an
     announcement to the media and on their website at
     http://www.opm.gov.

     Federal agencies in the Washinton, DC area are operating under an
     EARLY DISMISSAL policy. Employees should be dismissed by their
     agencies ## hours earlier than their normal departure time from
     work. This allows non-emergency employees to leave work early
     relative to their normal departure times. For example, if a 3-hour
     early dismissal is announced by OPM, employees who would normally
     leave work at 5 p.m. would be authorized to leave at 2 p.m.

    C. EMPLOYEE RIGHTS

     Employees have the right, through the DHHS grievance procedure or
     the negotiated grievance procedure, if applicable, to challenge
     either the designation of emergency or any decision made concerning
     charged leave.

    D. NEGOTIATED UNION CONTRACTS

     In the event this policy is in conflict with a negotiated agreement
     in those areas with exclusive recognition, the union contract will
     become the controlling document.
