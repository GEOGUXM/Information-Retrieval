   The Department of Transportation's (DOT) Research and Special Programs
   Administration (RSPA), acting through the Office of Pipeline Safety
   (OPS), administers the Department's national regulatory program to
   assure the safe transportation of natural gas, petroleum, and other
   hazardous materials by pipeline. OPS develops regulations and other
   approaches to risk management to assure safety in design, construction,
   testing, operation, maintenance, and emergency response of pipeline
   facilities. Since 1986, the entire pipeline safety program has been
   funded by a user fee assessed on a per-mile basis on each pipeline
   operator OPS regulates.
