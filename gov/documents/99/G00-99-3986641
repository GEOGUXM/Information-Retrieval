           THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE ON NATURAL ZEOLITES (ICNZ)


   The International Committee on Natural Zeolites (ICNZ) was created as
   an ad hoc organization at Zeolite '76, the International Conference on
   the Occurrence, Properties, and Utilization of Natural Zeolites, held
   in Tucson, Arizona, June 6-14, 1976. Its stated purpose was and still
   is to promote and encourage the growing interest in natural zeolite
   materials throughout the scientific and technical community. In its
   twenty-two-year history, ICNZ has served as a focal point of worldwide
   interest in natural zeolites and has been instrumental in the
   organization of conferences, field trips, symposia, and special
   sessions at national and international meetings on the subject of
   natural zeolites. It collects no dues; its treasury comes from
   publication sales, private donations, and funds remaining from
   conference activities.


   In 1977, ICNZ members played key roles in the development of a short
   course for the Mineralogical Society of America entitled "Mineralogy
   and Geology of Natural Zeolites", and in 1979, a symposium on natural
   zeolites was held through the efforts of its members at the annual
   meeting of The Clay Minerals Society (CMS) in Bloomington, Indiana. A
   similar symposium was held at the annual CMS meeting in Jackson,
   Mississippi, in 1986. Its members were also instrumental in the
   production of a special issue of Clays and Clay Minerals devoted to
   natural zeolites in 1981. ICNZ collaborated with the International
   Zeolite Association in sponsoring the 5th International Zeolite
   Conference in 1980 in Naples, Italy, and contributed to the
   organization of the 6th International Zeolite Conference held in Reno,
   Nevada, in 1983. Prior to the Reno Conference, Zeo-Trip '83 was
   conducted by ICNZ, and a Field Guide was published on important zeolite
   deposits in Idaho, Oregon, and Nevada.


   In 1982, ICNZ sponsored Zeo-Agriculture '82, a Conference on the Use of
   Natural Zeolites in Agriculture and Aquaculture, in Rochester, New
   York. This conference was the first of its kind and brought together
   agronomists, plant scientists, animal nutritionists, aquaculturalists,
   and agricultural engineers to discuss the recent efforts being made to
   increase agricultural productivity through the use of natural zeolites.
   ICNZ received financial support for this conference from the U.S.
   Geological Survey, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department
   of Agriculture, and 23 industrial organizations in the United States.


   ICNZ also sponsored Zeolite '85, an International Conference on the
   Occurrence, Properties, and Utilization of Natural Zeolites, held in
   Budapest, Hungary, in August 1985, under the auspices of the Hungarian
   Academy of Sciences. This meeting was attended by zeolite workers from
   31 countries. Zeo-Trip '87, an Excursion to Selected Zeolite and Clay
   Deposits in Southwestern New Mexico and Eastern Arizona, October 22-25,
   1987, following the annual meeting of The Clay Minerals Society in
   Socorro, New Mexico, was organized by ICNZ, and a field guide was
   published for the localities visited. ICNZ organized a special session
   on cation-exchange applications of natural zeolites at the 1989
   International Zeolite Conference in Amsterdam and participated in the
   planning of the field trip that followed the meeting. It sponsored,
   with the Cuban Academy of Sciences, Zeolites '91, the 3rd International
   Conference on Natural Zeolites, held in Havana, in April 1991. In 1993,
   it organized in Boise, Idaho, Zeolite '93, the 4th International
   Conference on the Occurrence, Properties, and Utilization of Natural
   Zeolites, papers from which make up the conference volume of the same
   title. A field guide for Zeo-Trip '93, held immediately after the
   conference was published by ICNZ. It was a co-sponsor of the 1995 Sofia
   Zeolite Meeting, an International Symposium and Exhibition on Natural
   Zeolites that was held in Sofia, Bulgaria, and co-sponsored the 5th
   International Conference on Natural Zeolites in Ischia (Naples), Italy,
   in 1997.


   An ICNZ "newsletter" was previously distributed periodically to several
   hundred scientists and engineers throughout the world who are involved
   with or interested in the origin, occurrence, properties, and uses of
   natural zeolites. The ICNZ home page and an electronic mailing list
   will take the place of the earlier mailed newsletter. ICNZ has also
   made available to interested parties a 15-minute video tape of a
   Bulgarian film on zeolites and has awarded registration-fee
   scholarships to students attending zeolite-related conferences. In
   1994, ICNZ reprinted Mineralogy and Geology of Natural Zeolites, volume
   4 of the Mineralogical Society of America's series Reviews in
   Mineralogy, and the out-of-print Zeo-Agriculture: Uses of Natural
   Zeolites in Agriculture and Aquaculture, both of which are currently
   available. Under the joint auspices of the ICNZ and the Mineralogical
   Society of America, a totally new book on natural zeolites will be
   published as a new volume in the Reviews in Mineralogy series in 1999.
