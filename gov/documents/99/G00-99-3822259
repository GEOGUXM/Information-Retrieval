   Cesar Chavez
   Cesar Chavez was honored for his life long contribution and work on
   behalf of migrant and seasonal workers by induction into the Labor Hall
   of Fame in 1999.

   The library set up several displays in the main lobby in honor of the
   event. The displays contained a chronicle of Mr. Chavez's life in three
   stages.

   Included in the display were books about Chavez, and children's books
   to be donated by Secretary Herman to the Day Care center in Mr.
   Chavez's honor. Several artifacts such as original pennants of the
   Labor movement and Pamphlets from the Cesar Chavez Foundation were
   showcased as well as objects and papers from the private collection of
   Elaine Graves.

   Library are displaying and presenting articles that showcase the
   "Americans with Disabilities Act". The law, which was passed on July

   neglected for so long.

   the Frances Perkins building issued their first report entitled
   "Recharting the Course" in November of 1998. Items contained in the
   cases for display include copies of the legislative history,books and
   pictures and other interesting artifacts relating to the passage of the
   law.
