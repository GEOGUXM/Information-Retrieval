          Welcome to the California State Senate's redistricting web page.

       Every ten years, after the national census, California is required
   to redraw the political boundary lines for the State Legislature, the
   State Board of Equalization and California Congressional districts.
   This site contains information regarding the State Senate's
   redistricting process, the link to the Institute of Governmental
   Studies, to acquire California's redistricting data, and the link to
   the State Senate site for electronically submitting redistricting
   plans.

   In order to view the new Senate and Congressional district maps, please
