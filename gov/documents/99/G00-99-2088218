   Since 1960, the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) has been one of
   the world's premiere particle accelerators, well known for the three
   Nobel Prizes won as a result of research performed there.

   The AGS name is derived from the concept of alternating gradient
   focusing, in which the field gradients of the accelerator's 240 magnets
   are successively alternated inward and outward, permitting particles to
   be propelled and focused in both the horizontal and vertical plane at
   the same time. Capable of accelerating 25 trillion protons with every
   pulse, and heavy ions such as gold and iron, the AGS is used by 850
   users from 180 institutions from around the world annually.

   The AGS receives protons from Brookhaven's 200 million electron-volt
   (MeV) linear accelerator (LINAC).   The AGS Booster, constructed in
   1991, further augmented the capabilities of the AGS, enabling it to
   accelerate protons and heavy ions to much higher energies than before.
   Even now, the applications for the AGS continue to be expanded with the
   construction of the Booster Applications Facility (BAF).

   Among its other duties, the AGS is now used as an injector for the
   Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.
