         The South Florida Water Management District is pleased to offer
   their visitors a number of free Screen Savers. The Screen Savers are
   intended for Win95/98/NT desktops. In time, new topics and images may
   be added.
         Because the District's Mission centers on saving and/or restoring
   Central and South Florida's irreplaceable water resources and unique
   environments, the District decided to offer this software free of
   charge to our public. In this way, we are sharing visions of what we
   are working to preserve and protect.
         The District is not responsible for the use and/or distribution
   of these Screen Savers. As a public service, we are offering them to
   you free of charge to download. Acceptance of these files is the user's
   responsibility for both their execution and support.
         The Screen Saver program is an enhancement to your current Screen
   Saver. The program does not change your desktop operating system in any
   way. Note: The SFWMD Screen Savers work best with suspend mode disabled
   on your PC. This option may already be enabled on laptop computers. To
   turn suspend mode off on either Desktop or Laptop computers, go to the
   Screen Saver properties tab and uncheck the suspend mode box. The
   program is free of charge and you may add additional library sets if
   you choose. Please see our disclaimer for further information.
         Each Screen Saver gives you the power of manipulating the visual
   presentation of each screen. Pick one of the beautiful images and save
   it as the background or wallpaper on your desktop. If you have never
   downloaded before, or you just need a little help, we suggest reading
   the helpful instructions page.
