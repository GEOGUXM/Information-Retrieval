                                   for the
                     NASA Research Announcement Entitled

   "Opportunities to Participate in NASA Mission to Planet Earth and Earth
              Observing System Science and Education Programs"
     __________________________________________________________________

   Background

   In September, 1995, the Office of Mission to Planet Earth (since
   renamed the Earth Science Enterprise) at the National Aeronautics and
   Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters issued a research announcement
   (NRA-95-MTPE-03) soliciting research and education proposals. Five
   types of proposals were requested by this announcement. The deadline
   for submission of proposals was December 1995.

   The objective of this Announcement was to solicit and select
   investigations to complement existing NASA Research and Analysis and
   the EOS investigations by; 1) selecting a science team for Landsat 7;
   2) filling gaps in the expertise of existing science teams for NASA
   Research Facility instruments/missions; 3) providing opportunity for
   new investigations to address scientific issues not covered well by
   existing EOS Interdisciplinary Science Investigations; 4) establishing
   a New Investigators Program to support recent Ph.D. graduates pursuing
   research in support of Earth Science Enterprise objectives; and 5)
   establishing science education and communication grant supplements to
   foster effective communication of scientific results.

   The overall goal that the selected proposals share with other
   investigations funded by NASA was to improve our understanding of the
   Earth as a coupled and integrated system, how it responds to natural
   and human-induced perturbations, and how this response manifests itself
   as global changes.

   NASA received 309 proposals in response to this announcement. Each
   proposal was evaluated by scientific peers including representatives
   from government, academia, industry and the international
   Earth-observation community. NASA then selected, from the ones viewed
   as acceptable by peer evaluators, those proposals needed to accomplish
   its mission objectives.

   THE LANDSAT SCIENCE TEAM

   This announcement solicited team members and a team leader proposals to
   conduct basic research, develop new and innovative methods of
   extracting information content of Landsat observations for global
   change studies, and guide the development of the follow on to the
   Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) instrument. All selected
   investigators are official members of the Landsat Science Team. Landsat
   7 launched in April, 1999. The selected science team will also evaluate
   the quality of data acquired by other land-surface imaging missions
   sponsored by other U. S. Government agencies and private industry in
   assessing future alternatives in addressing the Landsat observations-
   continuity requirement. NASA received a total of 41 proposals and the
   selected Team Leader and Members are:
