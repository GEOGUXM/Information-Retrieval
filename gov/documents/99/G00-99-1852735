                The I-Team GeoSpatial Information Initiative

                                [biteams.jpg]

   The I-Team Geospatial Information Initiative (I-Team Initiative) is a
   joint project of the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC), Federal
   Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Council for Excellence in
   Government, Urban Logic, TIE, NSGIC, NACO, and other strategic
   partners. Part of the next phase of efforts to build a National Spatial
   Data Infrastructure (NSDI),  the I-Team Initiative addresses the
   institutional and financial barriers to development of the NSDI.  It
   aims to offer a coherent set of institutional and financial incentives
   to make it easier for all levels of government and the private sector
   to collaborate in the building of the next generation of framework
   data.  By aligning participant needs and resources, the I-Team
   Initiative will help all levels of government and the private sector to
   save money, migrate from existing legacy systems, make better user of
   existing resources, and develop the business case for additional public
   and private resources.
