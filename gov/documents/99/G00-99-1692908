Backups  - PCS Supported Systems



   Windows NT servers that are supported by the Computing Division PC
   Support group are supported with a centralized backup system. The
   backup system is only used to backup the central servers of our
   clients, and not individual workstations. Users are expected to put all
   of their data onto their associated server. It is the individual users
   responsibility to backup any data that is kept on their local desktop
   system.



What is Backed Up

   The Central backup system will backup all data on the NT servers
   supported by the PCS group. This includes NT based central servers
   including the IMAP and POP e-mail servers. The following are not backed
   up by the central backup facility:


               Oracle Databases

               Exchange Databases

               Open files that are opened with an exclusive lock.


   In many cases, the backup server will be able to backup files that are
   open. Only select applications open files with an exclusive lock. For
   example, documents opened with Microsoft Word can be backed up while
   they are open, but data opened with Microsoft Excel cannot. To ensure
   your data is backed up, users should close all applications before
   leaving their desktop for any length of time.


   File permissions also play an important role for backups. The backup
   server must have permissions to see all of the files in order to back
   the data up. The backups run under an account that has Domain Admin
   rights, hence it is mandatory that users do not remove the ‘Domain
   Admin’ or the administrator account rights on the permissions of their
   files. If the backups are not able to access a file because of lack of
   permission rights, an exception is noted in the backup report that is
   sent to the appropriate server manager. It is the server manager’s
   responsibility to rectify any of these discrepancies.



   Cycle of Backups

   Backups are run during evening hours to reduce the network overhead and
   decrease the odds of attempting to backup open user data. The exact
   times that backups are run varies based on the data loads. The cycle
   for backups is as follows:


               A full backup of all central servers is performed once a
   week. This is traditionally run during each weekend, starting on Friday
   evening.


               Incremental backups are performed Monday thru Thursday
   evening. These backups only backup data and files that have been
   changed since the previous full or prior incremental backups.


   Backups are written to a high-grade reliable tape media. Tapes rotation
   is as follows:


               Incremental backup tapes are kept for at least 2 weeks.


               Full backups are kept for at least 6 weeks, with the 1^st
   Friday of the month full backups being retained for one year. Tapes
   that are retained for the full year are kept at the FCC tape vault. All
   other tapes are either in the tape libraries/loaders or are kept in a
   secured area outside of the WH7 computer room.


               Tapes use a simple external label system to help identify
   the data. All ‘Monthly’ full backups begin with the letter M followed
   by the numeric month (IE 02 for February). Regular weekly full backups
   are labeled with a ‘W’ and Daily incrementals are initialized with the
   letter ‘D’. A database of all the tapes used and their associated data
   files is maintained on-line by the backup software. Tapes can also be
   scanned by the backup software to determine the tapes contents.


               With the volume of data we maintain, several restores are
   performed each week. This random amount of restoration aids in the
   verification of the reliability of backups. Backups are also run with
   the ‘Checksum’ option, which adds to the data integrity. This option
   calculates a checksum for each data stream and saves this data onto the
   tape. A separate ‘verify’ job can be run against the tape to validate
   the integrity of the data.


               Server managers are responsible to ensure that backups are
   performed for their servers. Server managers are provided with a daily
   report(s) of their servers regarding the backup activity. Server
   managers are responsible for reviewing these reports and ensuring their
   system was backed up.



Restoration of Data

               The PCS server managers handle restoring of data. Users are
   required to contact their PCS support representative for restore
   requests. All PCS server managers have access to the central backup
   facility and are trained in the necessary tools to perform restoration
   of data to their server. All PCS server managers have authorization to
   retrieve tapes from the FCC tape vault.
