The Copyright Notice

   For works first published on or after March 1, 1989, the law provides
   that copyright notice in a specified form "may be placed on all
   publicly distributed copies from which the work can be visually
   perceived." Use of the copyright notice is the responsibility of the
   copyright owner and does not require advance permission from the
   Copyright Office.

   The required form of the notice for copies generally consists of three
   elements:
    1. One of
          + the symbol (letter "C" in a circle), or
          + the word "Copyright", or
          + the abbreviation "Copr.",
    2. the year of first publication, and
    3. the name of the owner of the copyright.

   Example: "Copyright 1995 Cole Publishing Company."

   The notice is to be affixed to the copies "in such manner and location
   as to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright."

   Works first published prior to March 1, 1989 must carry the notice or
   risk loss of copyright protection.

   For information about notice requirements for works published before
   March 1, 1989, or other copyright information, write:

     Information Section

     Washington, DC 20559-6000.

Instructions for Individual Fields

  "Reference Tag"

   A Reference Tag is a text string which you may assign at your option to
   this Copyright Registration Application and which may be used in
   referring to the Application in future correspondence, if any.

   Once assigned, it cannot be changed. You are responsible for making
   sure that it is unique among Copyright Registration Applications filed
   under your Deposit Account. Confusion is likely to result if it is not
   unique.

  Title of This Serial

   Every work submitted for copyright registration must be given a title
   to identify that particular work. If the copies or phonorecords of the
   work bear a title or an identifying phrase that could serve as a title,
   transcribe that wording completely and exactly on the application. Give
   the Volume and Number of the periodical issue for which you are seeking
   registration. The "Date on Copies" field should be the date appearing
   on the actual copies (for example: "June 1995", "Fall 1995"). If
   possible, give the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN).

   Indexing of the registration and future identification of the work will
   depend on the information you give here.

  Author/Owner of the Copyright

   Since this form is to be used only in cases of works made for hire, the
   Author/Claimant (copyright owner) named here must be the Employer.

  Date of First Publication

   Do not confuse "creation" with "publication". This form can be used
   only if the work has been published and was first published in the
   United States.

    Publication

   The statute defines "publication" as "the distribution of copies or
   phonorecords of a work to the public by sale or other transfer of
   ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending"; a work is also "published"
   if there has been an "offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to
   a group of persons for purposes of further distribution, public
   performance or public display."

   Give the full, exact date (month, day, year) when publication of this
   issue first took place.

  Year in which creation of this issue was completed

   Under the statute, a work is "created" when it is fixed in a copy or
   phonorecord for the first time. Where a work has been prepared over a
   period of time, the part of the work existing in fixed form on a
   particular date constitutes the created work on that date. The date you
   give here should be the year in which this particular issue was
   completed; it must be no later than the publication date given.

  Correspondence

   These fields should contain the name, address, telephone number, FAX
   number (if any), and email address of the person who should receive any
   such correspondence about this application as might become necessary.
   Completion of the email address field is mandatory.

  Deposit Account

   If you have already established a Deposit Account, enter the Deposit
   Account Name and Deposit Account Number in the fields provided.

   Otherwise, you must establish a Deposit Account with the Copyright
   Office before this form can be submitted electronically. For more
   information, see Circular 5: How to Open and Maintain a Deposit Account
   in the Copyright Office .

   Your account will be debited a filing fee of $30.00 for each
   registration.

  Mail Certificate To

   Currently, the Copyright Office returns a paper certificate through the
   U.S. Mail to the name and address given in these fields.

  Special Handling

   Special Handling requests through CORDS will be available during the
   testbed only for original registration applications (i.e. not for
   additional certificates or other fee services). Requests for fee
   services other than original registrations must be made outside of the
   CORDS fee processing. You may, however, request an additional
   certificate of the CORDS Special Handling claim to be provided when the
   original certificate is provided. To do so, request the additional
   certificate in the Examiner Comment box of the electronic Form TX, and
   the fee will be debited manually outside of CORDS, but the additional
   certificate will be provided at the same time as the original
   certificate.

   The special handling of a registration application can be requested
   only under specific circumstances and is granted only in the most
   urgent of cases. Special Handling for CORDS cases will not be granted
   for claims when the request is made after CORDS has initially received
   the claim. CORDS will process special handling requests if they are
   made at the time of initial submission, but the requests are still
   subject to Copyright Office approval. An additional fee of $500.00 is
   subtracted from your account for each special handling request.

  Note to Examiner

   This is the place to give any comments specific to the claim, the
   application, or the deposit copy.

  Whom to Contact for Rights and Permissions

   These (optional) fields are for the name, address, daytime telephone
   number, FAX number (if any), and email address of the person or
   organization to contact for permission to use the work.

Explanations of Terms

  Creation

  Publication

  Serials

   A serial is defined as a work issued or intended to be issued in
   successive parts bearing numerical or chronological designations and
   intended to be continued indefinitely. This class includes a variety of
   types of works, such as periodicals, newspapers, annuals, and the
   journals, proceedings, transactions, etc., of societies.

  Collective Work

   The term "collective work" refers to a work, such as a serial issue, in
   which a number of contributions are assembled into a collective whole.
   Two categories of authorship are inherent in the creation of collective
   works:
     * authorship of the collective work as a whole, and
     * authorship of the individual contributions to the collective work.

   Authorship of the collective work as a whole includes the elements of
   revising, editing, compiling, and similar authorship that went into
   putting the work into final form.

   The author of a serial issue as a whole is sometimes an individual
   person. More typically, however, the author is the organization
   (corporation, society, club) that directed the preparation of the
   entire serial issue as a "work made for hire." In this case, the
   employer's authorship includes not only the collective authorship
   (described above) but also any individual contributions that employees
   of the employer prepared while working within the scope of their
   employment.

   A claim in the "collective work" under Nature of Authorship means that
   this author either
     * created the compilation, editorial revision, and possibly some
       individual contributions, or
     * employed other(s) who created this authorship.

  A "Work Made for Hire"

   A work made for hire is defined as:
     * A work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her
       employment, or
     * A work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution
       to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other
       audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a
       compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer
       material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree
       in a written instrument signed by them that the works shall be
       considered a work made for hire.

   The Employer is the Author of a work made for hire.

  "Form Templates"

   A Form Template is a partially completed Copyright Registration Form
   which is stored for repeated use, thus eliminating the necessity of
   re-typing identical data from one Copyright Registration to the next.
   It is provided for use by anyone who frequently or regularly submits
   Copyright Registrations, in cases where some of the data on the
   Registration Form (e.g., Deposit Account Number, Claimant's name and
   address, etc.) remains the same from one submission to the next.

   To create a Form Template, open the desired form (TX, SE, PA, etc.) and
   complete only those items which will be identical in all of your
   submissions. Then, instead of clicking the "Submit" button at the
   bottom of the form, click "Save Form As Template".

   The form will be quickly re-posted, and a window will appear which
   advises you to use your browser's "Save As" facility to save your form.
   Click "OK" to close this window.

   To save your Form Template using your browser's "Save As" facility, you
   will have to enter the name of a file in which to save it. IMPORTANT:
   The filename should end with ".htm" or ".html". You should not use the
   default filename supplied by the browser.

   Once this is done, in the future you can simply open the
   partially-completed Form Template, using your browser's "Open"
   facility, instead of invoking the blank Copyright Registration Form
   (TX, SE, PA, etc.).

   PLEASE NOTE:
     * There is no error-checking of the data used in the Form Template at
       the time the Template is created. The data will, of course, be
       error-checked when it is used in an actual submission.
     * Should any of the data in the Template be incorrect or become
       outdated, the Template can always be overwritten with a corrected
       one by following these same steps.
     * IMPORTANT: Be sure to click Save Form As Template before using the
       browser's "Save As" facility to store the Template. Otherwise, the
       Template will contain no data.
