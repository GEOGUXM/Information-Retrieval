       Enabling the future of air and space transportation

  Our programs are responsive to the most important needs of our
  Enterprise goals. Since the Enterprise has adopted a set of stretch
  goals, turning goals into reality is an ongoing process that requires
  the Enterprise to learn and adapt over time. Our program strategy
  supports this process with a balanced set of programs performing both
  fundamental and applied research. As NASA's role is limited to
  technology development, all of our programs are planned and implemented
  in coordination with the industry, Department of Defense and Federal
  Aviation Administration partners to ensure that program deliverables
  are transferred in a timely manner for further development and
  implementation.
