                                  Ecological Effects of Fishing


   P ressures are the result of human activities that create stress on the
   natural environment. Together with societal actions (responses) to
   improve the environment or mitigate adverse impacts, they determine the
   environment's state or condition. Pressures result from normal social
   factors such as increases in population and economic development and
   growth. These bring demands for water, waste disposal, and raw
   materials, increase pollutant discharges to water and air, and change
   uses of land, often degrading or fragmenting natural habitats. Absent
   mitigation, these pressures can create environmental conditions that
   can seriously compromise natural biophysical systems. As the essay on
   Population: Distribution, Density and Growth clearly shows,
   environmental pressures are far from evenly distributed; our coastal
   systems carry the largest burden and that burden is constantly
   increasing.

   Sometimes the effects of pressures on environmental quality are simple
   and obvious. The use of certain types of fishing gear described in the
   essay Ecological Effects of Fishing can have immediate, visible impacts
   (pressure) on bottom habitat. The effects of bycatch on fish
   populations in the same essay is a similar case in point. The obvious
   effects of pressures are also evident in the essay on Population at
   Risk from Natural Hazards which explores the relationship between
   population growth and development in counties subject to hurricane
   events and the sharply increasing economic losses from natural
   disasters.

   More often, the impacts of human activities are much more difficult to
   discern. The complex mosaic of biological, chemical, and physical
   processes that comprise any single coastal ecosystem can be affected to
   varying degrees by a variety of human activities, or the human system.
   Even when the science of these processes and their interrelationships
   is well understood (and it often isn't), it is very difficult to
   identify those activities within the human system that are the major
   factors in environmental degradation. Nevertheless, identifying and
   quantifying pressures, that is, accurately describing the human system,
   is a necessary component to improving our understanding of the coastal
   environment.
