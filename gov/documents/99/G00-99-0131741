                      SCI QUERI TRANSLATION PLAN FY2001

   Increasing Influenza Vaccination Rates in the Veteran SCI/D Population

   SCI QUERI is currently focused on its translation plan (HSR&D QUERI SDP
   #SCT 01-034-01; PI:  Frances M. Weaver, PhD and Barry Goldstein, MD,
   PhD), which is a pilot project focused on increasing the rates of
   influenza vaccination in the VA spinal cord injury and disorder (SCI&D)
   population.  A multifaceted intervention was implemented at 4 VA SCI
   Centers using a combination of reminders and education materials
   (provider and patient) and recruitment of local clinician champions
   from October 2000-March 2001.  A quasi-experiment, pre- and post-test
   design with a matched comparison group will be used to assess the
   impact of the intervention on provider behavior and patient behavior
   and outcomes.  Data will be collected using medical record review,
   patient surveys, and review of VA healthcare administrative
   databases.   Provider behavior will be assessed through the
   determination of vaccination rates at intervention sites. Patient
   behavior will be assessed through a mailed survey to persons with SCI&D
   followed by each of the 8 study SCI Centers.  Patient outcomes
   including:  morbidity and mortality due to respiratory problems,
   outpatient clinic visits and inpatient admissions for
   respiratory-related problems, length of stay (LOS) for inpatient
   admissions for respiratory illnesses, and decreased requirements for
   ventilator support amongst people with higher-level tetraplegia will be
   tracked and compared over time and by intervention v. control.  The
   cost benefit will also be assessed.  Data on outcomes and impact will
   all be collected by August 2001.  SCI QUERI expects to report impact by
   December 2001.

   Hypotheses for this study include:

   H1.  Influenza vaccination rates for persons with SCI&D will increase
   significantly at intervention sites following a multi-pronged
   intervention effort compared with influenza vaccination rates during
   the prior year at the same sites.

   H2.  Rates of influenza vaccination in the SCI&D population will be
   significantly higher at intervention sites than at comparison sites for
   the current immunization season (i.e., vaccination period October 2000
   thru January 2001).

   H3.  Frequency of outpatient clinic visits for respiratory-related
   problems, rates of inpatient admissions for respiratory conditions and
   inpatient mortality due to respiratory conditions will each be
   significantly lower at intervention sites during the FY2001 flu season
   than at the comparison sites.

   H4.  Total costs of care attributable to respiratory-related illnesses
   for the current flu season (i.e., December 2000 through April 2001)
   will be significantly lower at intervention sites than comparison
   sites, including the cost of the intervention.

   The ultimate goal is to reduce the incidence and complications of
   influenza among veterans with SCI&D.  As a result of decreased cases of
   influenza in this population, potential reductions in morbidity and
   mortality and ultimately improved quality of life will result.  In
   addition, this pilot project will be expanded nationally for
   FY2002-2003.
