   The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) gives you the right to access any
   Department of the Interior (DOI) records unless the information in
   those records is protected by one of nine exemptions and (1) disclosure
   is prohibited by law or Executive order, or (2) disclosure could result
   in harm to an individual, commerical entity, or the Government.

   If you are seeking general information about DOI or one of its bureaus
   or offices, you may wish to visit DOI's home page or contact the Office
   of Communications/Public Affairs for the appropriate bureau. The
   information you are seeking may be available already in one of DOI's
   reading rooms or via Internet. If it is not, you will need to submit a
   written FOIA request to DOI. If you have questions on what information
   is available without submitting an FOIA request or where it may be
   located, contact one of the FOIA Contacts. Our responsibility is to
   provide you with copies of the documents you are entitled to receive
   under the law. We want to work with you to achieve that goal.
