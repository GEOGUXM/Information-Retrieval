   I. Background and Statement of Issues
   The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) has
   developed this public health response plan (PHRP) to outline actions by
   ATSDR to address public health issues regarding the Stauffer Chemical
   Company Site in Tarpon Springs, Florida. These issues were raised by
   the December 29, 2000, "Ombudsman Report of Findings and
   Recommendations Regarding the Stauffer Chemical Company Site, Tarpon
   Springs, Florida" (the Ombudsmans report).

   To address the outstanding public health questions and concerns
   regarding the Stauffer Chemical Company site, ATSDR will conduct a
   number of public health activities including developing a new public
   health assessment. ATSDRs activities, which are discussed in detail
   below, will be coordinated with the Tarpon Springs community, the
   Florida Department of Health (FDOH), the Florida Department of
   Environmental Protection (FDEP), the U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency (EPA), and health and environmental authorities from Pinellas
   and Pasco counties. ATSDRs public health activities will focus on
   working with the community to evaluate possible exposure to site
   contaminants and the potential public health impacts, to investigate
   the health status of potentially exposed groups (former workers and
   former students of Gulfside Elementary), and to provide health
   education and other activities, as appropriate, to help protect the
   communitys health and well-being.

   II. Planned Public Health Activities
   To address concerns expressed by the community, and brought forward in
   the Ombudsmans report, the activities described below are currently
   planned:

     A. Public health assessment
     B. Community involvement activities
     C. Preliminary health study activities
     D. Environmental health education

   In addition to activities currently planned, other activities may be
   conducted on the basis of available data and concerns expressed by the
   community.

   A. Public Health Assessment

     Purpose: To evaluate human exposures to contaminants associated with
     the Stauffer Chemical Company site and their potential public health
     impacts.

     Anticipated Timeline: ATSDR plans to complete the draft public
     health assessment and release it for public comment by summer 2002.

     ATSDR Actions: ATSDR plans to develop a new public health assessment
     for the Stauffer Chemical Company site. As part of the public health
     assessment process, ATSDR will conduct the following activities:

     1. Review available environmental sampling data and information on
     the site to identify contaminants of concern and determine whether
     completed human exposure pathways exist;
     2. Review available health outcome data for the Tarpon Springs
     community, including rates of disease (e.g., cancer);
     3. Identify and evaluate health concerns of the community;
     4. For completed exposure pathways, determine potential public
     health hazards associated with human exposure to site contaminants
     based on evaluation of (a) toxicological data for contaminants of
     concern in completed exposure pathways, (b) available health outcome
     data, and (c) reported community health concerns;

     5. Identify any actions needed to protect the community from
     exposure to site contaminants;
     6. Identify significant gaps in environmental data that prevent
     evaluation of human exposure pathways, and work with appropriate
     agencies (e.g., EPA, FDEP, and Pinellas and Pasco counties) to
     obtain the necessary data.

     During the health assessment process, ATSDR will address the
     following specific issues raised by the ATSDR Ombudsman and the
     Tarpon Springs community:

     Asbestos Use at the Stauffer Plant
     * Although loose asbestos was apparently used at the Stauffer
       Chemical plant in the early years (i.e., late 1940s, 1950s, and
       early 1960s), sampling data from past asbestos investigations have
       not shown any significant presence of asbestos in site soils or
       slag or in soils at Gulfside Elementary School. ATSDR will continue
       to investigate the issue of whether asbestos used at the plant
       impacted the surrounding community and will evaluate whether
       additional sampling is needed to determine the potential for
       exposure to asbestos.

     Air Emissions/Dispersion Modeling
     * ATSDR will review available air emissions data and air monitoring
       data and use air dispersion modeling, if possible, to evaluate past
       exposure of the Tarpon Springs community and Gulfside Elementary
       School students to air emissions from the plant.

     Buried Drums
     * Available information indicates that drums containing wastes from
       the Stauffer plant were buried on-site sometime in the past. ATSDR
       will work with EPA to investigate the presence of these wastes and
       their public health significance.

     Health Status of Former Stauffer Workers and Former Gulfside
     Elementary School Students
     * ATSDR will conduct the activities discussed under paragraph C below
       to address concerns regarding the health status of former Stauffer
       workers and former students of Gulfside Elementary School.

     Radiation and Off-Site Slag
     * ATSDR will review individual radiation dose measurements performed
       by the Pinellas County Health Department in 1999 for residents
       living in the vicinity of the Stauffer Chemical plant.
     * ATSDR will determine whether additional radiation monitoring is
       needed to address community concerns regarding radiation exposures
       from slag in the community.

     Meyers Cove
     * Available information indicates that part of Meyers Cove was filled
       by Victor Chemical and/or Stauffer Chemical sometime in the past.
       ATSDR will review available surface water, sediment, and fish
       sampling data to determine the public health impact of site
       contaminants in Meyers Cove and the Anclote River. ATSDR will also
       determine whether additional sampling of surface water, sediment,
       or fish is needed to evaluate exposure pathways associated with
       site contaminants in the cove and the river.

     Military Maneuvers
     * According to EPA and Stauffer Management, there is no evidence that
       military maneuvers were ever conducted at the site.
     * ATSDR will continue to investigate whether military maneuvers
       occurred and, if so, whether any information exists to evaluate
       their public health significance.

     Munitions Manufacturing
     * According to Stauffer Management, there is no evidence that
       munitions were ever manufactured at the Stauffer plant.
     * ATSDR will continue to investigate whether munitions manufacturing
       occurred and, if so, whether any information exists to evaluate
       their public health significance.

     Sinkholes
     * ATSDR will review available information from the site geophysical
       investigation to determine whether sinkhole activity could result
       in contamination of drinking water supplies and possible human
       exposure to site contaminants.

     Uranium Extraction/Recovery
     * According to EPA, Stauffer Management, and the U.S. Department of
       Energy (DOE), there is no evidence that uranium extraction/recovery
       was ever conducted at the site.
     * ATSDR will continue to investigate whether these activities
       occurred and, if so, whether any information exists to evaluate
       their public health significance.

     Water Supply Wells
     * ATSDR will work with EPA and Pinellas and Pasco counties to
       identify residential supply wells in the site area and to determine
       which wells could be affected by site contaminants; ATSDR will
       review available sampling data for those wells and work with EPA
       and the counties to obtain sampling data for wells where the data
       are not available.
     * ATSDR will review available EPA groundwater investigation results
       and other resources to answer outstanding questions about potential
       exposures to drinking water from area supply wells.

   B. Community Involvement

     Purpose: To ensure that the Tarpon Springs community and community
     groups, such as the Pinellas Pasco Technical Advisory Group
     (Pi-Pa-Tag) and the Anclote Citizens Advisory Group (ACAG), are
     fully involved in ATSDRs public health activities.

     Anticipated Timeline: These activities will coincide with
     established public health activities.

     ATSDR Actions: ATSDRs community involvement activities will include:

     1. developing a community involvement plan to ensure that
     site-related public health activities are coordinated with community
     members to address their public health concerns in a proactive and
     responsive manner;
     2. meeting with community members to obtain information about the
     site and to identify further their site-related health concerns; and

     3. developing communication strategies and messages based on direct
     community involvement.

   C. Preliminary Health Study Activities

     1. For former Gulfside Elementary School students:

     Purpose: To determine whether a health study is appropriate and
     feasible by investigating whether students who attended Gulfside
     Elementary from 1978-1981 can be identified and located and by
     evaluating their past exposures.

     Anticipated Timeline: These activities are currently in the planning
     stages.

     ATSDR Actions: While the public health assessment is being
     conducted, ATSDR will determine the feasibility of identifying and
     locating former Gulfside Elementary students. ATSDR will use county
     and school records to determine the number of students who were
     enrolled at Gulfside Elementary from 1978-1981 and to obtain their
     names. ATSDR will then attempt to obtain current addresses for the
     former students.

     By determining (1) how many of the former students can be identified
     and located and (2) whether the students were exposed to hazardous
     substances at levels that could have been harmful, ATSDR will be
     prepared to decide whether a health study is appropriate and
     feasible.

     2. For former Stauffer Chemical Company workers:

     Purpose: To determine whether a health study is appropriate and
     feasible by investigating whether former Stauffer Chemical Company
     workers can be identified and located and by evaluating their past
     exposures.

     Anticipated Timeline: These activities are currently in the planning
     stages.

     ATSDR Actions: While the public health assessment is being
     conducted, ATSDR will determine the feasibility of identifying and
     locating former Stauffer workers. ATSDR will use employment records
     to determine the number of people who worked at the Stauffer
     Chemical Company plant and to obtain their names. ATSDR will then
     attempt to obtain current addresses for the former workers.

     By determining (1) how many former Stauffer workers can be
     identified and located and (2) whether the workers were exposed to
     hazardous substances at levels that could have been harmful, ATSDR
     will be prepared to decide whether a health study is appropriate and
     feasible. ATSDR will consult with the National Institute of
     Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in making its health study
     decisions regarding the former Stauffer workers.



   D. Environmental Health Education

     Purpose: To increase knowledge and awareness of both the community
     and health care providers about the site as it relates to possible
     environmental exposure and protection of public health.

     Anticipated Timeline: These activities will be ongoing during the
     development of the new public health assessment (PHA) and will
     continue based on recommendations within the PHA.

     ATSDR Actions: ATSDR will work with community and state partners to
     develop appropriate education for identified target audiences
     regarding known or potential environmental health impacts from the
     site. These education efforts will provide information on
     contaminants of concern, as well as past, present, and future
     potential health impacts as a result of living near the site (based
     on the findings of the new public health assessment).

     Proposed health education activities include:

     1. Conducting a community needs and capacities assessment. The
     community needs and capacities assessment is conducted to involve
     community members in the health education process and to identify
     community information such as priority concerns related to the site,
     gaps in knowledge, resources and collaborating groups, culture and
     demographics, and other community-specific information.

     2. Identifying target audiences. On the basis of the findings in the
     community needs and capacities assessment, target audiences for
     health education activities will be identified. Two key audiences
     are local health care providers and the community residents. Other
     audiences may include former workers, teachers, and members of
     grass-roots organizations.

     3. Developing and implementing health education activities for
     identified target audiences. Activities will include environmental
     health education and training for local health care providers
     working within the community. Training materials, including
     toxicological data associated with chemicals of concern, will be
     made available (e.g., ATSDRs case studies in environmental medicine,
     toxicological profiles, and chemical fact sheets). Environmental
     health education activities for the community at large will also be
     conducted and implemented in conjunction with local health care
     providers and with community advice and guidance. Education
     activities directed toward other identified targeted audiences will
     be planned and implemented as more information from the needs and
     capacities assessment and public health assessment becomes
     available.
