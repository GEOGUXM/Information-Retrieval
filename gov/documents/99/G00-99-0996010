   Some 90% of all presidentially declared disasters are weather related,
   leading to around 500 deaths per year and nearly $14 billion in damage.
     To help Americans guard against the ravages of severe weather, the
    National Weather Service has designed StormReady, a program aimed at
    arming America's communities with the communication and safety skills
                    necessary to save lives and property.
