                    Object Oriented Technology in Aviation
     __________________________________________________________________

   If you are currently or soon to be involved in developing or approving
     aviation software products using Object Oriented Technology - this
                            workshop is for you!
     __________________________________________________________________

   An increasing number of aviation software developers are using or
   considering using Object Oriented Technology (OOT). However, exactly
   how OOT fits into the context of RTCA/DO-178B "Software Considerations
   in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification" is not clear. The
   purpose of this workshop is to bring together people from the FAA,
   industry, military, and research community to determine what
   OOT-specific issues exist for aviation software and to draft position
   papers for each major issue. These position papers will be considered
   by the FAA in drafting advisory material on using OOT.

   Workshop registration is now available, as is information about the
   location and how to get here.

   Current List of Issues & Comments

   As of December 18, 64 issues and comments about OOT have been submitted
   to this web site. Topics of concern include inheritance (single and
   multiple), dynamic binding/dispatch, inlining, templates, structural
   coverage, dead/deactivated code, and tools. You may view the current
   issue list here.

   We are still accepting comments on OOT. If you have concerns that are
   not included in our current list, please let us know. If you have
   solutions to propose, we want to know that, too. Visit here to tell us
   what you think.

   Draft positions will be developed on each major OOT topic based on the
   submitted statements. These drafts will serve as the basis for breakout
   sessions at the workshop.
