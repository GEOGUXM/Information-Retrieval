                  MILITARY OPERATIONS/ FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS
     __________________________________________________________________

                          MILITARY TRAINING ROUTES
   (MTR's)

   In recognition of military operational and training requirements, the
   Department of Defense (DOD) has been authorized to conduct flights in
   excess of 250 knots below 10,000 feet MSL.

   The operation of these flights is restricted to certain established
   routes:

   1. VR (VFR routes) - conducted when the ceiling is at least 3,000 feet
   and flight visibility is five miles or more.

   2. IR (IFR routes) - conducted on IFR flight plans regardless of
   weather conditions.

   3. SR (slow speed low altitude routes) - conducted VFR below 1,500 feet
   at 250 knots or less, without prior notice.

   VR, and IR routes are depicted on ENROUTE LOW ALTITUDE (FLIP) CHARTS
   and DOD AREA PLANNING charts. SR routes are depicted on DOD AREA
   PLANNING charts ONLY.

   Upon request, CONROE AFSS will furnish pertinent information on these
   routes during weather briefings and radio communications. When enroute,
   contact the nearest FSS to ascertain the current status of the MTR's.

                           MILITARY OPERATING AREA
   (MOA)

      This is airspace assigned to separate/segregate certain military
   activities from IFR traffic, and to identify where these activities are
                         conducted for VFR traffic.

   MOA's are published on SECTIONAL, VFR TERMINAL, and LOW ALTITUDE
   ENROUTE charts.

   Upon request, briefers will furnish pertinent information on these
   areas during weather briefings and radio communications. When enroute,
   contact the nearest FLIGHT SERVICE STATION to ascertain current status
   of MOA's.

                              RESTRICTED AREAS

   This is designated airspace, within which flight while not wholly
   prohibited, is subject to restriction. IFR/VFR operations in the area
   may be authorized by the controlling agency.

     Restricted areas are depicted on Enroute and Sectional Charts. Upon
     request, briefers will provide the status of the restricted areas.
