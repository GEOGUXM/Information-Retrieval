      The Experience Factory organizational concept was introduced to
      institutionalize the collective learning of the organization that is at
      the root of continual improvement and competitive advantage. It
      establishes a separate organizational element that supports reuse of
      experience and collective learning by developing, updating, and
      delivering experience packages to the project organization which is
      responsible for developing and maintaining software. This structure
      creates a symbiotic relationship where the
        * Project organization offers to the experience factory its products,
          the plans used in its development, and the data gathered during
          development and operation.
        * Experience packagers transform these objects into reusable units
          and supply them to the project organization, together with specific
          support that includes monitoring and consulting.
