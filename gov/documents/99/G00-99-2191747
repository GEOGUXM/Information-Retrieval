                          Weather Charts on the NET
     __________________________________________________________________

   The NWS Gateway provides access to the latest version of the weather
   facsimile chart they operationally distribute. The charts are not
   altered or enhanced and are in the original black-and-white form used
   by NWS offices. These facsimile products are in a digital G4-1D (T4)
   code as defined in WMO Manual 386 for Global transmission and are
   enveloped in TIFF. You will probably need an external viewer to display
   TIFF files.

   A chart reference guide is provided for your information. Additional
   charts will be added as limited staffing resources permit.
