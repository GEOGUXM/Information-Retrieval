The ATSDR ombudsman is an independent, neutral resource service for all
parties concerned with environmental health disputes involving ATSDR. Finding
enough common ground to establish a workable agreement between each faction
is the ombudsman's primary objective.

When all routine avenues have been exhausted, the ATSDR ombudsman can be
called to impartially investigate, mediate, and assist in areas where the
"system" has failed. In doing so, this office is not an advocate for the
interests of ATSDR, nor is it an advocate for business, nor industry, nor
private citizens, nor any other government entity. It is an advocate for
problem resolution.

   1who.gif (2943 bytes) The ATSDR ombudsman's services are independent,
   and open to all parties - private citizens, citizen advocacy groups,
   corporations, as well as federal, state and local government entities.

   Only three criteria must be met. The caller must
   1. have environmental health concerns involving ATSDR;
   2. believe that they are not being heard; and,
   3. have exhausted all other resources.

   First, and foremost, the ATSDR ombudsman listens , and attempts to
   understand all sides of the issue.

   5_o.gif (1316 bytes)
   Initially, the ATSDR ombudsman recommends and helps the requestor reach
   other government and nongovernment resources for resolution. If these
   have all been tried and the conflict remains, the ATSDR ombudsman takes
   a more active role.

   5_i.gif (733 bytes)
   To get a clear picture of the issues, the ATSDR ombudsman undertakes an
   independent, fact-finding investigation. This includes an impartial
   investigation of governmental decisions as well as a nonjudgmental
   assessment of each party's expectations.

   5_m.gif (606 bytes)
   Based on the facts while being sensitive nontangible issues, the ATSDR
   ombudsman helps all parties find a common ground. When people are no
   longer in a "win-lose" situation, relationships replace conflicts and
   solutions emerge.

   5_r.gif (720 bytes)
   Once a workable agreement is reached, the accord is put in writing and
   signed by all parties. The ATSDR ombudsman also signs the document as
   an observer/witness. If, in spite of all efforts, an agreement can not
   be reached, the ATSDR ombudsman prepares a detailed, written report
   outlining the facts and presenting the ATSDR ombudsman's recommendation
   on the issues and any related matters. This document is then presented
   to the ATSDR Assistant Administrator and is available to the public.

   one.gif (591 bytes)   The ATSDR ombudsman can not
                         impose a solution on any party.
   All resolutions are strictly voluntary. The ATSDR ombudsman is
   independent and has the power to investigate, mediate and recommend,
   but the ombudsman has no power of enforcement .
   two.gif (635 bytes)   The ATSDR ombudsman can not
                         reverse a decision.
   Should the ATSDR ombudsman discover that errors were incurred during
   the ATSDR investigation, appropriate recommendations for corrections
   are presented to the ATSDR Assistant Administrator for action. However,
   the ATSDR ombudsman can not require or ensure the action or outcome.
   three.gif (659 bytes)   The ATSDR ombudsman can not
                           produce miracles.
   Before any conflict can be resolved, each party must be willing to look
   at other sides of the issues. When everyone works together, it is
   likely that each side will walk away with some of what they wanted to
   achieve, but it is unrealistic to expect everything. The goal is to
   find enough common ground to develop a workable agreement that everyone
   can live with.
