                                ODIN Overview

   The Outsourcing Desktop Initiative for NASA (ODIN) is an innovative
   outsourcing contract vehicle available to the Federal government.  The
   GSA offers ODIN to provide Federal clients with the option to transfer
   to the commercial sector the responsibility and risk for providing and
   managing desktop, server, and intra-center communications as assets and
   services for their whole organization .  ODIN provides the Federal
   information technology (IT) manager the opportunity to outsource the
   complete life cycle support of their desktop computing environments.

                                What Is ODIN?

   ODIN provides managed life cycle support services for the
   desktop-computing environment.  The customer matches the computing and
   communications requirements within its organization by first defining
   its user community profiles and then selecting a bundled hardware,
   software, and communications package, or seat, that fits the needs of
   each user community.  Because each seat is a fixed price, the
   organization can better manage its total cost of ownership.  The ODIN
   contract provides the full spectrum of desktop computing resources from
   general purpose to high performance, scientific and engineering
   environments.  The ODIN contract is considered a government-wide
   acquisition contract (GWAC) and is available to any agency authorized
   to use a GWAC.  This multiple award, indefinite delivery/indefinite
   quantity contract was awarded to seven prime contractors.  The ODIN
   contract was awarded in June 1998 for a total of nine years.  The
   period of performance for each delivery order placed against this
   contract cannot exceed three years but can be renewed on a sole-source
   basis as a logical follow-on without further justification.

   ODIN goals...
     * Shift asset management responsibilities and risk from the
       Government to the ODIN Contractor
     * Facilitate information technology management
     * Increase systems and product interoperability across the Agency
     * Allow civil servant resources to focus on core R&D mission
     * Optimize service delivery using commercial best practices
     * Reduce cost of IT services
