   Social Security Administration

   Get an Estimate of Your Social Security Benefits

   The Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement (PEBES) - A
   statement of your lifetime earnings and an estimate of your benefits.
   Make your request online and Social Security will mail you a response.

   Compute Your Own Estimate of Your Social Security Benefits

   This program produces the Social Security "primary insurance amount"
   (PIA) for an old-age, survivor, or disability benefit, given the
   characteristics of a particular worker (such as birth date, past
   earnings, and type of benefit). It also produces the "maximum family
   benefit", the actuarial reduction or increment factor (for early or
   delayed retirement), and the monthly benefit amount (MBA).

   Request Verification of the Social Security Benefits You Receive

   Many people need an official letter verifying the amount of their
   monthly Social Security benefit to establish eligibility for state and
   local assistance programs. This letter can now be requested online, and
   will be mailed to your address of record.

   Request a Replacement of Form 1099, Statement of Benefits Received

   In January of each year, Social Security mails SSA-1099 forms to about
   47 million people who received benefits the previous year. This form is
   used by seniors and other Social Security beneficiaries in preparing
   their Federal income tax returns. Some of these forms become lost or
   mutilated, and the agency expects to receive about 870,000 requests
   this year for replacements. These requests can now be made on the
   Internet, as well as by phone, mail or in person. Beneficiaries don't
   need to request an original SSA-1099 form; these are mailed to them
   automatically each January.  (Top)
