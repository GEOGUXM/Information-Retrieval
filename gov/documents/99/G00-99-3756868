   Page Heading - Industrial Fluids Databases and Chemical Engineering
   Databases

      Providing reliable data on the thermophysical properties of fluid
      mixtures has been a primary area of focus of the SRD Program. A set of
      combined theoretical and empirical predictive techniques have been
      developed that rest firmly on evaluated data.

      These techniques have been tested and incorporated into interactive
      computer programs that generate a large variety of properties based
      upon the specified composition and the appropriate state variables.

      Databases are now available for hydrocarbon mixtures, including natural
      gas, as well as a number of pure and mixed fluids of industrial
      importance. The Thermodynamic Properties of Refrigerants and
      Refrigerant Mixtures Database (REFPROP) continues to be a timely and
      valuable tool for refrigeration engineers, chemical and equipment
      manufacturers, and others who use chlorofluorocarbons. It now provides
      data on 33 pure refrigerants and refrigerant mixtures. CYCLE_D has
      recently been updated.

      The NIST Chemistry WebBook has thermophysical property data for 33
      fluids, including density, enthalpy, internal energy, entropy, etc.
