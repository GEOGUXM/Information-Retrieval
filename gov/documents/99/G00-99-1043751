                    Software
       _______________________________________________________________

     The National Center for Electron Microscopy is pleased to announce
     the availability of software developed at the NCEM for distribution
     to the microscopy community. The software available at this time is
     listed below and can be downloaded to your local computer. As other
     programs are developed and considered useful to the EM community,
     they will be added to the list. At the moment there is no specific
     support mechanism in place and none is envisioned. However bug
     reports are encouraged (email r_kilaas@lbl.gov) and bugs will be
     attended to as time permits. No guarantees can be made to the
     accuracy of the code and no responsibility is taken with respect to
     the usage of the programs. However, the programs are used at the
     NCEM and no known problems exist at the time of posting. A
     description of the programs is also given below.

Macintosh based Image processing and utility routines

     The package below consists of a number of Macintosh based extensions
     to the commercial software "Digital Micrograph" from Gatan, Inc. The
     software is only intended for use with Digital Micrograph Version
     2.5 or later. After downloading the software, double-click on the
     file NCEMPackage.sea. The folder that is created on your computer
     contains two folders, one for 68K and one for PPC machines, plus a
     read me file explaining the installation procedure. There is also
     on-line help available for the software as part of package. Program
     development by Dr. Roar Kilaas and Dr. Sidnei Paciornik. A set of
     routines for holographic reconstruction developed by Dr. John
     Bonevich is included in the package.

     The Focus Determination Package is designed to facilitate the
     determination of the defocus of the objective lens from a single
     HRTEM image containing some amorphous material and to also determine
     the defocus of each image and the focus step between images in a
     through-focus series. Written by Dr. Roar Kilaas.

     A new set of routines for creating digital Moire patterns,
     displacement maps and strain images can be downloaded by clicking on
     the link below. These routines use the concept of the geometric
     phase to calculate deviations in local lattice parameters from
     variations in reciprocal space around chosen spatial frequencies
     (Bragg reflections). On-line help on the routines is available from
     the menu-bar.

NCEM HRTEM Image Simulation Software

     NCEM scientist Dr. Roar Kilaas has developed a general X-window
     implementation of the program NCEMSS which calculates HRTEM images
     based on the multislice approximation. The program is quite flexible
     and supports input of structures, viewing of unit cells, calculation
     of images and diffraction patterns, various layout options, CTFs,
     Pendellossung plots, etc. In general, we try to support as many
     platforms as possible, and the platforms presently supported are
     indicated below. The program and its datafiles together with some
     examples can be obtained through the ftp connections below. On Unix
     machines, the files are contained in tar files while the openVMS
     version consists of a backup file "ncemss.bck". After bringing the
     file across to your machine and saving the file to your disk,
     execute the following: tar xf "filename" - on Unix machines backup -
     under openVMS On Unix systems the executable may have been
     compressed with the gzip utility (extension .gz or .z) in which case
     the file must be decoded using the program "gunzip" which can be
     found on various ftp sites in case your machine does not have a
     local version. Also, the mode of the program must be changed to
     'executable' using the command 'chmod +x ncemss' after decompression
     procedure.
     Comments are encouraged and should be addressed to Roar Kilaas
     (email: roar@lbl.gov).

NCEMSS Version 1.6 - October 1996

     NCEMSS has been upgraded to version 1.6. However, the program has
     not yet been compiled for all platforms mentioned above. We will
     make an effort to support all possible unix platforms, but we don't
     always have access to the appropriate computer, hence the lack of
     availability for all the platforms at this moment.

     ncemss1.6.alpha.osf -ncemss for DEC Alpha Systems running OSF.

     ncemss1.6.sun -ncemss for SUN workstations

     ncemss1.6.ibm -ncemss for the IBM RISC platform

     ncemss1.6.sgi -ncemss for the Silicon Graphics platform

     ncemss1.6.linux -ncemss for running under linux. This version
     compiled on Pentium Cyrix.

     Main differences between the old version and the new

     - Changed how the look up table is being used. This results in a
     much better behavior of the program, it no longer makes all the
     windows outside of the program black.

     - Changed the way images are stored when read back from the display
     and stored as an image. The image files created are now TIFF images.
     There is no longer a need to use the program ImToTiff as for version
     1.4

NCEMSS Version 1.8 - December 2000

     NCEMSS has been upgraded to version 1.8. However, the program has
     not yet been compiled for all platforms mentioned above. We will
     make an effort to support all possible unix platforms, but we don't
     always have access to the appropriate computer, hence the lack of
     availability for all the platforms at this moment.

     Read Me installation instructions (.pdf)

     ncemss1.8.linuxppc -ncemss for the Mac Linux PPC platform

     ncemss1.8.sun -ncemss for SUN workstations

     ncemss1.8.linux -ncemss for running under linux. This version
     compiled on Pentium Cyrix.

     Main differences between the old version and the new

     - Added support for true color

Supplied Datafiles:

     The following files are supplied with the executable program after
     downloading and extractiing the individual files.
     spcgrp.dat - file containing information on the 230 spacegroups.
     microscope.dat - file containing information on predefined
     microscopes. New microscopes can be added by the user.
     scatt.dat - file containing information on the scattering factors
     for the atomic elements.
     lprint.ps - file containing postscript information for use in saving
     data as postscript files or routing of output to a postscript
     laserprinter.
     Read Me files: - ReadMe file or correct installation and operation
     of the program on your platform.
       _______________________________________________________________

     Manuals:

     There are two versions of the manual currently available. One is a
     FrameMaker 4.0 document, the other is in the form of a Adobe
     Portable Document Format file (PDF). We hope to add different
     formats in the near future.
     NCEMSS Manual - FrameMaker 4.0 NCEMSS Manual
     NCEMSS Manual PDF - Adobe Portable Document Format

     Some users find that it is difficult to download the entire document
     in its entire length. Therefore, the manual has been split into
     various sections. There are two groups of files below. The first set
     is in the Adobe Portable Document Format for automatic viewing and
     printing if your netbrowser has been configured to automatically
     launch Adobe Acrobat Reader for files with the extension ".pdf". The
     second set consists of PDF files that have been stuffed and
     bin-hexed and is suitable for either automatic ftp download through
     your web-browser or your favorite ftp program.
