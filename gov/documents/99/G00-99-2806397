   Administrative Hearing Interpreter

   This Web page contains the names of persons who have passed the State
   of California examination for Administrative Hearing Interpreter from
   1979 to present, and Medical Interpreter from September 1993 to
   present, and who have kept their certification current by recertifying
   each year. Administrative Hearing Interpreters and Medical Interpreters
   who have not kept their certifications current have been removed from
   the Master Listing and must retest in order to become certified again.

   State agencies and Superior and Municipal Courts (which provide a
   portion of program funding) are entitled to copies of the Master
   Listing at no charge. Other parties may purchase the Master Listing of
   Administrative Hearing and Medical Interpreters at a cost of $35.
   Payment, in the form of a money order or cashier's check only, should
   accompany written requests for copies.

   You can view the complete listing of Administrative Hearing and Medical
   Interpreters by visiting the Master Listing Database.

   As of December 1995, the Judicial Council/Administrative Office of the
   Courts (JC/AOC) assumed responsibility for publishing the Master
   Listing of Court Interpreters found at
   www.courtinfo.ca.gov/programs/courtinterpreters/master.htm.
