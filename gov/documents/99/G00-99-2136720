   Legislation and Process Improvement
   Several bills will come before the City Council which, if passed, will
   have a major positive impact on the cleanliness of the District of
   Columbia. Granted, these laws alone won't make the city clean, but they
   will put teeth into current litter laws, allowing city officials to do
   a better job of enforcement. It is important that D.C. residents
   support these bills by contacting their Councilmembers, attending
   Council hearings on the bills, and by testifying before the Council
   during hearings. Check this web site or the City Council Calendar to
   find out when public hearings will be scheduled for these bills.
   The Recriminalized Enforcement of Littering Emergency Amendment Act
   provides for criminal liability for littering.
   The Rental Housing Amendment Act
   provides for the prompt removal from public space personal property
   that was forcably removed from rental property in the course of an
   eviction.
   The District of Columbia Litter Control Administration Amendment Act
   authorizes the District to levy and collect special assessments for the
   costs and expenses incurred due to the abatement of nuisances. For
   example, when a property owner allows litter to accumulate on his land,
   and the District cleans it, the property owner will be billed for the
   service. The "special assessment" would be collected at the same time
   and in the same manner as ordinary District real property taxes-- that
   is, annually.
   The Street Sign Regulation Amendment Act prohibits the posting of
   signs, handbills, advertisements, and posters on any public structure,
   private structure, or public space. Any person found in violation would
   be fined $100 to $1000 and may be required to perform community
   service. He/she would also be liable for the cost incurred in removing
   the posters as well as the cost of collection of the fine. Read more on
   this topic. Read what citizens are saying about posters.
   The District of Columbia Anti-Graffiti Amendment Act authorizes the
   Mayor to assume financial responsibility for removing graffiti from
   privately-owned property. The fine for defacing public or private
   property is $250 to $5,000 or imprisonment for up to a year, or both.
