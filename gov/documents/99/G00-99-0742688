   Notice of Modification of the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee
   Schedule On September 19, 2001, the Judicial Conference of the United
   States modified the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule. The
   modification provides that fees for appeals or cross-appeals by
   bankruptcy trustees and debtors in possession in chapter 11 cases be
   payable only from the estate and to the extent that any estate is
   realized. This change to the appellate filing fee will only apply to
   the $100 fee required by the fee schedule and not to the $5 notice of
   appeal fee authorized under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1930(c). This change will take
   effect January 1, 2002.
