   On October 10, 1996, President Clinton and Vice President Gore
   announced their commitment to the Next Generation Internet (NGI)
   Initiative, based upon strong research and development programs across
   Federal agencies. The Large Scale Networking Working Group of the
   Computing, Information, and Communications R&D Subcommittee has drafted

   part of the process for building the strongest possible program among
   academia, industry, and the Government.
