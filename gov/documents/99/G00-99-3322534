   [jvalder.jpg] Jeff Valder was born in Washington, D.C. but was raised
   in Phoenix. He graduated from Brophy Prep and then from the University
   of Arizona where he majored in Regional Development and was a
   placekicker on the football team. Jeff spent several years in the San
   Diego area where he earned a Masters in City Planning from San Diego
   State University. He worked as an Assistant Planner for the Lightfoot
   Planning Group in Oceanside, California and then was an Associate
   Planner for the City of San Diego for three years where he was
   responsible for community and redevelopment planning for several
   urbanized communities within the City.

   In 1993 Jeff, his wife Denise and their three daughters moved to
   Fountain Hills when Jeff began working for the Town of Fountain Hills
   as a Senior Planner. As a Senior Planner Jeff was responsible for the
   Town's long-range planning activities, which have included the
   preparation of a new subdivision ordinance and work on a new general
   plan for the Town. In October 1998 Jeff was promoted to Community
   Development Director after the departure of the Town’s first Community
   Development Director, Gary Jeppson.
