                  Subsidence of Kilauea Volcano, 1983-2001

   View is east toward Halema`uma`u Crater and across the summit caldera
   of Kilauea. The area of maximum subsidence between 1983 and 2001 is
   located about 2 km south (right) of Halema`uma`u (the crater is about 1
   km in diameter). This area has subsided 1.5 m since 1983. The wide
   ground cracks at the lower right are part of the southwest rift zone.

  1983-2001: Leveling surveys reveal pattern of subsidence

   Deformation monitoring of the summit area of Kilauea Volcano has long
   shown brief episodes of inflation and deflation that correlate with the
   movement of magma into and out of the volcano's summit magma reservoir.
   Episodes of inflation occur as magma accumulates in the summit
   reservoir; episodes of deflation occur when magma erupts within the
   caldera (though some caldera eruptions have very little deflation) or
   moves into one of the rift zones, where it sometimes erupts.

   Inflation and deflation of the magma reservoir result in changes in the
   ground surface (see summit tilt pattern during several episodes of the
   Pu`u `O`o-Kupaianaha eruption). For example, an increase in pressure
   within the summit reservoir owing to magma accumulation causes the
   ground surface above the reservoir to move outward and upward away from
   the center of inflation (illustration of inflation-deflation process).
   Several instruments and techniques measure these changes. One of the
   most accurate ways to measure elevation changes is by leveling. We
   conduct leveling surveys at the summit of Kilauea every 1-2 yr or more
   frequently if needed.

   Leveling and other surveys show that the summit area has subsided as
   much as 1.5 m since the beginning of the Pu`u `O`o-Kupaianaha eruption
   in 1983, relative to a benchmark about 3 km northwest of the caldera.
   Between July 1999 and July 2001, the summit continued to subside at a
   maximum rate of 7 cm/yr. In the figures below, we present some of the
   results of leveling surveys since 1983.

   Kilauea summit vertical changes: July 1999 to July 2001

    Map of the summit area of Kilauea Volcano showing vertical changes at
                    specific sites between 1983 and 1998

   Map of benchmarks that form the leveling network around Kilauea's
   summit and across the upper rift zones. Numbers next to each station
   are elevation differences, in centimeters relative to benchmark HVO23,
   between the latest two surveys in July 1999 and July 2001. The area of
   greatest subsidence is in the southern part of the caldera (14 cm near
   station Rebar4).

   Note the location of benchmark Rebar4 along the south rim of the inner
   caldera. Elevation changes at Rebar4 between 1983 and 2001 are shown in
   the figure below.

   Elevation of benchmark REBAR4 relative to HVO23 in meters. The rate of
   elevation change has been relatively steady since 1983, but some
   fluctuations in rate were associated with changes in eruptive activity,
   most notably when the eruption site moved from Pu`u `O`o to Kupaianaha
   in 1986 and then back to Pu`u `O`o in 1992 (see eruption chronology).

   The small increase in elevation in early 1997 followed an episode of
   magma intrusion into the east rift zone and a small, short-lived
   fissure eruption at Napau Crater (see GPS monitoring results for
   information about this episode).

   (95 percent confidence interval). See map above for location of profile

  What's going on? Withdrawal of magma or the movement of Kilauea's south flank
  or both?

   The ongoing subsidence of the summit is thought to result mainly from
   magma movement out of the summit reservoir and into the east rift zone
   at a faster rate than it is being supplied from below (the hot spot
   beneath the Big Island). But other deformation surveys show that the
   subsidence has also been accompanied by the spreading or widening of
   the summit area and deformation of the rift zones. This broader region
   of deformation has led some scientists to suggest that another
   process--the movement of the volcano's south flank--may account for
   some of the subsidence.

   Although the summit area of Kilauea has steadily subsided since the
   beginning of the Pu`u `O`o-Kupaianaha eruption, it has been subsiding
   and spreading (widening) at varying rates since a magnitude 7.2
   earthquake occurred 9 to 10 km beneath the south flank of Kilauea on
   November 29, 1975. The earthquake probably originated as movement of
   the south flank along a broad slip surface defined by the boundary
   between the volcano and the underlying sea floor. Parts of the south
   flank moved suddenly seaward 3 to 8 m and subsided 1 to 3.5 m during
   the earthquake.

   Scientists have long measured the seaward movement Kilauea's south
   flank and noticed correlations with intrusions of magma into the
   volcano's rift zones, eruptions, and large earthquakes. Three main
   hypotheses have been proposed to explain the fundamental cause of the
   south flank's mobility:
    1. repeated forceful intrusion of magma into Kilauea's rift zones,
       which forces the volcano apart
    2. gravitational settling of the entire south flank due to its
       enormous mass
    3. the presence of a deep magma reservoir system beneath the summit
       and rift zones

   Thus, in addition to the withdrawal of magma from the summit reservoir
   since 1983, part of the subsidence and spreading at the summit may also
   be related to continued movement of the south flank since the 1975
   earthquake.

   Deformation of the summit, rift zones, and south flank of Kilauea
   continues to be a major focus of the monitoring program at the Hawaiian
   Volcano Observatory. Ongoing research into the underlying causes of the
   volcano's movement is sure to improve our understanding of how Kilauea
   responds to gravity and its magma reservoir system.
