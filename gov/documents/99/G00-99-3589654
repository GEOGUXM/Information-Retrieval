Achieving Excellence: A Message from the Director

   Dennis H. Smith As the Director of the VA Maryland Health Care System,
   it is my honor to recognize the outstanding achievements, both
   personally and professionally, of our dedicated employees during the
   first year of the new millennium. Thanks to your hard work and
   perseverance this past year, we were able to dedicate a new Mental
   Health Care Building at the Perry Point VA Medical Center, open new
   outpatient clinics in Pocomoke City and Loch Raven, sponsor the first
   Stand Down in Baltimore for homeless veterans and continue to improve
   the quality of health care services we provide each and every day to
   MarylandÂ’s veterans.

   Your dedication and commitment has helped to make the VA Maryland
   Health Care System a leader within the Department of Veterans Affairs
   nationwide. Many of you have been honored for your outstanding
   contributions to this organization. There are also others of you who
   have been recognized for your work in your local communities and
