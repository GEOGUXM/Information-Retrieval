                    Laboratory for Extraterrestrial Physics
                               Brown Bag Seminar

About the Seminar

   The Laboratory for Extraterrestrial Physics (LEP) at NASA's Goddard
   Space Flight Center conducts weekly science seminars. They are held on
   Fridays at noon in the Conference Room (Room 8) in Building 2 at
   Goddard. The topics cover the interests of the Laboratory, including
   astrochemistry, interplanetary physics, planetary systems, planetary
   magnetospheres, and electrodynamics. Since the seminar is conducted
   during the lunch hour, the audience often brings their lunch, hence the
   moniker "brown bag seminar."

Have an Idea for a Speaker?

   The seminar organizers are always appreciative of ideas for seminar
   speakers. Please contact them EARLY to avoid scheduling conflicts.
