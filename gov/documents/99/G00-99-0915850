   .......................Original Equipment Manufacturers vi INTERESTS OF
   AMICI Computing Technology Industry Association ("CompTIA") and
   Association for Competitive Technology ("ACT") are nonprofit trade
   associations. Collectively, CompTIA and ACT represent over 14,000
   companies and individuals in the rapidly converging computing and
   communications industries. Their members include hardware
   manufacturers, software developers, distributors, service companies,
   consulting firms, and information technology ("IT") professionals. This
   court granted CompTIA and ACT leave to participate as amici curiae in
   an order dated November 3, 2000. Amici's members (including Microsoft)
   do business in a rapidly growing technology market that is intensely
   competitive, producing new, better, and progressively less expensive
   products so rapidly that many consumers hesitate making a purchase
   today for fear that a faster, better, and cheaper product will be
   available tomorrow. Market forces determine the winners and losers in
   this fast-paced industry, and consumer choice has frequently
   transformed today's winner into tomorrow's loser. In finding Microsoft
   liable, the District Court misapplied antitrust law in a manner that
   interferes with this process, ignoring the axiom that antitrust laws
   protect "competition, not competitors"1 and threatening real harm to
   consumer welfare. In so doing, the lower court overlooked compelling
   evidence that Microsoft's challenged business practices, many nearly
   universal in the IT industry, were procompetitive, not anticompetitive.
   The District Court compounded its error by granting structural relief
   that will fragment the Windows operating system, retarding its further
   evolution and reducing the usefulness of a "standard" that has been a
   key driver in making this industry so dynamic and competitive. Amici
   see this as a potential 1 Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S.
   294, 344 (1962). disaster, subjecting amici's members to increased
   costs and technological chaos, and consumers to poorer products and
   higher prices. STATEMENT OF THE CASE The extraordinarily dynamic IT
   industry of the last fifteen years has generated enormous benefits for
   businesses and consumers. The decision below threatens to choke this
   dynamism by fragmenting the Windows operating system standard, which
   now supports a steadily increasing range of software applications, and
   by reducing the incentive and ability of leading software firms to
   compete vigorously by adding new functions to existing products. 1.
   Windows as the De Facto Operating System Standard The emergence of
   Windows as a "de facto operating system standard" for personal
   computers was both natural and efficient. Operating systems are
   characterized on the demand side by strong positive "network effects":
   the more widely an operating system is used, the more valuable it is,
   both to consumers and to developers of applications software and other
   complementary products. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 84 F.
   Supp. 2d 9, 20 (D.D.C. 1999) (¶ 39) [hereinafter "Findings of Fact"].
   There are also significant economies of scale on the supply side: an
   operating system developer must make a large initial investment, but
   the marginal costs of duplication and distribution are minimal. The
   combination of network effects and economies of scale make the
   emergence of a single operating system standard both inevitable and
   desirable. Both consumers and software developers have benefited
   greatly from widespread use of Windows as a de facto operating system
   standard. Software developers benefit from reduced cost and risk
   because new programs and functions will run on most personal computers.
   This benefits consumers by "ensuring a large body of applications from
   which consumers can 2 choose." Id. Consumers also benefit because the
   operating system standard reduces their learning costs and gives them
   greater interoperability. Windows has itself evolved, naturally and
   inevitably, to accommodate and sometimes incorporate new applications.
   These improvements benefit both applications developers and consumers.
   Indeed, the District Court acknowledged that the Windows improvement
   that is central to this case - the incorporation of web browsing
   functionality - directly benefited consumers by "increas[ing] general
   familiarity with the Internet" and "improving the quality of Web
   browsing software, lowering its cost, and increasing its availability .
   . . ." Id. at 110-11 (¶ 408) 2. The Nature of Competition in Computer
   Software Strong network effects, strong economies of scale, and the
   nature of software as intellectual property ("IP") combine to make
   competition in computer software markedly different from competition in
   many other sectors. Creating software is risky, requiring large up-
   front investment with no assurance of success. If a product is
   successful, the developer must depend on legal protection of its IP
   rights to earn a return in the marketplace. The temporary "monopoly"
   afforded by IP law is what generates the returns that create the
   incentive to invest in new products. Software competition thus
   necessarily focuses principally on innovation the creation of new IP
   and is characterized by fierce drives to achieve these temporary
   "monopoly"-like market positions. These "monopolies" are inherently
   transitory. The rate of innovation is so great that market leaders are
   regularly leap-frogged by new competitors. Established firms making one
   kind of software often incorporate the functionality of neighboring
   products into their programs, thereby improving their own products but
   also moving into other firms' previously distinct product space. This
   is what happened, for example, when WordPerfect (then the market
   leader) 3 integrated outlining and spell-checking functionalities into
   its word processing program, largely eliminating demand for stand-alone
   outliners and spell-checkers. This phenomenon is not unique to the
   software industry. On the farm, integrating the reaper, tractor, and
   threshing machine created the combine. This spelled the demise of the
   threshing machine as a stand-alone product, but the technological
   advance was certainly good, not bad. Integration of new functions into
   existing products is critical to commercial success in the software
   industry because software is an almost perfectly durable good: unlike
   other products whose makers enjoy repeat sales as goods sold in
   previous periods wear out or are consumed, existing software is
   replaced only when newly available software has such superior
   functionality and performance as to justify the cost of switching. An
   established software firm's strongest competition, therefore, is often
   its own installed base. None of this means that basic antitrust
   principles should not be applied to the software industry. But in
   applying antitrust principles to this industry, as to any industry, the
   courts must be sensitive to its competitive dynamics. It is
   particularly inappropriate for a court, seeking to apply these
   principles to a rapidly changing industry, to rely simply on labels
   such as "tying" or "market allocation" to evaluate the competitive
   merits of single-firm conduct. As the Supreme Court noted in Broadcast
   Music Inc. v. CBS, 441 U.S. 1, 8 (1979), "easy labels do not always
   supply ready answers." 3. Proceedings in the District Court Although
   Windows lawfully acquired its position as the de facto operating system
   standard, the court found that Microsoft had violated Section 2 of the
   Sherman Act by (1) maintaining its operating system "monopoly" through
   exclusionary conduct designed to prevent Netscape's Navigator (with
   Sun's Java) from becoming an effective alternative platform for
   software development, and (2) by attempting to monopolize the market
   for Internet browsing 4 software. The court also held that Microsoft
   violated Section 1 by "tying" its own web browser, Internet Explorer,
   to Windows. In reaching these conclusions, the court relied heavily on
   labels, rather than analysis. It concluded, for example, that
   Microsoft's integration of web browsing functionality into Windows was
   a per se illegal tie without discussing whether such integration
   offered sufficient consumer benefits to require a fuller,
   rule-of-reason analysis. The court compounded this error by relying on
   internal e-mails to find that Microsoft's conduct was motivated by a
   desire to preserve its operating system monopoly and then using this
   evidence of subjective intent to trump any objective analysis of the
   competitive effects of Microsoft's conduct. Finally, the court accepted
   the Plaintiffs' proposal to break Microsoft in two without evaluating
   either the need for or the effects of that remedy and without according
   Microsoft (or the public) an opportunity to be heard. SUMMARY OF
   ARGUMENT This brief argues two points. First, by breaking up Microsoft,
   the District Court risks fragmenting the Windows operating system
   standard in a way that will hinder future product development
   throughout the industry, destroy important network efficiencies, raise
   prices to consumers, and make personal computers both less useful and
   harder to use. Second, the District Court's decision, by misapplying
   the antitrust laws, would impose on the IT industry a set of rules that
   would chill both competition and innovation in ways that, over time,
   will dramatically reduce consumer welfare. The District Court's
   judgment should, therefore, be reversed. ARGUMENT I. Breaking Up
   Microsoft Will Harm the IT Industry and Consumers and Is Not Justified
   by Any Threat to Competition. In a market characterized by steadily and
   substantially declining consumer prices, the District Court
   nevertheless ordered the breakup of Microsoft thereby running the risk
   of 5 destroying a cornerstone of the industry's success, the Windows
   operating system standard. The District Court took this extreme step
   without a hearing on how the breakup would affect the public interest
   and with very limited consideration of whether the remedy is warranted
   by the violations the Court found or is necessary to cure them. Further
   consideration would have demonstrated that (A) the breakup will harm
   the IT industry and consumers and (B) the breakup is not a necessary or
   appropriate remedy for the violations found. A. The Breakup Remedy Will
   Harm the IT Industry and Consumers. In fashioning an equitable remedy
   for an antitrust violation, a court must select the remedy that will do
   "as little injury as possible to the interest of the general public."
   United States v. E. I. du Pont De Nemours & Co., 366 U.S. 316, 327-28
   (1961)(citation omitted). The reason is evident in this case: the
   remedy imposed will directly affect thousands of other companies, shape
   the design of current and future products used by millions of
   consumers, and influence a crucial segment of the national economy. The
   importance of the principle, "First, do no harm" cannot be overstated,
   but the District Court essentially abdicated to the Plaintiffs its job
   of assessing the public interest and they in turn may have been
   influenced by competitors of Microsoft that have vested interests in a
   particular outcome.2 Dissolution of a single company is an extreme
   remedy under the Sherman Act and should be ordered only as a last
   resort.3 This is true for two reasons. Where only a single company, and
   not a combination or conspiracy, is involved (A) its current structure
   is likely to have evolved as a result of efficiencies that will be lost
   in a breakup,4 and (B) the breakup will create problems of 2 See United
   States v. Microsoft Corp., 97 F. Supp. 2d 59, 62 (D.D.C. 2000)
   ("Plaintiffs won the case, and for that reason alone have some
   entitlement to a remedy of their choice."). 3 See United States v.
   United Shoe Machinery Co., 247 U.S. 32, 46 (1918); United States v. E.
   I. du Pont de Nemours, 366 U.S. 316, 327-28 (1961). 4 Kenneth G.
   Elzinga, David S. Evans, & Albert L. Nichols, U.S. v. Microsoft: Remedy
   or Malady? 9 GEO. MASON L. REV. (publication pending 2000) (manuscript
   at 68-77). 6 defining boundaries and duplicating or sharing resources
   that will require ongoing supervision and create new inefficiencies.5
   Both problems are readily apparent in this case where the breakup
   remedy will harm hardware manufacturers, software developers, and
   consumers in six critical ways. First, and most fundamentally, the
   lower court's stated objective of achieving two or more competing
   operating system standards for desktop computing is ill-conceived.
   Although Windows will, in time, be leapfrogged by a fundamentally
   different computing standard, the existence of a de facto standard at
   any given time is both natural and desirable from a consumer
   perspective. If there were multiple standards, software developers
   would be unable to reach the broadest possible range of customers at
   the lowest possible cost: they would have to make products for multiple
   standards or select a single standard at the risk that another will
   prove to be more popular. Either choice would produce greater costs to
   developers, reduce their incentives to innovate, and reduce software
   choices for consumers.6 Second, the remedy will encourage the
   fragmentation of the Windows operating system. If original equipment
   manufacturers ("OEMs") are free to offer customized versions of
   Windows, software developers would have to offer tailored versions of
   their software, or to add basic functionalities, to assure broad
   "Windows compatibility," increasing their costs and frustrating
   consumers expecting standard capabilities and compatibility with other
   products.7 5 See, e.g., United States v. AT&T, 552 F. Supp. 131 (D.D.C.
   1982) (breakup resulting in nearly 15 years of judicial supervision
   over the business operations of AT&T and its progeny). 6 See testimony
   of Mike Devlin, Trail Transcript 2/4/99am, at 30:25 - 31:17 ("There are
   several different Unix platforms. ... [Sun's version of Unix and IBM's
   version] are two platforms in the sense that we have to do special
   engineering and testing for each of those platforms. [A] high
   percentage of our development costs are associated with the things that
   turn out to be different -- in particular, testing and so forth. . .
   .") 7 See, e.g., Stan J. Liebowitz, An Expensive Pig in a Poke:
   Estimating the Cost of the District Court's Proposed Breakup of
   Microsoft, 31 (Sept. 21, 2000) (estimating that "middleware 7 Third,
   the remedy will require ongoing judicial supervision of the product
   design and operational decisions of the two companies created by the
   breakup, and this will delay and frustrate hardware manufacturers,
   software developers, and the consumers whom the antitrust laws are
   designed to protect. Contrary to the District Court's apparent
   assumption that delineation between functionalities is self-evident, it
   is not at all obvious, even to those who work in the industry, which
   present or future functionalities would be allowed to be part of
   Windows, and the IT industry would have to wait for judicial
   interpretations. Fourth, the courts, substituting their judgment for
   consumer-driven market choices, are likely to get these definitions
   wrong, barring the incorporation into Windows of features that have
   greater value to consumers in integrated form. The integration of web
   browsing software into Windows at no additional cost benefited most
   consumers, Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 55 (¶ 186), yet the
   Court's order would require Microsoft to offer a non-integrated version
   as well, United States v. Microsoft Corp., 97 F. Supp. 2d 59, 68
   (D.D.C. 2000). Such relationships are complex and better resolved by a
   market that rewards efficiencies and penalizes extra costs than by a
   court. Fifth, the breakup will likely lead to reduced efficiency and
   higher prices. Because Microsoft's applications and operating system
   products are complementary, Microsoft currently has an incentive to
   charge lower prices for both products than would a firm that made only
   one of them.8 What the court risks is creating two companies, both with
   incentives to charge the highest prices possible and significantly
   reduce innovation, in place of one broad-based, balkanization" would
   increase costs for a typical independent software developer by 16.72%
   of revenues, amounting to an industry cost of $27.4 billion over 3
   years), available at
   http://www.competitivetechnology.org/pubs/remedies3.pdf. 8 This
   phenomenon is referred to by economists as "double-marginalization."
   See, e.g., JEAN E. TIROLE, THEORY OF INDUS. ORG., 174-76 (1988). 8
   innovation-driven company that charges far less for its products.9 That
   outcome will harm consumers and the IT industry. In fact, an economic
   study by a leading expert on network effects estimated that the breakup
   would cost U.S. consumers between $50 billion and $125 billion in
   higher software prices over three years.10 Sixth, innovation in related
   areas of the IT industry will also be reduced. For example, the
   District Court's remedy would assign important components of
   Microsoft's server software (e.g., the database server) to the
   applications company. Those in the industry know that Microsoft has
   brought significant innovation and price competition to the market for
   operating systems and applications for servers, including database and
   transaction management software. Microsoft's approach in this market
   was to price well below the industry leaders and to tightly integrate
   its server applications with the operating system an approach that many
   business customers have embraced. The breakup remedy denies this
   integration and disables the low- cost, innovative competitor, enabling
   the higher-priced incumbent market leaders in the server space, such as
   Sun, IBM, and Oracle, to charge more for less.11 The remedy, therefore,
   will result in consumer harm in an industry segment not considered by
   the court below, and will likely benefit only those companies that
   helped Plaintiffs craft the remedy. This is one of the many examples of
   unintended (at least by the District Court) consequences that would
   have been demonstrated in hearings on remedies or other consideration
   of real world impact. In sum, for reasons similar to the (far simpler)
   case of "Beta" vs. "VHS" video systems, trying to compel competition is
   both counterproductive and unnecessary. Makers of 9 See, e.g., Paul
   Krugman, The Last Refuge, DENVER POST, June 13, 2000, at B11 ("In the
   case of Microsoft, textbook economics says that a breakup of the kind
   now ordered, aside from disrupting the firm itself, will actually
   exacerbate the problem of market power, raising prices and increasing
   market distortions."). 10 See Stan J. Liebowitz, supra note 7, at iii.
   11 See id. at 19-21. 9 complementary products (in the video systems,
   video machines and videotapes), as well as consumers, benefit from a
   single standard in the marketplace. And, as the success of DVD
   technology illustrates, once a superior technology emerges, it can
   rapidly displace the earlier de facto standard. B. The Remedy Is Not
   Justified by Any Harm to Competition. The District Court found that
   Microsoft had, between 1995 and 1997, acted unlawfully to prevent
   rivals Netscape and Java from becoming an alternative platform for
   software development that would erode the so-called "applications
   barrier to entry" in the operating system space. It is undisputed,
   however, that Microsoft did not drive either Netscape or Java from the
   marketplace,12 and there is no finding that Netscape and Java, either
   alone or in combination, would have emerged as a viable software
   development platform, even absent Microsoft's allegedly illegal
   actions.13 A less intrusive remedy for exclusionary conduct would
   therefore be simply to enjoin that conduct, leaving Netscape and Java
   to emerge, if they can, as viable software development platforms.
   Nothing about the history of Netscape or Java suggests that it is
   necessary or in the public interest to break up Microsoft.14 12 See
   Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 103 (¶ 378) (citing AOL estimates
   showing the number of users of Netscape Navigator, which incorporates
   Java, more than doubling over the relevant time period). 13 United
   States v. Microsoft Corp., 87 F. Supp. 2d 30, 44 (D.D.C. 2000)
   [hereinafter "Conclusions of Law"] ("the evidence does not prove that
   they would have succeeded absent Microsoft's actions"). See also
   Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 112 (¶ 411) ("There is insufficient
   evidence to find that, absent Microsoft's actions, Navigator and Java
   already would have ignited genuine competition in the market for
   Intel-compatible PC operating systems."); id. at 110 (¶ 407) ("It is
   not clear whether, absent Microsoft's interference, Sun's Java efforts
   would by now have facilitated porting between Windows and other
   platforms enough to weaken the applications barrier to entry."). 14 See
   also Elzinga, et al., supra note 4, (manuscript at 42-51) (noting the
   inconsistency between the Plaintiffs' narrow market definition in the
   trial, where the competitive significance of alternative platforms is
   dismissed, and, in the remedies phase, where the porting of an office
   suite is supposed to transform these platforms into strong
   competitors). 10 The District Court had a responsibility, before
   imposing any remedy, to: (1) consider the interests of affected third
   parties and of the public in general; (2) consider whether "other
   measures will not be effective to redress a violation"; and (3) adopt a
   remedy that is no broader than necessary. du Pont de Nemours, 366 U.S.
   at 327-28 (citation omitted); see also Aviation Consumer Action Project
   v. Washburn, 535 F.2d 101, 108 (D.C. Cir. 1976). By uncritically
   entering Plaintiffs' proposed decree, without holding any hearing, and
   (by its own admission) without doing any significant independent
   evaluation of that remedy, the District Court abdicated those
   responsibilities, and imposed a remedy that will cause more harm than
   good. II. The Legal Standards Used by the District Court To Find
   Microsoft Liable Would Chill Competition and Innovation in the IT
   Industry. While breaking up Microsoft would cause immediate injury to
   the IT industry and consumers, the longer lasting and broader negative
   effect of the District Court's decision lies in the new legal rules it
   would impose. The District Court's judgment would chill both
   competition and innovation throughout the industry by (A) making it
   potentially illegal for leading firms to invest in improving products
   or otherwise sacrifice short-term profits to maintain their market-
   leading positions; (B) making it potentially illegal for market-leading
   firms to explore possible collaborations with emerging competitors or
   to compete vigorously for market share in neighboring markets; and (C)
   making it unlawful to add new functions to leading software programs
   where those functions are currently available in stand-alone products.
   In all three respects, the District Court's decision is at odds with
   established antitrust doctrine and is bad policy, as well as bad law.
   A. Treating a Market Leader's Decision To Forgo Short-Term Profits To
   Maintain Its Market Position As Illegal Monopolization Would Outlaw
   Welfare-Enhancing Competitive Behavior. Central to the District Court's
   decision is its holding that Microsoft, through various "predatory"
   acts, unlawfully maintained its lawfully-obtained Windows monopoly. But
   the court 11 defined "predation" as any conduct by a monopolist that
   would not be profit maximizing but for its effect in extending the
   monopoly by "erect[ing] or preserv[ing] barriers against competition .
   . . ." United States v. Microsoft, 87 F. Supp. 2d 30, 38 (D.D.C. 2000)
   [hereinafter "Conclusions of Law"]. By adopting this definition, the
   court condemned procompetitive conduct that is common in the IT
   industry, such as integrating new features into existing programs and
   cross- promotional agreements made to overcome a first-mover's
   advantages. Two things are wrong with what the District Court did.15
   First, it condemns conduct that is not only lawful but desirable. It is
   entirely lawful and desirable for the holder of a lawfully- acquired
   monopoly to compete vigorously to sustain and even extend its monopoly,
   so long as it does so by procompetitive rather than anticompetitive
   means.16 What antitrust law fears from a monopolist is not that it will
   compete vigorously but that it will be able to refrain from competing.
   Similarly, it is desirable, not objectionable, for a firm that enjoys a
   lawful monopoly in one field to compete vigorously in a related field,
   even if its monopoly in the one field gives it a competitive advantage
   in the other.17 Second, a rule requiring lawful monopolists to pull
   their 15 For purposes of this brief, as below, amici accept the
   District Court's finding that Microsoft has a monopoly in a
   hypothetical market for Intel-based PC operating systems. Amici do not
   believe, however, that the record establishes, or that Microsoft in
   fact has, "the power to control prices or exclude competition," United
   States v. E. I. du Pont De Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 391 (1956)
   (citations omitted), which is the proper test for monopoly power. 16
   See, e.g., Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 458 (1993)
   (Antitrust "law directs itself not against conduct which is
   competitive, even severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends
   to destroy competition itself."); Ball Mem'l Hosp. Inc. v. Mutual Hosp.
   Insurance, Inc., 784 F.2d 1325, 1339 (7th Cir. 1986) ("Even the largest
   firms may engage in hard competition, knowing that this will enlarge
   their market shares."). 17 See Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. United
   Airlines, Inc., 948 F.2d 536, 548 (9th Cir. 1991) ("The anticompetitive
   dangers that implicate the Sherman Act are not present when a
   monopolist has a lawful monopoly in one market and uses its power to
   gain a competitive advantage in the second market."); Berkey Photo,
   Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 276 (2d Cir. 1979) ("So long
   as we allow a firm to compete in several fields, we must expect it to
   seek the competitive advantages of its broad-based activity-more
   efficient production, greater ability to develop complementary
   products, reduced transaction costs, and so forth. These are gains that
   accrue to 12 competitive punches would require antitrust courts to
   become the regulators of the software industry, examining the details
   of investment, product design, pricing and promotion decisions by any
   firm that establishes a market-leading position for a particular
   application. Such regulation, if applied to the many temporary
   monopolies that rise and fall in the dynamic IT sector, would strain
   judicial competence and seriously damage consumer welfare. Many firms
   engage in conduct that is not profit maximizing in the short term (for
   example, introductory sales and promotional giveaways) in the interest
   of enhancing their long- term profitability. Such conduct, even when
   undertaken by a monopolist, is lawful so long as the firm is competing
   on the merits. Under well established law, there is nothing wrong with
   a monopolist cutting prices or investing in product improvement out of
   fear that, if it does not, it would lose its monopoly position.18 That
   the monopolist forgoes short-term profits, seeking instead long-term
   profitability by extending its monopoly position, does not make such
   conduct unlawful. A good illustration of the type of lawful conduct
   that would be prohibited under the District Court's formulation is what
   economists call "limit pricing" pricing above cost but below the
   short-term profit-maximizing monopoly price to limit or discourage
   entry or expansion by rivals. The Supreme Court has held that because
   "[l]ow prices benefit consumers regardless of how those prices are
   set," limit pricing "cannot be viewed as . . . anticompetitive" so long
   as the resulting prices are above predatory levels. See Atlantic
   Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., any integrated firm, regardless of
   its market share, and they cannot by themselves be considered uses of
   monopoly power."). 18 See, e.g., United States v. Syufy Enterprises,
   903 F.2d 659, 668-69 (9th Cir. 1990) ("If a dominant supplier acts
   consistent with a competitive market-out of fear perhaps that potential
   competitors are ready and able to step in-the purpose of the antitrust
   laws is amply served."); California Computer Prods., Inc. v. IBM, 613
   F.2d 727, 744 (9th Cir. 1979) (a monopolist has "the right to redesign
   its products to make them more attractive to buyers-whether by reason
   of lower manufacturing cost and price or improved performance."). 13
   495 U.S. 328, 340 (1990). The Court has further held that prices are
   not predatory simply because they are set below a profit-maximizing
   level in order to exclude rivals; to be predatory they must be below an
   appropriate measure of the alleged predator's costs. Brooke Group v.
   Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 222 (1993). As the
   Court explained, "the exclusionary effect of prices above a relevant
   measure of cost either reflects the lower cost structure of the alleged
   predator, and so represents competition on the merits, or is beyond the
   practical ability of a judicial tribunal to control without courting
   intolerable risks of chilling legitimate price-cutting." Id. at 223.19
   In erroneously making short-term profit maximization the test for
   Section 2 liability without even citing these controlling Supreme Court
   precedents, the District Court relied on dicta from this Court's
   earlier decision in Neumann v. Reinforced Earth Co., 786 F.2d 424, 427
   (D.C. Cir. 1986), to the effect that "predation involves aggression
   against business rivals through the use of business practices that
   would not be considered profit maximizing except for the expectation
   that . . . entry of potential rivals [will be] blocked or delayed . . .
   ." But Neumann involved "sham litigation" designed to keep the rival
   from the market, id. at 428, with no possible benefit to consumers.20
   This Court obviously did not mean to bar a lawful monopolist from all
   price cutting or product improvement that may impede rivals, without
   regard to the benefit to consumers. Indeed, Neumann cautioned that a
   monopolist may use "superior efficiency" and "means ... employed in the
   normal course of competition," id. at 427, to compete aggressively,
   even if the result is to drive a rival from the market or to deter
   entry. 19 See also Arthur S. Langenderfer, Inc. v. S. E. Johnson Co.,
   729 F.2d 1050, 1057 (6th Cir. 1984)(rejecting a "profit maximizing
   rule" for assessing predatory pricing as "incompatible with the basic
   principles of antitrust"). 20 See Professional Real Estate Inv., Inc.
   v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 508 U.S. 49, 60-61, 65-66 (1993) (adopting
   an objective standard for sham litigation and rejecting an alternative
   formulation that would have broadened the exception to include any
   litigation whose cost exceeded the profits that would be realized were
   it successful). 14 Aspen Ski Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472
   U.S. 585 (1985), further illustrates that forgoing short-term profits
   is insufficient to prove illegal monopoly maintenance. In Aspen, the
   defendant, by discontinuing a four-mountain ski-lift pass, lowered the
   quality of its own product and thereby reduced demand for that product
   in order to exclude its only competitor. This was not competition on
   the merits, but rather direct "aggression against business rivals."
   Neumann, 786 F.2d at 427. In contrast, Microsoft improved Windows and
   Internet Explorer, making them more attractive to consumers in the
   marketplace, thereby increasing demand for Windows, PCs, and for
   software generally (including Microsoft's own). That conduct,
   therefore, represented competition on the merits and whether that
   conduct was profit maximizing is both irrelevant and beyond the
   competence of the courts to determine.21 In applying the law to the
   case before it, the District Court retreated somewhat from the
   erroneous legal standard it articulated, holding that most of
   Microsoft's conduct in developing and improving Internet Explorer
   ("IE"), selling it at a zero price, and forgoing alternative revenue
   opportunities to promote usage of IE was not predatory, even though it
   may have been unprofitable in the short-term, because Microsoft might
   still have undertaken these efforts "absent the strategic imperative to
   maximize its browser usage share." Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at
   45 (¶ 140). What the lower court overlooked is that, as its own
   findings show, these procompetitive actions, not any restrictive
   practices, were what enabled Microsoft to win the contracts
   (particularly with AOL) that frustrated Netscape's ambition to have
   Navigator become 21 See generally William H. Page & John E. Lopatka,
   The Dubious Search for "Integration" in the Microsoft Trial, 31 CONN.
   L. REV. 1251 (1999) (showing that Microsoft's conduct may have been
   profit maximizing absent any effect on the so-called applications
   barrier to entry). 15 the de facto browser standard.22 Microsoft won
   the early rounds of the ongoing "browser wars" through competition on
   the merits, not through predation. Failing to recognize that these
   findings were fatal to the Plaintiffs' case, the court below proceeded
   to find Microsoft guilty of unlawful monopolization on the basis of
   three allegedly restrictive practices that it concluded crossed the
   line into predation integrating IE into Windows, restricting OEMs from
   removing IE from the Windows desktop, and entering into restrictive
   cross-promotion arrangements with Internet Access Providers ("IAPs").
   Conclusions of Law, 87 F. Supp. 2d at 50-53. In each case, however, the
   conduct the District Court condemned is both common in the IT industry
   and procompetitive. Integration. As discussed in Part II.C below,
   integrating new functions into existing software is a common form of
   competition in the IT industry. As this Court has already found, adding
   web browsing functionality to Windows offers facially plausible
   benefits to consumers.23 It could not, therefore, be found to violate
   Section 1 without a showing of injury to competition, and there was no
   such showing. See pp. 23-24 infra. It follows a fortiori that the
   conduct cannot have violated Section 2, because "[c]oncerted activity
   subject to § 1 is judged more sternly than unilateral conduct under §
   2." Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 768
   (1984). OEM Restrictions. The provisions in Microsoft's license
   agreements with OEMs that state that OEMs cannot alter Windows without
   Microsoft's permission are likewise common in 22 See, e.g., Findings of
   Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 77 & 85 (¶¶ 272 & 304) (finding that
   Microsoft's "coup" in winning the AOL contract gave Internet Explorer a
   significant share of the market and "contributed to extinguishing the
   threat that Navigator posed to the applications barrier to entry"); id.
   79-83 (¶¶ 281-98) (describing how Microsoft won the AOL contract
   because of the attractiveness of its componentized design, which
   Netscape could not match, and the significant engineering assistance,
   technical support, precise delivery dates and promotional assistance
   Microsoft offered). 23 See, e.g., United States v. Microsoft Corp., 147
   F.3d 935, 550 (D.C. Cir. 1998) [hereinafter "Microsoft II"]. 16 the IT
   industry and served the legitimate business purpose of protecting
   Microsoft's copyrighted Windows desktop design. Software developers
   need to be able to protect their designs in order to realize the value
   of their copyrighted inventions. This being the case, for those
   provisions to be unlawful, there would need to be a finding, at a
   minimum, that they injured competition.24 The district court made no
   such finding. To the contrary, it found that including Internet
   Explorer did not "prevent OEMs from meeting demand for Navigator, which
   remained higher than demand for Internet Explorer well into 1998."
   Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 102 (¶ 376). Cross-Marketing
   Arrangements. The types of discounts, promotional consideration,
   rebates, and cross-marketing arrangements the court found potentially
   exclusionary in the IAP channel are also common in the IT industry.
   They represent vigorous competition on the merits, serving the
   legitimate purposes of facilitating entry into new markets and
   preventing IAPs from misappropriating the free advertising provided by
   placement on the Windows desktop. The provisions in Microsoft's
   cross-marketing agreements were actually shorter-term and less
   restrictive than many in the industry. Most significantly, the District
   Court found, in rejecting the Plaintiffs' exclusive dealing claim, that
   these restrictions did not foreclose Netscape from the market.
   Conclusions of Law, 87 F. Supp. 2d at 53. As with the tying claim, this
   should have ended the matter with respect to Section 2. In finding
   these commonplace and procompetitive IT industry practices unlawful,
   even in the absence of any finding of foreclosure or consumer injury,
   the court below relied heavily on internal e-mails and statements as
   evidence of predatory intent. See, e.g., Findings of Fact, 84 F. 24 See
   California Dental Ass'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756 (1999)(holding that so
   long as the defendant offers a "plausible" procompetitive explanation
   for an alleged restraint, the plaintiff must prove that the restraint
   harms competition before the burden shifts to the defendant to show
   that it is reasonably necessary to achieve the claimed benefits). 17
   Supp. 2d at 49, 50, 51-52 (¶¶ 155, 160, 166-68). But, as Judge Posner
   has noted, courts widely accept the "antitrust commonplace . . . that
   if conduct is not objectively anticompetitive the fact that it was
   motivated by hostility to competitors . . . is irrelevant." Olympia
   Equip. Leasing Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co., 797 F.2d 370, 379 (7th
   Cir. 1986).25 Such intent evidence is more likely to mislead than to
   illuminate, thereby creating unacceptable risks for businessmen. As
   Areeda and Hovenkamp explain, "[A]n antitrust rule permitting jurors to
   sift through records pertaining to the firm's intent cannot help but
   chill perfectly appropriate behavior that the antitrust laws are
   intended to encourage."26 B. The Court's Findings on Attempted
   Monopolization Would Chill Potentially Procompetitive Collaborations
   and Aggressive Competition for Market Share. The District Court's
   conclusion that Microsoft's conduct amounted to attempted
   monopolization of the so-called Internet browser market also threatens
   to chill innovation and competition in the IT industry. The court's
   decision would substantially broaden the offense of attempted
   monopolization in two significant respects. First, it would make it
   virtually per se unlawful for successful firms to explore collaborative
   relationships with emerging competitors. Second, it would permit a
   "dangerous probability of success" to be proven simply by showing that
   a firm has secured a 50-60 percent market share without requiring any
   showing that the firm will ever be in a position to exercise market
   power that is, the power to raise price and exclude competitors. Both
   propositions are wrong as a matter of law and would have serious
   adverse repercussions for the IT industry. 25 See generally III PHILLIP
   E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 651a, at 74 (1996) ("the
   nature and consequences of a particular practice are the vital
   consideration, not the purpose or intent[, ... a]nd are almost always
   established by objective facts."). 26 IIIA PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT
   HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 755c, at 233. See, e.g., Fishman v. Estate
   of Wirtz, 807 F.2d 520, 543 (7th Cir. 1986) ("Hostility to a rival is
   not a sure sign of anticompetitiveness because `[v]igorous competitors
   intend to harm rivals, to do all the business if they can. To penalize
   this intent is to penalize competition.'") (quoting Ball Mem'l Hosp.
   Inc. v. Mutual Hosp. Ins., Inc., 784 F.2d 1325, 1339 (7th Cir. 1986)).
   18 1. The District Court's Treatment of Competitor Collaborations The
   lower court's first basis for finding attempted monopolization was that
   Microsoft allegedly proposed a market allocation arrangement to
   Netscape in June 1995. In so ruling, the court relied solely on United
   States v. American Airlines, Inc., 743 F.2d 1114, 1116 (5th Cir. 1984),
   in which the court found American Airlines liable for attempted
   monopolization by virtue of its CEO Robert Crandall's infamous taped
   conversation with his counterpart at Braniff: "Raise your goddamn fares
   20 percent. I'll raise mine the next morning." See Conclusions of Law,
   87 F. Supp. 2d at 45-46. The District Court's reliance on American
   Airlines is misplaced. Unlike Crandall, who proposed a naked price
   fixing agreement that would have been per se illegal, Microsoft was
   doing something IT firms do every day: exploring a possible
   collaboration that on its face had the potential to promote competition
   by bringing together the complementary strengths of two firms to
   develop software more efficiently.27 As this Court ruled in Rothery
   Storage & Van Company v. Atlas Van Lines, 792 F.2d 210, 228-30 (D.C.
   Cir 1986)(Bork, J.), competitor collaborations of the type Microsoft
   claims it sought to explore with Netscape are often procompetitive and,
   if consummated, must generally be evaluated under the rule of reason to
   determine whether their procompetitive benefits outweigh any potential
   loss of competition from the elimination of rivalry between the two
   firms.28 Whether or not the collaboration Microsoft 27 See generally
   THOMAS M. JORDE & DAVID J. TEECE, ANTITRUST, INNOVATION, AND
   COMPETITIVENESS 16 (1992) (The requirements of the innovation process
   increasingly "are such that no single firm has the capacity to conduct
   all of the activity alone, for reasons of cost, competence and
   timeliness."); ADAM M. BRANDENBURGER & BARRY J. NALEBUFF, CO- OPETITION
   4 (1996) (In network markets, "[y]ou have to compete and cooperate at
   the same time."); CARL SHAPIRO & HAL R. VARIAN, INFORMATION RULES: A
   STRATEGIC GUIDE TO THE INFORMATION ECONOMY 258 (1999) ("To compete
   effectively in network markets you need allies."). 28 See also, Addamax

   shams, . . . are rarely susceptible to per se treatment.") (citation
   omitted); Northrop Corp. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 705 F.2d 19
   proposed exploring would have been lawful under the antitrust laws had
   it proceeded is beside the point. If the mere act of exploring such
   collaboration without even reaching an agreement exposes a firm to a
   finding that it is attempting to allocate markets and thereby
   monopolize them, the entire IT industry will feel the chill. 2. The
   District Court's Reliance on Microsoft's Growing Market Share The lower
   court's second basis for finding attempted monopolization was
   Microsoft's 50 percent and growing share of web browsing usage, which
   the court held showed a dangerous probability that Microsoft would
   succeed in gaining a monopoly in the alleged Internet browser market.
   See Conclusions of Law, 87 F. Supp. 2d at 46. Under this theory, almost
   every successful software firm would at some point in its life have a
   dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power. It is common for a
   software firm that designs a better product to capture 50 percent or
   more of the users of a particular software application for some period
   of time. Netscape itself did just that when it first introduced
   Navigator. Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 101-02 (¶ 372). But as
   Microsoft's success in displacing Netscape shows, these markets can
   shift back and forth with remarkable speed. One of the most forceful
   descriptions of this phenomenon comes from Dr. Franklin Fisher, the
   Plaintiffs' principal economic expert in this case. He explains that in
   rapidly changing markets characterized by technical innovation, market
   shares do not accurately predict a company's possession or lack of
   monopoly power: An obvious but important lesson from [the] analysis of
   the process of competition in a market with rapid technological change
   is that in assessing whether a firm in such a market has monopoly
   power, one must be sure to observe the process of innovative
   competition at work. A snapshot taken at a single moment in time can be
   1030, 1050-54 (9th Cir. 1983) ("teaming arrangement" by which one joint
   venturer would be prime contractor for land-based aircraft and the
   other would be prime contractor for carrier-based aircraft should be
   judged under the rule of reason). 20 entirely misleading. It might, for
   example, show one firm (the innovator) well ahead of its rivals and
   with a substantial share of even a reasonably well-defined market. But
   since the snapshot could not reveal either the competitive process
   whereby the firm attained its position or the competitive response of
   rival firms, it could not form a reliable basis for making inferences
   about the presence or absence of monopoly power. Franklin M. Fisher, et
   al, Folded, Spindled, and Mutilated: Economic Analysis of U.S. v.
   I.B.M., 38 (1983).29 To find a dangerous probability of monopoly, a
   court must find that the defendant is poised to capture a dominant
   position durable enough to give it market power that is, the ability to
   raise prices above a competitive level or to restrict output over an
   extended period of time. NCAA v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 109
   n.38 (1984) (citations omitted). That is plainly not the case here and
   is historically not the case in the IT industry. Today over one third
   of Internet Explorer's usage derives from a single contract with
   Netscape's own parent, AOL. See Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 85
   (¶ 303). That contract expires in just a few months. Id. at 84 (¶ 301).
   Microsoft cannot possibly hope to keep that contract, and its current
   market share, unless it can persuade Netscape's parent that Microsoft
   continues to offer the best product at the best price. In addition,
   Netscape Navigator continues to be widely distributed by many of the
   leading OEMs and ISPs. Indeed, while Microsoft was allegedly seeking to
   exclude Netscape from the market, Netscape's installed base more than
   doubled growing from 15 million to 33 million users in the United
   States alone. Id. at 103 (¶ 378). Faced with this kind of growth by its
   principal rival, Microsoft hardly seems poised to gain a durable
   monopoly over the browser market. 29 See also IIIA PHILLIP E. AREEDA &
   HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 807e2, at 359- 60 (1996) ("[I]f the
   defendant can experience rapid growth in market share, others can as
   well. Market shares that go from 0 to 60 percent in two years . . .
   suggest an unstable market in which it is unlikely that any firm could
   maintain a monopoly output reduction for very long."). 21 C. Treating
   the Addition of New Functions to Existing Software as Per Se Illegal
   Tying Would Outlaw Welfare-Enhancing Innovations. The District Court's
   decision to treat Microsoft's integration of web browsing functionality
   into Windows without also offering a non-integrated version as a per se
   illegal tie is similarly wrong as a matter of law and would damage
   technological innovation if adopted as a new antitrust policy. Adding
   new functions to existing software is a nearly universal form of
   innovation in the software industry and is essential in persuading
   customers to upgrade from their existing software to a new, improved
   version. For example, word processing programs have incorporated
   formerly separate spell-checkers and outliners, personal finance
   programs have incorporated tax functions, the AOL proprietary client
   software has incorporated instant messaging, Oracle is integrating its
   database with its applications server, and email programs have
   incorporated contact managers. If companies that gain a "dominant"
   position in a given field were barred from innovating in this manner,
   consumers would be denied new benefits that result from integration,
   and the software industry would stagnate. This Court has already
   considered this issue at length in reversing the District Court's
   preliminary injunction against Microsoft under the 1995 consent decree.
   Microsoft II, 147 F.3d at 948-951. That opinion explained that courts
   should not be "in the unwelcome position of designing computers," id.
   at 950 (quoting IX Phillip E. Areeda, Antitrust Law ¶ 1700j, at 15),
   and should not "embark on product design assessment." Microsoft II, 147
   F.3d at 949. Noting that the issue is not whether "an integrated
   product is superior to its stand-alone rivals," the Court ruled that
   Microsoft "ha[d] clearly met the burden of ascribing facially plausible
   benefits 22 to its integrated design as compared to an operating system
   combined with a stand-alone browser such as Netscape's Navigator." Id.
   at 950.30 The District Court refused to follow this Court's ruling in
   Microsoft II, not because it found that there were no "facially
   plausible" benefits from adding web browsing functionality to Windows,
   but because it concluded that this Court's approach which it dismissed
   as dictum was inconsistent with the Supreme Court's decision in
   Jefferson Parrish v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2 (1984). See Conclusions of Law,
   87 F. Supp. 2d at 47-48. In so ruling, the District Court overlooks one
   of the most important advances in modern antitrust doctrine. Ever since
   its decision in Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, 441 U.S. 1 (1979), the
   Supreme Court has cautioned that the courts should not apply simplistic
   labels, such as price fixing or tying, to declare conduct per se
   illegal in new contexts where the label may not fit. Warning that
   "[l]iteralness is overly simplistic and often overbroad," the Court
   held in BMI that before characterizing conduct as per se unlawful, a
   court should examine "whether the practice facially appears to be one
   that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and
   decrease output . . . , or instead one designed to `increase economic
   efficiency and render markets more, rather than less, competitive." Id.
   at 9, 19, 20 (citations omitted). Only if the conduct is a "naked
   restrain[t] of trade with no purpose except stifling of competition"
   can it be characterized as per se unlawful. Id. at 2 (quoting White
   Motor Co v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 263 (1963)).31 30 See also
   Microsoft II, 147 F.3d at 950 ("Professor Areeda argues that new
   products integrating functionalities in a useful way should be
   considered single products regardless of market structure.") (citing X
   PHILLIP E. AREEDA et al., ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 1746b at 225-26 (1996)). 31
   See also California Dental Ass'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756 (1999)(holding
   that so long as the defendant offers a "plausible" procompetitive
   explanation for an alleged restraint, the plaintiff must prove that the
   restraint harms competition before the burden shifts to the defendant
   to show that it is reasonably necessary to achieve the claimed
   benefits). 23 This Court's decision in Microsoft II comports with this
   Supreme Court jurisprudence. It also comports with previous lower court
   decisions refusing to label the introduction of integrated products as
   per se illegal ties.32 Nothing in Jefferson Parrish or Eastman Kodak v.
   Image Technology Services, 504 U.S. 451 (1992), requires a contrary
   result. Both cases rely on the assumption that the alleged tying
   anesthesia services to surgery in Jefferson Parish and copier repair
   services to copier parts in Image Technical Services was
   anticompetitive because consumers were forced to purchase products from
   the defendants that they would prefer to get from others. Adding
   functionality to an existing software program could not be more
   different from these types of contractual ties. Adding functionality,
   on its face, enhances a software's capabilities. And, unlike the
   surgical patient in Jefferson Parish who could be anesthetized only by
   a specific anesthesiologist or the copy machine owner in Image
   Technical Services who could use only specific repair companies, a
   purchaser of integrated software remains free to continue using
   stand-alone products, such as Navigator.33 Since, as this Court has
   already found, integrating web browsing functionality into Windows
   provided "facially plausible" benefits to consumers,34 the District
   Court could not, under the controlling Supreme Court case law, find an
   illegal tie without engaging in a full rule of reason analysis. This it
   failed to do. Had it done so, the court would have found as it did with
   respect to exclusive dealing that Microsoft's conduct could not have
   violated Section 1 32 See, e.g., ILC Peripherals Leasing Corp. v. IBM,
   448 F. Supp. 228, 233 (N.D. Cal. 1978); Innovation Data Processing,
   Inc. v. IBM, 585 F. Supp. 1470, 1476 (D.N.J. 1984); Foremost Pro Color
   v. Eastman Kodak Co., 703 F.2d 534, 542-43 (9th Cir. 1983). See
   generally William H. Page & John E. Lopatka, The Dubious Search for
   "Integration" in the Microsoft Trial, 31 CONN. L. REV. 1251, 1273
   (1999) . 33 See Page & Lopatka, supra note 33, at 1273. 34 See
   Microsoft II, 147 F.3d at 950. 24 because it did not foreclose Netscape
   from any channel of distribution, much less from the market as a
   whole.35 CONCLUSION "Consequences cannot alter statutes, but may help
   to fix their meaning." In re Rouss, 116 N.E. 782, 785 (N.Y. 1917)
   (Cardozo, J.). The antitrust laws were not intended to bring a booming,
   highly-competitive industry to a standstill. But the District Court's
   ruling is likely to do just that. There is no objective evidence that
   the business practices at issue in this case caused injury to
   competition or consumers. The District Court's ruling will stifle
   growth, innovation, and competition in the technology industry; the
   remedy imposed will harm consumers and throw the industry into
   confusion about the new rules restricting competition. The District
   Court's judgment should be reversed. Respectfully submitted, Thaler
