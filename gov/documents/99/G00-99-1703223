   About This Site


   This is the fifth major redesign of Senator Kennedy's website. During
   this design process we collected comments submitted to the
   webmaster@kennedy.senate.gov e-mail address. We also performed several
   major audits of the official websites on the hill and established a
   best practices document which we referred to throughout the design
   process. The design concept behind this fifth version of the web page
   began with the concept of a web portal. What is a portal? A portal is
   simply a web site that offers a doorway into a world of information
   ABOUT a specific thing.. It can just as easily, (in fact more easily),
   be a doorway into a specific topic that you are interested in. A portal
   is a system of integrated programs designed to make it easier for a
   user to find information. The purpose of all of this integrated
   information is to provide convenience, and a sense of community to the
   user, and to help make the user feel more comfortable about using the
   portal for the purpose of beginning their journey from "there" as
   opposed to trying to go out all over the internet and find all the
   pieces of the puzzles for themselves. So in this sense this portal is
   being offered to out constituents as a valuable timesaving service.
   Each page offers constituents a mix of streaming content, links, and
   original content produced by the office and by the Senate community. We
   will be actively encouraging your feedback and updating features on the
   site to make this the best web experience possible.

   CREDITS:
   This page was designed by the office of Senator Edward M Kennedy in
   cooperation with CaseyDorin Internet Productions. If you experience any
   functional problems with the website or if you have any suggestions
   with how we can make your visit to our page better, please contact the
   webmaster.
