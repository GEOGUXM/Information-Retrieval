     Undersea research is oceanography done by scientists who enter the
     oceans using scuba, robots and submarines. National Undersea
     Research Program (NURP) researchers explore, sample and live beneath
     the sea. They study a range of environmental problems and science,
     from beach erosion to deep sea volcanoes.

     NURP is part of the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration's
     (NOAA) research line office, the Office of NOAA Research.
