      Funding Guide

   Moving Costs: A Transportation Funding Guide for the San Francisco Bay Area

                                 View HTML version

      This compact but information-rich guide -- published by MTC in January
      1999, and revised in Spring 2000 -- explains the various ways an
      interested citizen (and agency staffers) can influence funding
      decisions. The core of the book consists of detailed tables summarizing
      over 50 federal, state and local sources of money, indicating the
      amount available, eligible uses, who may claim it and who determines
      which projects benefit. The guide also includes a glossary that decodes
      jargon, acronyms and other forms of transportation "financese."
      Equipped with this guide, the funding explorer can set out with
      confidence.
