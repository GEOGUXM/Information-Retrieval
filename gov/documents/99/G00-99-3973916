   The Department of Justice continually provides informal guidance to
   prosecutors and investigators as they work through complex substantive,
   procedural and practical elements of computer crime cases. While this
   guidance does not provide any legal rights or obligations, it is
   helpful to law enforcement as they address challenging questions of
   law, policy or practice. Additional information on this subject is
   available below.

   A. Guidance on New Authorities that Relate to Computer Crime and
   Electronic Evidence Enacted in the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (October
   2001)

   On October 26, 2001, the United States of America Patriot Act of 2001
   was enacted into law. Within the Act, several laws relating to computer
   crime and electronic evidence have been amended.

   Specific information on these changes is available via the link below.

   B. Tracking a Computer Hacker, Daniel A. Morris, USA Bulletin (May
   2001)

   A report written near the start of the Information Age warned that
   America's computers were at risk from hackers. It said that computers
   that"control [our] power delivery, communications, aviation and
   financial services [and] store vital information, from medical records
   to business plans, to criminal records," were vulnerable from many
   sources, including deliberate attack. "The modern thief can steal more
   with a computer than with a gun. Tomorrow's terrorist may be able to do
   more damage with a keyboard than with a bomb." National Research
   Council, "Computers at Risk," 1991.

     C. Its Not Just Fun and "War Games"  Juveniles and Computer Crime,
     Joseph V. DeMarco, USA Bulletin (May 2001)

     In the 1983 movie "War Games," Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy
     play high school students who inadvertently access the NORAD
     computer network, thinking that they are merely playing a "war game"
     with the computers. As a consequence, Broderick and Sheedy come
     Hollywood-close to initiating a nuclear exchange between the United
     States and the Soviet Union. In order to
     accomplish this hack, Broderick configures his PC's modem to
     automatically dial random telephone numbers in the city where the
     computers he hopes to break into are located. When Sheedy asks
     Broderick how he pays for all the telephone calls, Broderick coyly
     tells her that "there are ways around" paying for the phone service.
     Sheedy asks: "Isn't that a crime"? Broderick's reply: "Not if you
     are under eighteen."

   D. Working with Victims of Computer Network Hacks, Richard P. Salgado,
   USA Bulletin(March 2001)

   In our ten years experience in detecting, locating, and prosecuting
   network intruders (hackers) we have seen that, as with many offline
   crimes, robust law enforcement alone cannot solve the network intruder
   problem. To be effective, any overall strategy must include the owners
   and operators of the nations computer networks. They are the first
   line of defense and have the responsibility to take reasonable measures
   to ensure that their systems are secure. They are also in the best
   position to detect intrusions and take the first critical steps to
   respond. At the most basic level, we rely on network operators to
   report to us when their systems are hacked. Intrusion victims, however,
   are often even more reluctant to call law enforcement than other
   business victims. This reluctance has been reflected in the surveys
   conducted jointly by the Computer Security Institute and the FBI. In
   the year 2000 survey, for example, only 25% of the respondents who
   experienced computer intrusions reported the incidents to law
   enforcement. To better understand why and to learn how we can promote
   reporting, the Department of Justice has undertaken a concerted effort
   to reach out to the operators of our nations computer networks.

   E. Supervised Release and Probation Restrictions in Hacker Cases,
   Christopher M.E. Painter, (March 2001)

   An often overlooked aspect of sentencing in computer crime cases are
   conditions that the court can impose as part of a sentence of probation
   or supervised release. These conditions can be tailored to restrict,
   among other things, a defendants employment, associations, and other
   activities, once he is released from any term of imprisonment the court
   imposes to protect the public and aid in a defendants rehabilitation.
   Such conditions are routinely imposed in non-computer crime cases. For
   example, in bank fraud cases or insurance fraud cases, courts often
   impose conditions restricting a defendants employment in those
   industries. In investment fraud cases, defendants are prohibited from
   handling other peoples money and in telemarketing cases, courts have
   prohibited defendants from soliciting investors, using names other than
   their own and have even restricted their access to telephones.
