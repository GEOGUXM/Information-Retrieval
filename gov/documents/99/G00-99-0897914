     The NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) offers neutron
     scattering and chemical analysis instruments to all qualified users.

     ******
     The next deadline for receipt of NEW proposals is September 24,
     2001.
     Note that this date is 6 days later than the previously announced
     deadline.
     The deadline for continuation proposals is October 16, 2001.
     Continuation proposals must be accompanied by an experimental
     report, and are critically reviewed by the Program Advisory
     Committee. A continuation proposal should be submitted only to
     complete work clearly laid out in the original proposal. Extensions
     of prior work to new systems or in new directions should be
     requested through a new proposal.

     Proposals that are favorably reviewed by external referees and
     recommended by the Program Advisory Committee will be scheduled for
     experiments from January 2002 through July 2002.

NEW for this proposal round:

     PROGRAM PROPOSALS
     The applicant may request beam time to be used over a two-year
     period. Time may be requested on one or two instruments. The total
     time allocated to Program Proposals may not exceed 25% of the user
     time available on any instrument. A higher standard will apply to
     Program Proposals than to regular regular proposals.

     Detailed Instructions

     QUICK ACCESS PROPOSALS
     If a user feels that beam time is required very soon to carry out
     important measurements that cannot be delayed, a proposal may be
     submitted requesting expedited access. The regular Web proposal form
     should be used, and NCNR personnel must be notified. The proposal
     will be reviewed by the PAC, and held to a substantially higher
     standard than regular proposals.

     Detailed Instructions

     DECREASED PROPOSAL LENGTH LIMIT
     The length limit of the text for experiment description in regular
     proposals has been shortened to 800 words, or approximately two
     double-spaced typed pages. Text in excess of this limit will be
     omitted.

     MORE USER BEAM TIME ON HIGH RESOLUTION SPECTROMETERS
     The fraction of time reserved for users on the Disk Chopper
     Spectrometer (DCS) will be increased to 2/3 from the present 1/3.
     The Fermi Chopper Spectrometer (FCS) will no longer be offered to
     users, because of the superior capabilities of the DCS. The user
     time fraction on the High Flux Backscattering Spectrometer (HFBS)
     and the Neutron Spin Echo (NSE) Spectrometer will also be increased
     to 2/3.

     EXPANSION OF CHRNS
     The Center for High Resolution Neutron Scattering (CHRNS), funded by
     the National Science Foundation (NSF), previously included the 30-m
     NG-3 SANS instrument, the USANS instrument on BT5, and the SPINS
     triple-axis spectrometer. It has recently been expanded to include
     the three new high resolution inelastic instruments in the guide
     hall (see previous paragraph).

     ****

     In the current call for proposals, the following instruments are
     offered to applicants.
     Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) - 30 m (NG3)
     Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) - 30 m (NG7)
     Ultra-Small Angle Neutron Scattering (USANS) instrument
     Reflectometer - horizontal geometry
     Reflectometer - vertical geometry
     Cold Neutron Triple-Axis with Polarized Beam Option (SPINS)
     Backscattering Spectrometer
     Disk-Chopper Spectrometer
     Neutron Spin-Echo Spectrometer
     Filter-Analyzer Neutron Spectrometer

     Proposals for the following instruments may be submitted at any
     time:
     High resolution powder diffractometer
     Cold Neutron Depth Profiling Station
     Prompt-Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis Station

     If accepted, proposals for the latter three instruments usually
     receive instrument time in the subsequent facility cycle (i.e., in
     1-3 months).

     To apply for beam time, please use the WEB PAGE PROPOSAL FORM. This
     is our preferred format, since it allows efficient processing of
     your proposal. Other formats (word, Wordperfect) are available.

     If you would like more detailed information about the NCNR
     instruments than is given on these pages, please contact the
     appropriate instrument scientist. For more general information about
     the NCNR, call W. A. Kamitakahara at (301) 975-6878. You may inquire
     by mail to the address below, by electronic mail to
     wkamitakahara@nist.gov, or FAX a message to (301) 921-9847.
