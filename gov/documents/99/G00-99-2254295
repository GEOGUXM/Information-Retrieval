   All of our judges are very seasoned and, with many new and young
   lawyers finding their way into our courts, the Forum believes it is
   appropriate to present an overview of practice pointers. Experienced
   lawyers will also benefit. The program will include:

     * Tried and true techniques that work
     * Court room conduct
     * Nuances of pretrial orders, discovery motions, Etc.
     * Conduct of the trial, objections to evidence, Etc.

     * Important provisions of the FRCP and FRE
     * Common pitfalls as viewed from both the Bench and Bar.
     * Implementation of recent revisions to the FRCP in the District.
     * Judicial attitudes towards particular types of claims for relief
