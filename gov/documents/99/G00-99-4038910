   AGENCY: Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA.
   ACTION: Notice.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SUMMARY: Commodity Credit Corporation is inviting proposals for the
   Fiscal Year 2002 Market Access Program.
   DATES: All applications must be received by 5 p.m. Eastern Standard
   Time, March 11, 2002.
   FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marketing Operations Staff, Foreign
   Agricultural Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 4932-S, STOP
   1042, 1400 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20250, (202)
   720-4327.
   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
   Introduction
       The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) announces that applications
   are being accepted for participation in the Fiscal Year 2002 Market
   Access Program (MAP). The MAP is designed to create, expand and
   maintain foreign markets for United States' agricultural commodities
   and products through cost-share assistance. Financial assistance under
   the MAP will be made available on a competitive basis and applications
   will be reviewed against the evaluation criteria contained herein. The
   MAP is administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS).
       Under the MAP, CCC enters into agreements with eligible
   participants to share the costs of certain overseas marketing and
   promotion activities. MAP participants may receive assistance for
   either generic or brand promotion activities. The program generally
   operates on a reimbursement basis.
   Authority
       The MAP is authorized under section 203 of the Agricultural Trade
   Act of 1978, as amended. MAP regulations appear at 7 CFR part 1485.
   Eligible Applicants
       To participate in the MAP an applicant must be: a nonprofit U.S.
   agricultural trade organization, a nonprofit state regional trade group
   (i.e., an association of State Departments of Agriculture), a U.S.
   agricultural cooperative, a State agency, or a small-sized U.S.
   commercial entity (other than a cooperative or producer association).
   Available Funds
       $90 million of cost-share assistance may be obligated under this
   announcement to eligible MAP applicants.
   Application Process
       To be considered for the MAP an applicant must submit to the FAS
   information required by the MAP regulations set forth in 7 CFR part
   1485. Incomplete applications and applications which do not otherwise
   conform to this announcement will not be accepted for review.
       The FAS administers various other agricultural export assistance
   programs including the Foreign Market Development Cooperator
   (Cooperator) program, Cochran Fellowships, the Emerging Markets
   Program, the Quality Samples Program, the Section 108 foreign currency
   program, and several Export Credit Guarantee programs. Organizations
   which are interested in applying for MAP funds are encouraged to submit
   their requests using the Unified Export Strategy (UES) format. The UES
   allows interested entities to submit a consolidated and strategically
   coordinated single proposal that incorporates requests for funding and
   recommendations for virtually all the FAS marketing programs, financial
   assistance programs, and market access programs. The suggested UES
   format encourages applicants to examine the constraints or barriers to
   trade which they face, identify activities which would help overcome
   such impediments, consider the entire pool of complementary marketing
   tools and program resources, and establish realistic export goals.
   Applicants are not required, however, to use the UES format.
       Organizations can submit applications in the UES format by two
   methods. The first allows an applicant to submit information directly
   to the FAS through the UES application Internet site. The FAS highly
   recommends applying via the Internet, as this format virtually
   eliminates paperwork and expedites the FAS processing and review cycle.
   Applicants also have the option of submitting electronic versions
   (along with two paper copies) of their applications to the FAS on
   diskette.
       Applicants planning to use the Internet-based system must contact
   the FAS Marketing Operations Staff on (202) 720-4327 to obtain site
   access information. The Internet-based application, including
   step-by-step instructions for its use, is located at the following URL
   address:
   http://www.fas.usda.gov/cooperators.html.
       Applicants who choose to submit applications on diskette can
   download the UES handbook, including the suggested application format
   and instructions, from the following URL address: http://
   www.fas.usda.gov/mos/ues/unified.html. A UES handbook also may be
   obtained by contacting the Marketing Operations Staff on (202)
   720-4327.
       All MAP applicants, whether applying via the Internet or diskette,
   also must submit by March 11, 2002, via hand delivery or U.S. mail, an
   original signed certification statement as specified in 7 CFR
   1485.13(a)(2)(i)(G). The UES handbook contains an acceptable
   certification format.
       Any organization which is not interested in applying for the MAP
   but would like to request assistance through one of the other programs
   mentioned should contact the Marketing Operations Staff on (202)
   720-4327.
   Review Process and Allocation Criteria
       The FAS allocates funds in a manner which effectively supports the
   strategic decision-making initiatives of the Government Performance and
   Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 and the USDA's Food and Agricultural Policy
   (FAP). In deciding whether a proposed project will contribute to the
   effective creation, expansion, or maintenance of foreign markets, the
   FAS seeks to identify a clear, long-term agricultural trade strategy
   and a program effectiveness time line against which results can be
   measured at specific intervals using quantifiable product or country
   goals. The FAS also considers the extent to which a proposed project
   targets markets with the greatest growth potential. These factors are
   part of the FAS resource allocation strategy to fund applicants who can
   demonstrate performance and address the objectives of the GPRA and FAP.
       Following is a description of the FAS process for reviewing
   applications and the criteria for allocating available MAP funds.
   (1) Phase 1--Sufficiency Review and FAS Divisional Review
       Applications received by the closing date will be reviewed by the
   FAS to determine the eligibility of the applicants and the completeness
   of the applications. These requirements appear at Sec. 1485.12 and Sec.
   1485.13 of the MAP regulations. Applications which meet the
   requirements then will be further evaluated by the proper FAS Commodity
   Division. The Divisions will review each application against the
   criteria listed in Sec. 1485.14 of the MAP regulations. The purpose of
   this review is to identify meritorious proposals and to recommend an
   appropriate funding level for each application based upon these
   criteria.
   (2) Phase 2--Competitive Review
       Meritorious applications then will be passed on to the Office of
   the Deputy Administrator, Commodity and Marketing Programs, for the
   purpose of allocating available funds among the applicants.
   Applications which pass the Divisional Review will compete for funds on
   the basis of the following allocation criteria (the number in
   parentheses represents a percentage weight factor):
   (a) Applicant's Contribution Level (40)
       The applicant's 4-year average share (1999-2002) of all
   contributions (cash and goods and services provided by U.S. entities in
   support of overseas marketing and promotion activities) compared to
       The applicant's 4-year average share (1999-2002) of the funding
   level for all MAP participants.
   (b) Past Performance (30)
       The 3-year average share (1999-2001) of the value of exports
   promoted by the applicant compared to
       The applicant's 2-year average share (2000-2001) of the funding
   level for all MAP applicants plus, for those groups participating in
   the Cooperator program, the 2-year average share (2001-2002) of
   Cooperator marketing plan budgets, and the 2-year average share
   (2000-2001) of foreign overhead provided for co-location within a U.S.
   agricultural office;
   (c) Projected Export Goals (15)
       The total dollar value of projected exports promoted by the
   applicant for 2002 compared to
       The applicant's requested funding level;
   (d) Accuracy of Past Projections (15)
       Actual exports for 2000 as reported in the 2002 MAP application
   compared to
       Past projections of exports for 2000 as specified in the 2000 MAP
   application.
       The Commodity Divisions' recommended funding level for each
   applicant is converted to a percentage of the total MAP funds available
   then multiplied by the total weight factor as described above to
   determine the amount of funds allocated to each applicant.
   Closing Date for Applications
       All Internet-based applications must be properly submitted by 5
   p.m. Eastern Standard Time, March 11, 2002. Signed certification
   statements also must be received by that time at one of the addresses
   listed below.
       All applications on diskette (with two accompanying paper copies
   and a signed certification statement) and any other applications must
   be received by 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, March 11, 2002, at one of
   the following addresses:
