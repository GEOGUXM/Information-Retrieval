     * The MM5 was developed at Penn State and NCAR as a community
       mesoscale model and is in the public domain.
     * This model is being run within the NWSFO Buffalo forecast office as
       part of a COMET Cooperative project with SUNY Oswego, SUNY
       Brockport Cornell University  and WSFO Binghamton.
     * The model runs on a Linux workstation using a 400 MHz Pentium
       (single processor) PC with 256 MB of memory.
     * Our implementation uses a 60 km outer grid and a 20 km inner grid.
     * Generating hourly output through 24 hours takes about 90 minutes.
