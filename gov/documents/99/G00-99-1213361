     This section of the Aura site describes the various phases and
     activities of the mission. The Aura Project is responsible for the
     construction of the satellite and its launch and operations for 90 days
     after orbit insertion. After this time, the satellite becomes
     operational and its control and data acquisition becomes the
     responsibility of the GSFC Flight Operations Team while the GSFC EOS
     Data and Operations System is responsible for data acquisition and
     initial data processing. Science data products are produced by each
     instrument principal investigator. The entire post launch activity is
     managed and coordinated by the Aura Project Science Office in
     conjunction with the principal investigators.
