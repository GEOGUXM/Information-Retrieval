Locate information on how to service onboard diagnostic (OBD) systems and to
perform other emission-related diagnosis and repair

   The EPA determined that one of the best ways to bring the air quality
   levels of the nation's cities into compliance with the National Ambient
   Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and carbon monoxide was to
   address automobile emission levels. When you consider that a large
   portion of automobile repairs are performed by independent providers,
   it is important to ensure that aftermarket automotive technicians have
   access to the proper information on the operation and repair of
   emission and related systems.

   Use our web site to locate information on how to service onboard
   diagnostic (OBD) systems and to perform other emission-related
   diagnosis and repair from each vehicle manufacturer...
