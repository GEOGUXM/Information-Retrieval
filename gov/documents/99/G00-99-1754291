                                KALEIDOSCOPE

   Join host Susan Logue as she examines different aspects of American
   Culture on Kaleidoscope.  We'll visit museums, go to the theatre and
   concert hall, attend festivals, and profile some of the people who have
   shaped American culture and continue to shape it today.  From
   contemporary performances to folk traditions, Kaleidoscope is your
   cultural tour of the United States!

   Susan Logue Kaleidoscope is hosted by Susan Logue, who has been
   reporting on American culture for the Voice of America since 1985.
   When not attending the theater, concerts or exhibition openings, Susan
   enjoys hiking and traveling with her husband.  She invites you to write
   to her with questions, comments or suggestions about the program.
