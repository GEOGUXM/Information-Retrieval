   Current NPOESS Projects and Demonstrations

        * WindSat: Joint DoD/IPO Risk Reduction Demo
          WindSat measures ocean surface wind speed and wind direction.
        * NPOESS Aircraft Sounder Testbed (NAST)
          NAST creates an environment in which NPOESS instruments can be
          tested under conditions that simulate the space environment. NAST
          will be used to simulate possible satellite-based measurements
          useful in experimental validation of different instrument system
          specifications and data processing techniques for future advanced
          atmospheric remote sensors.
        * Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) activities
          PDRR is the path leading to the Engineering Manufacturing and
          Development phase. It encompasses system architecture studies,
          program definition, spacecraft interface studies, and ground
          segment demonstrations.
        * NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP)
          NPP is a joint NPOESS/NASA instrument risk reduction project. Its
          mission is to provide advanced technology for atmospheric sounding,
          giving continuing observations about global change after EOS-AM
          (Terra) and EOS-PM (Aqua). NPP focuses on the following sensors:
             + VIIRS
             + CrIS
             + ATMS
