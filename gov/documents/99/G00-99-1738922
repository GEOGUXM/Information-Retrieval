   Sandwich-Box-Size Web Pods

   While the housing may look like a plastic sandwich box, this small
   device may someday play a critical role in solar system exploration. A
   group of these devices, or pods, can be collected together to form a
   new type of instrument called a sensor web. The individual pods contain
   both sensors that collect information from the surrounding environment
   and communication chips that transmit the data to other pods. The data
   finally arrives at a primary pod where it is then transmitted to the
   internet or an overhead satellite. Sensor webs can be deployed from
   spacecraft to the surface of another planet, providing scientists here
   on Earth with a map of that planet's environmental factors. This
   capability will help investigators evaluate environmental conditions
   and determine if life is possible, or has ever been possible, on a
   planet.

   Sensor webs may also be used on Earth. Scientists developed the pods
   shown to build an instrument that detects and monitors gaseous
   biosignatures. This type of sensor web is currently being placed in
   garden environments to monitor botanical conditions. Sensor webs
   provide the opportunity for planetary scientists and biologists to have
   a continual virtual presence in an area, greatly aiding the study and
   monitoring of ecosytems. Precision environmental measurements in
   hard-to-reach environments, such as steep canyon walls or ocean floors
   will also be possible.
