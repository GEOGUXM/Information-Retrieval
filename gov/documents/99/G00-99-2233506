   [vspacer.gif]   High Performance Computing Research

   NERSC is committed to constantly rethinking the four elements of
   scientific computing -- mathematical modeling, algorithmic design,
   software implementation, and system architecture. Our High Performance
   Computing Research Department conducts research and development in
   these areas and evaluates new and promising technologies. Our users'
   needs for computational robustness, reliability, and efficiency provide
   a solid testbed for new ideas and designs.

   NERSC's scientific computing specialists bridge the gap between new
   computing technologies and scientific research. Their mission is to
   facilitate development of scientific applications that run on NERSC
   capability platforms and to promote the optimal use of NERSC computing
   resources. Their responsibilities include collaborating with strategic
   users to port and develop scientific applications, as well as
   evaluating, integrating, and creating new hardware and software
   technologies and new numerical and non-numerical algorithms -- in
   short, developing new computational approaches to scientific problems.

   The High Performance Computing Research Department consists of eight
   groups:

     * The Applied Numerical Algorithms Group
     * The Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics (CBCG)
     * The Center for Computational Sciences and Engineering (CCSE)
     * The Future Technologies Group
     * The Imaging and Collaborative Computing Group
     * The Scientific Computing Group
     * The Scientific Data Management Research and Development Group
     * The Visualization Group

   Current projects, products, and services include:

     * ACTS Toolkit support: a DOE2000 project
     * Adaptive mesh refinement software and research
     * The Alternative Splicing Database, which provides information about
       alternatively spliced genes, their products, and expression
       patterns
     * BiSyCLES, a system that searches multiple biological databases
       simultaneously
     * Chombo: Adaptive mesh refinement C++ class library
     * CLAPACK: full set of LAPACK in C
     * Cosmic microwave background data analysis: algorithmic scaling
     * Data Management Research and Development
     * Embedded boundary algorithms for fluid dynamics modeling
     * Evaluation of High Performance Fortran for scientific applications
     * FoldPred, a program that predicts the protein fold classification
       for any amino acid sequence
     * Fortran 77 solvers: BLZPACK, HLZPACK, and SKYPACK (Block LancZos
       PACKage, Hermitian LancZos PACKage, and SKYline PACKage)
     * The Genome Channel, a prototype web-based graphic interface using
       standard annotation for all genome sequences completed to date
     * M-VIA: A high performance modular VIA (Virtual Interface
       Architecture) for Linux
     * Modular Ocean Model development
     * The OPTIMASS Project: enabling technology for rapid analysis of
       earth science and environmental data
     * PARATEC: PARAllel Total Energy Code (a materials science total
       energy planewave pseudopotential code)
     * PC Cluster Project: developing software for easy-to-use
       "plug-n-play" PC clusters
     * PLANSO: a parallel Lanczos program in MPI
     * Prototype Array Database
     * The Resource for Molecular Cytogenetics, a joint project with the
       Cancer Genetics Program at the University of California, San
       Francisco
     * Scientific computing seminars: a research/study group for NERSC
       staff
     * Semilocal string simulations
     * Sparse linear algebra algorithms for MPPs
     * Storage management for high energy and nuclear physics data
     * SuperLU: sequential and parallel libraries to solve unsymmetric
       sparse linear systems based on LU factorization
     * TRLan: a software implementation of the thick-restart Lanczos
       method
     * Visualization research

   To help educate the next generation of computational scientists, NERSC
   sponsors the Luis W. Alvarez Postdoctoral Fellowship in Computational
   Science.

   [vspacer.gif]   Distributed Systems

   Expanding the capabilities of the DOE Science Grid testbed is the focus
   of NERSC's new Distributed Systems Department, which joined the NERSC
   Division in February 2000 as part of the reorganization of Berkeley
   Lab's Computing Sciences Directorate.

   The Science Grid will provide significant new capabilities to
   scientists and engineers, allowing them to address complex and
   large-scale computing and data analysis problems beyond what is
   possible today. The Distributed Systems Department is conducting
   research and development into various components of the Science Grid
   infrastructure, including:

     * Collaboration Technologies
     * Distributed Security Research
     * Data Intensive Distributed Computing
          + Distributed-Parallel Storage System (DPSS)
          + Java Agents for Monitoring and Management (JAMM)
          + The NetLogger Toolkit: real-time diagnosis of performance
            problems in complex high-performance distributed systems
     * Networking

   As a national facility for scientific research, funded by the
   Department of Energy, Office of Science, NERSC annually serves about
   2,000 scientists throughout the United States and overseas. These
   researchers work in DOE laboratories, universities, industry, and other
   Federal agencies. Computational science conducted at NERSC covers the
   entire range of scientific disciplines, but is focused on research that
   supports the DOE's mission and scientific goals.
