Welcome!

   Argonne National Laboratory's technology transfer program is directed
   toward enhancing the Laboratory's research and development programs,
   meeting federal, national, and international research needs, and
   increasing the worldwide competitiveness of U.S. industry.

   Industrial firms and other organizations (including federal, state and
   local governments and academic institutions) can benefit from Argonne's
   know-how and intellectual property in cutting-edge technologies, often
   leveraging their own in-house capabilities. Argonne can work with these
   organizations in a variety of ways, including
     * Cost-shared research and development,
     * Reimbursable R&D (Work-for-Others),
     * Licensing,
     * Technical assistance, and
     * Personnel exchange.

   Argonne's Office of Technology Transfer is ready to help you determine
   how your company can benefit through a relationship with Argonne.  You
   can reach us at 800-627-2596 or partners@anl.gov.
