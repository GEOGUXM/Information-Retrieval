Notice: Indiana streamflow-gaging stations discontinued on January 1, 2002.

   Indiana stations that have operations discontinued as a result of
   reduced funding are listed below. These stations were discontinued as
   of January 1, 2002.

   We wish to thank the cooperators that picked up funding for many of the
   threatened stations. It is important to note that in some cases as a
   result of cooperators shifting funding support from stations that they
   previously funded to threatened stations they considered more important
   to their program, the original list of discontinued stations has
   changed a great deal.

   While all stations are important to the base of hydrologic knowledge,
   with the exception of Deer Creek all of the stations now on the list of
   discontinued stations are not real-time (internet displayed stations).
