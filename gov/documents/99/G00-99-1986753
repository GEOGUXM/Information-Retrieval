   Occupation Orders California Minimum Wage MW-2001 Minimum Wage - Every
   employer shall pay to each employee wages not less than the following:
   $6.25 $6.75 per hour beginning January 1, 2001 per hour beginning
   January 1, 2002 To employers and representatives of persons working in
   industries and occupations in the State of California: SUMMARY OF
   ACTIONS TAKE NOTICE that on October 23, 2000, the Industrial Welfare
   Commission (IWC), having proceeded according to its authority in the
   Labor Code and Constitution of California, Article 14, ยง 1, amended
   Sections 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the General Minimum Wage Order, MW-98.
   Section 4, Separability, has not been changed. The IWC adopted
   increases to the minimum wage and to meals and lodging credits in this
   general minimum wage order and in all of the IWC's industry and
   occupation orders. The IWC also repealed and/or amended the following
   non- statutory full and partial exemptions from the minimum wage for
   certain employees that are contained in this order as well as in its
   industry and occupation orders: student nurses, professional actors,
   full-time carnival ride operators, employees of the State or local
   governments and any political subdivision thereof, personal attendants
   in private homes except for persons under the age of eighteen who are
   employed as baby sitters for a minor child of the employer in the
   employer's home, and minors paid not less than 85% of the minimum wage
   rounded to the nearest nickel. The present partial exemption for
   learners was amended to include minors. The IWC took these actions
   after holding investigative public hearings as required by Labor Code ยง
   1178, considering the report of the Wage Board on the minimum wage
   selected pursuant to Labor Code ยง 1178.5, and subsequently holding
   public hearings according to the requirements of Labor Code ยง 1181.
   This summary must be made available to employees in accordance with the
   IWC's wage orders. Copies of the full text of the amended wage orders
   may be obtained at www.dir.ca.gov/IWC or by mail from the IWC. 1.
   APPLICABILITY The provisions of this Order shall not apply to outside
   salespersons and individuals who are the parent, spouse, or children of

   and occupation orders. The IWC has eliminated other exemptions from the
   minimum wage previously contained in this Order and in sections of the
   IWC's industry and occupation orders. (See Section 5, Amended
   Provisions, below.) Exceptions and modifications provided by statute or
   in Section 1, Applicability, and in other sections of the IWC's
   industry and occupation orders may be used where any such provisions
   are enforceable and applicable to the employer. 2. MINIMUM WAGES Every
   employer shall pay to each employee wages not less than six dollars and
