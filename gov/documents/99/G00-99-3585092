                    History of the LPS Development Effort
     __________________________________________________________________

   The need for an automated launch processing system at KSC evolved from
   the Shuttle Transportation System (STS) requirements that included the
   need for rapid launch turnaround to meet the projected launch rate and
   program economic objectives.

   In June 1972, after analysis of Shuttle processing requirements, the
   LPS concept, which led to the present Launch Processing System (LPS)
   configuration, was baselined. The LPS preliminary design review was
   completed in September 1975, and the critical design review was
   completed a year later. Firing Room integration and applications
   software development began in 1977.

   Many NASA and contractor organizations were heavily involved during
   these years in requirements definition, design, development,
   implementation, integration and validation of these hardware and
   software systems. The KSC Directorate of Design Engineering provided
   overall integration of the project and NASA development teams within
   Design Engineering, and the Directorate of Technical Support provided
   technical integration within their areas of responsibility. Major
   contracts were awarded for development and implementation of the
   principal subsystems. Martin Marietta was contractually responsible for
   developing and integrating the control and monitoring system hardware,
   which included the Firing Room consoles, front-end processors, hardware
   interface modules, and peripheral systems. Modular Computer, Inc.
   provided the minicomputer systems, including ModComp CPUs, the
   peripherals, and the peripheral controllers. IBM developed and
   integrated most of the systems and interfacing software for this
   equipment. Honeywell Information Systems provided the hardware and
   systems software for the large-scale central computer systems. KSC
   in-house personnel developed the hardware/software interfaces between
   the major subsystems, most of the applications software, and most of
   the telemetry recording and playback capability. The systems were
   integrated and became operational in December 1977. Initial operations
   support began with OPF processing of STS-1 on March 27, 1979, and
   culminated with the STS first manned orbital flight on April 12, 1981.
