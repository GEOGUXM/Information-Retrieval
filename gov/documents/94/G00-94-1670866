   LG 223 LBNL-41648 Energy Efficient Torchieres: From the Laboratory to
   the Marketplace, Siminovitch, M.; Page, E.; Driscoll, D., April 1998
   ACEEE 1998 Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings, August
   23-28, 1998, Pacific Grove, California, and published in the
   Proceedings..
   Abstract: This paper describes the history, technology development,
   technology transfer and application of the energy efficient compact
   fluorescent torchiere. A review of the essential efforts that went into
   the development of the first commercially available CFL torchiere
   technologies is described. Also included is a review of the performance
   issues related to lumen matching capabilities. Furthermore, the paper
   overviews the critical steps and successes that occurred as this
   technology made the transition from laboratory to marketplace.

   The energy efficient torchiere promises to have one of the single
   largest energy saving potentials of any DSM program developed to date.
   This project represents unique spectrum of industry-laboratory
   collaborations and addresses an important national energy and safety
   problem.

   LG 221 LBNL-46238 Integrated Lighting Approach Saves Energy in Post
   Office Facilities, Mitchell, Jeffrey C.; Siminovitch, Michael J.; Page,
   Eric R.; Gauna, Kevin W.; and Avery, Douglas A., June 2000 To be
   presented at the 2000 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in
   Buildings, August 20-25, 2000, Pacific Grove, CA
   Abstract: The United States Postal Service (USPS) has made numerous
   efforts to improve the lighting quality and efficiency in their
   facilities. These efforts have included both traditional retrofits such
   as the transition to T8 lamps/electronic ballasts and more experimental
   approaches such as light pipes and sulfur lamps. However, these efforts
   have focused primarily on their industrial and plant facilities and
   have had little impact on their small and medium sized facilities,
   which comprise roughly 90% of their total building stock. These efforts
   have also neglected the affinity between task and ambient lighting
   functions.

   The objective of this project was to develop and demonstrate an
   integrated lighting system that saves energy while improving the
   lighting distribution and quality in small and medium sized USPS
   facilities. Work included the evolution of a novel task lighting
   fixture designed explicitly to improve the light distribution within
   the carrier case letter sorting station. The new task light system was
   developed to work in combination with a high efficiency, low-glare
   ambient lighting system mounted on the ceiling. The use of
   high-performance task lighting allowed the ambient lighting component
   to be reduced, thereby limiting the amount of glare produced and
   reducing the amount of energy consumed.

   LG 220 LBNL-46009 IBECS: An Integrated Building Environmental
   Communications SystemÑItÕs Not Your FatherÕs Network, Rubinstein,
   Francis and Johnson, Stephen, June 2000 To be presented at the 2000
   ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings, August 20-25,
   2000, Pacific Grove, CA
   Abstract: The paper presents the technical design concept for a
   low-cost building communications network that will allow most building
   equipment loads, including individual light fixtures, operable window
   blinds, motors and environmental sensors, to be controlled and
   monitored from an existing Ethernet. IBECS (Integrated Building
   Environmental Communications System) is a practical networking system
   that will provide building managers with an unprecedented degree of
   control over most building electrical loads, allowing them to implement
   load shedding, real time pricing and aggregated building load
   strategies with confidence. At the same time, IBECS will let individual
   occupants exert appropriate control over their environmental conditions
   (light and, ultimately, heat), initially using a virtual control panel
   served from their web browser, and eventually through voice command.
   Recent developments in hardware and software have enabled this new
   networking concept. New manufacturing techniques can produce
   semiconductor devices that incorporate a microprocessor, unique IP
   address, controller, and simple LAN communications for $0.25/chip. The
   private sector is already hugely invested in software that makes
   appliances, peripherals and telecommunications devices addressable via
   the Internet (e.g., Sun Microsystem's Jini technologyÑa software
   infrastructure for providing services on a network). Because it
   directly exploits recent developments in hardware and software that are
   far beyond the development capabilities of the building industry, IBECS
   could provide the infrastructure that, for the first time, truly
   integrates the operation of building equipment to improve both human
   and building performance.

   LG 219 LBNL-43096REV Comparison of Control Options in Private Offices
   in an Advanced Lighting Controls Testbed, Jennings, Judith D.,
   Rubinstein, Francis M., DiBartolomeo, Dennis, April 2000 To be
   presented at the 1999 IESNA Annual Conference, New Orleans, LA, August
   9, 1999 and to be published in the Proceedings. Submitted to the JIES
   for publication. This report supercedes LBNL-43096, LG-214
   Abstract: In a major test of different lighting control technologies in
   a typical office building, we present analyses of seven months' results
   from five control scenarios in private offices. We compare the energy
   savings and effectiveness of various combinations of occupant
   detection, daylight dimming, and switching techniques. Comparing
   measured energy use with occupant sensors against baseline energy use
   calculated using wall

   switch operation only, we found that occupant sensors saved 20-26%
   lighting energy compared to manual switching alone. In offices where
   light sensor controls were installed and properly commissioned,
   additional savings up to 27% for a total of 46% were obtained over a
   seven-month period, even in an area with unusually high minimum
   lighting requirements. Dimming the lighting system to desired task
   levels (task tuning) also resulted in significant (23% additional, 43%
   total) energy savings in overlit areas. On the base case floor, where
   only bi-level switches were installed, we found significant usage of
   only one switch resulting in an additional 23% savings over
   single-level switches-an unexpected result withimplications for
   building code requirements.

   We found that the energy savings due to occupant sensing vs. dimming
   depended on the behavior of occupants. In offices whose occupants
   tended to stay at their desks all day, dimming controls saved more
   energy, and vice versa. The lighting requirements of occupants appear
   to depend on their type of work.

   LG 218 LBNL-41679 Advanced Lighting Program Development (BG9702800)
   Final Report, Rubinstein, Francis; Johnson, Steve, February 1998
   Prepared for CIEE
   Abstract: The report presents a long-range plan for a broad-based,
   coordinated research, development and market transformation program for
   reducing the lighting energy intensities in commercial and residential
   buildings in California without compromising lighting quality.

   An effective program to advance lighting energy efficiency in
   California must be based on an understanding that lighting is a mature
   field and the lighting industry has developed many specialized products
   that meet a wide variety of light needs for different building types.
   Above all else, the lighting field is diverse and there are
   applications for a wide range of lighting products, systems, and
   strategies.

   Given the range of existing lighting solutions, an effective energy
   efficient lighting research portfolio must be broad-based and diverse
   to match the diversity of the lighting market itself. The belief that
   there is one solutionÑa "magic bullet," such as a better lamp, for
   exampleÑthat will propel lighting efficiency across all uses to new
   heights is, in our opinion, an illusion. A multi-path program is the
   only effective means to raising lighting efficiency across all lighting
   applications in all building types.

   This report presents a list of 27 lighting technologies and concepts
   (key activities) that could form the basis of a coordinated research
   and market transformation plan for significantly reducing lighting
   energy intensities in California buildings. The total 27 key activities
   into seven broad classes as follows:

   Light sources

   Ballasts

   Luminaires

   Lighting Controls

   Lighting Systems in Buildings

   Human Factors

   Education

   Each of the above technology classes is discussed in terms of
   background, key activities, and the energy savings potential for the
   state. The report concludes that there are many possibilities for
   targeted research, development, and market transformation activities
   across all sectors of the building lighting industry. A concerted
   investment by the state to foster efficiency improvements in lighting
   systems in commercial and residential buildings would have a major
   positive impact on energy use and environmental quality in California.

   LG 217 LBNL-44448 Lighting Energy Savings Opportunities in Hotel
   Guestrooms: Results from a scoping study at the Redondo Beach Crown
   Plaza, Page, Erik and Siminovitch, Michael, October 1999 ACEEE Summer
   Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings, August 20-25, 2000, Pacific
   Grove, CA
   Abstract: A study was conducted by LBNL/DOE in order to better
   understand the lighting usage and energy consumption patterns in
   typical hotel guestrooms. This involved a multi-phase research,
   development and demonstration program. This program started with the
   identification and characterization of common lighting technologies in
   hotel guestrooms and ended in the measurement and monitoring of newly
   developed and existing technologies at a hotel test site. Emphasis was
   placed on determining where lighting energy was being used by guests
   and identifying the savings potentials that energy efficient
   technologies could present. Initial data indicates that compact
   fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and occupancy sensors offer significant energy
   savings potentials in hotel guestrooms.

   LG 216 LBNL-43782 Creating Markets For New Products To Replace
   Incandescent Lamps: The International Experience, Rubinstein, Francis;
   Borg, Nils; Horowitz, Noah; Narel, Tracy; Morehouse, Thomas E. Jr.,
   March 1998 1998 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings
   Proceedings, August 23-28, 1998, Pacific Grove, CA
   Abstract: Since the summer of 1995, several organizations have been in
   pursuit of what many consider the "Holy Grail" of lighting technologyÑa
   low-cost, drop-in, energy-efficient replacement for the incandescent
   lamp. This paper summarizes the international experience in attempting
   to catalyze the commercialization of a mass-market replacement product
   that could have a major impact on residential lighting energy
   consumption in U.S. and EU homes.

   The technology procurement effort was originally spearheaded by the
   U.S. Federal Government through a loose collaboration between the
   Department of Defense (DOD), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
   and the Department of Energy (DOE). The DOD agreed to serve as the
   "anchor buyer" for a low-cost, drop-in replacement product for
   standard-sized light bulbs that provide at least 30% energy savings
   compared to traditional incandescent lamps. In parallel to the U.S.
   effort, the International Energy Agency launched a cooperative
   technology procurement effort by assembling large buyersÕ groups in
   Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom to "pull" a
   similar efficient lighting product into the European market. The
   lukewarm response from lamp manufacturers to these two technology
   procurement efforts illustrates the challenges of transforming
   residential lighting from incandescent to efficient lighting.

   Controls Testbed, Rubinstein F., Jennings J., Avery D., Blanc S., March
   1998 Presented at the IESNA 1998 Annual Conference, San Antonio, TX,
   August 10-12, 1998, and published in JIES Winter 1999.
   Abstract: Preliminary results from a large-scale testbed of advanced
   lighting control technologies at the Phillip Burton Federal Building at
   450 Golden Gate Ave. in San Francisco are presented. The first year
   objective of this project is to determine the sustainable energy
   savings and cost-effectiveness of different lighting control
   technologies compared to a portion of the building where only minimal
   controls are installed. The paper presents the analyzed results from
   six months of tests focused on accurately characterizing the energy
   savings potential of one type of daylight-linked lighting controls
   compared to the lighting in similar open-planned areas without dimming
   controls. After analyzing a half yearÕs data, we determined that the
   annual energy savings for this type of daylight-linked controls was 41%
   and 30% for the outer rows of lights on the South and North sides of
   the building, respectively. The annual energy savings dropped to 22%
   and 16% for the second row of lights for the South and North,
   respectively, and was negligible for the third rows of lights.

   LG 211 LBNL-41176 New Energy Efficient Torchieres Ready for Hot
   Torchiere Market, Page, Erik; Mills, Evan, and Siminovitch, Michael,
   November 1997 Proceedings of the Energy Efficiency in Household
   Appliances Conference, November 5-8, 1997, Florence, Italy.
   Abstract: The extraordinary market growth of the high power halogen
   torchiere (halogen uplighter) presents significant global energy
   savings opportunities for energy efficient alternatives. Extensive
   development of prototype designs of energy efficient torchiere systems
   using compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) has lead directly to the
   production and commercialization of CFL torchieres. This paper analyzes
   the current global market for torchieres and compares the electrical
   and photometric characteristics of one of the new CFL torchieres to
   standard tungsten halogen torchieres. Power assessments and photometric
   data indicate that the new CFL torchiere provides significant energy
   savings over the standard tungsten halogen torchiere while producing
   more luminous flux. The energy savings is jointly due to the high
   source efficacy of the CFLs and the poor performance of many cheaply
   made halogen lamps. Laboratory and in-situ experiments indicate that
   the CFL torchieres use 65 Watts to produce 25 percent more light than
   the 300 W tungsten halogen torchieres they are designed to replace.
   Additionally, the CFL torchieres have the benefit of a cooler lamp
   operating temperature, making them safer luminaires (Brooks, 1997; New
   York Times, 1997). This safety benefit, coupled with the potential for
   significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, has prompted
   the insurance industry to form a unique alliance with energy
   conservation groups to promote energy efficient torchieres.

   LG 210 LBNL-40244 Integral CFLs Performance in Table Lamps, Page, Erik,
   March 1997 IESNA 1997 Annual Conference, August 17-20, 1997, Seattle,
   WA
   Abstract: This paper focuses on performance variations associated with
   lamp geometry and distribution in portable table luminaires. If
   correctly retrofit with compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), these high
   use fixtures produce significant energy savings, but if misused, these
   products could instead generate consumer dissatisfaction with CFLs. It
   is our assertion that the lumen distribution of the light source within
   the luminaires plays a critical role in total light output, fixture
   efficiency and efficacy, and, perhaps most importantly, perceived
   brightness. We studied nearly 30 different integral (screw-based) CFLs
   available on the market today in search of a lamp, or group of lamps,
   which work best in portable table luminaires. Our findings conclusively
   indicate that horizontally oriented CFLs outperform all other types of
   CFLs in nearly every aspect.

   LG 209 LBNL-40903 Despite Different Wall Colors, Vertical Scotopic
   Illuminance Predicts Pupil Size, Berman, S.M., Jewett, D.L., Benson,
   B.R., and Law, T.M., November 1996 J of the IES 26 (No. 2) Summer 1997
   Abstract: Previously we have determined, with a full field of view, the
   relative contributions of scotopic and photopic luminance to pupil size
   at light levels typical of building interiors. Those studies were
   carried out in a white room with uniform reflectance, and with the
   viewed surfaces having an approximately uniform luminance distribution.
   To enhance the usefulness of the past results to lighting practice, we
   have constructed a simulated office where the viewed walls can have one
   of four very different colors, with quite different luminance
   distributions. This allows examination of interaction effects between
   wall spectral reflectivity and light source spectral distribution.

   In the present study pupil sizes were obtained while subjects were
   viewing a very small screen television. A remote pupillometer was used,
   allowing subjects to sit in a comfortable chair without the
   inconvenience of chin rests or head gear. Seventeen subjects between
   the ages of 27 and 47 years were studied using illumination provided by
   conventional lamps, either a WW or a daylight fluorescent lamp. Pupil
   size variation was predicted by the value of the scotopic vertical
   illuminance at the eye. Even though the WW lamps are 50% more
   efficacious than daylight lamps in terms of photopic lumens per watt,
   daylight lamps can be as much as twice as efficacious in eliciting
   pupil size.

   LG 208 LBNL-40507 Photometric Assessment of Energy Efficient
   Torchieres, Page, E.; Siminovitch, M., June 1997 Proceedings of the
   Right Light 4 Conference, November 19-21, 1997, Copenhagen, Denmark.
   Abstract: Extensive development of designs and prototyping of energy
   efficient torchiere systems using compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) has
   lead directly to the production of CFL torchieres by a major US
   manufacturer. This paper compares the electrical and photometric
   characteristics of one of the new CFL torchieres to standard tungsten
   halogen torchieres (halogen uplighters). Power assessments and
   gonio-photometric data indicate that the new CFL torchiere provides
   significant energy savings over the standard tungsten halogen torchiere
   while producing more luminous flux. The energy savings is jointly due
   to the high source efficacy of the CFLs and the poor performance of the
   imported halogen lamps.

   The paper also presents results from a test site in the student
   dormitories at Stanford University where a torchiere "lamp swap"
   program was initiated in which students voluntarily traded their
   halogen torchieres for CFL torchieres. Out of the 500 torchieres
   involved in the lamp swap, a random sample of nearly 100 halogen lamps
   (seasoned in the field and considered to represent a typical
   population) were collected and photometrically and electrically
   characterized in the laboratory. These laboratory results indicate that
   the CFL torchieres use 65 watts to produce 25 percent more light than
   the 300 W tungsten halogen torchieres they are designed to replace.
   Additionally, the CFL torchieres have the benefit of a cooler lamp
   operating temperature, making them safer luminaires.

   LG 207 LBNL-41010 On the Calibration and Commissioning of Lighting
   Controls, Rubinstein, F., Avery, D., Jennings, J., Blanc, S., October
   1997 Proceedings of the Right Light 4 Conference, November 19-21, 1997,
   Copenhagen, Denmark.
   Abstract: Lighting controls have the potential to capture significant
   energy savings in commercial buildings if properly specified,
   installed, commissioned and maintained. Proper commissioning is often
   absent in lighting projects and the lack of commissioning can
   significantly reduce a projectÕs energy savings potential. The paper
   focuses on the importance of good commissioning practice for obtaining
   satisfactory performance from lighting control systems and discusses
   the difficulties of commissioning todayÕs systems. Some practical
   suggestions for commissioning lighting controls is offered as well as
   advice to specifiers and early adopters to aid them in selecting
   controls that are most appropriate to their requirements.

   LG 206 LBNL-40243 Energy Efficient Alternatives to Halogen Torchieres,
   Siminovitch, M.; Marr, L.; Mitchell, J.; Page, E., March 1997 IESNA
   1997 Annual Conference, August 17-20, 1997, Seattle, WA
   Abstract: A series of novel energy efficient torchiere systems have
   been developed using compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). These systems
   were studied photometrically and compared with the performance of
   traditional commercially available tungsten halogen sources.
   Gonio-photometric data and power assessments indicate that significant
   lighting energy savings can be obtained by utilizing CFL sources
   instead of standard tungsten halogen sources. This energy savings is
   jointly due to the higher source efficacy of the CFLs and the
   surprisingly poor performance of the imported 300 Watt halogen lamps.
   Experimental data shows that a 50 to 60 Watt CFL will effectively lumen
   match a variety of 300 Watt tungsten halogen sources with 5 to 10 times
   the efficacy. CFL torchieres have additional benefits of higher power
   quality and cooler lamp operating temperature, making them safer
   fixtures

   1997 Proceedings of the Right Light 4 Conference, November 19-21, 1997,
   Copenhagen, Denmark.
   Abstract: High-lumen light sources represent unique challenges and
   opportunities for the design of practical and efficient interior
   lighting systems. High-output sources require a means of large-scale
   distribution and avoidance of high-luminance glare while providing
   efficient delivery. An indirect lighting system has been developed for
   use with a 1000 Watt sulfur lamp that efficiently utilizes the
   high-output source to provide quality interior lighting. This paper
   briefly describes the design and initial testing of this new system.

   Tribwell L., May 1996 Presented at the 1996 IESNA Annual Conference,
   Cleveland, Ohio, August 5-7, 1996, and published in JIES Summer 1997.
   Abstract: This report provides background data upon which residential
   lighting fixture energy conservation programs can be built. The current
   stock of residential lighting is described by usage level, lamp
   wattage, fixture type, and location within the house. Data are
   discussed that indicate that 270% of incandescent residential fixtures
   are responsible for over 805% of residential lighting energy use, and
   that justify targeting these fixtures as candidates for retrofit with
   energy-efficient fixtures. Fixtures determined to have the highest
   energy use are hardwired ceiling fixtures in kitchens, portable
   fixtures in living/family rooms, hardwired fixtures in dining rooms,
   and hardwired fixtures outdoors. An assessment of the market for
   residential fixtures shows that nearly half of new residential fixtures
   are imported, about 60% of new fixtures sold are hardwired, and about
   half of all new fixtures sold are for ceiling installation.

   Conference, NY 7/29-8/3/95.
   Abstract: This paper describes the results of a photometric and energy
   analysis that was conducted on a new light guide and sulfur lamp system
   recently installed at the U.S. Department of EnergyÕs Forrestal
   Building. This novel system couples two high lumen output, high
   efficiency sulfur lamps to a single 73 m (240 ft.) hollow light guide
   lined with a reflective prismatic film. The system lights a large
   roadway and plaza area that lies beneath a section of the building. It
   has been designed to completely replace the grid of 280 mercury vapor
   lamps formerly used to light the space. This paper details the results
   of a field study that characterizes the significant energy savings and
   increased illumination levels that have been achieved. Comparisons to
   modeled HID lighting scenarios are also included.

   LG 199 LBL-37023 Relationships Between the VL and Reaction Time Models,
   Clear, Robert, July 1995 JIES, Vol. 25, No. 2 (1996) pp. 14-24.
   Abstract: The VL concept is based on measurements of accuracy
   thresholds where response times are essentially unlimited. Rea has
   produced a visual performance model based on reaction times, which
   include response times. Analysis of phenomena such as the Pulfrich
   illusion suggest that there is a delay time between signal onset and
   recognition that depends upon the adaptation luminance. This suggests
   an analysis of reaction times in terms of a simple sum of a signal
   strength (VL) term plus response term(s), including a delay term. A
   comparison of ReaÕs reaction time Êmodel and this additive VL model
   showed that the models are similar, but that the VL model fits the data
   better and has a more consistent theoretical foundation.

   The luminance-dependent response term appears to be needed to fit
   performance on the numerical verification task developed by Rea, but
   not the word chart reading task developed by Bailey. The above additive
   VL model suggests that the difference may depend on whether the task is
   processed serially and includes the delay time, or is processed in
   parallel and does not.

   LG 195 LBL-37010 A Comparative Candlepower Distribution Analysis for
   Compact Fluorescent Table Lamp Systems, E. Page, C. Praul and M.
   Siminovitch, July 1995 JIES 26(1) Winter 1997
   Abstract: The residential lighting sector represents a significant
   opportunity for energy conservation due to the almost exclusive use of
   inefficient incandescent sources. Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) have
   the potential to transform this market by using one fourth as much
   power as an incandescent to provide the same amount of light. While
   technical advances such as triphosphors and electronic ballasts have
   addressed issues of color rendition, flicker, and hum, CFLs still face
   significant market barriers, particularly their Ôperceived brightnessÕ
   level in traditional fixture applications. When operated in fixtures
   originally designed for A-lamps, CFLs with equal total lumen packages
   can appear dimmer due to differences in their light distributions. One
   such fixture, the common table lamp, is typically operated for more
   than 3 hours a day, and thus represents a significant opportunity for
   energy savings. LBL conducted a series of goniophotometric candela
   distribution studies of table lamps with the initial objective of
   matching with CFLs the light distribution of the consumer accepted
   A-lamp. While goniometric testing was done on numerous CFL and
   incandescent sources, this paper focuses on three typical sources which
   have very different distributions. Our photometric studies indicate
   that horizontally oriented CFLs may produce a more desirable
   distribution than either A-lamps or vertically oriented CFLs by
   minimizing shade losses and thus maximizing the amount of useful light
   leaving the fixture. Optimizing fixture geometry and lamp position can
   significantly increase the efficiency of these CFL fixtures. Ongoing
   research with the fixture industry seeks to identify and develop
   efficient source/fixture configurations.

   Clear and Richard G. Mistrick, June 1995 JIES, Vol. 25, No. 2, 1995
   Abstract: Multi-layer polarizing panels are a technology that has been
   proposed for improving lighting quality in interior environments.
   Different authors have examined a variety of different conditions, have
   used different performance models in their evaluation of the potential
   of this technology, and have come to markedly different conclusions.
   This paper discusses how variations in conditions and performance
   models affect the evaluation of the performance potential of polarized
   lighting systems. The importance of the light source-task-eye geometry,
   which determines the benefit that can be achieved with polarizing
   luminaires, is discussed in detail.

   Siminovitch, 06/1995 Proceedings of the Right Light Three Conference.
   Newcastle Upon Tyne, England 18-21 June 1995.
   Abstract: This paper describes the results of a photometric and energy
   analysis that was conducted on a new light guide and sulfur lamp system
   recently installed at both the U.S. Department of EnergyÕs Forrestal
   building and the Smithsonian InstitutionÕs National Air and Space
   Museum. This system couples high lumen output, high efficiency sulfur
   lamps to hollow light guides lines with a reflective prismatic film. At
   the Forrestal building the system lights a large roadway and plaza area
   that lies beneath a section of the building. It has been designed to
   completely replace the grid of 280 mercury vapor lamps formerly used to
   illuminate the space. At the National Air and Space Museum a similar
   system illuminates Gallery 114, which houses the large rocket displays
   from the U.S. Space program. This paper outlines the unique operational
   and design characteristics of this hightly efficient distribution
   system and details the results of field studies that characterize the
   significant energy savings and increased illumination levels that have
   been achieved. The projected savings in maintenance costs, due to
   longer lamp life and a reduction of the total number of lamps, is also
   presented.
