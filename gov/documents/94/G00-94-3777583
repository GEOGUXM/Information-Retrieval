   California Pre-Intern
   Since 1997, California has made significant strides toward ensuring a
   well-prepared teaching force with opportunities for pre-intern teachers
   to receive the assistance and support of an experienced teacher and to
   participate in the initial phase of the "Learning to Teach" continuum.
   Pre-Interns begin the first step toward becoming a fully credentialed
   teacher with help in teaching skills and subject matter preparation.
