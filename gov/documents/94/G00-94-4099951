      The Air Quality Division issues air quality permits to regulated
    businesses, monitors ambient air for pollutants, writes the Maricopa
      County Air Pollution Control Rules & Regulations, and determines
     facility compliance. The Division sets the long range direction for
                      clean air within Maricopa County.
    Air Quality Permit Engineers analyze all source applications to guide
      decision making and introduce proposed permits to the public for
       review. Air Quality Inspectors investigate each site to confirm
   facility compliance with the Air Pollution Control Rules & Regulations
   and the facility's specified permit conditions. When compliance is not
   achieved, enforcement action is taken consistent with the Departments
       enforcement policy. The Division is also in charge of Emission
    Inventory, which collects, reviews, stores and manages air pollution
       emissions data from permitted businesses in Maricopa County. In
      addition, the Division handles asbestos renovation and demolition
      activities. A list of air permit fees is available at this site.
   Currently, several power plants have been proposed for Maricopa County.
   You can check on the Power Plant Project Status, which will be updated
                                  monthly.
