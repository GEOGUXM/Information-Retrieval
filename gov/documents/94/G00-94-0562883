   Advanced Technology Program


                    ATP Cross-cutting Technology Clusters

   From 1994-1998, the bulk of ATP funding was applied to specific focused
        program areas--multi-year efforts aimed at achieving specific
    technology and business goals as defined by industry. These programs,
   which funded complementary groups of projects, tackled major technology
    challenges having high payoff potential. The goals often required the
      parallel development of a suite of interlocking R&D projects by a
                         critical mass of companies.

    So many good ideas for focused program have been developed, that ATP
     could not fund them all by holding a separate competition for each.
      Rather than select a handful of focused programs for funding and
      exclude the rest, ATP revised its competition model in 1999. ATP
     competitions are open to all areas of technology. Project proposals
     will be grouped with others in the same technology area in order to
            provide the best possible management of their impact.

    The ATP continues to work with industry, academia, and other research
        organizations to identify overlaps between industry needs and
       prioritize our outreach efforts. ATP will also manage groups of
   interrelated projects together and conduct workshops to share progress
     among awardees and with the public. The focused programs which have
    previously held at least one competition are described below. As new
   projects are funded, they will be clustered in complementary groups for
     management and information sharing purposes - some will be added to
    existing focused programs, and other clusters may define new program
                                   areas.
