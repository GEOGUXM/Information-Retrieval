     Attention all insurance producer licensees! The California Department
     of Insurance (CDI) has arranged with a third party vendor, Innovative
     IT Solutions through their SIRCON Web site, to allow resident licensees
     to renew their insurance licenses online and pay their fees with a
     credit card (VISA or Mastercard).

     All you need to do is use the Renewal Application Process through
     Internet Delivery (RAPID) system to complete your license renewal and
     press ENTER.  This interactive procedure will send your renewal
     application and fees via the Internet to the CDI.  With the RAPID
     system, you will complete your application, pay your fees, and the CDI
     will mail your license to you within two business days.

        The RAPID system allows all insurance producer licensees that are
  California residents to log-on to the CDI's Web site to renew their
  licenses.  The renewal application is the same form you completed
  manually and mailed to the CDI.   Using the RAPID system you may also
  change all addresses that you have on file with the CDI.

  This process will expedite your license renewal.  With a paperless
  renewal application, many delays associated with the renewal process
  will be eliminated.   The RAPID system will provide the producer
  licensee with a confirmation that the CDI received the producer
  licensee's application.  This confirmation will provide you with the
  date your application was received by the CDI and when your fees were
  submitted.  Use the RAPID system to quickly renew your license!

   If you need further assistance, please call the CDI's Producer
   Licensing Bureau at (800) 967-9331 or (916) 322-3555, or send an e-mail
   to License.Bureau@insurance.ca.gov.   Please be sure to include your
   name, telephone number, license number and e-mail address in all
   correspondence with the CDI.
