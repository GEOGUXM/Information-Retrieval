   The United States enjoys the beauty and bounty of coastlines bordered
   by the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Oceans, the Great Lakes, and the
   Gulf of Mexico. Along these 95,000 miles of shoreline, vital and
   sometimes competing activities occur: transportation, trade, and energy
   production, scientific research and education, recreation and tourism,
   protection of historical and cultural artifacts and the habitats of
   many diverse marine creatures.

   Almost half of the U.S. population live and work within the nations
   most ecologically and economically important regions--in an area that
   covers only 11 percent of the country's land. Yet this 11 percent
   supports approximately 190 sea ports, contains most of our largest
   cities and serves as nursery and spawning grounds for marine life. The
   health of our ocean and coastlines are critical to us all--from the
   U.S. commercial and recreational fisheries to American families who
   turn to oceans and coast for recreation.

   Twenty-nine years ago, the nation was stirred into action after a
   devastating oil spill in California blackened beaches and killed large
   numbers of marine animals. In 1972, Congress responded to the threats
   to our coasts and oceans and passed the Coastal Zone Management Act
   (CZMA) and the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act.

   These Acts resulted in the creation of three programs that today work
   to protect and maintain our nations marine and coastal environments:
   The Coastal Zone Management Program, the National Estuarine National
   Research Reserve System, the National Marine Sanctuaries Program.

   The CZMA created a partnership between the Office of the Coastal
   Resource Management (OCRM) and state and territorial governments that
   today leaves day-to-day management decisions at the state level in 33
   states and 21 Reserves and with the OCRM field staff in the 12 National
   Marine Sanctuaries.

 Vision:

         A national system of people and places that protect and manage coastal
         and ocean resources and enable others to do the same.

 Mission:

         Effective management of multiple uses of the nation's coastal and ocean
         resources: protecting and conserving specially designated areas;
         working with partners at all levels; balancing economic, environmental,
         and cultural activities; adapting the system to changing conditions and
         needs; enabling others to practice coastal stewardship; and promoting
         science-based resource management decisions.

   Coastal Zone Management Program

   From the 1972 Act, a federal-state coastal management partnership was
   created to find local solutions to problems with national impact.
   Twenty-eight states and five island territories and commonwealths and
   their associated local governments have developed federally approved
   coastal since the first program was approved in 1974. Together these
   programs manage more than 99 percent of the nation's coastlines. In
   1990 Congress added management of polluted run-off to coastal program
   responsibilities. The coastal nonpoint pollution components of 29 state
   coastal management programs received Federal approval, with conditions,
   as of December 1998.

   The coastal program at the Federal level is administered by the Coastal
   Programs Division (CPD) within OCRM. CPD's role is to advance national
   coastal management initiatives and to maintain and strengthen state
   coastal management through education primarily in the physical, social,
   and biological sciences, land use planning, and public administration.
   Technical areas of support include: federal consistency (with state
   policies), dredging, polluted runoff control, coastal hazards, habitat,
   ocean management, public access and waterfront revitalization.

   National Estuarine National Research Reserve System

   The National Estuarine Research Reserve System also was created out of
   the CZM Act. Today the System maintains a network of field laboratories
   to study estuaries and finds ways to improve their health. Built on a
   foundation of partnerships among state, federal and community
   authorities, the System develops programs for species and habitat
   protection, habitat restoration, and pollution control in nearly
   440,000 acres of U.S. land and water. Each reserve is charged with
   implementing long-term science programs to provide crucial information
   to the community on the ways coastal ecosystems function, how we humans
   impact them, and methods for improving their condition.

   The National Marine Sanctuaries

   Today the National Marine Sanctuaries serves as the foremost advocate
   for conserving the nations marine cultural heritage which includes
   over 18,000 square miles of ocean and coastal waters from the North
   Atlantic to the South Pacific. One sanctuary still in the designation
   process is located in the Great Lakes. Sanctuaries aid in the
   successful recovery of endangered marine animals like the gray whale
   and lessen the threat of oil spills and ship groundings. They increase
   our knowledge of the ocean through research, inspire our children
   through education, and enlarge an ocean ethic of stewardship among our
   nations citizens.

   As the human uses of coastal resources continue to increase, our
   coastal and marine resources are steadily declining in quality in many
   parts of the country. The Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource
   Management is committed to protecting and preserving our coasts and
   oceans for future generations.
