                             SUMMARY/BACKGROUND

      At this point in time, natural resource damage assessment (NRDA)
   restoration is being conducted under a consent decree with the City of
      Seattle and King County. Briefly, the Elliott Bay/Duwamish River
   Restoration Program (EB/DRRP) was established to implement the sediment
   remediation, habitat development, and source control provisions of that
    settlement. It is anticipated that future settlements as a result of
   the assessment process being conducted by EPA as well as other Trustee
     efforts will result in additional NRDA restoration projects in the
                          Elliott Bay environment.

                         POTENTIAL RESTORATION SITES

   The Concept Document summary and the two addenda provide some
   background information on the Program and the evaluation and ranking of
   potential remediation and habitat development sites. A number of
   sediment remediation and habitat development projects under the Program
   have been completed, proposed, or are in the planning and design phase.

   [ballblue.gif] Pier 53/55 Sediment Cap. Twenty-two thousand cubic yards
   of clean sand were placed, one to three feet thick, on 4.5 acres of
   contaminated bottom sediments offshore of Piers 53, 54, and 55, along
   Seattle's downtown waterfront. Contamination consisted of a number of
   chemicals and metals. Monitoring results indicate that the cap is
   stable and isolating contaminated sediments as designed (see Panel
   Publ. #17).

   [ballblue.gif] Norfolk Combined Sewer Overflow. The Norfolk CSO is
   located on the Duwamish River. The overflow effluent volume is
   estimated at approximately 70 million gallons, with efforts being made
   to reduce that volume to an estimated 7-30 million gallons, with the
   addition of a new diversion structure being designed by King County and
   the City. Sampling in 1994 and 1995 indicates that PCBs,
   bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalates, mercury, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene are the
   primary chemicals of concern from this CSO. The Panel evaluated
   contaminated sediment removal methods, developed a cleanup plan and
   environmental assessment, and in March 1999 completed the removal of
   contaminated sediments by mechanical dredging. The Panel will continue
   to monitor for any potential impacts to the project as a result of the
   new diversion structure system. See also Fact Sheet .

   [ballblue.gif] Diagonal/Duwamish Combined Sewer Overflow. This site,
   located downriver from the Norfolk CSO site, was also sampled in 1994
   and 1995. PCBs, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalates, mercury, and butyl benzyl
   phthalates were identified as the primary chemicals of concern. The
   Panel is evaluating preferred cleanup and sediment removal options.
   Preventing recontamination at this site is an integral part of the
   cleanup plans.

   [ballblue.gif] Waterfront Recontamination Study. The Panel sponsored a
   study of Elliott Bay's central waterfront in 1993 to investigate
   sources of contamination, transport and circulation patterns, and
   depositional rates (see Panel Publ. #9, #10). The Panel continues to
   identify restoration opportunities along the central waterfront which
   can be accomplished with the limited funds available.

   [ballblue.gif] Elliott Bay Nearshore. This substrate enhancement
   project is located near the headlands of West Seattle. The goal of the
   project was to try and increase the diversity of habitat and marine
   life. In the Spring of 1998, four different substrates were introduced
   at two subtidal areas off Duwamish Head: oyster shell (10 cubic yards)
   and pea gravel (10 cubic yards) in 2-12 feet, and cobble (5 cubic
   yards) and quarry spall (5 cubic yards) in two different locations in
   35 feet of water. All of the substrate piles were limited to 20 inches
   in height in order to avoid snagging fishing nets and to avoid posing a
   threat to vessels. Sampling of the oyster shell substrate in the summer
   of 1998 revealed that the plot is retaining its integrity and is
   serving as habitat for a variety of marine species (see Panel Publ.
   #19). It is hoped that the Project's success will lead to other, larger
   projects. See also: Fact Sheet and King County's web site for
   additional details on the Panel's Project.

   [ballblue.gif] Herring's House
   Park and Intertidal Habitat Restoration Project (formerly, Seaboard
   Lumber Site Aquatic Habitat Project). The site is a former industrial
   property consisting of 5.7 acres of uplands and 10 acres of tidelands.
   Panel funds were used by the City of Seattle to purchase the property
   in order to restore estuarine wetlands and to provide connectivity
   between two other natural habitat areas. It is intended to provide an
   increase in upper intertidal marsh habitat for salmonid use and add a
   riparian buffer for wildlife use.

   [ballblue.gif] Hamm Creek
   Intertidal Project/City Light North Project. The Panel provided funds
   for the land aquisition (conservation easement), some project
   management activities related to the intertidal portion of this
   project, and authorized and funded King County's development of a
   monitoring program for the Panel's intertidal habitat. In 1999-2000,
   the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under its Section 1135 funding
   program, constructed a new Hamm Creek channel (2,300 feet); a new "fish
   friendly" connection to the Duwamish River; excavated one acre of
   intertidal habitat and two acres of freshwater marsh; and planted
   numerous native trees, shrubs and wetland plants to create a riparian
   buffer.

   [ballblue.gif] Turning Basin No. 3. Turning Basin No. 3 is located at
   the head of navigation for the Duwamish River. Portions of the area are
   being restored to natural wetlands by federal agencies, including NOAA,
   the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Port of Seattle, under a
   Coastal America Partnership. The Panel funded the purchase of
   additional land to increase estuarine habitat, to be held under the
   trusteeship of the Muckleshoot Tribe. Over one acre of mudflats have
   been daylighted by the removal of derelict vessels at the site. The
   commercial pier and shoreside structures will be removed and the area
   will be recontoured and revegetated to provide an enhanced intertidal
   wetland area.

   [ballblue.gif] North Wind's Weir. King County will developing this site
   into both a Panel-funded restoration project at the river's edges and
   an upland King County Parks open space park (pedestrian/ bike trails
   and paths). The restoration project will be constructed in 2001-2002,
   although the King County's park plans have been deferred until a later
   date. The goal of the restoration project is to recreate previously
   lost intertidal habitat and functions necessary for the survival of
   juvenile salmon migrating down the Green/Duwamish River system. The
   restoration project will have 500 feet of intertidal river frontag and
   a one-acre intertidal off-channel lagoon. The upland areas will be
   revegetated with native trees and shrubs to form a riparian buffer. The
   restoration project will be separated from the proposed upland park
   property by vegetation and a wood post-and-rail fence which will
   feature educational signs highlighting the historical and cultural
   significance of the site as well as the habitat features created by
   this project.

   [ballblue.gif] Porter Levee Site. The Porter Levee site is a 30-acre
   parcel adjacent to the Green River. The Panel has contributed
   approximately $390,000.00 toward acquisition costs for this propoerty.
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers provided a similar amount under its
   Section 1135 funding program for construction activities at the site.
   In August 1999, the Corps' construction effort restored the Green
   River's connection to an isolated channel. This reconnection provides
   fish access to an eight-acre side channel and 13 acres of riparian
   wetland, and allows for salmon refuge from high flows and overwintering
   habitat for juveniles. This type of habitat is extremely limited along
   the middle Green River.

   [ballblue.gif] The Panel has expressed its interest in several sites,
   and has requested King County to negotiate their acquisition on behalf
   of the Panel.
