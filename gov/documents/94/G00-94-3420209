   Turner Syndrome Genotype-Phenotype Study

   Protocol Number 00-CH-0219

   This study aims to correlate the clinical features of Turner syndrome
   with the genes responsible for each feature. This study is designed so
   that girls and women (AGES 7 AND UP) with Turner syndrome may benefit
   through extensive investigation of potential medical issues. This study
   will include genetic counseling and provide participants the
   opportunity to discuss their diagnosis, medical and social issues with
   physicians and nurses who are involved in the study. In addition,
   individuals' test results will be provided in printed form for
   participants and their physicians. This study aims to improve the
   preventative and therapeutic medical care for girls and women with
   Turner syndrome.
