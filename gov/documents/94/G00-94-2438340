                               Mission Design:
                          Photometer and Spacecraft

     The Kepler photometer is a simple single purpose instrument. It is
     basically a Schmidt telescope design with a 0.95-meter aperture and
     a 105 deg^2 (about 12 degree diameter) field-of-view (FOV). It is
     pointed at and records data from just a single group of stars for
     the four year duration of the mission.

     The photometer is composed of just one "instrument," which is, an
     array of 42 CCDs (charge couple devices). Each 50x25 mm CCD has
     2200x1024 pixels. The CCDs are read out every three seconds to
     prevent saturation. Only the information from the CCD pixels where
     there are stars brighter than m[v]=14 is recorded. (The CCDs are not
     used to take pictures. The images are intentionally defocused to 10
     arc seconds to improve the photometric precision.) The data are
     integrated for 15 minutes.

     The instrument has the sensitivity to detect an Earth-size transit
     of an m[v]=12 G2V (solar-like) star at 4 sigma in 6.5 hours of
     integration. The instrument has a spectral bandpass from 400 nm to
     850 nm. Data from the individual pixels that make up each star of
     the 100,000 main-sequence stars brighter than m[v]=14 are recorded
     continuously and simultaneously. The data are stored on the
     spacecraft and transmitted to the ground about once a week.

             Drawing of the Photometer Mounted on the Spacecraft

     The spacecraft provides the power, pointing and telemetry for the
     photometer. Pointing at a single group of stars for the entire
     mission greatly increases the photometric stability and simplifies
     the spacecraft design. Other than the gimbaled antenna for
     communications, the small gyroscopes used to maintain the pointing
     and an ejectable cover, there are no other moving or deployable
     parts and there are no liquids to slosh. This enhances the pointing
     stability and the overall reliability of the spacecraft.
