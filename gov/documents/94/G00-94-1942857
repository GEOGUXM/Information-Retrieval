    Astronaut on EVA We'd like you to meet a few of the people behind the
    success of the International Space Station. Now, with the first crew
   moving in this month to live and work on the station, it's a wonderful
                                  reality.

Robert L. Curbeam, Jr. - NASA Astronaut/Commander, U.S. Navy

                                                                                                                   [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]

   Can a man find happiness tethered to the outside of a ship wearing a
   300-pound suit...220 miles up? For Astronaut Robert Curbeam, happiness
   is a spacewalk!

         Kathy Laurini - NASA Coordinator, European Transfer Vehicle

   Take 1 family, add 2 parents (1 American/1 Italian) working on the
   International Space Station, mix in 3 children (all trilingual)...and
   blend everyone into The Netherlands for some real international flavor.
   (Is there a Day Planner for this?) Just all in day's work for Kathy
   Laurini.

               Takayoshi Nishikawa - Astronaut Trainer, Japan

    If astronauts have trainers for Space, who trains the astronaut
    trainers? For Takayoshi Nishikawa, he trains himself but for his own
    adventures on Earth.

    There are currently seven profiles of the people behind the Station.
    Make sure you check out the new additions!
