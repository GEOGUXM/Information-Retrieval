                          Closed School Information
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Proprietary School Certification Program serves as the Missouri
   Department of Higher Education's clearinghouse for information about
   closed Missouri postsecondary schools. We receive many inquiries from,
   or on behalf of, students that attended schools that have since closed,
   and we strive to maintain accurate information regarding where the
   records are stored. Below are some frequently asked questions about
   school closure. If you have other questions, please contact us.

   I can't seem to contact the school I attended. I don't know if it is
   closed but I can't find them listed anywhere. What should I do?

   Contact us by telephone (573-751-2361) or e-mail. While the school
   might be closed, there are a number of other possibilities. Your school
   might have changed its name or location, maybe more than once.
   Sometimes, two schools merge into one and assume a different name.
   Occasionally, a school will close its postsecondary programs but
   continue to operate as a different type of education institution. While
   we may not be able to always find the school you attended, we maintain
   information about these types of changes and often can point you in the
   right direction.

   I need copies of my student records (transcript) from a Missouri school
   that is now closed. How do I get copies of those records?

   Give us a call or e-mail us! While we cannot assure that the records
   are available, we strive to maintain an accurate and up-to-date listing
   of who students must contact in order to get copies of their records.
   Keep in mind, we only have information about schools located in
   Missouri. If you attended a school in another state, you need to
   contact the education agency in that state. We can assist you with
   identifying the best contact person, if you need it.

   In some instances, the Missouri Department of Higher Education has the
   records on site and we can respond directly to your request. If we are
   storing the records, you will need to submit a signed written request
   in order to receive a copy. For others, the records are stored at
   another school within the state. In that case, we can provide you with
   the most up-to-date contact information. Regardless of where your
   records are stored, you will need to know the name of the institution
   you attended, your name at the time of attendance, and the dates you
   attended. In some cases, it may be helpful to have your Social Security
   number and the program of instruction you took.

   Information on Missouri institutions that closed prior to 1985 (that
   is, prior to the creation of the proprietary school certification
   program), is often very limited or nonexistent. In many cases, these
   schools closed without any notification to the Department or to other
   higher education agencies. In such cases, we have no way of knowing how
   or if those records were preserved. We would encourage you to contact
   us, however, just in case we have some information. In addition, we
   would be happy to provide you with written confirmation that the
   records are not available, if we can determine that fact.

   What happens to the student records from schools that close?

   Since 1985, Missouri statutes have required that private career schools
   and other institutions that are approved to operate by this department
   must provide for the permanent storage of the records of students that
   attended the institution. In general, arrangements are made with
   another school to take the records and preserve them. In some cases,
   the Missouri Department of Higher Education has taken possession of the
   records and is serving as the record custodian.

   For higher education institutions that are not subject to those
   requirements, the department attempts to assist with the storage and
   preservation of student records and to serve as a conduit for
   information and assistance to the institution and students.

   I need a copy of my financial aid transcript from a school that is now
   closed. How do I get copies of those records?

   If you attended a school that is now closed and you need a financial
   aid transcript to qualify for federal aid at a school you want to
   attend, the school you wish to attend should send a Financial Aid
   Transcript request form to the following address.

   Federal Request Information Center
   P.O. Box 4129
   Iowa City, Iowa 52244

   You should also write to the Federal Student Aid Information Center at
   the above address if you have additional questions. You should be
   prepared to provide the name and address of the school, the dates you
   attended, your name, and your address and a telephone number where you
   can be reached during the day. You may also call the center at (800)
   433-3243.

   The school I am attending is closing. What should I do?

   Missouri statutes require that schools certified to operate by the
   Missouri Department of Higher Education must provide enrolled students
   with the opportunity to complete their program of instruction (either
   at the closing school or at another school in the area) if they close.
   If such arrangement cannot be made, the school must provide the student
   with a refund.

   Missouri does not have a tuition protection fund that provides for the
   refund of tuition in the case of school closure. As a consequence, the
   school must make any refunds directly to the student.

   If the school you are attending is closing, work closely with school
   officials in order to ensure that you get the benefit of any
   opportunities to complete your training. If you have questions or
   problems or if you need additional information, please contact us.
