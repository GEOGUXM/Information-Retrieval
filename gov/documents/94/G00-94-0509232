Economic Overview

     State capitol: Olympia
     Area: 66,582 square miles
     Population, 2001: 5,974,900
     Labor Force, 2001: 3,094,900

   Washington, also known as the Evergreen State, leads the Pacific
   Northwest region in business vitality. Formerly known for its
   agricultural and forestry products, Washington has developed a highly
   diversified economy since the early 1990s. Expansion in the machinery,
   electronics high technology and biotechnology industries have broadened
   the manufacturing base. At the same time, growth in the service sector
   has reduced the state's sensitivity to cyclical changes in
   manufacturing demand.

   Washington's economy has continued to steadily diversify over the past
   two decades resulting in a healthy climate for business investment, as
   well as creating markets for a wide array of products and services. The
   expansion of the state's manufacturing base and growth in the service
   sector has greatly reduced Washington's sensitivity to cyclical changes
   in manufacturing demand. Since a single industry no longer dominates
   the economy, fluctuations in specific sectors have less dramatic
   effects on the cumulative state economy.

   Washington's economy has experienced major structural changes.
   Employment has declined in traditional industries like agriculture,
   lumber and wood products, and mining, while sharp increases have
   occurred in electronic instruments, machinery, and wholesale and retail
   trade.

Labor Force

   With a labor force of over three million, Washington has an extensive
   supply of skilled and semi-skilled workers. Compared to figures
   nationally, Washington's labor force consistently ranks in the top five
   in terms of education, productivity, and experience. The level of
   education and skills in Washington workers is reflected in the job
   growth rate of high-skilled professions. In the past four years, 40
   percent of this state's job growth has occurred in industries where
   half or more of the workforce is classified as highly skilled. The
   labor force is expected to grow 1.5 percent per year between 2000 and
   2010, while the national labor force growth rate is estimated at 1.1
   percent.

Cost of Living

   Washington has maintained a stable tax structure. Living expenses are
   quite low for grocery items, utilities, transportation, recreational
   activities and most forms of housing. Citizens are well served by
   state, county, and city governments.

Housing Market

   Washington offers affordable housing for all income levels. Newcomers
   experience a variety of choices in housing from rural settings to small
   cities to modern suburbs to large metropolitan areas. Each area offers
   its own unique and interesting residential environment ranging from
   farmhouses and quiet established neighborhoods to modern developments
   and innovative downtown homes.
