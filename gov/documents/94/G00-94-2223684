                             SXI STATUS (2001-12-20)

     GOES 12 and SXI have successfully completed Post-Launch Testing (PLT).
       The spacecraft has been placed in a storage mode as of December 20,
     2001 as a backup to the currently operational GOES spacecraft. GOES 12
     and SXI will become operational when needed as a replacement for either
      GOES 8 or GOES 10. No new SXI data will be available until that time.

        However, there are plans to release FITS format data from the PLT
      period by the summer of 2002, when additional instrument performance
                       analysis will have been completed.


        If you have questions about the SXI archive and this public interface
        please contact Daniel.C.Wilkinson@noaa.gov.

        If you have questions concerning the current status of the instrument,
        image processing, image quality, please contact Steven.Hill@noaa.gov .
