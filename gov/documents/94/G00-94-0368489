   First Time Users
   NTIS makes it easy to find the answers

   Whether you are a research scientist, corporate librarian, or
   government engineer, NTIS can help you today and tomorrow through its
   mission as the central source for U.S. government scientific,
   technical, and business information.

   This growing collection, including millions of publications as well as
   audiovisual materials, computer datafiles, and software, originates
   from U.S. federal agencies, industry and university contractors with
   the federal government, and a worldwide compendium of research and
   development organizations. [Learn more about how NTIS can help you]

   In addition, NTIS acts as a point of entry for key online services
   providing important business information such as export regulations,
   research in progress, and international news. [More about these
   services]

   Coming in early 2002
   When NTIS launches its new web site in early 2002, it will provide
   electronic access to hundreds of thousands of documents. At this time,
   NTIS will provide two options to obtain an electronic version of a
   report.
   [blackbullet.gif] When available, a document summary will link you to
   the full text of the publication that is stored on a government web
   site.
   [blackbullet.gif] When the document is not available from a government
   web site, you can download an electronic version (in PDF format)
   directly from the NTIS web site for $8.95 (Downloads for reports 20
   pages or less are free). Most publications sent to NTIS since 1997 may
   be downloaded in this way.

   Audiovisual, datafiles, and software products cannot be downloaded from
   out web site at this time. They may be ordered online or by mail,
   phone, or fax for shipment to you.

   [pointer_ltblu_11.gif] Order printed copies of products from NTIS
   online or by phone   top of page pointer
   If the full report isn't available electronically, any publication can
   be printed for you. You may order online or by mail, fax, or phone.
