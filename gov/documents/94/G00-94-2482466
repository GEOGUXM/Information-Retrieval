                                 Lidar Jokes
     __________________________________________________________________

   In the style of Jeff Foxworthy redneck jokes, we offer this:
   You know that you work in a lidar group if:
     * You actually get to make a decision about being coherent or
       incoherent.
     * Your co-workers think that a windy or polluted day is a lovely day.
     * You hear the word "DIAL" and you don't think of soap.
     * The term "alignment" has nothing to do with the front end of your
       car.
     * You work in a seatainer that has never been at sea.
     * A trip to the Nevada Test Site in the middle of July is considered
       a perk of the job.
     * You know that Hard Target Returns is not a Jean-Claude Van Damme
       movie sequel.
     * You know the difference between Raman and Ramen.
     * You go on an experiment with a lidar system and then you come back
       and analyze lidar data.
