   In the field of art...artistic expression is a means of communication
   between peoples of diverse national and cultural backgrounds. In an age
   when some of the more prosaic means of communication seem to be
   breaking down in the conflicts of opposing political and ideological
   opinion, artistic expression and communication become more important.
   For the language of the artist transcends political and cultural
   barriers.
   - J. William Fulbright
