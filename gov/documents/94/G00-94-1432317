                          COMMERCIAL CARD  PROGRAM

            FOR DEPARTMENT OF STATE, USAID, USIA, AND PEACE CORPS

   On July 2, 1998, the Procurement Executive issued a task order to
   Citibank under the GSA SmartPay contract for the next generation of
   card technology. The task order encompasses three business lines:
   purchase, travel, and fleet. This page will be your Table of Contents
   for Policy and Operational guidance as well as other related Resources
   for use by both domestic acquisition activities and overseas posts.
   The new worldwide Purchase Card program with Citibank as the
   Department's  card provider, became effective November 30, 1998.  The
   term "I.M.P.A.C. referred to the previous U.S. Bank Purchase Card and
   is no longer applicable.  The term "SmartPay" will now be used to refer
   to the new Government wide Purchase Card.   We will be posting
   information and links on this page as they become available.
