   Yard and Garden Topics

   Bee illustration Be a King County Yardener! Yardening is gardening to
   protect you, your family and the environment by using fewer chemicals
   and less water. Increase the natural elements: good bugs, soil
   amendments, and native plants, and you can have a healthy and beautiful
   'yarden.'
   Composter illustration

   Soil - It's Alive!
   Healthy soil has over 4 billion organisms per teaspoon! Good soil grows
   healthy plants without chemicals - better for your family, fish and the
   environment. Improve your soil by adding compost to increase its
   organic content. For compost and composting information call King
   County at 206-296-4466, or see compost basics.

   The easy path to Natural Lawn Care
   Save time and money on chemicals and watering!

    1. Grasscycle: Mow high, mow often and leave clippings to help
       fertilize your lawn. Grasscycling can provide almost Â¼ of your
       lawn's fertilizer needs.
    2. Fertilize moderately in September and May with natural organic or
       slow release fertilizers or compost.
    3. Water your lawn deeply but less often to grow hardy, deep roots. A
       weekly sprinkling of about an inch of water in the morning or
       evening is best.
    4. Improve lawns with aeration, overseeding, or compost. Or consider
       rebuilding the soil and replanting.
    5. Protect your kids and pets by using bug and weed killers sparingly,
       if at all. Lawn chemicals can be tracked into your house or rubbed
       off onto toys and skin.
    6. On steep slopes, in shady areas and near lakes, ponds, and streams
       replace lawns with native plants that can thrive in those tricky
       spots. The right plants will help slow the runoff of rain, soil and
       chemicals, and provide you with a beautiful Northwest look.

   For a copy of "Natural Lawn Care for Western Washington" call
   1-888-860-LAWN. For more on lawn care check out these web sites:

   Using native plants is far more than just another way to make your
   garden look pretty - it actually has the potential to change the world
   for the better. And how many things can you say that about these days?
   - Sally Wasowski, Requiem for a Lawnmower
   ...there is a growing feeling that we want not only to preserve our
   treasures of water and wilderness but to make gardens that respect and
   refer to them as well. - Ann Lovejoy, Cascadia
