                                ICR Overview

   Ion cyclotron resonance was not included in the original mission and
   funding of the NHMFL. An ICR program was initiated in 1993 from State
   of Florida funds, with the hiring of Alan G. Marshall (Director of the
   ICR Program) and Shenheng Guan (Associate Director). In 1994, Marshall
   and Guan co-authored successful NSF and NIH competing renewal
   proposals. These two investigators also combined with UF's John R.
   Eyler in a recently funded ($5 million over five years) NSF High-Field
   Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry Facility
   designed to develop and provide state-of-the-art FT-ICR capabilities to
   external users (university, government, and industrial labs)
   nationwide. Full details on the scope and administrative structure of
   that facility are available on request. Here, we confine our attention
   to NHMFL's (critical) role in providing the high-field magnets that
   will make possible the highest-performance FT-ICR experiments in the
   world.

   Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) already provides the
   most versatile and highest-performance mass analysis: e.g., mass
   resolving power of 1,000,000 for protein ions up to 30,000 Da, and
   detection of a single (multiply-charged) ion up to 108 Da;
   determination of ion-molecule reaction pathways, kinetics, equilibria,
   energetics, and mechanism by manipulation of mass-selected trapped
   ions; mixture analysis; surface analysis; high sensitivity (e.g.,
   femtomole detection of peptides and phospholipids); speed (typically 1
   second for a full mass spectrum); etc. About 160 FT-ICR systems have
   been built or bought worldwide, and more than 30 reviews dealing
   exclusively with FT-ICR have appeared in the past five years alone.

   As in FT-NMR spectroscopy, resolving power in FT-ICR mass spectrometry
   scales linearly with magnetic field, B0. Thus, the magnets available to
   NHMFL's ICR Facility [9.4 T (supercon), 20 T (supercon), and 25 T
   (resistive)] project improvement in ICR mass resolving power by factors
   of 34% to 357% compared to the largest-field (7 T) ICR magnets anywhere
   else. Moreover, a higher magnetic field offers a host of additional
   advantages for FT-ICR, as outlined briefly in Table -1. Apart from
   obvious major improvements in mass resolving power and upper mass limit
   (which scale as B0 and B02), the higher magnetic field also greatly
   reduces the rate of ion loss by radial diffusion (which scales as
   B0-2), and thus improves all FT-ICR experiments because ions remain
   confined to the center of the trap. Finally, various non-linearities
   are greatly reduced at higher magnetic field: e.g., unwanted
   coalescence of closely-spaced peaks scales as Bo-2.
