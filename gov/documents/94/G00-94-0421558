   River Information by Phone

   For the benefit of fishermen and other recreational users of TVAs
   reservoirs, we offer a 24-hour automated service providing information
   on reservoir levels, predicted reservoir levels, tributary flows, and
   expected water releases from our dams.

   Numbers to call
   To use this service with a push-button phone, call one of these
   numbers:

     * Knoxville, Tennessee: 865-632-2264
     * Chattanooga, Tennessee: 423-751-2264
     * Muscle Shoals, Alabama: 256-386-2264
     * Elsewhere in the Tennessee Valley: 800-238-2264 (toll-free)
     * TDD: 800-438-2264

   An automated recording will help guide you to the information you need.

   If you need more information or have problems accessing the data,
   please call 865-632-6065 Monday through Friday between 8:30 a.m. and
   4:30 p.m. Eastern time.

   System instructions
   After dialing, you will hear a menu of selections.

     * If you want to know a reservoirs current water level, press 1 and
       then enter the two-digit code for the reservoir (see table below).
       For example, if you want to know the current water level at Norris,
       press 1 and then 17 (the code for Norris).
       This information is updated periodically throughout the day.
     * If you are interested in predicted reservoir levels, press 2 and
       then enter the two-digit code for the reservoir (see table below).
       This information is updated daily at 1 p.m. Eastern time.
     * If you need information about flows of water in unregulated streams
       (in cubic feet per second), press 3.
       This information is updated every two hours between 5 a.m. and 9
       p.m. Eastern time.
       After you have heard the gauge reading you want (see table below),
       press * to return to the main menu.
     * If you want to know when water will be released from TVA and U.S.
       Corps of Engineers dams, press 4 and then enter the two-digit code
       for the dam (see table below).

   Each day at about 6 p.m. Eastern time, discharges at a particular dam
   are predicted through midnight of the next day. Actual discharges for
   the past eight hours are given first. Press # to skip the
   actual-discharge readings and go directly to the predicted ones.

   If spilling is reported, predicted discharge is not given. The total
   discharge is the sum of water discharged at all available generating
   units plus the spillway discharge.

   Note: You may go directly to the information you want without listening
   to all the instructions. For example, if you want the Norris
   water-release schedule, press 4 as soon as you hear Welcome. Then,
   after a slight pause, press 17 for Norris, pause, and press # to skip
   the information on observed discharges. Youll hear the latest
   water-release schedule.

   You may press the * key to return to the main menu or the 9 key to exit
   from the system without hearing the entire report.
