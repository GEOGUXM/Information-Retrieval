   Aluminum Vision Revised!

   OIT's partner, The Aluminum Association, recently published the
   Aluminum Industry Vision:  Sustainable Solutions For A Dynamic World
   document.  The document presents the first update to the aluminum
   industry vision, Partnerships for the Future, published in 1996.  The
   vision incorporates sections discussing:
     * The Aluminum Industry Today
     * Future Trends
     * Vision of the Aluminum Industry
     * Implementation Strategy

   The original vision, Partnerships for the Future, set the framework for
   the industry's first technology roadmap, and for the past fiive years
   has been instrumental in advancing aluminum research and development.
   The aluminum visions were implemented to stimulate a wide variety of
   R&D activities intended to accelerate technology development throughout
   the industry.

   While industry is responsible for developing such documents like the
   aluminum vision, OIT facilitates the process.  OIT brings together the
   diverse sectors of an industry and assists them in creating a common
   strategic vision for the future 20 years from now.
