       These pages provide access to water-resources data collected at
      approximately 1.5 million sites in all 50 States, the District of
     Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Online access to this data is organized

   The USGS investigates the occurrence, quantity, quality, distribution,
     and movement of surface and underground waters and disseminates the
     data to the public, State and local governments, public and private
   utilities, and other Federal agencies involved with managing our water
                                 resources.
