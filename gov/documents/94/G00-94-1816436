                              Fusion Materials

                         A Critical Issue for Fusion

   New, this page is under development, January 27, 2002

   We will be collecting information of relevance to the development of
   materials needed for fusion energy. Please send suggestions to
   dmeade@pppl.gov or Steve Zinkle at zinklesj@ornl.gov.

  The Multi-Machine Strategy

   The Secretary of Energy Advisory Board(SEAB) Task Force on Fusion
   Energy review of the U. S. fusion program noted that "A necessary next
   major scientific step is the exploration of the physics of a burning
   plasma. At the present time only the tokamak is sufficiently advanced
   as to assure the necessary confinement in such an experiment." The
   National Research Council Assessment of Fusion Science(FuSAC) Interim
   Report identified several critical unresolved fusion science issues:
   (1) turbulence and transport, (2) energy density limits and (3)
   integrated physics of self-heated plasmas. The goal of FIRE is to
   address the critical scientific issues of a magnetically confined
   fusion plasma identified by SEAB and FuSAC within the next decade using
   the most cost-effective approach. Success in FIRE would serve as a
   "Stepping Stone" to provide the scientific foundation needed for an
   attractive fusion energy source as envisioned by the Advanced Reactor
   Innovation Evaluation Study (ARIES) .
