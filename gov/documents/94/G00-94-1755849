Neutrino Measurement Surprises Fermilab Physicists

Scientists at the Department of Energy's Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory have found a surprising discrepancy between predictions for the
behavior of neutrinos and the way the subatomic particles actually behave.

   January 28Experimenters at Fermilab's NuTeV (Neutrinos at the
   Tevatron) experiment measured the ratio of two types of
   particlesneutrinos and muonsemerging from high-energy collisions of
   neutrinos with target nuclei.

   The results of generations of particle experiments with other particles
   have yielded precise predictions for the value of this ratio, which
   characterizes the interactions of particles with the weak force, one of
   the four fundamental forces of nature. For other elementary particles,
   including the quarks and electrons of ordinary matter, the predictions
   seem to hold true.

Disorderly Superconductors Caught in the Act

Atom by atom, researchers at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory track down granularity in a high-temperature
superconductor, as reported in the 24 January issue of Nature.

   January 28, 2002The "granular" nature of superconductivity in
   underdoped high-temperature superconductors proposed by theorists has
   had some believers but many skeptics. New observations, reported in the
   24 January issue of Nature, may shift how researchers think about these
   materials.

   Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University
   of California at Berkeley have used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
   to make the first-ever nanometer-scale maps of "granular"
   superconductivity in a high-temperature superconductor.
