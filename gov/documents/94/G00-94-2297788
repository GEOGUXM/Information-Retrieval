      The Cornell and CONTOUR Comet Challenge
      1/25/02

      An Opportunity for Teachers and Students to Participate in the Launch
      of NASA's CONTOUR Spacecraft from Cape Canaveral, Florida

      Cornell University and the Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR) mission team
      invite teachers and students to participate in the CONTOUR launch
      activities at Cape Canaveral, Florida, in July of 2002, by developing a
      plan to share their excitement and experiences with their community.
      CONTOUR is a NASA Discovery mission that will launch in July 2002 to
      study comets in unprecedented detail. U.S. students in grades 5 through
      12 and their teachers are eligible to participate. All proposals must
      be received by March 31, 2002.

      This program is a unique and exciting opportunity for student and
      teacher teams to work with and learn from CONTOUR scientists and
      engineers and to experience the thrill of witnessing an actual rocket
      launch. This is a particularly exciting opportunity for students and
      teachers interested in science and education. During the days prior to
      the launch, the teams will have one-on-one interactions with the
      CONTOUR scientists, take part in a variety of educational events on the
      study of comets and the CONTOUR mission, tour the Kennedy Space Center,
      and attend a VIP briefing with the CONTOUR engineers and scientists.
      These activities will culminate with a spectacular viewing of the
      launch of the spacecraft from Cape Canaveral*. After participating in
      the launch activities, participants will follow through with their plan
      to share their experience with other students and community members. To
      learn more about this opportunity, please visit the web site at
      http://www.contour2002.org.

      *Launch delays can occur for a variety of technical or weather-related
      reasons. If the launch is delayed by one or two days, the trip will be
      extended to allow participation. If the launch is delayed by three or
      more days, the opportunity for participation will, unfortunately, be
      forfeited.

      Stardust On Course for Comet Wild 2
      1/23/02

      Stardust successfully completed a critical deep space maneuver,
      positioning itself on a course to encounter comet Wild 2 in January
      2004 and collect dust from the comet.

      At 21:56 Universal Time (1:56 p.m. Pacific Time), January 18, Stardust
      fired its thrusters for nearly 111 seconds, increasing the speed of the
      spacecraft by 2.65 meters per second (about 6 miles per hour).

      "This is the maneuver that sets us up for the bigger maneuver. It's a
      combination of increasing the speed of the spacecraft and at the same
      time putting it on the path to reach Wild 2," said Robert Ryan,
      Stardust's mission manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "It's like
      the setup pass in a basketball game. Now we're ready to shoot the
      basket."

      The spacecraft responded exactly as planned, said Ryan, although
      communication was tricky. Stardust is currently the farthest
      solar-powered object from the Sun, over 395 million kilometers (245
      million miles) away. The spacecraft's signal confirming it had
      completed the maneuver took almost 30 minutes to reach Earth.

      In January 2004, Stardust will fly through the halo of dust that
      surrounds the nucleus of comet Wild 2. The spacecraft will return to
      Earth in January 2006 to make a soft landing at the U.S. Air Force Utah
      Test and Training Range. Its sample return capsule, holding microscopic
      particles of comet and interstellar dust, will be taken to the
      planetary material curatorial facility at NASA's Johnson Space Center,
      Houston, Texas, where the samples will be carefully stored and
      examined.

      Stardust's cometary and interstellar dust samples will help provide
      answers to fundamental questions about the origins of the solar system.

      CONTOUR SPACECRAFT NEARS COMPLETION
      1/4/02

      After nearly two years of detailed development and assembly, engineers
      at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in
      Laurel, Maryland, are putting the last touches on the Comet Nucleus
      Tour (CONTOUR) spacecraft, which will provide the closest and most
      detailed look ever into a comet.

      Slated to launch July 1, 2002, CONTOUR will encounter at least two
      diverse comets as they zip through the inner solar system. From as
      close as 100 miles (160 kilometers), the spacecraft will snap
      high-resolution photos of the comet nucleus, map the types of rock and
      ice on the nucleus, and analyze the composition of the surrounding gas
      and dust. CONTOUR's targets include comet Encke in November 2003 and
      Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 in June 2006, though if an opportunity arises,
      the mission team can send the spacecraft to an as-yet undiscovered
      comet.

      Currently in an APL clean room, CONTOUR has had all its onboard systems
      tested, including four scientific instruments, two cameras, a dust
      analyzer and a mass spectrometer. Over the next week, APL technicians
      will attach solar panels and the final layers of the dust shield which
      is designed to protect CONTOUR from bullet-like particles around the
      comets.

      Environmental testing on the craft begins January 14 on APL's large
      vibration tables. On January 28, CONTOUR will ship to NASA's Goddard
      Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, for nearly three months of
      additional tests in Goddard's expansive facilities. In May, CONTOUR
      will leave Goddard for Kennedy Space Center, Florida, in final
      preparation for launch aboard a Boeing Delta II rocket.
