    If you have problems with this newer search engine, please look here.
                     You can also use the older engine.

     * Search results may contain one or more of the words entered in the
       query box (Boolean "OR"). Documents with the most matches to the
       query words are listed before documents with fewer matches
       (example: crib infant). If a match must contain all words, use
       "AND" between the words (example: crib AND infant). To search for a
       phrase only, use quotation marks around the words (example: "infant
       crib").
     * Searches will find documents themselves and may also find menu
       pages containing links to them. If you choose a menu page from your
       search results and wish to investigate it more, you can use the
       "find in page" feature of your browser to look for a search term.
       If you don't want menu pages in your search, they can be excluded
       by using a trick. For example, to find all documents with the word
       "halogen", put that word in the search box. To exclude menu pages
       with links to these documents, put the following in the search box:
       halogen -imagelink: banner5.gif - since just about all menu pages
       (including this page) have the banner5 graphic at the top, this
       will exclude them.
     * There is a lot more you can do to tailor your search and there is
       also an advanced search capability.
