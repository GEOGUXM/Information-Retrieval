   Achieving Results for the WorldÂ’s Families

      The U.S. Agency for International Developments programs in global
      health represent the commitment and determination of the U.S.
      government to prevent suffering, save lives, and create a brighter
      future for families in the developing world.
      USAID is confronting global health challenges through improving the
      quality, availability, and use of essential health and family planning
      services. The combination of on-the-ground experience in developing
      countries and global research on innovative technologies and approaches
      has given USAID a unique advantage in designing effective programs.
      USAID's strategy for global health seeks to stabilize world population
      and protect human health through programs in maternal and child health,
      HIV/AIDS, family planning and reproductive health, infectious diseases,
      environmental health, nutrition and other life-saving areas.
      Over the last 40 years, USAID has demonstrated a strong record of
      achieving positive results in the health arena.
        * Deaths among children under five have declined from 15 million a
          year in 1980 to 11 million in 2000.
        * Only 2,400 polio cases were reported in 2000, compared to
          approximately 350,000 per year in the 1980s.
        * The use of oral rehydration therapy has reduced child deaths from
          diarrheal disease from 4.6 million in 1980 to 1.5 million in 1999.
          Since 1965, the percentage of couples in developing countries using
          contraception has risen from 10% to more than 50%, and the average
          number of children born to couples worldwide has dropped by a
          third.
        * More than 50 million couples in the developing world use family
          planning as a direct result of USAID assistance. These families are
          better able to feed, clothe, educate, and provide healthcare for
          their children.

      Global health issues have global consequences that not only affect the
      people of developing nations but also directly affect the interests of
      American citizens. USAID programs not only reduce deaths and
      disabilities, but also help establish sustainable health systems that
      will help developing countries confront new challenges and meet the
   future needs of their people.
