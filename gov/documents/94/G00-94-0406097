                              Newcastle Disease
            _____________________________________________________

   The 1971 exotic Newcastle disease (ND) in Southern California was
   traced to [jacks.jpg] the importation and release of exotic pet birds
   in that area. Control of that devastating outbreak cost over $56
   million in Federal funds. Virulent forms of ND virus have been
   eradicated from poultry, but are routinely recovered from illegally
   imported pet birds and from migratory water-birds, particularly the
   cormorant. These sources of virulent virus are a continuing hazard to
   the poultry industry. Research efforts have resulted in improved
   vaccines, diagnostic tests, and more recently, rapid nucleotide
   sequence analysis of the virus genome. Current goals are to devise
   molecular-based tests for distinguishing virulent strains from low
   virulence domestic strains of NDV, to identify phylogenetic
   relationships among circulating strains and to achieve a better
   understanding of the molecular basis of its disease-causing ability.
