                        NREL's Solid State Theory Group:
                                  An Overview

   The Solid State Theory (SST) Group at NREL was established in 1978
   under the direction of Alex Zunger. The group consists of four regular
   staff plus anywhere from five to eight post docs, research associates
   and visiting scientists. This group has hosted and trained 31 post
   doctoral fellows (visit our web page entitled "Where Are They Now?")
   and published over 300 papers in refereed journals (search our
   publications at our web page entitled "Publications by Subject")
   including more than 40 in Physical Review Letters and almost 50 in
   Rapid Communications, and delivered over 80 invited talks at major
   conferences around the world (including 7 at APS March Meetings). The
   SST Group's main areas of research include (but are not limited to):
     * Theory of Photovoltaic Semiconductors
     * Statistical & Electronic Theory of Metal and Semiconductor Alloys
     * Semiconductor Nanostructures
     * Computational Methods in First-Principles Theories

   Sources of Funding include (see "Sources of Funding"):
     * DOE, Office of Energy Efficiency
     * DOE, Office of Science, Division of Materials Science

   Computer facilities include a sixteen processor SGI Origin 2000,
   several IBM and SUN UNIX workstations, and access to NERSC Cray T3E and
   IBM SP (the world's fastest fastest unclassified computer).
