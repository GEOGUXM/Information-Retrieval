   SEC Issues Statement on Disclosure Requirements for Public Companies

      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
      2002-13

      Washington, D.C., January 22, 2002 Â— The Securities and Exchange
      Commission today issued a statement setting forth certain of its views
      regarding disclosure that should be considered by public companies
      while preparing annual reports for the year recently ended. The
      statement is posted on the Commission's web page www.sec.gov under
      Regulatory Actions, Other Commission Orders, Notices, and Information.

      The Commission's statement reminds public companies of existing
      disclosure requirements and suggests steps companies, domestic and
      foreign, should consider in meeting those requirements, regarding:
        * liquidity and capital resources, including off-balance sheet
          arrangements,

        * certain trading activities that include non-exchange traded
          contracts accounted for at fair value, and

        * effects of transactions with related and certain other parties.

      "We need better disclosure about these matters in this reporting
      season," said SEC Chief Accountant Robert K. Herdman. "While existing
      rules mandate explanations of material uncertainties, our hope is that
      public companies will go beyond the minimum legal requirements and
      serve investors with the very best possible discussion of the company's
      financial position and operating results. The Commission will continue
      to study how it can bring about further improvements in disclosure
      concerning critical accounting policies, important assumptions
      underlying reported results and material off-balance sheet activities,
      among other topics."

      The Commission's statement refers to recommendations contained in a
      petition for interpretive guidance from the five largest accounting
      firms, which was endorsed by the American Institute of Certified Public
      Accountants. That petition is posted on the Commission's web page
      www.sec.gov under Regulatory Actions, Petitions for Rulemaking.

      The statement does not create new legal requirements, or modify
      existing legal requirements. The Commission also is considering whether
      to propose rules in the future to improve the consistency and
      completeness of disclosure about the particular risks, relationships
      and activities addressed in the petition and this statement.
