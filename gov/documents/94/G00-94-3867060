   Our Mission

      Provide measurement techniques, standards, basic data, and predictive
      models needed by U.S. industry for reliable and cost-effective
      manufacturing of ceramics.

   What We Do

      We focus on process measurements for the ceramic manufacturing
      industry, including the characterization of ceramic powders and
      suspensions, and measurements for shape forming, sintering,
      densification, and machining. We investigate the influence of powder
      characteristics and processing conditions on ceramic properties, and we
      characterize machining induced damage and the influence of this damage
      on mechanical properties. We develop standard reference materials,
      standard test methods, nomenclature, and guides-to-practice related to
      these measurement applications.
