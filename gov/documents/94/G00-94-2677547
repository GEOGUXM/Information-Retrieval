   he next decade will be an exciting time for planetary scientists as
   NASA conducts the first sample return mission since the Apollo lunar
   program. We will collect samples of solar wind (Genesis), a comet and
   interplanetary dust (Stardust) and collaborate on a Japanese mission to
   sample an asteroid (Muses-C). We will soon thereafter return samples of
   rock and soil from Mars.

   The JSC Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Team is actively
   participating in these missions and has built an Advanced Curation
   Laboratory in which to design and test equipment and procedures to
   handle these new samples returned from space.
