About Metrolink

   During the late 1980's, several agencies conducted studies and
   developed plans for commuter rail transportation in the Southern
   California region. These efforts gained momentum with the passage of
   local sales tax measures for transportation in Riverside and San
   Bernardino counties, and in 1990, in Los Angeles and Orange counties.

   Older Metrolink engine The end result of this planning is Metrolink.
   Metrolink is a premier regional rail system, including commuter and
   other passenger services, linking communities to employment and
   activity centers. Metrolink provides reliable transportation and
   mobility for the region, leading toward more livable communities.

Special Trains

   Metrolink is not just for commuters. In September 1995, the first
   regularly scheduled Saturday service, the San Bernardino Line's
   Saturday Explorer Trains, began operations. The Explorers not only
   carry people heading to and from work, but also families on
   recreational trips, shoppers, and a surprising number of people just
   riding for fun.

   There are also special Metrolink service and charters trains for
   special trips and events such as special Inland Empire to San Clemente
   Beach Trains that carry thousands to the beaches of San Clemente and
   shopping destinations at San Juan Capistrano.

   Here are the special trains currently running:
