              They're Here, They're There, They're Everywhere !
                    Gamma Ray Bursts ! (A Double Feature)

    Gamma Ray bursts are the most powerful explosions which take place in
    the universe. They were first discovered in the late 1960's. For many
     years scientists puzzled over how far away they are and what causes
       them. The BATSE instrument on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory
        observes these bursts about once a day, uniformly distributed
   throughout the sky. This suggested that the bursts occur very far away,
                    but how far still remained a mystery.

          In 1997, the Beppo-SAX satellite, along with ground based
   observatories, made the discoveries which transformed our understanding
       of these brilliant flashes of gamma rays. Beppo-Sax employed a
    technique using a special aperture mask to determine the location of
       the bursts. The first video of our double feature explains what
                         scientists then discovered.

    What causes these intense bursts of gamma rays ? Two theories are now
    being debated among scientists - hypernova and merging neutron stars.
                 The second video describes these theories.
