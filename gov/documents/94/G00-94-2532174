Welcome

   Welcome to the home page of the National Genetic Resouces Advisory
   Council. The following sections provide you, the public, with a record
   of the USDA's efforts to respond to the important issues of the nation
   in respect to conserving and utilizing genetic resources for food and
   agriculture. The minutes of the meetings are provided below and
   encompass discussions and recommendations on plants, animals and
   microbials. Forestry, insects and aquatic genetic resources are
   encompassed in those categories.

Authority

   The National Genetic Resources Advisory Council (NGRAC) for the
   National Genetic Resources Program (NGRP) was established in March,
   1992, under the USDA Departmental Regulation 1043-8 as directed by
   Section 1632 of P.L. 101-624.

Purpose

   The NGRAC advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary and
   Director of the NGRP.

Membership

   The NGRAC can consist of up to nine members appointed by the Secretary
   and seven or more ex-officio members. Two-thirds of the appointed
   members represent the scientific disciplines relevant to NGRP, and
   one-third represent the general public in relevant activities. Thus, it
   is likely that each of the life forms in NGRP (plants, forest species,
   animals, aquatics, insects, and microbes) are represented by only one
   appointed scientific member.
