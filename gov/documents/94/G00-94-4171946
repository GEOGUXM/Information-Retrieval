   About FedForms

     On December 17, 1999, the President issued a memorandum to the heads
     of Federal departments And agencies on helping citizens gain
     one-stop access to existing government information and services, and
     to provide better, more efficient, government services and increased
     government accountability to its citizens.

     FedForms is one component of this effort. It contains forms needed
     for the top 500 Government services used by the public. FedForms
     does not contain instructions or program descriptions. These must be
     obtained from the appropriate agency web site.

     FedForms is a work in progress and not a static site. The
     enhancements planned to make the site more useful and easier to use
     are:
     * Agencies will be adding forms to the database as they continue to
       identify forms needed for the top 500 Government services and as
       they add forms to the Internet.

     * We will develop additional search features that will identify and
       organize information by types of services so that it will be easier
       for the public to find the information it seeks.

     * By October 2003, where appropriate, the forms will provide for
       online processing of transactions.
