                                  Option #1

   This is metallic gold, which is similar to the gold color the bridge is
    now painted. Gold carries a special significance for local residents.
     We live in "The Golden State," and we are connected by history and
               geography to California's scenic "Gold Country"

   Option #2

   In this option, the body of the bridge is painted forest green and the
     towers are silver and gold. The color green is widespread along the
   Sacramento River waterfront and in several downtown buildings, such as
     Raley Field. This combination of colors is designed to enhance the
      bridge's appearance so it will blend in harmony with the natural
                     landscape and the downtown skyline.

   Option #3

    This choice shows the body of the bridge painted burgundy, with gold
    and silver towers. The popular paddle-wheeled riverboats and many of
       the buildings in Old Sacramento near the bridge have shades of
    reddish-brown, burgundy, and rust in them. Burgundy and gold are also
   prominent colors of the Sacramento Rivercats baseball team, who play at
                 Raley Field, just west of the Tower Bridge.
