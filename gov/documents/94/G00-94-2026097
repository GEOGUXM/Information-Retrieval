   Office of Plans and Policy

   The Office of Plans and Policy assists, advises, and makes
   recommendations to the Commission with respect to the development and
   implementation of communications policies in all areas of Commission
   authority and responsibility, particularly those that cross traditional
   industry and institutional boundaries.

   The Office is composed of a small group of multidisciplinary staff
   members, including economists, engineers, attorneys, MBAs, and social
   scientists. OPP is particularly active in assisting the Commission in
   ensuring that broadband services are deployed and accessible to all
   Americans.

   A principal function of the Office is to conduct independent economic
   and policy analyses of programs and responsibilities of other bureaus
   and offices and to recommend appropriate Commission action. OPP staff
   work to assess the long term effects of alternative Commission policies
   on domestic and international communications industries and services.
   These analyses often take the form of working papers or staff reports.

   The Office is also responsible for evaluating governmental, academic
   and industry sponsored research affecting Commission policy issues.

   OPP, working together with other Bureaus and Offices, is also
   responsible for assessing the Commission processes and recommending
   changes in Commission structure and process to be more compatible with
   changing technological and market conditions. A key initiative was the
   development of a five-year Strategic Plan for the Commission to better
   reflect the changing nature of the communications sector given the
   dramatic changes in technology, markets, and competition over the past
   decade. OPP works with the other Bureau and Office to help implement
   and track the agency's progress in accomplishing the goals of the Plan.
