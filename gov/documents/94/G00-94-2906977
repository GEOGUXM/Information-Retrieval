                  GSFC and UW Rain Estimates During KWAJEX
     __________________________________________________________________

   The TRMM Office at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center has taken the
   initiative to compare rainfall estimates over Kwajalein, Republic of
   the Marshall Islands (RMI), being independently made by groups at
   NASA/GSFC and the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University
   of Washington. The purpose of this research is not to determine which
   set of estimates are correct or incorrect, but rather to detail what
   differences, if any, are evident between the two data sets.

   For purposes of this research, August 1999 was selected as the data
   study period. This period covers the mid-portion of the KWajalein
   EXperiment (KWAJEX). The input data consists of NASA/GSFC 2A53 and
   University of Washington 2A-53uw rainfall estimates on a 2 km x 2 km
   grid, extending 150 km from the Kwajalein radar (KR). These data and
   others are available from the NASA GSFC DAAC.
