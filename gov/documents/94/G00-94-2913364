   So you want to be a mairne biologist

   For those interested in the oceans of the world and the living
   creatures that call them home, the career of a marine biologist can
   seem like a dream come true. What could be better than spending you
   time using SCUBA and submarines to explore the world's oceans,
   catalogue new types of life, and trying to find answers to the problem
   facing our oceans today. The rewards are many, but not every day is
   filled with exciting exploration and hours under water. There is much
   behind the scenes work, which does not rise into the spotlight, that
   makes those days in the water possible and productive. The job of a
   marine biologist requires dedication, patience, and a strong background
   in science, math, chemistry, and other disciplines.

   To learn more about opportunities in the marine science field, check
   out the list of links below as well as the links to both Florida Keys
   National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) and non-FKNMS positions.
