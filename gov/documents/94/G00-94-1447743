landlords

   People who receive Section 8 vouchers go find their own rental housing
   and use the vouchers they receive from their housing agency to help pay
   the rent. Basically, the voucher means that the Federal Government will
   pay a specific amount of the rent. If you own a home that you would
   like to rent to Section 8 tenants, contact your local public housing
   agency to find out how. Here is additional information that may help
   you.
