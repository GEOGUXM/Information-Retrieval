  Unconsolidated Aquifers of Upstate New York
     __________________________________________________________________

   The most productive aquifers in upstate New York consist of
   unconsolidated deposits of sand and gravel that occupy major river and
   stream valleys or lake plains and terraces. Ground water in these
   aquifers occurs under water-table (unconfined) or artesian (confined)
   conditions. Municipalities, industries, and farms have been built over
   many of these aquifers because they typically form flat areas that are
   suitable for development and generally provide an ample ground-water
   supply. This development, coupled with the high permeability of these
   deposits and shallow depth to the water table, makes these aquifers
   particularly susceptible to contamination from point sources such as
   landfills and petroleum storage and nonpoint sources such as urban and
   agricultural runoff.

   To enhance and promote proper development, management, and protection
   of the unconsolidated aquifers of upstate New York, the United States
   Geological Survey has completed hydrogeologic mapping projects in
   cooperation with New York State and local agencies. The distribution
   and hydrogeologic characteristics of the unconsolidated aquifers are
   presented at the 1:250,000 scale in a series of five maps that were
   published in 1988 in cooperation with the New York State Department of
   Environmental Conservation. More detailed hydrogeologic maps are
   available for selected aquifers at the 1:24,000 scale. Since 1980, 29
   of these aquifer maps have been published in cooperation with the New
   York State Department of Environmental Conservation and Health and
   various local agencies. The aquifer maps generally include a series of
   1:24,000 maps showing aquifer boundaries, surficial geology, location
   of wells and test holes, and the water-table or potentiometric surface.
