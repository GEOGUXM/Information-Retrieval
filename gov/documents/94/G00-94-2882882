   FACNET/EDI CAPABILITIES

    The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 mandated that
   procurement activities begin using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).
   EDI is an automated computer-to-computer exchange of structured
   business documents such as requests for quotations, offers, purchase
   orders, delivery orders, payment and other contractual documents.

   The Division of Acquisition Management has the capability to
   electronically advertise our simplified acquisitions on the Federal
   Acquisition Computer Network (FACNET). We use FACNET to electronically
   process many simplified acquisition requests. These requests can be
   processed on the open market for orders up to $100,000. For GSA
   Schedule delivery orders there are no maximum order limitations.

   Some benefits of processing requirements with EDI are reductions in
   paperwork, reduced processing time, a less expensive way of doing
   business, convenient exchange of business documents during business and
   non-business hours, competitive pricing from a large vendor audience,
   and improved customer service.

   For information concerning our Division's FACNET and EDI capability,
   please contact
   Ms. Maggie Pippin on (301) 443-7075, email: mpippin@psc.gov  .


   TEMPORARY HIRES

   The Division of Acquisition Management can provide your office with
   private sector temporary services. We have agreements with several
   temporary companies that can provide many different services such as

   accountants. The Federal Regulations allow agencies to have temporary
   services for 120 workdays per order.

   To request a private sector temporary, simply prepare an
   HHS 393 in the usual manner with the required signatures and approvals.
   Private sector requests need an additional approval from your personnel
   office. On an attached sheet, outline the duties/skills required,
   report time and other abilities required. If needed, we can provide you
   with this outline. If you need additional information regarding
