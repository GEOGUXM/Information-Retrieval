                                Audit Summary
                             State of Washington
                     July 1, 1999 through June 30, 2000

   ABOUT THE AUDIT

   This special report represents the results of our audit of the state’s
   contracting practices during the period July 1, 1999 through June 30,
   2000. We included in the audit amounts that accounted for 81 percent of
   state contracting expenditures for selected types of architecture and
   engineering, construction, and purchased and personal services. We
   performed procedures related to contract procurement, monitoring and
   payment at 23 agencies and institutions of higher education. The audit
   included a review of the accounting records and other procedures we
   considered necessary.

   RESULTS

   We found state agencies and institutions we examined have established
   adequate contract procurement, monitoring and payment controls. In
   addition, state agencies and institutions are complying with applicable
   state laws and regulations.

   We identified some specific agency practices that appear especially
   effective in safeguarding state assets and ensuring legal compliance.
   We also described several issues for the Legislature’s consideration
   regarding the strengthening of laws and regulations related to the
   safeguarding of state assets.

                         Audit Overview and Results
                             State of Washington
                     July 1, 1999 through June 30, 2000

   BASIS FOR AUDIT

   The Washington State Auditor’s Office is authorized by state law (RCW
   43.88.160 (6)) to:
    1. Review each state agency’s system of internal controls.
    2. Audit the financial transactions of each agency.
    3. Determine whether agencies, in making expenditures, have complied
       with state laws.
    4. Report results and make recommendations to the Legislature.

   Among the items we audit are the contracts between state agencies and
   contractors who provide services ranging from construction to training
   to client services. As an example of the extent of state contracting,
   the Department of Social and Health Services estimates that more than
   two-thirds of its fiscal year 1999 $6 billion budget (or $11 million a
   day) was paid for all types of contracted services.

   Some types of contracting, such as architecture/engineering and
   construction contracts, have few state procurement requirements and are
   regulated to some degree only by the procedures agencies establish.
   Others, such as purchased and personal services contracts, are
   generally governed by detailed state laws and regulations for
   procurement. Currently, there are no procurement or monitoring
   requirements for client services contracts, a type of personal services
   contract. These contracts recently were the subject of study by a task
   force mandated by the Legislature to determine what regulations were
   needed. Another type of contracting, grants of federal and state money
   to carry out program goals, also falls under few state procurement
   requirements. Excluding contracts for client services and grants,
   statewide expenditures for architecture and engineering, construction
   and purchased and personal services contracts in the specific areas
   included in our audit have increased over the past three bienniums as
   displayed in the graph below.

                               [Contract1.gif]

   Because this is a significant amount of money, and because of
   legislative interest, the results of previous agency audits, and the
   number of whistleblower assertions related to contracting, the State
   Auditor’s Office identified the need to audit practices for these four
   types of contracts on a statewide basis. However, because of their
   nature, we excluded client service contracts and grant awards from this
   audit and plan to perform comprehensive audits in these areas at a
   later time.

   We included in our plan an examination of the internal controls used to
   help ensure compliance with laws and regulations and to help prevent
   and detect fraud. We also included an examination of specific
   transactions performed by various state agencies when formally
   procuring, monitoring, and making payments for contracts with private
   contractors.

   PURPOSES OF AUDIT

   The specific purposes of this audit were to:
     * Evaluate whether state agencies have contracting controls that help
       to ensure:

     * Protection of assets from loss, theft or misuse.

     * Compliance with state laws and regulations.

     * Determine whether state agencies have complied with selected state
       contracting laws and regulations.

     * Identify "best practices", where specific state agency contracting
       procedures appear to be particularly effective, and to communicate
       them to the Legislature and citizens.

     * Report to the Legislature areas we identified in which state laws
       and regulations may not be sufficient to safeguard state assets.

   TYPES OF CONTRACTS INCLUDED IN AUDIT

   In performing this audit, we assessed the risks associated with the
   various types of state contracts. Accordingly, we selected the
   following general areas, along with the relevant portions of the
   Revised Code of Washington:
     * Architecture and Engineering: Professional services rendered by any
       person, other than as an employee of the agency, contracting to
       perform activities as an architect, engineer, land surveyor, or
       landscape architect. We included all types of expenditures in this
       general area.

     * Chapter 39.80 RCW

     * Construction: Services performed by a private company to construct,
       alter, repair, or make improvements (other than ordinary
       maintenance) to buildings, highways, and ferries. We included the
       following specific types of expenditures in this general area:

     * Chapters 39.04 through 39.10
       and Chapter 39.28 RCW

                                          Public works for all state agencies
     * RCW 28B.10.300-.355

                                          Construction at universities
     * Chapter 47.28 RCW

                                          Highways construction
     * RCW 47.56.030 and RCW 47.60.680-774

                                          Ferries construction

     * Purchased Services: Provision of materials, supplies, and equipment
       (including information technology) for the support, maintenance,
       and use of all state agencies and colleges; provision of services
       by a vendor to accomplish routine, continuing, and necessary
       functions. We specifically included such expenditures as supplies,
       repairs, and employee training in this general area.

     * RCW 43.19.190-1911 and RCW 43.19.200

     * Personal Services: Provision of consultant’s professional or
       technical expertise for a specific project, task, or study. In this
       general area, we included all types of expenditures except
       contracts for grants and client services.

     * Chapter 39.29 RCW

   RISKS RELEVANT TO AUDIT

   We identified risks for noncompliance or fraud mainly in three areas:
    1. Contracts might be awarded through improper procurement procedures
       or inflated through improper change orders.
    2. Improper contract payments could be made for:

     * Purposes not included in the contract.
     * Amounts that had already been paid.
     * Billings exceeding the total negotiated contract amount.
     * Work that was never performed or completed.
     * Expenses incurred before the inception of the contract.
     * Projects for personal use.
     * Excess or unapproved materials.
     * Construction retainage.

    3. Agency contract personnel might have improper beneficial interests
       in contracts under their supervision.

   Throughout the course of our audit, we also emphasized a review of the
   monitoring procedures agencies use to lower the level of risk
   associated with the above situations.

   AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS INCLUDED IN AUDIT

   We included in our audit the agencies and their corresponding
   expenditures listed on page 17 of this report. Except in a few
   instances, we audited only purchased and personal services at the
   institutions of higher education. However, we did not include all of
   the two-year community and technical colleges for which the State Board
   of Community and Technical Colleges has recorded expenditures.

   The two-year institutions we did include are:

                    Community Colleges

                                      Technical Colleges

                    Tacoma

                                      Renton

                    Green River

                                      Bates

                    Bellevue

                    Lower Columbia

                    Peninsula

                    Olympic

                    Skagit Valley

                    Whatcom

   For certain purchased services, the Department of General
   Administration procures mandatory contracts that state agencies
   generally are required to use. In addition, the Department of
   Information Services procures master voluntary information technology
   contracts, which state agencies may choose to use. As part of our
   testing, we reviewed the procedures and controls both departments use
   to procure and monitor these contracts.

   In a pilot project in fiscal year 2000, Information Services and the
   Office of Financial Management delegated to General Administration the
   authority to procure information technology purchased and personal
   services contracts for optional use by certain agencies. At the request
   of General Administration, our Office recently examined the process
   used to procure and monitor those information technology master
   contracts. The results of that separate review have been reported to
   General Administration and have been considered in this audit report.

   General Administration is responsible for procuring architectural and
   engineering services and construction contracts for many state
   agencies. We selected entire General Administration projects, including
   all applicable contracts, to examine for proper procurement procedures.
   However, we did not examine the method the agency uses to qualify
   contractors.

   AUDIT RESULTS

   State agencies and institutions we examined have established
   contracting procurement, monitoring and payment controls that help to
   ensure the protection of assets from loss, theft or misuse and also
   help to ensure compliance with state laws and regulations. In addition,
   state agencies and institutions we examined are complying with
   applicable state laws and regulations.

   At five agencies, we identified some specific practices that appear
   especially effective in safeguarding state assets and ensuring legal
   compliance. These practices include employment of trained and qualified
   personnel, proper segregation of duties, publication of detailed
   policies and procedures, use of electronic systems, and establishment
   of a cost reduction program.

   We also described several issues for the Legislature’s consideration
   regarding the strengthening of laws and regulations related to the
   safeguarding of state assets. This section includes possible
   improvements to construction contracting in the areas of change orders,
   project definition, and alternative contracting, and possible
   improvements to contracting for architecture and engineering services.
   We also noted improvements that could be made when coding contract
   payments to the accounting records.

                             State of Washington
                     July 1, 1999 through June 30, 2000

   ABOUT THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

   The State of Washington administers more than 150 departments, offices,
   commissions, boards, committees, and institutions. Accounting and
   budgeting functions at each of these are under the guidance of the
   Governor’s Office of Financial Management. During fiscal year 2000, the
   State spent almost $21 billion, $3,703,951,825 of which was related to
   contracts in the four areas we audited. The majority of these
   contracted expenditures occurred at the following agencies, which were
   included in our audit:

   The Department of Transportation primarily plans, designs and contracts
   for construction of state and federal highway systems and builds and
   operates the state ferry system. It is financed by revenue from the
   state fuel tax, motor vehicle taxes, licenses, permits, fees, federal
   reimbursements, and bond proceeds. It employs 6,800 people with a
   biennial budget of approximately $2.25 billion. The Governor appoints
   the seven volunteer members of the Transportation Commission, which
   serves as the Board of Directors. The Commission appoints the Secretary
   of Transportation, who serves as the chief executive of the Department.
   The current Secretary is Sid Morrison. In fiscal year 2000, the
   Department paid $729,749,607 for all contracts in the four general
   areas we audited.

   The Department of Social and Health Services provides services to the
   state’s most vulnerable people, including abandoned and abused
   children, the developmentally disabled, the mentally ill, and those
   needing income, food, and medical assistance. Its nearly $6 billion
   yearly budget is one of the largest components of the state’s two-year
   general fund budget. The Department is the sixth largest business in
   the state, with over 17,000 employees, or 25 percent of the state
   government work force. The Secretary in office during the period of our
   audit was Lyle Quasim; the current Secretary, who was appointed in July
   2000, is Dennis Braddock. In fiscal year 2000, DSHS paid $364,315,133
   for all contracts in the four general areas we audited.

   The Department of General Administration is the business agent for
   state government and the main state buyer of supplies, equipment, and
   services. It leases office and warehouse space for agencies and also
   plans, constructs, and remodels state buildings. In addition, it
   provides agencies with cars, parking, and internal mail services and is
   the state’s risk manager. The Department employs approximately 700
   people under the leadership of the current appointed director, Marsha
   Tadano Long. In fiscal year 2000, the Department paid $164,741,611 for
   all contracts in the four general areas we audited.

   The Department of Corrections supervises over 14,000 offenders housed
   in 12 institutions and 18 work training and pre-release facilities. The
   Department also supervises over 88,000 offenders in the community
   through 83 field offices. The agency has 6,000 employees and spends
   approximately $550 million a year, or about 8 percent of the state
   two-year general fund budget. Construction of facilities is a major
   activity and is supported by a 1999-2001 capital budget of almost $275
   million. The current secretary is Joseph D. Lehman. In fiscal year
   2000, DOC paid $199,435,169 for all contracts in the four general areas
   we audited.

   The State Parks and Recreation Commission employs 570 people to operate
   125 developed parks, several small satellite properties, and
   approximately 20 sites preserved in their natural state or held for
   future development. The agency is directed by a seven-member Commission
   appointed by the Governor. The Commission appoints the agency director,
   who is currently Cleve Pinnix. The yearly budget is almost $40 million.
   In fiscal year 2000, the agency paid $20,381,220 for all contracts in
   the four general areas we audited.

   The Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction was created in
   the Washington State Constitution to supervise all matters pertaining
   to public schools in the state. Its responsibilities include
   apportioning and distributing state education funding to 296 local
   school districts, providing technical assistance to educational service
   districts and school districts, and issuing certificates for teachers,
   administrators, and support personnel. The Superintendent, who
   currently is Terry Bergeson, is independently elected and manages an
   annual budget of $4.8 billion with a staff of 295 people. In fiscal
   year 2000, the agency paid $18,850,776 for all contracts in the four
   general areas we audited.

   The Washington State Lottery was created by the State Legislature in
   1982 to sell tickets for games of chance to the general public. The
   agency’s goal is to generate the maximum amount of net revenues. Income
   generated by the games becomes part of the state’s general fund and is
   appropriated to state programs by the Legislature. The agency generates
   yearly sales and other revenues of nearly $500 million. The current
   appointed director, Merritt D. Long, leads a staff of 150 people. In
   fiscal year 2000, the agency paid $52,940,685 for all contracts in the
   four general areas we audited.

   The Department of Information Services provides leadership and support
   for the use of information technology within state and local
   governments. The agency employs over 400 people who serve more than 600
   customers, including school districts, cities, counties, state
   agencies, colleges and universities, public utility districts, and
   tribal organizations. Included in the agency services is the provision
   of master information technology contracts for voluntary customer use.
   The agency also supports the Information Services Board, which develops
   statewide technical policies, standards, and procedures. Steve
   Kolodney, the current appointed director, administers a biennial budget
   of approximately $230 million. (For fiscal year 2000, we limited our
   audit at this agency to a review of procedures used to obtain master
   information technology contracts; we did not directly audit any
   contract payments.)

                               Best Practices
                             State of Washington
                     July 1, 1999 through June 30, 2000

   The results of this project can give the Legislature and the citizens
   of the State a great deal of assurance that state agencies and
   institutions included in this audit generally are acting as responsible
   stewards of public assets when contracting for architectural and
   engineering, construction, personal, and purchased services.

   While performing this audit, we were alert to agency practices that
   appeared particularly effective in safeguarding state assets and
   ensuring compliance with state laws and regulations. We noted several
   instances that were especially noteworthy.

   Department of Social and Health Services

   The agency has delegated to its Central Contracts Services the
   responsibility for ensuring proper personal services contract
   procurement procedures for the entire agency, including its many
   decentralized offices all over the state. Several years ago, the agency
   determined a strong emphasis was needed to improve this process. It
   began devoting more resources to contract procurement and authorized
   Contracts Services to take a more active leadership role than that of
   advisor. While agency divisions still procure their own personal
   services contracts, signature authority for personal services contracts
   over $5,000 is restricted to Contracts Services.

   Consequently, Contracts Services employs attorneys to guide contract
   procurement and to help provide training to agency personnel in such
   areas as contract drafting and monitoring, tort law, and auditing
   issues. Each agency division designates one employee as its key
   contract coordinator, a liaison between Contracts Services and the
   division. Contracts Services routinely meets with these employees to
   provide training and to exchange information.

   Contracts Services has developed improved policies and procedures,
   including clear standardized forms to be used in various contracting
   activities. Contracts Services also has emphasized the development of a
   central contracts database that should be operational in the near
   future. Until now, the Department has had no easy means of determining
   the total amount and composition of its personal services contracts.

   We found clear indications that the improvements undertaken have had a
   beneficial effect on agency procedures for procuring personal services
   contracts.

   State Parks and Recreation Commission

   The agency has developed successful methods allowing quick access to
   all agency construction contract information. Each contract is
   supported by a booklet with information documenting the advertisement
   for bid and a copy of the lowest bid information. Additional files
   contain other relevant information, such as plans, specifications,
   approved change orders and correspondence. Such organization helps the
   agency quickly retrieve relevant information.

   University of Washington

   We found particularly strong controls over purchased and personal
   services contract procurement at this institution. For both kinds of
   contracts, the University has ensured that responsibilities for
   initiating purchases, awarding contracts, monitoring services received
   and budget activities, paying invoices, and approving staff decisions
   have been adequately separated. This ensures that no one person has
   complete control over any stage of a contract.

   The University has delegated buying responsibilities to those with
   sufficient training in and knowledge of products, vendors, distinctions
   between purchased and personal services, and state and federal
   regulations, including ethics requirements. University personnel with
   whom we dealt during our audit were knowledgeable, capable, and
   receptive to suggestions, making changes when issues were brought to
   their attention.

   During our review of construction contracting practices, we noted the
   University’s policy of hiring extremely knowledgeable and experienced
   professionals to manage its projects, including an attorney familiar
   with contracting requirements and recent court rulings. The University
   Capital Projects Office also maintains a separate policy and procedures
   manual for every project over $10 million.

   Department of Transportation

   The Department has instituted the Cost Reduction Incentive Proposals
   program to encourage highway construction contractors to generate
   cost-saving ideas for the projects on which they are working. The
   proposals can relate to design changes, product substitutions, or
   deletions of unnecessary work. A contractor who develops such a
   proposal is entitled to 50 percent of the savings, if certain
   conditions are met. The Department reports that, between January and
   June 2000, the program generated savings to the state of $767,870
   through 11 different proposals.

   The Washington State Ferries System, which is part of the Department,
   has a similar program, (Shared Savings Proposals) for larger vessel
   construction and preservation contracts.

   In an effort to establish better communications with contractors, the
   Ferries System also recently began posting its complete Invitation for
   Bids and Request for Proposal packages on its web site at
   http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/your_wsf/doing_business_with/contracts/
   . Contractors may use web site forms in preparing their proposals. The
   site also describes future projects not yet ready to be let for bids.

   Green River Community College

   Generally, personal services contracts subject to competitive
   solicitation requirements must be filed with and, in some cases,
   reviewed and approved by the Office of Financial Management. One
   exception is contracts for a fee of less than $5,000, if the total
   contracts from the agency with the same contractor do not exceed $5,000
   in a fiscal year. This $5,000 cumulative amount can be difficult to
   track. The College has developed a spreadsheet system to allow it to
   monitor smaller contracts that cumulatively may exceed the $5,000
   limit. When the cumulative amount exceeds $3,000, administrators are
   advised not to enter into new contracts with that vendor until they
   work through the purchasing manager. The purchasing manager then has
   the information needed to ensure proper notification is made to the
   Office of Financial Management when required.

                    Issues for Legislative Consideration
                             State of Washington
                     July 1, 1999 through June 30, 2000

   During the course of our audit procedures, we noted several issues that
   we believe the Legislature may want to consider.

   Construction Change Orders

   While planning the audit of construction contracts, we noted the
   absence of state law specifically defining limitations on the use of
   state agency change orders for either dollars spent or tasks performed.
   While state laws (RCW 39.04.010 and RCW 39.28.020(5)) call for
   advertisements defining the scope and nature of the proposed project
   for prospective bidders, there is no state law dealing with the use of
   change orders occurring after a contract award.

   During the bidding process, the state emphasizes the need for open and
   fair competition to obtain the best available price. However,
   adjustments or conditions that occur during the course of a project can
   be added through change orders for which there are no specific state
   requirements or guidelines. Questions such as the following are left to
   the discretion of the agency providing the change order:
     * What defines a project?
     * What defines work as being within or without the project scope?
     * What is a reasonable amount or percentage for change orders?
     * What constitutes a fundamental project or contract change that
       would require rebidding?

   Change orders usually are initiated after the work has begun or
   sometimes after the work is complete. This may result in additional
   costs to the contracting agency due to lack of estimates or clear
   guidance to the contractor. In addition, while determining whether a
   bid is responsive is required by state competitive bid laws, such a
   determination is not a requirement if an agency adds a contractor
   through the change order process. This process may result in agencies
   not performing proper background checks, putting agencies at risk
   should contractors not complete the requested work. Adding contractors
   via change orders may result in agencies not requiring proper business
   licenses, insurance, and bonding, all of which are requirements of the
   competitive bid process.

   We found a considerable amount of construction contract expenditures
   occurring through the use of change orders that required no additional
   competitive solicitation. Some of these change orders significantly
   increased the amount of the original contract, some appeared to
   significantly change the contract scope, and some, because of their
   quantity, may indicate lack of careful preparation of the original
   statement of work.

   We analyzed the number and content of change orders completed in both
   the construction contracts included in our selected transactions and
   those contracts the agencies considered completed during fiscal year
   2000. Some of the unusual circumstances we noted are described below.
     * A contract to renovate one building, originally for $598,651, was
       increased through the use of 19 change orders to $2,489,478, a 316
       percent increase from the original price. Of this latter amount,
       $712,559 appeared to be outside of the original scope, as the costs
       were related to expanded activities on the building and to the
       addition to the project of four other buildings. The modifications
       outlined in another change order for $566,500 related properly to
       the original statement of work; however, the costs included in this
       change order were almost as high as the original contract itself.
       The change orders in total delayed completion of the original
       project by 516 days.

     * One institution properly bid and contracted for seismic refit work
       in the amount of $748,000. A subsequent change order in the amount
       of $419,269 was made to remodel certain areas inside the building.
       The scope of work provided under this change order was materially
       different from the original project. As a result, fair and
       equitable treatment was not given to other contractors, and the
       public cannot be assured it received the best price for the
       remodel.

     * The number of change orders for two other contracts were
       significantly out of proportion to most of the other contracts we
       analyzed. One contract was originally awarded for $32,782,000 and
       later increased by $2,198,884 through the use of 196 change orders.
       Another was awarded for $650,000 and increased through 54 change
       orders by $155,733, an average of less than $3,000 per change
       order.

     * For the five selected on-going contracts we tested at one agency,
       we found a total of 731 change orders, as shown below:

     Original Contract Amount Number of Change Orders To Date Total Amount
   of Change Orders To Date Total Contract Amount To Date
   1. $24,324,000 366 $5,856,519 $30,180,591
   2. 26,024,908 133 2,300,000 28,324,908
   3. 30,328,001 12 2,300,000 32,628,001
   4. 10,801,273 86 1,982,678 12,783,951
   5. 50,252,892 134 5,044,302 55,297,194
   $141,731,074 731 $17,483,499 $159,214,573

     The same agency reported the completion of 60 construction contracts
     during fiscal year 2000. The five largest of these account for 83
     percent of the fiscal year expenditures for these completed
     contracts. Change order information for these five is reported
     below:

     Original Amount Number of Change Orders Total Amount of Change Orders
   Total Contract Amount
   1. $28,660,695 431 $4,969,472 $33,630,167
   2. 27,039,429 472 7,474,503 34,513,932
   3. 10,888,000 226 1,583,257 12,471,257
   4. 13,641,000 147 1,228,696 14,869,696
   5. 24,184,476 520 5,406,586 29,591,062
     $104,413,600 1,796 $20,662,514 $125,076,114

   We reviewed recent audit issues and related change order requirements
   in 16 other states. We noted that eight states reported change orders
   that were not adequately reviewed and/or approved in a timely fashion,
   including some which were never approved until after the work was
   completed or were charged to other accounts to avoid the review and
   approval process. Inadequate documentation and cost justifications were
   described by several states. Two states reported change orders outside
   of the original scope of the contracts, and four described large cost
   overruns resulting from inadequate project planning. One state reported
   change orders with unallowable costs, while another reported the
   improper use of change orders for an unrelated project.

   While change order issues appear to be widespread, we also noted that
   many states have established at least minimal change order
   requirements, either in code or in policy, to which agencies must
   adhere and to which examiners can audit. The list below describes a few
   of these regulations, which may be worthy of consideration by the State
   of Washington.
     * California publishes a contracting manual with an entire section on
       the change order approval process.

     * Delaware state law requires that change orders be within the
       publicized scope of the contract.

     * Hawaii requires all change orders to be approved by certain
       procurement officers and requires each contract to include a
       process and price lists for use in the event of change orders.

     * Maryland limits change order approval to certain agencies, in most
       cases. However, if modifications change the contract scope or if
       individual change orders increase the contract amount or any cost
       component by more than $50,000, approval is required from the Board
       of Public Works, which consists of the governor, state treasurer
       and state comptroller.

     * Pennsylvania has provided administrative procedures which outline a
       step-by-step process for developing change orders.

     * Massachusetts state law requires change orders to be within the
       original scope of the contract. A director must approve change
       orders in excess of 5 percent of the contract or greater than
       $5,000. Internal audits of all large change orders are mandatory,
       unless a director states in writing why such an audit will not be
       performed.

     * Mississippi state law limits individual change orders to no more
       than 1 percent of the total contract amount and gives agencies
       authority to limit the number, manner and frequency of change
       orders.

     * New York provides that the state comptroller must pre-audit and
       approve all contracts and change orders with a value of $15,000 or
       greater.

     * Utah policies require each contract to provide a contingency budget
       between 4.5 percent and 9.5 percent of the contract amount,
       depending on the type of construction.

     * Virginia restricts contract increases to 25 percent or $50,000,
       whichever is greater, unless the Governor provides written approval
       for larger amounts.

   Currently in this state, agencies for the most part must work
   independently to determine what, if any, procedures are needed to
   adequately safeguard state assets during the change order process.
   There is little guidance to assist them in this effort. Because of the
   common use of change orders, the large dollar amounts which may be
   involved, and the variety of problems which might occur, we urge the
   Legislature to consider providing change order criteria to help ensure
   the proper safeguarding of these state assets.

   Project Definition

   In this area, we again found little guidance for agencies and auditors
   to consider. State law requires the development of complete plans and
   specifications for a project, without defining what these plans should
   include or what constitutes a project. For example, it is sometimes
   difficult to determine from the documents provided whether a project
   has been intentionally split to avoid competitive bid requirements.
   Separate projects conducted at the same location, at the same time, and
   by the same department may really be one project that should have been
   put out for public bid. In addition, we have noted that projects
   significantly over budget often result from poorly written
   specifications. The State may wish to consider establishing some
   guidance for agencies to use when completing plans and specifications.

   Alternative Contracting

   State law (RCW 39.10) provides for alternative public works contracting
   methods, including procedures for the use of general
   contractor/construction managers by selected state agencies and local
   governmental units for certain contracts valued over $10 million. In
   such a process, the agency, after formal advertisement and competitive
   bids, selects a general contractor/construction manager to provide
   services during the design phase and to act as the construction manager
   and general contractor during construction. This alternative procedure
   requires a negotiated maximum allowable construction cost guaranteed by
   the firm.

   Under certain circumstances, the general contractor/construction
   manager may bid on subcontract work for projects valued over $20
   million. These circumstances include notification in the public bid
   solicitation of the general contractor/construction manager’s intent to
   bid.

   Allowing the general contractor/construction manager to bid for
   subcontractor work may actually have a limiting effect on competition
   and on the basic premise that the bid process should be open, fair and
   competitive. Because the general contractor/construction manager helps
   determine the estimated costs for each bid package, he/she may have an
   unfair advantage when it comes to bidding for subcontractor work.
   During our review of this type of contracting, we examined two large
   contracts, totaling approximately $56 million, where the general
   contractor/construction manager made a notification of intent to bid on
   a total of nine subcontracts. As a result, the general
   contractor/construction manager was awarded eight of these contracts
   and received no competition for six.

   Architecture and Engineering Contracts

   During our audit of architecture and engineering contracts, we
   discovered areas in which state laws on procurement of these services
   could be more clear. Specifically, the law is silent on whether an
   architecture and engineering contract may be procured, without any
   competition, by contracting with a firm that is considered the sole
   source able to do the work. Laws governing the procurement of other
   services provide guidance on required procedures before a contractor
   may be considered a sole source.

   Further, the law on procuring architecture and engineering services
   requires that an agency shall encourage an annual statement of
   qualifications from firms that provide such services. Many large
   architecture and engineering contracts can last longer than a year. The
   Legislature may want to consider whether architecture and engineering
   contracts should go through a formal process for renewal after a
   certain number of years. This process might include a review of
   qualifications or renewal of competition, with a new contract written
   as a result.

   Account Coding of Contract Expenditures

   We found that contract managers generally analyzed a desired service
   correctly when determining the appropriate procurement method. However,
   we found numerous accounting errors in the agency fiscal records, when
   payments for these contracts were improperly coded. On a statewide
   basis, we found 49 payments coded in the accounting records as
   purchased services that should have been coded to various types of
   personal services. We also found 42 payments coded as personal services
   that should have been coded to other accounts, including nine to
   purchased services and 22 to architectural and engineering.

   This type of error causes the fiscal year totals to be misstated,
   resulting in incorrect data for Legislative, budgeting, and management
   purposes. There is limited assurance that the total amount of reported
   state expenditures in these areas is accurate or complete; however,
   these errors would have no overall material effect on the state’s
   financial opinion.

   These miscodings appear to occur due to a lack of sufficient training
   in a complex area and to inadequate communications between contract
   managers and accounting staff. State agencies have an obligation to
   ensure proper accounting records and should be encouraged to offer
   sufficient training to employees and to consult with oversight agencies
   such as the Office of Financial Management and the Department of
   General Administration when necessary.
