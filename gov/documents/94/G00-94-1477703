   4United States Copyright OfficeCopyright Office Fees IN GENERAL The
   1976 Copyright Act (title 17 of the United States cular Code)
   established statutory fees for certain services pro- vided by the
   Copyright Office. These services include regis- tering claims to
   copyright and renewal of claims, as well as recordation of documents,
   searches of copyright records, and other services. In 1997 Congress
   passed a law giving the Register of Copyrights the authority to set
   these fees if certain conditions were met. See Pub. L. 105-80, III
   Stat. 1529 (1997). Section 708(a)(10) authorizes the Register of
   Copyrights to charge additional fees. The additional fees are fixed on
   the "basis of the cost of providing the service" "for any other special
   services requiring a substantial amount of time or expense." Cir For
