                    UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT
                      FOR THE DISTRICT OF OREGON
   In Re:
                                            GENERAL ORDER NO. 01-1
   RETENTION OF SECURED PROPERTY WITHOUT REAFFIRMATION;

   SALE OF PUBLICLY HELD SECURITIES BY A CH. 7 TRUSTEE;
   REQUEST TO RECEIVE ELECTRONIC NOTICES FROM THE
   BANKRUPTCY NOTICING CENTER (BNC); AND DISCLOSURE OF
   OWNERSHIP
   IT IS ORDERED that points 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 below are effective
   immediately as to all bankruptcy cases pending, filed or reopened
   in this court on or after the FILED date of this General Order,
   point 8 is effective on and after May 1, 2001 as to all such
   cases, and points 3 and 4 will be effective on and after June 1,
   2001 as to all such cases (although the 6/1/01 versions of LBFs
   #1300 and #1350 may be used at any time after they become
   available from the court's Internet site @ www.orb.uscourts.gov).
   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT:
       1.  To clarify a secured creditor's rights regarding
   property a Chapter 7 debtor has designated on the debtor's
   Statement of Intent form (LBF #521) that it will be retained by
   such debtor, but the underlying debt will not be reaffirmed since
   the contract is current, LBR 1007-3.A.1. will be supplemented
   with the following additional section:
            Secured Creditor Rights When Debtor Does Not Reaffirm
            Debt Since Contract Current.  If a Chapter 7 debtor
            marks on the Statement of Intent form (LBF #521) that
            secured property will be retained, but the underlying
            debt will not be reaffirmed because the contract
            payments are current, the debtor will be deemed to have
            authorized the affected creditor to continue automatic
            withdrawals of payments if authorized by the debtor
            prepetition, and to mail to the debtor:  (1) coupon
            books; (2) notices regarding payment changes; and (3)
            account statements.
       2.  To clarify the deadline for filing a timely proof of
   claim in a Chapter 11 case, LBR 3001-1.A.2. is supplemented with
   the following section:
            General.  A proof of claim in a Chapter 11 case is
            timely filed if it is filed pursuant to the provisions
            of FRBP 3002(c).
       3.  LBR 3015-1. is amended by, and point 1 of General Order
   No. 97-1 is totally superseded with, the following language:
            A party filing a Chapter 13 Plan as required by LBRs
            3015-1.B. or 3015-1.C. shall only use LBF #1300, and
            such LBF must have a version date no older than 6/1/01.
            A party filing a Chapter 13 Confirmation Order as
            required by LBRs 3015-1.B. or 3015-1.C. shall only use
            LBF #1350, and such LBF must have a version date no
            older than 6/1/01.
       4.  Point 4 of General Order No. 98-2, regarding disposition
   of funds in a trustee's possession upon conversion/dismissal of a
   case from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7, is abrogated by paragraph 14
   of any Chapter 13 Confirmation Order (LBF #1350) that has a
   version date no older than 6/1/01.
       5.  To help ensure the timely granting of relief from the
   automatic stay of 11 U.S.C. Section 362 regarding property to be
   surrendered, LBR 4001-1. will be supplemented with the following
   new section:
            DEBTOR'S CONSENT TO RELIEF FROM STAY RE:  PROPERTY TO
            BE SURRENDERED
            Marking the "Property Will be Surrendered" box on a
            debtor's Chapter 7 Statement of Intent form (LBF #521)
            shall constitute the debtor's consent to either
            judicial or non-judicial relief from the automatic stay
            upon the earlier of actual surrender, the trustee's
            granting of non-judicial relief from stay by execution
            of LBF #750 as to the property, or expiration of the
            time deadlines in 11 U.S.C. Section 521.
       6.  LBR 6004-1. will be supplemented for administrative
   efficiency with the following section:
            SALE OF PUBLICLY HELD SECURITIES BY CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEES
            A Chapter 7 trustee may, as to estate property and
            without notice or further court order, both:
                      1.   Sell publicly traded securities for
                      which there is an established market,
                      exercise and/or sell options therein, and
                      compensate the licensed stockbroker or other
                      licensed non-insider institutional broker at
                      standard industry rates not to exceed
                      $3,000.00; and
                      2.   Redeem bonds.
       7.  To promote the electronic transmission of a notice by
   the Bankruptcy Noticing Center (BNC) pursuant to the terms and
   procedures for electronic noticing by the BNC detailed in the
   Electronic Noticing Agreement, the court adopts the following
   sections which supplement FRBP 9036:
            a.  The court will permit the Bankruptcy Noticing
            Center (BNC) to electronically transmit notices to any
            entity which requests this service by completing and
            executing the Electronic Noticing Agreement and, if
            applicable, the appropriate Evidence of Authority
            Form(s) which must be subsequently executed by the
            clerk; and
            b.  The clerk may delegate to the BNC the authority to
            enter into and monitor Electronic Noticing Agreements
            with entities who are acting solely on their own behalf
            or, in an instance where an entity is acting as agent
            for others, those agreements which are executed by both
            the party and the agent.
       8.  Canon 3C(1)(c) of the Code of Conduct for United States
   Judges requires judges to recuse themselves from cases when they
   own stock in a parent company whose subsidiary appears as a party
   before the judge.  Ownership of stock in a subsidiary company
   whose parent appears before the judge is not per se
   disqualifying.  Therefore, in order to determine if recusal is
   required, and in accordance with 28 U.S.C. Section 2071(e), the
   following provisions apply:
                       OWNERSHIP DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
       A.   WHO MUST FILE
       Every corporation or partnership which is an interested
       party in any contested matter or adversary proceeding, if
       either (a) it has a parent corporation, or (b) 10% or more
       of any class of the interested party's shares or equity
       securities is owned by any publicly traded corporation.
       B.   CONTENTS OF OWNERSHIP DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
       An ownership disclosure statement filed pursuant to this
       rule shall include:
                 1.   The name of the party;
                 2.   The name of any parent corporation, and/or
                      any publicly held corporation owning 10% or
                    more of any class of the interested party's
                      shares or equity securities;
                 3.   The name of any publicly held corporation
                      owning 10% or more of any class of the shares
                      or equity securities of any company disclosed
                      under either sub-point 2., or this sub-point;
                      and
                 4.   A certificate of service certifying that a
                      copy of such disclosure was served on each
                      adverse party.
       C.   WHEN TO FILE
            A party must:
                 1.   File an ownership disclosure statement
                      pursuant to this rule at the same time as any
                      petition for relief, complaint, motion,
                      objection, application or request for
                      hearing, or any answer, response or
                      opposition thereto, unless an ownership
                      disclosure statement has previously been
                      filed by the party in the same case or
                      adversary proceeding.  An ownership
                      disclosure statement should not be filed with
                      a proof of claim, request for notice, or
                      Chapter 11 ballot.
                 2.   Promptly file a supplemental ownership
                      disclosure statement upon change in the
                      information that the statement requires.
       D.   NUMBER OF COPIES
       Any interested party required to file an ownership
       disclosure statement shall file BOTH an original AND a
       "JUDGE'S COPY".
