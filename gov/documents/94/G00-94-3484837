                         NASA Website Privacy Statement

   This policy establishes how NASA will use information we gather about
   you from your visit to our website. The privacy of our customers is of
   utmost importance to NASA.

   If you visit a NASA site...
     * To read or download information: We may collect and store
       information for statistical purposes. For example, we may count the
       number of visitors to the different sections of our site to help us
       make them more useful to visitors. Similar information is gathered
       for anonymous ftp, remote account login, or for other comparable
       types of connections.
     * To send us an E-mail: By sending us an electronic mail message, you
       may be sending us personal information (e.g., name, address, E-mail
       address), as in an official Freedom of Information Act request. We
       may store the name and address of the requester in order to respond
       to the request or to otherwise resolve the subject matter of your
       E-mail.
     * To register: Some of our sites ask visitors who request specific
       information to fill out a registration form. For example, vendors
       looking for marketing opportunities by visiting our Electronic
       Grants or NASA Acquisition Internet Service sites may be asked to
       "register" to obtain copies of Requests for Proposals or other NASA
       opportunities. Other information which may be collected at these
       sites through questionnaires, feedback forms, or other means,
       enable us to determine a visitor's interests, with the goal of
       providing better service to our customers.
     * Cookies: NASA uses advanced technologies as part of its core
       mission to discover and inform. Cookie technology may be
       implemented at some NASA web sites. Cookies store small amounts of
       information, sometimes including information you have given us, and
       are only used to make your visit to those web sites more usable and
       friendly. At no time is information you have given us, whether
       stored in cookies or elsewhere, shared with third parties that have
       no right to that information. If you do not wish to have web
       cookies stored on your machine, you can turn them off. However,
       this may impact the functioning of some NASA sites. We do not store
       any privacy information in cookies at this site.

   We want to be very clear: regardless of the information being
   transmitted to NASA, we will protect all such information consistent
   with applicable law.
