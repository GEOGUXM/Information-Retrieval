                                Introduction

   The Senegal Project is a community-based natural resources management
   project. The primary goal of the project was to develop, test, and
   provide a framework designed for long-term monitoring of Senegal's
   natural resources. The framework has a backward capability by providing
   a platform for utilizing historical data from the past 20 to 30 years
   and has forward versatility by providing a means for utilizing new data
   as they become available. By understanding long-term environmental
   changes in Senegal's resources, decision makers are more capable of
   setting realistic agricultural and environmental policies in order to
   protect natural resources and to promote economic growth.
