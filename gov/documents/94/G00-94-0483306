            OVERVIEW
            The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) promotes the policy of
            recycling first.


                                                    NOVEMBER 2001 CONFERENCE
       Make plans now to attend the first international conference hosted in
           the United States on the "Beneficial Use of Recycled Materials in
                                               Transportation Applications."

            RECYCLING TEAM
            To facilitate the use of recycled materials in the highway
            environment, FHWA has created a new recycling team. The team is
            completing its business plan and developing a White Paper on
            recycling.

            The team's role is to:
            Increase FHWA's and our partners' awareness of the existing
            recycling knowledge.
            Identify, foster, and promote research to develop or test new
            technology.

            Foster the review, evaluation, and advancement of emerging
            technology.

            Identify and help overcome barriers.

            Coordinate recycling activities within FHWA.

            Facilitate coordination and cooperation with State highway agencies,
            State environmental agencies, the U.S. Environmental Protection
            Agency, and industry.
