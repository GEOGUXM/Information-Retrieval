   Bibliography for lesser scaup (Aythya affinis)

   Bibliography for northern pintails (Anas acuta)
   Subject: The bibliography provides over 1900 citations pertinent to
   Northern Pintails (Anas acuta). The bibliography covers a wide variety
   of sources, including some unpublished and "gray" literature. Citations
   included range from scientific articles specific to pintails to fauna
   guides and other general sources.

   DUCKDATA a bibliographic database for North American waterfowl and
   their wetland habitats.
   Summary: Provides a comprehensive bibliography of published literature
   on the ecology, conservation, and management of North American
   waterfowl and their wetland habitats.

   Effects of management practices on grassland birds
   "These reports are a series of literature syntheses on North American
   grassland birds. The need for these reports was identified by the
   Prairie Pothole Joint Venture (PPJV), a part of the North American
   Waterfowl Management Plan. The PPJV recently adopted a new goal, to
   stabilize or increase populations of declining grassland- and
   wetland-associated wildlife species in the Prairie Pothole Region. To
   further that objective, it is essential to understand the habitat needs
   of birds other than waterfowl, and how management practices affect
   their habitats. The focus of these reports is on management of breeding
   habitat, particularly in the northern Great Plains."

   A bibliography of fisheries biology in North and South Dakota
   Summary: The primary purpose of this bibliography was to list as many
   fisheries biology and related references as possible from North Dakota
   and South Dakota waters for use by fishery biologists. Selected
   references from contiguous states sharing river basins with the Dakotas
   are included. Studies in the Missouri River downstream from Gavins
   Point Dam are also included. In addition to published fishery and
   related aquatic studies, attempts were made to list all dissertations
   and Masters theses in these fields.

   Biology of the Rio Grande border region : a bibliography
   Summary: This bibliography includes 1,913 references to the literature
   of the Rio Grande (Rio Bravo del Norte). The specific geographic area
   covered extends 100 km on either side of the river from Elephant Butte
   Dam in New Mexico to the Gulf of Mexico. The bibliography focuses on
   the biological literature, divided into major subject areas, and also
   includes supporting literature from the physical and environmental
   sciences.

   Aquatic, Wetland and Invasive Plant Database (APIRS)
   Summary: The Aquatic, Wetland and Invasive Plant Database (APIRS),
   maintained by the Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants at the
   University of Florida in Gainesville, is a computerized bibliographic
   database (Copyright University of Florida, 1998) devoted to freshwater
   aquatic and wetland plants, as well as terrestrial and aquatic invasive
   plants. The database includes citations for about 50,000 research
   articles, books, and reports about aquatic plant ecology, physiology,
   utilization and control. Items in many languages dating back to the
   18th century are in this inclusive database.

   Bibliography for aquatic plants

   North Dakota vegetation a bibliography
   Summary: North Dakota's vegetation studies offer vast amounts of
   information on the plants and communities of the state. They cover the
   spectrum of pure and applied vegetation sciences - from range
   management to environmental impact to succession theory - and have
   correspondingly broad utility. This great information resource
   represents an important bibliographic topic because its pertinent
   references are widely scattered. A bibliography of North Dakota
   vegetation could facilitate information exchange between pure and
   applied disciplines. It could help in the dissemination of important
   results and conclusions from unpublished works. It could simplify the
   task of designing research and management projects to build on earlier
   research to the fullest extent. Recognizing these needs, this
   bibliography was developed as a preliminary vegetation reference guide
   for biologists who deal with any aspect of native vegetation research
   and management in North Dakota.
