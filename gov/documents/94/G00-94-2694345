              Version Management Sample with Browser Detection

   This sample contains a Version Management control hidden at the bottom
   of the page. The buttons below call the various methods of the Version
   Management control through their OnClick event using JavaScript.
   You must close all FormFlow 99 forms in order for the Version
   Management control to update your form objects and controls. Form
   objects which are currently in use will not be updated, even if the
   update appears successful.

   [BUTTON Input] (not implemented)_______________
   The UpdateControls method displays the Update Controls dialog box,
   which enables you to manually select which form objects to update. Note
   that you will not be able to install the Entrust Server Control unless
   certain required files are already present on your computer.
   [BUTTON Input] (not implemented)__________________ The
   AnalyzeAndUpdateVersions method compares the versions of the form
   objects on the server with the versions installed on your computer.
   Depending on the Administrator settings in controls.txt, your controls
   will either be updated automatically, or you will be prompted to update
   your controls as required.
   [BUTTON Input] (not implemented)________________ The SendDiagnostics
   method sends form object versions and other environment information
   about a users computer to the server through anonymous FTP. Note that
   the FTP path specified under the Diagnostics settings in controls.txt
   must exist and allow anonymous write access in order for this method to
   work.
