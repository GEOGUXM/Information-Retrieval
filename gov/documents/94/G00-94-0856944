   Take a Tour of Our Site

   We're in the process of changing our Web site and thought it would be a
   good idea to give our customers an overview of these changes, as well
   as a walk-through of the site in general.  For this purpose, we've put
   together a presentation using Microsoft PowerPoint.  Because this file
   is quite large, we've created a self-extracting, compressed version of
   it using WinZip.  Simply download this "zipped" file to your computer,
   then double-click it to start the file extraction process.  The
   PowerPoint slideshow file will then be automatically copied into the
   directory of your choice. You do not need an unzip program on your
   computer to extract the file.
     * webtour.exe (self-extracting file) - 1.6 MB

   Don't have Microsoft PowerPoint installed on your computer?  No
   problem!  You can download Microsoft's free PowerPoint Viewer from
   their Web site.

   We are also offering a PDF version of the slideshow which, due to its
   size, is being provided as a self-extracting file.
     * webtour_pdf.exe (self-extracting) - 3.7 MB
