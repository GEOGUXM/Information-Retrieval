   Background

   Since 1986 I have provided bioinformatics support for biomedical
   research projects, including database and analysis program maintenance
   and update, consultation and assistance for researchers using protein
   and nucleotide analysis, phylogenetic analysis, and linkage analysis.
   Collaborations have focused on statistical analysis of nucleotide
   sequences to determine relevant patterns for functional analysis
   predictions.

   Prior to coming to the ABCC I worked for 14 years in a protein
   chemistry lab characterizing and analyzing viral proteins.
