      ________________________________________________________________

   1.    What is Chapter 7?

   Chapter 7 refers to Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the United States Code
   (the Bankruptcy Title).  Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code
   is the Bankruptcy Code's "liquidation" chapter. Lawyers sometimes refer
   to it as a "straight bankruptcy." It is used primarily by individuals
   who wish to free themselves of debt simply and inexpensively, but may
   also be used by businesses that wish to liquidate and terminate their
   business.  For more detailed information, click here.

   2.   What is Chapter 11?

   Chapter 11 refers to Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code
   (the Bankruptcy Title).  A case filed under chapter 11 of the United
   States Bankruptcy Code is frequently referred to as a "reorganization"
   bankruptcy.  While an individual may file under Chapter 11, the
   provisions of chapter 11 are generally used to reorganize a business.
   Chapter 11 allows the debtor to continue its business operations by
   means of a plan of reorganization, which must meet certain statutory
   criteria.  The debtor is given a chance to restructure its finances so
   that it may continue to operate, provide its employees with jobs, pay
   its creditors, and produce a return for its stockholders.  For more
   detailed information, click here.

   3.    What is Chapter 12?

   Chapter 12 refers to Chapter 12 of Title 11 of the United States Code
   (the Bankruptcy Title). Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code was enacted
   by Congress in 1986, specifically to meet the needs of financially
   distressed family farmers. The primary purpose of this legislation was
   to give family farmers facing bankruptcy a chance to reorganize their
   debts and keep their farms.

   4.    What is Chapter 13?

   Chapter 13 refers to Chapter 13 of Title 11 of the United States Code
   (the Bankruptcy Title). Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code
   is frequently referred to as a "wage earner" chapter, although it is
   available to individuals with regular income from any source, not just
   wages. Chapter 13 is designed for individuals with regular income who
   desire to pay their debts but are currently unable to do so. The
   purpose of Chapter 13 is to enable financially distressed individual
   debtors, under court supervision and protection, to propose and carry
   out a repayment plan under which creditors are paid over an extended
   period of time.  For more detailed information, click here.

   6. How do I get to my 341 meeting location?
