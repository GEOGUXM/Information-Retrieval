     The hard x-ray (HX) band, from ~5-600 keV reveals an unusually rich
    range of astrophysical processes in both compact and diffuse sources.
   The HX band is key for study of the obscured universe, particularly the
    heavily absorbed active galactic nuclei (AGN) of galaxies. A deep HX
          survey, can reveal the accretion history of the universe.
    The HX band includes the transition from primarily thermal objects --
    either optically thin, like supernova remnants or galaxy clusters, or
       optically thick, like the blackbody emission components of high
         luminosity x-ray binaries -- to objects which are primarily
     non-thermal, or at least display significantly Comptonized spectra.
     Examples of the very hottest thermal plasmas directly measurable in
   astronomical objects, the ~10^(8-9)K coronae around or above accretion
    disks in compact binaries and active galactic nuclei (AGN), are best
      studied in the HX band. The rapid pace of discovery of hard x-ray
   emission from black hole binaries (the x-ray novae) as well as AGN have
    shown that most of their radiated power comes out at ~100 keV. Black
    holes are thus both identified and studied most directly in the hard
                                 x-ray band.
   Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) emit most of their prodigious luminosity in the
   HX band and can be studied at the highest redshifts (z ~ 10-30) with a
   very high sensitivity (large area) HX imaging mission. GRBs may be the
   most direct probe of the earliest generation of massive stars (Pop III)
               from which the required compact objects formed.
