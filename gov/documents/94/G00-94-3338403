Biological Resources Program

   Steven Gloss, Biological Resources Program Manager

Objectives:

   Monitoring and research activities for biological resources are
   intended to develop information about the structure and function of the
   Colorado River ecosystem, as well as the impacts of differing dam
   operations on the ecosystem and associated flora and fauna. It is key
   that relationships between the biotic and abiotic components of the
   Colorado River ecosystem be addressed to predict impacts on critical
   biological resources. Monitoring activities will address management
   objectives and information needs within two programmatic activities: an
   aquatic and a terrestrial monitoring program. Specific research
   projects will be implemented to address specific questions related to
   the aquatic food base, native and non-native fish species, riparian
   vegetation, avifauna, and endangered species such as the Kanab
   ambersnail and the southwestern willow flycatcher. The effort will
   provide the knowledge base required to implement ecosystem management
   strategies within an adaptive management framework.
