Bioinstrumentation Group

   The Bioinstrumentation Group comprises physical scientists, and
   mechanical, electrical and software engineers, and is engaged in a
   number of projects for the automation of molecular biology procedures,
   for life sciences activities both within LBNL and also for external
   private-sector organizations. These activities involve the design and
   fabrication of custom apparatus to facilitate experiments, the
   programming of laboratory robots for automated operation of repetitive
   procedures, the development of improved hardware to extend the range of
   applicability of existing commercial robots, and the development of an
   integrated operating systems and databases to control and monitor
   experiments. Although some of the discrete instrumentation modules used
   in the integrated protocols are obtained commercially, there are a
   number of instances where we design our own custom instruments to
   perform functions when existing capabilities are inadequate. The
   instrumentation modules may be designed for stand-alone operation, or
   for integration into larger systems. In addition to automation
   equipment design, there is a significant effort devoted to the
   development of improved methods for fluorescence assays including DNA
   sequence analysis and mass spectrometry for molecular sizing.
