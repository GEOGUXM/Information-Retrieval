                            High Control Parolees

   SB 856 authored by Senator Thompson was enacted in 1995 in response to
   concerns regarding parolees released from prison who were not reporting
   to their designated parole agents/parole placement in a timely manner,
   or not at all. Prior to enactment of this legislation, the Department
   of Corrections had discretion to initiate search procedures for up to
   30 days without necessarily declaring the subject formally "at large."
   The Thompson bill provides that certain "high control" parolees must be
   declared "at large" when they fail to report to their assigned parole
   unit within 48 hours of release. Arrest warrants for high control
   parolees must be entered into the National Crime Information Center
   system upon the authority of the BPT within 24 hours.
