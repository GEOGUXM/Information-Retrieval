   Privacy Policy
   __________________________________________________________________

   Thank you for visiting our FOH web site and for reviewing our Privacy
   Policy. Our policy is clear and consistent with the Privacy Policy of
   our parent agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services.

       We collect no information about you, other than information
       automatically collected and stored (see below), when you visit our
       web site unless you choose to provide that information to us.

   Information Automatically Collected and Stored:

   When you browse through any web site, certain personal information
       about you can be collected. We automatically collect and
       temporarily store the following information about your visit:

     * the name of the domain you use to access the Internet (for example,
       aol.com, if you are using an American Online account, or
       stanford.edu, if you are connecting from Stanford University's
       domain);
     * the date and time of your visit;
     * the pages you visited; and
     * the address of the web site you came from when you came to visit.

       We use this information for statistical purposes and to help us
       make our site more useful to visitors. Unless it is specifically
       stated otherwise, no additional information will be collected about
       you.

   Personally Provided Information:

   You do not have to give us personal information to visit our web site.
       If you choose to provide us with additional information about
       yourself through an e-mail message, form, survey, etc., we will
       only maintain the information as long as needed to respond to your
       question or to fulfill the stated purpose of the communication.

   Disclosure:

   FOH does not disclose, give, sell or transfer any personal information
       about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement or statute.

   Intrusion Detection:

   This site is maintained by the U.S. Government. It is protected by
       various provisions of Title 18, U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18
       are subject to criminal prosecution in federal court.
       For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
       available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor
       traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change
       information, or otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized
       law enforcement investigations, and pursuant to any required legal
       process, information from these sources may be used to help
       identify an individual.

   Systems of Records:

   Information originally collected in traditional paper systems can be
       submitted electronically, i.e., electronic commerce transactions
       and information updates about eligibility for FOH services.
       Electronically submitted information is maintained and destroyed
       pursuant to the Federal Records Act, and in some cases may be
       subject to the Privacy Act. If information that you submit is to be
       used in a Privacy Act system of records, there will be a Privacy
       Act Notice provided.
