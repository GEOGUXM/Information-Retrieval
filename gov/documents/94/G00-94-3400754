EMC: Global .5-deg snow analysis (Snow depth unit is mm water equivalent)

   The snow analysis starts with the 47-km daily Air Force global snow
   depth analysis and the 23-km daily NESDIS northern hemisphere snow
   cover analysis. We interpolate both to a global .5-deg lat/long grid
   using an area-average interpolation algorithm written by M. Iredell.
   Only points with non-zero snow are entered in the interpolation.

   We use the NESDIS snow cover analysis to quality-control the snow depth
   field in the following way: If NESDIS field has no snow at a grid
   point, we remove the snow from the snow depth field. If NESDIS field
   has snow but the snow depth field indicates no snow, we arbitrarily add
   2.5 mm of water equivalent snow to the data.

   The first chart is the NESDIS snow conver field where snow cover
   greater than 50 % is shaded. We use 50% as the snow/no-snow limit. The
   second chart is the resulting snow depth analysis. The third chart is
   the southern hemisphere snow depth analysis. In addition, the snow
   cover and depth over North America are also included

   Check the dates on the chart as we will try to map daily the data from
   the previous day. The snow depth is converted from the water-equivalent
   snow amount with a 10 to 1 ratio in the display.
