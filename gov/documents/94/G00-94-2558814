                                BTSA - Basics
   Description
   The Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) Program is an
   initiative to provide formative assessment and individualized support
   based on assessment information for beginning teachers. BTSA is
   co-administered by the California Department of Education (CDE) and the
   California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC).
   Overview
   The Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment System was created by AB
   1266 (Mazzoni, 1997). This grew out of legislation established in SB
   1422 (Bergeson, 1992) based on research from the California New Teacher
   Project (CNTP). A central finding of this research identified the need
   to provide beginning teachers with focused induction support. To be
   useful, this support must be provided at a sufficient level of
   intensity to make a difference in the performance, retention, and
   satisfaction of beginning teachers. The 1997 Mazzoni legislation
   establishing BTSA encourages collaboration by local school districts,
   county offices of education, colleges and universities in the
   organization and delivery of new teacher induction.
   The 145 BTSA programs vary in organizational design and include
   individual districts, districts in collaboration with one another and
   with colleges and universities, and large consortia in which districts,
   colleges, universities, and county offices of education work together.
   BTSA programs use a variety of methods to provide targeted support,
   based on performance data, to beginning teachers. These programs use
   The California Formative Assessment and Support System for Teachers
   (CFASST) or an approved local assessment system, training experienced
   teachers in the relevance and methods for working with beginning
   teachers in a way that fully integrates support and formative
   assessment of teaching practice. These support providers assist
   beginning teachers in collecting and interpreting evidence of teaching
   performance, in reflecting on their teaching, and in identifying
   meaningful professional development activities that are targeted to
   their individual needs.
   Various trainings targeted for different audiences involved in BTSA
   (e.g., program directors, site administrators, support providers and
   beginning teachers) have been developed by the state agencies and BTSA
   programs to prepare educators for their work with or as beginning
   teachers. Local projects are supported by regional Cluster Consultants
   and Professional Development Consultants who assist districts and other
   entities wishing to initiate or improve a BTSA program. At the same
   time, the cluster staff facilitates activities such as peer review and
   data collection to ensure accountability for state funds.
   Retention rates in the profession for first- and second-year BTSA
   teachers were approximately 93% across all programs in the 1999-2000
   school year. According to an independent evaluation analyzing retention
   data for that year, retention rates did not vary significantly among
   programs serving schools with different degrees of urbanicity, programs
   at different levels of maturity, or programs of different sizes.
   Funding
   For fiscal year 2001, BTSA is funded at $ 104.6 million and is
   providing 29,000 beginning teachers with formative assessments of their
   teaching practices and professional development to promote their
   effectiveness with students; retention in teaching; and satisfaction
   with the occupation.
   Purpose/Objectives
   The California Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment Program (E.C.
   44279.2) is administered jointly by the Commission on Teacher
   Credentialing and the California Department of Education. The purposes
   of BTSA are to:
     * Provide an effective transition into the teaching career for first-
       and second-year teachers in California
     * Improve the educational performance of students through improved
       training, information, and assistance for new teachers
     * Enable beginning teachers to be effective in teaching students who
       are culturally, linguistically, and academically diverse
     * Ensure the professional success and retention of new teachers
     * Ensure that a support provider provides intensive individualized
       support and assistance to each participating beginning teacher
     * Improve the rigor and consistency of individual teacher performance
       assessments and the usefulness of assessment results to teachers
       and decision makers
     * Establish an effective, coherent system of performance assessments
       that are based on the California Standards for the Teaching
       Profession
     * Examine alternative ways in which the general public and the
       education profession may be assured that new teachers who remain in
       teaching have attained acceptable levels of professional competence
     * Ensure that an individual induction plan is in place for each
       participating beginning teacher and is based on an ongoing
       assessment of the development of the beginning teacher
     * Ensure continuous program improvement through ongoing research,
       development, and evaluation
