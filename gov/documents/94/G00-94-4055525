   In keeping with our society's interest in an open government, the
   Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) allows access to almost all Federal
   agency records. FAS, like other Federal agencies, is required to make
   records accessible to requesters. Many documents are available to the
   public without having to file a FOIA request. These include press
   releases, speeches, technical publications, statistics, congressional
   testimony, program regulations, and some letters and memoranda.
   The following questions can help guide you through the FAS FOIA request
   process:
