   ABOUT US -- CENTRAL REGION

   SEPERATOR


   The Geological Division of the U.S. Geological Survey conducts research
   on a broad range of disciplines that include such topics as geophysics,
   geochronology, earthquakes, landslide hazards, geochemistry, geologic
   mapping, climate change, oil and gas assessment, environmental
   monitoring and remediation, coal resource assessment, paleontology, and
   ecosystem analysis.

   The Geologic Divison operates out of three main office complexes that
   represent the three regions of the United States. Smaller field centers
   and observatories are operated out of the three main centers. In the
   Central Region of the United States, roughly equating to the region
   between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains, the main office
   complex is in Denver, Colorado.

   Five scientific teams, Crustal Imaging and Characterization Team, Earth
   Surface Processes Team, Energy Resources Team, Mineral Resources Team,
   and Geologic Hazards Team, have staff in the Denver office. These five
   teams conduct work for the national programs as well as working with a
   number of collaborators, customers, and partners representing federal
   and state agencies, international programs, academia, and industry.

   The Central Regional Geologist works under the Chief Geologist and
   supervises scientific activities of the five teams of the Central
   Region of the U.S. The Office of the Central Regional Geologist ensures
   that operational support activities run smoothly and that scientific
   work commitments are met.
