                             check_access script

   The check_access script for the cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/cd repository has
   been updated to use an improved scheme for access management.   Module
   maintainers are now capable of granting/revoking access to users
   without the assistance of CVS administrators.

                   Granting users write acess to a module

   Acess to CVS modules is now checked using an "allowed" file in the CVS
   module check_access.d/<module>".  The allowed file contains the names
   of users and groups of users with write permission to the module.
   These users also have permission to add others to the "check_access.d"
   allowed file.

   To add a user to a module's allowed file:
   1) "setup cdcvs"
   2) "cvs co check_access.d/<module>"
   3) edit check_access.d/<module>/allowed to include new user
   4) "cvs commit" when sitting inside either check_access.d or
   check_access.d/<module>
   _______________________________________________________________________

              Granting groups of users write access to a module

   Groups of users may be given access to a module by placing "#include
   <group name>"  in the allowed file of the module.

                           Adding users to a group

   Groups may have members of two types:
   1) Simple members
           Listed in "check_access.d/groups/<group name>/members"
   2) Members with permission to add other users
           Listed in "check_access.d/groups/<group name>/allowed"

   To add a user to a group:
   1) "setup cdcvs"
   2) "cvs co check_access.d/groups/<group name>"
   3) edit either the allowed or members file in
   check_access.d/groups/<group name>
   4) "cvs commit" when sitting inside check_access.d/groups/<group name>

   Note that other groups may be added to a group, by simply adding
   "#include <group1>" in either the allowed or members file for <group2>.

                     Adding access files for new modules

   After importing a new module into CVS, one must create an allowed file
   for that module to grant users permission to write to the module.

   1) Create an "allowed" file in an empty directory.
               The file should contain usernames and/or "#include <group>"
   lines.
   2) "cvs import check_access.d/<module> fermilab initial" inside the
   directory.

   To add users to a module later (same as directions above):
   3) "cvs co check_access.d/<module>"
   4) Edit allowed file to add users or groups.
   5) "cvs commit check_access.d/<module>/allowed"
   _______________________________________________________________________

                             Creating new groups

   One may create a new group which consists of individuals or groups:

   1) Create "allowed" and "members" (optional) files in an empty
   directory.
           The files should contain usernames and/or "#include <group>"
   lines.
   2) "cvs import check_access.d/groups/<group name> fermilab initial"
   inside the directory.

   _______________________________________________________________________

   Note that in the above discussions the <module> can also be one or more
   subdirectories below the check_access.d directory. If no such
   subdirectory exists yet, one can be added by the usual CVS means.
   (either a cvs import, or a cvs add, etc.)

   In all cases, the contents of the head revision of the allowed and
   members files is what counts.
