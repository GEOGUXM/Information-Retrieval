   R
   ecovering from a fire can be a physically and mentally draining
   process.

   When fire strikes, lives are suddenly turned around. Often, the hardest
   part is knowing where to begin and who to contact.

   The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) United States Fire
   Administration (USFA) has gathered the following information to assist
   you in this time of need. Action on some of the suggestions will need
   to be taken immediately. Some actions may be needed in the future while
   others will be on going. The purpose of this information is to give you
   the assistance needed to assist you as you begin rebuilding your life.

   The First 24 Hours
                                                                 clock.GIF

   Securing Yourself and The Site
     * Contact your local disaster relief service, such as the American
       Red Cross or the Salvation Army, to help with your immediate needs,
       such as:

       >
       temporary housing
       >
       food
       >
       medicine
       >
       eyeglasses
       >
       clothing
       >
       other essential items

     * Contact your insurance agent/company.

   Cautions
     * Do not enter the damaged site. Fires can rekindle from hidden,
       smoldering remains.
     * Normally, the fire department will see that utilities (water,
       electricity and natural gas) are either safe to use or are
       disconnected before they leave the site. Do not attempt to turn on
       utilities yourself.
     * Be watchful for structural damage caused by the fire. Roofs and
       floors may be damaged and subject to collapse.
     * Food, beverages and medicine exposed to heat, smoke, soot and water
       should not be consumed.

   Leaving Your Home

                            glasses.GIF (1635 bytes)
     * Contact your local police departments to let them know the site
       will be unoccupied.
     * In some cases it may be necessary to board up openings to
       discourage trespassers.
     * Beginning immediately, save receipts for any money you spend. These
       receipts are important in showing the insurance company what money
       you have spent related to your fire loss and also for verifying
       losses claimed on your income tax.
     * If it is safe to do so, try to locate the following items:


   > identification, such as driver’s licenses and Social Security cards

     > insurance information

     > medication information

     > eyeglasses,hearing aids or other prosthetic devices

     > valuables, such as credit cards, bank books, cash and jewelry

     * There are many people/entities that should be notified of your
       relocation, including:


   > your insurance agent/company


   > your mortgage company (also inform them of the fire)


   > your family and friends


   > your employer


   > your child’s school


   > your post office


   > any delivery services


   > your fire and police departments


   > your utility companies
     * Do not throw away any damaged goods until after an inventory is
       made. All damages are taken into consideration in developing your
       insurance claim.
     * If you are considering contracting for inventory or repair services
       discuss your plans with your insurance agent/company first.

   If You Are Insured

   ins. policy.GIF (3184 bytes)
     * Give notice of the loss to the insurance company or the insurer’s
       agent/company.
     * Ask the insurance company what to do about the immediate needs of
       the dwelling, such as covering doors, windows, and other exposed
       areas, and pumping out water.
     * Ask your insurance agent/company what actions are required of you.
       Some policyholders may be required to make an inventory of damaged
       personal property showing in detail the quantity, description and
       how much you paid for the items.

   [Return to Top]

   If You Are Not Insured
     * Your recovery from a fire loss may be based upon your own resources
       and help from your community.
     * Private organizations that may be sources of aid or information:

     > American Red Cross

     > Salvation Army

     > religious organizations

     > department of social services

     > civic organizations

     > state or municipal emergency services office

     > non-profit crisis counseling centers

   Valuing Your Property

   You will encounter different viewpoints on the value of your property
   in adjusting your fire loss or in claiming a casualty loss on your
   federal income tax. Knowing the following terms will help you
   understand the process used to determine the value of your fire loss:

   Your personal valuation: Your personal loss of goods through fire may
   be difficult to measure. These personal items have SENTIMENTAL VALUE to
   you; however, it is objective measures of value that you, the insurer,
   and the Internal Revenue Service will use as a common ground for
   discussion. Some of these objective measures are discussed below.

   Cost when purchased:
   This is an important element in establishing an item’s final value.
   Receipts will help verify the cost price.

   Fair market value before the fire:
   This concept is also expressed as ACTUAL CASH VALUE. This is what you
   could have received for the item if you had sold it the day before the
   fire. The price would reflect its cost at purchase minus the wear it
   had sustained since purchase. Depreciation is the formal term used to
   express the amount of value an item loses over a period of time.

   Value after the fire:
   This is sometimes called the item’s salvage value.

   Restoration Services

   There are companies that specialize in the restoration of fire damaged
   structures. Whether you or your insurer employs this type of service,
   be clear of who will pay. Be sure to request an estimate of cost for
   the work. Before any company is hired check their references. These
   companies provide a range of services that may include some or all of
   the following:

   >
   securing the site against further damage

   >
   estimating structural damage

   >
   repairing structural damage

   >
   estimating the cost to repair or renew items of personal property

   >
   packing, transportation, and storage of household items

   >
   securing appropriate cleaning or repair subcontractors

   >
   storing repaired items until needed

   SALVAGE HINTS

   Professional fire and water damage restoration businesses may be the
   best source of cleaning and restoring your personal belongings.
   Companies offering this service can be located in the phone directory.

   Clothing


                 clothes.GIF (2095 bytes)

   A word of caution before you begin: test garments before using any
   treatment, and follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Several of the
   cleaning mixtures described in this section contain the   substance
   Tri-Sodium Phosphate. This substance can be purchased under the generic
   name TSP. Tri-Sodium Phosphate is a caustic substance used commonly as
   a cleaning agent.It should be used with care and stored out of reach of
   children and pets. Wear rubbergloves when using if you have sensitive
   skin. Read the label for further information.

   Smoke odor and soot can sometimes be washed from clothing. The
   following formula may work for clothing that can be bleached:

   >
   4 to 6 tbsp. Tri-Sodium Phosphate

   >
   1 cup household cleaner or chlorine bleach

   >
   1 gallon warm water

   Mix well, add clothes, rinse with clear water. Dry thoroughly.

   An effective way to remove mildew from clothing is to wash the fresh
   stain with soap and warm water, rinse, and then dry in the sun. If the
   stain has not disappeared, use lemon juice and salt or a diluted
   solution of household chlorine bleach.

   Cooking Utensils

   Your pots, pans, flatware, etc., should be washed with soapy water,
   rinsed and then polished with a fine-powdered cleaner. You can polish
   copper and brass with special polish, salt sprinkled on a piece of
   lemon, or salt sprinkled on a cloth saturated with vinegar

   Electrical Appliances

   Don’t use appliances that have been exposed to water or steam until you
   have a service representative check them. This is especially true of
   electrical appliances. In addition, steam can remove the lubricant from
   some moving parts.

   If the fire department turned off your gas or power during the fire,
   call the electric or gas company to restore these services - do not try
   to do it yourself.

   Food


              refrigerator.GIF (1425 bytes)

   Wash your canned goods in detergent and water. Do the same for food in
   jars. If labels come off, be sure you mark the contents on the can or
   jar with a grease pencil. Do not use canned goods when the cans have
   bulged or rusted. Do not refreeze frozen food that has thawed.


   To remove odor from your refrigerator or freezer, wash the inside with
   a solution of baking soda and water, or use one cup of vinegar or
   household ammonia to one gallon of water. Baking soda in an open
   container or a piece of charcoal can also be placed in the refrigerator
   or freezer to absorb odor.

   Rugs and Carpets

   Rugs and carpets should be allowed to dry thoroughly. Throw rugs can be
   cleaned by beating, sweeping, or vacuuming, and then shampooing. Rugs
   should be dried as quickly as possible - lay them flat and expose them
   to a circulation of warm, dry air. A fan turned on the rugs will speed
   drying. Make sure the rugs are thoroughly dry. Even though the surface
   seems dry, moisture remaining at the base of the tufts can quickly
   cause the rug to rot. For information on cleaning and preserving
   carpets, call your carpet dealer or installer or a qualified carpet
   cleaning professional.

   Leather and Books


       book.GIF (2034 bytes)

   Wipe leather goods with a damp cloth, then a dry cloth. Stuff purses
   and shoes with newspaper to retain shape. Leave suitcases open. Leather
   goods should be dried away from heat and sun. When leather goods are
   dry, clean with saddle soap. Rinse leather and suede jackets in cold
   water and dry away from heat and sun.


   Wet books must be taken care of as soon as possible. The best method to
   save wet books is to freeze them in a vacuum freezer. This special
   freezer will remove the moisture without damaging the pages.

   If there will be a delay in locating such a freezer, then place them in
   a normal freezer until a vacuum freezer can be located. A local
   librarian can also be a good resource.

   Locks and Hinges


   lock.GIF (3230 bytes)

   Locks (especially iron locks) should be taken apart and wiped with oil.
   If locks cannot be removed, squirt machine oil through a bolt opening
   or keyhole, and work the knob to distribute the oil. Hinges should also
   be thoroughly cleaned and oiled.

   Walls, Floors and Furniture

   To remove soot and smoke from walls, furniture and floors, use a mild
   soap or detergent or mix together the following solution:

   >
   4 to 6 tbsp. Tri-Sodium Phosphate

   >
   1 cup household cleaner or chlorine bleach

   >
   1 gallon warm water

   Wear rubber gloves when cleaning with this solution. Be sure to rinse
   your walls and furniture with clear warm water and dry thoroughly after
   washing them with this solution.

   Wash a small area at one time, working from the floor up. Then rinse
   the wall with clear water immediately. Ceilings should be washed last.

   Do not repaint until walls and ceilings are completely dry
   .

   Your wallpaper can also be repaired. Use a commercial paste to repaste
   a loose edge or section. Contact your wallpaper dealer or installer for
   information on wallpaper cleaners. Washable wallpaper can be cleansed
   like any ordinary wall, but care must be taken not to soak the paper.
   Work from bottom to top to prevent streaking.

   Wood Furniture


   bed.gif (17492 bytes)

   >
   Do not dry your furniture in the sun. The wood will warp and twist out
   of shape.

   >
   Clear off mud and dirt.

   >
   Remove drawers. Let them dry thoroughly so there will be no sticking
   when you replace them.

   >
   Scrub wood furniture or fixtures with a stiff brush and a cleaning
   solution.

   >
   Wet wood can decay and mold, so dry thoroughly. Open doors and windows
   for good ventilation. Turn      on your furnace or air conditioner, if
   necessary.

   >
   If mold forms, wipe the wood with a cloth soaked in a mixture of borax
   dissolved in hot water.

   >
   To remove white spots or film, rub the wood surface with a cloth soaked
   in a solution of 1/2 cup household ammonia and 1/2 cup water. Then wipe
   the surface dry and polish with wax or rub the surface with a cloth
   soaked in a solution of 1/2 cup turpentine and 1/2 cup linseed oil. Be
   careful - turpentine is combustible.

   You can also rub the wood surface with a fine grade steel wool pad
   dripped in liquid polishing wax, clean the area with a soft cloth and
   then buff.

   Money Replacement

                                                           money.GIF (4738
   bytes)

   Handle burned money as little as possible. Attempt to encase each bill
   or portion of a bill in plastic wrap for preservation. If money is only
   half-burned or less (if half or more is still in tact), you can take
   the remainder to your regional Federal Reserve Bank for replacement.
   Ask your bank for the nearest one. Or you can mail the burned or torn
   money by "registered mail, return receipt requested" to:

   Department of the Treasury
   Bureau of Engraving and Printing
   Office of Currency Standards
   P.O. Box 37048
   Washington, DC  20013

   Mutilated or melted coins can be taken to your regional Federal Reserve
   Bank or mailed by "registered mail, return receipt requested" to:

   Superintendent
   U.S. Mint
   P.O. Box 400
   Philadelphia, PA 19105

   If your U.S. Savings Bonds have been destroyed or mutilated, you must
   obtain Department of Treasury Form PD F 1048 (I) from your bank or
   www.ustreas.gov and mail to:

   Department of the Treasury
   Bureau of Public Debt
   Saving Bonds Operations
   P.O. Box 1328 Parkersburg, WV 26106-1328

   Tax Information

   Check with an accountant, tax consultant or the Internal Revenue
   Service (IRS) about special benefits for people with limited financial
   needs after a fire loss.

   A WORD ABOUT FIRE DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS

   Common Questions

   Q.
   Why are windows broken or holes cut in the roof?

   As a fire burns, it moves upward then outward. Breaking the windows
   and/or cutting holes in the roof (called ventilation) slows the
   damaging outward movement, helps remove blinding smoke that obscures
   the actual fire, and enables firefighters to fight the fire more
   efficiently. The result of this action is less damage to the structure
   in the long run.

   Q.
   Why are holes cut in walls?

   This is done so that the fire department is absolutely sure that the
   fire is completely out, and that there is no fire inside the walls or
   other hidden places.

   Q.
   Is it possible to obtain a copy of the fire report?

   In most localities, a fire report is a public document and is available
   at the fire department or fire marshal’s office

                                                        .

   United States Fire Administration
   16825 South Seton Avenue
   Emmitsburg, Maryland 21727
   Phone (301) 447-1000

   www.usfa.fema.gov

   The following checklist serves as a quick reference and guide for you
   to follow after a fire strikes.
    1. Contact your local disaster relief service, such as The Red Cross,
       if you need temporary housing, food and medicines.
    2. If you are insured, contact your insurance company for detailed
       instructions on protecting the property, conducting inventory and
       contacting fire damage restoration companies. If you are not
       insured, try contacting private organizations for aid and
       assistance.
    3. Check with the fire department to make sure your residence is safe
       to enter. Be watchful of any structural damage caused by the fire.
    4. The fire department should see that utilities are either safe to
       use or are disconnected before they leave the site. DO NOT attempt
       to reconnect utilities yourself.
    5. Conduct an inventory of damaged property and items. Do not throw
       away any damaged goods until after an inventory is made.
    6. Try to locate valuable documents and records. Refer to information
       on contacts and the replacement process inside this brochure.
    7. If you leave your home, contact the local police department to let
       them know the site will be unoccupied.
    8. Begin saving receipts for any money you spend related to fire loss.
       The receipts may be needed later by the insurance company and for
       verifying losses claimed on income tax.
    9. Notify your mortgage company of the fire.
   10. Check with an accountant or the Internal Revenue Service about
       special benefits for people recovering from fire loss.
