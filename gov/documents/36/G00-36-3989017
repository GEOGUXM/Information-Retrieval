   Visiting Scientist Program

   The National Center for Electron Microscopy (NCEM) offers a fellowship
   program allowing participants an opportunity to conduct research and
   use the facility's advanced transmission electron microscopes.

   This program is primarily intended for recently-appointed
   faculty/investigator electron microscopists, resident in the U.S. or
   Mexico who:

   are in the process of setting up new facilities or awaiting delivery of
                               new equipment;

    could benefit from use of unique instrumentation and interaction with
                               staff at NCEM.


   Other post-doctoral applicants with suitable experience and graduate
   students at an advanced stage of thesis work will also be considered.
   Fellowship awards are based on the recommendations of NCEM's Steering
   Committee.

   Research conducted on a Visiting Scientist Fellowship should be
   completed within one year of the award. Each fellowship award will be
   supported up to a maximum of $6,000. Levels of support for each
   fellowship will be determined by NCEM. Award funds are to be used only
   to assist with travel and living expenses during the visit period.

   The twice-yearly deadlines for applications are March 15 and September
   15. For more information, please contact:
