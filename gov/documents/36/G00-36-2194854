    [1. The EE-IR Center e-Newsletter]

   Welcome to the first issue of our monthly Energy & Environmental
   Information Resources e-Newsletter. The purpose of this publication is
   to keep you informed on our activities, and to highlight and analyze
   digital resources.

    [2. Follow-up report on November Advisory Board meeting]

   During the morning of 16 November 1998, EE-IR Center partners conducted
   an Advisory Board meeting. In the afternoon, our partners at the
   NASA/USL Regional Applications Center led a spatial data inventory
   workshop. The NWRC and USL PowerPoint presentations, and the subsequent
   reports are available on the EE-IR Center Web site at:
   http://eeirc.nwrc.gov/1116.htm.

   In future editions of the EE-IR Center e-Newsletter we will be
   reporting in more detail on the data and software issues discussed that
   day.
