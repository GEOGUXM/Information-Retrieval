              _____________________________________________________

       #1 - How do I get a small business loan?
       Documentation requirements may vary; contact your lender for
       information you must supply. Common requirements include: purpose
       of the loan, history of the business, financial statements for
       three years (existing businesses), schedule of term debts (existing
       businesses), aging of accounts receivable and payable (existing
       businesses), projected opening-day balance sheet (new businesses),
       lease details, amount of investment in the business by the
       owner(s), projections of income, expenses and cashflow, signed
       personal financial statements and personal resume(s). You should
       take the information, including your loan proposal and submit it to
       a local lender. If the lender is unable to approve your loan, you
       may ask if the lender can consider your request under the SBA loan
       guaranty program. Under this program, the SBA can guaranty up to
       85% of a small business loan; however, the lender must agree to
       loaning the money with the SBA guarantee. The lender will then
       forward your loan application and a credit analysis to the nearest
       SBA District Office. After receiving all documentation, the SBA
       analyzes the entire application, then makes its decision. The
       process may take up to 10 days to complete. If the lender needs SBA
       applications and/or guidance it may contact the nearest SBA
       District Office by going to http://www.sba.gov/regions/states.html.
       Upon SBA approval, the lending institution closes the loan and
       disburses the funds.
       To be eligible, a business must be operated for profit and not
       exceed SBA's size standards (please go to http://www.sba.gov/size
       for more information). For further information and eligibility
       requirements, please go to www.sba.gov and click on "financing."

       #2 - How do I get a small business grant?
       At this time, Congress has not set aside any monies for grants to
       start and/or expand a small business. For more information on
       grants, please go to http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html.
       SBA does provide a loan guaranty program for loans made by your
       local lender. The SBA guarantees loans that the lender could not
       normally approve. However, all funding is handled through your
       local lender.
       For information on this program and ALL of SBA's financial
       assistance, please go to http://www.sba.gov/financing.

       #7 – What type of collateral do I need for a loan?
       Repayment ability from the cash flow of the business is a primary
       consideration in the SBA loan decision process but good character,
       management capability, collateral, and owner's equity contribution
       are also important considerations. All owners of twenty percent
       (20%) or more of the business are required to personally guarantee
       SBA loans.
       The SBA does not deny approval for a SBA Guaranty Loan solely due
       to lack of collateral; however, it can be used as a reason, in
       addition to, other credit factors.
       For more information on requirements on a SBA Guaranty Loan, as
       well as, our guaranty loan programs available, please visit us at

       #9 – What classifies a business as "small"?
       There is no "official" certification process to be determined as a
       small business. It is a self-certifying and paperless procedure.
       The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) uses the North
       American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) in determining
       size standards; which as of October 1, 2000, replaced the Standard
       Industrial Classification (SIC) Codes. To see if your business is
       considered small by the federal government, or to determine which
       NAICS Code(s) is applicable to your business, please go to
       http://www.sba.gov/size. Also see
       http://www.sba.gov/certifications/.

                                   To Top
       #10 – How can I get my business certified as a woman or minority
       owned?
       On a Federal level, Congress considers a minority-owned business as
       generally anyone other than white. The business must be owned and
       at least 51% controlled by one or more minorities. Women are not
       considered minorities. It is a self-certifying process and no
       paperwork needs to be filled out.
       However, your state and local government may have different rules
       and regulations regarding their contracts and what their
       definitions are. Consult your state and local government for rules
       and requirements.
       The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has a certification
       process for the 8(a) Business Development Program. This program
       assists in the development of small companies owned and operated by
       individuals who are socially and economically disadvantaged.
       Businesses eligible for this program may receive federal
       contracting set-asides and other business-development support to
       help the company gain access to the economic mainstream. To learn
       more about this program, please go to http://www.sba.gov/MED/.
       There is a certification process to be considered a Small
       Disadvantaged Business (SDB). The SDB certification ensures that
       small businesses are owned and controlled by socially and
       economically disadvantaged individuals meeting SDB eligibility
       criteria. If you are considered a SDB, you may receive a price
       evaluation credit of up to 10% when you bid on a federal contract.
       For more information on this program, please go to:
       http://www.sba.gov/sdb
       Also, the HUBZone Empowerment Contracting Program encourages
       economic development in historically underutilized business zones,
       through the establishment of federal contract award preferences for
       small businesses located in such areas. To learn more about this
       program, please go to https://eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/.
       Also see http://www.sba.gov/certifications/.
       #11 What type of interest rate, terms and fees does the SBA require
       on its Guaranty Loan Program?
       Your loan-repayment schedule depends on the use of the proceeds and
       the ability of your business to repay. The general terms are five
       to ten years for working capital; and up to 25 years for fixed
       assets such as the purchase or major renovation of real estate or
       the purchase of equipment (not to exceed the useful life of the
       equipment). Both fixed and variable interest rates are available.
       The interest rate is negotiated between the borrower and the
       lender/bank. However, lenders generally may not charge over the
       maximum rate of 2.25 percent over the lowest prime rate for a loan
       with a maturity of less than seven years and 2.75 percent over
       prime for a maturity of seven years or longer. For loans under
       $50,000, the lender's rate may be slightly higher.
       #12 How do I find an investor for my business?
       The Small Business Administration's (SBA) ACE-Net Program provides
       an Internet-based, secure listing service for entrepreneurs seeking
       equity financing of $250,000 to $5 million from accredited "angel"
       investors. Using ACE-Net, the angel can negotiate directly with a
       listed company to provide equity capital funding and advice for a
       stake in the entrepreneur's corporation. ACE-Net is operated as a
       partnership between the SBA's Office of Advocacy and a number of
       non-profit organizations nationwide. It will ultimately be turned
       over to a private non-profit organization. You can access ACE-Net
       at http://www.sba.gov/ADVO/acenet.html.
       Also, the Small Business Investment Company Program (SBIC) fills
       the gap between the availability of venture capital and the needs
       of small start-up or growing business. Licensed and regulated by
       the SBA, SBICs are privately owned and managed investment companies
       that make capital available to small businesses through investments
       or loans. They use their own funds plus funds obtained at favorable
       rates with SBA guaranties. SBICs are for-profit companies whose
       incentive is to share in the success of small businesses. In
       addition to equity capital and long-term loans, SBICs provide
       debt-equity investments and management assistance. To learn more
       about this program, please go to http://www.sba.gov/INV.
       #13 What is PRO-Net and SUB-Net?
       PRO-Net is an online database of information on thousands of small
       businesses and serves as a search engine for contracting officers,
       a marketing tool for small companies, and a "link" to procurement
       opportunities and other important information. It also provides
       links to the online Commerce Business Daily, federal agency home
       pages and other sources of procurement opportunities. It offers
       free registration to small businesses. Simply access the PRO-Net
       web site at http://pro-net.sba.gov and follow the instructions.
       Trouble calls or problems with logins should be addressed to (202)
       205-7312/7325 or Fax 202 205-7324.
       SUB-Net, an extension of PRO-Net, is primarily for prime
       contractors to post subcontracting opportunities. These
       opportunities may or may not be reserved for small businesses. They
       may include solicitations or other notices, such as a search for
       "teaming" partners and/or subcontractors for future contracts. The
       SUB-Net site enables small businesses to use their limited
       resources to identify and bid on concrete, tangible opportunities.
       While the web site is designed primarily as a place for large
       businesses to post solicitations and notices, federal agencies,
       state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, colleges and
       universities, and small businesses can also use it for the same
       purpose. You can access SUB-Net through the PRO-Net home page by
       choosing the "Subcontracting Opportunities" button. Or, you can go
       directly to SUB-Net at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/
