   OSM Seal Coal mining and reclamation under the Surface Mining Law

   This page briefly describes the "cover photo" used on the Office of
   Surface Mining home page. The page changes weekly and briefly
   highlights a range of subjects related to coal mining and reclamation
   operating under the Surface Mining Law. When the captioned photos are
   replaced they are archived in the Photo Library for future use. The
   photographs this week show coal mine reclamation on prime farmland at
   an award winning Indiana site.

   Removing soil before mining begins
   [photo126S.GIF] Prime farmland topsoil and subsoil is handled with
   special care by using spreading techniques that minimize compaction
   that would hinder root penetration and water absorption by new
   seedlings. At this active Indiana coal mine the topsoil and subsoil
   were removed using hydraulic shovels and haul trucks. The segregated
   soil was immediately hauled back to the reclamation area, dumped, and
   graded. This equipment combined with the direct haul-back method,
   reduces compaction, a serious problem in valuable prime farmland soil.

   Proper handling of the soil is critical to successful reclamation
   [photo298s.gif] Topsoil removal and handling are especially critical in
   the Midwest where prime farmland must be restored to its former
   productivity level. After the final grading of spoil, the topsoil at
   this site was hauled to the reclamation area and spread evenly over the
   land by bulldozers. The mining company replaced all the soil to prime
   farmland depths (40 inches), even though much of the acreage was
   classified non-prime farmland where soils could have been replaced at
   the 12-inch depth required for non-prime farmland. However, the
   operator's commitment to extra soil replacement has restored the land
   to a level capable of supporting a wide variety of current and future
   agricultural uses. Enlarged Photo (16 KB file)

   Crops grown on the reclaimed land have high yields
   [photo297s.gif] The success of this soil handling method can be
   measured by the land's crop productivity. Crops grown on this reclaimed
   farmland have consistently been above the required yields and the land
   is indistinguishable from the surrounding Southern Indiana landscape.
