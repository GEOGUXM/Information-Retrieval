   Forestry Incentives Program

   Introduction
        The 1996 Farm Bill extends the Forestry Incentives Program (FIP),
   which was originally authorized in 1978, to share up to 50 percent of
   the costs of tree planting, timber stand improvements and related
   practices on nonindustrial private forest lands.
        FIP’s forest maintenance and reforestation provide numerous
   natural resource benefits, including reduced wind and soil erosion and
   enhanced water quality and wildlife habitat as well as helping to
   assure a reliable future supply of timber. Improving timber stands,
   which help to sequester greenhouse gases, also contributes to the
   President’s Climate Change initiative.
        FIP is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA)
   Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and Forest Service. In
   Arkansas, the Arkansas Forestry Commission (AFC) serves as the local
   agent for the Forest Service.

   Program Availability
        FIP is a nationwide program available in all counties in Arkansas.
   Federal cost-share money is available to eligible applicants for up to
   50 percent of the costs of installing approved practices. Approval is
   based on certain eligibility criteria and congressional funding. There
   is a maximum payment limitation of $7,500 per person per year.

   FIP-Preparing To Meet the Demand
        FIP is intended to assure the nation’s ability to meet future
   demand for sawtimber, pulpwood and quality hardwoods by planting more
   trees and placing more forest land under good forest management.
        FIP’s cost sharing for these measures helps eligible private
   landowners, whose small parcels represent the majority of the nation’s
   forest lands.
        To be eligible for cost-share assistance under FIP, a landowner
   must:
        q Own no more than 1,000 acres of eligible forest land. In the
   public interest, the secretary of Agriculture can grant an exception
   for larger acreages;
        q Be a private landowner of a nonindustrial forest. Individuals,
   groups, associations or corporations whose stocks are not publicly
   traded may be eligible for FIP provided they are not primarily engaged
   in the business of manufacturing forest products or providing public
   utility services;
        q Have land that is suitable for conversion from nonforest land
   into forest land (afforestation); for reforestation; or for improved
   forest management; and
        q Have land that is capable of producing marketable timber crops
   and meets minimum productivity standards established for FIP. At least
   five acres of eligible forest land is required for FIP.

   Available practices under FIP are:
        q Tree planting;
        q Improving a stand of forest trees; and
        q Site preparation for natural regeneration.

        The AFC provides technical advice in developing a forest
   management plan and helps find approved vendors, if needed, for
   completing the FIP work. In addition, the AFC must certify that the
   practice has been completed satisfactorily before cost-share payments
   can be made.

   For More Information
        Additional information is available from NRCS, Forest Service,
   Farm Service Agency, the Cooperative Extension Service, AFC or your
   local conservation district.
