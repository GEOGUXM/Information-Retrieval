Welcome!


   It is our pleasure to welcome you to this global web service on
   integrated coastal management (ICM), a cooperative undertaking among
   the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, UNESCO, the National
   Ocean Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the
   Center for the Study of Marine Policy (University of Delaware), and the
   World Bank, in conjunction with a number of other partners around the
   world. Although there are many web services that provide information on
   various aspects of integrated coastal management, we saw the need to
   create a web site exclusively devoted to developments and advances in
   ICM at the international, regional, and national levels. As you can see
   by consulting the site index, we will strive to provide timely and
   accurate information on the following:
     * definitions of basic concepts in ICM (ICM Basic section);
     * an overview of global and regional information on ICM (Global and
       Regional Information)
     * national profiles of what various countries are doing on ICM, with
       country contacts (National Profiles);
     * the text of specific national coastal and ocean laws (Coastal Laws)
     * examples of specific ICM problems (such as beach management) with
       guidance on resources for addressing those problems (Problems and
       Case Studies);
     * resources for ICM practitioners -- here we provide the actual text
       for the major international guidelines which have been prepared on
       ICM (such as the World Bank's) (International Guidelines),
       summarize the ICM-related provisions of major international
       agreements (International Prescription), information on education
       and training in the field (Education and Training), and a list of
       ICM publications (Publications);
     * feature new developments on ICM from the international, regional,
       and national levels (News);
     * Feature notices of forthcoming meetings and summaries of the
       outcome of past meetings
     * links to relevant organizations and groups in the field (Links)

   We earnestly solicit your cooperation to make this web service succeed.
   We look forward to receiving your comments, questions, and information
   on ICM developments in your region.
