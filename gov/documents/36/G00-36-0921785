   International Programs Expands Cyber Presence to HighwayInterchange.com

      The FHWA Office of International Programs spearheads the agency's
      international technology exchange efforts. Visitors to
      HighwayInterchange.com will now be able to find some of the Office of
      International Programs technical reports, including:
        * Innovative Traffic Control Technology and Practice in Europe
        * Geotechnical Engineering Practices in Canada and Europe

      Highway-related businesses looking to expand their markets overseas
      will benefit from downloading
        * Doing Business Internationally: A Resource Guide for the
          Transportation Industry

      The Office of International Programs expects to update their
      HighwayInterchange.com Business Center regularly with new informational
      products for the transportation professional interested in highway
      developments around the world.

      The Office Director, Mr. King Gee, noted that "The Office of
      International Programs sees its participation with
      HighwayInterchange.com as one of the many ways in which we can reach as
      many audiences as possible with our information products. It is another
      form of public-private partnership that helps the transportation
      industry leverage and share its huge knowledge base. This is just the
      tip of the iceberg of what the World Wide Web can do to help us get our
      information out and to pull knowledge in."

      Mr. Donovan Beauchamp, President of HighwayInterchange.com, said "The
      information products and services available from FHWA's Office of
      International Programs give the visitor to HighwayInterchange.com a
      broader view of what is happening in various highway disciplines in
      many countries. We intend to expand our international content and
      presence with partners and visitors from around the world."

      HighwayInterchange.com was launched in March 2000. It is a venture of
      Avalon Integrated Services, an e-business consulting firm specializing
      in the transportation industry, based in Arlington, VA.
