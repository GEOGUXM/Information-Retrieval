   Aviation Security (AMA-700)

   The FAA Civil Aviation Security mission is to protect the U.S.
   traveling public in air transportation throughout the world and provide
   for the integrity of the civil aviation system. This mission is carried
   out by developing and implementing regulatory policies, programs and
   procedures to:

   1. Prevent criminal and other disruptive acts against civil aviation;

   2. Conduct investigations and internal security activities in support
   of FAA activities;

   3. Assist in the interdiction of dangerous drugs and narcotics into the
   United States;

   4. Support the national security.

   The Aviation Security Training division is responsible for training the
   FAA aviation security inspectors, security specialists, and
   investigators who are responsible for overseeing airport and air
   carrier security programs, and the security of FAA facilities and
   equipment. Courses cover the full range of security measures for
   aviation.
