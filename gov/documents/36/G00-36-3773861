             The primary objective of the STS-72 mission is to capture and
             return to Earth a Japanese microgravity research spacecraft
             known as Space Flyer Unit (SFU). The 7,885lbs SFU spacecraft was
             launched by Japan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA)
             from Tanegashima Space Center in Japan at 8:01 UT on March 18,
             1995 aboard a Japanese H-II rocket (HII-3).

             The STS-72 mission will also deploy (for about 50 hours) and
             then retrieve the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology
             Flyer (OAST-Flyer) spacecraft. OAST-Flyer is the seventh in a
             series of missions aboard reuseable free-flying Spartan
             carriers. It consists of four experiments: Return Flux
             Experiment (REFLEX), Global Positioning System Attitude
             Determination and Control Experiment (GADACS), Solar Exposure to
             Laser Ordnance Device (SELODE) and the University of Maryland
             Spartan Packet Radio Experiment (SPRE).

             Other experiments onboard STS-72 include the Shuttle Solar
             Backscatter Ultraviolet Experiment (SSBUV-8) (previously flown
             on STS-34, STS-41, STS-43,
             STS-45, STS-56, STS-62 and STS-66), EDFT-03, Shuttle Laser
             Altimeter Payload (SLA-01/GAS(5)), VDA-2, National Institutes of
             Health NIH-R3 Experiment, Space Tissue Loss Experiment
             (STL/NIH-C), Pool Boiling Experiment (PBE) (hardware previously
             flown on STS-47, STS-57 and STS-60) and the Thermal Energy
             Storage (TES-2) experiment (previously flown on STS-69).

             Get Away Special payloads include the United States Air Force
             Academy G-342 Flexible Beam Experiment (FLEXBEAM-2), Society of
             Japanese Aerospace Companies' G-459 - Protein Crystal Growth
             Experiment and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory GAS Ballast Can
             with Sample Return Experiment.

             Endeavour's 10th flight also includes two 6.5 hour spacewalks by
             three astronauts to test hardware and tools that will be used in
             the assembly of the International Space Station starting in late
             1997. EVA-1 on flight day five consists of Crewmembers Leroy
             Chiao (EV1) and Dan Barry (EV2) while EVA-2 on Flight Day 7
             consists of Leroy Chiao (EV1) and Winston Scott (EV2).

   Launch:

             Launch January 11, 1996 at 4:41:00.072 EST (23 min into the
             beginning of the window). Launch window was 49 min 30sec and
             extended until 5:07:30 a.m. EST. The exact length of the window
             was calculated based on the location of the Japanese Space Flyer
             Unit prior to launch. (Reference KSC Press Release 1-96).
             Transoceanic Abort Site (TAL) was at Ben Guerir, Morocco.

             The countdown started on time at 7:30 am in Firing Room 1 of the
             Launch Control Complex (LCC) at the T-43 hour mark. The
             astronaut crew landed at the Shuttle Landing Facility at 9:30am
             on 1/8/96 (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 1/08/1996). The
             countdown included 25 hours and 48 minutes of built-in holds.
             (Reference KSC Press Release 2-96). The countdown went smoothly
             with only a few minor facility or Ground Servicing Equipment
             (GSE) problems. Noise was noted on a UPS fan and oil bearing
             temperature on LOX Pump 126 ran slightly higher than expected.
             No corrective action was necessary. Just before the hold at the
             T-20 minute mark, the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME) were
             running a little cool so GN2 flow was adjusted. There were also
             some communications problems that caused minor launch delays,
             one with MILA and one with the new JSC front end processor. MILA
             switched to a backup system and JSC switched to the old front
             end processor system.

   Landing:

             KSC, Saturday, January 20, 1996 2:41:41 A.M. EST Runway 15
             (southwest to northeast). Sonic Booms heard at KSC at 2:39 A.M.
             EST while Endeavour was at 26,000ft. At 16,000 ft, Endeavour was
             8nm from the Shuttle Landing Facility and traveling at 400 miles
             per hour. At 2:41 A.M. EST, Endeavour was at 9,000ft and 5 nm.
             Preflare was done at 700ft altitude. Unofficial Main Gear
             touchdown at 2:41:41 AM EST, (MET 8 days, 22 hrs, 00 min, 41
             sec). Nose wheel touchdown at 2:41:54 AM EST (MET 8 days 22 hrs
             00 min 54sec) and wheels stop at 2:42:47 (MET 8 days 22 hrs
             01min 47 sec). KSC Weather conditions at the time of landing
             were acceptable (Reference KSC Weather History 01/20/1996 0200).
             Two landing opportunities were available for Saturday at the
             Kennedy Space Center for Endeavour's homecoming. The first
             opportunity was used which called for a firing of Endeavour's
             braking rockets at 12:41 a.m. Saturday and a touchdown on Runway
             33 at the Shuttle Landing Facility. The second landing
             opportunity was not needed but would have been about one hour
             and a half later with a landing at 4:17 a.m. EST.
