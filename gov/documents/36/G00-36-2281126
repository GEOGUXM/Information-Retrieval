   computer research

   Scientific computing, including modeling and simulation, has become
   crucial for research problems that are insoluble by traditional
   theoretical and experimental approaches, hazardous to study in the
   laboratory, or time-consuming or expensive to solve by traditional
   means.                         . . . more arrow
