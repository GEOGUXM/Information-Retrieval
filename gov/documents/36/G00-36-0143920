   Deep subsurface ice is where exciting scientific investigations at both
   terrestrial and
   planetary sites are found. To advance that science, we propose to
   address the development of robotic vehicles to support subsurface
   exploration in continental-scale ice masses like those on Earth, Mars,
   and Europa. These robotic systems will be relevant to such scientific
   objectives as studying Earth's past climatic circulation, Antarctic
   geophysics, ice dynamics science, Europa ocean and ice in-situ
   exploration, Titan prebiotic exploration, and Mars polar cap
   exploration, climate history science, and exobiology science. The mix
   of strong Earth and planetary science interests is crucial in supplying
   testing opportunities at terrestrial sites for robotic systems to be
   used in planetary applications with costs shared among agencies and
   programs. In the past, ice vehicles have been attempted and they were
   unsatisfactory.

   The old systems of ice melting were passively thermal; a hot object
   melted its way through ice using gravity's force. The newer systems,
   such as hot water drilling (active drilling) rely on hot water being
   forced against a melting front so that there is an enhanced heat
   exchange as well as the sweeping away of granular material. The
   Integrated Cryobot Experimental (ICE) Probe is a combination of passive
   and active melt systems. This combination should address any of the a
   fore principal problems with melt systems, modern techniques of
   micro-fluids, monitoring, telemetering, and better control will aid in
   improving design elements.

   The Cryobot is a tool designed to penetrate the ice by melting it. The
   Cryobot will take measurements of the encountered environment, and
   sending the collected data or image to the surface of the ice. Thus the
   requirements of the Cryobot's design are numerous. For planetary
   exploration it is essential to design a probe that is small and light
   on energy. The probe has also to resist low temperatures, an oceanic
   environment and high pressure.

   The future Cryobot will be 1.5 meter long (for Earth applications) and
   10cm in diameter and a weigh about 40 kg. The probe will melt down into
   the ice using the force of gravity to maintain vertical orientation.
   For Earth missions, the probe will be powered electrically, but for the
   future planetary missions, it is likely that energy will be provided by
   other sources. Providing energy to and communicating with probe through
   ice and water is not a simple engineering problem. Scientists and
   engineers from NASA-JPL have developed the following solution.
   Terrestrially, a wire spool will be set at the rear of the Cryobot so
   that it can be connected to the surface. A tether is also viable for
   Mars, but a Europa deployment would require ice transceivers.

   The examination of the encountered environment will be performed by an
   in situ chemical
   laboratory (ISiCL). ISiCl could test concentrations of H[2] (Hydrogen),
   H[2]S (Hydrogen Sulfide), CH (Methane) and CO[2] (Carbon Dioxide), pH
   (Potential of Hydrogen) and redox potential. A UV detector could also
   be added to analyze organic compounds and perform microscopic DNA
   fluorescence. The Cryobot probe may also carry a Hydrobot to explore
   liquid environments such as Lake Vostok and EuropaÂ’s hypothesized
   ocean. The Hydrobot will have its own instrumentation suite to
   characterize the aquatic environment. Potential instrumentation might
   include a hydrophone to detect volcanism, temperature measurements,
   salinity and conductivity measurements, a current meter, a sonar imager
   for navigation and mapping, and a visible imaging system.


   Our concept for the development of technology for remote operations in
   deep ice is consistent with future mission planning for NASA Earth
   Enterprise (ESE), NASA Human Exploration and Development of Space
   (HEDS), and NASA Office of Space Science (OSS).
