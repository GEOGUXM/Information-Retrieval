  San Francisco Bay Ecology and Related Habitats

   Published September 2001

   San Francisco Bay, the largest estuary along the Pacific shore of North
   and South America, sustains nearly 500 species of fish, invertebrates,
   birds, mammals, insects and amphibians. Two thirds of the state's
   salmon pass through the Bay and Delta, as do nearly half of the
   waterfowl and shorebirds migrating along the Pacific Flyway. The Bay is
   a vital part of a natural community of organisms spanning from upland
   areas to deep water and is a natural resource of incalculable value.

   The purpose of this report is to provide the foundation for the update
   of the Bay Plan findings and policies that protect the Bay's habitats
   and wildlife. The report contains information on the ecology of San
   Francisco Bay, including the diversity of habitats associated with the
   Bay, the assemblages of plant and animal life dependent upon those
   habitats, and the principal threats affecting the well-being of the
   Bay's ecosystem.

     This document is currently in hardcopy only. Work is underway to
     create an on-line version.
     Please contact Commission planning staff to obtain a copy.

  Nonpoint Source Pollution Report and Proposed Work Program

   Published August 2001

   Everyday activities often leave a variety of pollutants on the ground,
   from motor oil and grease on city streets, to gardening fertilizer,
   pesticides, and sediment from construction and new development. When it
   rains, the storm water carries these pollutants to storm drains,
   creeks, wetlands, groundwater basins, and, ultimately, to the San
   Francisco Bay. This polluted runoff (also called nonpoint source
   pollution, or NPS) can damage waterways and wetland habitats, harm or
   kill fish and wildlife, and make water bodies unsuitable for
   recreation. Polluted runoff is considered one of the top threats to the
   Bay's ecological health, and may account for a considerable proportion
   of the Bay's total pollutant load.

   The purpose of this report is to help the Commission review and analyze
   the Commission's existing pollution control authority and efforts, to
   identify areas where more Commission efforts may be appropriate, and to
   identify additional strategies to reduce and prevent pollutants from
   potential sources.

  Public Access and Wildlife Compatibility

   Published March 2001

   The Commission is charged with both protecting the Bay's wildlife
   resources and with increasing the public's access to and along the Bay.
   Over the last 30 years, the Commission's policies on public access have
   evolved in recognition of the need to balance public access with the
   protection and enhancement of wildlife habitat. However, concern over
   this issue continues to grow. The demand for outdoor water-oriented
   experiences and expanding shoreline development have clearly elevated
   the potential for interaction between public and wildlife use of many
   shoreline areas. Consequently, as part of the Commission's work plan
   for updating the Bay Plan, Commission staff initiated a study of the
   compatibility of public access and wildlife.

   The purpose of this report is to provide background information
   supporting the revision of the San Francisco Bay Plan public access
   findings and polices. Chapter 1 describes in detail the history of BCDC
   policy development in regards to public access and wildlife
   compatibility issues. Chapter 2 describes what is known about the
   biological effects of public access on wildlife. Chapter 3 provides
   information on siting, design and management strategies to avoid or
   minimize the effects of public access on wildlife. The conclusions of
   the study and adopted revisions to Bay Plan public access findings and
   policies are also included.

   Note: Due to technical difficulties, Appendix E: Public Access and
   Wildlife Compatibility Survey Results is not included in this on-line
   version. Please contact the Commission's planning staff for a hard copy
   if you so desire.

   Appendix G, a collection of photos depicting public access design
   considerations, is available in two forms as a separate download. One
   contains high resolution photos suitable for printing; the file size is
   very large and can take a while to download. The other contains low
   resolution photos suitable for viewing on the Internet; the file size
   is smaller and will download faster.
