           President Bush, Chairman Cox Discuss Economic Security
               Legislation is vital weapon in War on Terrorism

           WASHINGTON (Tuesday, November 27, 2001)—Meeting with President
   Bush this evening at the White House, House Policy Chairman Christopher
   Cox and the House majority leadership agreed that economic security
   legislation must be enacted before year end.
           “The economic slowdown that began in March was well underway on
   September 11,” explained Chairman Cox. “Since then, job losses and a
   further decline in key sectors of our economy have occasioned higher
   federal social spending, while dampening federal tax collections.”
           President Bush and Chairman Cox support moderate tax relief to
   encourage re-hiring workers and to boost the economy.
           “Today, putting Americans back to work is of vital importance
   to winning the War on Terrorism,” said Chairman Cox. “That is why
   President Bush has called on Congress to pass an Economic Security bill
   to reduce the tax burdens on job creation. I urge my colleagues to heed
   his call, and to pass this important legislation before we adjourn.”
           The meeting with the President, which lasted 90 minutes, took
   place in the family residence quarters of the White House. In addition
   to tax legislation, Chairman Cox discussed the progress of the war in
   Afghanistan and on other fronts around the world.
