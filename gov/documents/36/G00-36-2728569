   Government
   GOVERNOR GARY LOCKE'S 2002 supplemental budget proposal reflects the
   realities of recession and war, but its long-term goal is to create a
   leaner, more effective state government that is better prepared to help
   Washington achieve economic recovery and lasting prosperity.

   This budget is a cost-cutting plan that focuses state resources on core
   state services. Tough choices are made. No general tax increase is
   proposed.

   The Governor's proposal invests in Washington's people and their
   future. It responds to the state's rising jobless rate, creating
   thousands of new jobs through urgently needed transportation
   improvements and other construction projects that lay a foundation for
   long-term economic growth. It protects unemployment benefits and
   expands workforce training so people out of a job can get back to work.
