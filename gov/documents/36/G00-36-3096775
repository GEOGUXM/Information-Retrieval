Tentative Recommendations and Other Materials ~

                                        ~ Available for Review and Comment
       Tentative recommendations and other materials, such as background
   studies, are made available so that interested persons will be advised
   of the Commission's tentative conclusions and can make their views
   known to the Commission. Any comments sent to the Commission will be a
   part of the public record and will be considered at a public meeting
   when the Commission determines the provisions it will include in any
   recommended legislation.

       It is just as important to advise the Commission that you approve
   the tentative recommendation as it is to advise us that you believe
   revisions should be made.

       The Commission often substantially revises tentative
   recommendations as a result of the comments it receives. Hence, these
   tentative recommendations are not necessarily the recommendation the
   Commission will submit to the Legislature.

       "Comment period closed" following a tentative recommendation or
   other item indicates that the set period for commenting has expired,
   and more. However, the Commission is always interested to know what you
   think. Even though an item has passed through its tentative
   recommendation phase, there may still be time to submit valuable
   comments before a final recommendation is approved. And after a bill
   has been introduced, the Commission continues to hear and evaluate
   commentary.

  Administrative Law

     * Administrative Rulemaking Refinements
       Comments due January 9, 2002

     Summary: The California Law Revision Commission has previously
     proposed a number of improvements to the law governing rulemaking by
     state administrative agencies. This tentative recommendation
     proposes additional refinements, which include the following:
          + Clarification of the requirement that an agency consider
            reasonable alternatives to a proposed rulemaking action.
          + Clarification of the requirement that an agency designate a
            representative to answer substantive inquiries regarding a
            proposed rulemaking action.
          + Revision of the existing Internet publication requirement, to
            require posting of the text of a proposed emergency rulemaking
            action and to specify when and for how long documents must be
            posted.

  Criminal Law

     * Cases in Which Court Reporter Is Required
       [Comment period closed]

     Summary: This recommendation would consolidate the rules governing
     when a court reporter must be provided in civil and criminal cases.
     Nonsubstantive revisions would also be made to clarify the
     application of the statute, consistent with existing law.

     This recommendation was prepared pursuant to Government Code Section
     70219.

     * Criminal Sentencing: Weapon and Injury Enhancements
       [Comment period closed]

     Summary: The statutes governing felony sentencing have been
     criticized as overly complex and difficult to understand. According
     to a Judicial Council study, errors in sentencing are the single
     greatest cause of reversal on appeal and account for over half of
     the reversals on appeal in criminal cases. Previous attempts at
     reform that involved substantive change to sentence lengths have
     been unsuccessful. The Commission recommends the nonsubstantive
     reorganization of sentence enhancement provisions. This will improve
     the accessibility and comprehensibility of these provisions.

  Debtor-Creditor Law

     * Municipal Bankruptcy (September 2001)
       [Comment period closed]

     Summary: The Law Revision Commission recommends a number of
     revisions to update California statutes authorizing bankruptcy
     filings by local public entities under Chapter 9 of the federal
     Bankruptcy Code. Consistent with the approach historically taken in
     California, the general statute would authorize municipal bankruptcy
     filings to the full extent permissible under federal law, subject to
     any special statutory rules applicable to particular entities.

     The Commission studied broader substantive reforms, including
     proposals to require pre-filing approval by the Governor or a
     governmental committee, and to provide for post-filing review by
     appropriate state authorities. However, there does not appear to be
     any general agreement on the best approach to reform, or even as to
     the need for additional protections or controls. Accordingly, the
     Commission is not recommending any broader substantive reforms at
     this time.

     * Debtor-Creditor Law: Technical Revisions (March 2001)
       [Comment period closed.]

     Summary: This tentative recommendation addresses a number of
     technical issues identified by sheriffs concerning procedures under
     the claim and delivery statute (Code Civ. Proc. § 511.010 et seq.)
     and the Enforcement of Judgments Law (Code Civ. Proc. § 680.010 et
     seq.), both of which were enacted on Commission recommendation.
     Technical revisions should be made to address the problem where
     there is no undertaking given in claim and delivery, the disposition
     of exemption claims ordered off calendar and stays pending final
     determination of exemption claims in enforcement of judgments, and
     notation of the final day to vacate premises under a writ of
     possession.

  Eminent Domain Law

     * Evidence of Prejudgment Deposit Appraisal in Eminent Domain
       [Comment period closed]

     Summary: This recommendation would revise the statutes governing
     evidence of the condemnor's prejudgment deposit appraisal in order
     to:

     (1) Make clear that evidence of the appraisal may be used in
     determining the amount of litigation expenses for which a condemnor
     may be assessed.

     (2) Codify case law that evidence of the appraisal may be used for
     purposes of impeaching a witness who prepared the appraisal.
     (3) Emphasize that the protections against use of prejudgment
     deposit appraisal evidence apply equally to the property owner and
     the condemnor.

  Evidence

     * Electronic Communications and Evidentiary Privileges
       [Comment period closed]

     Summary: The Commission recommends revision of several Evidence Code
     provisions to make clear that (1) a privileged communication does
     not lose its privileged status simply because it is transmitted
     electronically, (2) the statutory presumption of confidentiality and
     statutory waiver requirements apply to newly created privileges, and
     (3) disclosure of a privileged communication waives the privilege
     only where the holder of the privilege intentionally makes the
     disclosure or intentionally permits another person to make the
     disclosure. Evid. Code §§ 912, 917, 952.

     The Commission also solicits suggestions for other reforms needed to
     adapt the Evidence Code for electronic communications.

  Judiciary and Civil Procedure

     * Statutes Made Obsolete by Trial Court Restructuring
       Comments due February 15, 2002

     Summary: In the late 1990's, California's trial court system was
     substantially restructured through state funding of trial court
     operations, trial court unification, and reforms relating to trial
     court employment. As a result, hundreds of statutes are now
     obsolete. The Law Revision Commission proposes amendment or repeal
     of the obsolete provisions to reflect the restructuring of the trial
     court system.

     In addition to the numerous revisions proposed in this
     recommendation, other statutes require amendment or repeal but are
     not included here because stakeholders have not yet reached
     agreement on key issues, further research is necessary in light of
     the complexity of the law, or additional time is required to prepare
     appropriate revisions due to the sheer volume of statutory material
     involved. The Commission will continue its work on statutes made
     obsolete by trial court restructuring with the objective of
     recommending further clean up of the statutes from time to time.

     * Stay of Mechanic's Lien Enforcement Pending Arbitration
       Comments due February 28, 2002

     Summary: Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.5 relates to
     preservation of arbitration rights during mechanic's lien
     enforcement proceedings. This recommendation would amend the
     provision to:

     (1) Delete an obsolete sentence on joinder of a lien claim within
     the jurisdiction of the municipal court.

     (2) Simplify the procedure for preserving arbitration rights and
     obtaining a stay pending arbitration, thereby reducing litigation
     expenses and conserving judicial resources.

     * Appellate and Writ Review Under Trial Court Unification
       Comments due March 31, 2002

     Summary: The Law Revision Commission recommends that the superior
     court's appellate division be converted into a division of limited
     jurisdiction in the court of appeal. The new court of appeal
     division would function in much the same manner that the superior
     court appellate division functions. It would be staffed by superior
     court judges sitting by assignment and would hear cases in the
     counties in which they arise.

     Under this proposal, the jurisdiction of the new division would not
     necessarily be misdemeanor, infraction, and limited civil cases. The
     court of appeal would control its own workload by assigning
     appropriate cases for resolution in the limited jurisdiction
     division.
     Such a scheme offers a number of advantages over the dual appellate
     structure of existing law, in which jurisdiction is split between
     the court of appeal and the appellate division of the superior
     court:

     (1) It would mitigate the undesirable situation of a superior court
     reviewing its own judgments and even issuing writs to itself.

     (2) It would enable the court of appeal to control its workload by
     appropriate assignment of cases. A problematic constitutional
     provision that preserves the jurisdiction of the court of appeal in
     causes within its appellate jurisdiction on June 30, 1995, would be
     repealed as unnecessary.
     (3) It would centralize filings in the court of appeal and eliminate
     the need to transfer or dismiss an appeal filed in the wrong court.

     * Civil Discovery Background Study
       Comments due December 31, 2001

     Summary: The Commission is undertaking a study of whether discovery
     procedures in other jurisdictions are appropriate models for
     improvement of civil discovery practice in California. In connection
     with this study, the Commission seeks public comment on a newly
     released background study relating to discovery developments in
     other jurisdictions.

     The background study was prepared for the Commission by Professor
     Gregory S. Weber of McGeorge School of Law. It describes innovations
     that apply to discovery generally, such as mandatory pretrial
     disclosure, narrowed discovery relevance, mandatory discovery
     planning, certification of good faith in conducting discovery, and
     increased judicial control over discovery. The background study also
     describes reforms that apply to specific discovery devices, such as
     depositions, interrogatories, inspection demands, medical
     examinations, exchange of expert witness information, and requests
     for admissions. The background study is intended help the Commission
     determine the scope, general direction, and priorities for its study
     of civil discovery.

  Probate Law

     * Rules of Construction for Trusts and Other Instruments
       [Comment period closed]

     Summary:The Law Revision Commission has surveyed the existing
     Probate Code rules of construction for wills, trusts, and other
     estate planning instruments. The rules have been criticized in
     recent years as being overly broad.

     The Commission concludes that several of the rules should be limited
     in their application. A number should be repealed because they
     restate the common law (but do so in an incomplete fashion), because
     they duplicate other statutes, or because they unduly inhibit the
     ability of the court to ascertain the donor's intent.
     The Commission recommends further clarifications of existing
     statutes and improvements in terminology, and correction of statutes
     containing obsolete references to former law. The Commission has
     developed official Comments explaining the derivation of, and
     providing other relevant information concerning, the Probate Code
     rules of construction.

  Property Law

     * Consumer Protection Options Under Home Improvement Contracts
       (Discussion Draft)
       Comments due January 11, 2002

     Summary:The Law Revision Commission is studying special protections
     for homeowners who face potential double liability for labor and
     materials under home improvement contracts. This problem arises
     where the owner pays the prime contractor under the terms of their
     contract, but the prime contractor does not pay amounts due to
     subcontractors and equipment and material suppliers, who can then
     enforce their claims against the owner's property or construction
     funds.

     In anticipation of the 2002 legislative session, the Commission is
     seeking comment on two approaches to address the double liability
     issue in home improvement contracts:

     (1) A privity rule, limiting mechanic's lien and stop notice rights
     to claimants who have a contract with the homeowner, coupled with
     recognition of a right for claimants without a contract to seek an
     equitable lien on the owner's property to prevent unjust enrichment.

     (2) A good-faith payment rule, limiting the liability of homeowners
     to the extent they have paid in good faith, but leaving existing
     mechanic's lien and stop notice remedies in place, applicable to
     amounts remaining unpaid.

     Both proposals would apply only to home improvement contracts under
     a certain cap based on the contract price -- most frequently
     mentioned amounts are $10,000 or $25,000. The Commission is
     interested in opinions on the appropriate level for the cap.

     Finally, the Commission is soliciting comment on whether the cap
     should be based on the amount of the individual subcontractor's or
     supplier's contract, rather than the prime contract, and if so, what
     that amount should be.
     The Commission has tabled its tentative recommendation proposing a
     mandatory 50% home improvement contract bond. As a general approach,
     the Commission has concluded that it would be preferable to seek
     simpler solutions that invoke market principles, rather than the
     more complicated statutory rules needed to implement mandatory bond
     and direct payment schemes.

     * The Double Payment Problem in Home Improvement Contracts
       [Comment period closed]

     Summary: The Law Revision Commission recommends special protections
     for homeowners who face potential double liability for labor and
     materials under home improvement contracts. This problem arises
     where the owner pays the prime contractor under the terms of their
     contract, but the prime contractor does not pay amounts due to
     subcontractors and equipment and material suppliers, who can then
     enforce their claims against the owner's property or construction
     funds. The Commission has studied a number of different approaches
     to this problem and settled on limited mandatory bonding, coupled
     with protection for good-faith payments, as the best balance between
     the interests of homeowners, subcontractors, and suppliers and the
     cost of the protections.

     The proposed law would require that prime contractors on home
     improvement contracts obtain a payment bond from a surety insurer in
     the amount of 50% of the contract price to protect unpaid
     subcontractors and suppliers, thereby relieving the homeowner from
     double liability. The home improvement contract would be filed with
     the county recorder and the payment bond would be recorded before
     the home improvement job commences. In essence, this proposal would
     make the optional procedure in Civil Code Section 3235 mandatory for
     home improvement contracts.
     The mandatory 50% bond would not be required for contracts under
     $10,000, in view of the inefficiency of bonding on smaller jobs, but
     blanket payment bonds would be available in the smaller cases.
     Under the $10,000 contract level, and in any case where the prime
     contractor has failed to obtain the required bond, the homeowner
     would be protected from double liability to the extent that payments
     had been made in good faith under the contract. Subcontractors and
     suppliers would easily be able to determine whether the job is
     bonded by reference to the recorder's files or by checking with the
     surety company noted on the contract form.
     The mechanic's lien and stop notice rights of subcontractors and
     suppliers would not be affected to the extent that the homeowner has
     not paid for labor, supplies, equipment, and materials. If a bond
     has been provided, subcontractors and suppliers would also have the
     additional remedy of enforcement against the bond.
     The Commission is also soliciting comment on the desirability of an
     alternative scheme that would simply protect good-faith payments
     under home improvement contracts below $10,000 (or other appropriate
     amount), without providing for a mandatory bond in all home
     improvement contracts.

     * Scope of Study of Laws Affecting Common Interest Developments
       (Background Study)
       [Comment period closed]

     Summary: The California Law Revision Commission seeks public comment
     on a newly-released report relating to revision of the common
     interest development laws. The report was prepared for the
     Commission by Professor Susan F. French of the UCLA Law School. It
     is intended to help the Commission determine the scope, general
     direction, and priorities for its common interest development law
     study.

     The common interest development law study will review the statutes
     affecting common interest developments with the goal of setting a
     clear, consistent, and unified policy with regard to their formation
     and management and the transaction of real property interests
     located within them. It will seek to clarify the law and eliminate
     unnecessary or obsolete provisions, consolidate existing statutes in
     one place in the codes, and determine to what extent common interest
     housing developments should be subject to regulation.
     The Commission will consider comments it receives in determining the
     scope, general direction, and priorities for the common interest
     development law study.
