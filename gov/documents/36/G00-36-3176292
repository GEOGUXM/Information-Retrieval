   WORKSHOP ON RUNTIME VERIFICATION ORGANIZED BY KLAUS HAVELUND AND
   GRIGORE ROSU
   Klaus Havelund and Grigore Rosu organized a workshop in July 2001
   entitled RV 01, the First Workshop on Runtime Verification, held in
   Paris, France. The objective of RV 01 was to bring scientists from
   both academia and industry together to debate on how to monitor,
   analyze and guide the execution of programs. The ultimate longer term
   goal is to investigate whether the use of lightweight formal methods
   applied during the execution of programs is a viable complement to the
   current heavyweight methods proving programs correct always before
   their execution, such as model checking and theorem proving. Dynamic
   program monitoring and analysis can occur during testing or during
   operation.

   proceedings can be found at http://ase.arc.nasa.gov/rv
