                         Campaign Finance Reform Now
                           by Rep. Bernie Sanders

      The Enron Corporation ripped off the pensions of thousands of its
    workers by denying them the ability to sell their Enron stock when it
                               was plummeting.

     Enron ripped off investors by not being honest about the financial
                          condition of the company.

      Enron ripped off ratepayers by manipulating the energy market and
        forcing electrical rates to soar in California and elsewhere.

   Enron ripped off taxpayers by playing fast and loose with the tax code,
     by not paying its fair share of taxes, and by receiving hundreds of
            millions in tax rebates from the federal government.

    Enron is a poster child of how a group of powerful corporate leaders
    come to exert enormous clout over elected officials and get the rules
   changed in their favor. Its growth and decline are a perfect example of
   why we need strong campaign finance reform. Special interests cannot be
     allowed to continue wrecking havoc with our political and economic
                                    life.

    Enron contributed nearly $6 million to both Republicans and Democrats
   over the past year. What did they get for the money they spent then and
   in the past? In four out of the last five years this hugely profitable
    company paid no taxes. In fact, according to The New York Times, they
   received $382 million in tax refunds. Further, if the House Republican
   economic stimulus package ever becomes law, they would receive another
                        $254 million in tax rebates.

    So one thing they got for their money was tax breaks. Not just them,
   but the many wealthy contributors who could afford to pay $2500 a plate
     to have dinner with George Bush. He got elected, and guess what? He
   eliminated the budget surplus, which could have paid down the national
      debt, in order to give huge tax breaks to the wealthy, averaging
   $53,000 annually. Meanwhile for the 78 million taxpayers in the lowest
    60 percent of the income scale, the tax cut will average $347 a year.
   And the House Republican Economic Stimulus package would do even worse
    damage. Over fifty percent of the tax cut would go to the richest one
   percent, those with incomes over $384,000, while the bottom 60 percent
           of taxpayers would get just 7 percent of the tax cuts.

   Enron offered candidate George W. Bush its fleet of corporate jets for
    political travel during the 2000 campaign, and the Chairman of Enron,
      Kenneth Lay and his wife have contributed almost $800,000 to the
                        Republican Party since 1988.

     What did they get for their money? Is it an accident that Enron was
     able to arrange secret meetings with Vice President Cheney to help
   craft the Administrations energy bill?. Is it an accident that the Bush
    Administration refused to help California and other states deal with
    the energy crisis last summer which cost consumers there billions of
           dollars and helped pad the pockets of Enron executives?

    Arthur Andersen, the firm that allowed Enron to overstate its profits
   by some $580 million over the past 4 years, spent more than $5 million
   in campaign contributions to both Republicans and Democrats since 1989.

      What did Arthur Anderson get? The rejection of a proposed rule by
    former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt that would have banned independent
       auditing firms from receiving consultant fees. Last year alone,
    Andersen received $27 million in consulting fees from Enron. In fact,
      while the Big 5 accounting firms were paid $909 million for their
    auditing work last year, they were paid $2.65 billion for consulting
       and other services, a very serious appearance of a conflict of
    interest. Can an auditor be independent and honest when two thirds of
     its income comes not from auditing but from consulting about how to
               take advantage of every legality and loophole?

      But its not just Enron and its not just Arthur Anderson. Campaign
    spending is out of control. The simple truth is that large, powerful
         corporations like Enron should not be allowed to direct the
         policy-making of this nation by virtue of the huge campaign
       contributions they make. Corporate financing of campaigns, huge
       political donations by the wealthy, are severely impacting our
     democratic way of life. Who will look out for the well-being of the
   average American who does not attend those $25,000 a plate fundraising
                         dinners held in Washington?

   If you can believe it, political parties and candidates spent more than
     $3 billion on the 2000 elections according to data compiled by the
         Center for Responsive Politics. Eighty percent of political
   contributions come from the wealthiest one-quarter of 1 percent of the
                    population. And what are the results?

   At the same time that Americans pay the highest prices for prescription
     drugs of any people in the industrialized world, the pharmaceutical
   industry spent over $180 million in campaign contributions, advertising
                and lobbying during the 1999-2000 elections.

       At the same time that some of the largest companies in America
   including IBM, GE and Chevron were in line for a $25 billion corporate
    welfare check from the House Republican economic stimulus bill, they
      spent over $45 million in campaign contributions over the past 10
                                   years.

        At the same time that 44 million Americans do not have health
     insurance, HMOs, health service providers and the health insurance
   industry spent over $20 million in campaign contributions, advertising
            and public relations during the 1999-2000 elections.

    At the same time that the House Republican energy bill would provide
   $33 billion in tax breaks for energy companies, the energy sector spent
    nearly $65 million in campaign contributions to both major political
                                  parties.

   Clearly, our campaign finance system needs to be fundamentally changed.
    We need to be a nation in which political influence is determined by
     one person, one vote. Not by large corporations and wealthy people
   contributing hundreds of millions to the political party and candidate
                              of their choice.

      As a first step, Congress needs to pass the Shays-Meehan Campaign
      Reform Act as soon as possible. The Senate has already passed the
    similar McCain-Feingold Campaign Reform Bill. Both bills will put an
                      end to soft money contributions.

   The Republican leadership does not want campaign finance reform to come
    to a vote, because they know that people nationwide will demand that
   their legislators pass it. So the House Republican Leadership has used
    every political device, every bit of arm-twisting they can muster, to
    prevent the Shays-Meehan bill from being brought forward for a vote.

   Theres good news, though. The legislation just got four signatures two
   more than were needed on a discharge petition, which requires the House
      to take up Shays-Meehan on the floor instead of allowing it to be
     bottled up in committees. The Republican Hosue leadership is still
           stalling on the date of a floor vote, but it will come.

   It would be a fitting irony if the final result of Enrons huge campaign
   contributions were to bring about campaign finance reform, so that such
                  contributions could never again be made.
