       The SBA Office of International Trade has information regarding how

       services, including market research, export laws, business
       opportunities, trade shows, events, research tools, financing, and

       The number of exporting small businesses has tripled in the last
       decade and in the past five years, the value of small business
       exports has increased 300 percent. Despite this surge in export
       activity, many small businesses continue to have difficulty in
       obtaining export financing. That's why the U.S. Small Business
       Administration has created the SBA Export Express Pilot Loan
       Program. Click here to find out more about this program:
