                             PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT

                          U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
                           Office of the Spokesman

                                 East Timor

                              October 22, 2001

   American citizens traveling to East Timor should exercise caution,
   avoid large gatherings, and remain alert in regard to their personal
   security.

   On August 30, 2001, East Timor held its first election since gaining
   independence from Indonesia in 1999. East Timor will remain under the
   authority of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East
   Timor (UNTAET) until it becomes an independent nation in mid-2002.
   Violence erupted throughout East Timor after the United
   Nations-sponsored independence referendum in 1999. However, under
   United Nations supervision, stability has been reestablished throughout
   the majority of the territory.

   Over the last three months, while the security situation has improved,
   East Timor has continued to experience problems with criminal activity,
   both violent and non-violent. Most of the crime occurs in the capital,
   Dili. Expatriates are sometimes targeted by muggers and burglars.
   Americans are strongly encouraged to exercise caution, particularly at
   night. Americans should not walk alone in Dili at night. Travelers
   should avoid areas along the border between East and West Timor.
   Militia incursions have occurred in the western districts of East
   Timor, and travelers wishing to visit these areas are encouraged to
   consult UN authorities in Dili before departing.

   Travelers to East Timor should be aware that suitable accommodations
   outside of Dili are virtually non-existent.

   All Americans resident or traveling in East Timor are encouraged to
   register with the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta (tel: 62-21-3435-9000), and
   to obtain updated information on the security situation. Registration
   may be completed in person, by fax or through the U.S. Embassy home
   page at http://www.usembassyjakarta.org. Embassy Jakarta currently
   maintains a temporary representative office in Dili, which can provide
   limited emergency services to American citizens. The temporary
   representative office is located in the sea front Farol district of
   Dili, phone 0407-047052 or 0407-324684.

   This Announcement supersedes the Public Announcement for East Timor of
   August 8, 2001, to provide updated information on the security
   situation, and it expires on March 31, 2002.
