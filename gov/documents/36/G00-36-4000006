         The U.S. Agency for International Development is headquartered in
       Washington, D.C. and has field offices in many of the countries where
                                 we have programs.

                                    Leadership

        USAID is headed by an Administrator and Deputy Administrator, both
       appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The agency's
      Administrator is Andrew S. Natsios ; the Acting Deputy Administrator is
                                 Janet Ballantyne.

                                      Bureaus

        In Washington, USAID's major organization units are called bureaus.
      Each bureau houses the staffs responsible for major subdivisions of the
                               agency's activities.

         USAID has both geographic bureaus (which are responsible for the
          overall activities in the countries where we have programs) and
      functional bureaus (that conduct agency programs that are world-wide in
        nature or that cross geographic boundries.) The agency's geographic
                   bureaus -- and the Assistant Administors are:
        * Sub-Saharan Africa (AFR) | Constance B. Newman, Assistant
          Administrator
        * Asia and the Near East (ANE) | Lori A. Forman, Assistant
          Administrator
        * Latin America & the Caribbean (LAC) | J. Michael Deal, Acting
          Assistant Administrator
        * Europe and Eurasia (E&E) | Kent Hill, Assistant Administrator

                          USAID's functional bureaus are:
        * Global Health | Anne Peterson, Assistant Administrator
        * Economic Growth, Agriculture, and Trade | Jonathan Conly, Acting
          Assistant Administrator
        * Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance | Leonard M.
          Rogers, Acting Assistant Administrator

      In addition, certain major headquarters functions are also assigned to
                        bureaus. Headquarters bureaus are:
        * Management (M) | John Marshall, Assistant Administrator
        * Legislative and Public Affairs (LPA) | J. Edward Fox, Assistant
          Administrator
        * Policy and Program Coordination (PPC) | Patrick M. Cronin,
          Assistant Administrator

       Each bureau is headed by an Assistant Administrator, appointed by the
                      President and confirmed by the Senate.

                                Independent Offices

        In addition to these bureaus, USAID has several independent offices
        that carry-out discrete functions for the agency. These offices are
         headed by directors who are appointed by the USAID Administrator.
                         USAID's Independent offices are:
        * Office of the Executive Secretariat (ES) & Chief of Staff | Douglas
          J. Aller
        * Office of Equal Opportunity Programs (EOP) | Jessalyn L. Pendarvis
        * Office of the General Counsel (GC) | John Gardner
        * Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) |
          Laverne Drummond, Acting
        * Office of Security (SEC) | C. Michael Flannery

                                 Inspector General

        The Office of the Inspector General reviews the integrity of Agency
      operations through audits, appraisals, investigations and inspections.
        * Office of the Inspector General | Everett L. Mosley

                                Overseas Structure

         USAID programs overseas are grouped into various types of country
                                  organizations:
        * Countries where USAID provides an integrated package of assistance
          -- sustainable development countries. Assistance is based on an
          integrated strategy that includes clearly defined program
          objectives and performance targets.
        * Countries where USAID presence is limited, but where aid to
          non-governmental sectors is necessary to facilitate the emergence
          of a civic society, help alleviate repression, meet basic
          humanitarian needs, enhance food security, or influence a problem
          with regional or global implications.
        * Countries that have recently experienced a national crisis, a
          significant political transition, or a natural disaster and/or
          where timely assistance is needed to reinforce institutions and
          national order --transitional countries. USAID multi-country
          missions administer USAID programs and services involving multiple
          countries or provide regional services to other overseas
          organizations.
        * Various international development organizations and bilateral
          donors and represent U.S. and USAID interests in development
          assistance matters. These Offices may be only partially staffed by
          USAID personnel and may be headed by employees of other U.S.
          Government agencies.
        * Field office of the Inpector General carry out comprehensive
          programs of audits and investigations. These offices include:

        * Regional Inspector General for Audit offices and
        * Investigative Field Offices.

   A more complete description of these organizational units, authorities
      and responsibilities is available in Chapter 101 of the agency's
                     Automated Directives System (ADS.)
