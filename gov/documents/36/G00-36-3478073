State Courts Regional Director Wins Top National Honor

   San FranciscoThe National Center for State Courts (NCSC) has inducted
   Sheila Gonzalez, Regional Administrative Director of the Administrative
   Office of the Courts for Southern California, into the Warren E. Burger
   Society.  The Burger Society honors individuals who have demonstrated
   the highest commitment to improving the administration of justice
   through extraordinary contributions of service and support to the
   National Center for State Courts.

   U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Chief Judge
   Annice Wagner of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, chair of
   the National Centers Board of Directors and president of the Conference
   of Chief Justices, inducted the Burger Societys new members during a
   recent recognition luncheon in Washington, D.C.

   Ms. Gonzalez spent 14 years as executive officer of the Superior Court
   of Ventura County before accepting the post as the first regional
   administrative court director in February 2001.  During her time as
   Ventura Countys executive officer, Ms. Gonzalez brought great change
   and innovation to the countys courts.  Among other accomplishments, she
   started a free legal clinic in Venturas courthouse, installed kiosks in
   malls allowing people to pay traffic tickets electronically,
   spearheaded the computerization of the courts case filing system, and
   oversaw the merger of the countys municipal and superior courts.

   Sheila has been an enormous asset to the California courts, noted
   Administrative Director of the Courts William C. Vickrey.  California
   is truly fortunate to have such a dedicated and energetic court
   administrator.  I am pleased that the Burger Society and courts across
   the nation have recognized all of her hard work.

   Ms. Gonzalez is a former member of the NCSCs Board of Directors and has
   served on its Advisory Committee on Technology.  She served on the
   Conference of State Court Administrators and the National Association
   for Court Managements Joint Technology Committee.  Ms. Gonzalez was
   president of the National Association for Court Management and has been
   a personal contributor to the National Center for more than 15 years.

   The National Center for State Courts, founded by Chief Justice Warren
   E. Burger in 1971, is a non-profit organization dedicated to reforming
   the court system and improving the administration of justice.  The
   organization is headquartered in Williamsburg, Virginia.
