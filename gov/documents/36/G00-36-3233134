  Background

   The United States National Weather Service makes many of our warnings,
   advisories, forecast products, and observations available to the
   Internet audience on web and file servers. The NWS provides other
   globally received data and products and will continue to add more to
   the servers over time. The Universal Coordinated Time, commonly
   referred to as UTC, is important to understand when using
   hydrometeorological data. Please review our page on UTC.

   The File servers at the NWS Gateway provide NWS computer generated
   forecast products and observational data in WMO message code format as
   received for download (using the standard anonymous FTP protocol). As a
   Member of WMO, the United States National Weather Service has data and
   products received from international sources. Some United States
   international agreements contain special conditions placed by some
   countries on the use of some data and products . As the United States
   National Weather Service has global communication circuits, some of
   these data and computer derived products with conditions are available
   on our servers. Please go to the section on Additional Data and
   Products for details on this retreival process. The gridded forecast
   fields are not human readable products and must be computer processed
   before use. Many files of alphanumeric products available are on the
   File server in flat-ASCII files. WMO messages are combined in files
   (beginning with their abbreviated heading) by using a flag field
   between each message. This "flag field" is defined in detail on our
   file server naming practices web page.

   NOTE: The Web servers (data servers) may be viewed with any interactive
   Web browser. The various NWS web servers (sites) are located at local
   state forecast offices and/or central forecast facilities around the
   U.S. or at the NWS Gateway. (see our homepage)

                   Metadata on Server Directory Structure

             ( See our NEW file name Draft Standards HTML pages)

   All file contents (except for some model data set files) are collective
   groups of WMO messages. All meteorological data are coded in WMO
   standard code forms which are documented by WMO Manual 306. The model
   data set files having contents with no WMO abbreviated headings are all
   in GRIB or BUFR code format.

    Descriptions of Files Using Older File Name Standards

                                  Files for
       General Use   The description of files created to meet general
   meteorological scientific user requirements which generallycontain NCEP
      model output in GRIB code form or observational data in WMO code.
                                  Files for
     Special Purpose   The description of files created to meet specific
    meteorological user requirements. The data inthese files include data
     which has been sent on certain dedicated circuitsfrom the Gateway,
    specific individual collectives or groups of collectives,or specific
                               types of data.

   They are available for infrequent retrieval by those who wish to obtain
          a finite set of specific information. The original source
   meteorological bulletins are also available . Only the last received is
      made available. Older information is over-written with the latest
                                information.
     __________________________________________________________________

                         Access To Data and Products

   The structure of the data and products on the server is flat ASCII
   filesfor extraction by scientific meteorological research groups and
   others interested in these data sets. The various files contain
   collections of hydrometeorological forecast products or observational
   data generated in WMO message format; as well as, other files which
   contain major computer model data fields NOT generated in WMO message
   format. Files are created at specific time intervals and all data
   available in the telecommunications switching system at file creation
   time are included in each file.

                HOW TO DOWNLOAD DATA AND PRODUCTS USING HTTP

   The majority of our human readable text warnings, forecasts and
   observations are downloadable for viewing using standard web browsers.
   The service is provided on two major data providing servers. One server
   URL is weather.noaa.gov which operates the Internet Weather Source,
   abbreviated as IWS. The other server URL is weather.gov which operates
   the Interactive Weather Information Network, abbreviated as IWIN. These
   servers maintain only current products and observations. They do not
   store archived data and products. They also point to other servers
   which can maintain extensive products and data files, normally for FTP
   access. A new addition to the NWS web server product suite is the
   NEXRAD mosaic images for browser viewing. This service is on servers
   located across the United States. Each NWS Regional Headquarters
   operate servers that maintain the product images for their regional
   area NEXRAD sites. These products can be seen on each Weather Forecast
   Office Web Site. The top link to these new products is located on the
   IWS server.

                 HOW TO DOWNLOAD DATA AND PRODUCTS USING FTP

                                 Help Guide

   There is a "help guide" that can aid you in establishing the procedures
   you should use for retrieving data and forecast products from our file
   servers using the FTP protocol. This help guide addresses both the
   standard directory and file name practices used by the Gateway servers
   listed below and the parsed "individual data and forecast products"
   processed for our own use.

                             NOTICE TO FTP USERS

                  This is an open service for general use.

      Accessing servers with programs/scripts which are too repetitive,
    opening multiple concurrent sessions, and include the use of the FTP
   "ls" (list command) during the session will significantly reduce server
      response for everyone and severly impact the access by all users.

                    Servers for Data & Product Retrieval

   Here are the IP and URL address of the file servers of the Gateway you
   can access for downloading the many data and forecast products received
   by the Telecommunication Gateway.

                           Gateway FTPmail Service

   The Gateway servers are available for the extraction of files by using
   standard E-mail. This can be useful by meteorological research groups
   and general users interested in obtaining the data without having
   immediate access to the Internet. The various files that can be
   obtained include site observations, facsimile charts, or meteorological
   forecast products. The current E-mail address is
   ftpmail@weather.noaa.gov. There are details on using the Gateway
   FTPmail service for requesting data and products.

   You must first establish a list of desired products. You can best do
   this by accessing the server named below using your favorite web
   browser and a connection to the Internet through your Internet service
   provider. You will display and can record the file names of the data
   and products you will need for the future building of your FTPmail
   request. There are two subdirectories with specific data types
   available :
     * http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data - for data and forecast products
       (in ACSII readable format),
       and
     * http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/fax/ - for facsimile charts (in "TIFF"
       & "gif" format).

   if you have remote access to standard E-mail while onboard ships at
   sea, this is a way to get marine fascimile charts and off shore text
   forecasts. Additional details on using FTPmail discusses the data types
   available and their related input format structure.

                       International Data and Products
                                    with
                              Controlled Access

   A number of countries distribute a small set of data and products with
   conditions. The data and products are listed by WMO abbreviated
   heading. This web site lists only the WMO meteorological bulletins
   expected at the NWS Gateway from international sources.

   The U.S. agreed during the XIIth World Meteorological Congress (June
   1995) it would make its best effort to inform subsequent recipients of
   foreign data, exchanged over the World Weather Watch system, about
   conditions placed on "additional" meteorological and related data and
   products, according to WMO Resolution 40. Since the adoption of WMO
   Resolution 40, the U.S. private sector and research and education
   communities have had full access to all real-time data and products via
   the NOAA Family of Services dissemination system, and all delayed data
   and products via Anonymous FTP (file transfer protocol) over the
   Internet. To date, we are not aware of any violations by the U.S.
   meteorological community.

   The U.S. recently reviewed its policy on Internet distribution of
   foreign data and products. It was determined, according to the letter
   and spirit of WMO Resolution 40, "additional" data and products would
   be distributed over the Internet. As agreed, notification of the
   conditions on the "additional" data and products will be provided
   during distribution.

                          PROCEDURES for ACCESSING
            "Additional" Observational Data and Forecast Products

      [ NOTE: U.S. Data is Available Through The PROCEDURES FOR OPENLY
                    ACCESSIBLE DATA AND PRODUCTS Above ]
     [These "Additional Data & Products" are a limited subset from some
        countries in Europe, Asia, and South America (including their
                                territories)]
