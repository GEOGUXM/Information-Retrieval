   The NPMS will consist of multiple state repositories and a single
   National Repository. The state repositories will process the
   information for pipeline and LNG facilities within their state
   boundaries, and the National Repository will process the information
   for all other areas. The National Repository will serve as the final
   processing and storage facility for all pipeline data. The National
   Repository will also be responsible for collecting data from
   participating state repositories to create a seamless national pipeline
   and LNG database. These repositories will process the data according to
   set standards to ensure consistency. All data will pass through a final
   series of quality control checks before the data are made available to
   users. The repository will produce a random sampling of check plots
   after incorporating the operator's geospatial data and attribute data
   into the repository. These check plots will be returned to the operator
   for review as part of the quality control process.
