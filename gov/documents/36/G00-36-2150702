About 508

   Photograph of FOSE 2000 Exhibit In 1998, Congress amended the
   Rehabilitation Act to require Federal agencies to make their electronic
   and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.
   Inaccessible technology interferes with an individual's ability to
   obtain and use information quickly and easily. Section 508 was enacted
   to eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new
   opportunities for people with disabilities, and to encourage
   development of technologies that will help achieve these goals. The law
   applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain,
   or use electronic and information technology. Under Section 508 (29
   U.S.C. â€˜ 794d), agencies must give disabled employees and members of
   the public access to information that is comparable to the access
   available to others. It is recommended that you review the laws and
   regulations listed below to further your understanding about Section
   508 and how you can support implementation.
