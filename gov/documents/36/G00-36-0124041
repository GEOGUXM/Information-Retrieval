   BALDRIGE: For Hiring and Keeping the Best Employees addresses a
   significant challenge facing the CEOs of American business. Effective
   recruitment and retention of employees has become one of the most
   important issues facing corporate America. As businesses struggle with
   layoffs, lower consumer confidence, softening commercial investment,
   and a volatile stock market, this issue has moved from Human Resources
   to the boardroom. You can learn
   - how using the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence to conduct
   a self-assessment can improve recruitment and retention processes, and
   - the successful staffing strategies of three recent Baldrige Award
   recipients.
