   CD-ROMs

      The NOAA Coastal Services Center delivers many of its products via
      CD-ROMs. These products are divided into two categories, data and
      coastal resource management applications. The content of most of these
      CD-ROMS is available from this page.

Data


   Benthic Habitats of the New York/New Jersey Harbor
   Sediment profiling imagery and grab sampling were used to collect
   benthic habitat data from New York/New Jersey Harbor in 1994 and 1995.
   This CD-ROM contains the results of this study, as well as data
   available in a geographic information system, imagery, maps, and a
   technical report.

   Community Vulnerability Assessment Tool: New Hanover County, NC Case
   Study
   Helps local and state officials determine and prioritize their
   localities` vulnerability to coastal hazards.

   Florida Bay Imagery and Information CD-ROM
   This satellite imagery allows users to quickly document and observe
   water clarity trends and patterns.

   SeaView: Satellite Imagery of the Southeastern U.S. Coast CD-ROM
   Over 1,400 satellite Sea Surface Temperature (SST) maps (in a UNIX and
   PC compatible format) are on this CD-ROM.

Coastal Resource Management Applications

   Alabama Coastal Hazards Assessment
   This project provides access to multiple sources of hazards-related
   data and information that can be used for local planning and coastal
   management purposes.

   Engaging Communities: Participatory Strategies for Coastal Managers
   This site showcases three methods designed to enhance public
   participation in resource management decision making.

   Environmental Characterizations
   Characterizations provide comprehensive information about a particular
   areas environment, people, and issues. The resulting inventory is used
   as a management tool, educational resource, and an historical
   reference.
     * ACE Basin, South Carolina
     * Kachemak Bay, Alaska
     * Rookery Bay/Belle Meade Watershed, Florida

   Land Cover Change CD-ROMs
   Easy-to-use satellite-derived land cover data and a variety of other
   spatial data layers can be found on these CD-ROMs.
     * Columbia River Estuary, Washington/Oregon Land Cover Change CD-ROM
     * Yakutat, Alaska Land Cover Change CD-ROM
     * San Francisco Bay Area Land Cover Change CD-ROM

   Spatial Wetland Assessment for Management and Planning (SWAMP)
   Uses GIS and basic ecological principles to evaluate the relative
   significance of wetlands within a watershed.

   Submerged Aquatic Vegetation: Data Development and Applied Uses
   This CD-ROM includes technical mapping guidance, information about
   seagrasses, and examples of how submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) data
   and maps are used.

   Topographic LIDAR: An Emerging Beach Management Tool
   This project profiles how several states are using this topographic
   mapping tool to address coastal issues.

   Using Remote Sensing to Address Coastal Management Issues: The Maine
   Project
