What is this document?

   This is an application that a postsecondary educational institution
   must complete and submit to the U.S. Department of Education:
     * to be approved for the first time (initial certification) to
       participate in federal student financial aid programs,

   or
     * to be approved following a change of ownership, a conversion to a
       nonprofit institution, or a merger of two or more institutions
       (referred to as a "change in ownership or structure" for the
       remainder of this application) to participate in federal student
       financial aid programs,

   or
     * to be reapproved (recertification) to participate in federal
       student financial aid programs,

   or
     * to be designated as an "eligible institution" under the Higher
       Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), so that its students may
       receive deferments under federal student loan programs, or so that
       the institution may apply to participate in federal HEA programs
       other than student financial aid programs, including the Hope and
       Lifetime Learning Tax Credits,

   or
     * to be reinstated to participate in federal student financial aid
       programs.

When must an institution submit this application?

   An institution (referred to as "you" for the remainder of this
   application) must submit this application to the U.S. Department of
   Education (referred to as "we" for the remainder of this application)
   when:
     * You wish to be initially certified to participate in federal
       student financial aid programs.

   or
     * You undergo a change of ownership or structure and you wish to
       participate in federal student financial aid programs. You must
       notify us no later than 10 calendar days after the change becomes
       effective. If this due date falls on a weekend or a federal
       holiday, you may submit the notification no later than the next
       business day. After you receive your state and accrediting agency
       approvals, submit this application and mail copies of the approvals
       to us. We encourage you to complete your application and submit it
       as soon as possible.

   or
     * You wish to be recertified to continue to participate in federal
       student financial aid programs. You should submit this fully
       completed application before the expiration date in your Program
       Participation Agreement (PPA). If you submit your application to us
       no later than 90 calendar days before your PPA expires, your
       eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid
       programs continues until your application is either approved or
       denied. This is true even if we do not complete our evaluation of
       your application before the PPA expiration date. (For example, if
       your PPA expires on June 30 and you submit your application by
       April 1, you will remain certified during our review period even if
       our review extends beyond June 30.) If the 90th day before your
       PPA's expiration falls on a weekend or a federal holiday and you
       submit your application no later than the next business day, we
       will consider the application to be submitted 90 calendar days
       before your PPA expires.

   or
     * You wish to become eligible so that your students may receive
       deferments under federal student loan programs, or so that you may
       participate in federal HEA programs other than student financial
       aid programs, including the Hope and Lifetime Learning Tax Credits.

   or
     * You wish to be reinstated to participate in federal student
       financial aid programs.

   We will consider your date of submission to be the date you used the
   "Submit Application" page to electronically submit the application to
   us.

How is this application organized?

   This application is divided into 13 sections, plus a glossary at the
   end.
     * Section A through Section D contain general questions about your
       institution.
     * Section E and Section F contain questions about your educational
       programs and locations.
     * Section G contains questions about your telecommunications and/or
       correspondence (tele/corr) courses, students enrolled under
       ability-to-benefit provisions, and incarcerated students.
     * Section H is for institutions that are initial applicants,
       institutions with a change in ownership or structure, and
       institutions seeking reinstatement.
     * Section I is for foreign institutions, including foreign graduate
       medical schools.
     * Section J contains questions about your third-party servicers.
     * Section K contains questions about your administrative capability
       and your financial responsibility.
     * Section L must be signed by your President/CEO/Chancellor and
       mailed to us.
     * Section M contains a list of documents you must send to us with the
       signature page (Section L).
     * Glossary

   Note: To expand on any of your answers, you may use Question 69.

   Why is there a glossary?

   We mean a specific definition for many of the words and phrases in this
   application, such as "regular student," "award year," and "federal
   student financial aid programs." When filling out the application, you
   must be sure that you know how terms are defined. The definitions
   contained in the glossary generally are restatements of statutory or
   regulatory definitions.

Paperwork Reduction Statement

   According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, no persons are
   required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a
   valid OMB control number. The valid OMB control number for this
   information collection is 1845-0012. The time required to complete this
   information collection is estimated to average 17 hours per response,
   including the time to review instructions, search existing data
   resources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the
   information collection. If you have any comments concerning the
   accuracy of the time estimate or suggestions for improving this form,
   please write to: U.S. Department of Education, Washington, D.C.
   20202-4651. If you have comments or concerns regarding the status of
   your individual submission of this form, write directly to: Case
   Management and Oversight, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland
   Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20202-5323.

Privacy Act Disclosure Notice

       We collect Social Security numbers (SSNs) of the owners of the
       institutions. The SSNs are used to determine institutional
       eligibility and to verify identities. The SSNs are collected under
       the authority of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Pub.
       L. 104-134. This act requires Federal agencies to secure the TIN
       (the Social Security Number, for individuals) of persons "doing
       business with the agency," a term that includes being "in a
       relationship with the agency that may give rise to a receivable due
       that agency." 31 U.S.C. ยง7701(c)(1), (2)(E).

   Note:
   Due to security concerns, ED is not collecting SSNs over the Internet
   at this time. Instead, if applicable, you must submit your SSNs to ED
   by writing them on Section M of the application.

How to complete this application

   Step 1:

   You must have an OPE ID assigned by the Department of Education to use

What is your status during our review period?

   During our review period, your status will be as follows:

   Or
     * If you change ownership or structure, the Secretary may continue
       the institution's participation on a provisional basis, provided
       that the institution under the new ownership submits a "materially
       complete application" that is received by the Secretary no later
       than 10 business days after the change occurs.

   or
     * If you were certified, you will remain certified during our review
       period if you submit your application during the correct time frame
       described earlier.

   or
     * If you never have been an eligible institution under the HEA, you
       will not be considered eligible during our review period.
