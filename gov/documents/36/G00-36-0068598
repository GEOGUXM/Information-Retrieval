   star (bullet) Using the OJP Search Capability

     Examples and help for simple and advanced searches

     By entering information and instructions in the box provided, you
     can search all of the downloadable documents (.pdf, .txt, and .html)
     and OJP web pages including the National Criminal Justice Reference
     Service and all Offices and Bureaus. (Other OJP related sites
     without a .gov URL and the Safe Communities page are not part of the
     standard search.) The search will result in a list of links to web
     pages and downloadable documents that contain the information you
     were searching for.

     This instruction is to help you formulate your queries so that you
     will find the materials you want.

     Simple searches

     * Words

        Entries composed of a single word will result in a search that
                includes that word and related words.

                The entry of the word defense will look for all documents
                that include the word crime and related words like
                defenses or defensive.

        Words surrounded by quotation marks trigger a literal search which
                is helpful in looking for proper names.

                For example, "defense" will only search for the word
                defense.

        Words with special characters must be in quotation marks.

     * Phrases

        Queries of two or more words separated by spaces will result in a
                search for phrases containing those words in the same
                order.

                For example, the entry of public defender will result in a
                search for all documents with the phrase public defender
                and not for the individual words of public and defender.

        The entry of phrases enclosed in quotation marks will search for
                an exact match to the phrase.

                A search for "Public Defender Initiative" will find
                documents that contain the phrase exactly as typed
                including capitalization.

        To search for phrases that contain the words AND, OR, or NOT, the
                phrase or the connecting word must be in quotes. The words
                AND, OR and NOT invoke search special instructions. (See
                below for more information)

                The entry of the phrase "crime and justice" or crime "and"
                justice will result in a search of all documents that
                contain the complete phrase. The entry of the phrase crime
                and justice will result in a search for all documents that
                contain either word.

     * Groups of words or phrases

        More than one word or phrase can be searched for by separating
                words or phrases with commas. The search will find any
                document containing at least one matching word or phrase.
                The comma is interchangable with the Boolean search term
                <AND>.

                To find documents that contain any of the words crime,
                police, and victims, enter crime, police, victims.

                The query of criminal justice system, law enforcement will
                search for all documents that contain either phrase.

     Advanced query options
     * Boolean searches

        <AND> -- finds documents containing both words or phrases and is
                interchangable with a comma.

                To find documents that contain both murder and prison,
                enter either murder, prison or murder<AND>prison

        <OR> -- finds documents containing at least one of the words or
                phrases.

                To find any document that has a reference to any type of
                violent crime, enter violent crime
                <OR>murder<OR>robbery<OR>assault<OR>rape

        <NOT> -- finds documents that do not contain a specific word or
                phrase.

                To find documents containing the words "violent," but not
                the word "property", enter violent<NOT>property

     * Proximity searches

        Using <NEAR> in a query looks for documents containing search
                terms within close proximity of each other. Document
                scores are calculated based on the relative number of
                words between search terms; the closer the search terms,
                the higher the score. Such searches are particularly
                effective across collections of long documents where the
                words may appear in separate sections without any
                relevancy to each other.

                To find documents that contain the word victim and the
                word murder within close proximity to each other, enter
                victim<NEAR>murder

        You can limit your search for words or phrases that occur within a
                sentence or paragraph by using <SENTENCE>, <PARAGRAPH> .
                The syntax for using these operators is similar.

                To find documents that contain the word victim and the
                word murder within the same paragraph, enter
                victim<PARAGRAPH>murder. The results should include all
                documents that discussed victim and murder within the same
                paragraph.

        You can also combine proximity searches with boolean searches to
                refine your search.

                If you are looking for documents with discussions about
                violent offenders who were not murderers you would search
                for variations of the words violent and offender in close
                proximity to each other, but not the word murder, enter
                violent<NEAR>offender<AND> <NOT>murder

     * Zone searches

        In Web documents, you can limit your search to the contents of any
                named Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) tag, such as
                <TITLE> and <H1> by forming the query with words or
                phrases to be found <IN> followed by the name of the HTML
                tag.

                To find Web documents whose titles have variations of the
                word statistics in them, enter statistics<IN>title
