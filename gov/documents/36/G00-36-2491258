   Research Areas

   Plant Aging:

   Research and development (R&D) to understand, characterize, and manage
   or mitigate effects of plant aging on key plant components, such as
   reactor pressure vessels and vessel internals, steam generators,
   electric cables, primary system piping, and safety-related concrete
   structures. Specific projects include:

     Steam Generators
     * Steam Generator Non Destructive Examination (NDE) Test Mockup
       Facility
     * Advanced Eddy-Current Inspection System for Automatic Detection and
       Characterization of Defects in Steam Generator Tubes

     Cables
     * Empirical Data to Characterize Aging Degradation of Polymers Used
       in Electrical Cable
     * Condition Monitoring (CM) Techniques for Low Voltage Electrical
       Cable
     * Condition Monitoring (CM) Techniques for Medium Voltage Electrical
       Cable

     Steel Aging and Fatigue
     * Mechanical Behavior of Irradiated Structural Stainless Steels
     * Fatigue
     * Assessment of Aging Effects on Components and Structures from
       Nuclear Power Plants
     * Irradiation-Induced Swelling and Stress Relaxation of PWR Reactor
       Core Internal Components

   Generation Optimization:

   R&D to develop and demonstrate technologies to optimize the power
   output from existing nuclear power plants. For example, developing
   Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)-licensable replacements for
   outdated analog instrumentation and controls, self-checking/calibrating
   sensors, fiber optic technology, and on-line diagnostics and
   information management systems. R&D to develop and demonstrate
   technologies in other areas that will enhance the safe and
   cost-effective operation of current plants in areas such as human
   performance.

     Installation of Digital Instrumentation and Control (I&C) Systems
     * Revision of Guideline on Licensing Digital Upgrades Based on
       Revised 10CFR50.59 Rule
     * On-Line Monitoring of Non-Redundant Sensors for Signal Validation
       and Instrument Calibration Reduction

     Organizational Factors and Human Performance Issues
     * Human Factors Guidance for Digital I&C Systems and Hybrid Control
       Rooms

     Risk Technologies
     * Low Power and Shut Down Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA)
       Benchmarking
     * Develop Methods to Incorporate Organizational Factors into Risk
       Analyses

     Other Generic Generation Optimization R&D
     * Motor Rewind Insulation System Development and Qualification for
       Harsh Environments
     * R&D Needs to Address Potential Vulnerabilities Arising from Grid
       Voltage Inadequacies
