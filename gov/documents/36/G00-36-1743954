About the Board

   The California Integrated Waste Management Board is responsible for
   managing California's solid waste stream. The Board is helping
   California divert its waste from landfills by:
     * Developing waste reduction programs.
     * Providing public education and outreach.
     * Assisting local governments and businesses.
     * Fostering market development for recyclable materials.

   The Board also protects public health and the environment by:
     * Encouraging used oil recycling.
     * Regulating waste management facilities.
     * Cleaning up abandoned and illegal dump sites.

   For the big picture of what we do, see our vision and mission. For more
   details about the individual programs, see the program
   responsibilities. Our annual report provides a summary of Board
   accomplishments for calendar year 2000.

   The Board is one of six agencies under the umbrella of the California
   Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA). To learn more about the
