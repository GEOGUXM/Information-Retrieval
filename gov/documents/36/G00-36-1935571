   A facilities plan identifies how wastewater treatment needs will be met
       while protecting existing and future water quality. The City of
   Columbus' initial Facilities Plan was submitted in 1976 and updated in
     1984. This Facilities Plan Update is a plan that addresses regional
      wastewater management needs through 2020. The City of Columbus is
       submitting the Facilities Plan Update to the Ohio Environmental
    Protection Agency to be incorporated into the 208 Areawide Wastewater
                 Treatment Plan for the Central Ohio Region.

             The policies and goals of the updated plan are to:
     * Protect critical water resources, especially in the Darby Watershed
     * Maximize existing infrastructure investments
     * Incorporate watershed planning
     * Mitigate stormwater impacts from urban development
     * Curb urban sprawl

    Not only does the plan support the anticipated growth in the next 20
   years, but it also protects the environment and the quality of life in
                                Central Ohio.

     After a four month consultation process with the stakeholders, the
   final plan was submitted to the Ohio EPA on November 9, 2000. The final
   plan is currently under review by the Ohio EPA, and the current version
                         can be viewed under REPORT.

   The actual boundaries of the facilities plan can be viewed in the MAPS.

   Additional information and answers to common questions are shown in the
