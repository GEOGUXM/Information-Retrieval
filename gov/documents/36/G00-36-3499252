   List of Purchased Journals

      This is a searchable database of the 2,238 current subscriptions
      purchased by the USGS Library. It represents a partial listing of the
      journal holdings in the collection since many titles come to the
      library through exchange partnerships.

      A search on a word or phrase in the title will produce a list of titles
      with corresponding call numbers and library locations. The search
      engine truncates words to the left and right, so that a search on scien
      will retrieve titles containing the words science, scientific, and
      bioscience.

      A Boolean OR search will find titles containing any of the terms
      entered. A Boolean AND search will find only those titles containing
      all of the terms entered.
