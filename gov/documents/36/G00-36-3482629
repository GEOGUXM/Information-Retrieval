   Resources
   The natural resources of our Nation are its land, water, minerals, and
   energy. These renewable and nonrenewable resources are needed to
   sustain life and to maintain and enhance our economic strength.

   hazards Hazards
   Hazards are unpreventable natural events that, by their nature, may
   expose our Nation's population to the risk of death or injury and may
   damage or destroy private property, societal infrastructure, and
   agricultural or other developed land.

   environment Environment
   Our nation's environment--the air, water, soil, and plant and animal
   life--is constantly changing as natural processes and human actions
   affect it.

   information Information Management
   Information management is both a strategy, driven by customer needs,
   and an infrastructure, shaped by technology, for handling and
   distributing information. Information management crosses disciplinary
   and administrative boundaries.
