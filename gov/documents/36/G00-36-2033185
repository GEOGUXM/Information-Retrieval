   This document provides links to various LANL tools for working with
   UDF:

   UDF-DLM package for IDL   [download]
          This package provides a simple, fast, easy-to-use (and
          easy-to-learn!) interface for IDL programmers.

   IDL shortcuts
          Tired of spelling out gobs of redundant information?

   Command-line equivalent of UDFAdmin
          For people who prefer to leave the boring stuff for the computer
          to do.

   Automating FTP
          There's no reason to waste your time ftp'ing files.

   Ed's description of UDF file layout
          Describes the organization of PIDF, VIDF, and data files.

   PIDFs
          PIDF files for all of IMAGE, translated into human-readable
          form, with errors highlighted.
