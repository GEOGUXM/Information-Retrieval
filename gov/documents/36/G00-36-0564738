   The Legislature significantly revised public safety and treatment
   policy  regarding mentally ill offenders.  In 1998, 2SSB 6214 extended
   the criminal competency restoration process to misdemeanant defendants
   determined to be a threat to public safety, expanded the criteria for
   involuntary treatment under civil commitment laws, and required greater
   information-sharing between treatment providers and criminal justice
   agencies.  The Washington State Institute for Public Policy is
   evaluating these policies.

   The evaluation will address the following research questions:
     * Are misdemeanor defendants judged as incompetent to stand trial and
       meeting the public safety threat criteria receiving competency
       restoration treatment?
     * What is the duration and outcome of the competency restoration
       process?
     * Does court-ordered treatment reduce criminal recidivism?
     * How effective are the information-sharing provisions of the law?

   The evaluation is a pre-post design with a historical comparison
   group.  Defendants who received competency restoration treatment in the
   first year of the new legislationMarch 1999 through February 2000are
   being identified and will be tracked for at least a three-year period.
   A comparison group of misdemeanor defendants who were assessed as
   incompetent and whose characteristics meet the public safety threat
   criteria for 6214 misdemeanants are also being identified and tracked.

   Mental health treatment and criminal offense data are being collected
   for each defendant prior to and following competency restoration
   treatment.  This design allows us to compare the outcomes of defendants
   assessed as incompetent before and after the legislation was
   implemented.  The final evaluation report is due November 15, 2003.
