        SSA's Performance and Accountability Report for FY 2001 integrates
        Government Performance and Results Act performance reporting with the
        agency's audited financial statements to provide full disclosure of
        SSA's financial and programmatic operations. FY 2001 marks the
        fifteenth year that SSA has published audited financial statements, the
        eighth year that SSA has received an unqualified opinion on its
        financial statements and the seventh year that SSA has consolidated
        statutorily required financial reporting into a single report.

        Highlights of SSA's FY 2001 Performance and Accountability Report
        include a Ten-Year Summary of Financial Highlights and Management's
        Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) which consists of five sections:
          * SSA's Mission, Programs and Agency Organization which discusses
            SSA's programs;
          * Major Issues Facing SSA which discusses current issues with
            possible impact on future operations;
          * Performance Goals and Results which provides FY 2001 results for
            key GPRA performance indicators;
          * Highlights of SSA's Financial Position which discusses SSA's
            financial statements and uses of budgetary resources; and
          * Systems and Controls which discusses compliance with various
            financial management statutes and provides the Commissioner's
            assurance statement of compliance with provisions of the Federal
            Manager's Financial Integrity Act.

        The report contains a message from SSA's Commissioner, SSA's audited
        financial statements, GPRA performance results and supplemental program
        performance information categorized by SSA's business processes and
        service delivery interfaces. It also includes the report on the Audit
        of SSA's FY 2001 Financial Statements and the Office of Inspector
        General's Statement on SSA's Major Management Challenges.
