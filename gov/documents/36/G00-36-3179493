CPSC Offers Tips to Prevent Home Fires Caused by Space Heaters
-- Devices Associated with 21,800 Fires and 300 Deaths Annually

   WASHINGTON, D.C. - As fire departments across the country battle winter
   home fires, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) reminds
   consumers to demonstrate care when purchasing and using space heaters.
   CPSC estimates that space heaters, including both fixed and portable
   heaters, are associated with about 21,800 residential fires every year.
   About 300 people die each year in fires started by these heaters.
   Fuel-burning space heaters also can cause carbon monoxide poisoning and
   indoor air pollution, because of improper venting or incomplete
   combustion.
   "We're still seeing too many space heater fires," said CPSC Acting
   Chairman Thomas Moore. "While CPSC has worked hard with industry to
   improve safety standards for space heaters, consumers must exercise
   care in their purchase and use."
   Consumers should be aware that older space heaters might not meet the
   newer safety standards. The CPSC has worked to upgrade the industry
   standards on electric, kerosene and unvented gas space heaters. An
   automatic cut-off device is now required, which turns off electric or
   kerosene heaters if they tip over. More guarding around the heating
   coils of electric heaters and the burner of kerosene heaters also is
   required to prevent fires. CPSC worked to upgrade the industry standard
   on unvented gas heaters, as well, to provide an oxygen depletion sensor
   to shut off the heater if the oxygen level drops too low.
   Here are some CPSC safety tips for buying and using space heaters:
    1. Select a space heater with a guard around the flame area or heating
       element. Place the heater on a level, hard and nonflammable
       surface, not on rugs or carpets or near bedding or drapes. Keep the
       heater at least three feet from bedding, drapes, furniture, or
       other flammable materials.
    2. Choose a space heater that has been tested and certified by a
       nationally recognized testing laboratory. These heaters meet
       specific safety standards.
    3. Keep doors open to the rest of the house if you are using an
       unvented fuel-burning space heater. This helps prevent pollutant
       build-up and promotes proper combustion. Follow the manufacturer's
       instructions to provide sufficient combustion air to prevent CO
       production.
    4. Never leave a space heater on when you go to sleep. Never place a
       space heater close to any sleeping person.
    5. Turn the space heater off if you leave the area. Keep children and
       pets away from space heaters.
    6. Have a smoke detector with fresh batteries on each level of the
       house and a carbon monoxide detector outside your sleeping area.
    7. Be aware that mobile homes require specially designed heating
       equipment. Only electric or vented fuel-fired heaters should be
       used.
    8. Have gas and kerosene space heaters inspected annually.
