   Sanctuaries

      This section, Marine Sanctuaries, provides summary descriptions of each
      marine sanctuary. The descriptions include physical, biological,
      archaeological and cultural resources; resource management techniques;
      research and education activities; official rules and regulations
      governing activities in the sanctuary; how visitors can get access to
      the sanctuary; and how to contact the sanctuary staff. Most marine
      sanctuaries maintain their own Web sites. Links to these sites are
   found on the introductory pages.

   These descriptions are being developed in conjunction with the
   Sustainable Seas Expeditions. Presently, there are descriptions for the
   first ten sanctuaries to be visited by the expeditions (April through
   January 2000): Channel Islands, Cordell Bank, Gulf of the Farallones,
   Monterey Bay , Olympic Coast , Stellwagen Bank, Gray's Reef, Florida
   Keys, Flower Garden Banks, and Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale.

   In 1972, exactly one hundred years after the first national park was
   created, the nation made a similar commitment to preserving its marine
   treasures by establishing the National Marine Sanctuary Program. Since
   then, twelve national marine sanctuaries, representing a wide variety
   of ocean environments, have been designated.

   Today, our marine sanctuaries encompass deep ocean gardens, nearshore
   coral reefs, whale migration corridors, deep sea canyons, and even
   underwater archeological sites. They range in size from one-quarter
   square mile in Fagatele Bay, American Samoa to over 5,300 square miles
   in Monterey Bay, California, one of the largest marine protected areas
   in the world. Together these sanctuaries protect nearly 18,000 square
   miles of ocean waters and habitats, an area nearly the size of Vermont
   and New Hampshire combined. While some activities are regulated or
   prohibited in sanctuaries to protect resources, multiple uses such as
   recreation, commercial fishing, and shipping, are encouraged. Research,
   educational, and outreach activities are other major components in each
   sanctuary's program of resource protection.
