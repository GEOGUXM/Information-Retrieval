      Dear Science Teachers,

      T he National Marine Fisheries Service celebrated its 125th Anniversary
      on
      9 February 1996.  In recognition of this historical event, staff of the
      National Marine Fisheries Service created a teacher's Resource Guide
      for your K-12 curriculum planning and student activities during the
      school year. This 50-page resource guide uses word-scramble pages,
      mazes, and various types of work sheets and quizzes to help you and
      your students understand the role and contributions of the National
      Marine Fisheries Service.

      T he PDF format of the on-line pages allows you to view and print from
      your personal computer using Adobe Acrobat Reader.

      p.gif (175 bytes) rinted copies of the Science Resource Guide can be
      requested by teachers. Please contact Gary Duker -- Alaska Fisheries
      Science Center, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA, 98115
