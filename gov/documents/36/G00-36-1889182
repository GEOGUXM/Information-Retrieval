Introduction

       Walk into a darkened room and turn on the lights. The gleam of
   furniture, the color and texture of carpets and curtains are instantly
    visible. A simple everyday act-but the science behind it is a complex
   and increasingly important part of materials design and manufacturing.
    Light from a light source hits a surface and part of it is scattered
   and transmitted to your eyes. The visual perception of an object- what
    we call its appearance arises from the interaction of incident light
    with the object's surface geometry or texture. Optical properties of
   the material (such as index of refraction or polarization) also play a
          very important role. Will there come a day when given the
   microstructural and optical properties of a material a computer program
    can create the image of a chair made with that material? Making that
      day a reality will depend on the outcome of research done today.

    For some years computer programs have produced images of scenes based
    on a simulation of scattering and reflection of light off one or more
   surfaces. In response to increasing demand for the use of rendering in
      design and manufacturing, the models used in these programs have
      undergone intense research in the computer graphics community. In
    particular, more physically realistic models are sought (i.e. models
    that more accurately depict the physics of light interaction). There
     has however been a lack of relevant optical measurements needed to
      complement the modelling. As part of the NIST competency project
   entitled "Measurement Science for Optical Reflectance and Scattering",
       Fern Hunt of MCSD 891 coordinated the development of a computer
    rendering system that utilizes high quality optical measurements that
         will be used to render physically realistic and potentially
      photorealistic images. We collaborated with Gary Meyer and Harold
       Westlund of Computer and Information Sciences Department at the
      University of Oregon. Michael Metzler of Isciences Inc. developed
        optical measurement protocols that could be used to generate
           appropriate data and models for the rendering program.
