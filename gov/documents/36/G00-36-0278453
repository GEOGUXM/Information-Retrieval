                          Interoperable MPI Testing

   The NIST IMPI test tool enables developers to test their IMPI
   implementations for conformance to the IMPI protocol standard.
   The test tool consists of four major components:

   Test Interpreter
          This is a program (sutInterp) that you download from this site.
          You compile it and link it with the interoperable implementation
          of MPI that you want to test. It is then run in coordination
          with the test tool applet. It executes test scripts delivered to
          it by the NIST test server.

   Test Tool Applet
          This is the user interface to the NIST IMPI test system. It
          coordinates the execution of the test interpreter and the test
          server.

   Test Scripts
          The test scripts are selected by the user through the test tool
          applet and are exectuted by the test interpreter and test
          server. These scripts are designed to exercise and verify
          aspects of the IMPI protocol. The scripts are written in a
          C-like language.

   Test Server
          This program resides entirely on a NIST host. It implements the
          Interoperable MPI protocols for the purpose of testing. Through
          the use of the test applet, it executes tests scripts in concert
          with the test interpreter. It is running all of the time,
          listening for a connection from the test applet.
