                             [p_scroll1.jpg] A MESSAGE FROM

                           THE OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL


   The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) is the FLRA's independent
   investigator and prosecutor.  The General Counsel, who is appointed by
   the President with the advice and consent of the Senate for a five-year
   term, is responsible for the management of the OGC, including the
   management of the FLRA's seven Regional Offices.  Under the provisions
   of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, the Deputy General Counsel
   serves as the Acting General Counsel when this position is vacant. The
   General Counsel, through the seven Regional Offices, is initially
   responsible for processing unfair labor practice (ULP) allegations and
   representation matters filed with the FLRA.  As to ULP matters, the
   Regional Offices investigate, settle, and determine whether to dismiss
   or prosecute ULP charges.  The General Counsel also decides appeals of
   a Regional Director's decision not to issue a ULP complaint.  The
   Regional Offices also ensure compliance with all ULP orders issued by
   the Authority.  The resolution of representation matters includes,
   among other things, conducting elections and making appropriate unit
   determinations.  The Office of the General Counsel encourages the use
   of various alternative dispute resolution techniques in striving to
   help parties in the Federal sector achieve a stable and productive
   labor-management relationship.  This is accomplished through the use of
   facilitation, intervention, training and education programs.

   Information and answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about all
   aspects of the work of the Office of the General Counsel and the seven
   Regional offices can be found by clicking on one of the subject matter
   buttons below.  In the future, we hope to develop a subscription e-mail
   weekly newsletter as a means of keeping the public up to date on OGC
   activities and other items of interest.
