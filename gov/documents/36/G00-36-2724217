   Below is a map of the USGS network of magnetic observatories. Data
   plots for today and the previous seven days are available. Data are
   displayed in Universal Time (UT), and updated every 30 minutes. The
   data are received via NOAA's GOES-East and GOES-West satellites in
   near-real time (every 12 minutes).

   The components plotted represent the horizontal intensity (H), the
   Declination (D), the vertical intensity (Z), and the total field (F).
   Declination is given in units of angle, and represents the angle the
   magnetic field makes with true north. The scale is given in
   tenth-units. The other components are given in nanoTeslas (1 nT =
   0.00001 Gauss). For a diagram showing these components, please refer
   to:  http://geomag.usgs.gov/frames/mag_mod.htm.

   [arrow3.gif] NOTE: The plots are of raw, preliminary data !!  They are
   not to be used as final data values.
