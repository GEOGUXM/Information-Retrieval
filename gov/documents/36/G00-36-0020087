   Statistics

   The Report of the Visa Office is a compilation of statistical data for
   each fiscal year. The Report includes information on all visa issuances
   by consular offices and on the use of visa numbers in the numerically
   limited catagories. The sources of information for the data are
   workload reports from visa-issuing offices abroad and immigrant visa
   number allocation records maintained at the Visa Office. The Report
   does not contain information on refugees or on persons granted
   adjustment to permanent resident status by the Immigration and
   Naturalization Service (INS), except to the extent that such
   adjustments of status in the numerically limited catagories are
   reflected in the tables of immigrant number use. The most recent Report
   of the Visa Office is the 1998 edition. To obtain a copy, call Visa
   Services at 202-663-1225.
