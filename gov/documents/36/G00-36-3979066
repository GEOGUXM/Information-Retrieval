   Along with other Bankruptcy Courts and in conjunction with the
   Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and the Bankruptcy Noticing
   Center, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of
   Virginia is making available advanced systems technology for preparing,
   producing and sending certain computer generated notices, which can be
   transmitted to notice recipients in one of three ways:

     (1) Internet E-Mail - for recipients who want the speed and
     convenience of receiving notices online;
     (2) Fax - for recipients who don't want to set up an Internet E-Mail
     account for this purpose, but want to eliminate mail pieces; or
     (3) Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) - for high-volume recipients
     (200 or more notices per week) who want to automatically process
     data using computer database-to-computer data transfers.

   Electronic Bankruptcy Noticing (EBN) recipients will:

     (1) Receive notices faster since notices will be transmitted
     electronically from the BNC directly and not through the U.S. Postal
     Service;
     (2) Reduce their processing expenses by replacing manual processing
     expenses by replacing manual processing with automated procedures;
     (3) Receive technical support from the BNC.
