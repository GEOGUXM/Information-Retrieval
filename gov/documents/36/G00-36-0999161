   Bose-Einstein Condensation at NIST

      Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) emerged in the mid-1990s as one of the
      cutting-edge themes of contemporary physics. This is due to the
      development of powerful techniques for experiments with ultracold
      quantum gases, many of which were pioneered at NIST.

      In addition to their fundamental scientific appeal, these systems offer
      great promise for the precision measurement applications that are at
      the core of NIST's mission. Several groups in the NIST Physics
      Laboratory are currently working on different aspects of BEC and the
      physics of quantum gases. This page provides an informal look at their
      work.

                                Eric Cornell
                      NIST Physicist Wins Nobel Prize!
   Eric Cornell of NIST and Carl Wieman of the University of Colorado are
   winners of the 2001 Nobel Prize in physics along with Wolfgang Ketterle
      of MIT. They are recognized "for the achievement of Bose-Einstein
   condensation in dilute gases of alkali atoms, and for early fundamental
               studies of the properties of the condensates."
