                                Commissioners

   The Board itself is composed of nine Commissioners, headed by the
   Chairperson. All Commissioners are appointed by the Governor to
   staggered four year terms and must be confirmed by the Senate. They
   conduct parole consideration hearings for inmates sentenced to life
   terms with the possibility of parole. The Commissioners, as voting
   members of the BPT, establish terms and conditions of parole for all
   persons released on parole in California and may make recommendations
   to the Governor for pardon and executive clemency.
