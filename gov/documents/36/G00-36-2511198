   Presented in the following pages are image products and information
   generated using remote sensing in non-marine/coastal and non-arid type
   environments. Digital image products for practical applications, such
   as resource evaluation and mapping, help generate information and data
   that can be used by various fields and disciplines for research,
   mapping, exploration, and education.
