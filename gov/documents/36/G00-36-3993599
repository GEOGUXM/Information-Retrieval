             The Salary Schedule for the State's Elected Officials for 2001-02 was
                             Adopted on May 18th

   The Salary Commission sets the salaries of the state's elected
   officials -- the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State,
   Treasurer, Auditor, Attorney General, Superintendent of Public
   Instruction, Commissioner of Public Lands, and the Insurance
   Commissioner; members of the Legislature; Justices of the Supreme Court
   and judges of the Court of Appeals, superior courts, and district
   courts.

   The Commission is required by law to base the salaries of the elected
   officials on realistic standards and to pay them according to the
   duties of their office.  The biennial salary setting process begins
   with the adoption of a proposed salary schedule.  That schedule is then
   presented to the public for comment at hearings held in areas around
   the state.  The salary schedule for 2001 and 2002 was adopted after a
   public hearing on May 18, 2001. Unless overturned by voter referendum,
   the salary schedule will take effect 90 days after being filed with the
   Secretary of State..

   The current salaries of the state's elected officials and the 2001-02
   salary schedule can be found on the salary schedule page.

   Public input is welcome and encouraged.  See the contact page for
   information on how to send your comments to the Commission.
