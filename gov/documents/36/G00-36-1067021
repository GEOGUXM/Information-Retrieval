   IN THE United States Court of Appeals FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
   CIRCUIT Nos. 00-5212, 5213 MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellant,
   v. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and STATE OF NEW YORK, et al.,
   Plaintiffs-Appellees. ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
   FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPELLANT'S REPLY BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF
   MOTION FOR STAY OF THE MANDATE PENDING PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
   None of the arguments advanced by appellees undermines Microsoft's
   position that this Court should stay issuance of its mandate pending
   the Supreme Court's final disposition of Microsoft's petition for a
   writ of certiorari. Microsoft's stay motion complies fully with Rule 41
   of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which requires a showing
   "that the certiorari petition would present a substantial question and
   that there is good cause for a stay." (Circuit Rule 41 is to the same
   effect.) Appellees' effort to import a strict "irreparable injury"
   requirement into Rule 41 should be rejected. The cases on which
   appellees rely all involve a single Justice of the Supreme Court
   considering an application to stay a final judgment under 28 U.S.C. §
   2101(f) after a court of appeals has already denied such a stay. Those
   cases, which do not purport to interpret Rule 41, are inapposite. As
   this Court noted in Lincoln Tel. & Tel. Co. v. FCC, 659 F.2d 1092, 1110
   (D.C. Cir. 1981) (per curiam), a case cited by appellees (Appellees'
   Br. at 2 n.1), a stay pending a peti- tion for a writ certiorari may be
   granted if the stay is "necessary to serve the public interest and will
   not substantially harm the opposing parties in th[e] proceeding." See
   ROBERT L. STERN, APPELLATE PRACTICE IN THE UNITED STATES § 16.8, at
   467-68 (2d ed. 1989). That standard is met here. The public interest
   will be served by granting a stay. The district judge, while disqual-
   ified by virtue of deliberate and repeated violations of clear ethical
   rules, entered findings of fact and conclusions of law that have been
   and will be relied upon in subsequent proceedings in this case and
   perhaps in other cases. As this Court observed, the extraordinary
   pattern of misconduct engaged in by the district judge-which began two
   months before entry of the findings of fact and six months before entry
   of the conclusions of law-created an appearance of partiality in
   violation of 28 U.S.C. § 455(a). (Op. at 120.) The public interest
   would not be served by permitting proceedings on remand to commence
   before the Supreme Court has had an opportunity to decide whether
   actions tainted by the district judge's misconduct must be vacated. On
   the other side of the balance, appellees make no showing that they will
   suffer sub- stantial harm if this Court grants the requested stay. If
   the Supreme Court elects not to consi- der the question posed in
   Microsoft's petition, the stay will likely remain in effect for no more
   than six weeks. Little will happen during that short period. In any
   case, appellees offer only vague generalizations about purported
   uncertainty in the computer industry that they say will - 2 - persist
   until the case is finally resolved, without specifying any imminent
   harm to consumers. (Appellees' Br. at 7.) Yet, as appellees concede,
   this supposed uncertainty has done nothing to stop "Microsoft and other
   market participants" from continuing "to develop and introduce new
   products." (Id.) Although Appellees are correct that the Supreme Court
   does not routinely grant cer- tiorari in cases where final judgment has
   not been entered, they ignore the established excep- tion to that rule.
   (See Appellees' Br. at 2-3.) Where, as here, "there is some important
   and clear-cut issue of law that is fundamental to the further conduct
   of the case and that would otherwise qualify as a basis for certiorari,
   the case may be reviewed despite its interlocutory status." ROBERT L.
   STERN ET AL., SUPREME COURT PRACTICE § 4.18, at 196 (7th ed. 1993).
   Whether a showing of actual bias is necessary to disqualify a judge as
   of the date of his earliest known violation of 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) is an
   important issue of law that is funda- mental to the further conduct of
   this litigation. If the district court's findings of fact and con-
   clusions of law-entered while he was legally disqualified under 28
   U.S.C. § 455(a)-are vacated, that would render invalid any actions
   taken on remand in reliance on those findings and conclusions. Judicial
   efficiency alone counsels in favor of waiting the short time it will
   take the Supreme Court to decide whether to grant Microsoft's petition.
   With regard to appellees' purported concern about "piecemeal appeals"
   (see Appellees' Br. at 3), this is not a case in which a party is
   seeking "to halt ... the orderly progress of a cause and consider inci-
   dentally a question which has happened to cross the path of such
   litigation and which is wholly independent of it." Segurola v. United
   States, 275 U.S. 106, 112 (1927) (quoted in Cobbledick v. United
   States, 309 U.S. 323, 326 (1940)). The question raised by Microsoft's
   petition is not peripheral; it goes to the very heart of the case. - 3
   - Appellants are wrong in arguing that the proper remedy for the
   district court's vio- lations of 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) is vested solely in
   this Court's discretion. (See Appellees' Br. at 4-5.) What the Supreme
   Court stated in Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486
   U.S. 847, 862 (1988), was that it would afford "due consideration" to
   the judgment of a court of appeals as to the proper remedy for a
   violation of 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) because in most cases the court of
   appeals "is in a better position to evaluate the significance of the
   violation." This Court held that the district judge's violations of 28
   U.S.C. § 455(a) were highly significant. In fact, the Court noted that
   "[t]he rampant disregard for the judiciary's ethical obligations that
   the public witnessed in this case undoubtedly jeopardizes `public
   confidence in the inte- grity' of the District Court proceedings." (Op.
   at 117 (quoting Canon 2A of the Code of Conduct of United States
   Judges).) Given the severity of the misconduct at issue, and its
   acknowledged adverse impact on the public's perception of the
   judiciary, Microsoft has asked the Supreme Court to consider whether
   this Court erred by requiring a showing of actual bias before setting
   aside findings of fact and conclusions of law entered while the
   district judge was disqualified under 28 U.S.C. § 455(a). Actual bias
   is not one of the three factors enumerated by the Supreme Court in
   Liljeberg that appellees say the Court should weigh in fashioning a
   remedy for violations of 28 U.S.C. § 455(a). (See Appellees' Br. at 4.)
   To the extent other courts of appeals have said that actual bias is
   relevant to the scope of disqualification, those decisions also
   conflict with United States v. Cooley, 1 F.3d 985 (10th Cir. 1993), and
   Preston v. United States, 923 F.2d 731 (9th Cir. 1991). Making actual
   bias the "[m]ost important" factor in determining the proper remedy for
   a violation of 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) (Op. at 122) is particularly
   unjustified when the actions giving rise to the disqualification were
   neither inadvertent nor obscure but - 4 - rather were deliberate and
   blatantly improper. Finally, appellate review of the record-no matter
   how painstaking-cannot remedy the public perception of injustice when
   the ex parte communications at issue occurred not in the courtroom but
   behind closed doors, off the record, and were actively concealed by the
   district judge. (See Appellees' Br. at 4.) Thus, giving "due
   consideration" to this Court's views-including its acknowledgement that
   "there is fair room for argument that the District Court's factfindings
   should be vacated in toto" (Op. at 124)-the Supreme Court could well
   conclude that this Court erred as a matter of law in not disqualifying
   the district judge as of the date of his earliest known violation of 28
   U.S.C. § 455(a). Appellees' effort to distinguish Preston and Cooley is
   unpersuasive. (See Appellees' Br. at 5-6.) Neither case turned on the
   fact that the conduct giving rise to the disqualification occurred
   before the relevant proceeding began. Even if timing were the critical
   factor, the decisions in Preston and Cooley do not support appellees'
   contention that it is permissible to uphold actions taken by a district
   judge when he is disqualified by statute from adjudicating a case.
   Instead, by parity of reasoning, the district judge here was
   disqualified as soon as the conduct giving rise to the violations of 28
   U.S.C. § 455(a) began. Appellees take Microsoft to task for not
   addressing In re School Asbestos Litig., 977 F.2d 764 (3d Cir. 1992),
   and In re Allied Signal Inc., 891 F.2d 974 (1st Cir. 1989), in its stay
   motion. (Appellees' Br. at 6.) They neglect to mention, however, that
   Microsoft distin- guished both decisions in its petition for a writ of
   certiorari. (See Petition at 23 n.7 & 24 n.8.) In the Third Circuit
   case, the disqualified judge's summary judgment decisions were subject
   to de novo review on appeal, and his decisions regarding trial
   procedure were open to reconsideration by the new district judge, so
   the court saw no need to vacate those decisions. - 5 - In re Sch.
   Asbestos Litig., 977 F.2d at 787. Here, the district court's findings
   of fact were not subject to de novo review on appeal. To the contrary,
   to Microsoft's substantial prejudice, those findings received
   substantial deference under the "clearly erroneous" standard of Rule
   52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In the First Circuit
   case, the court noted that the parties seeking disqualification "have
   not pointed to any specific findings or rulings already made in the ...
   litigation that are incura- ble or could have preclusive effect in some
   other action." In re Allied Signal, Inc., 891 F.2d at 973. As Microsoft
   has observed, nothing in the district court's findings of fact is
   "curable" at this stage of the case, and the plaintiffs in the more
   than 150 private class actions pending against Microsoft around the
   country are sure to argue that certain of those findings should have
   preclusive effect. Appellees' reliance on United States v. Cerceda, 172
   F.3d 806 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (per curiam), is utterly misplaced.
   In Cerceda, the Eleventh Circuit examined the three factors set forth
   in Liljeberg to determine the appropriate remedy for a violation of 28
   U.S.C. § 455 (a). The court's discussion of those three factors
   supports Microsoft's position. As to the first factor, i.e., the risk
   of injustice to the parties in the case, the court stated that the
   relevant considerations were (i) the existence of circumstances that
   might indicate a risk of injustice to the party seeking
   disqualification, and (ii) the seriousness of the violation of 28
   U.S.C. § 455(a) involved. Cerceda, 172 F.3d at 813. The court also
   noted that the party opposing vacatur bears the burden of showing that
   a new trial would impose "special hard- ship" on it. Id. at 814. At a
   minimum, the fact that the district judge in this case expressed to a
   reporter "his distaste for the defense of technical integration-one of
   the central issues in the lawsuit" (Op. at 109)-two months before he
   issued his findings of fact is a circumstance that - 6 - does-not just
   might-indicate a risk of injustice to Microsoft. Moreover, it is agreed
   by all parties that the district judge's many violations of 28 U.S.C. §
   455(a) were extremely serious. Finally, while appellees would be
   required to devote resources to a retrial of the case, there are going
   to be substantial proceedings on remand in any event, and there is no
   basis for asserting that the delay between the original trial and a new
   trial would seriously compromise appellees' ability to prove their
   claims. All of the witnesses who testified in the original trial are
   alive and well. Cf. Cerceda, 172 F.3d at 815 (key government witness 84
   years old and in poor health at time of original trial, six years
   earlier). As to the second Liljeberg factor, i.e., the risk that the
   denial of relief will produce injustice in other cases, the Eleventh
   Circuit noted that its judicial council had recently adopted a protocol
   that would make it very unlikely that conduct at issue would recur.
   Cerceda, 172 F.3d at 815. No parallel change in ethical rules has
   occurred in this case, and the violations committed by the district
   judge are so extreme that they demand strong reme- dial action to deter
   other judges from engaging in similar misconduct. That is particularly
   true given that this Court previously admonished the district judge for
   engaging in similar misconduct. See In re Barry, 946 F.2d 913, 914
   (D.C. Cir. 1991); see also Ronald D. Rotunda, Judicial Comments on
   Pending Cases: The Ethical Restrictions and Sanctions-A Case Study of
   the Microsoft Litigation, 2001 UNIV. ILL. L. REV. 611, 627 ("The remedy
   of reversal should be more likely in the situation where an appellate
   court has already warned the judge not to engage in such extrajudicial
   comments."). As to the third Liljeberg factor, i.e., the risk of
   undermining public confidence in the judicial process, the Eleventh
   Circuit stressed that the ethical violation at issue was "neither
   egregious nor clear cut." Cerceda, 172 F.3d at 815-16. As a result, the
   court held that - 7 - vacating the convictions of large numbers of
   defendants convicted of serious crimes based solely on a technical
   violation of 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) would actually undermine public confi-
   dence in the judicial process because the proceedings leading to those
   convictions "seemed completely fair." Id. at 816. Here, the Court has
   found that the district judge's ethical viola- tions were "deliberate,
   repeated, egregious and flagrant." (Op. at 106.) In addition, the dis-
   trict judge's conduct was anything but fair. As this Court stated,
   "[t]he public cannot be expected to maintain confidence in the
   integrity and impartiality of the judiciary in the face of such
   conduct." (Op. at 117.) In short, Cerceda buttresses Microsoft's
   position that this Court should have disquali- fied the district judge
   as of the date of his earliest known violation of 28 U.S.C. § 455(a),
   not some eight months later, after he had decided critical issues in
   the case. By not giving effect to the disqualification until eight
   months after the district judge's first known violation of 28 U.S.C. §
   455(a)-primarily because of the absence of proof of actual bias-this
   Court's decision conflicts with Liljeberg itself, as well as with
   Preston and Cooley. That conflict raises a substantial question worthy
   of the Supreme Court's consideration, and this Court should stay
   issuance of its mandate until the Supreme Court decides whether to
   grant Microsoft's pending petition. - 8 - For the foregoing reasons, as
   well as for the reasons stated in Microsoft's motion, Microsoft
   respectfully requests the Court to stay issuance of its mandate pending
   final disposition of Microsoft's petition for a writ of certiorari in
   the Supreme Court. Respectfully submitted,
