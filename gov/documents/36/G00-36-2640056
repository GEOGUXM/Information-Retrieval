Data Products by Discipline

   NPOESS will employ new advanced sensors that will greatly improve
   currently available measurements and provide vital new operational
   measurements presently only available as research products.

   The sensors will continuously gather and distribute data about Earth's
   disciplines as shown in the lists that appear next to each of the
   following images. Click on the image to get more information about the
   sensors used to gather this data. (If the lists don't appear, see our
   information about JavaScript or see the non-JavaScript version of the
   lists.)
