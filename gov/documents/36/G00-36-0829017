                      How can I get information on the
                         IHS Loan Repayment Program?

   The purpose of the Indian Health Service (IHS) Loan Repayment Program
   (LRP) is to recruit and retain highly qualified health professionals to
   meet the staffing needs of the IHS or an Indian health program.

   All health professions are eligible to apply to the Loan Repayment
   Program. However, physicians and nurses have historically received the
   highest priority for selection into the program.

   LRP applicants must be health or allied health professionals who:
     * are U.S. citizens;
     * are committed to practice at an IHS or other Indian health program
       priority site, demonstrated by enclosing a signed contract to serve
       at such a site;
     * are free to begin service on or before September 30 in a full-time
       clinical practice for two continuous years in an approved IHS or
       other Indian health program priority site; and
     * meet the definition given in Section 4(n) of the Indian Health Care
       Improvement Act (IHCIA), Public Law (P.L.) 94-437, as amended,
       that:

     Health Profession means family medicine, internal medicine,
     pediatrics, geriatric medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, podiatric
     medicine, nursing, public health nursing, dentistry, psychiatry,
     osteopathy, optometry, pharmacy, psychology, public health, social
     work, marriage and family therapy, chiropractic medicine,
     environmental health and engineering and allied health professions.
     * have a degree in medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, or health
       profession consistent with Section 4(n); and have completed an
       approved graduate training program in medicine, osteopathy,
       dentistry, or other health profession in a State, and have a
       llicense to practice medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, or, if
       applicable, other health profession in a State, except that the
       Secretary may waive the requirement of graduate training for good
       cause shown.
