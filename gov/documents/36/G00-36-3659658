                             Research Highlights

    Soil Hydraulic Properties

    Preferential movement of surface applied chemicals to the groundwater
   has resulted in a need to physically model the movement of water into
   and through the soil. Knowledge of the matrix and macropore soil
   hydraulic properties is critical to describing these field scale
   processes. Methods were developed using fractal principles to describe
   macropores. The Marshall saturated hydraulic conductivity equation was
   modified to predict the hydraulic conductivity based on soil
   properties. This development enables the use of domain concept for
   modeling both macropores and matrix flow in soils; thus, allowing the
   identification of potential pollutant paths and the evaluation of
   agricultural practices on these paths

                Environmental Fate of Agricultural Chemicals

                 Corn rows from Tilled and no-tilled fields

    Volatilization and leaching losses of agricultural chemicals are not
   only an economic loss to the farmer but pose a threat to water quality.
    If truly sustainable production systems are to be developed, methods
    for accurately quantifying the effect of various production practices
   on chemical behavior must be developed. Recently, complex photographic
    techniques and image analysis of a soluble dye were linked to bromide
     tracer and pesticide leachate concentrations so that the effect of
    tillage on spatial flow patterns could be determined and visualized.
      Visual observations and chemical breakthrough curves showed that
   preferential chemical transport was common under both tillage regimes.
       However unlike the flow pathways observed in the tilled field,
   no-tillage flow pathways were associated with bio-pores. The bio-pores
    were not only effective in transporting the applied chemical but gave
      evidence of enhanced microbial activity. As a result, linkage of
     preferential flow pathways and microbial activity will not only be
       paramount to the development of production systems but also for
     modeling efforts that attempt to accurately simulate the impact of
                    agricultural chemicals in the field.

   Grass Hedges for Erosion Control

      Concentrated flow erosion is a major concern in agricultural areas
      around the world. In a series of recent studies, quantitative data has
      been collected showing that narrow, stiff grass hedges act as a filter
      to slow and broaden the flow area, resulting in ponding that increases
      settling times for suspended material to be deposited. This causes the
      development of terraces that further reduce the steepness of slopes
      giving even larger areas for the water to spread. Narrow, stiff grass
      hedges should not be seen as a panacea but as another tool to control
      soil loss from agricultural fields. Stiff grass hedges are an
      alternative conservation practice for reducing soil loss and dispersing
      runoff from areas of concentrated flow erosion in agricultural fields.

                     Spatially Distributed Basin Fluxes

   Sensors attached to a yoke enable workers to gather data on vegetation
   and soil properties The capability to compute spatially distributed
   energy and water fluxes over a basin is essential for identifying
   sources and sinks of hydrologic, atmospheric and biogeochemical fluxes.
   Remote sensing information provides key spatial information which has
   been used in operational models for extrapolating local fluxes to whole
   basins. This technique has been tested at field and basin scales over
   agricultural and natural landscapes. For area averaged regional scale
   fluxes, similarity formulations for the atmospheric boundary layer have
   been combined with surface temperature and reflectance data collected
   over large areas. The models developed are the first of their kind for
   computing all components of the energy balance in a spatially
   distributed manner using primarily remote sensing technology in climate
   and hydrologic research. The model-derived fluxes will provide one of
   the few independent methods for evaluating new techniques and concepts
   used in prognostic hydrologic and climate models for computing
   spatially distributed fluxes at regional scales.

      Measuring Landscape Properties Using an Airborne Laser Altimeter

   Measurement of landscape surface properties have been made using a
   laser altimeter mounted in an airplane and analyzed to provide data on
   topography, surface roughness, stream and gully cross-sections and
   vegetation canopy properties. Laser measurements of vegetation cover
   and height were correlated to ground measurements made with line
   intercept methods. Measurements of topography can contribute to a
   better quantification of the movement of water over landscape surfaces.
   Airborne laser altimeters offer the potential to measure large areas
   quickly and easily, providing valuable data for understanding and
   managing natural resources at large scales. Dr. Ritchie monitoring

   Gathering snow depth data

                             Climate Change Effects on Water Supply

   A hydrological model is the best tool known today to project the
   potential effects of climate change on water supply. Because the
   majority of water in the West comes from snowmelt, the Snowmelt Runoff
   Model (SRM) has been employed for such projections. In addition to
   changes in temperature and precipitation which can be input directly,
   an algorithm has been developed that calculates changes in basin snow
   cover under the new climate. It has been discovered that many model
   parameters, overlooked by other investigators, will also change in a
   response to the changing climate. Use of SRM under conditions of
   climate change has shown that the spring runoff peak will shift by 2-4
   weeks earlier in the year. The average proportion of winter
   runoff/summer runoff in the Rockies will change from 13/87% to 28/72%.
   Water resources management for irrigation, hydropower, and domestic
   supplies will have to change to keep pace with the changes in climate.

   ARS Water Database

      The ARS Water Database is a collection of precipitation and streamflow
      data from small agricultural watersheds in the United States. This
      national archive of variable time-series readings for precipitation and
      runoff contains over 16,000 station years of data. Watersheds used as
      study areas range from .2 hectare (0.5 acres) to 12,400 square
      kilometers (4,786 square miles). Raingage networks range from one
      station per watershed to over 200 stations. The period of record for
      individual watersheds vary from 1 to 50 years. Various types of
      ancillary data include maximum-minimum daily air temperature, land
      management practices, topography and soils information. These data are
      useful to researchers, hydrologists and engineers for climate change
      studies, hydrologic modeling and comparing management strategies. A
      CD-ROM is available with management software designed to run in a
      Microsoft Windows environment. Internet access is available using the

   Successive Soil Moisture images showing drying down of the soil

New Antenna Technology Evaluated for Soil Moisture Applications

   A multibeam aircraft passive microwave radiometer using new synthetic
   aperture technology was built and installed on a NASA aircraft. Through
   the cooperative efforts of ARS, NASA, and the University of
   Massachusetts, the performance of the prototype instrument was
   successfully verified in two large-scale experiments. In Walnut Gulch,
   AZ, a short duration experiment showed that soil moisture estimates had
   accuracies comparable with ground sampling and other aircraft sensors.
   A longer duration experiment in the Little Washita watershed, OK
   involved mapping over 600 sq. km at a 200m resolution every day for an
   eight day period. The resulting data revealed significant spatial
   patterns in soil moisture that have been associated with the soil
   texture distribution of the region.

   Estimating Surface Temperature Remotely

      Surface temperature is a key remotely sensed variable for estimating
      the partitioning of available surface energy into heat and moisture
      fluxes from the surface to the atmosphere. However, the emissivity of
      the surface must be known in order to convert radiometric temperature
      measured with remotely sensed data to a physically meaningful
      temperature. Appropriate values of that parameter for semi-arid
      ecosystems are not well known. Ground-based remotely sensed data were
      used to estimate surface emissivity for two very typical semi-arid
      ecosystems (desert grasslands and shrubland).

      semi-arid area during HAPEX-Sahel. Hydrology. pp. 285-309.

   Interdisciplinary Field Experiments

      An essential element of research in hydrology is the collection,
      analysis and interpretation of experimental data for developing and
      testing hypotheses, which eventually leads to improved modeling of
      hydrological processes. Hydrology and Remote Sensing Lab scientists
      have lead or participated in a wide range of field studies. They
      include NASA supported large scale field experiments for improved
      modeling of land surface and climate processes and for evaluating the
      utility of remote sensing (HAPEX-Mobilhy, FIFE, HAPEX-Sahel, Monsoon
      '90, Washita '92, Washita '94 and SGP '97) and USDA sponsored studies
      related to Global Climate Change (Jornex '95, '96, '97). Data from
      these studies are being used by Hydrology and Remote Sensing Lab
      scientists and cooperators for improving model parametrizations of
      hydrologic and atmospheric processes and for evaluating the utility of
      remote sensing in providing spatial and temporal information of key
      landscape variables including soil moisture, vegetation cover, snow
   cover, surface roughness and topography, and surface temperature.
