                   California Department of Fish and Game
             National Marine Fisheries Service Southwest Region
                            Joint Hatchery Review

   The California Department of Fish and Game and the National Marine
   Fisheries Service Southwest Region recently completed a review of the
   salmon and steelhead hatcheries operated by CDFG. The review was
   initiated to discuss salmon and steelhead hatchery policies and
   practices in light of the listing of many of Californias salmon and
   steelhead populations under the state and federal endangered species
   acts. The two agencies have jointly issued a report with
   recommendations which will be submitted to the CDFG Director the NMFS
   Southwest Regional Administrator for their consideration and approval.

   A copy of the Draft Report can be downloaded as a PDF file, which must
   be viewed and printed using Adobe Acrobat Reader. It consists of the
   main report (40 pages) followed by several appendices (50 pages).

   It should be noted that this report deals only with hatcheries that
   produce salmon and steelhead, and not with those producing resident
   trout. Your interest in the future use of Californias salmon and
   steelhead hatcheries and comments on this draft report will be
   appreciated.
