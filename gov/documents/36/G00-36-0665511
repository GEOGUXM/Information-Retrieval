                              Mars Team Online

                         A Guided Tour of this Site

   In 1996 NASA launched two missions to Mars. The Mars Global Surveyor
   spacecraft took off in November and reached the orbit of Mars on
   September 11, 1997 to begin an orbital mission that will provide
   detailed mapping and weather information. The Mars Pathfinder
   spacecraft blasted away in December and landed on the Red Planet on
   July 4, 1997. The micro-rover Sojourner has wandered its way around the
   Martian terrain, returning a wealth of new science data.

   By participating in the Mars Team Online project, you and your students
   can join the Mars team in their exploration of the Red Planet! The
   project is targeted at the middle school grade levels, but will have
   appeal above and below that range.
