   Space Science Missions - Quick Links

   We have quite a few missions, some well-known and others not so well
   known. Many involve cooperation with international partners or other
   U.S. agencies. The links below will take you directly to the mission's
   home page; for full names and brief descriptions of these missions,
   click on the column headings (i.e., Under study, In development,
   Operating, or Past missions). We also have a page for potential
   missions beyond 2007.

   history of Space Science from the 1940s to present.
   Multi-Mission Programs

   The following programs include multiple missions, many of which are
   linked above. You can see brief descriptions of these programs, along
   with links to them, here.
     * Discovery Program
     * Explorer Program
     * International Solar-Terrestrial Physics
     * Living With a Star
     * Mars Exploration program at JPL
     * New Millennium
     * Scientific Balloons
     * Solar-Terrestrial Probes
     * Sounding Rockets

   Ground-Based Astronomy

   Most of our research activities are carried out using spacecraft
   (earth-orbiting or interplanetary) or suborbital vehicles (sounding
   rockets, balloons, and high-altitude aircraft). The National Science
   Foundation is the government agency that is responsible for most U.S.
   ground-based astronomical research. However, we do support a few
   ground-based activities, including:
     * the search for planets outside of our solar system
     * NASA's share of observing time on the Keck telescopes
     * development (and eventual use of) the Keck Interferometer
     * the Infrared Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea
     * the 2 Micron All-Sky Survey
     * solar observations at Mt. Wilson, including the 60-foot and
       150-foot tower telescopes
     * Near-Earth object detection, tracking, and characterization,
       including

     * the University of Arizona Spacewatch program
     * Near Earth Asteroid Tracking, a team led by JPL
     * Lowell Observatory Near-Earth Object Search

   Non-Space Science missions
     * Earth Science missions
     * Space Shuttle, Space Station, and prior human space missions
       (Gemini, Apollo, etc.)
