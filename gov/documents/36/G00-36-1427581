                                Asteroid 243 Ida

   [ida.jpg]

   This view of the asteroid 243 Ida is a mosaic of five image frames
   acquired by the Galileo spacecraft's solid-state imaging system at
   ranges of 3,057 to 3,821 kilometers (1,900 to 2,375 miles) on August
   28, 1993, about 3-1/2 minutes before the spacecraft made its closest
   approach to the asteroid. Galileo flew about 2,400 kilometers (1,500
   miles) from Ida at a relative velocity of 12.4 km/sec (28,000 mph).
   Asteroid and spacecraft were 441 million kilometers (274 million miles)
   from the Sun.

   Ida is the second asteroid ever encountered by a spacecraft. It appears
   to be about 52 kilometers (32 miles) in length, more than twice as
   large as Gaspra, the first asteroid observed by Galileo in October
   1991. Ida is an irregularly shaped asteroid placed by scientists in the
   S class (believed to be like stony or stony iron meteorites). It is a
   member of the Koronis family, presumed fragments left from the breakup
   of a precursor asteroid in a catastrophic collision. This view shows
   numerous craters, including many degraded craters larger than any seen
   on Gaspra. The extensive cratering seems to dispel theories about Ida's
   surface being geologically youthful. This view also seems to rule out
   the idea that Ida is a double body. The south pole is believed to be in
   the dark side near the middle of the asteroid.

   The camera's clear filter was used to produce this extremely sharp
   picture. Spatial resolution is 31 to 38 meters (roughly 100 feet) per
   pixel. A 30-frame mosaic was taken to assure capturing Ida; its
   position was somewhat uncertain before the Galileo encounter. Galileo
   shuttered and recorded a total of 150 images in order to capture Ida 21
   different times during a five hour period (about one rotation of the
   asteroid). Color filters were used at many of these times to allow
   reconstruction of color images. Playback to Earth of the remaining
   images is planned for April through June 1994.

   The Galileo project, whose primary mission is the exploration of the
   Jupiter system in 1995-97, is managed for NASA's Office of Space
   Science by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
