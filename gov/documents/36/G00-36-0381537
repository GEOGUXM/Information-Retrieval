     Mission Statement

     ICCVAM and its supporting center, NICEATM (the National Toxicology
   Program Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative
   Toxicological Methods), coordinate the development, validation,
   acceptance, and harmonization of alternative toxicological test methods
   throughout the U.S. Federal government.
   ICCVAM and NICEATM promote both scientific validation and regulatory
   acceptance of alternative test methods that predict human and
   ecological effects better than currently used methods.  ICCVAM and
   NICEATM focus efforts on alternatives that may improve toxicity
   characterization, increase savings in time and cost, and even refine,
   reduce, or replace animal use.
