   First set is free. Subsequent copies cost $25. In 1957, the Department
   published Bulletin 3, the California Water Plan. Bulletin 3 was
   followed by the Bulletin 160 series, published seven times between 1966
   and 1998 to update the California Water Plan. Bulletin 160 assesses
   California's agricultural, environmental, and urban water needs and
   evaluates water supplies to quantify the gap between existing and
   forecasted future water demands and the corresponding water supplies.
   The series presents a statewide overview of current water management
   activities and provides water man- agers and others with a framework
   for making water resources decisions. Bulletin 160 is updated and
   published every five years as mandated by law. Bulletin 170-98:
