      100 Water Saving Tips from "Water. Use it wisely"

      #1. There are a number of ways to save water, and they all start with
      you.
      #2. When washing dishes by hand, don't let the water run while rinsing.
      Fill one sink with wash water and the other with rinse water.
      #3. Evaporative coolers require a seasonal maintenance checkup. For
      more efficient cooling, check your evaporative cooler annually.
      #4. Check your sprinkler system frequently and adjust sprinklers so
      only your lawn is watered and not the house, sidewalk, or street.
      #5. Run your washing machine and dishwasher only when they are full and
      you could save 1000 gallons a month.
      #6. Avoid planting turf in areas that are hard to water such as steep
      inclines and isolated strips along sidewalks and driveways.
      #7. Install covers on pools and spas to avoid water evaporation.
      #8. Use the garbage disposal less often.
      #9. Plant during the spring or fall when the watering requirements are
      lower.
      #10. Keep a pitcher of water in the refrigerator instead of running the
      tap for cold drinks.
      #11. Check your water meter and bill to track your water usage.
      #12. Always water during the early morning hours, when temperatures are
      cooler, to minimize evaporation.
      #13. Wash your produce in the sink or a pan that is partially filled
      with water instead of running water from the tap.
      #14. Use a layer of organic mulch around plants to reduce evaporation,
      promote plant growth, and reduce weeds.
      #15. Use a broom instead of a hose to clean your driveway and sidewalk
      and save up to 80 gallons of water every time.
      #16. If your shower can fill a one-gallon bucket in less than 20
      seconds, then replace it with a water-efficient showerhead.
      #17. Reuse the water that you washed produce in for watering house
      plants or for cleaning.
      #18. Water your lawn in several short sessions rather than one long
      one. This will allow the water to be better absorbed.
      #19. We're more likely to notice leaky faucets indoors, but don't
      forget to check outdoor faucets, pipes, and hoses for leaks.
      #20. Periodically check your pool for leaks if you have an automatic
      refilling device.
      #21. Only water your lawn when needed. You can tell this by simply
      walking across your lawn. If you leave footprints, it's time to water.
      #22. When you shop for a new appliance, keep in mind that one offering
      several different cycles will be more water and energy-efficient.
      #23. Time your shower to keep it under 5 minutes. You'll save up to
      1000 gallons a month.
      #24. Install low-volume toilets.
      #25. Adjust your lawn mower to a higher setting. Longer grass will
      reduce the loss of water to evaporation.
      #26. When you clean your fish tank, use the water you've drained on
      your plants. The water is rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, providing
      you with a free and effective fertilizer.
      #27. Water small areas of grass by hand to avoid waste.
      #28. Put food coloring in your toilet tank. If it seeps into the bowl,
      you have a leak. It's easy to fix, and can save more than 600 gallons a
      month.
      #29. Plug the bathtub before turning the water on, then adjust the
      temperature as the tub fills up.
      #30. Use porous materials for walkways and patios to keep water in your
      yard and prevent wasteful runoff.
      #31. Collect and use rain water for watering your garden. (Check to
      make sure this is legal in your area.)
      #32. Designate one glass for your drinking water each day. This will
      cut down on the number of times you run your dishwasher.
      #33. Instead of using a hose or a sink to get rid of paints, motor oil,
      and pesticides, dispose of them properly by recycling or sending them
      to a hazardous waste site.
      #34. Install a rain shut-off device on your automatic sprinklers to
      eliminate unnecessary watering.
      #35. Don't use running water to thaw food.
      #36. Choose a water-efficient drip irrigation for your trees, shrubs,
      and flowers.
      #37. Grab a wrench and fix that leaky faucet. It's simple, inexpensive,
      and can save 140 gallons a week.
      #38. Cut back on the amount of grass in your yard by planting shrubs
      and ground cover or landscaping with rock.
      #39. When doing laundry, match the water level to the size of the load.
      #40. Teach your children to turn the faucets off tightly after each
      use.
      #41. Remember to check your sprinkler system valves periodically for
      leaks and keep the heads in good shape.
      #42. Before you lather up, install a low-flow showerhead. They're
      inexpensive, easy to install, and can save your family more than 500
      gallons a week.
      #43. Soak your pots and pans instead of letting the water run while you
      scrape them clean.
      #44. Don't water your lawn on windy days.
      #45. Water deeply but less frequently to create healthier and stronger
      landscapes.
      #46. Make sure you know where your master water shut-off valve is
      located. This could save gallons of water and damage to your home if a
      pipe were to burst.
      #47. When watering grass on steep slopes, use a soaker hose to prevent
      wasteful runoff.
      #48. To get the most from your watering time, group your plants
      according to their water needs.
      #49. Remember to weed your lawn and garden regularly. Weeds compete
      with other plants for nutrients, light, and water.
      #50. While fertilizers promote plant growth, they also increase water
      consumption. Apply the minimum amount of fertilizer needed.
      #51. Avoid installing ornamental water features unless the water is
      being recycled.
      #52. Use a commercial car wash that recycles water.
      #53. Don't buy recreational water toys that require a constant flow of
      water.
      #54. Turn off the water while you brush your teeth and save 4 gallons a
      minute. That's 200 gallons each week for a family of four.
      #55. Buy a rain gauge to track how much rain or irrigation your yard
      receives.
      #56. Encourage your school system and local government to help develop
      and promote a water conservation ethic among children and adults.
      #57. Teach your family how to shut off your automatic watering systems
      so anyone who is home can turn sprinklers off when a storm is
      approaching.
      #58. Set a kitchen timer when watering your lawn by sprinkler or hose.
      #59. Make sure your toilet flapper doesn't stick open after flushing.
      #60. Make sure there are aerators on all of your faucets.
      #61. Next time you add or replace a flower or shrub, choose a low water
      use plant and save up to 550 gallons each year.
      #62. Install an instant water heater on your kitchen sink so you don't
      have to let the water run while it heats up. This will also reduce
      heating costs for your household.
      #63. Use a grease pencil to mark the water level of your pool at the
      skimmer. Check the mark 24 hours later. Your pool should lose no more
      than 1/4 inch each day.
      #64. Spot spray or remove weeds as they appear.
      #65. Use a screwdriver as a soil probe to test soil moisture.
      #66. Install a drip irrigation system around your trees and shrubs to
      water more efficiently.
      #67. Mow your lawn as infrequently as possible. Mowing puts your lawn
      under additional stress, causing it to require more water.
      #68. Don't use the sprinklers just to cool off or for play. Running
      through water from a hose or sprinkler wastes gallons of water.
      #69. Make sure your swimming pools, fountains, and ponds are equipped
      with recirculating pumps.
      #70. Bathe your young children together.
      #71. Direct downspouts or gutters toward shrubs or trees.
      #72. Winterize outdoor spigots to avoid pipes from bursting or
      freezing.
      #73. Insulate hot water pipes so you don't have to run as much water to
      get hot water to the faucet.
      #74. Drop that tissue in the trash instead of flushing it and save
      gallons every time.
      #75. Wash your car on the grass. This will water the lawn at the same
      time.
      #76. If you have an evaporative air conditioner, direct the water drain
      to a flower bed, tree, or your lawn.
      #77. Make suggestions to your employer to save water (and dollars) at
      work.
      #78. Use a hose nozzle and turn off the water while you wash your car
      to save more than 100 gallons.
      #79. Support projects that use reclaimed waste water for irrigation and
      other uses.
      #80. Encourage your friends and neighbors to be part of a
      water-conscious community.
      #81. Install a toilet dam or bottle filled with water in your toilet
      tank to cut down on the amount of water used for each flush. Be sure
      these devices do not interfere with operating parts.
      #82. Install water softening systems only when necessary. Save water
      and salt by running the minimum number of regenerations necessary to
      maintain water softness.
      #83. Turn your water softeners off while you're on vacation.
      #84. Prune back heavy foliage. Reducing leaf area reduces water needs.
      #85. Report all significant water losses (broken pipes, open hydrants,
      errant sprinklers, abandoned free-flowing wells, etc.) to the property
      owner, local authorities, or your water management district.
      #86. If your grass is brown, it's not dead, it's just dormant. Dormant
      grass only needs to be watered every three weeks. When the rain begins,
      your grass will turn green again.
      #87. Start a compost pile. Using compost when you plant adds
      water-holding organic matter to the soil.
      #88. Listen for dripping faucets and toilets that flush themselves.
      Fixing a leak can save 500 gallons each month.
      #89. Use sprinklers that throw big drops of water close to the ground.
      Smaller drops of water and mist often evaporate before they hit the
      ground.
      #90. More plants die from over-watering than from under-watering. Be
      sure only to water plants when necessary.
      #91. Adjust your watering schedule to the season. Water your summer
      lawn every third day and your winter lawn every fifth day.
      #92. Cook food in as little water as possible. This will also retain
      more of the nutrients.
      #93. If it takes you more than a few minutes to shampoo and condition
      your hair, turn off the faucet while you work each in, then back on to
      rinse.
      #94. Bathe your pets outdoors in an area in need of water.
      #95. Choose new water-saving appliances, like washing machines that
      save up to 20 gallons per load.
      #96. Water only as rapidly as the soil can absorb the water.
      #97. Aerate your lawn. Punch holes in your lawn about six inches apart
      so water will reach the roots rather than run off the surface.
      #98. Select the proper size pans for cooking. Large pans require more
      cooking water than may be necessary.
      #99. Share wateruseitwisely.com with everyone you know.
      #100. There are a number of ways to save water, and they all
      start...and end...with you. Water. Use it Wisely.
