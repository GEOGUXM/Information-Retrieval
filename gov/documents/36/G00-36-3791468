                          ABOUT THE WEEKLY SUMMARY

   The Weekly Summary of NLRB cases, as the name implies, is a publication
   that summarizes each week all published NLRB decisions in unfair labor
   practice and representation election cases, except for summary judgment
   cases. It also lists all decisions of NLRB administrative law judges.
   Links are established from the weekly summary index to the summaries
   and from the summaries to the full text of the decisions.
