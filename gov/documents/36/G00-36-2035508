                                                              Summary
              _________________________________________________

    This study uses electomagnetic (EM) methods to map the location of the
                saltwater/freshwater interface in the Florida Everglades.

   This project addresses the question of determining the location of the
   fresh-water/salt-water interface (FWSWI) in the coastal regions of
   southern Dade and Monroe Counties, synoptic monitoring of changes in
   water quality associated with changes in water management practices,
   and looking for geophysical evidence of subsurface discharges of fresh
   water to Florida Bay.

   This project covers a 1036-square-kilometer region of the Everglades
   located in Everglades National Park and surrounding areas. The study
   area is bounded on the east by U.S. Highway 1, on the south by Florida
   Bay and Whitewater Sound, and on the far west by the mouths of the
   Harney River and Shark River Slough. From these boundaries the study
   area extends inland from 14 to 22 km.
