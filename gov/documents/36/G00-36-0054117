      Welcome to The Robotics Education Project. Our goal is to inform,
     inspire and involve people in the excitement of robotics. While we
    develop and encourage interactivity in learning, we strive to ensure
     the online safety and privacy of our users. The Robotics Education
     Project is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online
      Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). Notice of our information

                  (ii) Information Collected (16 CFR 312.4)

     A. General Collection Information

     As with all internet web sites, NASA REPcollects some information
     indirectly from all users visiting our web site. What is collected
     and how it is used is explained below.
     * System Logging. Our web server and e-mail systems keep log files
       about network transactions. NASA policy is to destroy these logs
       after they are 30 days old. We do analyze our web log files to
       calculate statistics on which pages are visited and how long
       visitors stay on our site. We do not track individuals with this
       information. We are required to retain this information for the
       security of our website and online service. E-mail addresses of
       messages sent from our system are logged as well. These logs are
       not viewed unless necessary for security reasons and are deleted
       after 30 days (16 CFR 312.5(c)(5)(i)).
     * Internet Addresses. NASA REPgathers Internet Protocol Address (IP
       Addresses) and pages viewed as part of the logging system within
       our web server. When calculating statistics on visits and pages
       viewed IP addresses are used in broad calculations. IP address are
       never used to identify someone personally unless a security breach
       requires such an investigation (16 CFR 312.5(c)(5)(i)).

     B. Email lists and surveys

     Occasionally, people may wish to join e-mail distribution lists. The
     only information requested is the address, school name and zip code
     of the school. This information is used to document our success in
     reaching various geographic areas in our country.
     * The Email Address is collected for us to send messages about NASA
       or NASA's web sites.
     * The date of birth may be collected to let us know that the right
       age groups like our site. We also require the birthday so that we
       may comply with the requirements of the Children's On-line Privacy
       Protection Act. The age is not associated with a name in this
       analysis.
     * The date of birth may be collected to let us know that the right
       age groups like our site. We also require the birthday so that we

       e-mail message. The format can either be plain text or, like a web
       page, in color.
     * The date added to the list is collected indirectly. If your child
       subsequently is removed from the list, we use this information to
