                          How to Apply for a Pardon

                             State of California

                           Office of the Governor

   Statement of Philosophy
     __________________________________________________________________

   A Governor's pardon is an honor usually granted only to individuals who
   have demonstrated a high standard of constructive behavior following
   conviction for a felony, or in some cases for certain specified
   misdemeanor sex offenses.  A pardon will not be issued unless it has
   been earned.  Obtaining a pardon is a distinct achievement based upon
   proof of a useful, productive, and law-abiding life following
   conviction.  It is a worthy and admirable goal, requiring sincere
   effort and commitment.

   In accord with the above philosophy, pardon applications will not be
   considered unless an applicant has been discharged from probation or
   parole for at least ten years and has not engaged in further criminal
   activity during that period.  While the receipt of a Certificate of
   Rehabilitation will be considered in evaluating a pardon application,
   it is but one factor and is not the sole determinant.  The ten-year
   rule may be waived in truly exceptional circumstances, if the applicant
   can demonstrate an earlier, specific need for the pardon.

   Once the above-discussed criteria have been met, the application will
   be reviewed to determine whether the applicant has met the standards
   set forth in California Penal Code section 4852.05, which states,
   "During the period of rehabilitation, the person shall live an honest
   and upright life, shall conduct himself or herself with sobriety and
   industry, shall exhibit a good moral character, and shall conform to
   and obey the laws of the land."

   Pardons
     __________________________________________________________________

   Any person who has been convicted in California of a felony, or a
   misdemeanor sex offense specified in Penal Code section 290, the
   accusatory pleading of which has been dismissed pursuant to Penal Code
   section 1203.4, may apply to the Governor for a pardon.  Applications
   for pardons may be made either by way of an application for a
   Certificate of Rehabilitation, or through a direct traditional pardon
   application.  The procedure utilized will depend on the circumstances
   of the applicant, as explained later.

   Once an application for a pardon is filed under either procedure, the
   Governor reviews the case.  The Governor has complete discretion in
   deciding whether to grant a pardon, and a pardon is not granted to
   every person who applies.  Pardon investigations are conducted for the
   Governor by the California Board of Prison Terms, Investigations
   Division.

   There are no county or state fees for applying for a pardon in
   California.

   Effect of a Pardon
     __________________________________________________________________

   When a Certificate of Rehabilitation or pardon is granted, the
   California Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of
   Investigation are notified.  These agencies records are then updated to
   show that a Certificate of Rehabilitation or a pardon has been granted
   in regard to the conviction.  A pardon is also filed with the Secretary
   of State, reported to the Legislature, and becomes a matter of public
   record.  Although no effort is made to publicize the pardon application
   or issuance, there is no guarantee that the issuance of a pardon to a
   particular person will not become known to the public.

   Restoration of Rights
     __________________________________________________________________

   The granting of a pardon entitles the applicant to exercise additional
   civil and political rights of citizenship.  The most frequent reasons
   people apply for a pardon are for personal satisfaction, for licensing
   or bonding purposes, and to restore firearms privileges.  Another
   frequent reason is to enhance employment opportunities, even when no
   legal disability exists.

   A pardon does not seal or expunge the record of the conviction.
   (California Penal Code section 4852.17.)  Prior convictions may be
   considered after the granting of a pardon, if the person is
   subsequently convicted of a new offense.

   A person who has been pardoned cannot state that he or she has no
   record of arrests or convictions.  The person can state that he or she
   has been convicted and has been pardoned.

   An ex-felon becomes eligible to vote after being terminated from
   probation or discharged from parole.  (California Constitution, article
   11, section 4.)  A pardon is not necessary to be eligible to vote.

   A person who receives a pardon may serve on a trial jury.  (California
   Code of Civil Procedure section 203(a)(5) and California Penal Code
   section 4852.17.)

   An ex-felon who receives a full and unconditional pardon can be
   considered for an appointment to a peace officer position as a county
   probation officer or state parole agent, but cannot hold other peace
   officer positions.  (California Government Code section 1029.)

   A person convicted of a felony cannot own, possess, or have access to
   any type of firearm, including a rifle or shotgun.  (California Penal
   Code section 12021.)  However, if a full and unconditional pardon is
   granted by the Governor, the person pardoned may own and possess any
   type of weapon that may lawfully be possessed and owned by other
   citizens in California.  The Governor cannot restore firearms rights to
   a person who has been convicted of any offense which involved the use
   of a dangerous weapon.  Pardons for out-of-state residents must
   specifically state that rights pertaining to firearms are restored.  A
   California pardon does not necessarily permit the possession of weapons
   under the laws of another state or the federal government.  The law
   pertaining to the restoration of rights to own and possess firearms can
   be found in California Penal Code section 4854.

   If you have not obtained a pardon restoring your firearms rights, and
   you have access to a firearm of any type, you are in violation of the
   law.  For example, having a firearm registered to a spouse, but readily
   available to you in your place of residence, is a violation.

   The granting of a pardon does not prevent some licensing agencies from
   considering the conviction which has been pardoned in its determination
   of whether a license to practice certain professions should be granted
   or restored.  The law pertaining to the effect of a full pardon on
   licensing boards can be found in California Penal Code section 4853.

   A California pardon does not apply to convictions suffered in another
   jurisdiction.  A person convicted in another state or in a federal
   court must apply for a pardon to the other state or the federal
   government.  Federal pardon information can be obtained by writing to
   the Pardon Attorney, U.S. Department of Justice, 500 First Street
   Northwest, Washington, DC  20530.

   Certificate of Rehabilitation
     __________________________________________________________________

   A Certificate of Rehabilitation is a court order which declares that a
   person who has been convicted of a felony is rehabilitated.  If a
   petition for a Certificate of Rehabilitation is granted, it is
   forwarded to the Governor by the granting court and constitutes an
   application for a pardon.

   The laws pertaining to the Certificate of Rehabilitation can be found
   in California Penal Code sections 4852.01 to 4852.21.

   Generally, a person who has been convicted in California of a felony,
   or a misdemeanor sex offense specified in California Penal Code section
   290, the accusatory pleading of which has been dismissed pursuant to
   Penal Code section 1203.4, may apply to the superior court in his or
   her county of residence for a Certificate of Rehabilitation, provided
   that he or she meets behavioral requirements and the applicable period
   of rehabilitation.  (California Penal Code section 4852.06.)  An
   exception to this rule involves individuals convicted of the following
   Penal Code sections:  286(c), 288, 288a(c), 288.5, and 289(j).
   Effective January 1, 1998, AB 729 amended Penal Code sections 1203.4
   and 4852.01 to prohibit these specified sex offenders from obtaining a
   Certificate of Rehabilitation.  Such individuals are no longer eligible
   to receive a Certificate of Rehabilitation.

   The granting of a Certificate of Rehabilitation relieves some offenders
   from the sexual offender registration requirement of Penal Code section
   290.  (See California Penal Code section 290.5 for a list of persons
   not eligible for relief from registration.)  To determine your 290
   registration status, contact the Department of Justice, Sexual
   Registration Unit.

   When to Apply
     __________________________________________________________________

   Persons eligible to petition for a Certificate of Rehabilitation may
   file the petition once the period of rehabilitation has passed. The
   period of rehabilitation begins to run upon the discharge of the
   petitioner from incarceration due to the completion of the term, or
   upon release on probation or parole.

   The period of rehabilitation constitutes five years residence in
   California, PLUS:
    1. Four years in the case of persons convicted of violation of
       California Penal Code sections 187, 209, 219, 4500, or 12310, or
       Military and Veterans Code section 1672(a), or of committing any
       other offense which carries a life sentence; or
    2. Five years in the case of any person convicted of any offense or
       attempted offense for which sex offender registration is required
       pursuant to P.C. 290, except for convictions for violations of
       subdivision (b), (c), or (d) of Section 311.2, or of Section 311.3,
       311.10, or 314.  For those convictions, two years shall be added to
       the five years imposed by this section.
    3. Two years in the case of any persons convicted of any offense not
       listed above and which does not carry a life sentence; or
    4. The number of additional years ordered by the trial court hearing
       the application for the Certificate of Rehabilitation in the case
       of a person serving consecutive sentences.

   Rescission of a Certificate of Rehabilitation
     __________________________________________________________________

   A district attorney in either the county of conviction or the county of
   residence may petition the superior court to rescind a certificate, if
   it was granted for any offense specified in California Penal Code
   section 290.

   Procedure for Applying
     __________________________________________________________________

   The petition must be filed in the superior court of the petitioner's
   current county of residence.  (California Penal Code section 4852.06.)
   A Petition for Certificate of Rehabilitation form and a Notice of
   Filing Petition form can usually be obtained from the county clerk;
   however, in some counties, the process is handled by the county public
   defender's office.  The petitioner is required to provide notice of
   their filing to the district attorney in their county of residence, as
   well as to the district attorney of each county in which the petitioner
   was convicted of a felony, and to the Governor's office.

   All felony convictions, or misdemeanor sex offenses specified in Penal
   Code section 290, for which the accusatory pleading was dismissed
   pursuant to California Penal Code section 1203.4, should be included.
   This notice must indicate the date and time of the hearing and must be
   sent to the district attorneys at least 30 days before the hearing.

   Each person who is eligible to initiate the Certificate of
   Rehabilitation proceedings is entitled to receive assistance in
   processing the petition from all rehabilitative agencies, including
   adult probation officers of the county, and state parole agents; and,
   in the case of persons under the age of 30, assistance can be obtained
   from the Youth Authority.  During the court proceedings, the petitioner
   may be represented by counsel of his or her own choosing.  If the
   petitioner does not have counsel, he or she may be represented by the
   public defender or by an adult probation officer.  The court may assign
   counsel to represent the petitioner if it feels that counsel is needed.

   Once a petition is filed, the court will schedule a hearing to consider
   the petition.  Prior to the hearing, the court may require an
   investigation by the district attorney of the county of residence of
   any and all matters pertaining to the petitioner.  At the hearing, the
   court may require testimony and the production of records and reports
   pertaining to the petitioner, including information about the
   conviction offense, and his or her conduct both while incarcerated and
   since release on probation or parole.

   If, after the hearing, the court finds that the petitioner has
   demonstrated rehabilitation and fitness to exercise all political and
   civil rights, the court may make an order declaring that the petitioner
   is rehabilitated.  A certified copy of the Certificate of
   Rehabilitation is then transmitted to the Governor and becomes an
   application for a pardon.

   Upon receipt of the application, the Governor may request that the
   Board of Prison Terms conduct a further investigation.  Following a
   review, the Governor may then grant the pardon.  If the petitioner has
   been convicted of more than one felony in separate proceedings, the
   California Supreme Court must also approve the grant of a pardon.

   Traditional Pardon
     __________________________________________________________________

   The traditional pardon procedure is available to those persons who are
   ineligible to petition for a Certificate of Rehabilitation.  This
   procedure is used primarily, although not exclusively, by California
   ex-felons who reside out-of-state and are therefore unable to satisfy
   the residency requirement.  The traditional pardon procedure is also
   available to those individuals who have convictions for Penal Code
   sections 286(c), 288, 288a(c), 288.5, and 289(j).  The traditional
   pardon procedure is covered by California Penal Code sections
   4800-4813.

   Applicants for a traditional pardon must write directly to the
   Governor's Office at the following address:


                              Governor's Office

                                State Capitol

                     Attention: Legal Affairs Secretary

                            Sacramento, CA 95814

   The letter should include:
    1. Why a pardon is desired or needed;
    2. Date and circumstances of all felony offenses of which the
       applicant was convicted;
    3. Dates the applicant was received in prison and released from
       custody or placed on probation;
    4. Name of the applicant, including any aliases; date of conviction;
       county and case number of conviction, if known; prison number; name
       of parole agent; current address and telephone number; and
    5. A brief, general statement of employment and activities since
       conviction or release from custody.

   Upon receipt of the letter, the Governor's Legal Affairs staff will
   review the information.  After the review, the Legal Affairs Office may
   send the Application for Executive Clemency and Notice of Intention to
   Apply for Executive Clemency forms to the applicant.

   The applicant should complete the Application for Executive Clemency
   form and have it notarized.  In addition, the Notice of Intention to
   Apply for Executive Clemency should be served on the District Attorney
   of each county in which the applicant was convicted of a felony, at
   least ten days prior to the application.

   The Acknowledgment of Receipt portion of the notice form must be
   completed and signed by the District Attorney.  Both the application
   and the completed notice must then be submitted to the Governor's
   Office, along with a full statement of any compensation paid to any
   person for assisting in the procurement of a pardon.

   Once the formal application is returned, the Governor refers it to the
   Board of Prison Terms for investigation.  After the investigation, the
   case is presented to the Executive Board for a decision as to whether
   to recommend to the Governor that a pardon be granted.  The applicant
   is notified of when the Board will be considering his or her case, and
   he or she is given the opportunity to forward any additional
   information, if desired.  Pardon applicants do not attend the pardon
   consideration meeting.  Following the meeting, the application,
   investigation report, and the Board's recommendation are sent to the
   Governor.  Notification of the meeting result is also sent to the
   applicant.

   The Governor then reviews all of the information and decides whether to
   grant a pardon.  If the applicant has been convicted of more than one
   felony in separate proceedings, the California Supreme Court must also
   approve the grant of a pardon.

   There is no requirement that the Governor issue a pardon to an
   applicant, and the length of time needed for the completion of the
   pardon process cannot be predicted.
