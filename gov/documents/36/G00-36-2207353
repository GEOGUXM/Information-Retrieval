                             Hawaiian Volcanoes

   The Hawaiian Islands are at the southeastern end of a chain of
   volcanoes that began to form more than 70 million years ago. Many of
   these volcanoes formed islands that have subsided and eroded beneath
   sea level, and some of the old volcanoes probably never reached sea
   level. Each Hawaiian island is made of one or more volcanoes, which
   first erupted on the sea floor and only emerged above the ocean's
   surface after countless eruptions.

   The largest and most southeastern island of the chain, Hawai`i,
   consists of five volcanoes. Kilauea, Mauna Loa, and Hualalai have
   erupted in the past 200 years. Lo`ihi, the youngest volcano of the
   Hawaiian Volcanic Chain, is still about 1,000 meters beneath the
   ocean's surface. East Maui Volcano, commonly known as Haleakala, on the
   island of Maui, is the only other Hawaiian volcano to have erupted
   since the late 1700's.

Origin of the Hawaiian Island Volcanic Chain

   An overview of "hot spots" and thermal plumes in the Earth's mantle is
   provided in this online USGS booklet about Plate Tectonics.

   Map of the southeastern or "windward" Hawaiian Islands. The islands owe
   their existence to a "hot spot" in the Earth's mantle that has changed
   location only slightly over the past 70 million years. This hot spot is
   located beneath the southeastern part of Hawai`i.

   Countless eruptions of lava fed by the hot spot built volcanoes that
   eventually grew above sea level to form islands. But the volcanoes
   didn't continue to erupt, because the seafloor on which they were built
   was continually moving northwestward across the hot spot at a rate of
   7-9 cm per year. Eventually each volcano was torn away from the hot
   spot and carried northwestward, just as a conveyor belt moves material
   from one location to another. Such is the fate for the active volcanoes
   on the Big Island, though they will be replaced by new volcanoes, of
   which Lo`ihi is the first born.

   Map of Hawaiian Island chain
   Map of the Hawaiian Islands, a chain of volcanoes that stretches about
   2,700 km in a northwesterly direction from the Island of Hawai`i. The
   age of the volcanoes that form the islands increases progressively from
   Hawai`i, where the volcanoes are still active, to the northwest end,
   where the volcanoes are about 30 million years old. The chain of
   volcanoes continues as seamounts for another 3,000 km; the chain bends
   sharply to the northward about 700 km beyond this map and becomes the
   Emperor Seamounts.
