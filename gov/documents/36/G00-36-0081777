                  Governor's Office of Planning & Research

                                   History

   The Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OPR) was created by
   statute in 1970 (Chapter 1534) as the comprehensive statewide planning
   agency and the research staff to the Governor. At the time of its
   creation, it combined the roles of two smaller agencies charged with
   intergovernmental relations (including the state clearinghouse
   function) and local government planning liaison. The statute added new
   functions of environmental policy coordination; research assistance for
   the Governor; and expanded local planning coordination, in response to
   the heightened interest in the 1970's in improved planning and the
   availability of federal funds for state and local strategic plans. OPR
   has also been assigned various other duties, summarized below, by
   statute and executive order.

   There is no statutory organization scheme for OPR. Rather, the
   organization is flexible and may be revised as necessary. During the
   2000-01 fiscal year, its positions and duties are grouped into the
   following units:


     * Executive
     * Administration
     * Legislative Analysis
     * Governor's Office Services
     * Planning and State Clearinghouse

     * General Research
     * Issues and Policy
     * Innovation in Government
     * Commission on Improving Life Through Service (California AmeriCorps
       Program)

   In addition, the Office of the Secretary for Education is within the
   OPR budgetary and administrative "umbrella" but is treated as a
   completely separate entity.
