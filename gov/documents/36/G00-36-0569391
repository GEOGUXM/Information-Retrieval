   The Moon is the Earth's only natural satellite. Though its mass is only
   1/81 that of the Earth, the Moon is an unusually large satellite in
   terms of relative size. As a planet,the Moon is a primitive body on
   which the very earliest stages of crustal evolution (more than 4
   billion years ago) are preserved. Its surface environment is clue to
   that of space itself.There is no atmosphere at all, and no global
   magnetic field, although there are local magnetic anomalies.The surface
   is like damp beach sand consisting of rock fragments produced by
   billions of years of meteoritic bombardment.The Moon is a fascinating
   body to study, and a potentially valuable site for astronomical
   observatories on its surface.

   No matter how the Moon formed, its creation must have had dramatic
   effects on Earth. Although most scientist have concluded that the Moon
   formed as a result of an enormous impact on Earth, we do not know much
   about the details of that event. We do not know if the Moon was made
   mostly from Earth materials or mostly projectile; the kinds of chemical
   reactions that would have taken place in the melt vapor cloud; and
   precisely how the Moon was assembled from this cloud.

   Paul D. Lowman, Jr. is a geologist with the Geodynamics Branch of the
   GSFC Laboratory for Terrestrial Physics, and has been with the Center
   since 1959. In a 40 year career, he has worked on the Mercury, Apollo,
   and Skylab programs. His research includes comparative planetology,
   global tectonics, and remote sensing. His current project is a book for
   Cambridge University Press, "Exploring Earth: the Impact of Space
   Flight on Geology and Geophysics."
