   Accessibility

      The NIH Consensus Development Program is making every effort to ensure
      that the information available on our website is accessible to all. If
      you use special adaptive equipment to access the Web and encounter
      problems when using our site, please let us know. Write to:
      bowersoj@od.nih.gov or call 301-496-4819 and we will provide the
      information to you in an alternate format. It would be helpful if you
      can be as specific as possible when describing the information you
      seek. For NIH employees who need assistance with accessibility issues,
      please contact the equal employment opportunity officer in your
      Institute.

      To learn more about the regulations governing the accessibility of
      Federal electronic information products, visit the Section 508 page.

      Thanks for using the NIH Consensus Program website.
