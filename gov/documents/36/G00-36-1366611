   The excitement of computer science is not only within the discipline
   itself. Advances in computers have led to leaps in almost every
   academic discipline and changed the very nature of our everyday lives.
   At the National Science Foundation, the Directorate for Computer and
   Information Sciences and Engineering promotes basic research and
   education in the computer and information sciences and engineering, and
   helps maintain the nation's preeminence in these fields. Such
   technologies affect nearly every facet of modern life from agriculture
   to manufacturing, health and education.
