                   Distributed Monitoring Framework (DMF)

   The goal of the Distributed Monitoring Framework is to improve
   end-to-end data throughput for data intensive applications in a
   high-speed WAN environments, and to provide the ability to do
   performance analysis and fault detection in a Grid computing
   environment. This monitoring framework will provide accurate, detailed,
   and adaptive monitoring of all of distributed computing components,
   including the network. Analysis tools will be able to use this
   monitoring data for real-time analysis, anomaly identification, and
   response.
   Many of the components of the DMF have already been prototyped or
   implemented by the DIDC Group.  The NetLogger Toolkit  includes
   application sensors, some system and network sensors, a powerful event
   visualization tool, and a simple event archive. The Network
   characterization Service has proven to be a very useful hop-by-hop
   network sensor. Our work on the Global Grid Forum Grid Monitoring
   Architecture (GMA) addressed the event management system. JAMM (Java
   Agents for Monitoring Management) is preliminary work on sensor
   management. The Enable project produced a simple network tuning advice
   service.
   The main components of the DMF are instrumentation, sensors, sensor
   management, event publication, and event archiving.
     * Instrumentation

     * The ability to do precision, real-time instrumentation of Grid
       applications and middleware is essential to the process of
       developing high performance data intensive applications. DMF will
       include tools to make it easy to non-intrusively add
       instrumentation to Grid middleware, and to publish this event data
       in a standard manner. Our previous work on the NetLogger Toolkit
       will provide the basis for this component.

     * Sensors

     * Network and host sensors, combined with instrumented applications,
       allow one to do end-to-end performance analysis. The DMF will
       define standard schemas and publication mechanisms for this sensor
       data. In particular, we will focus on network sensors. Based on our
       work on the Network Characterization Service, the DMF will include
       non-intrusive network sensors capable of hop-by-hop network
       analysis. There are plenty of existing host sensors available, and
       a subset of these will be integrated into the DMF. Other network
       monitoring work such as the Net100 project, and the Self
       Configuring Network Monitor project, whose goal is to design and
       deploy a passive monitoring infrastructure, will also be
       integrated.

     * Sensor Management System

     * As distributed systems become bigger and more complex, there are
       more pieces to monitor and manage. Some components will require
       constant monitoring, while others will only be monitored on demand.
       The sensors themselves need to be automatically installed, updated,
       and removed. We are developing a Sensor Management System, based on
       our JAMM work, to securely control the distribution and execution
       of monitoring sensors in a distributed/Grid environment.

     * Event Publication

     * To handle the potentially huge amounts of sensor event data
       requires a flexible, highly scalable event publication and
       subscription service. The Grid Monitoring Architecture (GMA) is
       designed for this purpose.

     * Event Archives

     * The ability to archive event data is critical for performance
       analysis and tuning, as well as for accounting purposes. The
       archive must be extremely high performance and scalable to ensure
       that it does not become a bottleneck. Our initial work in this area
       is called netarchd.
