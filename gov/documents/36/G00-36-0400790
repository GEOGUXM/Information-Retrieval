                  Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program
                                  (FLTCIP)

   The U.S. Office of Personnel Management is sponsoring a high-quality
   long term care insurance program for members of the Federal Family. We
   contracted with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and John Hancock
   Life Insurance Company, who have come together as LTC Partners to
   provide this insurance.

   The long term care insurance program is not available YET, but it will
   be soon. We will have an early enrollment opportunity from March 25
   through May 15 and an open season from July 1 through December 31,
   2002.

   YES we have dates for the early enrollment and open season! The early
   enrollment will run from March 25 - May 15. This enrollment is designed
   ONLY for those who've done their homework and already know about long
   term care and long term care insurance. For most people, early
   enrollment is not a good idea  they need the benefits of the extensive
   educational campaign that LTC Partners is preparing. For those people,
   the open season starting July 1 is the time to apply for enrollment in
   this new program. The open season runs from July 1 through December 31,
   2002. There will be staggered 60 day enrollment periods within the open
   season.

   Further information is available in our new Early Enrollment and Open
   Season Frequently Asked Questions. We will expand these FAQs as we
   refine our plans. We've always been open with what we're doing and how
   we're progressing, so we wanted to give you this limited information
   now, with details coming later.

   Did you know? . . .

   Did you know that 22 states allow either a deduction from your state
   taxes or a state tax credit for purchasing long term care insurance?
   Wonder why they allow these incentives? Because, for most people,
   buying long term care insurance is a GOOD thing to do! State tax
   deductions and credits help encourage people to buy the insurance. Take
   a look and see if your state is one of the 22.
