   Acid Rain and Our Nation's Capital
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/acidrain/

          This booklet focuses on acid rain and its impact on our Nation's
          capital. Rain in Washington, D.C., has an average acidity of
          4.2, about as acid as a carbonated drink and more than ten times
          as acid as clean, unpolluted rain. This booklet will define acid
          rain, explain what effects it has on marble and limestone
          buildings, and show, on a walking tour, some of the places in
          our Nation's capital where you can see the impact of acid
          precipitation.

   Birth of the Mountains: The Geologic Story of the Southern Appalachian
          Mountains
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/birth/

          The Southern Appalachian Mountain region is known worldwide for
          its great beauty and biological diversity. Why does this area
          have such beautiful scenery and such a diversity of plants and
          animals? How do the mountains, and the rocks and minerals of
          which they are made, affect the lives of people? How do people
          affect the mountains? To address these questions, we need to
          understand what took place millions of years ago and how these
          geologic events have influenced the landscape, climate, soils,
          and living things we see today.

   Building Stones of Our Nation's Capital
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/stones/

          The buildings of our Nation's Capital have been constructed with
          rocks from quarries throughout the United States and many
          distant lands. Each building shows important features of various
          stones and the geologic environment in which they were formed.
          This booklet describes the source and appearance of many of the
          stones used in building Washington, D.C. A map and a walking
          tour guide are included to help you discover Washington's
          building stones on your own.

   Deserts: Geology and Resources
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/

          Approximately one-third of the Earth's land surface is desert,
          arid land with meager rainfall that supports only sparse
          vegetation and a limited population of people and animals.
          Deserts--stark, sometimes mysterious worlds--have been portrayed
          as fascinating environments of adventure and exploration from
          narratives such as that of Lawrence of Arabia to movies such as
          "Dune."

          Few subjects in the Earth sciences are as fascinating to the
          public as dinosaurs. The study of dinosaurs stretches our
          imaginations, gives us new perspectives on time and space, and
          invites us to discover worlds very different from our modern
          Earth.

   Earthquakes
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/earthq1/

          One of the most frightening and destructive phenomena of nature
          is a severe earthquake and its terrible aftereffects. If the
          earthquake occurs in a populated area, it may cause many deaths
          and injuries and extensive property damage. Today we are
          challenging the assumption that earthquakes must present an
          uncontrollable and unpredictable hazard to life and property.
          Scientists have begun to estimate the locations and likelihoods
          of future damaging earthquakes. Sites of greatest hazard are
          being identified, and definite progress is being made in
          designing structures that will withstand the effects of
          earthquakes.

   Eruptions of Hawaiian Volcanoes: Past, Present, and Future
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/hawaii/

          Viewing an erupting volcano is a memorable experience, one that
          has inspired fear, superstition, worship, curiosity, and
          fascination throughout the history of mankind. In modern times,
          volcanic phenomena have attracted intense scientific interest,
          because they provide the key to understanding processes that
          have created and shaped more than 80 percent of the Earth's
          surface. The active Hawaiian volcanoes have received special
          attention worldwide because of their frequent spectacular
          eruptions, which can be viewed and studied with relative ease
          and safety.

   Eruptions of Mount St. Helens: Past, Present, and Future
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/publications/msh/

          May 18, 1980. On that fateful day, Mount St. Helens Volcano in
          Washington exploded violently after 2 months of intense
          earthquake activity and intermittent, relatively weak eruptions,
          causing the worst volcanic disaster in the recorded history of
          the United States. The cataclysmic eruption and related events
          on May 18 rank among the most significant geologic events in the
          United States during the 20th century.

          Fossils are the recognizable remains of past life on Earth and
          are fundamental to the geologic time scale. To tell the age of
          most layered rocks, scientists study the fossils these rocks
          contain. Fossils provide important evidence to help determine
          what happened in Earth history and when it happened.

   The Geologic History of Cape Cod, Massachusetts
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/capecod/

          Cape Cod, a sandy peninsula built mostly during the ice age,
          juts into the Atlantic Ocean like a crooked arm. Geologists are
          interested in Cape Cod because it was formed, by glaciers, very
          recently in terms of geologic time and because the shore is ever
          changing as the Cape adjusts to the rising sea.

   The Geologic Story of the Ocoee River
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/ocoee2/

          Over millions of years, the Ocoee River has cut a steep, winding
          channel into a mountainside of hard rock. As you travel through
          the Ocoee River Gorge along US Highway 64 in the scenic Cherokee
          National Forest of southeastern Tennessee, take some time to
          look at the rocks along the way.

   Geologic Time
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/

          The Earth is very old -- 4.5 billion years or more -- according
          to recent estimates. This vast span of time, called geologic
          time by earth scientists, is difficult to comprehend in the
          familiar time units of months and years, or even centuries. How
          then do scientists reckon geologic time, and why do they believe
          the Earth is so old? A great part of the secret of the Earth's
          age is locked up in its rocks, and our centuries-old search for
          the key led to the beginning and nourished the growth of
          geologic science.


   Cross-sectional drawing of the basement of a house showing how radon
   can enter a home

   The Geology of Radon
          http://energy.cr.usgs.gov/radon/georadon.html

          High levels of indoor radon are found in every state. We know
          from medical and environmental studies that radon can be a
          health risk, primarily as a cause of lung cancer. Radon comes
          from the soil, rock, and water around us. Because levels of
          radon vary from place to place, and because houses differ in
          their vulnerability to radon, it is important that all homes be
          measured for radon. These pages present important geological
          information about radon; how it forms, the kinds of rocks and
          soils it comes from, and how it moves through the ground or is
          carried by water into buildings, and explains the way geologists
          estimate the radon potential of an area.


   Photograph of a glacier

   Glaciers: Clues to Future Climate
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/glaciers/

          A glacier is a large mass of ice having its genesis on land and
          represents a multiyear surplus of snowfall over snowmelt. At the
          present time, perennial ice covers about 10 percent of the land
          areas of the Earth. Although glaciers are generally thought of
          as polar entities, they also are found in mountainous areas
          throughout the world, on all continents except Australia, and
          even at or near the Equator on high mountains in Africa and
          South America.

          Travelers on Interstate Highway 81 can see remnants of the Ice
          Age on the mountains between Strasburg and Harrisonburg,
          Virginia. Scattered along the miles of green, forested mountains
          are many gray patches without any forests. These treeless
          patches, or openings, in the steep mountain forests are block
          fields -- geologic features that owe their origin to the Ice
          Age.

   Gold
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/gold/

          Through the ages, men and women have cherished gold, and many
          have had a compelling desire to amass great quantities of it --
          so compelling a desire, in fact, that the frantic need to seek
          and hoard gold has been aptly named "gold fever." Gold was among
          the first metals to be mined because it commonly occurs in its
          native form -- that is, not combined with other elements --
          because it is beautiful and imperishable, and because exquisite
          objects can be made from it.

   The Great Ice Age
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/ice_age/

          The Great Ice Age, a recent chapter in the Earth's history, was
          a period of recurring widespread glaciations. Mountain glaciers
          formed on all continents, the icecaps of Antarctica and
          Greenland were more extensive and thicker than today, and vast
          glaciers, in places as much as several thousand feet thick,
          spread across North America and Eurasia.


   Cutaway diagram showing the interior of the Earth

   The Interior of the Earth
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/interior/

          Three centuries ago, Sir Isaac Newton determined that the
          average density of the Earth is twice that of surface rocks and
          that the Earth's interior therefore must be composed of much
          denser material. Our knowledge of what's inside the Earth has
          improved immensely since Newton's time, but his estimate of the
          density remains essentially unchanged. This brochure presents
          current information on what makes up the interior of our planet.

   Man Against Volcano: The Eruption on Heimaey, Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/heimaey/

          One of the most destructive volcanic eruptions in the history of
          Iceland began in the early morning of January 23,1973, near the
          country's premier fishing port, the town of Vestmannaeyjar, on
          Heimaey, the only inhabited isle in the Vestmannaeyjar volcanic
          archipelago. This booklet discusses the impact of the 1973
          volcanic eruption of Eldfell on the island of Heimaey. Before
          the eruption was over, approximately one-third of the town of
          Vestmannaeyjer had been obliterated, but, more importantly, the
          potential damage probably was reduced by the spraying of
          seawater onto the advancing lava f!ows, causing them to be
          slowed, stopped, or diverted from the undamaged portion of the
          town.

   Monitoring Active Volcanoes
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/monitor/

          Centuries ago, the Romans attributed volcanic and related
          phenomena (including earthquakes) mainly to the movement of wind
          imprisoned inside the Earth rushing violently to the surface.
          Today, scientists know that volcanic eruptions occur when
          buoyant magma (molten rock) that formed deep in the Earth
          ascends to the surface and ultimately is ejected upon release of
          gas pressure. With precise instruments and refined data
          analysis, it is now possible to track the subsurface movements
          of magma by monitoring the earthquakes and measuring the ground
          changes that accompany such movements.

   The Mountain That Moved
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/mountain/

          Prehistoric, giant landslides in Montgomery and Craig Counties,
          Va., in the Blacksburg/Wythe Ranger Districts of the Jefferson
          National Forest, are the largest known landslides in eastern
          North America and are among the largest in the world. One of the
          landslides is more than 3 miles long! The ancient, giant
          landslides extend for more than 20 miles along the eastern slope
          of Sinking Creek Mountain. Enormous slabs of rock ranging from
          about 0.2 to more than 1.5 square miles in size broke loose and
          slid downslope under the influence of gravity. The movement of
          some slides may have been slow, but the movement of others was
          probably sudden and catastrophic.

   Natural Gemstones
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/gemstones/

          A natural gemstone is a mineral, stone, or organic matter that
          can be cut and polished or otherwise treated for use as jewelry
          or other ornament. A precious gemstone has beauty, durability,
          and rarity, whereas a semiprecious gemstone has only one or two
          of these qualities. A gem is a gemstone that has been cut and
          polished.

          Continent 1 million years ago, compared to their present
          locations? Was North America always about the same size and
          shape that it is today? To answer these questions, geologists
          must interpret the clues they find preserved in the rocks.

          a series of "plates" that have been moving very slowly over the
          Earth's surface for millions of years. Two of these moving
          plates meet in western California; the boundary between them is
          the San Andreas fault.

          The video The Southern Appalachians: A Changing World describes
          the Southern Appalachian Mountains and how the geologic events
          that took place millions of years ago influenced the landscape,
          climate, soils, and living things that can be seen there today.
          Spanning a vast area from Virginia to Georgia, the Southern
          Appalachians are some of the oldest mountains on Earth. Molded
          and shaped over eons by volcanism, erosion, glaciation, and
          other geologic forces, these mountains are known worldwide for
          their unusual beauty and rich biological diversity. This
          teacher's guide summarizes the video and includes 17 suggested
          activities and discussion topics to enhance viewing.

   Silent Reminders
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/silent/

          The iron industry played a vital role in the industrialization
          of the United States and in the development of the U.S. economy
          and society. Much of the early history of the iron industry took
          place in Virginia. The remains of 11 iron furnaces and nearby
          mines in the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests in
          Virginia and West Virginia are silent reminders of a time when
          iron mines and furnaces operated along a belt that extended
          through the Appalachian Mountains from New York State to
          Alabama.

   The Severity of an Earthquake
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/earthq4/severitygip.html

          Earthquakes are the result of forces deep within the Earth's
          interior that continuously affect the surface of the Earth. The
          energy from these forces is stored in a variety of ways within
          the rocks. When this energy is released suddenly, for example by
          shearing movements along faults in the crust of the Earth, an
          earthquake results. The severity of an earthquake can be
          expressed in terms of both intensity and magnitude. However, the
          two terms are quite different, and they are often confused.

   Volcanic and Seismic Hazards on the Island of Hawaii
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/hazards/

          The eruptions of volcanoes often have direct, dramatic effects
          on the lives of people and on their property. People who live on
          or near active volcanoes can benefit greatly from clear,
          scientific information about the volcanic and seismic hazards of
          the area. This booklet provides such information for the
          residents of Hawaii so they may effectively deal with the
          special geologic hazards of the island.

          The United States ranks third, behind Indonesia and Japan, in
          the number of historically active volcanoes (that is, those for
          which we have written accounts of eruptions). In addition, about
          10 percent of the more than 1,500 volcanoes that have erupted in
          the past 10,000 years are located in the United States. Most of
          these volcanoes are found in the Aleutian Islands, the Alaska
          Peninsula, the Hawaiian Islands, and the Cascade Range of the
          Pacific Northwest; the remainder are widely distributed in the
          western part of the Nation. A few U.S. volcanoes have produced
          some of the largest and most dangerous types of eruptions in
          this century, while several others have threatened to erupt.

          The Earth is made of rock, from the tallest mountains to the
          floor of the deepest ocean. Thousands of different types of
          rocks and minerals have been found on Earth. By studying how
          rocks form and change, scientists have built a solid
          understanding of the Earth we live on and its long history.


   Plain Geology
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/plain.html

          More than 50 years ago former Director George Otis Smith
          recognized that scientific reports are often couched in words
          and phrases that are understandable only to other scientists,
          engineers, or technicians. His plea for "Plain Geology" was a
          classic, just as applicable now as it was in 1921. It is
          herewith reprinted to make it generally available.


   Prospecting for Gold in the United States
          http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/prospect2/prospectgip.html

          Anyone who pans for gold hopes to be rewarded by the glitter of
          colors in the fine material collected in the bottom of the pan.
          Although the exercise and outdoor activity experienced in
          prospecting are rewarding, there are few thrills comparable to
          finding gold. Even an assay report showing an appreciable
          content of gold in a sample obtained from a lode deposit is
          exciting. The would-be prospector hoping for financial gain,
          however, should carefully consider all the pertinent facts
          before deciding on a prospecting venture.
