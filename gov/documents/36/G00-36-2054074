     Traffic Advisory: Alternate Routes During NASA Road 1 Construction

    To improve traffic flow and reduce congestion along NASA Road 1, the
    City of Webster is encouraging motorists to use alternate routes for
      traveling during high traffic hours early in the morning and late
                                 afternoon.

    In order to ease congestion, city motorists are encouraged to use the
    I-45 northbound feeder road to Medical Center Boulevard to avoid the
     single lane construction zone. Medical Center Boulevard traffic can
    then re-access NASA Road 1 via Highway 3 or El Camino Real. Motorists
    traveling north on I-45 are encouraged to use Magnolia Street in lieu
          of NASA Road 1 for all eastbound NASA Road 1destinations.

    The final stages of widening NASA Road 1, from I-45 to Walnut Street,
   are temporarily reducing eastbound traffic to one lane east of the NASA
     Road 1 bridge that spans I-45. Webster Project Engineer Azher Uddin
   said the widening project remains on schedule for a May 2002 completion
                                    date.

     The City of Webster wishes to thank local residents, businesses and
    motorists for their patience during this important construction phase
                               of NASA Road 1.

 Expedition Four Commander Yury Onufrienko.

                Space Station Crew Returns to Regular Routine

   The Expedition Four crewmembers -- Commander Yury Onufrienko and Flight
   Engineers Carl Walz and Dan Bursch -- returned to a normal work routine
   Tuesday after spending a few days to wind down from last Friday's space
     walk. Among their regular activities is work with the International
                   Space Station's science investigations.

     During last week's space walk, Onufrienko and Bursch installed six
   thruster deflector shields at the rear of the Zvezda Service Module and
   three materials experiments, replaced a device to measure material from
      the thrusters, and installed a physics experiment and a ham radio
    antenna. Onufrienko and Walz performed Expedition Four's first space
                                walk Jan. 14.


 JSC Mentoring Program.

                   Apply Now for Center Mentoring Program

     JSC is now launching a mentoring program to foster the personal and
   professional growth of each of our employees. This program is designed
   to give you, the employee, the opportunity to serve as a mentor and/or
                     protégé to another JSC employee.

   Mentoring links a mentor with a protégé and helps facilitate personal
    and professional growth by sharing the knowledge and insights learned
   through the years. Mentoring is a strategy for comprehensive growth and
     development and in its truest form, a reciprocal relationship. Both
    members have a chance to learn, to gain a new perspective on the work
      environment, to stretch beyond comfortable boundaries and to meet
                       people from across the center.

     To apply now, visit the JSC Mentoring Program Web site and click on
      "Mentors" and/or "Proteges". The Mentoring Program is open to all
    permanent JSC civil servant and military employees in Houston and at
                         White Sands Test Facility.
