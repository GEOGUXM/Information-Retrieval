  NASA Home Page Survey

   Beginning Oct. 5, 2001, NASA will be offering a random selection of Web
   users the chance to fill out a survey about the NASA Home Page. Users
   will be asked to assess the Web site, its usefulness, graphic appeal
   and other features. They will also be asked about which NASA programs
   they are most interested in, and to describe which of NASA's many
   audiences includes them.

   Approximately 5 percent of NASA Web users will be asked if they would
   like to take the survey. Anyone who does not wish to take the survey
   can simply close the pop-up window when it appears.

   If you choose to take the survey, the software that creates the survey
   must place a session cookie on your computer. The cookie, a text file,
   allows the server to maintain connections with the user until the
   survey is completed. Please note that this cookie expires and is
   deleted from the user's computer the next time the user's browser is
   closed.

   Taking the survey does not require the user to give NASA or the survey
   firm any personal information.

   If you are offered the chance to fill out the survey, please take a few
   minutes to give us some direct feedback. We will use the data to better
   understand our audiences and what they want from the NASA Web.
