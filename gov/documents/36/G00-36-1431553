   U. S. Coast Guard National Response Center to take Reports of Terrorist
   Incidents The U. S. Coast Guard has announced that the National
   Response Center (NRC) will take reports from the maritime industry
   regarding suspected or actual terrorist incidents. The NRC is the
   central point of contact for all oil, chemical, radiological,
   biological and etiological releases anywhere in the United States.
   These hazardous substances may potentially be used in a terrorist
   incident, and given existing circumstances, the NRC can serve as an
   effective clearinghouse for notification of terrorism incidents. Upon
   notification of a potential terrorist incident, the NRC will connect
   the caller to the FBI's Strategic Intelligence and Operations Center
   (SIOC), who will coordinate with other agencies to perform an immediate
   assessment of the threat credibility. You may call the NRC, toll free,
   at: 1-800-424-8802.
