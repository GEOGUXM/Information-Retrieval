   M. J. Post, Chief
   MISSION:
   Our division develops and applies new microwave radar and radiometer
   technology to enhance our understanding of atmospheric and oceanic
   processes.

  Introduction

   Radar has been used for storm monitoring and research for almost half a
   century, but its full potential as a research and operational tool is
   far from being realized. Innovative techniques continue to expand the
   realm of atmospheric and oceanic phenomena that can be measured by
   radar. The Radar Meteorology and Oceanography Division's mission is to
   develop, exploit, and transfer microwave and millimeter-wave radar
   techniques; to combine radar with other remote sensors; to provide new
   understanding of the physics of the atmosphere and oceans; and to apply
   these new techniques to problems of national and global significance.
