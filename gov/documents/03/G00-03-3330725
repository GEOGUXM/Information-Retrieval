            MkIV Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) Interferometer
                   Atmospheric Chemistry Research Element

   The MkIV Interferometer is a Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR)
   Spectrometer, designed and built at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
   1984, to remotely sense the composition of the Earth's atmosphere by
   the technique of solar absorption spectrometry. This was born out of a
   concern that man-made pollutants (e.g. chlorofluorocarbons, aircraft
   exhaust) might perturb the ozone layer. Since 1984, the MkIV
   Interferometer has participated in 3 NASA DC-8 polar aircraft
   campaigns, and has successfully completed 11 balloon flights. In
   addition, the MkIV Interferometer made routine ground based
   measurements, during a two month campaign in 1986 from McMurdo,
   Antarctica.
