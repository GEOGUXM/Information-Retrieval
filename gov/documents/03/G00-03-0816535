     On July 18, 1997, it was announced that the Albany Division of the
   Federal Bureau of Investigation would be relocating to new space in the
                           south side of the city.

    This location supports the revitalization of the area and will bring
       the Albany Division into the twenty-first century with the best
                            resources available.
