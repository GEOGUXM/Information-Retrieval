     * CUBIT Mesh Generation/Grid Generation Program:
       The CUBIT mesh generation/grid generation environment is a two- and
       three-dimensional finite element mesh generation tool which is
       being developed to pursue the goal of robust and unattended mesh
       generation---effectively automating the generation of quadrilateral
       and hexahedral elements. It is a solid-modeler based preprocessor
       that meshes volume and surface solid models for finite element
       analysis. A combination of techniques including paving, mapping,
       sweeping, and various other algorithms being developed are
       available for discretizing the geometry into a finite element mesh.
     * SEACAS: The Sandia Engineering Analysis Code Access System.
       The Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) Engineering Analysis Code
       Access System (SEACAS) is a collection of structural and thermal
       finite element analysis codes and utilities used by analysts at
       SNL. The system includes pre- and post-processing codes, analysis
       codes, database translation codes, support libraries, UNIX shell
       scripts, and an installation system.
     * DAKOTA: Large-scale Engineering Optimization and Uncertainty
       Analysis Toolkit.
       The DAKOTA (Design Analysis Kit for Optimization and Terascale
       Applications) toolkit provides a flexible, extensible interface
       between analysis codes and iteration methods. DAKOTA contains
       algorithms for optimization with gradient and nongradient-based
       methods; uncertainty quantification with sampling, analytic
       reliability, and stochastic finite element methods; parameter
       estimation with nonlinear least squares methods; and
       sensitivity/primary effects analysis with design of experiments and
       parameter study capabilities. These capabilities may be used on
       their own or as components within advanced strategies for
       surrogate-based optimization, mixed integer nonlinear programming,
       or optimization under uncertainty.
     * Structural Dynamics and Vibration Control (9234):
       The structural dynamics and controls department provides services
       in all aspects of dynamic modeling and control. A variety of
       applications combining finite element analysis with a number of
       related disciplines are represented.
