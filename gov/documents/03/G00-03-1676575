   FMCSA Fatigue Study (look for Effects of Sleep Schedules on Commercial
   Motor Vehicle Driver Performance on the FMCSA home page)
   This study had two parts.
       The first was a field study that had the objective of obtaining an
       accurate measurement of the amount and timing of sleep that local
       and over-the-road drivers obtain. The second part, a laboratory
       study, had the objective of determining relationships between
       partial sleep deprivation and performance (cognitive,
       physiological, subjective assessment). Subjects had a 3-day
       training period in the lab (with 9 hours time-in-bed) , then
       received either 3, 5, 7, or 9 hours time-in-bed over a 7-day period
       (15-16 ss per group), followed by a 4-day in-lab recovery period.
       As we expected, there were differences in many outcome measures
       between and among the groups -- but there were more severe
       decrements in performance than we anticipated between the 9-hour
       and the 7-hour groups.
