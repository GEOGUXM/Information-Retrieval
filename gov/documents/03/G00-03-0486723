                                                           NIST Logo

   The Visualization and Virtual Reality for Manufacturing project is a
   SIMA (Systems Integration for Manufacturing Automation) funded project
   that examines the role of advanced user interfaces for manufacturing
   applications.

   The objective of the VVRM project is to explore the feasibility of a
   range of tools and techniques that support advanced manufacturing.

   For a full listing of our prototypes, papers or to obtain our software,
   please see our Open Virtual Reality Testbed page. We have a varity of
   prototype software including:
     * Java based Virtual Environment Device Interfaces (JVEDI) -
       integrates VRML worlds with serial port devices.
     * Web3D Translators - several translators to and from VRML and X3D.
     * Chisel & Vorlon source code (mirror site) and WebChisel (applet
       executable) - source code to Chisel and Vorlon donated by
       Trapezium, and WebChisel a method to execute Chisel remotely
       without requiring full installation.
     * AnthroSources - a collection of resources for anthropometric
       professionals and standards developers.
     * VRML and Accessiblity - some tools to aid improving the
       accessibility of VRML and work with a disabilities foundation.
     * VRML Examples - sample VRML worlds produced by the project.
     * Multi-user Collaborative Worlds - sample multi-user collaborative
       worlds (NIST INTERNAL ONLY), must be in the NIST firewall.
     * Press Coverage - press coverage over the years.
     * Publications - papers and presentations we've done over the years.

   The VVRM project is a product of the Visualization and Usability Group,
   Information Access Division, Information Technology Laboratory of the
   National Institute of Standards and Technology.
