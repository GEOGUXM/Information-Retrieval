   Wyoming's Chip on my Shoulder

   [jan-2002.jpg] I first heard about the BLM Adoption program in 1980. I
   was just out of college then and striking out on my own. I requested,
   and still have, some pamphlets issued by the BLM from 1980, on adopting
   a wild horse or burro. But these things got filed away where things get
   filed as a young adult learns to manage a new job, a new house, and all
   the responsibilities that surround being out on one's own.

   Internet Sulphur Horse Goes to New Mexico

   [nov-2001.jpg] My name is Dale Willis, I am a teacher on the Navajo
   Reservation in New Mexico. I recently fulfilled a lifelong dream of
   adopting a mustang. The person in the picture is Adrain Wauneka, my
   fourteen year old apprentice and my right arm. I intended to adopt two
   horses, one for myself and one for Adrain, but I only have one so far.
   That one was Adrain's birthday gift.

   Elk Hunting with Mustangs

   [oct2-2001.jpg] Knowing nothing about the wild horse program I stumbled
   on to your web site after a friend mentioned the program. I was
   originally looking for two pack horses for an elk hunting trip in a
   couple of years in the future. In June I bid on two from the Riverton
   Honor Farm and got them both, however I was unable to pick them up
   until July 5th.
