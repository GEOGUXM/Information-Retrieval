       The Health Care Financing Administration is now the Centers for
     Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). It's more than just a new name,
   it's an increased emphasis on responsiveness to the people we serve. As
    a part of this effort, we have also launched a new website. Read here
                              for more details.

     CMS provides health insurance for over 74 million Americans through
   Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP. The majority of these individuals receive
   their benefits through the fee-for-service delivery system, however, an
             increasing number are choosing managed care plans.

    In addition to providing health insurance, CMS also performs a number
      of quality-focused activities, including regulation of laboratory
    testing (CLIA), development of coverage policies, and quality-of-care
   improvement. CMS maintains oversight of the survey and certification of
     nursing homes and continuing care providers (including home health
    agencies, intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded, and
        hospitals), and makes available to beneficiaries, providers,
   researchers and State surveyors information about these activities and
                            nursing home quality.

    To ensure public and expert involvement in running our programs, CMS
   maintains a number of chartered advisory committees. These committees,
    whose meetings are open to the public, are used to provide advice or
        make recommendations on a variety of issues relating to CMS's
                      responsibilities and activities.
