   GFDL-NOMADS Services:

      Public data sets at the GFDL are made available through the NOAA
      Operational Model Archive and Distribution System (NOMADS). NOMADS is
      designed to provide access to: download, display of data attributes,
      and graphical display the data. Download provides "http" access to
      download complete files. Display of data attributes provides
      information on the global attributes and the variables available in the
      files. Graphical display uses the Live Access Server to graphically
      display the data on the client.

   GFDL-NOMADS Registration:

      Registration for the GFDL-NOMADS is free. Users are requested to
      complete the attached
      GFDL-NOMADS Registration Form when they first begin using NOMADS.
      Information from this form will be used to provide registrated users
      with news on when additional public data becomes available and when
      corrections are made to existing public data. The information gathered
      will not be used for any purposes other than to send notices about
      GFDL-NOMADS Services.

   GFDL-NOMADS Data:

        * DecCen Coupled Climate Experiments: multi-century global coupled
          climate model experiments run both with time varying radiative
          forcings (greenhouse scenario experiments) and control experiments.
        * Ocean Assimilation Experiments:
          experiments from a model used for seasonal to interannual
          prediction and studies of the time period 1981-2000.

   GFDL-NOMADS User Services:

      Technical questions concerning the GFDL-NOMADS should be sent to:
      nomads_services@gfdl.noaa.gov

   GFDL-NOMADS Data Storage:

      The data files on NOMADS are stored in netCDF (network Common Data
      Form), and can be identified by the suffix ".nc". The files are
      intended to be compliant with the COARDS conventions for the
      standardization of netCDF files. More information about netCDF, a
      machine independent format for representing array-oriented scientific
      data, can be found at the Unidata Program Center netCDF website.

   GFDL-NOMADS Software:

      The GFDL-NOMADS implements both the Distributed Oceanographic Data
      System (DODS) package from Unidata/UCAR and the Live Access Server
      (LAS) package from PMEL/NOAA. Users of LAS are required to have
      installed the FERRET data visualization and analysis program developed
      at PMEL/NOAA.

   GFDL-NOMADS System Administration:

      The following are available for internal usage only: System
      Documentation, Usage Statistics and List Registered Users.
