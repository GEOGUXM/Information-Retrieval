                            ADWR AND OUR MISSION

   The Arizona Department of Water Resources works to secure long-term
   dependable water supplies for Arizona's communities. The Department:
     * administers and enforces Arizonas groundwater code, and surface
       water rights laws (except those related to water quality);
     * negotiates with external political entities to protect Arizona's
       Colorado River water supply;
     * oversees the use of surface and groundwater resources under state
       jurisdiction, and
     * represents Arizona in discussions of water rights with the federal
       government.

   In addition, the Department explores methods of augmenting water
   supplies to meet future demands, and develops policies that promote
   conservation and equitable distribution of water.

   The Department also inspects dams and participates in flood control
   planning to prevent property damage, personal injury, and loss of life.

   In support of these activities, ADWR collects and analyzes data on
   water levels and on water-quality characteristics.

   Other responsibilities include management of floodplains and
   non-federal dams to reduce loss of life and damage to property. ADWR is
   not a municipal water provider.
