   Basic Energy Sciences Synchrotron Radiation Center

   The Basic Energy Sciences Synchrotron Radiation Center (BESSRC) at the
   Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory is formed of
   scientists from the Chemistry, Materials Science, Geosciences and
   Physics Divisions at ANL and researchers from Northern Illinois
   University. Research activities at this CAT will also be carried out by
   internal and outside users. The internal program will be in support of
   ongoing BES programs within the Physical Research Divisions and
   collaborating Institutions.

   The BESSRC Collaborative Access Team (CAT) will develop and instrument
   two sectors (Sectors 11 and 12) that will serve the research needs of
   users with particular interests in Materials Science, Chemical Science,
   Atomic Physics and Geosciences.
