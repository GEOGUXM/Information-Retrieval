Mission Statement - what we do:

     Our mission is to provide useful and reliable computing environments
     for the Fermilab community.

     We do this through a variety of activities. Some of those are listed
     below.  Detailed discussions
     of the services provided and philosophies of operation can be found
     in the sections below.

     * Provide Unix and Windows servers for general and dedicated use.
     * Provide Unix desktop computing support for scientific and
       engineering workstations.
     * Provide Windows desktop computing support for general office
       applications.
     * Provide Unix general purpose applications.
     * Provide vendor liaison and administrator consulting on supported
       operating systems.

General Philosophy and Guidelines

     Computing systems that OSS supports span the range from multi-CPU
     servers in the data center to individual desktops. Appropriate uses
     and management techniques of these systems vary as well. We
     conceptually break systems into four classes of machines ( high
     availability servers, servers, test stands, and desktops). The
     definitions of these service classes and support levels can be found
     in DR00016. A list of Unix services we recommend be turned off can
     be found at http://www-oss.fnal.gov/policy/services.html. Current
     department security requirements are listed at
     http://www-oss.fnal.gov/policy/security_req.html. OSS follows a
     template for designing systems, that can be found here-
     http://www-oss.fnal.gov/policy/design_doc.html.

     OSS maintains a series of communications paths to help support
     systems and respond to problems. The emergency communications path
     is always through phone to Customer Support at x2345 (or through off
     hours number given there). Only problems reported this way, or
     through mail to helpdesk@fnal.gov, are tracked and subject to
     escalation procedures. OSS escalation protocol is described here
     (not yet online). Notification of system changes, service level
     changes, etc. is currently given by mailing lists and newsgroups.
     This is currently under review.

     Finally, there are a series of "standards bodies" to which OSS
     belongs and where agreements on standard configurations and
     procedures are made. These bodies determine labwide, CD-wide, and
     data center-wide standards to which we participate and conform.

Organization

     As of September 5, 2000 the Department reorganized into three groups
     ( CSI - Core Services and Infrastructure, SCS - Scientific Computing
     Support, and TOC - Technical and Office Computing). The names of the
     group should give a hint to the organizational principles for the
     groupings of responsibilities. Technical and Office Computing is
     responsible for OSS assignments in support of Division/Section
     operational needs. Scientific Computing Support is responsible for
     supporting OSS assignments predominantly for scientific analysis.
     Core Services and Infrastructure is responsible for OSS assignments
     with sitewide (or larger) scope. If you drill down to the pages for
     each group, you can find details on the assignments of each group.
       _______________________________________________________________

Responsibilities

     * Core Services and Infrastructure: generally, provide support for
       labwide services such as email, print and AFS. For help on these
       systems, contact helpdesk@fnal.gov

     * DR0010: Certified Operating Systems.
     * Linux Support at Fermilab.
     * Windows 2000 Support at Fermilab.
     * Applications and Documentation: some level of support for a variety
       of [mostly UNIX] utilities and tools. Please see the Computing
       Division Documentation and Software pages for information on
       specific packages, applications, etc.
     * Systems support for the major laboratory core services including
        Web servers, AFS servers, SMTP Gateway, IMAP servers, POP
            server,news servers, license servers, installation servers
            (linux and SGI), software distribution servers (Unix and
            Windows), print servers, console servers.

     Scientific Computing Support: generally, systems (other than CDF and
   D0) which are dedicated to scientific computing applications. For help
   on these systems, contact helpdesk@fnal.gov
     * FNALU
     * Farms
     * SDSS
     * KTeV
     * CMS
     * Fixed Target
     * MINOS
     * PPD-EPP
     * PPD-SiDet
     * PPD Astro
     * PPD Theory

   Note, SCS supports the physical machines, but the Integrated Systems
   Development Department supports batch services on fnalu and the farms.

     Technical and Office Computing Systems: generally, systems which are
   dedicated to technical and office computing applications. For help on
   these systems, contact helpdesk@fnal.gov
     * OLS cluster
     * CAD systems
     * CAD Tools Committee (members only)
     * PPD CAD systems
     * ADCS CAD systems
     * ADMS CAD systems

Linux Support:

     * Linux at Fermilab: the specifics of Linux installation and
       configuration at Fermilab.
     * A snapshot of UAS Products released under ups v4, all of which
       include Linux releases.
     * Policy Statements:
          + The Computing Division Linux Support Policy statement.
          + The Computing Division Newsletter for January 1998 is
            dedicated to a discussion of the policies and priorities of
            Linux support at Fermilab.
          + Linux Application Support: which products will be made
            available for Linux, and when.
     __________________________________________________________________

Windows 2000 Support:

     * Windows 2000 at Fermilab: Takes you to the Windows 2000 Migration
       home page
     * The Windows 2000 Migration working group is made up of lab
       representatives from each major Division/section. Specific
       questions regarding the lab's migration to Windows 2000 can be
       addressed to w2kmig@fnal.gov. General questions regarding Windows
       2000 can be sent to w2k-users@fnal.gov.
