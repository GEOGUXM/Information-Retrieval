   Background

      The FAA in Alaska has been given the opportunity to deploy cameras at
      remote sites around Alaska.  These cameras provide weather images to
      pilots via the internet and are updated as often as every ten minutes.
      The cameras are aimed to give the best indication of weather in the
      direction most relevant to VFR traffic.

   Our Mission

      The mission of Alaska Weather Cams is to provide recent images from
      locations where weather observation does not exist.  These images will
      be updated as often as possible, given the limitations of the
      infrastructure at the given sites.

   Profile

      The FAA takes pride in providing the safest environment for air travel
      available in the world through the implementation of state of the art
      technology.
