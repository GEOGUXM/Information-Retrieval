     * Column-integrated ozone (LaRC Model)
       This loop shows the annual evolution of total ozone in the southern
       hemisphere. The development and subsequent recovery of ozone during
       springtime in the Antarctic region (the "Antarctic ozone hole") is
       clearly evident and is in reasonable accord with satellite
       observations.

     * Monthly mean Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) (LaRC Model/ERBE)
       The following loops depict the monthly mean distribution of
       Outgoing Longwave Radiation from an explicit troposphere version of
       the LaRC 3-D Model which is under development and the Earth
       Radiation Budget (ERBE). The distributions are being used to guide
       our development of cloud/radiative parameterizations in the LaRC
       3-D Model.

          + ERBE OLR
     * Monthly mean Percent Cloudiness (LaRC Model/ISCCP)
       The following loops depict the monthly mean distribution of Percent
       Cloudiness from an explicit troposphere version of the LaRC 3-D
       Model which is under development and the International Satellite
       Cloud Climatology Program (ISCCP). The distributions are being used
       to guide our development of moisture transport and cloud
       parameterizations in the LaRC 3-D Model.

          + LaRC 3-D Model Monthly Mean High Cloud Loop
          + LaRC 3-D Model Monthly Mean Midlevel Cloud Loop
          + LaRC 3-D Model Monthly Mean Lowlevel Cloud Loop
          + ISCCP Monthly Mean Total Cloud Loop
          + ISCCP Monthly Mean High Cloud Loop
          + ISCCP Monthly Mean Midlevel Cloud Loop
          + ISCCP Monthly Mean Lowlevel Cloud Loop
     * Sudden Stratospheric Warming (LaRC Model)
       The following loops depict daily synoptic distributions of Northern
       Hemisphere 10mb Geopotential Height and Zonal Mean Winds during a
       simulated sudden stratospheric warming which occurred during the
       LaRC 3-D Model Simulation.
