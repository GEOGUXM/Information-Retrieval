   Environmental Community Relations

   Environmental Community Relations is a part of the LLNL Environmental
   Protection Department. Its mission is to provide information about LLNL
   environmental activities to the community. We try to be as
   non-technical as possible but still accurate and representative of a
   scientific institution. We want to communicate with you and help you
   understand issues you think are important. picture of Bert Heffner

   On this web site you will find our latest publications, letters,
   announcements of public meetings. You will also find a direct link to
   my e-mail location so I can respond as quickly as possible to your
   questions.
   Your comments on how we can improve this public information are always
   appreciated.

   Bert Heffner
   Manager, Environmental Community Relations

   P.S. For any questions please e-mail me or if you prefer, please call

  EIS/EIR (Environmental Impact Statement and Environmental Impact Report)

   green bullet 1992 DOE EIS/EIR (web site)
   Please note that this on-line version scanned by HQ DOE from an
   original paper version has been found to contain scanning errors in the
   units such as micrograms, where the symbol is read by the scanner as
   milligrams, thus giving a 1000-fold error in the number value. These
   errors appear mostly in sections dealing with air concentrations of
   emmisions and beryllium, etc, not in Noise sections, etc. This error
   has been brought to the attention of HQ DOE, but remains unfixed.
