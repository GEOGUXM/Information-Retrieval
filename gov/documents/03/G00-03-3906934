   Mission:
   Cockpit   The Human Factors Research and Technology Division advances
   human-centered design and operations of complex aerospace systems
   through analysis, experimentation and modeling of human performance and
   human-automation interaction to make dramatic improvements in safety,
   efficiency and mission success.

   Strategic Goals:

   Perception   To advance our fundamental understanding of how people
   process information, make decisions and collaborate with human and
   machine systems.
   Haploscope   To enhance aviation safety and performance by designing
   human-centered automation and interfaces, decision support tools,
   training, and team and organizational practices.
   Tracker   To extend human capabilities in space by advancing our
   knowledge of human performance during space missions and developing
   tools, technologies and countermeasures for safe and effective space
   operations.
