  Mission Responsibilities

   The Panama City Laboratory, located in Panama City Florida, is operated
   by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center of the National Marine
   Fisheries Service. The agency's mission is to manage the nation's
   living marine resources. The laboratory performs biological research
   relevant to the formulation of rational plans to manage the marine
   fishery resources of the U.S. south Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.
   The current research program encompasses a spectrum of research
   projects ranging from basic research on fishery ecology and
   oceanography to routine monitoring and data collection. The fisheries
   of primary interest are for reef fish and coastal pelagic species.

   Current Projects:
   * Marine Protected Areas.
   * Age and growth of reef fishes.
   * Reef fish reproduction (snappers and groupers).
   * Recruitment of reef fishes to offshore waters.
   * Reef fish recruitment dynamics and habitat utilization and
   suitability in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico.
   * Grouper spawning aggregations and evaluation of the experimental
   Oculina Research Reserve.
   * Migration, growth, population genetics and juvenile ecology of
   goliath grouper.
   * Reproductive biology, demographics, and population dynamics of red
   porgy.
   * Essential Fish Habitat Matrices.
   * Age, growth, and life history of sharks.
   * Juvenile shark abundance, distribution, and pupping areas.
   * Shark drift gill net observer program.
   * Shark population dynamics and stock assessment.
   * Age and growth of pelagic fishes.
   * Determining stock composition of king mackerel catches using otolith
   shape analysis.
   * Bioprofile sampling for species, sex, and age composition of catches.
   * Comparative life history of paralichthid flounders.
   * Application of remote sensing/geographic information systems(GIS) to
   conservation of marine resources.
   * Billfish tournament sampling surveys.
   * Fishery landings data collection.
   * Marine mammal stranding network.
   * Bottlenose dolphin studies.
   * Nonindigenous species impacts in the Gulf of Mexico.
   * Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) testing and by-catch reduction
   development performed by staff of the Galveston and Pascagoula
   laboratories.

  History

   The Panama City Laboratory was originally established as the Eastern
   Gulf Marine Laboratory of the U.S. Bureau of Sportfisheries and
   Wildlife, U.S. Dept. of Interior in 1966. It was housed in rental
   buildings near the St. Andrews Marina in Panama City. The agency was
   reorganized into the National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA, U.S.
   Dept. of Commerce in 1970. Also in 1970, construction began on the new
   laboratory, on land donated by the Panama City Chamber of Commerce. The
   new building was occupied in May 1972. The laboratory directors have
   been: Norman G. Vick (1966-1970); Eugene L. Nakamura (1970-1993); Dr.
   Churchill Grimes (1993-1998); Dr. Herb Kumpf (1998-). Former research
   programs included benthic studies of invertebrate populations,
   artifical reef research, fishing gear selectivity, sea turtle
   conservation, as well as age and growth, food habits, reproduction and
   migration of fishes.

  Facilities

   [A photo of the Laboratory building]
   The Laboratory is located on 11.6 acres of land on St. Andrew Bay. The
   major facilities consist of a main building (13,380 sq.ft.), holding 14
   offices/labs,
   a library, wet lab, storage areas and conference room; a boat basin
   with two docks and a boat ramp, boat house (2320 sq.ft.), fuel storage
   and pumping facility, and gear storage building (4800 sq.ft.). Also
   located on the property are a weather tower communication structure and
   an office of the National Marine Fisheries Service Habitat Conservation
   Division.

  Equipment

   The Panama City Laboratory is a fully-equipped modern science facility.
   The scientists use the state of the art equipment in both laboratory
   and field. In addition to the typical analytical tools, such as
   microscopes and balances, our researchers use advanced equipment such
   as optical pattern recognition systems for age and growth, geographic
   information systems for analysis of satellite imagery and other spatial
   data, and biochemical techniques for stock identification. The lab has
   a walk-in refrigerator and freezer, as well as chemical supplies for
   the preservation of specimens. Additionally, computers and relevant
   software figure very highly in lab operations. We also utilize floating
   cages and a temperature controlled recirculating seawater system for
   holding live specimens and conducting experiments.
   The laboratory's research fleet consists of five boats for sampling
   purposes, ranging in size from 13 to 25'. Sampling gear includes
   handlines, longlines, gill nets, seine nets, plankton collecting nets,
   trawls, various traps and tagging equipment. Laboratory researchers
   have access to the NOAA oceanographic research vessels Oregon II and
   Chapman, berthed in Pascagoula, Mississippi, for at-sea sampling.

  Cooperative Programs

   The Panama City Laboratory does cooperative research with scientists
   from other agencies and universities. It participates in cooperative
   programs with the University of Florida, Florida State University,
   Lousiana State University, Savannah State College, Ga., Florida A&M
   University and Gulf Coast Community College in Panama City as well as
   the Environmental Protection Agency's Gulf of Mexico Program,
   Department of Interior's U.S.Geological Survey, and the State of
   Florida. It has a Bay County Partnership agreement with Surfside Middle
   School. It participates in the Bay Environmental Study Team, a local
   multi-agency consortium. In 1995, the
   Institute for Fishery Resource Ecology (IFRE) was formed between
   Florida State University and the Panama City Laboratory. This Institute
   provides for the sharing of resources and personnel for cooperative
   research, teaching, and graduate studies.
   Laboratory staff participate in numerous outreach activities throughout
   the year, including the Bay County and Three Rivers Science Fairs,
   Middle School career day fairs, lab tours and other programs.
