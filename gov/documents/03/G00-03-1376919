    As innovative as our forefathers and as dynamic as the world in which
     we live. We at DAPS strive to use computing technologies in new and
                          ever challanging ways...

   The Deployable Adaptive Processing Systems (DAPS) project is a
   multi-faceted R&D program within DOE, currently developing algorithms
   and prototyping demonstration systems for real-time remote and
   autonomous processing of data gathered on land, in the air, or in
   space. Synthesis of multiple sensor channels into one coherent
   measurement, requirements for independent operation without human
   interaction, and and the necessity of sending critical information
   through telemetry channels with constrained data capacity, drive the
   project mission to find new solutions for real-time pattern
   recognition, detection, compression, and feature extraction, operating
   on a variety of time series and video signals.
