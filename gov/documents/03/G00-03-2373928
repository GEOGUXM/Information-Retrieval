   The six-member Integrated Waste Management Board is responsible for
   protecting the public's health and safety and the environment through
   management of the estimated 60 million tons of solid waste generated in
   California. The Board works in partnership with local government,
   industry, and the public to reduce waste disposal and ensure
   environmentally safe landfills. California reuses and recycles
   approximately 42 percent of its solid waste. The Board is one of six
   agencies under the umbrella of the California Environmental Protection
   Agency.
