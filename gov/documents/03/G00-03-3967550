   The Natural Resources Conservation Service provides leadership for the
   conservation of natural resources on private lands. Using our
   scientific and technical expertise, along with our partnerships with
   soil and water conservation districts and others, we help people
   conserve all natural resources on private lands.

   Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, and
   Wisconsin comprise the Region. The landscape, natural resources, and
   human population of the Region are as diverse as any in the United
   States. The Midwest states are called the "Cornerstone of American
   Agriculture".
