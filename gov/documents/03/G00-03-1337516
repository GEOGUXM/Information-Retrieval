  The following maps are updated daily

The meteograms are now being generated from forecasts created on the IBM-SP
system. Because of the massive-parallel nature of the machine, hourly point
diagnostics are not routinely produced. The meteograms are now derived from
3-hourly AVN output and 12-hourly MRF output.
