   K amLAND (Kamioka Liquid scintillator Anti-Neutrino Detector) is a
   large neutrino detector currently being built on the island of Honshu
   in Japan. KamLAND is a primarily Japanese funded experiment and
   consists of a large international collaboration including Japan and the
   US. It will be the largest low-energy antineutrino detector ever built.
   It will hopefully answer many key questions concerning neutrino
   oscillation by studying the flux and energy spectra produced by
   neutrinos from local Japanese commercial reactors. With such good
   location (most of the Japanese reactors are located within 150-200
   kilometers away), the KamLAND site is expected to be exposed to a large
   flux of low-energy anti-neutrinos. There is an expected rate of 700
   anti-neutrinos detected every year, an enormous improvement over
   previous attempts from any other detector. In addition to observing
   anti-neutrinos from reactors, KamLAND is hoping to shed some light on
   the "solar neutrino puzzle" by directly observing the beryllium-7 and
   boron-8 solar neutrinos. One of the largest difficulties in observing
   solar neutrinos is reducing the detector's background radiation. There
   is a layer of mineral oil surrounding the active scintillator volume
   (shielding any external gamma and neutron radiation) and several other
   precautions have been taken to minimize any background radiation.
   KamLAND is hoping to be functional in the beginning of 2001.
