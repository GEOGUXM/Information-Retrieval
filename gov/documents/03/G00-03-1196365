                       The Portland VA Medical Center

   (PVAMC) is a 303-bed consolidated facility with two main divisions. The
     medical center serves as the quaternary referral center for Oregon,
     Southern Washington, and parts of Idaho. for the U.S. Department of
     Veterans Affairs. The Portland VAMC is located atop Marquam Hill on
   28.5 acres overlooking the city of Portland. The medical centers major
   academic affiliate, the Oregon Health Sciences University, is connected
                   by a 660-foot skybridge to the VA.

   The Vancouver Division, the medical centers second campus, is located
   11 miles north of the Portland Division in Vancouver, Washington. The
   former Vancouver VA Hospital was integrated in 1980 with the Portland
   VA Medical Center.

   The medical center has established four community-based outpatient
   clinics (CBOCs), located in Bend, Salem and Camp Rilea in Oregon, and
   in Longview, Washington.

   The Portland VAMC supports two Veterans Outreach Centers; one located
   in north-east Portland in a small commercial storefront setting and the
   other located in a downtown Salem business complex located 60 miles
   south of the Portland Division.

   More than 1200 administrative and clinical trainees receive some of
   their training at this Medical Center each year. There are 124 funded
   house officers in 25 different specialties. Other training programs
   include chaplaincy, psychology, nuclear medicine, nursing, pharmacy,
   engineering, occupational and physical therapy, dietetics, social work,
