    NEAT is comprised of two autonomous observing systems at Maui Space
    Surveillance Site, NEAT/MSSS, and at Palomar Observatory, NEAT/Palomar. At
    both sites the NEAT cameras use 1.2-m (48") telescopes to find Near-Earth
    objects (NEOs), both Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and comets. We discovered 6
    NEAs in December-- 4 Apollos including 3 PHAs and 2 Amors including 1 > 1
    km.

   The NEA 2001 YB[5] discovered with NEAT on 26 December 2001 sped within
   ~2 lunar distances of the Earth on 7 January 2002. Two movies of this
   object taken at other observatories were kindly provided,
   2001YB[5]-movie1 ( by Daniel Scarpa & Antonio MÃ¡s, Observatorio Kappa
   Crucis MPC 913, Montevideo, Uruguay) and 2001YB[5]-movie2 (by John E.
   Rogers, Camarillo Observatory, Camarillo, CA).

                        LATE BREAKING IMAGES [new4.jpg]

Thus far in January we discovered 8 NEAs with NEAT: 4 Amors including 1>1km, and
4 Apollos including 2 PHAs, and 1 1 km.

   eccentric orbit that crosses Mars, Earth, Venus, and Mercury

   *Amors, Apollos, and Atens are the three categories of Near-Earth
   asteroids (NEAs). Amor asteroids approach the Earth's orbit from the
   outside, Apollo asteroids cross the Earth's orbit, and Aten asteroids
   approach the Earth's orbit from the inside. Potentially Hazardous
   asteroids (PHAs) are larger than ~200 m (0.1 mile) and approach close
   enough to present a potential hazard but not a current hazard.
