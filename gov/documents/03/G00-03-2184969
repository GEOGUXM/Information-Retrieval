   Welcome to the WWW Home Page for the Metrology for Simulation and
   Computer Aided Design Project! The project is part of the Device
   Technology Group within the Semiconductor Electronics Division at NIST.
   A variety of other WWW resources are available at NIST through the NIST
   WWW Home Page. The present page, however, will direct you to
   information about the activities within the Metrology for Simulation
   and Computer Aided Design Project.

   The currently available information topics are:
     * Description of Simulation and Computer Aided Design Project
     * Current Activities Within Project
     * NIST Working Group on Model Validation [updated.gif]
     * Software Programs Available from this Project [new.gif]
