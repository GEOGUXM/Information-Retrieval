   The HEASARC is a source of gamma-ray, X-ray, and extreme ultraviolet
   observations of cosmic (non-solar) sources. This site provides access
   to archival data, associated analysis software, data format standards,
   documentation, expertise in how to use them, as well as relevant
   educational and outreach material. This site also provides many general
   astronomical tools such as SkyView to obtain multiwaveband images of
   the sky and astronomical catalog searches via the HEASARC Browse and
   Astrobrowse archive interfaces. To access archival data from other
   wavebands please visit the NASA Infra-red (IRSA) and UV/optical (MAST)
   archives, as well as the astrophysics service of the NSSDC.

   If you are new to X-ray or gamma-ray data analysis or you are a member
   of the general public, please visit our Frequently Asked Questions area
   which has more information about data analysis and other items of
   interest to the general public.
