   the navigation items will link you to descriptions of those services
   and facilities. If you know what type of information you need, use the
   Search for a Facility link. For more resources, use the links to state

   Image for Benefits Checkup

   The Benefits Check Up is a FREE program that can help you find programs
   and services for which you may be eligible.  The website will ask you
   to answer some questions about yourself and your needs. It then creates
   a list of programs and/or services you may be eligible for and provides
   a local address and phone number for those programs. The information
   you provide is completely confidential.  None of the information you
   give is kept by the NCOA after you complete the Benefits Check Up.

                               Flex Your Power
