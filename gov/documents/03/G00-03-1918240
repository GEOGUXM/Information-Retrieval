   Welcome to the webpage for the Web Interface For Telescience (WITS).

   WITS has been developed to provide Internet-based distributed ground
   operations for planetary lander and rover missions.  WITS provides an
   intergrated environment for operations at a central location and
   collaboration with geographically distributed scientists.

   These pages contain detailed information about WITS and the missions it
   supports.   Begin at the WITS for Polar Lander section.  There you will
   find a public version of WITS that you can download and use on your own
   computer.  The Awards and Publications section contains press coverage,
   papers, and presentations on WITS and its associated tools.  You may
   also enjoy the WITS for Sojourner section, where you can use an earlier
   version of WITS to learn about the 1997 Mars Pathfinder Mission.
