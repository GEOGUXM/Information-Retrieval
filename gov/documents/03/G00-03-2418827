   TEAM Leafy Spurge is a USDA-ARS research and demonstration program
   focused on the Little Missouri River and associated watersheds in
   Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota. Its goal is to
   research, develop and demonstrate ecologically based integrated pest
   management strategies that landowners and land managers can use to
   achieve effective, affordable leafy spurge control.

   TEAM Leafy Spurge is funded as part of the USDA-ARS Area-Wide Program
   and conducted cooperatively with the USDA-Animal and Plant Health
   Inspection Service (APHIS).
