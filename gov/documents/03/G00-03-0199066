   The Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering
   has three goals:
     * To enable the U.S. to uphold a position of world leadership in
       computing, communications, and information science and engineering;
     * To promote understanding of the principles and uses of advanced
       computing, communications and information systems in service to
       society; and
     * To contribute to universal, transparent and affordable
       participation in an information-based society.

   To achieve these, CISE supports investigator initiated research in all
   areas of computer and information science and engineering, helps
   develop and maintain cutting-edge national computing and information
   infrastructure for research and education generally, and contributes to
   the education and training of the next generation of computer
   scientists and engineers. CISE is organized in five divisions, three of
   which focus principally on research, and two which combine both
   infrastructure and research functions.
