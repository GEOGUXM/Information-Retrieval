   A Resource for Federal Agency Executives for Independent, Confidential
   Assessments of IT Programs and Processes by Skilled Federal
   Practitioners

   The ITRB is a group of senior IT, acquisition, and program managers
   with significant experience developing, acquiring, and managing
   information systems in the Federal Government. Members are drawn from a
   cross section of agencies and are selected for their specific skills
   and knowledge. The ITRB provides, at no cost to agencies, peer reviews
   of major Federal IT systems. Through these peer reviews, the ITRB
   identifies practical solutions to actual or potential problems.
