     __________________________________________________________________

   The SAM (Systematic, Accurate, Multiconfiguration calculations) project
   is a collaboration between different atomic physics groups around the
   world to produce, collect and distribute accurate atomic data. The aim
   is not only to reach high accuracy, but also to estimate the
   uncertainty of the final result. This is done by using three different
   quality criteria .
     * List of principal collaborators.
     * Lists of results.
     * Lists of recent publications.
     * Links to other atomic data sites.
     * Question box.
