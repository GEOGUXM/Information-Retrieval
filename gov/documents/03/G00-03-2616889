             Life in the Universe: Is It Just around the Corner?

   In a presentation given on October 10 at Foothill College in Los Altos
   Hills, California, astrobiologist Chris Chyba discusses the
   possibilities for life beyond Earth. He describes what we learned from
   the biology experiments aboard the Viking missions to Mars, and
   outlines the potential for life on Jupiter's moon, Europa. Chyba, a
   former student of renowed astronomer Carl Sagan, is the Director of the
   Center for the Study of Life in the Universe at the SETI Institute and
   a recent recipient of a MacArthur Foundation "Genius" award.

   This web presentation of Chyba's talk consists of audio accompanied by
   slides. It requires RealPlayer.

   European Space Agency: Call for Ideas
   Manned and robotic exploration of solar system planets and bodies will
   be a fascinating challenge and endeavor in the next decades. The
   European Space Agency (ESA) intends to prepare a European long-term
   strategy for the exploration of the Solar System's planets. A program
   proposal will be prepared this year with the intention to give Europe
   an equal footing compared to itÂ’s international partners and to
   federate European initiatives for planetary exploration.

             Ten Thousand Days in the Life of a Science Educator

   Rita Peterson, a Professor at the University of California, Irvine and
   former President of the Pacific Division of the American Association
   for the Advancement of Science discusses the development of science
   education, the problems in current methods, and the importance of
   adapting science education to the needs of today's students. Professor
   Peterson has been involved in science education for nearly thirty
   years, and her research has led to a better understanding of the way in
   which young children develop and progress in today's educational
   environments.

   The article originally appeared in the American Association for the
   Advancement of Science, Pacific Division Newsletter, April 2001, and is

   JASON Project 2002: Frozen Worlds
   Researchers with the JASON Project are now on expedition in Alaska,
   studying the geology, climate change, plants, animals and bacteria of
   this frozen environment. In particular, the team will examine the
   region's astonishing ice worms, creatures that thrive at 0 degrees C
   (32 degrees F) and disintegrate at room temperature. Ice worms may tell
   us whether and how life might be possible on planets such as Jupiter's
   icy moon Europa.

   Follow the progress of the expedition via daily journal updates and
   photos, web chats with the explorers, newscasts on the National
   Geographic Channel, and live webcasts from EDS. The JASON Project is a
   nonprofit educational foundation sponsored by NASA and many other
   organizations.

   Field Trip and Workshop on the Martian Highlands and Mojave Desert
   Analogs
   October 20-27, 2001
   Las Vegas, Nevada, and Barstow, California

   The cratered highlands contain the most complete record of geological
   processes and environments on Mars. Despite a wealth of data from
   spacecraft missions, interpretation of the early history of Mars has
   remained enigmatic and controversial. This field trip and workshop will
   focus on interpretation of processes and environments during the
   Noachian Period and on the Mojave Desert region as a terrestrial
   analog, emphasizing depositional environments in enclosed basins,
   including fans, playas, and lakes.

   Bioastronomy 2002: Life among the Stars
   July 8-12, 2002
   Great Barrier Reef, Australia

   The last few years have seen a rapid growth in the field of
   bioastronomy, which is changing the field from being a minority
   interest to a significant part of mainstream astronomy. This revolution
   has included the following steps forward, most of which has occurred
   since the last IAU-sponsored Bioastronomy meeting in 1999.
