   Welcome and thank you for visiting! BayhPortrait7-99.jpg

   This website is designed to help Hoosiers get the best service possible
   from the federal government and stay up-to-date on my activities on
   behalf of the people of Indiana.

   I recently joined President Bush in Hamilton, Ohio where he signed an
   education reform bill that will transform the federal role in public
   education. The bill is aimed at raising the academic achievement of all
   students by providing state and local school districts with greater
   resources and flexibility, but in turn, requiring accountability for
   results.

   Many of the provisions in this landmark education reform bill are based
   on the Three R's, a bill I co-authored with Senator Joe Lieberman. We
   sought to break from the stale partisan politics of the past, in which
   Democrats said 'spend more money,' and Republicans said 'get the
   federal government out of the way.' We said that success will no longer
   be measured in terms of how much we spend. Instead, we put the focus on
   how much our children learn.

   For the latest information on this, and a few of these Key Issues,
   please take a moment to visit the special pages highlighting my
   continuing efforts on Responsible Fatherhood, Education Reform and the
   War on Terrorism.
