     Kennedy Space Center Materials and Processes (M&P) Control Program
     __________________________________________________________________

   Goal

   The goal of the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) M&P Control Program is to
   ensure that all materials and materials-related processes (e.g.,
   welding, protective coating, etc.) used at KSC perform satisfactorily
   under exposure to the operational and environmental conditions of KSC
   launch and payload processing facilities and systems, at a minimum cost
   to the Government.

   Authority and Scope

   The KSC M&P Control Program is established by KMI 1150.24 and 1164.10,
   with specific requirements defined in KSC-LO-8060.1; the requirements
   apply to all organizational elements at KSC. The KSC M&P Control
   Program requirements cover the selection of M&P to be used in
   facilities, systems, and equipment in all environments in and around
   space vehicles, payloads, ground support equipment, and facilities
   during assembly, test, and launch operations at KSC.

     * KMI 1150.24, Boards, Committees, Working Groups, and Panels (page
       I-2 establishes the Materials Application Advisory Board [MAAB])
     * KMI 1164.10, Delegations, Redelegations, and Designations (page J-1
       establishes the Center Materials Representative to chair the MAAB
       and administer the KSC M&P Control Program)  CANCELED
     * KSC-LO-8060.1, KSC Materials and Processes Control Program
       (contains the detailed requirements of the KSC M&P Control
       Program).
