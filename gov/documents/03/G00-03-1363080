   The Washington Health Care Facilities Authority was created by
   Legislature in 1974 to provide a new source of capital funding for
   modern, well equipped, and reasonably priced health care facilities.
   The Authority was further charged with minimizing costs of capital
   construction, as well as costs to the public for using health care
   facilities, thus contributing to improved quality of health care in
   Washington. (RCW 70.37.010)
   The goal of minimizing capital costs is accomplished by offering tax
   exempt financing to nonprofit health care facilities. Without Authority
   assistance, health care providers would have to borrow at the more
   expensive interest rates of taxable bonds and notes.
   Since it began operation Authority financing has:
   1) Issued a total of more than $4.5 billion in tax exempt revenue
   bonds.
   2) Completed more than 180 separate bond issues.
   3) Reduced non-profit health care providers' interest cost by
   approximately $30 million in 1998, $31 million in 1999, and $34 million
   in 2000.
