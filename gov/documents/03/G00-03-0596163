   Lightning & Atmospheric Electricity Research at the GHCC
   Image_Lightning




   Within the Global Hydrology and Climate Center (GHCC), there is a group
   of researchers, mostly scientists and engineers, who collectively form
   the GHCC Lightning Team. As part of their research activities, the
   members of this team have been investigating the causes and effects of
   lightning as well as analyzing a wide variety of atmospheric
   measurements related to thunderstorms.

   One of the primary objectives of this group is to determine the
   relationship between the electrical characteristics of storms and
   precipitation, convection, and severe weather. In order to achieve this
   objective, the GHCC Lightning Team has designed, constructed and
   deployed numerous types of ground based, airborne, and space based
   sensors used to detect lightning and characterize the electrical
   behavior of thunderstorms. The data collected by the GHCC Lightning
   Team is routinely shared with scientists around the globe, resulting in
   numerous advancements in the field of Atmospheric Science.
