             IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON CONTACTING SENATOR NELSON


   Tallahassee Democrat:
   Nelson shores up support for funds
     * Airline passenger safety
     * Airline worker benefits
     * Military pilots training
     * Seaport security
     * Space shuttle safety

   Proposal would give grants, loans

   Support is growing in Congress for spending more on port security
   because of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson said
   Friday as he toured one of 14 Florida seaports that would benefit.

   Nelson, D-Tallahassee, and Florida's senior senator, Bob Graham,
   D-Miami Lakes, are among co-sponsors of a proposal to give ports across
   the country $434 million in grants and $3.3 billion in loans over five
   years.

   "I think we are going to be able to pass it because of the events that
   have overtaken us," Nelson said at the Port of Pensacola.

                                   nation

    "Tonight showed again how we as Americans all are standing together.
   And, as the president made clear, we will deliver a severe counterblow
     to those who've attacked us. He made equally clear that we will do
      whatever is necessary and appropriate to keep our economy and our
      country strong. And in pursuit of these goals, we will not fail."

                 Defense bill includes overseas ballot plan

    The Senate Armed Services Committee on Friday included in its version
   of the defense budget $250 million in new projects at Florida bases and
    provisions to make it easier for overseas military personnel to vote.

    ``It sends a strong signal to the states that no one in the military
   shall be denied the right to have their vote counted,'' U.S. Sen. Bill
     Nelson, D-Tallahassee, said after the committee approved the budget
                                  measure.

          Experts fear for shuttle safety as NASA budget is trimmed
   Astronauts and ground crew would be endangered by proposed cutbacks in
    space shuttle-safetyimprovements, according to a panel of astronauts,
        industry executives and other experts who testified Thursday.

   NASA planned $1.9 billion in upgrades to the aging shuttle fleet during
         the next five years. Tight budgets and cost overruns at the
     International Space Station, however, have led the space agency to
                               cancel some of
                        those plans and delay others.

    "We're starving NASA's shuttle budget -- and thus greatly increasing
   the chance of a catastrophic loss," said Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., who
   requested the hearing with the Senate Commerce Committee. "I wonder if
                   the lessons of Challenger are fading."

                 Senate vote brings drilling in gulf closer
    Florida lawmakers fight to stop the sale of oil and gas leases until
                       April but fail in a 67-33 vote

    The gap between the drill bit and the ocean floor closed Thursday as
     the Senate upheld the sale of oil and gas leases in Area 181 of the
                           eastern Gulf of Mexico.

    By a 67-33 vote, senators rejected an attempt by Florida lawmakers to
      block the sale of drilling leases until April. Although the House
    passed a similar measure last month, it is likely to be dropped from
                           the final legislation.

     Nelson attacks Boca Raton doctors for charging annual 'access fees'

      Two Boca Raton doctors who have started charging their patients a
    $1,500 annual access fee should be stopped, even if it requires a new
        federal law, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said Wednesday.

     Nelson said he has asked Senate legal staff to research whether the
    fees charged by MDVIP of Boca Raton are legal under current Medicare
      rules. If they are, he plans to introduce a bill to halt federal
   payments to doctors who demand extra fees from their existing Medicare
                                  patients.
