      Welcome to our web site!

   The U.S. Pretrial Services Office for the District of Puerto Rico
   serves the United States District Court in pretrial investigation and
   supervision functions. We cover the geographical area of Puerto Rico,
   which includes the islands of Vieques and Culebra. Seven District
   Judges, three Senior Judges, and three Magistrate-Judges sit in our
   District Court.

      Since its inception in March 1985, our office has evolved into a work
      unit composed of 17 dedicated and dynamic employees. We are very proud
      of the service rendered to our clients and stakeholders, in an
      atmosphere of professionalism and respect for every person's dignity.
      We believe we skillfully combine the qualities of excellent public
      service and the latest technological advancements.

      We now enter our participation in this era of global communications
      through this webpage which we expect you will find interesting. Our
      purpose is to provide information and guidance to those we serve and
      anyone with a didactic interest concerning Pretrial Services functions,
      services and procedures. We welcome your comments and suggestions
      regarding this new endeavor.
