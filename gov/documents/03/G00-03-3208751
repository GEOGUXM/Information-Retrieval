       "Although each executive agency and its field organization have a
       special mission, there are many matters on which the work of the
       departments converge. Among them are management and budgetary
       procedures, personnel policies, recruitment efforts, office
       information duties, and similar matters. There are opportunities to
       pool experience and resources, and to accomplish savings. In
       substantive programs there are also opportunities for a more
       closely coordinated approach in many activities."
       President John F. Kennedy, 1961
       The Federal Executive Boards (FEBs) were established in 1961 by a
       Presidential Directive to improve coordination among Federal
       activities and programs outside Washington. The need for effective
       coordination among the field activities of Federal departments and
       agencies was then, and is still, very clear. Approximately 84
       percent of all Federal employees work outside the national capital
       area. Decisions affecting the expenditure of billions of dollars
       are made in the field. Federal programs have their impact largely
       through the actions of field representatives of the departments and
       agencies. In addition, Federal officials outside Washington are the
       principal contact of the Federal Government with the citizens of
       this country.

     * To this end, the FEBs perform highly valuable functions. FEBs
       provide:
        A forum for the exchange of information between Washington and
       the field about programs, management strategies, and administrative
       challenges
        A point of coordination for the development and operation of
       Federal programs having common characteristics
        A means of communication through which Washington can strengthen
       field understanding and support of management initiatives and
       concerns and
        Federal representation and involvement within their communities
