   Welcome to Telescience Support Center
   Johnson Space Center (JSC) Telescience Support Center (TSC) has been
   developed to support real-time operations for science and technology
   payloads on-board the International Space Station (ISS), especially for
   the on-board experiment. For example, the Human Research Facility (HRF)
   is the U.S. composite flight hardware facility on-board the Space
   Station which is used for human life sciences experiments. The JSC TSC
   supports the scheduling and coordination of the experiments, monitoring
   of hardware performance, archival of data, and remote data distribution
   functions.
   The JSC TSC Intranet is a restricted and access controlled site. To
   gain access to TSC Intranet please submit the online Access Request
   form or download the MS Word version of the application and fax it to
   281-483-4951 for approval by the TSC Operations. The authorized users
   will then be provided with the TSC Access procedures and licensing for
   their windows based systems.
   The JSC TSC home page was created to allow authorized internal and
   remote users to gain access to the TSC Space Life Sciences Mission
   Support activities and real-time data.
   Note: The TSC intranet is prohibited from unauthorized access by Public
   Law 990 474 (The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986) and can result
   in administrative, disciplinary or criminal proceedings.
