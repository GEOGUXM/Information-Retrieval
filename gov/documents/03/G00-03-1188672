      Dear Friends,

      Welcome to New Jersey's 13th District Congressional Web site. I am
      pleased to report that, despite the efforts by terrorists on September
      11th to damage the American spirit, this country is stronger and more
      united than it has ever been.

      I hope you will use this site to learn more about the federal
      government, my work in Congress and the constituent services I offer.
      Most importantly, I am interested in hearing your concerns and comments
      which may be emailed to me at: menendez@mail.house.gov.

      It is truly an honor and a privilege to represent the citizens of New
      Jersey's 13th Congressional District.
      Menendez Signature
      Robert Menendez
      Member of Congress
