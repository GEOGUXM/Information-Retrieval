   Welcome to the Alternative Dispute Resolution Website

   Welcome to the website for the Alternative Dispute Resolution Program
   in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA's ADR
   Program uses mediation to help disputants resolve their differences in
   a way that is satisfactory to everyone. We also offer facilitated
   problem solving, conflict resolution training, and program briefings
   that can be tailored to your needs.
