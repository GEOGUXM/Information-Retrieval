   The Global Positioning System Product Team (GPS PT) web site is
   designed to inform the aviation community and the public on the FAA's
   satellite navigation programs and the efforts of the GPS PT related to
   the development and implementation of these technologies. The site is
   designed for both the novice and the experienced GPS enthusiast and
   will provide updates on the GPS PT's domestic and international
   activities and programs. It also provides documents and briefings
   related to the FAA's satellite navigation program.
