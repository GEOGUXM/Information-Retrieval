   Welcome to the Great Images in NASA library of images.

           GRIN is a collection of over a thousand images of significant
       historical interest scanned at high-resolution in several sizes. This
         collection is intended for the media, publishers, and the general
           public looking for high-quality photographs. Please note that
       downloading these image files may take some time, although searching
                     and browsing should be relatively quick.

       We suggest checking the How to Use GRIN section first, to speed your
      search for photos. Return home (to this page) at anytime by clicking on
                   the GRIN title in the upper left-hand corner.
