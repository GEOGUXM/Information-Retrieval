   NIH Cable Modem is Suspended

   The original NIH Cable Modem Project (Express Net) is being
   transitioned to a new COMCAST service called Broadband Commuter
   Service. NIH is currently working out details with COMCAST which will
   define the roles of each entity. The Parachute web page will be updated
   accordingly.

   High-speed cable modem access to the NIH network is available for
   authorized NIH staff who subscribe to Comcast's data service in
   Montgomery county, Maryland. This remote access service is provided by
   CIT and Comcast for use by the NIH community. It is intended to offer
   related personnel access to NIH and institute computing resources while
   working with a home computer equipped with a high-speed cable modem.
   Employees and authorized users of NIH network systems are reminded that
   NIH e-mail and Internet services are for government use in support of
   the NIH mission.
