   The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is the primary
   focus within the National Cancer Institute for population-based
   research on environmental and genetic determinants of cancer.
   Intramural and collaborative interdisciplinary studies are conducted on
   the distribution, causes, and natural history of cancer, and the means
   for its prevention. Research areas of special interest include genetic
   predisposition, lifestyle factors, environmental contaminants,
   occupational exposures, medications, radiation and infectious agents,
   as well as statistics and methods development.
