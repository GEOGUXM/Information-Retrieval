                    11th International Meshing Roundtable
           September 15-18, 2002, Ithaca, New York (coming soon!)

   Now in its eleventh consecutive year, the International Meshing
   Roundtable has become recognized as an international focal point for
   research and development in the field of mesh and grid generation. The
   goal of the International Meshing Roundtable continues to focus on
   bringing together researchers and developers from academia, national
   labs and industry in a stimulating, open environment for the exchange
   of technical information related to mesh generation and general
   pre-processing techniques. Participants from a wide variety of
   countries can enjoy an open and technically rich environment with which
   to share new ideas and technical advances.
