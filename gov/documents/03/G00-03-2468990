     The Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Team of the National Space Science and
     Technology Center welcomes you to its home page.

     Our group includes scientists and engineers from NASA's Marshall Space
     Flight Center, Universities Space Research Association (USRA) and the
     University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). We are actively involved in
     several projects which are designed to investigate the high energy
     regime of our Solar System and Universe.

     The primary objectives of our research are to study gamma-ray phenomena
     such as pulsars , black holes , other galaxies, gamma-ray bursts , and
     other exotic astrophysical objects.

   Current Projects

   The Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory: Click for BATSE Home Page

   The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, about to be released from Space
   Shuttle Atlantis in 1991 April. The eight BATSE detector modules are
   mounted on the corners of the satellite. Four are visible in the image.
   The Burst and Transient Source Experiment. During 9 years of successful
   operation, the BATSE detectors on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory
   (CGRO) continually recorded observations of gamma-ray bursts, pulsars,
   and other transient gamma-ray phenomena. Although the CGRO mission was
   terminated by NASA in June 2000, new science from BATSE and complete
   data archiving projects continue to occupy members of the GRA team and
   provide services to the high-energy astrophysics community. The
   Principal Investigator of this project is Dr. Gerald J. Fishman.

   The GLAST Burst Monitor. The GLAST Burst Monitor (GBM) is the selected
   secondary instrument for the Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope
   mission. This detector will record observations of high energy
   transient phenomena such as gamma-ray bursts, with a strong emphasis on
   broad-band spectral measurements. The Principal Investigator of this
   project is Dr. Charles A. Meegan. GLAST Artist Concept: Click for GBM
