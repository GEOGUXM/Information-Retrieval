Biosciences Division
     __________________________________________________________________

   Biological and medical research at Argonne National Laboratory seeks to
          develop and apply strategies for anticipating and mitigating the
               adverse health effects of energy-related activities through
    multidisciplinary, long-term programs. Our approach is to characterize
            the structure, composition, and function of important cellular
        molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids and to understand how
     these molecules are affected by nuclear and nonnuclear pollutants. To
    enhance future research opportunities, new experimental facilities are
                    being designed and new techniques are being developed.

Research

   Study of the effects of energy technologies on humans is supported by
   fundamental research in scientific disciplines, including molecular and
   cellular biology, crystallography, biophysics, genetics, radiobiology,
   biochemistry, chemistry, and environmental toxicology.  Our research
   involves the integration of findings from investigations at the
   molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, and whole-animal levels, with the
   ultimate aim of applying these findings to problems of human health.
