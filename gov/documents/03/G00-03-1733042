Nice Pictures, Explanations, Etc.

     An explanation of the Supernova Cosmology Project and our current
   results is given in Berkeley Lab's December 17, 1998 Press Release:
   "Science Magazine's Breakthrough of the Year"

     Click on the top left segment of this Poster from the January 1998
   Meeting of the American Astronomical Society (i.e. the segment that
   looks like this:  [wwwposter1amini.jpg] ), for an explanation of the
   technique developed by the Supernova Cosmology Project to find
   "batches" of newly-exploded very distant supernova, all at one time,
   all "on schedule."
