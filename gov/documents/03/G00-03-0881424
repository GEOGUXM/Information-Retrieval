   We meet every other Wednesday at 10:00 am. The meetings take place in
   Bldg. 6 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Room 2202 (second
   floor close to main entrance). Shuttle service from campus and inside
   LBNL is available. For parking and site information please see a map of
   LBNL. Everyone is welcome to join!

   Here is Encyclopedia Britannica's entry on Spectroscopy.
