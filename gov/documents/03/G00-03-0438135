   Welcome to the NOAA CoastWatch Ocean Product Server

   NOAA CoastWatch has recently expanded its product line of satellite
   remote sensing ocean products to include ocean surface wind and color
   products. Data provided by the Office of Satellite Data Processing and
   Distribution (OSDPD) are processed and made available in near real-time
   through this website (NOAA CoastWatch Operational SST data remain
   accessible through regional nodes). Future enhancements will allow you
   to visualize multiple data sets and retrieve additional satellite
   products.

   Sea surface temperature (SST) products are generated using NOAA
   developed algorithms from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
   (AVHRR). SST images are available in near real-time through this site.
   Data and additional products and formats are available through the
   CoastWatch Regional Nodes.

   Data from ERS-2, DMSP, and QuikSCAT satellites are processed and mapped
   to produce ocean surface wind products. These products are publicly
   available within hours of the satellite pass.

   Turbidity and Chlorophyll-a products are generated using NOAA developed
   algorithms from ocean color sensors. At present, products produced
   using SeaWiFS data are restricted due to limitations associated with
   these commercial data (Data Use Policy). NOAA is also utilizing MODIS
   data. Example MODIS products generated from data obtained from NASA
   GSFC are available for public browsing and download.

   GOES-SST

   The NESDIS Office of Research and Applications has developed algorithms
   to produce sea surface temperature products from NOAA's geostationary
   satellites (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites). More
   information on GOES-SST Products.

   NOAA CoastWatch Program

   The NOAA CoastWatch Program is managed by NOAA NESDIS' Office of
   Research Applications (ORAD) and operates in conjunction with other
   NESDIS offices in Suitland and Camp Springs, Maryland. CoastWatch uses
   eight regional nodes (sites) located within the Continental U.S.,
   Alaska, and Hawaii to develop and distribute satellite data products
