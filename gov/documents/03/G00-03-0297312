    Clouds are critical to understanding the dynamics and chemistry of the
    stratosphere. They are a primary vehicle for stratosphere-troposphere
    exchange. They also influence stratospheric dynamics through gravity wave
    generation, and stratospheric photochemistry by reflecting solar radiation.
    The purpose of the Satellite Weather Information for Stratospheric Science
    (SWISS) project is to provide and interpret cloud imagery for NASA's
    stratospheric aircraft sampling programs, including the Stratospheric
    Tracers of Atmospheric Transport (STRAT) program, the Tropical Ozone
    Transport Experiment (TOTE), and the Vortex Ozone Transport Experiment
    (VOTE).
