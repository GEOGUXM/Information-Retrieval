Stardust Manuevers Towards Comet Encounter

   Artist Rendition of Stardust & Comet Wild-2

   Jan 24, 2002 - NASA's comet-bound spacecraft, Stardust, successfully
   completed a critical deep space maneuver, positioning itself on a
   course to encounter comet Wild 2 in January 2004 and collect dust from
   the comet.

   At 21:56 Universal Time (1:56 p.m. Pacific Time), January 18, Stardust
   fired its thrusters for nearly 111 seconds, increasing the speed of the
   spacecraft by 2.65 meters per second (about 6 miles per hour).

   "This is the maneuver that sets us up for the bigger maneuver. It's a
   combination of increasing the speed of the spacecraft and at the same
   time putting it on the path to reach Wild 2," said Robert Ryan,
   Stardust's mission manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
   Pasadena, Calif. "It's like the setup pass in a basketball game. Now
   we're ready to shoot the basket."
