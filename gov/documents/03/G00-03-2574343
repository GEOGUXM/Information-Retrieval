   Welcome to the official website of the United States Bankruptcy Court
   for the District of Puerto Rico. This site has been created with the
   Judges, the Bar and the public in mind, in order to deliver a
   timesaving and forward-moving service, using the advanced electronic
   tools available as we enter a new millennium. It provides access to
   public information which was previously available directly through our
   office. This site contains updated general information such as office
   hours, filing of documents, fees, calendars, Local Rules, General
   Orders, and Answers to Frequently Asked Questions. Also available is
   the Bankruptcy Case Information entered during the last 24 hours.
   Please feel free to browse our site and/or e-mail your suggestions to
   the court.

   Thank you for visiting us.

   Celestino Matta-Méndez, Esq. Clerk of the Court
