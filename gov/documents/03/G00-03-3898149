            The Space Environment and Effects (SEE) Program
             collects, develops, and disseminates the SEE-related
             technologies required to design, manufacture and
             operate more reliable, cost-effective spacecraft for the
             government and commercial sectors.

             In partnership with industry, academia, and other
             goverment agencies, the SEE Program defines the
             space environments and advocates technology
             development to accommodate or mitigate these harmful
             environments on spacecraft; hence the technology is
             transferred to spacecraft developers for incorporation in
             design.
                                                                         spacer

                    The SEE Program establishes new plateaus of technical
     capability to reduce
                    cost of NASA's science and exploration missions which
     enables new and more
                    challenging missions.
