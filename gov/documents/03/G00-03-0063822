   NASA/JSC is the lead NASA center for orbital debris research and is
   recognized world-wide for its leadership in addressing orbital debris
   issues. The orbital debris research team has taken the international
   lead in conducting measurements of the environment and in developing
   the technical consensus for adopting mitigation measures to protect
   users of the orbital environment. Work at the center continues with
   developing an improved understanding of the orbital debris environment
   and measures that can be taken to control its growth.

   The Orbital Debris Research Project is divided into the following broad
                              research efforts:

                      Modeling FAQ's     Measurement
                     Protection          Mitigation
                     Orbital Debris Quarterly Newsletter

   United Nations Technical Report on Space Debris
   US Government Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices
   MS Word or Adobe PDF
   History of On-Orbit Satellite Fragmentations
   Orbital Debris is described in detail in Orbital Debris: A Technical
   Assessment available on line through the National Research Council.
   Also available on line is the The National Science and Technology
   Council Committee on Transportation Research and Development
   Interagency Report on Orbital Debris.
