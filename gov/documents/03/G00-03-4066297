      The U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation of satellites
      plays a major role in regional and global studies of Earth. In the face
      of continued growth and diversification of GPS applications, the
      worldwide scientific community has made an effort to promote
      international standards for GPS data acquisition and analysis, and to
      deploy and operate a common, comprehensive global tracking system.

      As part of this effort, the International GPS Service (IGS), along with
      a multinational membership of organizations and agencies, provides GPS
      orbits, tracking data, and other high-quality GPS data and data
      products on line in near real time to meet the objectives of a wide
      range of scientific and engineering applications and studies.

      The Global Data Centers archive and provide on-line access to tracking
      data and data products. The online data are employed by the Analysis
      Centers to create a range of products, which are then transmitted to
      the Global Data Centers for public use. This web site is part of the
      IGS Central Bureau Information System (CBIS), providing both IGS member
      organizations and the public with a gateway to all the IGS global data
      and data product holdings, as well as other valuable information.
