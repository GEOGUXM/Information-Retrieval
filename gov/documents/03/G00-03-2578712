   Color Mineral Map of Cuprite Nevada Researchers at the USGS
   Spectroscopy Lab are studying and applying methods for identifying and
   mapping materials through spectroscopic remote sensing (called imaging
   spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging, imaging spectrometry,
   ultraspectral imaging, etc), on the earth and throughout the solar
   system using laboratory, field, airborne and spacecraft spectrometers.

   The image shown here is a mineral map, where each color is the
   identification of specific minerals through imaging spectroscopy
   analysis. See Material Maps and Spectral Libraries (also accessed

  Spectroscopy and Imaging Spectroscopy

  Spectrum Icon Spectroscopy and Principles of Spectroscopy

          Extensive tutorial on reflectance spectroscopy, the causes of
          absorption bands, the absorption and scattering processes that
          occur when light encounters a particulate surface, and
          principles of spectroscopy including continuum analysis, grain
          size effects, mixtures, etc. (June 25, 1999)

  Camera Icon What is Imaging Spectroscopy?

          A tutorial on what imaging spectroscopy is, what it can be used
          for, and what it takes to plan, request, calibrate, and analyze
          AVIRIS data (May 24, 2000).

  Library Icon USGS Digital Spectral Library

          Reflectance spectra on minerals, vegetation, and miscellaneous
          stuff. You can ftp download the main spectral library or
          versions convolved to various remote sensing spectrometers such
          as the NASA/JPL Airborne Visual and Infra-Red Imaging
          Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Also, you can view spectra online
          Spectral Library Detailed Plots and Sample Descriptions: view
          spectra online or download and view them offline on your laptop
          while on the road! (Jan 8, 2000). Hot
