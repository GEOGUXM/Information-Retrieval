   Welcome to our New Web Pages

   These web pages are re-designed for you—people who enjoy recreational
   activities on water, people who care about the condition of our water
   resources, people who drink or otherwise use water, and people who
   manage or regulate water resources. Most of the information in these
   web pages is about Michigan District activities, however we also
   provide you with many, many links to other water-resource sites and
   other USGS sites. I hope that you find the information on these web
   pages to be helpful, interesting, and informative.

   Many of the changes to our web pages are functional and
   self-explanatory—the changes are designed to make our information more
   accessible, interesting, and useful. We have retained the basic top
   navigation bar that you use to access main areas of our pages. The
   former "bullets" are retained as Quick Links on the left navigation bar
   and are accessible from many of the main pages. A major change to these
   pages is content. Specifically, we updated all of the pages that
   describe recent and ongoing projects. All of our basic monitoring data
   are available on the new USGS NWISweb pages via these web pages.

   We are now serving over 500 web pages, not including monitoring data on
   NWISweb. Although we have reviewed most of these pages carefully, we
   would greatly appreciate your comments, suggestions, or corrections.
   Please direct these to our webmaster, Marie Reynolds, who did nearly
   all of the great work in redesigning these pages. An email link to
   Marie is at the bottom of this page.

   These pages are updated on a regular basis, so we trust you will come
   back often to see what we have to offer.
