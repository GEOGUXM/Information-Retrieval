   Inspection Connection Seafood Inspection Program * U.S. Department of
   Commerce/NOAA Vol. 2 No. 3 Winter 2001 Services to Importers Often
   Overlookedby Steven Wilson Most of the industry is familiar with the
   Seafood Inspection Program's product and facility inspection services.
   Many are also aware of our services with regard to HACCP and training.
   Often overlooked, however, is how our services can be used to satisfy
   Federal requirements to import food into the United States. One aspect
   of 21 CFR Part 123, the USFDA regulations on HACCP activities for
   seafood firms, lists those requirements for firms who import seafood
   products into the United States. This typically includes brokers and
   retail firms. Firms importing seafood products into the United States
   must either import from a country that has an active agreement with the
   USFDA, no agreements are currently operational, or have and implement
   written verification procedures to ensure the products entering the
   United States have complied with Federal regulations. The verification
   procedures must include product specifications and any one of the
   affirmative steps listed below: · Obtaining HACCP and sanitation
   monitoring records · A continuing lot-by-lot certificate from the
   foreign government or competent third party · Regular inspection of the
   foreign processing facility · Periodic testing of the imported product
   and maintaining the firm's HACCP plan and written guarantee, in English
   · Other equivalent methods The Seafood Inspection Program can assist
   importers in developing procedures, setting up a testing program, or
   conducting audits of overseas facilities. In fact, the Program has been
   providing these services for years, and the number of participants is
   steadily increasing. Anyone interested in such services can contact
   either Kenneth Aadsen or Steven Wilson at 301-713-2355 for more
   information. Pay Your Inspection Bill Online - Update by Rita Creitz In
   the last issue of the Inspection Connection, we reported that our
   on-line payment option, supported by the U.S. Department of the
   Treasury, was planned to be available by the summer of 2001. While
   steady progress continues, the launch date for the option has slipped
   by several months. The Inspection Program's on-line payment option will
   enhance, but not replace, our current method of mailing bills to
   customers. We will continue to issue inspection bills the "good
   old-fashioned" way. If you're curious about the overall U.S. Treasury
   initiative, visit www.pay.gov and check it out! 2 Inspection Connection
