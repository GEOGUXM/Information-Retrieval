    HERMES generates a 3D picture (rebar mesh) of a bridge deck interior.


       64 radars generate a 3D picture of a bridge deck at 3-cm resolution

                                       Inspects full deck in a single pass

                                                 Operates at highway speed

                                                    "Sees" through asphalt

                                               Promotes safety for workers
