                      The Washington, DC, Exhibit Hall

   The exhibit halls of the National Archives Building in downtown
   Washington, DC, are closed for renovation. They will reopen in 2003.

   American Originals logo During the renovation, a traveling version of
   our "American Originals" exhibit, featuring some of the nation's most
   celebrated documents from the holdings of the National Archives, will
   be making a grand eight-city tour beginning in fall 2001.

   When the exhibit halls reopen, visitors will be welcomed to a new,
   state-of-the-art, public exhibition space in which documents from the
   National Archives will be complemented by media presentations, computer
   interactives, and immersive environments. A new Learning Center will
   offer an exciting schedule of interactive workshops, lectures, films,
   and tours.
