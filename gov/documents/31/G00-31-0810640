   INTRODUCTION


      This section contains the policies, regulations, and statutes under
      which ORI operates. The Federal policy requires all government agencies
      to establish policies for handling allegations of research misconduct
      in their intramural and extramural research programs. The HHS
      (Department of Health and Human Services) policies redefine the mission
      of ORI and the role of the Assistant Secretary for Health in the
      adjudication of research misconduct cases, and provides guidelines for
      hearings before the Departmental Appeals Board. The PHS (Public Health
      Service) policy (currently suspended) requires all institutions to
      provide training in the responsible conduct of research to their
      research staff who are supported by or working on PHS funded research.
      The regulation and statute sections provide statutory authority for
      ORI, the handling of research misconduct allegations, debarments, the
      protection of whistleblowers employed by the Federal government, and
      Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.
