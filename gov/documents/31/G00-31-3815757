   ICCVAM Members

   Members Roster in PDF

   ICCVAM (The Committee) is made up of 47 members representing 15 U.S.
   Federal Agencies.  ICCVAM determines which assays are ready for the
   validation process, i.e. peer review, expert scientific panel review or
   test method workshop (see the Alternative Methods Page).  Based on the
   results of ICCVAM's validation process, the Committee may recommend
   alternative test methods to U.S. Federal agencies, who then draft
   Guidelines or Regulations.

   The ICCVAM Members are listed below. This list is organized by agency.
   Select the name of the agency to view that agency's representative(s),
