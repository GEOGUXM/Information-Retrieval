   The three space shuttle main engines (SSME's) are housed in the
   tail-end of the orbiter. The ET is the fuel tank for the main engines.
   During ascent, the ET provides liquid fuel to the SSME'S at the rate of
   over 1,000 gallons per second. The SRB's, which burn solid propellant,
   provide more than 70 percent of the shuttle's thrust during the first
   two minutes of ascent. Though the MSFC SSPO is responsible only for the
   SSME's, ET, and SRB's, the shuttle actually has over 60 rockets,
   including the 25-pound attitude thrusters and the small motors that
   separate the boosters from the shuttle.

   Below are the most popular facts and figures about the Space Shuttle
   system. These facts and figures cover the orbiter, and the propulsion
   systems that are managed by the Shuttle Projects Office at the Marshall
   Space Flight Center. This list is not all-inclusive. For further
   detail, we direct you to the . . .
   Space Shuttle Reference Manual.
