   Office of National Drug Control Policy Drug Policy Information
   Clearinghouse Guam Profile of Drug Indicators September 2001 ONDCP Drug
   Policy Information Clearinghouse staff compiled this profile by using
   the most recent data available from open sources. The data presented
   are as accurate as the sources from which they were drawn. The
   information contained in this profile should not be used to rank or
   compare States or jurisdictions, due to differences in data collection
   and reporting methods. Guam The following profile contains information
   on demographics, political figures, programs, crime, drug use, drug
   trafficking, and enforcement statistics. Demographics1 ÿ Population:
   154,623 (July 2000 est.) Age/Gender: 0-14 years: 34.9% (male 28,233;
   female 25,727); 15-64 years: 59.09% (male 48,126; female 43,238); 65
   years and over: 6.01% (male 4,680; female 4,619) (2000 est.) ÿ Ethnic
   groups: Chamorro 47%, Filipino 25%, white 10%, Chinese, Japanese,
   Korean, and other 18% ÿ Economy: The economy depends mainly on U.S.
   military spending and on tourist revenue. Over the past 20 years, the
   tourist industry has grown rapidly, creating a construction boom for
   new hotels and the expansion of older ones. More than 1 million
   tourists visit Guam each year. The industry suffered a setback in 1998
   because of the continuing Japanese recession; the Japanese normally
   make up almost 90% of the tourists. Most food and industrial goods are
   imported. Guam faces the problem of building up the civilian economic
   sector to offset the impact of military downsizing. ÿ Geography: Guam
   is located in Oceania. The island is in the North Pacific Ocean, about
   three-quarters of the way from Hawaii to the Philippines. The island
   has a total land area of 541.3 sq. km. Politics2 ÿ Guam is an
   organized, unincorporated territory of the United States. ÿ U.S. House
   Representative: Robert Underwood (D) ÿ Guam Senate: Speaker Anthony
   Unpigco, Mark Forbes, Eduardo B. Calvo, Kaleo Moylan, Alberto C.
   Lamorena, Carlotta Leon Guerrero, Joanne M.S. Brown, Simon A. Sanchez,
   Frank B. Aguon, Eulogio Bermudes, Anthony C. Blaz, John Salas, Larry
   Kasperbauer, and Vicente C. Pangelinan (minority leader).3 ÿ Governor:
   Carl T.C. Gutierrez (D) and Lieutenant Governor Madeleine Z. Bordallo
   Programs/Initiatives4 ÿ To reduce drug trafficking and drug-related
   violent crime in Guam, the Byrne Program has formed several task
   forces. This includes the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Task
   Force, the Drug Detector Dog Unit Task Force, the Maritime Task Force;
   which deals closely with the U.S. Coast Guard; and the Street Level
   Drug Task Force; which links the Guam Police Department directly with
   the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ONDCP Clearinghouse 2 ÿ
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation is committed to providing Guam with
   direct linkage to Washington's online sex offender registry.5 ÿ The
   Guam Police Department and the Superior Court of Guam use the Local Law
   Enforcement Block Grants (LLEBG) Program for improvements and
   technology projects that are not fully funded, or that can no longer be
   funded, under the Byrne Program, such as; updating police-patrol and
   arrestee-transport vehicles, equipment for new police academy
   graduates, police radios, firearms, and firing-range supplies, new
   computer systems such as the document management and retrieval system,
   criminal Justice Information Systems data enhancement, and Justice Wide
   Area Network program communication lines, and electronic coverage of
   police academy training cycles. ÿ The Residential Substance Abuse
   Treatment (RSAT) Program provides services for criminals being
   released. Funding has also been used to implement the first drug
   rehabilitation center for incarcerated inmates. Treatment6 ÿ
   Methamphetamine abuse ("ice") is a growing concern in Guam where one in
   five families estimated having at least one family member experiencing
   physical complications consistent with methamphetamine use. A review of
   136 treatment centers from Guam's Department of Mental Health and
   Substance Abuse showed an increase in methamphetamine admissions over
   the years. "Approximately half of the individuals admitted for
   treatment of an alcohol or drug problem were methamphetamine users...
   Approximately two-thirds of methamphetamine users admitted for
   treatment in Guam meet standards of psychiatric criteria for either
   methamphetamine abuse or dependence." Crime and Drugs7 ÿ It has been
   reported that Guam's crime rate has declined in the past year,
   according to new statistics released by the Guam police department.
   There was a 30 per cent decrease in major crimes reported from January
   to September 1998 compared to the same period in the previous year. The
   number of reported offences in the major crime categories, including
   murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, theft,
   motor vehicle theft and arson, as estimated for the first three
   quarters of 1998, is 7,036. The police department attributes the drop
   in crime to the increase in officers on the streets, more neighborhood
   patrols and activation of a new highway patrol section. The prevalence
   of drugs on the island is perhaps the single most significant factor
   affecting crime rates. The largest crime rate increase in recent years
   came in 1997. To combat the island's drug problem, the police
   department continues to run preventive and outreach programs.
   Juveniles8 ÿ According to a survey of substance abuse among Guam high
   school youth, there was an increase in alcohol, marijuana, and "other"
   substances in Guam between 1995 and 1997. Among "other" substances
   preferred by youth because of low expense were inhalants, more so than
   "ice." ONDCP Clearinghouse 3 ÿ In 1998, 48.70% of high school youth
   surveyed in Guam preferred marijuana as their drug of choice. Drug of
