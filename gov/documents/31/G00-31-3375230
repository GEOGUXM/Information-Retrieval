   Questions and Answers
   Q. How much has Southern California grown since the last census?
   A. Since the 1990 Census, the Southern California region has grown from
      14.6 million to 16.5 million.  An increase of 12.81%.  All of the
      counties in the SCAG region experienced a growth of at least 12% with
      the exception of Los Angeles County, which grew by 7.4%. In absolute
      numbers L.A. County grew by 656,286 which was the highest increase in
      the state.
   Q. Are the census figures on track with SCAG’s previous projections?
   A. The census counts were approximately 2% lower (340,608) than SCAG
      previous projections of 16,856,614. Most of the difference was
      attributable to Los Angeles County (277,516).
   Q. How do the census figures compare to the state’s own projections?
   A. The state’s population projections were also higher than our census
      counts. The Department of Finance has argued that the difference is
      attributable to an undercount of the population in California, which
      has been reported as 529,782.
   Q. Do these numbers indicate that growth rates throughout the state are
      generally consistent?
   A. The growth rates across the state ranged from a decrease of 2.4 % in
      Modoc County to an increase of 45.1% in San Benito County. However, the
      greatest increases continued to be in the Inland Empire and the Central
      Valley. These areas grew at a higher rate than the remaining portions
      of the state. The Inland Empire (Riverside and San Bernardino Counties)
      added over 666,000 persons between 1990 and 2000. The increase is
      comparable to the entire population of Kern County.
   Q. Which areas of the region saw the most explosive growth?
   A. The Inland Empire continued to grow at the highest rate both in the
      SCAG region and statewide. In Imperial County the City of Calipatria
      grew 171% between 1990 and 2000, with the increase primarily the result
      of the opening of a prison facility within the city. In Los Angeles
      County the city with largest percent increase was Lancaster. Orange
      County’s fastest growing city was Tustin at 33.2%. Riverside County’s
      fastest growing city was La Quinta with a growth of 111%, which was
      similar to the growth rate of Adelanto (113%) in San Bernardino County.
      Ventura County’s fastest growth city was Moorpark at 23.2%
   Q. Which area of the region saw the least growth?
   A. The slowest growing cities by County were Holtville (Imperial
      County) at 16.4%, Vernon (LA County) –40.1%, Villa Park (Orange County)
      –4.8%, Norco (Riverside County) 3.7%, Needles (San Bernardino County)
      –7.0% and Ojai (Ventura County) 3.3%. In total there were 16 cities out
      of 185 that experienced a population decrease between 1990 and 2000.
   Q. Have Hispanics become the majority ethnic group in Southern
      California?
   A. The Hispanic population now represents the largest ethnic group
      (40.57%) followed by White (38.85%), Asian (10.19%) and African
      American (7.30%). The white population represents the largest ethnic
      group in Orange County (51.26%), Riverside County (51.04%), and Ventura
      County (56.75%). The Hispanic population is the largest ethnic group in
      Imperial County at 72.22%. Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties have
      no majority ethnic group.
