                               The IDEA/MAUI Project

                                    Description

       Motivated by the desire of design analysts to apply a diverse set of
      computational tools in distributed environment to explore design space
          and to optimize or imporve these designs, we are developing the
            IDEA/MAUI system. IDEA, which stands for Integrated Design,
      Exploration, and Analsys provides a unified framework and asynchronous
           communication system to allow various computing platforms to
      participate in a single design session consisting of the application of
      several tools to a model of the design. MAUI is a general GUI front end
      useable with the IDEA system. MAUI automatically produces a GUI from an
        XML description of the tools and applications. Thus a developer of
      IDEA/MAUI applications only needs to concentrate on the details of the
           application and tools, not at all on the GUI or the network.

         IDEA/MAUI is being used successfully in several important Sandia
       applications. It is providing the front end to generate the input for
        the CALORE code of SIERRA and is being considered for other SIERRA
         codes. It will be connedted to an important parameter-estimation
         application based on ALEGRA where it will be used to facillitate
       multiple runs of ALEGRA over a cluster of machines. IDEA/MAUI is also
      being developed as a fron-end to the DAKOTA system and independently to
               the Opt++ and DDACE systems. (Recent slides on IDEA.)

                      Our design is based on these criteria:
        * New tools should be easy to add, independent of the language in
          which they are written. This implies that ``legacy'' codes can be
          driven by the system, but, of course, limited monitoring of the
          process of such codes can be achieved. Codes that take advantage of
          some of the tools in the IDEA system can be monitored, altered, and
          halted through the \maui\ front end.
        * The GUI should be flexible, allowing development and modifications
          to be easy. This is accomplished by having the GUI completely
          defined by an XML description of the process. Thus if a new tool
          becomes available or a new parameter needs to be included, a small
          change in the XML is all that is required. Although \maui\ is
          written in Java, which has excellent features for GUIs, a user need
          not know any Java to exploit this system.
        * Tools can run on a variety of platforms. Our design allows a user
          running on a very modest workstation to invoke and control
          processes running on a set of processing platforms up to and
          including ASCI platforms.
        * The system should be secure. Our communication scheme is based on
          the use of sockets, with implementations in both Java and C++. Thus
          the security of the connections between participating platforms can
          be made secure by taking advantage of the General Security
          Framework (GFS) that replaces standard sockets by special sockets
          with appropriate security.
