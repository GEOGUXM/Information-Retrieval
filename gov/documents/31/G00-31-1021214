   The Fellowship Office of the National Cancer Institute is a focal point
   for NCI Fellows. We work in partnership with existing NCI and NIH
   components, as an innovator to ensure that the NCI continues to attract
   and retain the best postdoctoral fellows.

   You are welcome to visit us at 31 Center Drive, Room 3A44, Bethesda,
   Maryland 20892-2440. We invite your comments and questions! For more
   information, email or call us on (301) 496-4796.

   For fellows already at NCI, we focus on issues such as referral for
   services and resources, stipends and benefits, training (including
   grantcraft), career development, transition awards, and mentoring to
   connect and augment initiatives currently in place. At the same time,
   we work with existing NCI and NIH components to attract the best
   fellows. The Fellowship Office works with others in a complementary
   role in academic outreach, networking and transitioning.

   For former NCI fellows, we are building an alumni network. This will be
   a career resource for those completing a fellowship.

   We work in partnership with the NCI's scientific leadership, the Office
   of Diversity and Employment Programs, the Administrative Resource
   Centers, and the NIH community at large.

   We are an "Open Door" for current and incoming postdoctoral fellows.
   The Fellowship Office has five major areas of activity: recruitment,
   training, referral, career development, and transition awards.

     Recruitment: We are actively collecting curricula vitae for our
     Principal Investigators who are seeking high quality candidates.

     Training: In partnership with institute leadership and senior
     investigators, we help identify training needs and ensure that NCI
     provides a broad range of training for fellows and guidance for
     mentors.

     Referrals: We connect fellows with available resources to meet both
     quality-of-life and scientific needs. We are available for problem
     resolution, ensuring that issues are heard and referrals made.

     Career Development: In conjunction with the preceptor, we will
     enrich the postdoctoral experience and assist fellows with career
     guidance for their future endeavors.

     Transition Awards: We partner with extramural staff to prepare
     fellows to compete for transition awards and research grants as they
     develop into independent investigators.
