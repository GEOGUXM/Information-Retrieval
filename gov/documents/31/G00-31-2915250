   We've got a big crowd coming to Kansas City! Both workshop hotels are
   filled, and we're scrambling to find more rooms for Energy 2001
   attendees.

   If you still do not have a hotel reservation, check the following to
   see if space is available (note that we do not have room blocks or
   special rates at these hotels):
     * Best Western Hotel on Kansas side 913-677-3060
     * Quarterage Hotel in Westport 816-931-0001
     * Doubletree Hotel downtown 816-474-6664

   These have been recommended to us, but there are other hotels downtown
   and nearby. Make your plans now as all hotels are filling up fast.
