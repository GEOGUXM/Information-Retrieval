     U.S. Information Research Centers are located in Canberra and
     Sydney. They are reference centers only specializing in current U.S.
     policy and legislation covering such fields as trade, politics and
     government, foreign affairs, economics, and defense. They receive
     the most prominent periodicals in these fields.

     The research centers also carry copies of federal legislation and
     can determine status, text and information about bills currently
     before the U.S. Congress.

     If you are interested in searching for information about the United
     States or you require articles, fact sheets, statements or speeches
     by senior administration officials about particular aspects of
     international affairs, visit our International Information Program
