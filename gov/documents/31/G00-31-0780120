   SEU Year 2000 Cosmic Journeys Roadmap

   Solicitation of Community Input to the SEU Roadmap

   NASA's Structure and Evolution of the Universe (SEU) Theme is updating
   its Roadmap in support of the NASA Office of Space Science (OSS)
   strategic planning process. The Roadmap and Strategic Plan will cover
   the years 2003-2028. A Roadmap Team has been formed with the following
   Charter. The team will report back to the Structure and Evolution of
   the Universe Subcommittee (SEUS). The roadmapping process will be
   completed by the fall of 2002.

   The SEU Roadmap Team solicits community input in the form of white
   papers describing mission concepts (principally for the years 2011+
   after Constellation-X, GLAST, LISA, and Planck/Herschel) or strategic
   activities (e.g., laboratory astrophysics, multi-mission technology
   development, theoretical efforts) which support the SEU theme.
   Requirements for the structure of submitted white papers are described
   below. They may be submitted electronically here. The deadline is
   January 31, 2002.

   The roadmap team will be actively soliciting white papers on some
   missions and activities. To avoid duplication of effort, you are urged
   to discuss your ideas with like-minded colleagues and/or members of the
   roadmap team before submitting a white paper.

   The current members of the Roadmap team are: Sterl Phinney (chair),
   Paul Hertz (ex-officio, NASA/HQ), Sean Carroll, Sarah Church, Roy Gould
   (E/PO), Craig Hogan, Rocky Kolb (ex-officio), Dan Lester, Steven Kahn,
   Robert March, Michael Shull, Simon Swordy, and Nicholas White. Contact
   information is here.
   Scope of NASA's Structure and Evolution of the Universe Theme.

   The science objectives of the SEU Theme are:
     * To understand the structure of the universe, from its earliest
       beginnings to its ultimate fate.
     * To explore the cycles of matter and energy in the evolving
       universe.
     * To explore the ultimate limits of gravity and energy in the
       universe.
     * To elucidate the fundamental laws of physics.

   Scope of the 2003 Roadmap

   The 2003 Roadmap will cover the years 2003-2028. The 2003 Roadmap will
   consider all space missions (with the exception of those which should
   be realized as Explorer missions -see criteria) and related scientific
   and techological activities relevant to the SEU science objectives.
   This includes observations of the universe using particles,
   gravitational waves, or electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength and
   tests of the fundamental laws of physics relevant to astrophysics and
   cosmology. The 2000 SEU Roadmap, covering the years 2003-2023, may be
   found here.

   The SEU science objectives may be focused across a broad range of
   astrophysics and are intended to be complimentary to the science
   objectives of NASA's Astronomical Search for Origins Theme (including
   the major Origins missions: NGST, SIM, TPF). Previous SEU Roadmaps have
   identified high priority mission sets which support the breadth of SEU
   science. NASA realizes that all high priority science objectives cannot
   be realized first. The charter of the 2003 SEU Roadmap Team directs the
   Roadmap Team to identify and articulate the highest priority science
   objective and the mission set needed to address that objective. It is
   anticipated that the Roadmap Team will identify additional
   high-priority science objectives and missions that do not support the
   highest priority science objective; these objectives and missions will
   be identified in an appendix to the Roadmap. Implementing these other
   objectives and missions will be addressed in future Roadmaps. All high
   priority science objectives cannot be implemented first.
   Format of White Papers

   We solicit two categories of white papers. Both are subject to
     * Page limit: Four (4) text pages, plus up to two (2) pages of
       figures.
     * Format: PDF or PostScript.
     * Deadline: January 31, 2002.

   Category 1: Missions

   Descriptions of mission concepts (principally for the years 2011+ after
   Planck/Herschel, LISA, GLAST, Constellation-X). Mission concepts must
   be those which cannot or should not be funded as part of NASA's
   Explorer line (e.g. becausethey cost more than $180M or because a
   non-NASA partner contributes more than 25% of the mission cost).

   Category 2: Non-mission Activities

   Descriptions of major non-mission activities which could be funded by
   the SEU theme. Examples include, but are not limited to, laboratory
   astrophysics, multi-mission technology or software development, and
   theoretical efforts.

   The mission-concept white papers may follow any format fitting in the
   page limit above, but must clearly address each of the following seven
   points.
    1. What are the principal science goals of this mission, and what new
       areas of discovery space does it open?
    2. How does the mission bear on science priorities as expressed in the
       various National Academy survey reports?
          + NAS Committee on Gravitational Physics (1999)
          + NAS Astronomy and Astrophysics Survey Commitee (2001)
          + NAS Committee on Physics of the Universe (2001)
          + NAS Physics Survey Overview Committee (2001)
    3. How does the proposed mission or its technology address national
       priorities other than curiosity driven-research? This may be
       especially important if NASA is to justify new funding in the
       fiscal climate, with new demands on a severely constrained budget.
    4. How does the mission build upon accomplishments of other NASA space
       science missions, and fit into the strategic plan under which OSS
       now operates? Is this mission in part a technological precursor to
       more advanced missions? If so, what are they and their goals?
    5. How do the timescale and goals of this mission compare with those
       of non-NASA missions? Are there likely to be strategic advantages
       in international collaboration?
    6. What precursor R&D activity is required to ensure the success of
       the mission? In what areas of advanced technology would investments
       most strongly impact cost and performance? In what research areas
       would investments most strongly impact data analysis and
       interpretation?
    7. What kind of partnerships are envisioned for this mission (e.g.,
       academic, international, other US government agency, industrial)?

   Submission of White Papers

   Note: By default, all submitted white papers will be considered public,
   and will be publicly posted on the Roadmap Web site here. If (e.g.,
   because of industrial agreements) it is absolutely necessary that the
   documents have private proprietary sections, these should be separated
   from the main document, clearly identified, and submitted separately.
   These portions will be available to the Roadmap committee, the SEUS,
   and the working groups from which they may seek advice, but will not
   otherwise be made public. Deadline is 5pm EST Jan 31, 2002.

   White papers (in PDF or PostScript format) may be emailed to
   tyler@lheapop.gsfc.nasa.gov with a subject line containing the words
   "SEU Roadmap white paper", "Category n" [1 or 2], "<title of white
   paper>".
