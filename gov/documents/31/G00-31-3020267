                             Loan Consolidation

     O
   ne or more Direct Loans, FFEL Program loans, Perkins loans, and certain
   educational loans made by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
   Services (HHS) may be consolidated. When you consolidate multiple
   loans, you will receive one loan and one monthly bill. This means that
   you will not need to file forms, such as deferment and forbearance
   requests with multiple lenders.

   A consolidation loan can simplify your loan repayment process. However,
   you must be a wise consumer when consolidating loans. You should read
   all loan materials carefully and ask questions concerning the effects
   loan consolidation will have on you. Not all consolidation loans have
   the same terms, conditions, and interest rates. A good place to start
   your research is your current lender. Also, review the Department of
   Education's Direct Loan Consolidation website
