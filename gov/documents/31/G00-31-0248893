              Congress United Behind Bush on Fight Against Terrorism

   (Democrats diverge from his views on economic recovery, tax cuts)

   Washington -- Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives
   have expressed strong support for President Bush's pledge in his State
   of the Union address January 29 to keep up the war against terrorism
   that was begun in Afghanistan.

   But -- while couching their comments in unusually muted terms for
   opposition party members reacting to a presidential speech --
   Democratic legislators nevertheless voiced substantially less
   enthusiasm over his plans for the domestic economy.

   Republican leaders, predictably, expressed themselves in much fuller
   agreement with the president across the board.

   Delivering his party's formal response immediately after Bush gave his
   speech to a joint session of Congress, House Minority (Democratic)
   Leader Richard Gephardt stressed that Democrats and Republicans stand
   with "one resolve" to defeat terrorists abroad and guard against their
   efforts at home.

   "To our enemies, we say with one voice: no act of violence, no threat
   will drive us apart or steer us from our course -- to protect America
   and preserve our democracy," Gephardt said. "And make no mistake about
   it, we are going to hunt you down and make you pay."

   But, though he repeatedly counseled bipartisanship, Gephardt made
   clear that support for the president in the battle against terrorism
   does not obligate the Democrats to support him on economic policies
   with which they disagree.

   While Bush has proposed significant tax cuts for individuals and
   businesses, Gephardt cited American values that "call for helping the
   unemployed, not just large corporations and the most fortunate." The
   Democratic leader -- seen as a likely contender for his party's
   presidential nomination in 2004 -- called for a bipartisan White House
   summit on economic growth.

   While Bush, in his speech, avoided direct mention of the recent
   bankruptcy of Enron Corp., the energy trading company whose financial
   practices have produced multiple congressional investigations,
   Gephardt used it as a case in point in calling for new steps aimed at
   "protecting pensions from corporate mismanagement and abuse."

   And Gephardt said the Enron case underscores the need for campaign
   finance reform -- a contentious issue in Congress. "If the nation's
   largest bankruptcy coupled with a clear example of paid political
   influence isn't a prime case for reform, I don't know what is," he
   said.

   Still, the Democratic leader made clear that he believes the same
   bipartisanship that has marked the war on terrorism can be applied in
   economic matters as well. "I refuse to accept that while we stand
   shoulder to shoulder on the war, we should stand toe to toe on the
   economy," he said.

   Senate leaders of both parties struck the theme of cooperation too.

   Senate Minority (Republican) Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said
   bipartisanship will be "particularly hard with it being an election
   year." But, he added, "the American people expect that of us and we
   have an opportunity to come together."

   Earlier in the day, Majority (Democratic) Leader Tom Daschle of South
   Dakota said that last year's bipartisan passage of an education bill
   can serve as a model. "There have been many occasions when the
   Congress has come together to deal with critical issues, controversial
   issues in an election year. This year ought to be no different," he
   said.

   He repeated that view after the president's speech, declaring, "With a
   renewed commitment to compromise from both sides, I believe that we
   can put our economy back on track, win the war against terror and meet
   our nation's great unmet goals."

   Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (Republican, Illinois) pronounced
   Congress to be "committed to working with the president to eliminate
   terrorist threats against America."

   Representative Bob Stump (Republican, Arizona), chairman of the House
   Armed Services Committee, expressed pleasure that Bush "reminded all
   Americans that providing for our nation's defense is the federal
   government's number one priority."

   One of the sharpest responses came from Representative Pete Stark
   (Democrat, California), a strong advocate of expanded health care
   programs. He termed the president's Medicare prescription drug
   proposal "a cruel hoax on America's seniors," adding, "This empty
   promise without substantive funding is just cheap rhetoric -- a
   political ploy to make the president look like he cares about seniors
   and their health."

   Representative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, a member of the House
   Republican leadership, urged that Congress pledge to turn what he
   termed the president's "ambitious agenda" into reality during this
   year's session.

   But Senator Joseph Biden (Democrat, Delaware) was more reserved in his
   appraisal. "Tonight President Bush gave us a glimpse of what he
   proposes, and in a few days the budget will be released and the
   picture will become clearer," said the Senate Foreign Relations
   Committee chairman.

   "We will soon find out how the administration is going to fit all the
   things it hopes to implement -- the 10 pounds in their wish list --
   into the five pound bag" of available funds, he added.
