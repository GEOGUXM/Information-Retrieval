   Squadron 36 Patch Welcome to the CAP John J. Montgomery Memorial Cadet
   Squadron 36 webpage (whew!).  It is an infant page to the web, so it
   isn't much yet.  But don't worry - headway is already being made to add
   some cool features including the following: a calendar to tell you
   about upcoming events, a board for members to post messages, Squadron
   36 standard operating procedures, info about our members, and much
   more!  But before getting any further, you should probably know little
   about what CAP is and what it is about.  CAP is an acronym for Civil
   Air Patrol. It was founded on December 1, 1941, in order to help
   protect our coasts from invasions during World War II.  Civil Air
   Patrol is now a peaceful and benevolent organization with three
   purposes in mind:  to train America's youth to become leaders in
   today's society, to teach people about aerospace and the dynamics of
   flight, and to assist in Emergency Services (e.g. Search and Rescue,
   Disaster Relief, etc.)  But before I tell you too much, why don't you
   take a browse around our site and find out for yourself what CAP can do
   for you.
