   The International Visitor Program is administered by the U.S.
   Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs,
   operating under authority of the Mutual Educational and Cultural
   Exchange Act of 1961 (Fulbright-Hays Act). The emphasis of the program
   is to increase mutual understanding through communication at the
   personal and professional levels.

   The International Visitor Program brings participants to the United
   States from all over the world each year to meet and confer with their
   professional counterparts and to experience the United States
   firsthand. The visitors, who are current or potential leaders in
   government, politics, the media, education, and other fields, are
   selected by American Officials overseas. More than 200 current and
   former Heads of State, 1,500 cabinet-level ministers, and many other
   distinguished world leaders in government and the private sector have
   participated in the International Visitor Program.

   The U.S. Department of State directs the program in cooperation with a
   wide range of non-profit organizations operating under cooperative
   agreements with the U.S. Department of State. The program also relies
   on the commitment and skills of over 98 community-based organizations
   across the country. They represent a wide range of institutions and
   expertise from Unverisities to World Affairs Councils to all-volunteer.
   These organizations are known collectively as "Councils for
   International Visitors (CIVs)" associated under the umbrella
   organization of the National Council for International Visitors located
   in Washington, D.C.
