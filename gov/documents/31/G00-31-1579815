   The digital library research program at the Lister Hill National Center
   for Biomedical Communications investigates all aspects of creating and
   disseminating digital collections including proposed and adopted
   standards, emerging technologies and formats, effects on previously
   established processes, and protection of original materials.

   Our early experiments in document management and conversion resulted in
   a digital library system of historical materials from the 1960's and
   1970's. The Regional Medical Programs collection consists of
   approximately 40,000 pages comprising some 1,500 documents. Though the
   work on this system predated recent research in digital libraries, we
   addressed many of the same issues that currently face digital library
   projects.

   Working together with NLM's History of Medicine Division, we launched
   Profiles in Science in September 1998. The site uses innovative digital
   technology to make available the manuscript collections of prominent
   biomedical scientists of the 20th century. The collections have been
   donated to the NLM and contain published and unpublished materials,
   including books, journal volumes, pamphlets, diaries, letters,
   manuscripts, photographs, audio tapes and other audiovisual materials.
