Introduction

   The National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) is one of the national
   environmental data centers operated by the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce.
   The main NODC facility is located in Silver Spring, Maryland. The NODC
   also has field offices collocated with major government or academic
   oceanographic laboratories in Miami, FL; La Jolla, CA; Seattle, WA, and
   Honolulu, Hawaii.

   Besides the NODC, NOAA operates two other data centers:
   Item: National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), Asheville, North Carolina
       Item: National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), Boulder, Colorado

   Also, the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder,
   Colorado is operated for NGDC by the University of Colorado through the
   Cooperative Institute for Research on Environmental Sciences (CIRES).

   These discipline-oriented centers serve as national repositories and
   dissemination facilities for global environmental data. The data
   archives amassed by the NODC and the other centers provide a record of
   Earth's changing environment and support numerous research and
   operational applications. Working cooperatively, the centers provide
   data products and services to scientists, engineers, resource managers,
   policy makers, and other users in the United States and around the
   world.

NODC History and Mission

   Established in 1961, the NODC was originally an interagency facility
   administered by the U.S. Naval Hydrographic (later Oceanographic)
   Office. The NODC was transferred to NOAA in 1970 when NOAA was created
   by Executive Order. In the words of its charter, the NODC serves to
   "acquire, process, preserve, and disseminate oceanographic data." Its
   primary mission is to ensure that global oceanographic data collected
   at great cost is maintained in a permanent archive that is easily
   accessible to the world science community and to other users.

NODC Data Holdings

   The NODC holds physical, chemical, and biological oceanographic data
   collected by U.S. Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense
   (primarily the U.S. Navy); State, and local government agencies;
   universities and research institutions; and private industry. NODC does
   not conduct any data collection programs of its own; it serves solely
   as a repository and dissemination facility for data collected by
   others.

International Cooperation and Data Exchange

   A large percentage of the oceanographic data held by NODC is of foreign
   origin. NODC acquires foreign data through direct bilateral exchanges
   with other countries and through the facilities of World Data Center
   (WDC) for Oceanography, which is operated by NODC under the auspices of
   the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. There are three World Data
   Centers for Oceanography:
     * World Data Center, Silver Spring, Maryland, United States,
     * World Data Center, Moscow, Russia, and
     * World Data Center, Tianjin, People's Republic of China.

   They are part of the World Data Center System initiated in 1957 to
   provide a mechanism for data exchange during the International
   Geophysical Year. The World Data Center System operates under
   guidelines issued by the International Council of Scientific Unions
   (ICSU).

Data Management for Global Change Studies

   The NODC provides data management support for major ocean science
   projects such as TOGA (Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere), WOCE (World
   Ocean Circulation Experiment), and JGOFS (Joint Global Ocean Flux
   Study). To promote improved working relations with the academic ocean
   research community, the NODC established three joint centers with
   university research groups. The three centers are:
     * Joint Environmental Data Analysis Center
       (with Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California
       at San Diego)
     * Joint Archive for Sea Level (with the University of Hawaii)
     * Joint Center for Research in the Management of Ocean Data
       (with the University of Delaware)

Coastal Ocean Data Activities

   The NODC's global holdings of physical, chemical, and biological
   oceanographic data include substantial amounts of data from coastal
   ocean areas. For example, the NODC Oceanographic Profile Database holds
   parameter-depth products hold primarily coastal data. Coastal Ocean
   Data Workshop.

NOAA Library and Information Network

   The NODC also manages the NOAA Library and Information Network, which
   includes the NOAA Central Library in Silver Spring, MD; regional
   libraries in Miami, FL and Seattle, WA; and field libraries or
   information centers at about 30 NOAA sites throughout the United
   States. The combined libraries contain more than 1 million volumes,
   including books, journals, data and information CD-ROMs, and audio and
   video tapes.

Data Services

   Each year the NODC responds to thousands of requests for oceanographic
   data and information. Copies of specified data sets or data selected
   from the NODC's archive databases can be provided on magnetic media or
   on CD-ROM. Moderately-sized data sets can also be transmitted over
   computer networks via ftp. NODC data products are provided at prices
   that cover the cost of data selection and retrieval.
