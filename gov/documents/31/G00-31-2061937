           Measurements of the isotopic composition of atmospheric water
   vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere are a critical
   tool for diagnosing sources of upper tropospheric humidity and
   processes of troposphere-stratosphere exchange. Water vapor isotopic
   composition can be measured by remote sensing above this region, and by
   collection and laboratory mass spectrometry in the wetter air below it,
   but to date no measurements have been made in the region of maximum
   interest for transport questions. WISP (Water Isotope SPectrometer) is
   a three-channel tunable diode laser spectrometer designed for in-situ
   measurement of the isotopic composition of water vapor in the upper
   troposphere and lower stratosphere.   Simultaneous, independent
   measurements of H[2]O, HDO, H[2]^17O, H[2]^18O and CH[4] are made by
   scanning laser light at 1484 and 7299 cm^-1 (6.74 and 1.37 microns)
   over closely-spaced absorption features of the different gases. Laser
   light is injected into an open-path Herriott cell suspended beneath the
   aircraft wing, for a total pathlength of 94 meters;   mixing ratios are
   measured using second harmonic (2f) spectroscopy. The open-path
   arrangement minimizes problems of contamination by outgassing or
   adsorption of water on instrument surfaces. Methane, whose mixing ratio
   is relatively constant over local areas of the troposphere, serves as a
   proxy in-flight calibrator gas for tropospheric measurements, and
   provides a measure of "total hydrogen" (2*CH[4] + H[2]O) in the
   stratosphere.

           The baseline noise on WISP is expected to be approximately one
   part in 10^-5 absorption, providing an instrument sensitivity for
   delta^18O (the ratio of H[2]^18O to H[2]O, relative to a standard, in
   per mil units) of ~ 30 per mil, limited by systematic errors.
   Sensitivity for deltaD is expected to range from ~10 per mil in the
   troposphere to 45 per mil in the lower stratosphere, limited by loss of
   signal with altitude. Because many of the instrument systematic errors
   are common between all gases measured, instrument sensitivity for
   measurements of isotopic ratios is better than that for individual
   gases. Per mil sensitivities are calculated using assumed stratospheric
   isotopic composition.

           The instrument is designed for NASA's Wb57f aircraft, which
   carries atmospheric science payloads to altitudes up to 65,000 feet.
   WISP is making its first flights during the September 1999 ACCENT
   (Atmospheric Chemistry of Combustion Emissions Near the Tropopause)
   campaign, from Ellington Field in Houston, TX.
