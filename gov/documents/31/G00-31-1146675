   Robin J. Foulk
   District Conservationist
   Upper Niobrara White NRD

     1977 -- Graduated from Cottey College in Nevada, Missouri with
   Associate of Fine Arts Degree.

     1977/1978 -- Attended Montana State College.

     1980 -- Graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a
   Bachelor of Science Degree in Natural Resources, Soil Survey option.
   I began my career with NRCS in 1979 as a student trainee at the
   Holdrege, Nebraska Field Office. While attending UNL, I worked in the
   soil survey laboratory and water resource sections in the Nebraska
   State Office. During the next 20 years of my career with NRCS, I worked
   in Lexington, Nebraska and Grand Island, Nebraska as a soil
   conservationist. When the need arose, I detailed to Aurora, Osceola,
   and Central City. In 1983, I became the District Conservationist at
   Columbus, Nebraska and remained in that position for eight years. In
   May, 1991, I was selected to fill the District Conservationist position
   in Crawford, Nebraska. In August of 1992, the NRCS office was moved to
   Chadron for co-location.
   Resource Needs and Concerns
   A diversity of resource needs and concerns exist and have been
   identified by the Upper Niobrara White NRD Local Work Group. These
   concerns are listed in descending order of priority:
     * Noxious Weeds
     * Wind Erosion
     * Grazing Land, especially water distribution problems
     * Water Quality
     * Irrigation Water Management
     * Decreasing Groundwater Levels, primarily in Box Butte County
     * Wildlife Habitat
     * Stream Bank Erosion and Riparian Areas
     * Water Erosion
     * Overgrazing

   Priorities Addressed by NRCS
   NRCS is the primary source for technical expertise and assistance
   required to address environmental priorities. The staff is actively
   involved in providing technical assistance related to improvement of
   rangeland health, water quality, irrigation water management, wind and
   water erosion.
   Primary programs and services
   Many acres of the district are under federal or state management. Staff
   have a great opportunity to work with other groups and agencies. These
   include USDA Forest Service, Sugarloaf Grazing Association, Mirage
   Flats and Whitney Irrigation Districts, Bureau of Educational Lands &
   Funds (BELF), Nebraska Game and Parks, UNL Extension, Bureau of
   Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management, US Fish and Wildlife, Pheasants
   Forever, and Ducks Unlimited.
   NRCS utilizes the following programs on a routine basis to address the
   resource concerns and needs identified by the Upper Niobrara White NRD
   Local Work Group:
     * Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)
     * Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)
     * Nebraska Soil and Water Conservation Program (NSWCP)
     * Wetland Reserve Program (WRP)
     * NGPC Private Lands Wetlands Initiative Program
     * Federal or State Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP)
     * Nebraska Buffer Strip Program
     * Partners for Wildlife
     * Wildlife Shelterbelt Program
     * Corners for Wildlife
     * Pheasants Forever
     * Stewardship Incentive Program (SIP)
     * Forestry Incentive Program (FIP)
     * Nebraska Water Well Decommissioning Fund
     * Ground Water Monitoring
     * Duck Unlimited

   Utilization of Environmental Trust Fund (money generated through the
   Nebraska lottery) and grants under Nonpoint Source Management Projects
   to the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality for funding under
   Section 319 of the Federal Clean Water Act are also available for
   environmental improvement.
   A partnership was developed between the Bureau of Reclamation, Upper
   Niobrara White NRD, Mirage Flats Irrigation District, UNL Extension,
   and NRCS to provide irrigation scheduling and to implement a surge
   valve loaner program in the Mirage Flats Irrigation District.
   In 1997, EQIP dollars were approved for the Mirage Flats Irrigation
   Priority Area. The project area is approximately 16,000 acres. Mirage
   Flats is an area of relatively intensive irrigated crop production on
   porous soils. Irrigation water comes from both the District delivery
   system which includes a twelve mile canal originating from Box Butte
   Reservoir and numerous private irrigation wells. Major crops include
   corn, edible beans, alfalfa, and hay. The objective of this project is
   to reduce and prevent nutrients and other agricutural chemicals from
   reaching the Ogallala Aquifer. Best Management Practices include
   irrigation water management and herbicide use and application area as
   follows:
     * conservation cropping sequence
     * conservation tillage
     * crop residue
     * irrigation water management
     * integrated crop management
     * wildlife wetland habitat management
     * wildlife upland habitat management
     * record keeping
