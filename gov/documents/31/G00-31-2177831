Advanced Vehicle Technology Competitions

   Since 1987, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has sponsored 44
   different college and high school Advanced Vehicle Technology
   Competitions through Argonne. Argonne organizes and operates these
   competitions to

     * Accelerate the development and demonstration of technologies of
       interest to DOE and the automotive industry
     * Provide the automotive industry with a new generation of
       engineering leaders with highly desirable experience
     * Help prepare the market to accept advanced vehicle technologies.

   Focusing on engineering students at the graduate and undergraduate
   levels, these competitions target ultra-efficient vehicle designs,
   hybrid electric vehicles, and alternative-fuel vehicles for
   development, demonstration, and testing. They emphasize current or
   future vehicle technology; students work with production vehicles
   (donated by vehicle manufacturers) to improve their energy efficiency
   and to meet the toughest emissions standards while maintaining
   performance and functionality. Extensive data are collected to measure
   the real-world performance of advanced technologies and benchmark their
   developmental status.

   The competitions represent a unique coalition of government and
   industry aimed at eliminating technical and institutional barriers to
   acceptance of advanced vehicle technologies and alternative fuels. The
   competitions are highly valued and supported by automotive
   manufacturers, suppliers, fuel providers, and the educational
   community. Auto industry experts judge events, interact with students,
   and compare technologies. Federal funding for the competitions is
   heavily leveraged by industry contributions.

Results

   Conducting competitions provides significant technical, educational,
   and promotional benefits to DOE and the nation. More than 15,000
   student engineers from more than 235 schools from the United States,
   Canada, and Mexico have participated.

   The premier competition, FutureTruck, provides a way for engineering
   schools to participate in hands-on research and development with
   leading-edge automotive propulsion, fuels, materials, and emissions
   control technologies. The objectives of the competition are to explore
   and refine production-feasible advanced propulsion technologies that
   improve the efficiency of sport utility vehicles. At the same time,
   hundreds of the country's best young engineers are gaining invaluable
   experience developing and implementing the latest automotive
   technologies.

   Several innovations and ongoing research projects have resulted from
   the competitions. Examples include the following:
     * In FutureTruck 2000, a 13% improvement was attained in on-road fuel
       efficiency (MPGE), and a 26% reduction was attained in greenhouse
       gas emissions, compared to the stock Chevrolet Suburban
     * In Ethanol Vehicle Challenge 2000, the winning vehicle in the
       emissions event (University of Illinois at Chicago) met the
       California Air Resources Board ultra-low emissions vehicle standard
       - one of the toughest in the world.
     * Northwestern University developed a gas quality sensor, Old
       Dominion University developed a gaseous fuel injector that is now
       an OEM component, and other teams developed several complex
       emission-control systems.
     * Four universities were awarded $1.2 million in research grants on
       the basis of their competition experience.
     * Three university hybrid electric vehicles were used to help
       validate the draft Society of Automotive Engineers Hybrid Electric
       Vehicle Emissions Procedures.
     * More than 250 student papers and over 20 Argonne technical papers
       have been published.

Future Plans

   The competitions continue to grow in sophistication and complexity. New
   competitions based on ethanol reformation to hydrogen for use in fuel
   cell vehicles are under discussion. Both Ford and General Motors have
   made a commitment to long-term support for these competitions on the
   basis of their benefits in technology development and demonstration.
