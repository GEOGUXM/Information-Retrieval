   We have prepared an AVI movie file that demonstrates the functionality
       of the Scoreboard tool. Click here to view the movie (29.1 MB).
   To use a demonstration version of the Scoreboard tool, please click the
                                 link below.
   You will then prompted for login information. Please select one of the
            following individuals to use for your demonstration:

 Username: Joe Demo
Password: demouser99

                     Username: Jill Demo
                    Password: demouser99

                                         Username: John Demo
                                        Password: demouser99

                                                             Username: Jane Demo
                                                            Password: demouser99

      All of the users will have the same functionality. If you want to
     experience the Scoreboard with one or more of your colleagues/team
     members, you should each select a different demonstration identity.
                            Enter the Scoreboard.
