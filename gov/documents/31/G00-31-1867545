   On September 22, 2001, the 107th Congress enacted  Public Law 107-42,
   the "AIR TRANSPORTATION SAFETY AND SYSTEM STABILIZATION ACT." In
   addition to requiring the President to compensate the air carriers for
   losses incurred as a result of the September 11th attacks, the Act
   establishes the "September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001."

   On November 26, the Attorney General named Kenneth Feinberg as Special
   Master to administer the program. The Interim Final Rule that will
   govern administration of the program and the Special Master's Presumed
   Loss Calculation Tables Before any Collateral Offsets have now been
   published on this site.

   This site also provides the form and instructions for submitting an
   Eligibility Form (required for all claims) and an optional Application
   for Advance Benefits from the Victim Compensation Fund. The same form
   fulfills both of these actions. When finalized, the Death or Personal
   Injury Compensation Forms to be used in submitting a compensation claim
   other than for advance benefits will be published on this site. (Please
   see the overview of the claims process flow chart.) Also available on
   this site is a List of Victim Representatives Making Claims.

   The comment period on the Interim Final Rule implementing Public Law
   107-42 ended midnight January 22, 2002. You may still submit comments
   for later consideration as appropriate.
