       Secretary Reed and County Auditors to Energize Washington Youth

   NEWS RELEASE
   Issued: January 14, 2002
      Contact: Trova Hutchins
      (360) 902-4140
      OLYMPIAWashington Secretary of State Sam Reed and County Auditors today
      expanded his nationally recognized Voting is Cool! program to
      creatively teach young people about democracy.
      In the 2001 General Election, the number of registered 18-24 year olds
      who turned out to vote averaged just 14% in some Washington counties.
      (For turnout in certain counties, see below.) In the year 2000, turnout
      for the same group is estimated at roughly 30%. Like the rest of
      America, Washington struggles attracting young people to the polls
      because they are mobile and beginning new challenges.
      To instill a sense of patriotism among young people, Secretary Reed and
      County Auditors launched the second phase of the Voting is Cool!
      program today which includes a website
      (www.secstate.wa.gov/votingiscool) and the following five ready-made
      lesson plans geared toward fifth-grade students:
        * The relevance of voting to young peoples daily lives
        * Running for office and campaigning
        * The voting process
        * One vote makes a difference
        * Making a difference in our democracy

      The curriculum is the heart of our youth vote campaign, said Reed. You
      cant instill values in todays youth overnight. The hard work and the
      credit fall to County Auditors and educators who help make the
      transformation in classrooms throughout the state.
      Reed first launched Voting is Cool! last fall when he traveled to five
      Washington high schools with youth role models. The Take Pride in
      America and Vote campaign was designed to discuss the importance of
      democracy during one of our countrys most troubling times.
      We must never downplay or tire of educating young people about
      democracy and its relevance to their lives, said Reed. Who in the
      electorate is more important? Young people deserve an equal say in
      their elected leaders, and they are the foundation of the future of
      Washington.
