      Accessing outside machines from LANL
        * ssh  is preferred,  use scp to copy files from external sites
          e.g.,  scp 'otherhost:otherdir/files.*' localdir
        * Telnet is available to outside machines
        * It is also possible to use ftp through portal. For general
          instructions, see the LANL help page.

      Accessing T16 machines from external sites
        * ssh is required, along with a smartcard. You must go through
          portal.lanl.gov and from there to one of the local machines. Note
          we run version 1 of the protocol.

   Sun Documentation

     Programming and Languages, including Fortran, C, C++, Performance
   Library, etc.

     Desktop, including Solaris 2.6, Solaris 7 answerbooks, Common Desktop
   Environment, etc.

Compilers/Languages

   Fortran
     * Sun Workshop (including f77/f90/c/c++, debuggers, etc.) info
     * Fortran: Sun f77/f90 compiler and debugger; type 'man f77' or 'man
       f90' or 'man workshop' for help, respectively.
     * Fortran 90: Fujitsu F90 compiler, debugger, etc.; type 'man frt',
       'man fdb', or 'man workbench' for help. Note that frt compiles f90
       or f77 codes. fdb is a terminal-mode debugger, the screen-oriented
       version is available as xfd or through workbench.  Timing tools are
       available as samp or xsamp.

   C/C++
     * Sun C/C++: (cc/CC) See sun workshop info
     * C: Gnu c compiler and debugger; type 'man gcc' for help. 'gdb' is
       the Gnu debugger. Help for Gnu products is also available via
       'info'.
     * C++: Gnu c++ compiler and debugger; type 'man g++' for help. 'gdb'
       is the Gnu debugger. Help for Gnu products is also available via
       'info'.

   Other:
     * Perl: a very useful scripting language; type 'man perl' for help.
       The  Tk perl module is also available.
     * Tcl: another scripting language; type 'man Tcl' for help.
     * Tk: a window creation/manipulation language; type 'man wish' for
       help.

Libraries (netlib is a good source of other libraries)

     * BLAS: different versions are available, all in /opt/local/lib

     * blas - same as blasf77 below
     * blasf77 - f77 compiler, standard precision
     * blasf77_r8 - f77 compiler, double precision, double aligned (-r8
       -dalign -O4)
     * blas_frt - frt (Fujitsu) compiler, standard precision (-Fixed -X7
       -O2 -Kdalign -Kunroll=4 -KULTRA)
     * blas_frt_r8 - frt (Fujitsu) compiler, double precision

     SUNPERF: sun version of blas, slatec, etc. in
   /opt/local/sun/SUNWspro/lib
   This library should be faster than the others, though no -r8 version is
   available. Use -xlic_lib=sunperf on the command line.
     * sunperf, standard precision

     LAPACK: A general purpose linear algebra package (f77)
     * lapack - f77 compiler, use -L/opt/local/lib -llapack -lblas
     * lapack_frt - fujitsu compiler, use -L/opt/local/lib -llapack_frt
       -lblas_frt
     * lapack_fuj_r8 - fujitsu compiler, with double precision option, use
       -L/opt/local/lib -llapack_fuj_r8 -lblas_frt_r8

     SLATEC: in /opt/local/lib/slatec - same as slatecf77 below
     * slatecf77 - f77 compiler, standard precision, double aligned
       (-dalign -O4)
     * slatecf77_r8 - f77 compiler, double precision, double aligned (-r8
       -dalign -O4)
     * slatec_frt - frt compiler, double precision, double aligned (-Fixed
       -X7 -O2 -Kdalign -Kunroll=4 -KULTRA, except psifn.f had to be
       compiled -g to pass tests

Plotting Packages

     * XY-Plotting: xvgr Manual or xmgr (a newer motif version of xmgr)
       Manual
     * 2- or 3-D Plotting: gnuplot Quick Reference or Manual

Drawing Packages

     * xfig:  simple drawing program, can import postscript (eps), etc.
       Help is available within the application
     * IslandDraw:  (old) drawing program

Text Packages

     * teTeX version of Tex and Latex
     * Star Office:  Text Processor, drawing program, presentation
       program, spreadsheet, etc. Claims to be able import Microsoft Word
       files.
     * IslandDraw:  (old) drawing program

Symbolic Manipulation

     * Maple: Algebraic manipulation and some graphics, invoke as 'maple'
       for terminal interface or 'xmaple' for x-windows version.
     * Mathematica: similar to maple  ('math' or 'mathematica' for
       x-windows version)

WWW Browsers

     * mosaic: ancient NCSA browser
     * netscape: (old version available as netscape-old)

System Info

     * proctool: shows information about system status and processes
