                           Metal Industry Indicators

   The Metal Industry Indicators (MII) is a monthly newsletter that
   analyzes and forecasts the economic health of five metal industries:
   primary metals, steel, copper, primary aluminum, and aluminum mill
   products. Composite leading and coincident indexes were developed under
   a cooperative agreement with the former Center for International
   Business Cycle Research (CIBCR) at Columbia University. The composite
   leading and coincident indexes are constructed with a set of indicators
   that historically have proven to lead or coincide with the major
   changes in these industries. Each month, these indexes are analyzed
   along with any economy-wide occurrences that would affect the metals
   industries. To view or print a document in PDF format, download the
   free Adobe Acrobat Reader. The MII publication series also is available
   by fax and in print. Historical data for the MII indexes are usually
   updated the third Friday of each month. The latest file of historical
   data was updated on January 18 and contains revised indexes that will
   appear in the January 2002 MII.
   A summary report of the MII that has previously been only on Mines
   FaxBack is now available on the internet. Note:
   The USGS has prepared leading and coincident indexes for the Stone,
   Clay, Glass, and Concrete Products Industry (SIC 32). These indexes are
   similar to the ones in Metal Industry Indicators. The latest report for
   these indexes, December 2001, is available in PDF format.
