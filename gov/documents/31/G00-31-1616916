   Exploring the Frontiers of Burning Science Dale Meade and the FIRE Team
   ITC-12 / APFA '01 Meeting December 14, 2001 Toki, Japan
   http://fire.pppl.gov Is an Opportunity Emerging for Fusion in the U.
   S.? Secretary of Energy  Abraham - DOE Mission and Priorities  Oct. 24,
   2001 (to DOE Lab Directors and DOE) "I would add to this list two
   priorities that deserve special mention. The first involves the unique
   technological contribution we can make to our energy and national
   security by finding new sources of energy. Whether it is fusion or a
   hydrogen economy, or ideas that we have not yet explored, I believe we
   need to leapfrog the status quo and prepare for a future that, under
   any scenario, requires a revolution in how we find, produce and deliver
   energy." "I intend, therefore, that this Department take a leadership
   role in exploring how we can identify and use potentially abundant new
   sources of energy with dramatic environmental benefits." Federal
   Reserve Chairman Greenspan - On Energy Supply  Nov. 13, 2001 (Rice
   University) "In the more distant future remains the potential of fusion
   power. A significant breakthrough in this area has been sought for
   years but seems discouragingly beyond reach. But success could provide
   a major contribution to our nation's future power needs. The input
   costs of fusion power would be minor, and it produces negligible
   nuclear waste or pollutants." What should we do to be ready? Activities
   in the U. S. to Assess Next Steps in MFE * House of Representatives
   passed the Energy Authorization Bill (HR 4) on August 1, 2001. The U.
   S. Senate has prepared a similar bill regarding fusion. 1. Calls for
   strengthening the base fusion sciences program 2. Directs DOE to submit
   a plan for construction of a U.S. Burning Plasma Experiment to Congress
   by July 2004. In addition, DOE may also develop a plan for United
   States participation in an international burning plasma experiment for
   the same purpose, if it's construction is highly likely and cost
   effective for the U. S. relative to a domestic experiment. * Fusion
   Energy Sciences Advisory Committee (FESAC) endorses recommendations of
   FESAC Burning Plasma Panel. * National Research Council is preparing a
   proposal to review burning plasma physics as required by HR 4 and
   recommended by FESAC. * Preparations are beginning for a Snowmass
   Summer Study 2002 that will emphasize burning plasmas. International
   participation is encouraged. Full text on http://fire.pppl.gov Fusion
   Frontiers to be Explored by the Next Stage of Fusion Research * Burning
   Plasma Physics - strong nonlinear coupling inherent in a fusion
   dominated plasma - access, explore and understand fusion dominated
   plasmas * Advanced Toroidal Physics - develop and test physics needed
   for an attractive MFE reactor - couple with burning plasma physics *
   Boundary Physics and Plasma Technology (coupled with above) - high
   particle and heat flux - couple core and divertor - fusion plasma -
   tritium inventory and helium pumping * Neutron Resistant Materials
   (separate facility) - high fluence testing using " point" neutron
   source * Superconducting Coil Technology does not have to be coupled to
   physics experiments - only if needed for physics objectives * Nuclear
   Component Testing should wait for the correct reactor materials The

   We should be ready. The Modular or Multi-Machine Strategy has
   advantages for addressing the science and technolgy issues of fusion. *
   A compact high field tokamak, like FIRE, has the potential: * address
   the important burning plasma issues, * investigate the strong
   non-linear coupling between BP and AT, * stimulate the development of
   reactor relevant PFC technology, and * Some areas that need additional
   work to realize this potential include: * Apply recent enhanced
   confinement and advanced modes to FIRE * Understand conditions for
   enhanced confinement regimes * Compare DN relative to SN - confinement,
   stability, divertor, etc * Complete disruption analysis, develop better
   disruption control/mitigation. * Respond to FIRE Engineering Review and
   NSO PAC on specific physics R&D and engineering design and R&D issues.
