   NOAA's interest in aquatic environments includes the land areas that
   drain into rivers, known as watersheds, as well as the rivers
   themselves. Because aquatic ecosystems are affected by so many
   different characteristics of the watershed, impact assessment and
   management can be significantly improved by using a method that shows
   the geographic relationship between measurements taken at specific
   places and the characteristics specific to that region.

   NOAA's Coastal Protection and Restoration Division (CPRD) has developed
   an integrated assessment tool that combines a computer database and
   database-mapping programs. This approach allows scientists to analyze a
   variety of data (such as sediment contaminant concentrations, tissue
   data, aquatic species occurrence, and habitat characteristics) in
   combination with a watershed's features and land uses. This information
   is displayed on maps at various spatial scales, simplifying data
   presentation and improving our understanding of dynamic aquatic
   ecosystems.
   Query Manager^TM Download this application to access sediment
   chemistry, sediment toxicity, and tissue chemistry data from specific
   watershed projects.  By downloading the associated program MARPLOT
   queried information then can be displayed on maps.

   to study watersheds and to create maps with data types such as sediment
   toxicity, fish surveys, land use, and aerial photographs.
