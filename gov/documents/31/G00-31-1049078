   Electronic filing has many advantages over filing on paper via mail or
   express delivery services, including:
     * a dramatic increase in the speed with which applications can be
       filed;
     * the ability to file 24 hours a day, seven days a week, making it
       possible to receive a filing date 1) on days the Office is
       officially closed; and 2) extending the time for filing on any
       given day up until midnight Eastern Standard Time, rather than an
       earlier time (often 5 p.m.) - which is the case using the U.S.
       Postal Service Express Mail certificate procedure;
     * virtually instantaneous provision of filing receipt and serial
       number;
     * flexibility in payment options- either credit card, deposit account
       or (after October 2001), Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or
       E-Check;
     * saving a great deal of money on Express Mail postage and fax
       charges and/or courier delivery costs, because electronic
       applications are created, reviewed and filed electronically using
       the internet;
     * more accurate filing receipt information because it is transferred
       directly from the database containing the information entered by
       the applicant and does not have to be entered again manually at the
       USPTO;
     * more efficient review of the applications because they are in a
       standard format recommended by the USPTO; and faster review of
       applications by an examining attorney or paralegal.
