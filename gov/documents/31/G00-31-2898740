   The Credit Insurance Agent License was established in AB 393 (Scott,
   Chapter 321, Statutes of 2000)*.

   A Credit Insurance Agent License permits a business to sell credit
   insurance, and receive a commission, without (as in previous years)
   having to be licensed as a life agent and/or property and casualty
   broker-agent. The California Department of Insurance is now accepting
   applications for the credit insurance license and will commence issuing
   the licenses on January 1, 2002.

   With a Credit Insurance Agent License, a business may register its
   employees who solicit or sell credit insurance to be listed as
   "endorsees." A business will have to register its employees as
   endorsees if it will pay or permit them to receive commissions for the
   selling of credit insurance, but will not have to register its
   employees as endorsees if it will not pay or permit them to receive
   commissions for selling credit insurance.

   The How Can I Get A License? page provides instructions and the
   necessary forms to apply for a Credit Insurance Agent License and how
   to register endorsees.

   With the Credit Insurance Agent License becoming effective on January
   1, 2002, a business interested in obtaining this license will need to
   apply as soon as possible.  Thank you!
