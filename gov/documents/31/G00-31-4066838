   The main objective of this activity is to transfer to industry and the
   public the experience gained, technology developed, and lessons learned
   from the DOE Hydropower Program.
   Technology Transfer Activities
   The general activities during the last two years are as follows:
     * Published reports and articles on the active projects
     * Published a Biennial Program Status Report (much of this web site
       uses material from the report)
     * Reviewed unsolicited proposals and new concepts
     * Responded to inquiries and issued information and data upon request
     * Monitored the environmental, technology, and regulatory issues and
       the status of the industry
     * Supported and participated in the hydropower industry's
       conferences, workshops, and public education activities.
