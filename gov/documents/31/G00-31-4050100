                         Frequently asked questions

   FMC staff has compiled frequently asked questions and answers regarding
   the new rules implementing OSRA and how they will be administered. Most
   of these questions have been posed to staff via telephone inquiries.
   The answers are reproduced here not as official or formal Commission
   interpretations, but rather as commonly issued informal staff advice
   regarding what is in the rules which have been promulgated (and which
   are also available on this website).
