   Adobe software converts a document created in any word processing
   software to a portable document format (pdf). This allows the document
   to be transported to the Court or others without losing any unique
   formatting features of the document. In addition, the recipient only
   needs Adobe Reader software to read the document. Adobe Acrobat Reader
   is available free on the Internet.
