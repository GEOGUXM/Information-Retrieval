   ARGUED FEBRUARY 26 & 27, 2001, DECIDED JUNE 28, 2001 IN THE UNITED
   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT No.
   00-5212 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. MICROSOFT
   CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellant Consolidated with No. 00-5213
   APPELLEES' RESPONSE TO MICROSOFT'S MOTION FOR STAY OF THE MANDATE
   PENDING PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI Microsoft requests a stay of
   this Court's mandate pending disposition of its petition for
   certiorari. By its terms, Microsoft's petition seeks interlocutory
   review of a highly fact-based determination that the Supreme Court has
   said a court of appeals is in the best position to make. Under the
   circumstances, Microsoft has little prospect of obtaining certiorari
   review, let alone winning a reversal, of this Court's unanimous, en
   banc judgment. Moreover, there is no sense in which resumption of
   proceedings before the district court would injure Microsoft in any
   way. By contrast, granting a stay would further delay the public's
   remedy and contribute to uncertainty in the market. Microsoft therefore
   has not met any of the requirements for a stay. Accordingly, this Court
   should deny Microsoft's request and issue its mandate immediately. To
   merit a stay, Microsoft "must show that the certiorari petition would
   present a substantial question and that there is good cause for a
   stay." Fed. R. App. P. 41(d)(2)(A); D.C. Cir. R. 41(a)(2). More
   specifically, Microsoft must demonstrate: (1) a reasonable probability
   that four Justices would vote to grant certiorari; (2) a significant
   possibility that the Court would reverse the judgment below; and (3) a
   likelihood of irreparable harm, assuming the correctness of the
   applicant's position, if the judgment is not stayed. Packwood v. Senate
   Select Comm. on Ethics, 510 U.S. 1319, 1319 (Rehnquist, Circuit Justice
   1994); South Park Indep. School Dist. v. United States, 453 U.S. 1301,
   1303 (Powell, Circuit Justice 1981). See also ROBERT L. STERN, ET AL.,
   SUPREME COURT PRACTICE § 17.19, at 689 (7th ed. 1993) (lower courts
   apply same factors). Thus, Microsoft's claim that it may obtain a stay
   by demonstrating "either" certworthiness or irreparable injury (Mot. 3)
   is not only incorrect1- but also irrelevant, because Microsoft
   demonstrates neither. In addition, the balance of equities strongly
   favors denial of the stay. 1. This Court's judgment is interlocutory.
   That fact "of itself alone furnishe[s] sufficient ground for the
   denial" of Microsoft's petition for certiorari. Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co.
   v. Wolf Bros. & Co., 240 U.S. 251, 258 (1916); see also Brotherhood of
   Locomotive Firemen v. Bangor In Books v. City of Elkhart, 239 F.3d 826
   (7th Cir. 2001) (Ripple, J., in chambers) (Mot. 3), the parties agreed
   that a stay ought to be granted. Id. at 828. And Microsoft overreads
   Deering Milliken, Inc. v. FTC, 647 F.2d 1124 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (Mot. 3).
   That case was decided prior to the 1994 amendment to Rule 41 that added
   the requirement that a stay motion "must show that the certiorari
   petition would present a substantial question and that there is good
   cause for a stay." Fed. R. App. P. 41(d)(2)(A) (emphasis added). Even
   without that requirement in the Rule, the Deering court did not say
   that only one of those elements was required, and it both found the
   issues presented to be substantial, 647 F.2d at 1128, and concluded
   that "the balance of the equities" favored continuing the existing stay
   of the district court's orders-which had the same effect as staying the
   mandate. Id. at 1129. Cf. Lincoln Tel. & Tel. Co. v. FCC, 659 F.2d
   1092, 1110 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (per curiam). -2- & Aroostook R.R.. Co.,
   389 U.S. 327, 328 (1967) ("because the Court of Appeals remanded the
   case, it is not yet ripe for review by this Court"); Virginia Military
   Inst. v. United States, 508 U.S. 946 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring)
   ("We generally await final judgment in the lower courts before
   exercising our certiorari jurisdiction"); STERN, ET AL. § 4.18, at 196.
   Microsoft argues that, despite the judgment's interlocutory status, the
   question of the scope of the district judge's disqualification is ripe
   for Supreme Court review. Pet. 15. But Microsoft itself foreshadows the
   likelihood that it will later petition for certiorari to review other
   aspects of this Court's decision. Pet. 15. Thus, it virtually promises
   that a grant of certiorari now would lead to multiple, piecemeal
   appeals-precisely the result the Supreme Court policy disfavoring
   interlocutory appeals is designed to avoid. Cf. Cobbledick v. United
   States, 309 U.S. 323, 326 (1940). The Supreme Court likely will avert
   that result by denying certiorari now. 2. This Court's decision was
   entirely consistent with Supreme Court authority and that of its sister
   circuits. Microsoft argues that this Court required a showing of actual
   bias to vacate the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and that
   that requirement conflicts with Supreme Court authority and decisions
   of other circuits. But the claimed conflicts are based wholly on
   demonstrable misreadings of this Court's decision and the other
   decisions Microsoft cites. a. Contrary to Microsoft's assertions, this
   Court did not require "a showing of actual bias to obtain
   disqualification under 28 U.S.C. § 455(a)." Mot. 6. Indeed, though the
   Court found no actual bias (Slip Op. 122), it nevertheless did
   disqualify the trial judge-both prospectively and retroactively-because
   of the appearance of bias. Id. at 121. Rather than holding that "actual
   bias" is a requirement for disqualification, the Court quite properly
   considered -3- it as merely one factor in guiding its discretion as to
   the remedy for the district judge's violation of § 455(a). Id. at 122.
   b. Next, Microsoft misreads Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition
   Corp., 486 U.S. 847 (1988), in two ways. First, it studiously avoids
   the Supreme Court's key holding: [T]he Court of Appeals is in a better
   position to evaluate the significance of a violation [of § 455(a)] than
   is this Court. Its judgment as to the proper remedy should thus be
   afforded our due consideration. Id. at 862. The statute "neither
   prescribes nor prohibits any particular remedy for a violation." Id.
   Second, and accordingly, the Supreme Court did not "require[] that a
   final judgment . . . be vacated and the case retried" (Mot. 4), but
   held merely that the court of appeals' "determination that a new trial
   is in order is well supported." 486 U.S. at 862. Liljeberg does require
   a court of appeals to weigh three factors when fashioning a remedy for
   violations of § 455(a). Id. at 864. This Court did just that (Slip Op.
   121-22), and in so doing, soundly exercised its discretion. The Court's
   prospective and partial retroactive disqualification, and vacation of
   the remedy order, was a stern response to serious misconduct. It also
   collaterally penalized plaintiffs, "who were innocent and unaware of
   the misconduct" (id. at 122), by delaying remedy proceedings until a
   new judge is assigned and becomes familiar with the case. There was no
   evidence that Microsoft's "right to an impartial adjudication" on
   liability was compromised, no allegation or evidence that the judge's
   conduct "rose to the level of actual bias or prejudice," and no
   suggestion that plaintiffs were aware before Microsoft of the judge's
   misconduct. Id. at 122. The Court also took upon itself-because
   Microsoft challenged almost none of the district court's findings
   (id.)-to review "the record with painstaking care and . . . discerned
   no evidence of actual bias." Id. at 124. This Court's unanimous, en
   banc exercise of its discretion was -4- considered, deliberate,
   thorough, and reasonable. There is no reason to suppose the Supreme
   Court will disturb it, or even choose to review it. c. Nothing in this
   Court's decision conflicts with Preston v. United States, 923 F.2d 731
   (9th Cir. 1991), or United States v. Cooley, 1 F.3d 985 (10th Cir.
   1993), contrary to Microsoft's contention (Mot. 2). Neither case even
   purports to establish or apply a legal standard that differs from the
   standard this Court applied. In Preston, the court of appeals found a
   violation of § 455(a) in a wrongful death suit because when the
   litigation began, the district judge was of counsel to the law firm
   representing the decedent's employer. 923 F.2d at 734. Thus, unlike
   here, the conduct giving rise to the § 455(a) violation occurred before
   the district judge even began his proceedings. In exercising its
   discretion under Liljeberg, the Preston court determined that "[t]here
   is no way . . . to purge the perception of partiality in this case
   other than to vacate the judgment and remand the case to the district
   court for retrial by a different judge." Id. at 735 (emphasis added).
   By contrast, here the misconduct arose from the judge's reaction to the
   evidence presented in the case itself and did not implicate any
   preexisting basis to doubt the judge's impartiality. In Cooley, the
   court reversed a criminal conviction because the judge had appeared on
   a "Nightline" broadcast and stated that various abortion protesters are
   "breaking the law" by violating his earlier-issued injunction 1 F.3d at
   990-91. This was a violation of § 455(a). Id. at 995. As in Preston,
   the conduct creating the § 455(a) violation occurred before the
   defendants even appeared in district court. In remedying the § 455
   violation, the court of appeals cited Liljeberg and summarily stated
   that it was "satisfied that the remedy in this case is to vacate the
   conviction and sentence" of each defendant. Id. at 998 (emphasis
   added). -5- Both Preston and Cooley thus reflect what the courts
   deciding them thought to be appropriate remedies in the exercise of
   their discretion, given the facts and circumstances of those two cases.
   Neither case suggests a legal standard that would require vacatur in
   every case where an appearance of bias was found, and nothing in either
   case bears upon what would be an appropriate remedy here. As this Court
   recognized (Slip Op. 121-22), there are other cases involving
   violations of § 455 in which courts have determined, as this Court did,
   that vacatur was not required. See In re School Asbestos Litigation,
   977 F.2d 764, 787-88 (3d Cir. 1992); In re Allied Signal Inc., 891 F.2d
   974, 975-76 (1st Cir. 1989) (Breyer, J.). Microsoft's motion mentions
   neither of these decisions, nor the relevant decisions in United States
   v. Cerceda, 172 F.3d 806, 812-17 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (per
   curiam) (refusing to vacate sentences or underlying convictions); or
   United States v. Jordan, 49 F.3d 152, 158-59 (5th Cir. 1995) (vacating
   sentence but not underlying conviction). 3. Microsoft makes no serious
   claim that issuance of the mandate now will cause it irreparable
   injury. See Mot. 6 (claiming vague "threat of severe and unnecessary
   injury"). This omission in itself justifies denial of a stay. See
   Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 463 U.S. 1315, 1317 (Blackmun, Circuit
   Justice 1983). Nor could Microsoft demonstrate irreparable injury.
   Issuing the mandate would merely allow remand proceedings to begin.
   There is no pending remedial judgment or decree to enforce that would
   alter Microsoft's business while its petition for certiorari is
   considered, and its petition will almost certainly be resolved before
   any new remedial order is actually entered by the District Court. Thus,
   the only injury to Microsoft would be the cost of participating in the
   remand proceedings, but "`[m]ere litigation expense, even substantial
   and unrecoupable cost, does not constitute irreparable injury.'" Ticor
   Title Ins. Co. v. FTC, 814 -6- F.2d 731, 740 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (quoting
   Renegotiation Bd. v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 24 (1974));
   McSurely v. McClellan, 697 F.2d 309, 317 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1982). 4.
   Finally, "[i]t is ultimately necessary . . . `to "balance the
   equities"-to explore the relative harms to applicant and respondent, as
   well as the interests of the public at large.'" Barnes v. E-Systems,
   Inc., 501 U.S. 1301, 1304-05 (Scalia, Circuit Justice 1991) (internal
   citations omitted). Here, the balance of equities tilts decidedly in
   favor of appellees. Microsoft offers no equities in its favor (Mot.
   6-7), no injury it will suffer from the resumption of proceedings. By
   contrast, granting the stay will further hurt the public interest in
   competition and create uncertainty in the market. Microsoft has been
   found to have committed serious violations of Section 2 of the Sherman
   Act through conduct that began in 1995, yet those violations remain
   unremedied. This Court repeatedly emphasized that rapid technological
   change has occurred and continues to occur in this market. Slip Op. 10,
   37, 61, 83. Microsoft and other market participants continue to develop
   and introduce new products. Indeed, Microsoft has announced that it
   will soon introduce Windows XP, the next generation of its monopoly
   operating system. Because of its monopoly position, Microsoft's
   products and conduct overhang the market. The sooner remedial
   proceedings begin, the sooner a resolution can be crafted to assure
   competitive conditions and give industry participants the certainty
   they need to plan or commit resources efficiently. Until that remedy is
   in place, each day of delay contributes additional injury to the public
   interest in competition. See California v. American Stores Co., 492
   U.S. 1301, 1304 (O'Connor, Circuit Justice 1989) (staying merger in
   part because "lessening of competition `is precisely the kind of
   irreparable injury that injunctive relief . . . was intended to
   prevent'") (citation omitted); -7- Marathon Oil Co. v. Mobil Corp., 669
   F.2d 384, 385 (6th Cir. 1982) (denying stay where court's "prime
   concern is the preservation of some competition in this market").
   Issuing the mandate now would end that delay so that a new trial judge
   can be assigned, become familiar with the record, meet with the
   parties, and issue a discovery and scheduling order to govern remand
   proceedings. Such actions could all occur while not imposing
   irreparable injury on Microsoft before the Supreme Court can act.
   Microsoft's liability has already been adjudicated and affirmed. This
   Court should deny Microsoft's request for a stay so that remand
   proceedings before a new judge can begin now. -8- CONCLUSION
   Microsoft's Motion For Stay Of The Mandate Pending Petition For Writ Of
   Certiorari should be denied. Respectfully submitted. ELIOT SPITZER
