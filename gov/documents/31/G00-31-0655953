                  Countdown to GLAS Launch - December, 2001

     GLAS (the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) will be launched aboard
   the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) into a near-polar
   orbit (inclination 94 degrees) in late 2001. GLAS is part of NASA's
   Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) which includes a series of satellites
   beginning in 1999 to measure Earth's atmosphere, oceans, land, ice, and
   biosphere for a period of 10 to 15 years. The main goal of ESE is to
   measure changes in the earth-atmosphere system which are indicative of
   climate and environmental change.
     GLAS will be the first atmospheric backscatter lidar to make
   continuous measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from space. The lidar
   will provide unprecedented views of atmospheric cloud and aerosol
   structure and give us information on the height and thickness of
   radiatively important cloud layers which is needed for accurate short
   term climate and weather prediction.
