                         Gifts from Outside Sources

   [grad_blu.gif]

   The Standards of Conduct for Executive Branch Employees state that an
   employee, whether on or off duty, may not solicit or accept, directly
   or indirectly, any gift, favor, gratuity, entertainment, or loan,
   regardless of value, from a prohibited source, nor may an employee
   accept a gift, or thing of value, given bcause of the employee's
   official position. The following definitions will clarify what is
   considered a gift, and from whom gifts are allowable. The exceptions to
   the gift acceptance prohibition are also described below.

   Definitions
     * A gift is a gratuity, favor, discount, entertainment, hospitality,
       loan, forbearance, or other item having monetary value. It includes
       gifts of transportation, local travel, and lodgings and meals.
       These travel related gifts are covered whether provided in-kind
       (that is, the donor just gives you a plane ticket, or hotel room
       key), payment in advance, or reimbursement after the expense has
       been incurred.
     * A gift is NOT:
          + Food or refreshment which is not in conjunction with a meal,
            such as coffee, donuts, punch and cookies - in other words,
            snacks, are not considered gifts.
          + Greeting cards and items of little intrinsic value (e.g.,
            plaques, certificates and trophies which are solely for
            presentation.)
          + Rewards and prizes given in contests which are open to the
            public or to a broadly defined class of government employees.
          + Loans from banks and other financial institutions at rates
            available to the general public.
          + Opportunities and benefits generally available to the public,
            or to all government employees.
          + Anything that the government pays for, or anything for which
            you pay the fair market price.

     * A PROHIBITED SOURCE may be:
          + Any person, or entity, who has, or is SEEKING to do business
            with the NIH, or is seeking official action by the NIH,
          + Anyone who conducts operations which are REGULATED by the NIH,
          + Anyone with interests which may be substantially affected by
            the performance or non-performance of an employee's OFFICIAL
            DUTIES, or,
          + Any professional, technical or trade association, the majority
            of whose members represent prohibited sources.

   Exceptions

   The gift acceptance prohibition does have a few limited exceptions
   which apply to most employees.
     * Gifts of $20 or less per occasion, may be accepted from a single
       source. However, you may not accept more than $50 from any one
       source in any one year. So, $20 per source, per occasion, with an
       aggregate limit of $50 per source, per year. This exception DOES
       NOT apply to gifts of cash or investment interests.
     * Gifts which are offered because of a personal relationship are also
       OK, even though your friend or relative works for a prohibited
       source. However, you must be careful that they do indeed come from
       your friend or relative and are not being paid for by a company
       that is a prohibited source.
     * Discounts and similar benefits, including favorable rates and
       commercial discounts, are acceptable even when they are offered to
       a limited class of employees, provided that the class is defined so
       as not to discriminate among Government employees on the basis of
       employment, rank, rate of pay, or type of official responsibility.
     * Honorary degrees and Awards require advance approval by the Deputy
       Ethics Counselor. Awards, other than cash, with an aggregate market
       value of less than $200 may be accepted, even if the award is for
       meritorious public service or actions taken in an official
       capacity. If the award is cash, or exceeds the $200 threshold, it
       still may be accepted with the advance approval of the Deputy
       Ethics Counselor. In addition, the DEC must determine that the
       award is given on a regular basis and pursuant to selection
       standards or chosen by a committee.
     * Gifts based on outside relationships may also be accepted. When we
       speak of outside relationships, we are talking about gifts which
       are offered to you because of your outside employment or
       activities, or because of your spouse.
     * There are also exceptions for speaking engagements. If you are
       speaking in your official capacity, at a conference, seminar, or
       training session, all conference fees may be waived on the day of
       your presentation; and, if you are going to be a luncheon or dinner
       speaker, you may sit at the head table and eat the rubber chicken
       along with the rest of the dignitaries.

   See the Standards of Conduct, 5 CFR 2635, Subpart B, for additional
   information and proper disposition of prohibited gifts.

   For additional information, contact your Deputy Ethics Counselor or
   your ICD's Ethics Coordinator.
