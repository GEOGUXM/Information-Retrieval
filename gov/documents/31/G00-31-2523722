                             Christine C. Boesz
                              Inspector General

   The Inspector General heads the Office of the Inspector General (OIG),
   and reports directly to the National Science Board (NSB) and the
   Congress. The OIG recommends policies to promote economy, efficiency,
   and effectiveness in administering NSF programs and operations. It also
   aims to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse: to improve the
   integrity of NSF programs and operations, and to investigate cases
   involving misconduct in science.

   Dr. Christine C. Boesz assumed her duties as Inspector General of the
   National Science Foundation on January 18, 2000. Prior to that, she
   served as Head, Regulatory Accountability, at Aetna U.S. Healthcare
   (AUSHC), a subsidiary of Aetna, Inc. In that position, Dr. Boesz was
   responsible for establishing and maintaining a compliance program for
   Medicare legislative and regulatory activities. She has also held
   several government compliance and oversight positions during an 18-year
   career with the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), including
   Director, Operations and Oversight, Office of Managed Care, at HCFA.

   Dr. Boesz received her Doctorate in Public Health from the University
   of Michigan School of Public Health (1997). Her M.S. in Statistics was
   awarded by Rutgers University (1967) and she received her B.A. in
   Mathematics from Douglass College (1966).
