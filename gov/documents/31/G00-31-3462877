   Executive Director's Report

EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS REPORT TO THE COMMISSION MEETING OF DECEMBER 19, 2001

   PERSONNEL CHANGES:
   No changes to report this month.

   SUMMARY OF EVENTS:
   FTA Administrator Visit, San Francisco, November 30
   Several commissioners and MTC staff were involved in activities
   associated with FTA Administrator Jenna Dorn's visit to the Bay Area.
   Vice Chair Kinsey was master of ceremonies at a morning press
   conference with Administrator Dorn to announce the forthcoming pilot
   test of the TransLink® universal fare card. Later that day and on
   Saturday morning, Ms. Dorn toured the alignments for the proposed Muni
   Metro Central Subway project and the BART extension to San Francisco
   Airport. Finally, on Friday evening, MTC hosted a dinner for Ms. Dorn
   with board members and executive staff from the Bay Area Partnership.

   Rail-Volution Conference, San Francisco, November 30 - December 2
   Therese McMillan and I participated in panel discussions at the
   conference on TEA 21 reauthorization and our Housing Incentive Program
   (HIP), respectively.

   TIFIA Loan for Bay Bridge Project, Washington DC, December 4
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta announced a $450 million loan
   under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act
   (TIFIA) to Caltrans for construction of the new eastern span of the San
   Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. This TIFIA loan will supplement other
   federal and bridge toll funding provided under AB 1171 (Dutra).

   Federal Planning Certification Conditions, Sacramento, December 4
   You will recall that MTC's triennial planning certification in 2000 was
   conditioned upon our accomplishing two follow-up corrective actions:
   (1) an evaluation of our public involvement process; and (2) a social
   equity/environmental justice analysis of the 2001 RTP. We received a
   letter on December 4 from the Federal Highway Administration and
   Federal Transit Administration stating that we had satisfied the first
   condition and that they were reviewing the material we submitted to
   determine whether we have complied with the second condition as well.

   Lunch with Assemblyman John Dutra, Fremont, December 4
   Assemblyman Dutra hosted a lunch for Jeff Morales, Director of
   Caltrans, and me to discuss the passage of AB 1171 regarding toll
   bridge seismic retrofit funding as well as upcoming legislative issues
   for the 2002 session.

   Air and Waste Management Association, San Francisco, December 4
   Jean Roggenkamp from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District and I
   briefed the members of this group's San Francisco chapter on the 2001
   Federal Ozone Plan.

   CARB Stakeholder Process, Sacramento, December 5
   We have received a letter from the California Air Resources Board
   indicating that Commissioner DeSaulnier and I have been invited to join
   a group of public and private stakeholders to follow up on the 2001
   Federal Ozone Plan's pledge to identify transportation and other
   control measures to achieve additional emission reductions, such as
   those measures proposed for further study in the 2001 Plan. A first
   meeting of the group is proposed for January 2002.

   CMA Association Meeting, San Francisco, December 7
   Therese McMillan and I attended the monthly Congestion Management
   Agency Association meeting to discuss numerous issues relating to the
   2001 RTP as well as planned efforts to strengthen the Bay Area
   Partnership in early 2002. I will be coming to the MTC Administration
   Committee in January for approval of a consultant contract to assist in
   that effort.

   ISTEA 10TH Anniversary Dinner, Washington, DC, December 12
   The Surface Transportation Policy Project hosted a 10-year anniversary
   event celebrating ISTEA's passage. The event, featured speeches by
   Senator James Jeffords and Senator Paul Sarbanes, Chairmen of the
   Environment and Public Works Committee and the Banking, Housing and
   Urban Affairs Committee respectively -- the two Senate committees that
   will be most involved in reauthorization of TEA 21. The House was
   likewise represented by Congressman Petri, Chairman of the Subcommittee
   on Highways and Transit, House Transportation and Infrastructure
   Committee. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta also spoke of the
   success of the past ten years as well. He recounted how as Mayor of San
   Jose he learned from Larry Dahms and MTC that in order to achieve real
   change in transportation policy, metropolitan areas had to have a seat
   at the table, and that this was the most important achievement of ISTEA
   and TEA 21. Tom Bulger and Randy Rentschler represented MTC at the
   event.

   CTC Reception and Dinner, San Francisco, December 12
   The California Transportation Commission's regular monthly meeting was
   in San Francisco, and Therese McMillan, Dianne Steinhauser and I
   participated in the social activities surrounding their meeting. I also
   introduced several of our Bay Area partners for in-depth project
   briefings before the CTC on December 13.

   Bay Area Poll, San Francisco, December 14
   The Bay Area Council released its annual poll of the region's residents
   and again transportation topped the list of concerns at 32% of
   respondents polled. However, the state of the economy came in a close
   second at 27% of respondents polled - up from only 3-6% for the past
   three years.

   Caltrans Release of ITIP List, Sacramento, December 17
   Caltrans has finally released its proposed Interregional Transportation
   Improvement Program (ITIP) list for inclusion in the 2002 STIP to be
   adopted by the California Transportation Commission (CTC) early next
   year. The ITIP list includes most of the projects sought by our local
   partners, with two exceptions: the I-80/680 interchange project in
   Solano County and the U.S. 101 widening in the Santa Rosa area. We will
   seek to secure funding for these two projects before final CTC action
   on the 2002 STIP.
