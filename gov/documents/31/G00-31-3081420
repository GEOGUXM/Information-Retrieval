   Introduction:

   Industrial Engineering is concerned with the design, installation,
   improvement, evaluation, and control of technical systems.  The
   objective of Industrial Engineering is to promote quality, efficiency,
   and productivity by optimizing resources while concurrently minimizing
   costs.  The tools of industrial engineering are very diverse ranging
   from rigorous mathematical models and design of experiments, to
   continuous process improvement and operations research.  Computer
   Simulation, neural networks, and expert systems are all tools aimed at
   understanding, evaluating and optimizing dynamic systems.  Select from
   the topics below for more detailed information.
   Stochastic Modeling
       Stochastic modeling normally require the use of simulation of a
       system that has random behavioral component. Simulation is the
       modeling or imitation of the operation of real systems or processes
       over time.  The simulated model can be used to study a variety of
       "what if" scenarios about the real system, as well as evaluate or
       identify existing or potential problem areas.
       Neural Networks
       Neural network analysis is an artificial intelligence (AI) approach
       to mathematical modeling.  Neural networks can be implemented for
       advanced control, data and sensor validation, pattern recognition,
       diagnosis and prediction, fault classification, and multivariable
       quality control applications.
       Expert System Design
       Expert systems are a class of programs that emulate human expertise
       in well-defined problem domains.  Expert systems use
       knowledge-based rules, heuristics, and inference to provide
       solutions to problems through various techniques such as process
       automation, system diagnostics, and forecasting.
