   The Regional Printing Center Manila
   is part of the Overseas Operations division of United States Department
   of State Multimedia Services office. For over 50 years it has provided
   Foreign Affairs Agencies with an economical source for printing with
   assurances for high quality and dependable worldwide delivery. For more
   details on the history of the Center click here.
   General Guidance For FY 2001
   Effective October 1, 2000, the Regional Printing Centers (RPC) in
   Manila and Vienna will become Working Capital Fund (WCF) cost centers.
   A WCF operation must recover all of its operating costs (i.e.,
   Salaries, benefits, supplies, materials, ICASS, etc.) By directly
   billing its customers. Prior to FY 2001, Public Diplomacy printing
   accounts were billed only for the cost of supplies and materials. The
   department covered the remainder of RPC's operating expenses such as
   salaries, benefits, utilities and ICASS costs.
   For FY 2001, the WCF will include Vienna and Manila's total operating
   expenses. FY 2001 pd allotment bases will be increased proportionately
   to cover these WCF charges. All funding that was previously allotted to
   the regional printing centers in FY 2000 will be distributed by FMP to
   Public Diplomacy programs in FY 2001 to fully cover the WCF costs.
   Since funds will be allotted directly to the Regional and PD bureaus,
   RPC Manila and Vienna will no longer monitor printing accounts.
   Instead, a fiscal strip must be provided to Manila or Vienna with each
   printing request.
   Overseas posts can place orders telegraphically, by e-mail or fax
   stating the certifying officer's name and that funds are available.
   Domestic elements should submit form DS-5 through the Customer Service
   Center, Office of Multi- media Services (A/RPS/MMS) MS Room 1758 or the
   overseas printing division (A/RPS/MMS/PRO) at SA-44.
   Admin sections are also reminded that the printing services of both
   facilities are available for any printing requirement, specifically
   including non-PD items.
