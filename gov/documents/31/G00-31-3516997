   What is a shortage area?

     According to the report on Educator Supply and Demand in Washington
     from April 2000 a  subject matter shortage area is defined as:

 [arcbul1a.gif]

                Special Education
 [arcbul1a.gif]

                English as a Second Language
 [arcbul1a.gif]

                Chemistry
 [arcbul1a.gif]

                Physics
 [arcbul1a.gif]

                Japanese
 [arcbul1a.gif]

                Mathematics
 [arcbul1a.gif]

                Technology Education
 [arcbul1a.gif]

                The legislation  also defines shortage areas as shortages due to
                geographic location.


     NOTE:  Individual districts may have additional or other shortage
     areas.

   When does this program begin?


   [arcbul1a.gif]

   On September 14, 2001,  school districts in Washington were sent a
    “request for proposal” through which they will apply, in collaboration
   with a higher education teacher preparation program, to operate one
   or more of the three alternative route programs.


   [arcbul1a.gif]

   All School District applications have been received as of 4pm,
   November 16, 2001.  The PESB and OSPI are reviewing the applications
    and the PESB will select the districts who will receive grant money to
    operate these programs at their meeting on November 27th in
   Vancouver, Washington.


   [arcbul1a.gif]

   On December 14, 2001 the PESB announced the districts chosen to receive
   grant money to operate these programs. Show me the list!


   [arcbul1a.gif]

   Some programs for classified instructional employees currently
   employed by a Washington State Public School District may begin as
   early as Winter, 2002.


   [arcbul1a.gif]

   Programs for individuals in other professions seeking to transition to
   teaching in Washington State will begin Summer, 2002.

   Would I qualify for an alternative route?

     For all three, you must be seeking teacher certification in an area
     that the district in which you will intern currently has identified
     SHORTAGE AREAS.   This may include a subject area shortage, such as
     a shortage of high school math or chemistry teachers, or a shortage
     due to geographic location.

   How much does it cost?
   What sort of financial assistance is available?

     All participants in the alternative routes program are eligible for
     stipends during their mentored internship.  The amount of the
     stipend is 80% of the BA+0 cell on the statewide salary schedule.


     Participants in Routes 1 and 2 are further eligible for tuition
     assistance in the form of loan forgiveness for the
     flexibly-scheduled coursework that will accompany their mentored
     internship.   One year of tuition will be forgiven for every two
     years of teaching in a Washington public school.


     Route 3 participants will be responsible for the costs associated
     with participation in the Summer Teaching Academy.

     application process, which must include the entry requirements
     listed for ROUTE 1, ROUTE 2, and ROUTE 3.

   What if I don’t qualify for an alternative route?
   What are other options for becoming a certified teacher?

     Washington has many outstanding teacher preparation programs.  There
     are programs for individuals who do not yet have a bachelors degree,
     those with bachelors degrees seeking certification, and Masters in
     Teaching programs through which individuals can gain both their
     certification and a masters degree.


     For more information on teacher preparation programs, see the
     certification web site at the Office of the Superintendent of Public
     Instruction at www.k12.wa.us/cert.
