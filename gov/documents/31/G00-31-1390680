CPSC Announces Recall of Furnaces in California

   WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)
   is announcing a recall of about 30,000 furnaces sold in California.
   Seven firms are offering to repair or replace certain furnaces, which
   were sold under their own labels, but were manufactured by Consolidated
   Industries Inc. The units involved are gas-fired horizontal furnaces
   equipped with steel "NOx" rods installed above the burners and are
   commonly called NOx rod furnaces. These furnaces pose a substantial
   risk of fire.
   CPSC has received 50 reports of fires associated with the 140,000
   horizontal furnaces manufactured by Consolidated Industries Inc. No
   injuries have been reported.
   All the furnaces can be identified by the steel rods installed above
   the burners. The firms participating in this recall are Amana Company,
   L.P., of Amana, Iowa; Bard Manufacturing, of Bryan, Ohio; Carrier
   Corporation, of Syracuse, N.Y.; Goettl Air Conditioning Inc., of
   Phoenix, Ariz.; Goodman Manufacturing Company L.P., of Houston, Texas;
   Heat Controller Inc., of Jackson, Mich.; and The Trane Company, a
   division of American Standard Inc., of Tyler, Texas.

   Home, hardware and specialty stores, and independent contractors sold
   these furnaces in California from January 1983 through December 1992
   for about $2,000.
   Consumers should check to see if their furnace is part of this recall
   immediately. If so, or for more information, consumers should call
   toll-free at (877) 347-6456 anytime, or contact the recall web site at
   www.furnaceinspect.com. Consumers should have the brand name, model
   number and serial number of their furnace available when they call or
   contact the web site. The recall program offers free inspection and
   repair of the furnaces. Consumers can elect to receive a new furnace,
   free of charge, except for installation costs.
   CPSC issued a safety alert warning about these furnaces in September
   2000. Consolidated Industries (formerly Premier Furnace Co.), which is
   being liquidated under Chapter 7 bankruptcy laws, manufactured
   approximately 140,000 of these furnaces for sale in California between
   1983 and 1994 under many different brand names. About 110,000 of these
   furnaces were manufactured and distributed under the
   Premier/Consolidated labels. They are not covered by this recall
   program. However, there is on-going private litigation which could
   enable consumers to recover at least some of their out-of-pocket
   expenses for replacement or repair of the Premier/Consolidated brand
   furnaces. For more information about the private litigation, call (408)
   808-1410 or visit the web site at www.white-macdonald.com.
