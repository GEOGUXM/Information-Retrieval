   Accessibility Policy

   We are committed to making the Texas/TexasOnLine web site accessible to
   all users and we have included several features designed to
   improveaccessibility for users with disabilities. We have tested the
   redesign with several screen readers and other web tools. The results
   of these reviews have been incorporated into the web site. We welcome
   comments on how to improve the site's accessibility for users with
   disabilities.

   If you use assistive technology and the format of any material on our
   web sites interfere with your ability to access the information, please
   use the following point of contact for assistance. To enable us to
   respond in a manner most helpful to you, please indicate the nature of
   your accessibility problem, the preferred format in which to receive
   the material, the Web address of the requested material, and your
   contact information.
