                        Plasma Channel Focusing of Heavy Ion Beams

   Final focusing of ion beams and their propagation in a target chamber
   are crucial for heavy-ion-beam-driven fusion power production. The
   method and technical realization of these operations have strong
   impacts both on the design of the accelerator and the layout of the
   target chamber. Most studies today are based on ballistic focusing by
   magnetic quadrupole lenses. With ballistic focusing, the focal spot
   size depends on the current and shape of the beam pulse that is
   delivered by the driving accelerator. To reduce space charge blow-up of
   the driver beam in the final focus region the total beam current is
   divided into several beams, each with an individual final focusing
   system and a separate beam port in the target chamber.

   There are several possible alternative methods of focusing and
   transporting the beam. This report describes one that is technically
   challenging, but offers a number of desirable features. The method is
   to strip the ions to a high charge state and to space charge and
   current neutralize the beam completely. An external focusing force is
   then applied to the beam to focus and transport it to the target. One
   advantage of this scheme is its physical simplicity because the beam
   can be treated as an ensemble of independent particles in the external
   focusing field. To create the focusing force the magnetic field of a
   high current plasma discharge can be used. This plasma lens focusing
   relaxes the requirements on emittance and energy spread of the beam
   significantly. A further advantage of this concept is the insensitivity
   to the beam current and pulse shape.

   Fig. 1 Schematic of channel focusing of heavy ion beams to an inertial
                                fusion target

   A schematic that illustrates the concept is shown in Fig. 1. The
   preformed Z-discharges adiabatically focus and transport the beams to
   the target. A pulsed laser is used to "designate" the current channels
   to and from the fusion target. A high voltage applied along the channel
   breaks down the gas and drives several tens of thousands of amperes
   through the channel. The theta-directed fields generated by the channel
   current are sufficient to confine the heavy ion beams and precisely
   guide them to the fusion target. Largely because light ion fusion
   requires high beam currents, this approach was originally considered by
   researchers studying the light ion approach to inertial fusion.

   We are performing two experiments at LBNL to investigate this concept:
   the first studies the physics of the adiabatic focusing of an intense
   potassium beam generated by the 2-MeV Injector; the second studies the
   formation and interactions of free-standing Z-discharge channels at
   parameters that are appropriate for driver quality heavy ion beams.
