Overview

   The Main Injector will supply a larger flux of protons for antiproton
   production, more intense proton bunches for use in the collider, and a
   higher efficiency acceleration of antiprotons. The role of the Recycler
   Ring is to provide more antiprotons for the Tevetron, which
   proportionally increases the luminosity. This is accomplished by acting
   as a high reliability post-Accumulator and receptacle for recycled
   antiprotons from previous Collider stores. Prior to the development of
   the Recycler ring, the peak luminosity goal of the Fermi III upgrade
   program was 8x10^31cm^-2sec^-1. With the construction of the Recycler
   ring, a typical peak luminosity of 2x10^32cm^-2sec^-1 is expected.
