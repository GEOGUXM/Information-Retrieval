              When youre head of a union, youve got to be a sociologist, marriage
   counselor, father confessor, psychiatrist, economist, legal expert, all
   wrapped into one. You must have the desire to help people help
   themselves.

   When the ribbons came off the package of Joe Beirne, these
   inter-related characters seemed to jump out of the box. A proud
   Irish-American, Beirne rose from a Jersey City working class
   neighborhood to become founding president of the Communication Workers
   of America. Beirne emerged as a leader early in life when at age 26 he
   guided a loose amalgam of New Jersey Western Electric company unions
   into a strong local of the National Federation of Telephone Workers.
   Six years later Beirne was elected president of that federation, and he
   remained president when the federation later emerged as the progressive
   and powerful Communication Workers of America. As CWA president, Beirne
   became counselor to Presidents and Popes, and his philanthropy in
   secular and religious charity was exceptional. From his union pulpit
   Beirne never stopped preaching the gospels of worker solidarity and
   national bargaining. His last official act as CWA president in January
   1974 was to announce that AT&T had finally agreed to nationwide pattern
   bargaining. Beirne died eight months later, on Labor Day.
