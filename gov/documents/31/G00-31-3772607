   FIDO/Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Field Tests
   30 April- 11 May 2001
   FIDO Rover Thumbnail
   The Level 1 requirements for the Mars Exploration Rover mission are to
   be accomplished by the two MER rovers and the Athena payloads that they
   each carry. Full Mission Success (which must be achieved under nominal
   martian environmental conditions) requires that the two rovers together
   visit a total of 8 locations, and that they each use their Athena
   instrument suite to investigate the context and diversity of the
   martian geologic environment. It also requires that at least one rover
   must achieve a total integrated traverse distance (wheel odometry) of
   at least 600 m, with a goal of 1000 m.
   The blind desert field trials (i.e. rover mission operators at JPL have
   no knowledge of the remote test site) to be accomplished from April 30
   - May 11, 2001, will involve the MER prototype, JPL's FIDO, to test
   MER-like operational sequences and to train the Athena Science Team
   using realistic terrain and complex geological settings. The intent is
   to set up goals and objectives based on the Level 1 requirements and to
   see how well they can be met.The field trials and the associated
   preparatory work in the Mars Yard can be thought of as ways of lowering
   mission risk, in that proposed sequences will be tested in realistic
   settings and the Athena Team will be trained on how to conduct
   field-based science using MER-class rovers with elements of the Athena
   Payload.
