               Istook to Reintroduce Constitutional Amendment

   Washington, D.C. - Wednesday, Congressman Ernest Istook (R-OK) will
   reintroduce the Religious Freedom Amendment. Istook will make the
   announcement at a pro-family rally on the Capitol steps sponsored by
   the Religious Freedom Coalition, a group headed by William J. Murray,
   son of Madalyn Murray O'Hair and one of the original plaintiffs in the
   1963 Supreme Court case which outlawed state-sanctioned prayer in
   public schools.

   Accompanied by ten gospel choirs, over one hundred inner city pastors
   will present petitions calling for voluntary prayer and religious
   freedom in public schools. Other members of Congress speaking include
   Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay.

   The news conference will be Wednesday, September 15, from 2:00 to 4:00
   PM on the west front terrace steps of the Capitol. Congressman Istook
   will be speaking at approximately 3:25 p.m.
