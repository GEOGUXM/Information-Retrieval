     The authors of this web site are fellow Federal employees from
     several Federal agencies. It is currently a partnership of
     volunteers from the Department of Agriculture, Department of Labor
     (Employment and Training Administration) and the National
     Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Additionally, we are
     being strongly supported by friends and colleagues from the
     Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency.

     Most of us are also 1995-1996 Excellence in Government Fellows. As
     Fellows, we are encouraged to create a project which we feel can
     make a difference to our Agencies and/or to Federal service and
     service to the American people. Our belief is that one of the most
     critical things we can do to assure the continuance of high quality
     governmental services to the American people is to help maintain the
     morale of the Federal work force and to provide information to our
     colleagues who are looking to a future after their Federal careers.
     We also believe that to the extent that we can assist Federal
     employees in making an orderly transition from Federal employment
     that we will also contribute to reducing the adverse impacts of
     budget cuts and RIFs upon our agencies.
