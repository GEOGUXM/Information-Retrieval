                                   What is GRIN?

       The Great Images in NASA (GRIN) system provides a database of photos
      documenting NASA. Photos include: aircraft structures, aircraft design,
      aircraft models, wind tunnel tests, materials research, space programs,
    astronaut training, robotic planetary exploration and images taken by
     NASA spacecraft such as the Hubble Space Telescope and Mars Global
    Surveyor. GRIN contains many, but not all of the most popular images
    from NASAs history. It also contains important historical images that
      you may not have seen before. We created GRIN because the History
      Office receives many requests for photos. This public database is
    intended to meet that need. We used various criteria to select photos
     for GRIN. These include the historical interest and popularity of a
    photo and its visual impact. While you will find many photos that you
      have seen before in popular media, we also wanted to include more
    obscure but interesting photos as well, particularly photos from the
    early NACA years before NASA was created. There are many great photos
    of aeronautical research at NACA and NASA. While GRIN is not supposed
     to be totally comprehensive, we did attempt to cover all aspects of
    NASAs history. If you have any suggestions for additional photos that
     you think meet the GRIN criteria, please contact us at the address
                                   below.

          What image formats and resolutions are available on GRIN?

    All of the images on GRIN are in JPEG format. There are four possible
        image resolutions with the following general characteristics:
     * Thumbnail: an 8 x 10 inch image at 9 dpi yielding approximately 80
                  pixels (suitable for quick visual reference)
      * Small: an 8 x 10 inch image at 64 dpi yielding approximately 600
             pixels (suitable as a medium quality image for the Web)
     * Medium: an 8 x 10 inch image at 150 dpi yielding approximately 1350
              pixels (suitable as a high quality image for the Web)
     * Large: an 8 x 10 inch image at 300 dpi yielding approximately 2700
                    pixels (suitable for printed publishing)

   The medium and large resolution images are usually available except in
      cases where the original digitized image did not have sufficient
    resolution (e.g. image created on a low-end digital camera). To find
   out which image resolutions are available for a particular image, click
     on the More Information link and scroll to the bottom of the page.

        What is JPEG and how do I display a JPEG image on my screen?

       JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized image compression
      mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the
           original name of the committee that wrote the standard.
   Most popular browsers can display low resolution JPEG images within the
   browser itself. However if your browser cannot display a JPEG image or
    your browser is having difficulty displaying a higher resolution JPEG
     image then check the JPEG FAQ to find a JPEG image viewer for your
                                  computer.

                         Where are pictures of ...?

    The picture that you are looking for may be available from some other
    NASA Center try NIX (NASA Image eXchange) to search at the other NASA
                                  Centers.

             How do I use a GRIN image in my own HTML document?

         Since each GRIN image is stored in at least 2 and at most 4
   resolutions: thumbnail (~96x96), small (~544x480), medium (~1280x1024),
            and large (~3072x2432), there are four possible URLs.

                The URL for a thumbnail resolution image is:
        http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/GRIN/IMAGES/THUMB/GPN-yyyy-#####.jpg
    (Where yyyy is a year and ##### is the 5 digit GRIN Database number)

                  The URL for a small resolution image is:
        http://girn.hq.nasa.gov/GRIN/IMAGES/SMALL/GPN-yyyy-#####.jpg

          The URL for a medium resolution image (if available) is:
        http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/GRIN/IMAGES/MEDIUM/GPN-yyyy-#####.jpg

           The URL for a large resolution image (if available) is:
        http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/GRIN/IMAGES/LARGE/GPN-yyyy-#####.jpg

    Here is an example on how to display an icon and make it display its
                   small resolution version when clicked:
   <A HREF="http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/GRIN/IMAGES/SMALL/GPN-yyyy-#####.jpg">
   <IMG SRC="http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/GRIN/IMAGES/THUMB/GPN-yyyy-#####.jpg"
                          ALT="GPN-yyyy-#####"></A>

            How do I download an image directly to my disk drive?

    Click on your preferred image resolution link (e.g. Thumbnail, Small,
                           Medium, or Large) with:
     * right mouse button on a PC
     * middle mouse button on Unix
     * option key and mouse button on Macintosh

    to display a pop-up menu from which you should select "Save Link As"
      (or "Save Target As" on Internet Explorer). Select an appropriate
   location to save the image on your disk drive and save link as Source.
