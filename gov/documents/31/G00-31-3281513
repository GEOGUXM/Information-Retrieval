Introduction

   This page is an interface to my program X0h calculating crystal
   susceptibilities X[0] , X[h] (chi-zero , chi-h) for x-ray scattering
   and Bragg diffraction. The program also provides the associated values
   of the Bragg diffraction peak halfwidth, extinction and absorption
   lengths, which can be helpful in the analysis of respective
   experiments.

   The calculation consists of 5 steps:
    1. Calculation of scattering factors f(s).
    2. Calculation of dispersion corrections df' and df".
    3. Calculation of dipole and quadrupole absorption cross sections.
    4. Calculation of Debye-Waller temperature factors.
    5. Finally, calculation of X[0] and X[h] by summation of atomic
       scattering over crystal unit cell.

   For step-1 X0h uses the 9-factors interpolation formula and the data
   from the International Tables for X-ray Crystallography [1].

   For step-2 the International Tables contain data for characteristic
   x-ray lines only (Cr-Ka1, Fe-Ka1, Cu-Ka1, Mo-Ka1, and Ag-Ka1).
   Therefore, X0h interpolates them for intermediate wavelengths with the
   help of algorithm published in [2]. This algorithm evaluates the
   oscillator strengths of atoms at their absorption edges for each atom
   constituting the crystal unit cell. Then, Don Cromer's formula [3] for
   df' and df" is applied.

   Please, note:
    1. Because of the interpolation, the data cannot reproduce XAFS and
       must be treated with care in a close vicinity of absorption edges.
       For user's reference X0h prints the closest absorption edge in
       structures at given x-ray energy.
    2. Since the characteristic x-ray lines are located in the energy
       range from 5 to 25 keV (from 0.5 to 2.5 Angstrom), strictly
       speaking, the applicability of the above interpolation technique is
       restricted by that range. However, due to using the efficient
       interpolation technique, in many cases the X0h data can be used in
       a wider range up to 0.1 -- 10 Angstrom. In addition, the interface
       is provided to the two freeware databases of dispersion corrections
       df' and df" -- the ones by Henke-Gullikson-Davis [5] and
       Brennan-Cowan [6], respectively. When one chooses to use external
       databases for df' and df", X0h replaces the data for 5
       characteristic X-ray lines by that from the external database for
       five x-ray wavelengths nearest to the specified x-ray wavelength.
       Then, the same interpolation procedure [2] as described above is
       applied.

   For those who are interested, the Henke-Gullikson-Davis data file is
   downloadable from the LBL and the Brennan-Cowan code is available
   through the SSRL. Also, both of those data files can be found at the
   ESRF DABAX server.

   For step-3 the method of calculating the absorption cross sections by
   Hildebrandt et al [4] is used for the most of elements with Z={6-54}.
   This works well for the 5-25 keV range and Hildebrandt technique is
   recommended for the calculations of Bragg diffraction from crystals
   since the dipole and quadrupole parts of absorption are provided.
   Once the cross sections are calculated, they are used to evaluate the
   Im(X[0]) and Im(X[h]) values.
   For heavy and light elements as well as outside the 5-25 keV energy
   range the dipole part of absorption cross section is calculated through
   df" or several other techniques are applied [2], while the quadrupole
   part is taken zero.
   With the option to use external database for df' and df" the cross
   section is always calculated from df".

   For step-4 the input is taken from [1] either via the Debye temperature
   T[D] , or the room-temperature value for the Debye coefficient B
   (depending on what is available in the references).

   For step-5 X0h makes use of a simple expandable database containing the
   coordinates of atoms in unit cells for a number of crystal structures.
   User are welcome to submit new structures and normally they can be
   added to the database within a day.

   Some more information about X0h and several sample screens of local
   version can be found at   Radicon Radicon Ltd page.

   The expansion plans of this X-ray Server include designing the WWW
   interface to the advanced version of X0h called X0p (or X0h+).
   Currently existing as a MS DOS program only, X0p provides several tools
   for planning x-ray experiments like calculating crystal stereo
   projection diagrams with graphical presentation of relative X[h]
   values, searching for the Bragg reflections under various conditions,
   and simulating Laue patterns of crystals with different surface
   orientations.

   New of June'2001: The Bragg planes search tool of X0p has been made
   available for the WWW access. The parameters defining the search are:
    1. Miller indices range,
    2. Bragg angles range,
    3. Minimum intensity of Bragg reflection defined as |xh|/|x0|,
    4. Range of angles with respect to given plane (e.g. surface).

   The following 3 options are provided to search for the Bragg planes
   making certain angles with given crystallographic plane:
    1. Vary the Bragg planes indices, compute the angle Q with the
       surface, then verify the condition:

                                 Q1 < Q < Q2
       where Q1 and Q2 are the parameters defining the search range.

    2. Vary the Bragg planes indices, compute their Bragg angle QB and the
       angle Q with the surface, then verify the condition:

                              Q1 < Q < QB - Q2
       If Q1=Q2=0, this mode gives all the possible Bragg-case
       reflections.

    3. Vary the Bragg planes indices, compute their Bragg angle QB and the
       angle Q with the surface, then verify the condition:

                            QB - Q1 < Q < QB - Q2
       If the values of Q1 and Q2 are small, this option is very effective
       to search for extremely asymmetric reflections.

   Other possible applications of the search tool are:
     * Find all the planes with the Bragg angles from QB1 to QB2,
     * Find all strong reflections,
     * Find any planes in crystal which make angles from Q1 to Q2 with
       given plane...

   Acknowledgments: The idea of this site appeared under the influence of
   excellent x-ray server at LBL maintained by Eric Gullikson. Some part
   of the X0h code was written in collaboration with Olga Lugovskaya.
   Finally, very systematic practical tests to this program were carried
   out by my wife and collaborator Elena Kondrashkina.

Frequently asked questions

    1. Why x[i0] is positive?
       The sign of x[i0] depends on the choice of exponent representing
       x-ray waves in the media. One can present the waves as either
       exp(ikr) or exp(-ikr) and both of these choices can be found in the
       literature. In the former case X[i0] is positive and in the latter
       one it is negative. The X0h provides the susceptibilities for the
       former case. Please check which expansion you are using before
       applying the X0h data.

    2. Why X0h only gives the absolute values |x[rh]|, |x[ih]| together
       with their phase difference? What it the sign of these numbers?
       Both of x[rh] and x[ih] are generally complex numbers with the
       phase dependent on the choice of the origin of coordinate system in
       the unit cell. However, the scattered x-ray intensity is invariant
       with respect to this phase factor and therefore it is not
       important. The only important parameter is the phase difference
       between x[rh] and x[ih]. X0h provides this value under the name
       "Phase difference (x[rh] - x[ih])" and it is divided by
       PI=3.1416...
