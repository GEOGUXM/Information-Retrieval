                      Project Schedule | Presidential Records Act Overview

   When a United States President leaves office, the records of the
   President's administration are collected and removed from the White
   House offices. What happens to the tons of historical materials created
   by the President of the United States and the White House staff?

   The White House sends the materials to the National Archives and
   Records Administration (NARA), whose staff carefully processes these
   records according to Federal laws. Some records are Presidential
   records, meaning they are public records. Some records are personal,
   meaning they are private papers. Applying the standards for the release
   of Presidential records for public inspection takes time and much work
   by archival staff.

   This process is just beginning for the records created by the Clinton
   Administration. We at the Clinton Presidential Materials Project, part
   of NARA, will devote most of our efforts of the next few years to
   preserving, arranging, reviewing and describing the archival and museum
   holdings while the future Presidential library is under construction.

   As we process collections, archivists will create preliminary finding
   aids and develop information about the materials for our web site. As a
   start, we have posted all four versions of the Clinton White House web
   site, which you can search on our web site. We hope that you will enjoy
   exploring the webpages as they existed during President Clinton's
   Administration. You will find the Virtual Library containing press
   briefings, radio addresses, executive orders, and all other publicly
   released White House publications.

   Other materials about the life and career of William Jefferson Clinton
   are available at the web site for the William J. Clinton Presidential
   Foundation.
