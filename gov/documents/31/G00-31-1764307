               Over-assessment of Interest
   _______________________________________________________________________


                   Over-assessment of Interest Calculation
   The following is the list of criminal cases (by court) in which an
   error in calculating the post judgment interest rate has resulted in an
   over-assessment of interest of $10 or less. The list is in alphabetical
   order by last name of the defendant. If your case is on this list; you
   may request that the clerk of the court, credit the amount of the
   over-assessment to principal. Only in very rare circumstances will that
   credit result in a refund to you. If the over-assessment of interest
   was more than $10, the account has already been corrected.

   The request should:

     1. be in writing;
     2. be signed by the defendant;
     3. be sent to the clerk of the court that entered the judgment;
     4. identify the case by name and number;
     5. request that the over- assessment of interest be credited to
     principal; and
     6. refer to Utah Rule of Criminal Procedure 30(b).
