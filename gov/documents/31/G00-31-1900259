                       Selective Service (the Draft)

   Although there is currently no military draft, men who are American
   citizens (regardless of country of residence) or aliens who are
   permanent residents of the United States are required to register
   within 30 days of their 18th birthday. Within the U.S., registration
   forms should be available at any Post Office. On-line registration is
   also available. To find out more about registration and related issues,
   you may visit the Selective Service System's web site.
