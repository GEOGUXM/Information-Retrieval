   THE WHITE HOUSE

   WASHINGTON - January 20, 2001

   MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

   SUBJECT: Standards of Official Conduct

   Everyone who enters into public service for the United States has a
   duty to the American people to maintain the highest standards of
   integrity in Government. I ask you to ensure that all personnel within
   your departments and agencies are familiar with, and faithfully
   observe, applicable ethics laws and regulations, including the
   following general principles from the Standards of Ethical Conduct for
   Employees of the Executive Branch:

   (1) Public service is a public trust, requiring employees to place
   loyalty to the Constitution, the laws, and ethical principles above
   private gain.

   (2) Employees shall not hold financial interests that conflict with the
   conscientious performance of duty.

   (3) Employees shall not engage in financial transactions using
   nonpublic Government information or allow the improper use of such
   information to further any private interest.

   (4) An employee shall not, except as permitted by applicable law or
   regulation, solicit or accept any gift or other item of monetary value
   from any person or entity seeking official action from, doing business
   with, or conducting activities regulated by the employee's agency, or
   whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance or
   nonperformance of the employee's duties.

   (5) Employees shall put forth honest effort in the performance of their
   duties.

   (6) Employees shall not knowingly make unauthorized commitments or
   promises of any kind purporting to bind the Government.

   (7) Employees shall not use public office for private gain.

   (8) Employees shall act impartially and not give preferential treatment
   to any private organization or individual.

   (9) Employees shall protect and conserve Federal property and shall not
   use it for other than authorized activities.

   (10) Employees shall not engage in outside employment or activities,
   including seeking or negotiating for employment, that conflict with
   official Government duties and responsibilities.

   (11) Employees shall disclose waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption to
   appropriate authorities.

   (12) Employees shall satisfy in good faith their obligations as
   citizens, including all just financial obligations, especially those --
   such as Federal, State, or local taxes -- that are imposed by law.

   (13) Employees shall adhere to all laws and regulations that provide
   equal opportunity for all Americans regardless of race, color,
   religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap.

   (14) Employees shall endeavor to avoid any actions creating the
   appearance that they are violating applicable law or the ethical
   standards in applicable regulations.

   Executive branch employees should also be fully aware that their
   post-employment activities with respect to lobbying and other forms of
   representation will be bound by the restrictions of 18 U.S.C. 207.

   Please thank the personnel of your departments and agencies for their
   commitment to maintain the highest standards of integrity in Government
   as we serve the American people.
