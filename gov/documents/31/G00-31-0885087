   Additional Information on Neuroscience Funding

Funding Opportunities by Type (RFA, PA, Notices and RFP)

   Note: You do not have to respond to a specific funding announcement
   such as a Program Announcement (PA) or a Request for Applications (RFA)
   to get funding. In fact, 80% of grants funded by NINDS are unsolicited.
   However, if you are applying for a grant in response to a Request for
   Applications (RFA) or a Program Announcement (PA), carefully read the
   review criteria and any special instructions before preparing the
   application.
     * Request for Applications (RFA)
       Requests for Applications (RFAs) are solicitations for grant
       applications addressing a defined research topic. Each RFA
       specifies the scope and objectives of the research to be proposed;
       application requirements and procedures; and the review criteria to
       be applied in the evaluation of applications submitted in response
       to the RFA.
     * Program Announcements (PA)
       A program announcement (PA) is used by the institute to announce
       its interest in building or enhancing its research program in a
       particular area. The PA typically is an ongoing solicitation,
       accepting applications for multiple receipt dates, for up to three
       years. The PA specifies the scope and objectives of the research of
       interest, application requirements and procedures, and review
       criteria to be applied.
     * Notices
       Notices are announcements published in the NIH Guide which provide
       policy or other information relevant to funding. The availability
       of supplemental funding for current grantees is sometimes announced
       through a notice.
     * Request for Proposals (RFP)
       A request for proposals (RFP) is developed through extensive dialog
       with the scientific community and solicits proposals for a
       contract. RFPs generally target a specific need or problem and
       indicate the research, development, and/or services to be carried
       out under the terms of the contract. RFPs include a complete set of
       application materials, evaluation criteria and a summary of other
       factors that may influence the final selection.

Funding Opportunities Listed by Scientific Area of Research or by Special
Program

     * Repair and Plasticity
       [RFA] [PA] [RFP]
       Includes spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, recovery of
       function, plasticity of the nervous system, neural circuits that
       underlie specific behaviors, repair of the nervous system in injury
       and disease, stem cell biology, neural prostheses, neuroengineering
       and other means of repairing the nervous system in injury and
       disease.

     * Neurodegeneration
       [RFA] [PA] [RFP]
       Includes neuronal cell death, how protein aggregation damages
       neurons, and the interaction of genes and the environment in the
       etiology of neurodegenerative diseases.

     * Neural Environment
       [RFA] [PA]
       Includes glia, microvascular endothelia, cells of hematopoietic
       origin, and the extracellular matrix are integrally involved in
       maintaining the health of the nervous system and play a crucial
       role in disease. Neurological disorders may result when
       extra-neuronal cells are compromised, as in demyelinating and
       cerebrovascular diseases; when extra-neuronal cells themselves
       become aggressors, as in malignant brain tumors, in human
       immunodeficiency virus and other viral infections, in autoimmune
       disorders of nerve and muscle including multiple sclerosis; in
       acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases involving inflammatory
       mechanisms; and when the cells of the blood-brain barrier are
       dysfunctional. Knowledge about extra-neuronal cells is considerably
       less than that for neurons. Emerging concepts on non-synaptic
       communication among these cells and neurons hold great promise for
       understanding how the nervous system works. Facilitating research
       to integrate our knowledge base on neuronal function and
       communication with extra-neuronal cells can contribute to a broader
       perspective on how we think about the nervous system in the context
       of understanding disease mechanisms. The Neural Environment Cluster
       promotes translating scientific knowledge into useful diagnostic
       tools, research on implementation of prevention measures, and
       development and delivery of targeted therapeutic agents for
       neurological diseases.

     * Systems and Cognitive Neuroscience
       [RFA] [PA]
       Includes higher brain functions that underlie complex behaviors
       such as learning, memory, attention, language, cognition, emotion,
       movement, and response to pain depend on the proper integrated
       functioning of neural circuits. With non-invasive functional
       imaging methods such as PET (positron emission tomography) and fMRI
       (functional magnetic resonance imaging) one can measure not only
       basic brain structure and function but also neural activity
       associated with specific cognitive processes in both humans and
       experimental animals. The identification of surrogate markers to
       detect early changes in brain structure and function is crucial in
       development, disease, treatment, recovery throughout the lifespan.

     * Clinical Trials
       [RFA] [PA]
       Includes scientific initiatives that stimulate translation of ideas
       from basic animal research to testing the safety and early
       indications of efficacy through phases I and II clinical trials,
       epidemiological studies of the natural history and early markers of
       neurological disorders and stroke, to elucidate the causative path
       leading to the disorders and to stimulate the search for new
       treatments and prevention strategies.

     * Neurogenetics
       [RFA] [PA]
       Includes identifying the genes that cause neurological disorders.
       Includes collecting family data and applying molecular genetic
       methodologies for gene identification. Investigating the molecular
       mechanisms through which disease genes act. Includes using animal
       models and in vitro techniques for studying pathways of gene
       function. Developing gene-based therapeutics for neurological
       disorders. Includes gene therapy and pharmaceuticals targeted to
       specific gene products. Investigating the genetic basis of normal
       neural development and function. Includes genetically-based studies
       of neuronal patterning, migration, connectivity, and
       cognitive/behavioral function. Developing resources for
       neurogenetic research. Includes tissue and information registries,
       atlases of gene expression and function, and mutagenesis and
       phenotyping methodologies.

     * Channels, Synapses and Circuits
       [RFA] [PA] [Notices]
       Includes channels, synapses, and neural circuits are fundamental
       structural and functional elements of the nervous system. Detailed
       and integrated knowledge of these elements is essential for
       understanding how the nervous system works under normal and
       abnormal conditions. In recent years, remarkable progress and
       exciting discoveries have been made in the basic research in these
       areas; only few of them, however, have been directly connected to
       mechanisms underlying the causes of numerous neurological
       disorders. The major goals of our program are 1) to continue to
       support the ongoing basic and clinical research; 2) to foster
       research on particular channels, synapses, and neural circuits that
       have immediate medical relevance; and 3) encourage translational
       research that links the discoveries from basic research into
       medication development and therapeutic interventions for treating
       neurological disorders, such as epilepsy.

     * Minority Health and Research
       [RFA] [PA]
       Includes research and research training programs designed to
       attract, retain and develop future minority neuroscience health and
       research professionals.

     * Technology Development
       [RFA] [PA]
       Includes oligonucleotide and cDNA microarrays, protein arrays and
       analyses, data and resource sharing, high-throughput screening,
       molecular-target drug development, combinatorial chemistry,
       anticonvulsant screening project (ASP), gene therapy, animal models
       of disease, small business innovation.

     * Training and Career Development
       [RFA] [PA] [Notices]
       Includes the development, implementation, and management of
       programs for training and career development to meet the future
       needs of research on basic brain processes, from molecular to
       systems and clinical neuroscience.

     * Contracts Management Branch
       [RFP]
       The Contracts Management Branch (CMB) is responsible for the
       management and award of research & development contracts. Research
       & development contracts are developed through extensive dialog with
       the scientific community and generally target a specific need or
       problem.
