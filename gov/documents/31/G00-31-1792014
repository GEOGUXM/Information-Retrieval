   Mission Parameters

   In the last section we arrived at a required effective area of 150 m^2
   for Generation-X. This number and other parameters can be arrived at
   consistently from other different arguments as well. From purely
   observational perspective, on the one hand, one would naturally want as
   large a photon collection area as possible and as fine an angular
   resolution and an energy spectral resolution as possible. One would
   want the capabilities of Generation-X to represent revolutionary
   advances from the existing state of the art such as Chandra,
   XMM-Newton, and Astro-E, and Constellation-X in the near future. Past
   experiences in almost every discipline of science indicate that such
   revolutionary advances would lead to revolutionary discoveries and
   understanding. On the other hand, one would need to recognize that
   there needs to be a connection to existing scientific paradigms and
   established knowledge base so as to ensure continuity as the foundation
   of any revolutionary breakthroughs.

   Angular resolution of the Generation-X Observatory should be comparable
   to or even better than that of Chandra. In other words, we should
   probably require that Generation-X telescopes be at the diffraction
   limit at 1 keV of the inner most shells. Given the source counts from
   the Hubble Deep Fields (Gardner, Brown, & Ferguson, 2000) and the
   recent Chandra observation of the same field (Hornschemeier et al.
   2000), we estimate that confusion should not be a problem if
   Generation-X's angular resolution is comparable to or slightly better
   than that of Chandra.

   Energy resolution should be comparable to or better than those of the
   Constellation-X mission. It is important to be able to study
   composition and measure redshifts directly from the X-ray spectrum. As
   such an energy resolving power of several hundred to one thousand
   should be required.
