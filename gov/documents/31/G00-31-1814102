   The World Will Always Remember September 11

   We will never forget the innocent victims and the brave heroes that
   died attempting to save them. We will never forget the survivors, the
   children, the devastated families and the grieving friends they left
   behind. And we will never forget the victims who came from more than 80
   countries, and many races and religions.

   On December 11, countries across the world held remembrance events and
   played their national anthems at the exact moment the first airplane
   struck the World Trade Center in New York (8:46 a.m.)

   occurred worldwide to show that the world will always remember the
   events of Sept. 11.
