                         About the Core Research Center

   The Core Research Center (CRC) was established in 1974 by the U.S.
   Geological Survey (USGS) to preserve valuable rock cores for use by
   scientists and educators from government, industry, and academia. The
   cylindrical sections of rock are permanently stored and available for
   examination and testing at the core storage and research facility in
   Denver, Colorado. The CRC is currently one of the largest and most
   heavily used public core repositories in the United States. The CRC
   encourages use of its facility by all interested parties. Tours of the
   facility are available by appointment.
