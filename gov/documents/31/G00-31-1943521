             This is a reflight of the STS-83 Microgravity Science Laboratory
             (MSL) mission. MSL was originally launched on April 4, 1997 at
             2:20pm EST and was intended to be on orbit for 15 days, 16
             hours. The mission was cut short due to a problem with Fuel Cell
             #2 and Columbia landed on 4/8/97 after 3 days 23 hours.

             MSL is a collection of microgravity experiments housed inside a
             European Spacelab Long Module (LM). It builds on the cooperative
             and scientific foundation of the International Microgravity
             Laboratory missions (IML-1 on STS-42 and IML-2 on STS-65), the
             United States Microgravity Laboratory missions (USML-1 on STS-50
             and USML-2 on STS-73), the Japanese Spacelab mission (Spacelab-J
             on STS-47), the Spacelab Life and Microgravity Science Mission
             (LMS on STS-78) and the German Spacelab missions (D-1 on STS
             61-A and D-2 on STS-55).

             MSL features 19 materials science investigations in 4 major
             facilities. These facilities are the Large Isothermal Furnace,
             the EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments to the Space Station
             (EXPRESS) Rack, the Electromagnetic Containerless Processing
             Facility (TEMPUS) and the Coarsening in Solid-Liquid Mixtures
             (CSLM) facility, the Droplet Combustion Experiment (DCE) and the
             Combustion Module-1 Facility. Additional technology experiments
             will also be performed in the Middeck Glovebox (MGBX) developed
             by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the High-Packed
             Digital Television (HI-PAC DTV) system will be used to provide
             multi-channel real-time analog science video.

             The Large Isothermal Furnace was developed by the Japanese Space
             Agency (NASDA) for the STS-47 Spacelab-J mission and was also
             flown on STS-65 IML-2 mission. It will house the Measurement of
             Diffusion Coefficient by Shear Cell Method Experiment, the
             Diffusion of Liquid Metals and Alloys Experiment, the Diffusion
             in Liquid Led-Tin-Telluride Experiment, the Impurity Diffusion
             in Ionic Melts Experiment, the Liquid Phase Sintering II
             Experiment (LIF), and the Diffusion Processes in Molten
             Semiconductors Experiment (DPIMS).

             The Combustion Module-1 (CM-1) facility from the NASA Lewis
             Research Center houses experiments on Laminar Soot Processes
             Experiment and the Structure of Flame Balls at Low Lewis-number
             Experiment (SOFTBALL).

             The Droplet Combustion Experiment (DCE) is designed to
             investigate the fundamental combustion aspects of single,
             isolated droplets under different pressures and ambient oxygen
             concentrations for a range of droplet sizes varying between 2
             and 5mm. The DCE apparatus is integrated into a single width MSL
             Spacelab rack in the cargo bay.

             The EXPRESS rack replaces a Spacelab Double rack and special
             hardware will provide the same structural and resource
             connections the rack will have on the Space Station. It will
             house the Physics of Hard Spheres (PHaSE) experiment and the
             Astro/PGBA Experiment.

             The Electromagnetic Containerless Processing Facility (TEMPUS)
             is used for the Experiments on Nucleation in Different Flow
             Regimes, Thermophysical Properities of Advanced Materials in the
             Undercooled Liquid State Experiment, Measurements of the Surface
             Tension of Liquid and Undercooled Metallic Alloys by Oscillating
             Drop Technique Experiment, Alloy Undercooling Experiments, the
             Study of the Morphological Stability of Growing Dendrites by
             Comparative Dendrite Velocity Measuremetns on Pure Ni and Dilute
             Ni-C Alloy in the Earth and Space Laboratory Experiment, the
             Undercooled Melts of Alloys with Polytetrahedral Short-Range
             Order Experiment, the Thermal Expansion of Glass Forming
             Metallic Alloys in the Undercooled State Experiment, the AC
             Calorimetry and Thermophysical Properties of Bulk Glass-Forming
             Metallic Liquids experiment and the Measurement of Surface
             Tension and Viscosity of Undercooled Liquid Metals experiment.

             There will also be experiments on measuring microgravity. They
             include the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS), the
             Microgravity Measurement Assembly (MMA), the Quasi-Steady
             Acceleration Measurement System and the Orbital Acceleration
             Research Experiment (OARE).

             The Middeck Glovebox (MGBX) facility will support the Bubble and
             Drop Nonlinear Dynamics (BDND) Experiment, the Study of the
             Fundamental Operation of a Capillary-driven Heat Transfer (CHT)
             Device in Microgravity Experiment, the Internal Flows in a Free
             Drop (IFFD) experiment and the Fiber Supported Droplet
             Combustion experiment (FSDC-2).

   Launch:

             Launch July 1, 1997 2:02:02 pm EDT. Launch window was 2 hours 30
             min.

             On July 1, 1997 at 10:30am, the astronauts departed the O&C
             building for Launch Pad 39-A and arrived at 10:48am. USAF
             Weather forcasters and meteorologists with the Spaceflight
             Meteorology Group (SMG) at the Johnson Space Center in Houston
             closely tracked KSC's weather. (Reference KSC Weather History
             07/01/1997 1400).

             The crew communications checks were performed at 12:17pm EST and
             the white room was given the go for to leave the flight deck and
             prepare for hatch closure. Countdown clock picked up at T-20
             minute mark and counting at 13:20pm EST and the close out crew
             departed LC-39A. At 13:31 the countdown clock entered the hold
             at the T-9 minute mark. The only concern was a launch commit
             criteria violation for RTLS weather due to a patch of bad
             weather to the southwest. The mission management team decided to
             extend the hold at the T-9 minute mark to give time for the
             Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA) to take a closer look at the
             weather systems. At 12:52:07 all teams were given a go for
             launch and the count came out of the T-5 minute mark at
             13:53:00. The gaseous Oxygen vent hood was retracted at T-2
             minutes 57 seconds and counting. The crew was given the go to
             close and lock visors and T-0 occured at 14:02:02 EDT. SRB
             separation at 2 min 15 seconds and 31 miles downrange. SSME
             cutoff at 14:10:44 EDT. ET separation at 14:11:13 EDT.

             Previously, on Monday, 6/30/97, hoping to preempt expected
             afternoon thunderstorms, NASA managers had decided to move in
             the launch time for Columbia by 47 minutes. The 2 1/2 hour
             launch window was at 2:37pm EST but was rescheduled to open at
             1:50 p.m. The decision to launch early removed one end of
             mission daylight landing opportunity at Edwards Air Force Base,
             CA, but still allowed two daylight landing opportunities at KSC.
             The Rotating Service Structure was retracted to the launch
             position at about 8:30 p.m. and loading of the external tank
             with cryogenic propellants began at about 4:47 a.m. on July 1,
             1997. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 6/30/1997).

             Loading of the external tank with cryogenic propellants is
             scheduled to begin at about 5:45 a.m. Tuesday. The astronauts
             will depart the crew quarters for the launch pad at 11:17 a.m.
             and begin boarding Columbia about a half hour later. The hatch
             will be closed and sealed at 1:07 p.m., leading to launch at
             2:37 p.m. Air Force weather forecasters are currently indicating
             a 90 percent probability of weather prohibiting launch of
             Columbia on July 1. The concern is for thunderstorms and
             associated rain, wind and lightning. Given the possibility of
             severe weather during Tuesday's launch attempt, managers may
             elect to postpone the opening of the launch window by up to two
             hours. If this option is selected, the decision will be reached
             by late Monday afternoon. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             6/29/1997).
             On Sunday, the launch pad was closed for a checkout of the
             firing chain and the Space Shuttle onboard ordnance systems.
             This was followed by the loading of cryogenic reactants into the
             onboard fuel cell storage tanks located beneath the payload bay.
             The fuel cells generate power for Columbia and the Microgravity
             Science Laboratory during the 16-day mission. The reactant
             loading started on schedule at 11 a.m. and because of the
             extended duration of the mission, it took approximately 12 hours
             to complete instead of the usual eight hours. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 6/29/1997).

             On Saturday, 6/28/97, the countdown for the launch of Space
             Shuttle Columbia and the reflight of the Microgravity Science
             Laboratory began on schedule today at 3 p.m. EDT. The STS-94
             astronauts arrived at the Shuttle Landing Facility in their T-38
             jet trainers at 12:25 p.m. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             6/28/1997).

             On Wednesday, 6/25/97, at the launch pad, ordnance installation
             was completed and testing of the pyrotechnic initiator
             controllers was underway. Work to close-out Columbia's aft
             compartment picked-up and continues through Friday. Installation
             of the fabricated "pyro can" assemblies at the orbiter's
             external tank attach points continued. Launch countdown
             preparations also continue with hypergolic propellant
             pressurization in work. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 6/25/1997)

             On Friday, 6/20/97, loading of storable hypergolic propellants
             aboard Columbia continued. Tile installation work on the forward
             reaction control system was completed, with all 36 tiles bonded
             to the vehicle. Bond verification checks will begin after the
             loading of hypergolic propellants. In Columbia's aft
             compartment, work to install the fabricated "pyro can"
             assemblies at the orbiter's external tank attach points
             concludes Saturday. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 6/20/1997)

             On Thursday, 6/19/97, following the STS-94 Flight Readiness
             Review, NASA managers announced July 1 as the official launch
             date for Columbia's reflight of the Microgravity Science
             Laboratory-1 mission. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 6/19/1997)

             On Tuesday, 6/17/97, work to connect the orbiter's mid-body
             umbilical unit, used to load cryogenic reactants aboard the
             orbiter was completed and tile work on the forward reaction
             control system continued. Of the 36 tiles slated for replacement
             at the pad, 28 had been installed. The helium signature leak
             test was in work and loading of the storable hypergolic
             propellants aboard Columbia was scheduled for Thursday. Repair
             work to wiring in avionics bay No. 4 continues through
             Wednesday. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 6/17/1997)

             On Friday, 6/13/97 The main engine flight readiness test was
             successfully completed. Work continued to replace 36 Thermal
             Protection System tiles on Columbia's forward Reaction Control
             System. Shuttle technicians raised the concern of possible
             cracked tiles during routine inspections of the FRCS.
             Evaluations of the FRCS tiles on the entire Shuttle fleet helped
             engineers decide to replace the tiles with stronger ones.
             Preparations began for the hypergolic propellant loading and
             repair work to wiring in avionics bay No. 4 resumed. (Reference
             KSC Shuttle Status 6/13/1997)

             On Tuesday, 6/10/97, in the VAB, Columbia is mated to the
             external tank and mating close-outs were in work. Rework on
             spliced wires in the Shuttle's avionics bay were underway and
             electrical evaluations of a controller check-out unit for
             auxiliary power unit No. 2 were also in work. NASA's plan to
             eventually use a super lightweight external fuel tank requires
             modification to an orbiter's tail service mast. Columbia's tail
             service mast underwent retraction tests over the weekend to
             assist engineers in that effort. Over the weekend, additional
             thermal protection tiles were removed from the orbiter's forward
             reaction control system. More than 30 suspect tiles have been
             removed because of cracks seen during recent inspections.
             Evaluations of the FRCS tiles on the other orbiters have
             resulted in the removal of several tiles from orbiters Discovery
             and Atlantis. Stronger tiles will replace those that were
             removed from each orbiter and the majority of Columbia's tile
             replacement work will be done at the pad. Managers are working
             on a plan to complete the tile work in time for the July 1
             launch date. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 6/10/1997)

             On Monday, 6/2/97, Columbia's payload bay doors were closed for
             flight and the following day technician wrapped up close-out
             work in the orbiter's aft compartment and performed some tile
             work on nose of the vehicle. Preparations were in work for the
             orbiter's move to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) targeted
             for 6/4/97 at about 11 a.m. The external tank and solid rocket
             boosters await Columbia in VAB high bay 1 for a hard mate to be
             completed on Thursday, 6/5/97. Once in the VAB, wiring work will
             continue in the Shuttle's avionics bay 4 and electrical
             check-outs of an auxiliary power unit will pick-up. (Reference
             KSC Shuttle Status 6/03/1997)

             On 5/29/97, inspections of Columbia's forward Reaction Control
             System (RCS) revealed cracks in several thermal protective tiles
             in that vicinity. Work to replace those tiles will be performed
             at the pad and have no impact on the roll out schedule. Due to
             additional wiring work in Columbia's cargo bay, close-outs
             continue in the orbiter's mid-body. The spacelab transfer tunnel
             is now scheduled for installation Friday 5/30/97 and Columbia's
             roll to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) will likely occur on
             June 5. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 5/30/1997)

             On 5/23/97, ammonia servicing was complete. Heat shield
             installation continues through the night and the Water Spray
             Boiler servicing is in work. While working close-outs in
             Columbia's mid-body, technicians noted cracks in two fuse
             holders that are part of the orbiter's power distribution
             system. As a result, work to repair a power distribution
             assembly and replacement of a power controller assembly will
             begin this weekend. The additional work in the mid-body will
             likely delay the installation of the Spacelab transfer tunnel
             until next week. Managers are assessing what impact if any the
             additional work will have on remaining OPF milestones. No impact
             to the overall pad schedule is expected. (Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 5/23/1997)

             On 5/20/97, heat shield installation continued as well as work
             to connect Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) fuel lines. Over the
             weekend, technicians noted a frayed pyrotechnic cable in the
             orbiter's cargo bay. Work continues in the orbiter's midbody to
             repair a frayed pyrotechnic cable. The Spacelab transfer tunnel
             will be installed on Friday. Payload technicians are
             troubleshooting a remote acquisition unit on Spacelab today.
             (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 5/20/1997)

             On 4/25/97, On Friday, Shuttle managers officially announced
             that Columbia would refly the shortened STS-83 mission in early
             July. For planning purposes, the reflight mission was internally
             called STS-83R but now has the official designation STS-94.
             Replacement of two thrusters on Columbia's forward reaction
             control system (FRCS) was completed. Electrical hook-up work
             continues on the FRCS in the Hypergol Maintenance Facility. The
             FRCS should return to the OPF in early May to be reinstalled on
             the orbiter. Postflight work on Columbia's auxiliary power units
             continues through Tuesday, 4/29/97. Spacelab reservicing
             activities also continue. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             4/28/1997)

             On 4/25/97, thruster replacement work continued on Columbia's
             forward Reaction Control System (RCS) in the Hypergol Maintenace
             Facility. The forward RCS should return to the OPF in early May
             to be reinstalled on the orbiter. Postflight work on Columbia's
             Auxiliary Power Units (APU's) continues through Tuesday.
             Spacelab reservicing activities also continue. STS-83R booster
             stacking operations continue in the Vehicle Assembly Building.
             Right forward center segment mating activities are in work
             today. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 4/25/1997)

             On 4/17/97, fuel cell No. 1 leak checks will conducted.
             Preparations continue for main engine removal on Friday 4/18/97
             and Saturday 4/19/97. Forward reaction control system functional
             tests were completed 4/16/97 and FRCS removal is scheduled for
             4/18/97. Removal of the Spacelab tunnel is in work and Spacelab
             reservicing will begin. In the VAB, the booster segments
             originally intended for use on STS-85 are being stacked for use
             on STS-83R. Work to mate the left forward center segment to the
             left aft center segment is scheduled for 4/17/97. The left
             forward segment should arrive in the VAB as well. (Reference KSC

   Landing:

             KSC 7/17/1997 6:47am EDT. Shuttle Landing Facility Runway 33.
             Main Gear Touchdown: 15days 16hours 44min 34sec (6:46:34am EDT),
             Nose Wheel Touchdown: 15days 16hours 44min 45sec (6:46:45am
             EDT). Wheel Stop: 15days 16hours 45min 29sec (6:47:29am EDT).

             A go was given for the deorbit burn at 5:38am EST on orbit 250
             with at landing on orbit 251. The 3min 1sec burn at 05:43
             provided a delta change in velocity of 298.7 ft/sec. This burn
             placed Columbia in a 163x12nm orbit and allowed the vehicle to
             drop out of orbit 4,300 miles from landing site. Weather at the
             landing strip had a visibility of 8 miles 2 knot winds with a
             temperature of 72 degrees and 98 percent relative humidity.
             (Reference KSC Weather History 07/17/1997 0600).

             Weather was expected to be favorable for both landing
             opportunities, although the first still had a slight chance of
             some pre-dawn ground fog developing that would not dissipate in
             time of the decision to land. As the sun heats the atmosphere,
             the ground fog dissipates rather quickly presenting more
             favorable weather. Had a second opportunity been needed, landing
             would have been at 8:22 a.m. EST. Columbia's next mission is
             STS-87. ( Reference STS-94 MCC Status Report # 30)
