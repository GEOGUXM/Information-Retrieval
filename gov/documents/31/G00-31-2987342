   ICD-O-3 SEER Site/Histology Validation List - 6/14/2001 - updated from
   2/9/2001
   This site/type list is provided in both PDF ( sitetype.d06142001.pdf )
   and Excel 95 ( sitetype.d06142001.xls ) formats. The PDF file is
   intended as a reference file for ICD-O-3 only. Although based on the
   2/9/2001 Validation List, it has been stripped of redlining and
   strikeouts. An errata sheet in PDF has been prepared to document
   updates since 2/9/2001.

   ICD-O-3 Hematopoietic Primaries Table - 3/15/2001
   The hematopoietic primaries table indicates whether two hematopoietic
   diseases (such as a lymphoma and a leukemia) diagnosed separately and
   coded in ICD-O-3 should be considered the same primary (S) or different
   primaries (D). The table is based on current medical understanding of
   these diseases as they are listed in ICD-O-3. This table replaces pages
   15-37 in the SEER Program Code Manual (3rd edition, 1998) for cases
   diagnosed on or after January 1, 2001. This table replaces Appendix B
   of the Commission on Cancer's ROADS manual for cases diagnosed on or
   after January 1, 2001. Adobe Acrobat is needed to view the document in
   PDF.

   Clarifications for Abstracting and Coding Hematopoietic Diseases -
   5/22/2001
   Explanation of what therapies are used for the hematopoietic diseases
   and how they should be coded in the treatment fields, further
   description of the hematopoietic primaries table, and additional
   clarifications specific to the hematopoietic diseases. Adobe Acrobat is
   needed to view the document in PDF.

   ICD-O-3 Errata and Clarifications - 5/22/2001
   Corrections for both the soft cover and hard cover versions of ICD-O-3
   and further discussion of issues that were not well described in the
   printed editions of ICD-O-3, such as [obs] and assigning grade or
   phenotypes in the sixth digit of the morphology code. Adobe Acrobat is
   needed to view the document in PDF.
