   Research Interests:

   A primary objective of our program is to determine, in detail, the
   molecular roles T7 RNA polymerase has in initiation of site specific
   "rolling circle" replication of T7 DNA and in T7 packaging. Our aim is
   to identify all the viral and cellular components in the replication
   and processing complexes and provide a detailed molecular description
   of their interactions.

   Part of our efforts involve using recombinant DNA techniques to exploit
   the obvious potential of T7's genetic elements to elicit high level
   expression of foreign proteins in Escherichia coli. We are using the T7
   system to overexpress the genes encoding the major outer membrane
   proteins of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which
   causes a multisystemic disorder that is endemic to Long Island.
   Overexpression of these gene products may be useful for diagnostic
   immunoassays and/or production of vaccines against Lyme disease. These
   studies are correlated with our efforts to sequence the 1 megabase
   linear chromosome of Borrelia burgdorferi using a novel hexamer primer
   library approach.
