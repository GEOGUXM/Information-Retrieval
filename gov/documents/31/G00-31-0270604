   Notice and Opportunity for Comment on
   Proposed Amendments to the Circuit Rules
   Comments are invited on the following proposed amendment to Circuit
   Rule 6-2, Petition for Writ of Certiorari to Review Final Decisions of
   the Supreme Court of Guam. The proposed amendments are in bold.
   Comments should be submitted to Cathy A. Catterson, Clerk of
   Court/Circuit Court Executive, no later than November 30, 2001.
   CIRCUIT RULE 6-2
   PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO REVIEW
   FINAL DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT OF GUAM
   (a) Petition of Writ of Certiorari.
   (1) ****
   (2) ****
   (3) ****
   (b) Consideration Governing Review on Certiorari.
   Review on a writ of certiorari is not a matter of right, but of
   judicial discretion. A petition for writ of certiorari will be granted
   only for compelling reasons. The following, although neither
   controlling nor fully measuring the Court's discretion, indicate the
   character of the reasons the Court considers:
   (1) The Supreme Court of Guam has decided an important question of
   federal or territorial law in a way that conflicts with the decisions
   of the Supreme Court of the United States, this Court, or another
   United States court of appeals; or has so far departed from the
   accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, or sanctioned such a
   departure by a lower court, as to call for an exercise of this Court's
   supervisory power.
   (2) The Supreme Court of Guam has decided an important question of
   federal or territorial law that has not been, but should be, settled by
   this Court.
   (3) The Supreme Court of Guam was without jurisdiction of the cause, or
   where, because of disqualification or other reason, the decision of the
   Supreme Court of Guam lacks the concurrence of the required majority of
   qualified, non-recused judges.
   (4) A petition for a writ of certiorari will rarely be granted when the
   asserted error consists of erroneous findings of fact or the
   misapplication of a properly stated rule of law. A petition for a writ
   of certiorari with respect to any issue or any material fact that was
   omitted from or misstated in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Guam
   will normally not be considered, unless the omission or misstatement
   was called to the attention of the Supreme Court of Guam in a petition
   for rehearing. All other issues and facts may be presented in the
   petition for a writ of certiorari without the necessity of filing a
   petition for rehearing.
   (c) Denomination of the Parties.
   The party petitioning for the writ of certiorari shall be denominated
   the petitioner; the petitioner's denomination in the appeal or other
   proceeding before the Supreme Court of Guam shall also be included. All
   other parties shall be denominated respondents and each respondent's
   denomination in the appeal or other proceeding before the Supreme Court
   of Guam shall also be included. Any respondent who supports the
   position of a petitioner shall meet the time schedule for filing
   responsive papers.
   _ Remaining subparagraphs now (d) through (j).
   (d) Content of Petition.

   NEW PROPOSED AMENDMENT
   CIRCUIT ADVISORY COMMITTEE NOTE
   TO RULE 6-2(b) and (c), added in 2001
   The Guam Organic Act, 48 U.S.C. ยง 1424-2, authorizes the Ninth Circuit
   to "promulgate rules necessary to carry out" its certiorari
   jurisdiction and function granted by that section. The Ninth Circuit
   has interpreted the grant of the 15-year interim certiorari
   jurisdiction to it by ยง 1424-2 as including "jurisdiction to review
   issues of local Guam law." EIE Guam Corp. v. Supreme Court, 191 F.3d
   1123, 1127 (9th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 980 (2000).
   The introductory paragraph of subparagraph (b), and subdivisions (1),
   (2) and the first part of subdivision (4) are patterned after Rule 10
   of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States. Subdivision 93)
   and the latter part of subdivision (4) of subparagraph (b) are
   patterned after Rule 29(a) of the California Rules of Court, which sets
   forth the grounds for discretionary review by the Supreme Court of
   California. Subparagraph (c) is patterned after Rule 40.1(c) of the
   Hawaii Court Rules.
   Indicating that the considerations governing whether the Ninth Circuit
   will grant a petition for writ of certiorari are similar to and
   generally limited to those employed by the Supreme Court of the United
   States is in keeping with the Ninth Circuit's prior indication that it
   will exercise its certiorari jurisdiction sparingly. See EIE Guam
   Corp., 191 F.3d at 1127.
   Purpose of Amendment
   To provide guidance on criteria for seeking certiorari.
