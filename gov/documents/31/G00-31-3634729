   Residential | Non-Residential



        The Presidio is an extraordinary place to live and work.

           Residential Leasing

           The Presidio of San Francisco offers a spectrum of housing options in
           twenty-one distinct and beautiful neighborhoods. Units range in size
           from one to seven bedrooms. Many Presidio homes are contributing
           features to the Presidio's National Historic Landmark designation.
           Non-Residential Leasing

           The Presidio is a remarkable place to work. Over 3.5 million square
           feet of non-residential space exists in the Presidio, located in more
           than 250 buildings. Two-thirds of the buildings are historic,
           representing a variety of architectural styles, from the Spanish era
           through World War II. The Presidio is preserving these buildings
           through rehabilitation and reuse. A variety of leasing opportunities
           are now being offered.
