     __________________________________________________________________

   Origin of Large Scale Structure The CMB provides information on the
   initial conditions for large scale structure, such as galaxies,
   clusters of galaxies, etc.

   Origin of the Universe and Ultra-High Energy Physics CMB observations
   reveal information on the origin of space-time and the energetic
   processes occuring at that epoch and succeeding epochs.

   Geometry & Dynamics of the Universe CMB observations provide
   information on the geometry and dynamics of the Universe. These
   include: the metric, open/flat/closed, shear, vorticity, and
   anisotropic expansion. The current limits on the rotation of the
   Universe are quite tight.

   Determination of Cosmological Parameters Accurate, high-resolution CMB
   observations provide can provide precise determination of various
   cosmological parameters, e.g. the total mass-energy density of the
   Universe (Omega_total), the Hubble expansion rate (Ho), the density of
   baryons (Omega_b) in the Universe, various parameters of inflation or
   of topological defects, the cosmological constant. These must be
   determined within the context of a specific model; however, detailed
   CMB observations are capable of discriminating between cosmological
   models.

   Discriminate between various cosmological models and provide a
   precision test of them along with determining their cosmological
   parameters. As shown in the figure below, the anisotropy power spectrum
   -- rms fluctuation power at each angular frequency ( proportional to
   1/angle) -- is a strong means to discriminate between cosmological
   models.

   Figure caption notes:
   sCDM is standard Cold Dark Matter model with critical density.
       oCDM is an open universe with Cold Dark Matter model
       Lambda CDM is a model universe with Cold Dark Matter and enough
       cosmological constant to make space flat
       STRINGS is a model where large scale structure is seeded by GUT
       strings.

   On the Smoot Group page you can read about the experiments and
   observations of the CMB such as the COBE satellite and its instruments,
   the MAX/MAXIMA/BOOMERANG balloon-borne instrument, and the Planck
   (formerly COBRAS/SAMBA) satellite (now approved by the European Space
   Agency).
