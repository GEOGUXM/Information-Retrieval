                                                         The Great Dying

                             250 million years ago something unknown wiped out most life on our
    planet. Now scientists are finding buried clues to the mystery inside
                        tiny capsules of cosmic gas.

      see caption January 28, 2002:  It was almost the perfect crime.
      Some perpetrator -- or perpetrators -- committed murder on a scale
      unequaled in the history of the world. They left few clues to their
      identity, and they buried all the evidence under layers and layers of
      earth.
      The case has gone unsolved for years -- 250 million years, that is.

      But now the pieces are starting to come together, thanks to a team of
      NASA-funded sleuths who have found the "fingerprints" of the villain,
      or at least of one of the accomplices

      Above:  Life was flourishing on the Earth about 250 million years ago,
      then during a brief window of geologic time nearly all of it was wiped
      out. This image is an artist's impression of a Lower Permian swamp in

      The terrible event had been lost in the amnesia of time for eons. It
      was only recently that paleontologists, like hikers stumbling upon an
      unmarked grave in the woods, noticed a startling pattern in the fossil
      record: Below a certain point in the accumulated layers of earth, the
      rock shows signs of an ancient world teeming with life. In more recent
   layers just above that point, signs of life all but vanish.

   Somehow, most of the life on Earth perished in a brief moment of
   geologic time roughly 250 million years ago. Scientists call it the
   Permian-Triassic extinction or "the Great Dying" -- not to be confused
   with the better-known Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction that signaled the
   end of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Whatever happened during the
   Permian-Triassic period was much worse: No class of life was spared
   from the devastation. Trees, plants, lizards, proto-mammals, insects,
   fish, mollusks, and microbes -- all were nearly wiped out. Roughly 9 in
   10 marine species and 7 in 10 land species vanished. Life on our planet
   almost came to an end.

   Scientists have suggested many possible causes for the Great Dying:
   severe volcanism, a nearby supernova, environmental changes wrought by
   the formation of a super-continent, the devastating impact of a large
   asteroid -- or some combination of these. Proving which theory is
   correct has been difficult. The trail has grown cold over the last
   quarter billion years; much of the evidence has been destroyed.

   "These rocks have been through a lot, geologically speaking, and a lot
   of times they don't preserve the (extinction) boundary very well," says
   Luann Becker, a geologist at the University of California, Santa
   Barbara. Indeed, there are few 250 million-year-old rocks left on
   Earth. Most have been recycled by our planet's tectonic activity.

   Undaunted, Becker led a NASA-funded science team to sites in Hungary,
   Japan and China where such rocks still exist and have been exposed.
   There they found telltale signs of a collision between our planet and
   an asteroid 6 to 12 km across -- in other words, as big or bigger than
   Mt. Everest.
   Many paleontologists have been skeptical of the theory that an asteroid
   caused the extinction. Early studies of the fossil record suggested
   that the die-out happened gradually over millions of years -- not
   suddenly like an impact event. But as their methods for dating the
   disappearance of species has improved, estimates of its duration have
   shrunk from millions of years to between 8,000 and 100,000 years.
   That's a blink of the eye in geological terms.
   "I think paleontologists are now coming full circle and leading the
   way, saying that the extinction was extremely abrupt," Becker notes.
   "Life vanished quickly on the scale of geologic time, and it takes
   something catastrophic to do that."
   Such evidence is merely circumstantial -- it doesn't actually prove
   anything. Becker's evidence, however, is more direct and persuasive:
   see caption Deep inside Permian-Triassic rocks, Becker's team found
   soccer ball-shaped molecules called "fullerenes" (or "buckyballs") with
   traces of helium and argon gas trapped inside. The fullerenes held an
   unusual number of ^3He and ^36Ar atoms -- isotopes that are more common
   in space than on Earth. Something, like a comet or an asteroid, must
   have brought the fullerenes to our planet.

   Above:  The carbon atoms in a fullerene molecule are arranged in a
   spherical pattern similar to a geodesic dome. (Geodesic domes were
   invented by Buckminster Fuller, hence the name of the molecules.) This
   shape allows the fullerenes to trap gases inside. Image courtesy Luann
   Becker.

   Becker's team had previously found such gas-bearing buckyballs in rock
   layers associated with two known impact events: the 65 million-year-old
   Cretaceous-Tertiary impact and the 1.8 billion-year-old Sudbury impact
   crater in Ontario, Canada. They also found fullerenes containing
   similar gases in some meteorites. Taken together, these clues make a
   compelling case that a space rock struck the Earth at the time of the
   Great Dying.
   But was an asteroid the killer, or merely an accomplice?

   Many scientists believe that life was already struggling when the
   putative space rock arrived. Our planet was in the throes of severe
   volcanism. In a region that is now called Siberia, 1.5 million cubic
   kilometers of lava flowed from an awesome fissure in the crust. (For
   comparison, Mt. St. Helens unleashed about one cubic kilometer of lava
   in 1980.) Such an eruption would have scorched vast expanses of land,
   clouded the atmosphere with dust, and released climate-altering
   greenhouse gases.

   World geography was also changing then. Plate tectonics pushed the
   continents together to form the super-continent Pangea and the
   super-ocean Panthalassa. Weather patterns and ocean currents shifted,
   many coastlines and their shallow marine ecosystems vanished, sea
   levels dropped.

   "If life suddenly has all these different things happen to it," Becker
   says, "and then you slam it with a rock the size of Mt. Everest -- boy!
   That's just really bad luck."

   Was the "crime" then merely an accident? Perhaps so. Nevertheless, it's
   wise to identify the suspects -- an ongoing process -- before it
   happens again.

   [coastline_sm.jpg] What happens when a 6 to 12 km space rock hits
   Earth? The initial blast from the impact would sweep over a large area
   of the planet, killing everything in its path. It would throw up
   millions of tons of debris to obscure the Sun, hindering the
   photosynthesis that drives most ecosystems. The heat would release
   large volumes of CO[2] and SO[2] from the vaporization of rocks, and
   ignite the world's forests -- releasing still more CO[2] and inducing
   long-term global warming. As the atmospheric debris slowly rains back
   down onto the surface, toxic compounds might poison much of what life
   remains.

   Mounting Evidence: A research team headed by Kunio Kaiho of the Tohoku
   University in Sendai, Japan, recently announced their measurements of
   sulfur isotopes in rocks from the Permian-Triassic boundary. The P-T
   boundary layer is enriched with "light sulfur" -- much like material
   from our planet's mantle. The finding suggests that some event
   250,000,000 years ago (like an asteroid impact) spread material from
   the mantle over the surface of the land. "Their data suggest that an
   asteroid or comet hit the ocean and caused a rapid, massive release of
   sulfur and other noxious materials from the Earth's mantle to the
   ocean-atmosphere system," agrees Ted Bunch, a research scientist at
   NASA's Ames Research Center and a member of Becker's science team.
