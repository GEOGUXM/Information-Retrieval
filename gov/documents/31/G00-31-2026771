   Certificateholders(Individuals holding a valid Washington State CPA
   certificate as of June 30, 2001) - How to apply for a license:

   If you are interested in applying for a CPA license, you must:
     * Meet the Boards experience requirement and file the appropriate
       experience affidavit form (see WAC 4-25-730 for the Board's rule
       governing licensure, and Policy 2001-2 Experience for additional
       guidance.)  Please note: Certificateholders applying for a license
       prior to July 1, 2004 are not limited to the 8 year look-back
       period.
     * File a Certificateholder License Application (No fee is required)
     * Confirm that you have obtained the required CPE for licensure. The
       CPE requirements for a certificateholder to apply for a license are
       as follows:

     * 0 hours if you have held your certificate* for less than 1 year
       from the date you submit a license application,
     * 40 hours (completed after the date your certificate* was initially
       issued) if you have held your certificate for more than one but
       less than two years from the date you submit a license application,
     * 80 hours (completed after the date your certificate* was initially
       issued) if you have held your certificate for more than two but
       less than three years from the date you submit a license
       application, or
     * 120 hours (completed within the 36 months immediately preceding the
       date you submit your application for a Washington State license) if
       you have held your certificate* more than three years from the date
       you submit a license application.

     * The date your certificate was initially issued is located on your
     original wall certificate; or by contacting the Boards office.

     (See RCW 18.04.105(4)(d) for the applicable statute)

   Certificateholders who do not apply for a license must use the title
   "CPA-Inactive" effective with the start of their next renewal cycle.
   The word "Inactive" must be of the same font (style and size) as the
   word "CPA" or "Certified Public Accountant."  However, you may not use
   the title "CPA-Inactive" to offer or provide accounting, management
   consulting, tax, tax consulting, or similar services to the public (in
   other words you may not practice public accounting in association with
   the title "CPA-Inactive").
