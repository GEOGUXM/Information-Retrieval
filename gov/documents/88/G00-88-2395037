     The Caribbean Regional Node web site is designed to supply users
     with satellite data files and previews in near-real-time. Image data
     is available for a number of different regions and product data
     types. Access to CoastWatch satellite data requires a username and
     password. These are easily obtained by filling out an online
     registration form and agreeing to the provisions. Once you have
     applied, you will be notified of your username and password by
     email.

     After registration, CoastWatch users can download data files for use
     with one of the CoastWatch software packages, plot data using the
     web site online preview, or convert data to other data formats for
     use in GIS or scientific plotting packages.
