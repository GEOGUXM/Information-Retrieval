   [new!.jpg] Geologic Map and Map Database of the Oakland Metropolitan
   Area, Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Francisco Counties, California (MF
   2342)

   by R.W. Graymer

   This publication describes the evolution and distribution of geologic
   materials and structures in the Oakland metropolitan area. The
   publication includes a geologic map and a pamphlet which discusses the
   geologic history, stratigraphy, and geologic structures of the area,
   including the active Hayward Fault Zone, part of the San Andreas Fault
   system. The publication also includes Arc-Info format map database
   (GIS) files that enable rapid manipulation and analysis of the geologic
   information. This publication is part of the U.S. Geological Survey
   contribution to the FEMA sponsored Project Impact in Oakland and
   Berkeley, California. Project Impact is a program designed to reduce
   losses associated with natural hazards by integration of scientific
   information and land-use and hazard-response planning. The geologic map
   data forms one of the basic data sets used for analysis of landslide
   and earthquake hazards.
