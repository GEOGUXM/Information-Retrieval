   Vision
   A future America in which the right to grow to one's full potential is
   universally assured through attention to the comprehensive physical,
   psychological and social needs of the maternal and child health
   population. We strive for a society where children are wanted and born
   with optimal health, receive quality care and are nurtured lovingly and
   sensitively as they mature into healthy, productive adults. MCHB seeks
   a nation where there is equal access for all to quality health care in
   a supportive, culturally competent, family and community setting.
   Strategic Plan

   History
   The Children's Bureau was established in 1912. In 1935, the U.S.
   Congress enacted Title V of the Social Security Act, which authorized
   the Maternal and Child Health Services programs and provided a
   foundation and structure for assuring the health of American mothers
   and children.
