   Customer Service Survey

   Completing the Customer Service Survey will assist the Department of
   Real Estate (DRE) in evaluating the services it provides.  If you need
   assistance from the DRE, please contact the DRE district office nearest
   you or click here to obtain specific contact information for licensing,
   examinations, education sponsor, real estate transactions, mortgage
   lending, and/or subdivision questions.
   To file a complaint about a real estate broker, salesperson or
   subdivider, please submit a Complaint Form (RE 519) via fax or mail.
   Click here for further information about filing a complaint with the
   DRE.
   If you recently contacted the DRE in person, by phone or by mail and
   would like to participate in the survey, click here.  Please note, the
   survey should not be used as a means of communication with the DRE
   since the survey data is captured automatically.  Instead, contact the
   DRE district office nearest you if you have questions or need
   assistance.

   Thank you.
