 The California Coastal Conservancy, a unique state resource agency
 established in 1976 by the Legislature, uses entrepreneurial techniques
 to purchase, protect, restore, and enhance coastal resources, and to
 provide access to the shore. We work in partnership with local
 governments, other public agencies, nonprofit organizations, and
 private landowners.

 To date, the Conservancy has undertaken more than 700 projects along
 the 1,100 mile California coastline and around San Francisco Bay. These
 projects often accomplish more than one of our goals. The Coastal
 Conservancy:
 [smblak.gif] Improves public access to the coast and bay shores by
     acquiring land and easements and by building trails and stairways.
     It also seeks to create low-cost accommodations along the coast,
     including campgrounds and hostels.
     [smblak.gif] Protects and enhances coastal wetlands, streams and
     watersheds.
     [smblak.gif] Restores urban waterfronts for public use and coastal
     dependent industries, especially commercial fishing.
     [smblak.gif] Resolves coastal land use conflicts.
     [smblak.gif] Acquires and holds environmentally valuable coastal
     lands for purposes that are in keeping with the Coastal Act.
     [smblak.gif] Protects agricultural lands.
     [smblak.gif] Accepts donations and dedications of land and
     easements for public access, agriculture, open space, and habitat
     protection.

 The Coastal Conservancy has a staff of 50 and a current annual budget
 of almost $40 million. Since 1976, the Conservancy has used well over
 $200 million to complete its projects. The Conservancy has primarily
 been funded by state general obligation bonds, although its 1998/99
 budget includes over $25 million from the state's general fund.

 The Legislature created the Coastal Conservancy as a unique entity with
 flexible powers to serve as an intermediary between government,
 citizens, and the private sector in recognition that creative
 approaches would be needed to preserve California's coast for future
 generations. The California Coastal Commission, a distinct agency,
 regulates land use and development along the coast; the Coastal
 Conservancy coordinates its work with the Commission and with the San
 Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission.
