                            Locate a Source by Name:

   Infrared sources in the Catalog are listed alphabetically by their base
   name in a Source Atlas which is part of the database. The "base name"
   is usually a constellation name, a catalog name, or the abbreviated
   name of an observer. Many sources may also have prefixes and/or
   suffixes as part of their name. Most source names appear in the Catalog
   in abbreviated form. These abbreviations are not always intuitive. For
   these reasons, it can sometimes be difficult to locate a source in the
   Catalog. However, this option provides a way to easily recognize source
   names by browsing the alphabetical name list.

   After clicking on the appropriate green button below, a list of source
   names arranged alphabetically by base name is displayed. Scroll down
   the list until you find the source name of interest (you can also use
   the Netscape or Internet Explorer FIND option under EDIT, etc.). When
   you click on the source name link, the page in the Catalog containing
   that source will then be displayed. This option does not create a
   summary or report. It simply points to the right page in the Catalog.

   Clicking a green button brings up a list of object with base names
   which begin with the letter you have selected.
   You can scroll through the list and click on a source name of interest.

   [A] [B] [C] [D] [E] [F] [G] [H] [I] [J] [K] [L] [M]
   [N] [O] [P] [Q] [R] [S] [T] [U] [V] [W] [X] [Y] [Z] [0-9]

   (NOTE: The "0-9" button displays names composed only of numbers.)

  REMEMBER: Sources are arranged alphabetically by the base name...
