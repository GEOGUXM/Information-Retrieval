   DTSC: Toxics Questions

   Edwin F. Lowry, Director
   Edwin F. Lowry

   Welcome to the Department of Toxic Substances Control web site. As the
   Director of one of the six California Environmental Protection Agency
   entities, I value your interest in our work. I believe that government
   needs to be honest, open, responsive and direct with the public, and
   that our web site is one method of achieving those ends. My goal for
   this site is that you should be able to locate information about
   hazardous wastes and substances that is timely, accurate, and of
   consistently high quality.
