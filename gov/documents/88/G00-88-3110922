   [p_teach2.gif] Los Alamos National Laboratory is pleased to announce
   the Teacher Help Service.

   This free service is available to any teacher and is being funded by
   Los Alamos National Laboratory.

   Five K-12 teachers who have been using the Internet in the classroom
   for several years are now available to assist you. These mentor
   teachers will help you find resources on the Internet such as projects,
   activities, lesson plans, etc. They are available to help plan a
   project, locate penpals, help you with using just one computer in a
   classroom for a project, etc. The mentor teachers are from different
   parts of the United States so the service can provide both a national
   and a local perspective.

   This free service is available to any teacher and is being funded by
   Los Alamos National Laboratory. To send your request, click on the
