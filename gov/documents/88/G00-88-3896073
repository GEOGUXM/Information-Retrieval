   Council Web Site Privacy Policy

   Thank you for visiting the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's
   Web site. Our privacy policy is clear: The information we automatically
   collect from visitors is always recorded in a general, aggregate form
   for statistical purposes only, in order to measure visitors' interest
   in various areas of our site.

   Information automatically collected at our site

   If a visitor is simply browsing through the pages of our site, or
   reading or printing pages, we will automatically gather the following
   general information: the IP address, browser, and domain (for example,
   ".gov" or ".com") that the visitor's computer uses to access the
   Internet; the time our site was accessed; and which pages and how many
   were traversed while visiting our site.

   This information is gathered through "session" cookies. We cannot
   relate any of this information back to a specific individual user, and
   the cookie is erased from visitors' systems when they close their
   browsers.

   This general information helps us make our site more useful to
   visitorsÂ—to learn about the amount of visitors to our site and which
   pages are the most popular.

   Information submitted by visitors to us

   If a visitor contacts us by e-mail, we will use the information he or
   she includes only for the purposes provided, and such information will
   not be used after its purpose has been fulfilled.

   For questions on our Web site privacy policy, please contact the Web
   manager.
