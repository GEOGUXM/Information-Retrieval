               Marine, Coastal & Watershed Resource Directory.

   The Directory details educational resources and programs, volunteer
   opportunities and internship possibilities in California that address

   The Directory is a comprehensive guide to marine, coastal and watershed
   organizations in California and the programs and resources they offer.
   The following information is available in the Directory:

   What if I find an error in the Directory?

   If you discover any incorrect information or broken links while using
   the Resource Directory, please send an email or call 1-800-COAST4U.
   Please also contact us if you have any suggestions for improvement, or
   if you know of another organization that should be included.

   How can I get my organization listed?

   If you represent an organization that is interested in being listed in
   the Resource Directory, please complete our survey form in detail to
   provide us with a thorough description of your organization and its
   programs.  The survey is available in both PDF (to print, physically
   write on & return via mail or FAX) and as a Microsoft Word document
   that can be completed on your computer and returned attached to an
   email message.

   To complete the print version:
    1. Print the PDF version. **
    2. Complete the survey.
    3. Mail or FAX it to the California Coastal Commission (the address
       and FAX number are at the bottom of the survey).

   ** This form is available in PDF (portable document format). To print
   it, you need Adobe Acrobat Reader and/or its plug-in for your browser.
   To get the reader, click here, then follow the installation
   instructions.

   To complete the word document to email to us:
    1. Open the document in your word processing program. (It's in RTF,
       rich text format.)
    2. Type the requested information after the ":" colons.
    3. If the question asks you to select one or more of the categories,
       bold those that are applicable to your organization.
    4. Once you have completed the survey, save it as an RTF (rich text
       format) document under your organization’s name- "[insert your
       organization’s name here].rtf"
    5. Email it to ed_directory@coastal.ca.gov

   The information that will appear in the database will be taken directly
   from the surveys.

   Please feel free to pass the survey onto anyone else who might be
   interested in being listed in the directory. With your help, we can
   maintain a current, comprehensive directory of organizations concerned
   with marine, coastal and watershed issues in California.
