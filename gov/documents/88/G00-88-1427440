  Public Disclosure

   In the State Of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is
   open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and
   information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are
   exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve
   various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are
   provided by both state and federal laws.

   Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available
   for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the record
   falls within the specific exemptions of subsection (6) of this section
   [RCW 42.17.260(6)], RCW 42.17.310, 42.17.315, or other statute which
   exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records. To
   the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion of personal
   privacy interests protected by RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315, an agency
   shall delete identifying details in a manner consistent with RCW
   42.17.310 and 42.17.315 when it makes available or publishes any public
   record; however, in each case, the justification for the deletion shall
   be explained fully in writing.

   Information collected at this site become public records that may be
   subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless a specific
   exemption exists. However, the State Library recognizes that privacy of
   inquiry in central to freedom and the success of a democratic society.
   As provided for in RCW 42.17.310 (l), any State Library record, the
   primary purpose of which is to maintain control of library materials,
   or to gain access to information, which discloses or could be used to
   disclose the identity of a library user, is exempt from public
   disclosure. The State Library will not disclose these records, outside
   the requirements of RCW 42.17.310 and absent judicial action to compel
   such disclosure (see also WAC 304-20-060).

   In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Public
   Records Act or other law governing the disclosure of records, the
   Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.
