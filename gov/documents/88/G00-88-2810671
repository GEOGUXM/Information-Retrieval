   Tall Mountain, Tohil Mons, on Io Tall Mountain, Tohil Mons, on Io

   Dramatic shadows across a mountainous landscape on Jupiter's moon Io
   reveal details of the topography around a peak named Tohil Mons in this
   mosaic created from images taken by NASA's Galileo spacecraft in
   October 2001.

   Colorful Tupan Patera, Io Colorful Tupan Patera, Io

   Wonderful colors in a volcanic crater named Tupan Patera on Jupiter's
   moon Io, as seen in this image from NASA's Galileo spacecraft, show
   varied results of lava interacting with sulfur-rich materials.

   Lava Channel at Io's Emakong Patera Lava Channel at Io's Emakong Patera

   Clues about how lava spreads great distances on Jupiter's volcanic moon
   Io come from high-resolution views taken by NASA's Galileo spacecraft
   of a lava channel flowing out of Emakong Patera near Io's equator.

   Io's Tupan Caldera in Infrared

   Tupan Caldera, a volcanic crater on Jupiter's moon Io, has a relatively
   cool area, possibly an island, in its center, as indicated by infrared
   imagery from NASA's Galileo spacecraft.

   A New Hot Spot on Northern Io

   NASA's Galileo spacecraft has returned infrared imagery of a new hot
   spot on Jupiter's moon Io that was the source of a towering plume in
   August 2001, indicating a sulfur-dioxide concentration that may have
   been fallout from the plume.

   Nighttime Temperatures on Southern Io

   Nighttime temperatures in the southern hemisphere of Jupiter's moon Io,
   mapped here with data from NASA's Galileo spacecraft, give hints about
   the textures of surface materials, as well as the locations of volcanic
   hot spots.

   Noise Over Io's North Pole
   QuickTime (5MB)
   Windows Media (1.5MB)
   WAV File (533Kb) Noise Over Io's North Pole

   This graph and accompanying audio file show intense electromagnetic
   wave turbulence associated with a sharp rise, then abrupt drop-off, of
   electron density in a region over the north pole of Jupiter's moon Io.
   The section of increased wave activity beginning about one-third of the
   way from left to right across the graph corresponds to the region of
   higher electron density.

   Noise Over Io's South Pole
   Quicktime Movie (5MB)
   Windows Media (1.5MB)
   WAV File (533Kb) Noise Over Io's South Pole

   This graph and accompanying audio file show intense electromagnetic
   wave turbulence associated with a sharp rise, then abrupt drop-off, of
   electron density in a region over the south pole of Jupiter's moon Io.
   The section of increased wave activity beginning about half way from
   left to right across the graph corresponds to the region of higher
   electron density.
