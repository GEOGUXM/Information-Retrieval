   Missing Children in Washington State: Information Sharing and Public
   Education (#01-12-3901)

   The 1999 Legislature directed the Institute for Public Policy to review
   the procedures established by the Department of Social and Health
   Services (DSHS) to report missing children to the Missing Children
   Clearinghouse (MCC) and any impediments to effective utilization of
   those procedures.  This report also describes the operation of the MCC
   and reviews public education and public awareness regarding missing
   children.  [Kay Knapp - December 2001]

   Child Sexual Abuse Investigations: Testing Documentation Methods
   (#01-01-4102)

   The 1999 Legislature directed the Department of Social and Health
   Services (DSHS) to establish three pilot projects involving child
   sexual abuse investigations.  The Child Protective Services (CPS)
   offices were to use written protocols and test different methods and
   techniques to conduct and preserve interviews with alleged victims of
   child sexual abuse.  This report examines the quality, feasibility,
   utility of interview techniques in each pilot site.  [Lucy Berliner
   with Roxanne Lieb - January 2001]

   Guidelines for Child Sexual Abuse Investigation Protocols (#99-12-4101)

   The 1999 Legislature passed legislation concerning investigations of
   alleged child sexual abuse.  In addition to statutory changes to the
   investigatory process for allegations of child sexual abuse, the law
   established a multidisciplinary group to create statewide guidelines
   for these investigations.  This document details the state guidelines,
   including both minimum state requirements for county protocols and
   advisory comments to guide local decision-making.  Prosecutors are to
   use these guidelines in leading local efforts for county protocols;
   those protocols were put into place July 1, 2000.  [December 1999]

   Protocols and Training Standards:  Investigating Allegations of Child
   Sexual Abuse
   (#97-01-4101)
   A budget proviso in the 1996 supplemental budget directed the
   Washington State Institute for Public Policy to "collect data and
   information from jurisdictions within the state of Washington and
   outside the state of Washington, including other nations, that have
   experience with developing protocols and training standards for
   investigating child sexual abuse." This project incorporated a review
   of the scientific literature, model protocols and standards from other
   states and jurisdictions, and legislation in other states. In addition,
   a panel of state experts visited four counties in the state to observe
   their practices.  [Roxanne Lieb with Lucy Berliner and Patricia Toth -
   January 1997]

   An Examination of Organizational Structure and Programmatic Reform in
   Public Child Protective Services (#96-12-4101)
   This report surveys the 50 states regarding their organization of
   children and family services, then analyzes the responses and
   supplemented information from national sources. In addition, case
   studies are described using five states that have undergone recent
   organizational or programmatic reforms in the area of child protection.
   These states are: Florida, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, and Tennessee.
   [Charles Wilson with Paul Vincent and Ed Lake - December 1996]

   Citizen Review Panels: An Opportunity to Improve Child
   Protection? (#98-12-3901)
   The 1998 Legislature directed this study of citizen review panels for
   child protection.  The Legislature determined that it is "critically
   important to the basic nurture, health and safety of children that the
   state examine a state wide program relating to child abuse and neglect
   that includes citizen review panels" as required by federal law.  This
   study addresses: 1) potential barriers to citizen review panels
   obtaining access to information necessary for them to meet their
   obligations, 2) current Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS)
   committees relating to children, and 3) issues relating to the creation
   of review panels.  [William C. Collins - December 1998]

   Court Appointed Special Advocates for Children in Washington State:  A
   Review of Effectiveness (#98-11-3901)
   The 1997 session of the Washington State Legislature funded an
   evaluation of court-appointed special advocates/guardians ad litem
   (CASA/GALs).  Volunteer CASA advocates operate in 22 of the state's 32
   court jurisdictions, investigating and representing the dependent
   child's perspective in family court.  This evaluation determines the
   effectiveness of the CASA/GAL program in improving outcomes for
   dependent children, and examines cost-effectiveness.  [Lucy Berliner
   with Monica Fitzgerald - November 1998]

   Washington State Child Abuse Reporting Laws:  Summary of Legislative
   Changes, 1965-1996  (#96-10-3901)

   have been amended since 1965. Each legislative change is summarized,
   allowing the reader to view the changes in state policy regarding abuse
   definitions and protected classes of individuals, as well as the

   Lieb - October 1996]

   cases in Washington State between 1991 and 1997.  Information supplied
