   Commercial Vehicle Operations

   Commercial Vehicle ITS applies technologies to help enhance safety and
   simplify credentialing and tax administration, road side enforcement,
   freight and fleet management, and vehicle operations. It also has
   applications to intermodal connections, such as at rail and sea ports,
   and international border crossings.
