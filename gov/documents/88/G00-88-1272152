                   PLANT INFORMATION INTERCHANGE VIA STEP
     __________________________________________________________________

         Information Interchange for All Facets of the Process Plant

   PlantSTEP is an industrial consortium of companies that own, design,
   build, operate and maintain process plants and companies that supply
   equipment, materials and information technology for the process and
   construction industries. The primary focus of PlantSTEP is to develop
   and support implementation of data exchange standards based on
   ISO/STEP. These standards will enable concurrent engineering, design,
   construction, and operation of large facilities by allowing full
   information sharing among all project contributors.
