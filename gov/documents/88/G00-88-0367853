                    Child Support Questions for Individuals

   Updated January 23, 2002

      My ex-spouse owes child support and I have already contacted my state
      child support enforcement agency. Who in the Federal government can I
      contact?

   For information concerning the Child Support Enforcement Program or
   collecting or paying child support see the Department of Health and
   Human Services's web site at www.acf.dhhs.gov/programs/cse/ Exit FMS or
   call their Customer Service Office at 202-401-9373.

      What is the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) and how can it assist me with
      child support payment collection?

   If your ex-spouse is a federal payment recipient, the TOP allows the
   state to offset certain types of federal payments in order to collect
   the delinquent child support owed. Contact your state or local child
   support enforcement office Exit FMS web site to determine whether
   federal payments to your ex-spouse can be offset through TOP.

      My federal payment was reduced two months ago for delinquent child
      support. The state has not received the money. Where is it?

   Funds collected by the Treasury from your federal payment are sent to
   the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the federal liaison
   office with the states on child support enforcement. HHS disburses the
   funds to the states. To obtain information on the status of a support
   payment, you should request the state to contact HHS directly. Exit FMS
