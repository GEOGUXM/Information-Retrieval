     Memorandum 92-6, dated September 15, 1992, section 4.3 (page 5)

   Policies and procedures regarding frosts and freezes are transferred to
   Chapter C-44 from C-42. These events are primarily associated with the
   transition seasons of spring and fall. Therefore, products for frosts
   and freezes should normally be issued by most offices using the AFOS
   category NFW for non-precipitation events. Possible exceptions to this
   category are noted in the next paragraph. All other policies and
   procedures regarding frosts and freezes remain unchanged and are
   included in this OML for convenient reference.

   In tropical or subtropical climatic areas where frosts and freezes are
   rare, these products may still be issued under the AFOS category WSW
   for winter events. This would be appropriate for occurrences in the
   deep South, lower elevations of the southwest deserts, Puerto Rico, and
   lower elevations in Hawaii.

   The Mass News Disseminator for frost and freeze products should be
   FREEZE WARNING, FROST WARNING, and FROST ADVISORY and include the zone
   (Z) form of the Universal Generic Code (see WSOM Chapter C-63). Watches
   for frost or freezes are not issued. Advisories are not issued for
   freezes. If a freeze or a freeze with frost is expected, then a freeze
   warning would be issued. Warnings and advisories for frosts are issued
   at regional option. If a warning is issued for frost, it would be for a
   "killing frost" as defined in the section on frost. See the table below
   of a summary of frost/freeze policy

   Where appropriate, issuance of frost and freeze warnings should be
   coordinated with NWS meteorologists issuing specialized agricultural
   products (WSOM Chapters D-05 and D-40), such as fruit/frost forecasts
   and warnings.

   Freeze. A freeze occurs when the surface air temperature is expected to
   be 32EF or below over a widespread area for a climatologically
   significant period of time. A freeze may or may not be accompanied by
   the formation of frost. Use of the freeze term includes advective
   situations or occasions when wind or other conditions prevent frost.
   Adjectives such as "killing," "severe," or "hard" should be used when
   appropriate. "Killing" may be used during the growing season when the
   temperature is expected to be low enough for a sufficient duration to
   kill all but the hardiest herbaceous crops.

   At regional discretion, a freeze warning may be issued for successive
   evenings (or events) during late spring (beginning of the growing
   season) or if the entire forecast area did not experience a "hard"
   freeze late in the growing season. The freeze condition is generally
   significant only during the growing season except in normally warm
   climatic areas unaccustomed to freezing temperatures (i.e., in the deep
   South where winter freezes often burst water pipes, radiators, etc.).

   NOTE: The term "killing freeze" should only be used once
   during the growing season.

   Frost. Frost describes the formation of thin ice crystals on the ground
   or other surfaces in the form of scales, needles, feathers, or fans.
   Frost develops under conditions similar to dew, except the temperatures
   of the Earth's surface and earthbound objects falls below 32EF. As with
   the term "freeze," this condition is primarily significant during the
   growing season. If a frost period is sufficiently severe to end the
   growing season or delay its beginning, it is commonly referred to as a
   "killing frost." Because frost is primarily an event that occurs as the
   result of radiational cooling, it can occur with standard observing
   level temperature (at 5 feet above ground) in the mid to upper 30's.
