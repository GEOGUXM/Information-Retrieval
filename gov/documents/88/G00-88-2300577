                       Overview of the Governor's Budget

   The 2002-03 Governor's Budget lays out the administration's spending
   priorities and offers a plan for addressing the state's $12-plus
   billion budgetary shortfall. While "on paper" the plan appears to work,
   many of its assumptions are overly optimistic, it relies largely on
   one-time solutions, and it results in substantial long- term out-year
   costs. Moreover, the plan does not resolve the state's budgetary
   imbalance in subsequent years, thereby continuing the risk of future
   shortfalls.

Overview of the Governor's Budget

  Introduction

   The Governor's 2002-03 budget proposes a plan for addressing the
   state's multibillion dollar imbalance between General Fund revenues and
   expenditures. It does this through a variety of actions, including
   spending cuts and deferrals, revenue accelerations, asset sales, and
   loans from special funds. The budget's basic strategy reflects the
   assumption that the current imbalance between revenues and expenditures
   is primarily a temporary one, brought about by a drop in revenues
   resulting from a recession that itself is expected to be mild and
   short-lived. As a consequence, most of the budget's proposed solutions
   involve one-time savings or revenue accelerations, on the theory that
   the improved economic conditions associated with the projected economic
   recovery will keep the budget balanced over the longer term. As
   discussed below, while this strategy has enabled the administration to
   avoid deeper multiyear spending reductions or tax increases, its heavy
   reliance on one-time solutions and certain questionable assumptions
   raises the risk of substantial future budgetary imbalances emerging.

  Total State Spending

   The budget proposes total state spending in 2002-03 of $97.9 billion
   (excluding expenditures of federal funds and selected bond funds). This
   represents a slight decrease of 0.4 percent from the current year.
   About 80 percent of total spending is from the General Fund, while the
   remainder is from special funds.

  General Fund Condition

   Figure 1 shows the General Fund's condition under the budget's
   assumptions and proposals. It shows that in the current year, revenues
   are projected to be $77.1 billion, expenditures are estimated to be
   $78.4 billion, and the year is expected to end with a negligible
   reserve of $12 million. In 2002-03, the budget projects that General
   Fund revenues will total $79.3 billion, an increase of about
   $2.2 billion (2.9 percent) from the current year, while expenditures
   are estimated to be $78.8 billion, a $400 million (0.5 percent)
   increase from the current year. Under the budget proposal, 2002-03
   would end with a budgetary reserve of $511 million.

  How the Budget Addresses the Shortfall

   How Big Is the Problem? The budget identifies a cumulative budget
   shortfall of $12.5 billion in 2002-03, consisting of a current-year
   deficit of $3 billion, a budget-year imbalance between revenues and
   expenditures of about $9 billion, and the need to rebuild the reserve
   of $500 million.

   The amount of the cumulative shortfall identified by the administration
   is similar in overall magnitude to our November projection of a
   $12.4 billion 2002-03 shortfall. However, its components are
   significantly different. Specifically, the administration is
   forecasting about $2 billion more in combined current-year and
   budget-year revenues than we had projected in November. These higher
   revenues are roughly offset, however, by (1) the costs of funding the
   reserve ($500 million) and (2) about $1.5 billion in net increases in
   the administration's definition of baseline expenditures relative to
   the current-law baseline used in our November report.

   Key Solutions. Using the administration's estimate of revenues,
   expenditures, and the budget shortfall as the starting point, the
   budget proposes to close the $12.5 billion funding gap through a
   variety of measures. These are summarized in Figure 2 and include:
     * Spending Reductions ($5.2 Billion). In November, the Governor
       proposed about $2.5 billion in spending reductions (current year
       and budget year combined) from program areas throughout the budget.
       The January budget assumes implementation of these reductions. The
       budget plan also contains an additional $2.7 billion in budget-year
       reductions, including such things as suspensions of cost-of-living
       adjustments (COLAs) in various social services programs,
       postponements of some recent health care expansions, reduced
       inflationary adjustments for higher education, and various other
       program reductions.
     * Fund Shifts ($586 Million). These include shifts of capital outlay
       support from the General Fund to lease-revenue bonds, and various
       spending shifts from the General Fund to special funds.
     * Federal Funding Increases ($1.1 Billion). The budget assumes
       additional federal funds to offset state costs for Medi-Cal,
       undocumented felon incarceration, and security activities. It also
       assumes elimination of federal child support penalties.
     * Revenue Accelerations, Spending Deferrals, Loans, and Transfers
       ($5.6 Billion). About $2.4 billion of this total would come from
       the sale of a revenue bond, which would be paid off using future
       tobacco settlement funds. These funds currently support a variety
       of recently adopted health expansions. Also included in this
       category are payment deferrals to the state teachers' and public
       employees' retirement funds, a loan from the Traffic Congestion
       Relief Fund, and various other special fund loans and transfers.

The Budget's Economic and Revenue Projections

  Economic Assumptions

   Economy Currently in Recession. Both the U.S. and California economies
   currently remain in the midst of a recession that began in the spring
   of 2001. This downturn was primarily caused by two factors:
     * A retrenchment in business investment spending, particularly
       involving high-tech goods and related services.
     * Declining exports to foreign nations, reflecting a weak
       international trade environment.

   These and related factors have led to significant job losses in
   manufacturing in California, beginning in early 2001. This
   manufacturing downturn spread to other areas of the economy in the
   latter half of 2001, especially in the aftermath of the September 11
   terrorist attacks. While recent economic data suggest that the downturn
   is nearing bottom, basic economic conditions remained relatively weak
   as of year end.

   Personal Income Especially Hard Hit. It is important to note that
   California personal income has been especially hard hit during the
   recession, rising by only 1.4 percent in 2001 compared to the nation's
   5 percent gain. This reflects not only the income losses from
   recession-induced job and production cutbacks, but also a dramatic
   reduction in the amount of bonuses and stock options paid by California
   employers.

   Rebound Expected in Spring. The administration's forecast assumes that
   both the U.S. and California economies will stabilize in the first
   quarter of 2002 and then begin a sustained moderate expansion in the
   spring. The key forces behind the recovery forecast are recent interest
   rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, past federal tax reductions and
   spending increases, the observed rebound in consumer and business
   confidence from its post-September 11 low, and recent declines in
   business inventories (which mean that new spending will need to be
   matched by increased production).

   Recovery to Accelerate Through 2003. As shown in Figure 3, California's
   downturn in jobs is expected to be more mild and short-lived than for
   the nation as a whole. The budget projects California wage and salary
   employment to start growing modestly late in the first half of 2002,
   and then steadily accelerate throughout the year's second half and
   thereafter. For 2003, job growth is projected to be a respectable
   2.4 percent.

   Although the state also is projected to experience moderate personal
   income growth in 2002 and 2003 on a par with the nation, this growth
   will be on a significantly reduced base given the dramatic 2001 falloff
   in bonuses and stock options. These two income sources will remain well
   below their previous levels. This, in conjunction with the reduced
   level of capital gains (which are not a part of personal income but
   nevertheless are taxed), will adversely affect income tax revenues.

  Revenue Outlook

   Revenues to Fall in 2001-02, Rebound in 2002-03. The budget forecasts
   that total General Fund revenues and transfers will grow from
   $71.4 billion in 2000-01 to $77.1 billion in 2001-02 and $79.3 billion
   in 2002-03. Numerous policy-related factors are embedded in these
   figures. These include:
     * A transfer out of the General Fund of $6.2 billion in 2000-01
       related to loans to the Department of Water Resources' Electric
       Power Fund.
     * An offsetting transfer back into the General Fund of $6.5 billion
       in 2001-02 reflecting repayment of and interest on these
       electricity loans, financed from an assumed electricity revenue
       bond sale in June 2002.
     * A $2.4 billion transfer into the General Fund in 2002-03 associated
       with the administration's tobacco settlement securitization
       proposal.
     * Numerous other transfers and loans to the General Fund from special
       funds during the three years.
     * A net 2002-03 revenue gain of $180 million associated with various
       tax-related changes proposed in the budget (discussed below).

   Eliminating the distorting effects of these factors, underlying General
   Fund revenues are projected to decline by 9.4 percent in the current
   year and increase by a moderate 7.2 percent in 2002-03.

   Revenue Estimate Is Far Above November Legislative Analyst's Office
   Projection. After adjusting for differences in policy assumptions, the
   2002-03 budget revenue forecast is above our November projections by
   $1.7 billion in 2001-02 and about $300 million in 2002-03. While the
   administration's underlying assumptions for most economic and revenue
   variables are either similar to or slightly more conservative than our
   November figures, the administration is far more optimistic than us
   with regard to personal income tax (PIT) receipts.

   Stock Options and Capital Gains Are the Issue. The budget's higher PIT
   forecast is due to its more optimistic assumptions about the stock
   market. As shown in Figure 4, the budget forecasts that income from
   stock options and capital gains will fall from $197 billion in 2000 to
   $105 billion in 2001a decline of 47 percentbefore growing slightly to
   $108 billion in 2002. In contrast, our November forecast assumes that
   the decline will be an even steeper 60 percent in 2001to
   $82 billionbefore rebounding by 15 percent (to $94 billion) in 2002.
   The difference in these assumptions translates into about $2 billion in
   PIT revenues in 2001-02 and about $1.3 billion in 2002-03, thus more
   than explaining our total revenue difference.


   [fig_4.gif]


   Administration Overly Optimistic. Weak year-end receipts from PIT
   taxpayers suggest that revenues from capital gains and options are
   below our November estimates, and thus, significantly weaker than the
   administration's higher projections. If recent negative collection
   trends continue, 2001-02 revenues could fall below the budget forecast
   by $3 billion or more.

   Over the next month, we will be monitoring economic and revenue trends,
   and will incorporate these and other factors into our updated revenue
   projections in our publication entitled The 2002-03 Budget:
   Perspectives and Issues.

The Governor's Major Proposals By Program Area

   Figure 5 shows the budget's proposed General Fund spending by major
   program areas for 2000-01 through 2002-03. It indicates that:
     * K-12 Education. Total General Fund spending for K-12 education
       remains essentially flat, growing by 1.1 percent in 2002-03. This
       reflects a very small increase in the Proposition 98 minimum
       funding guarantee (2.2 percent, most of which is funded by growth
       in property tax revenues).
     * Medi-Cal. This shows a 3.8 percent increase due in part to recent
       policy decisions to expand eligibility. This increase is offset by
       several spending reductions, including reforms in the way drugs are
       purchased and provided to patients, cuts in provider rates, and
       establishment of copayments for certain patients.
     * Social Services. California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to
       Kids (CalWORKs) shows an increase of 6.7 percent, with total
       funding equaling the minimum level required by federal law. The
       Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Program (SSI/SSP)
       also shows an increase in the budget year (8.1 percent) mainly due
       to prior-year COLA adjustments and 2 percent caseload growth.
     * Youth and Adult Corrections This shows a decline of 1.8 percent in
       the budget year, primarily reflecting declining inmate and ward
       caseloads.
     * Other Programs. These show a collective decline of 1.7 percent,
       reflecting reductions in resources and environmental protection, as
       well as in general government programs.

  K-12 Education

   Proposition 98 allocations to K-12 schools (which include local
   property tax revenues) total $41.2 billion in 2002-03. This represents
   an increase of $1.2 billion, or 3.1 percent, over the Governor's
   current-year estimate. This current-year estimate includes significant
   reductions proposed by the Governor in November. Relative to the level
   of funding approved in the 2001-02 Budget Act, the proposed spending
   level for 2002-03 represents an increase of $734 million, or
   1.8 percent. The budget proposes Proposition 98 resources of $7,058 per
   pupil for 2002-03. This represents an increase of 2 percent relative to
   the revised current-year estimate and 0.8 percent relative to the
   2001-02 Budget Act amount.

   The budget proposes Proposition 98 spending equal to the minimum
   funding requirement. Within this amount, the budget provides
   $843 million for a 2.15 percent COLA for revenue limits and most
   categorical programs. The budget also provides $438 million for
   statutory growth, based on projected statewide attendance growth of
   1.07 percent. The combined amounts for COLAs and statutory growth
   exceeds the total increase in Proposition 98 funds by about
   $60 million.

   In addition, the budget proposes several program augmentations and also
   provides ongoing funds for various programs funded in the current year
   with one-time monies. To bridge the resulting funding gap, the budget
   for K-12 education depends on current-year and budget-year reductions
   to various existing programs.

   Budget Risk Associated With Proposition 98. The minimum funding
   requirement for Proposition 98 programs in 2002-03 will depend largely
   on an estimate of the change in California personal income that itself
   will depend on an index of personal income to be published by the
   federal government in April or May 2002. (The use of this federal index
   is specified by state law.) The administration's estimate of the
   minimum funding requirement for Proposition 98 for 2002-03 assumes an
   estimated decline in California per-capita personal income of
   approximately 3 percent. In our November report, we forecast a
   1 percent decline, and placed a 3 percent decline at the low end of a
   range of probable outcomes. If the federal government index is
   consistent with our 1 percent forecast, the General Fund would have to
   provide an additional $935 million for Proposition 98 programs in the
   budget year. (Each percentage point change in this factor means a
   General Fund change of almost $470 million.)

   Concerns Regarding Current-Year K-12 Reductions. We also have concerns
   about the following three reductions proposed by the Governor for
   current-year K-12 education programs, totaling almost $143 million:
     * Per-pupil block grant ($68 million).
     * Revenue limit equalization ($40 million).
     * Revenue limits: Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) offset
       ($35 million).

   School districts are well into the current fiscal year, having budgeted
   existing core programs on the assumed receipt of the above funds. Thus,
   loss of these funds could affect existing school operations and/or
   school district operating reserves. Moreover, the proposed budget plan
   does not utilize these three reductions for the purpose of addressing
   the General Fund's budget shortfall. Instead, it retains the
   $143 million in a special account (the Proposition 98 Reversion
   Account) and proposes to spend the freed-up funds on new one-time K-12
   proposals. In our December report, Addressing the State's Fiscal
   Problems, we identified many alternative possibilities for current-year
   General Fund savings in K-12 education.

  Higher Education

   Community Colleges. The budget proposes $4.7 billion in Proposition 98
   funding for California Community Colleges. This represents an increase
   of 3 percent over the current year. The increase includes support for
   3 percent growth in enrollment and a 2.15 percent COLA. The budget
   makes reductions in various categorical programs and proposes some
   increases in spending to backfill ongoing programs that were funded
   with one-time funds in the current year. The General Fund component of
   Proposition 98 funding is reduced by 0.4 percent due to an anticipated
   increase in local property taxes.

   University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU).
   Here, the budget proposal includes a combined 2002-03 General Fund
   reduction of 1 percent, comprised of a 2.5 percent reduction for UC and
   an increase of about 1 percent for CSU. These budgets support a
   1.5 percent general increase and 3.9 percent enrollment growth for both
   UC and CSU. Funding is also included for increased state support of
   summer instruction and one-time funds to recruit faculty for UC Merced.
   In addition, reductions are proposed in various outreach and technology
   programs. The UC budget shows a reduction in the budget year due to the
   volume of one-time capital outlay projects in the current year.

  State Retirement Contributions

   The Governor's budget proposes to postpone payment of the state's
   retirement contributions to the PERS and the State Teachers' Retirement
   System (STRS) in exchange for the administration's support of
   particular retirement benefit increases. The administration has
   indicated that it will reassess these proposals for the May Revision in
   light of the state revenue picture at that time.

   Public Employees' Retirement System. The PERS board has lowered the
   state contribution rates for the current and budget years by
   recognizing past investment returns more quickly. This results in a
   total General Fund savings of $496 million for state ($371 million) and
   nonteaching school employees ($125 million) in 2002-03. The state would
   have otherwise realized these savings in future years. As a result, the
   state would make up these lower contributions over 30 years by paying
   about $30 million to $40 million per year. These contributions would
   increase thereafter with the growth in payroll.

   In exchange for lowering the state's retirement contributions, the
   administration has agreed to support legislation that increases
   payments to retirees to provide purchasing power protection at
   80 percent instead of 75 percent of the initial pension amount
   effective January 1, 2005. This would increase the state's General Fund
   retirement contributions by about $100 million annually for 20 years to
   pay for the unfunded cost of providing this benefit for state and
   school service already rendered. (These costs total $1.1 billion in
   today's dollars.) Additionally, beginning in 2006-07, the state's
   annual retirement contribution would be higher by an undetermined
   amount to pay for the cost of providing this benefit on an ongoing
   basis.

   State Teachers' Retirement System. The provisions of the STRS agreement
   have not been finalized. Under the current tentative agreement, the
   state would not pay eight quarters of its contributions for retirement
   benefits. This results in current-year and budget-year General Fund
   savings of $508 million. The state would make up these payments by
   increasing the state's contribution to STRS in the future. In exchange,
   the administration has agreed to support an as-yet-undetermined
   increase in benefits.

  Other Programs

   Medi-Cal. The budget proposes $10.1 billion in funding for Medi-Cal in
   2002-03, an increase of 3.8 percent above the proposed current-year
   spending level of $9.7 billion. These figures do not take into account
   an assumption in the budget plan that the state will receive
   $400 million in federal financial relief in the current year to offset
   a formula-driven reduction in the federal share of cost for support of
   the program.

   The Medi-Cal budget reflects an increase of about 300,000 eligibles, or
   4.9 percent, in the budget year. This is primarily as a result of
   recent policy decisions to expand eligibility and to make it easier to
   sign up and keep beneficiaries enrolled in the program. The spending
   level also reflects proposals for certain spending reductions,
   including reforms in the way drugs are purchased and provided to
   patients ($100 million), cuts in provider rates ($78 million), and
   establishment of copayments for certain patients ($31 million).

   Other Health Programs. The budget assumes that expansion of the Healthy
   Families Program to parents, initially slated to start in the current
   fiscal year, will be postponed until 2003-04. The line-up of health
   programs supported from the new Tobacco Settlement Fund is proposed to
   change significantly, and about $62 million of the funds anticipated in
   the budget year will be diverted to pay the debt-service costs of a
   bond that will allow the state to accelerate its collection of
   $2.4 billion from this source. (In future years, the annual amounts
   diverted for debt-service payments will increase to $190 million.) The
   budget plan would also eliminate the Child Health and Disability
   Prevention program and shift eligible children to Medi-Cal, the Healthy
   Families Program, and the Expanded Access to Primary Care community
   clinics program. Significant reductions are also proposed for local
   assistance programs for the mentally ill, persons with drug and alcohol
   problems, and the developmentally disabled.

   Social Services. The budget proposes to suspend statutory COLAs for
   CalWORKs and SSI/SSP, and does not provide the discretionary COLA for
   Foster Care and related programs. This results in a General Fund
   savings of $273 million. The budget also provides no inflation
   adjustment for county administration of CalWORKs, Foster Care, or Food
   Stamps, resulting in savings of $57 million. In order to maintain
   CalWORKs General Fund spending at the minimum level required by federal
   law, the budget proposes to redirect $189 million in county performance
   incentives to fund basic CalWORKs grants and services. Finally, the
   budget assumes General Fund savings of $226 million from federal law
   changes that (1) eliminate the federal child support automation penalty
   ($181 million) and (2) restore federal Food Stamp eligibility for
   noncitizens currently served in a state-only program ($35 million).

   Child Care. The Governor proposes to reform California's subsidized
   child care system by modifying current eligibility rules, reimbursement
   rate limits, and family fees. Specifically, the proposal would
   eliminate eligibility for 13-year old children, reduce reimbursement
   rates, and increase fees for higher-income families. Additionally,
   former CalWORKs recipients would no longer be automatically eligible
   for child care services. The Governor proposes to reinvest the
   resulting savings, thereby increasing the availability of subsidized
   child care for approximately 100,000 children.

   Youth and Adult Corrections. The budget proposes reduced General Fund
   spending for the California Department of Corrections and the
   Department of the Youth Authority due to reduced inmate and ward
   populations, respectively. In addition, the budget proposes savings
   from deactivating some community correctional facilities and shifting
   General Fund support for some programs to Workforce Investment Act
   funds. The budget also assumes that an additional $50 million in
   federal funds for undocumented felons will offset General Fund costs in
   the budget year.

   Transportation. The budget proposes to loan $672 million from the
   Transportation Congestion Relief Fund (TCRF) to the General Fund. This
   amount is in addition to the $238 million transferred in the current
   year from the TCRF to the General Fund. The budget anticipates that the
   General Fund will repay the TCRF loans over a three-year period
   beginning in 2003-04.

   As originally established in 2000, the TCRF received $2 billion from
   the General Fund in 2000-01, including $1.6 billion to fund 141
   specific projects. The budget estimates that expenditures for these
   projects will total $820 million in 2002-03. In order to both make the
   General Fund loan and at the same time pay for the estimated project
   expenditures, the budget proposes to backfill the TCRF with
   $474 million from the State Highway Account (SHA). The SHA funds would
   be freed up, in part, by deferring their use for toll bridge seismic
   retrofit in the current and budget years. Rather, the budget proposes
   to issue $210 million of short-term bonds to fund anticipated toll
   bridge seismic retrofit expenditures in 2002-03.

   Local Government. The budget does not change major local government
   revenues, including the property tax and vehicle license fee. Existing
   criminal justice grant programs, such as the Citizens' Option for
   Public Safety and technology grant programs, are continued. Certain
   proposals of the Governor regarding state-county health and social
   services programs may increase county costs.

   Capital Outlay. The budget includes $2 billion for capital outlay
   projects, of which the vast majority are financed from bonds. Included
   in this total is over $670 million in new lease-revenue bonds, which
   are part of the Governor's Economic Stimulus Package to accelerate new
   public works projects. Direct General Fund appropriations for capital
   outlay total $66 million, and are for funding projects at various
   correctional institutions, and new armories and other projects for the
   Military Department.

  Tax-Related Proposals

   The budget proposes that the state conform to the recently enacted
   federal increases in retirement fund contribution limits. It also would
   increase, from 80 percent up to the federal requirement of 90 percent,
   the amount of annual tax liabilities that must be paid in the form of
   withholding and estimated tax payments. Finally, it would require that
   corporations elect the same corporate tax status on both state and
   federal returns. The net impact of these measures is a revenue gain of
   $180 million in 2002-03, revenue reductions of about $59 million in
   2003-04, and $75 million in 2004-05.

Considerations For The Legislature

   As it reviews the Governor's budgetary proposals in the coming months,
   the Legislature may find it helpful to focus on several key
   budget-related considerations. Specifically, there are several
   principles that merit attention in crafting an overall budget solution.
   As discussed in our recent report entitled Addressing the State's
   Fiscal Problem, these are:
     * A wide range of alternative individual budget solutions should be
       considered.
     * The out-year repercussions of solutions should be assessed.
     * Individual solutions should "make sense" and not be
       counterproductive.
     * Current-year solutions should play a key role.

   Focusing on these principles will help ensure that the overall budget
   solution ultimately adopted will both (1) reflect the Legislature's
   priorities and (2) be effective from both a near-term and longer-term
   perspective.

  How Does the Governor's Plan "Stack Up?"

   We will be reviewing and evaluating the various elements of the
   Governor's plan in the weeks to come and presenting our findings in our
   February Analysis of the 2002-03 Budget Bill. However, several things
   immediately stand out about the plan that will merit the Legislature's
   attention.

   Budget Plan Contains Numerous Risks. The budget proposal for dealing
   with the shortfall contains a number of optimistic assumptions that are
   subject to considerable risk. These risks fall into several key areas:
     * Revenues. As noted previously, we believe that revenues are likely
       to be substantially below the administration's forecast due to its
       optimistic assumptions regarding stock options and capital gains.
     * Federal Funds. While it is likely the state will receive some
       additional federal support, it is unlikely to meet expectations.
     * Proposition 98. The minimum funding requirement could prove to be
       up to $900 million above the budget forecast.

   In addition, the General Fund faces a cash-flow risk associated with
   the assumed repayment of the $6-plus billion in General Fund loans to
   the Electric Power Fund. The revenue bond sale to finance the repayment
   cannot occur until certain issues are resolved affecting its
   marketability.

   Budget Plan Does Not Eliminate Out-Year Deficits. In our November
   report, we indicated that the state faces both a near-term budget
   shortfall and an ongoing operating deficit (that is, expenditures in
   excess of revenues). The latter, if not addressed, will result in large
   budget deficits in future years.

   The Governor's plan does not address this out-year problem. This is
   because it relies heavily on one-time as opposed to multiyear
   solutions. Indeed, many of the budget's proposals, such as the
   securitization of future tobacco settlement revenues, the delay in
   retirement fund contributions, and the borrowings from special funds,
   would increase out-year expenditures and thus, aggravate the
   already-projected future imbalances between revenues and expenditures.

   As a result, even though the year-end 2002-03 budget would be balanced
   under the Governor's assumptions, we estimate that an operating deficit
   of nearly $4 billion would emerge in 2003-04. Thus, it is important
   that the Legislature weigh the future costs of the Governor's proposed
   deferrals against these near-term benefits.

   Additional Solutions Should Be Considered. Given the above, and the
   risks inherent in the Governor's plan, an important legislative
   consideration is what additional budget-related solutions should be
   adopted to ensure that a balanced budget is both achieved in the near
   term and maintained in the future.
