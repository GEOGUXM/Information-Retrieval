   Take our survey!

    Ten million Americans have already suffered irreversible damage from
   noise, and thirty million more are exposed to dangerous levels of noise
                                  each day.

   The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
   (NIDCD), in partnership with the National Institute of Occupational
   Safety and Health (NIOSH), are joined by a coalition of national,
   regional, and local organizations, voluntaries, and state and local
   government agencies in a national campaign to prevent noise-induced
   hearing loss called WISE EARS!

   The objectives of the coalition are to:
     * Increase awareness about noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) among
       all audiences, e.g., workers, employees, health professionals,
       teachers, parents, children, entertainment industry, unions,
       industry, state and local government workers, and the general
       public.
     * Motivate all audiences to take action against NIHL by understanding
       the problem and its solutions, e.g., understanding that everyone is
       at risk for NIHL; expanding the availability of hearing protection
       devices; advocating changes in the workplace; developing hearing
       loss prevention programs.
