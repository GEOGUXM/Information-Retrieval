   LIST OF LEXIS, WESTLAW, & INTERNET FILES New members of the Court staff
   get fresh versions of the Lexis, WestLaw and Internet software, without
   any embedded or favorite files. This is a list of those files which are
   most likely to be used for your official duties: {NOTE: The Court now
   uses LEXIS.COM, instead of Lexis application software. The filenames
   used here for Lexis & WestLaw are from the application software; on the
   internet versions the same files can be found by selecting from their
   lists of database files. While WESTLAW.COM (and the WestLaw application
   software) keep a list of Favorite files, LEXIS.COM keeps a list of the
   last 20 files you used. When using LEXIS.COM and WESTLAW.COM, remember
   that the typeface and margins are controlled by your internet browser
   settings.} LEXIS WESTLAW INTERNET Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims,
