SUMMARY OF TROPICAL CYCLONE ACTIVITY FOR SEPTEMBER 2001...

FOR THE EASTERN NORTH PACIFIC...EAST OF 140 DEGREES WEST
LONGITUDE...

FIVE TROPICAL STORMS DEVELOPED IN SEPTEMBER.  THREE OF THEM BECAME
HURRICANES.

FLOSSIE...A FORMER HURRICANE...WAS A WEAK TROPICAL STORM EARLY ON
THE 1ST...WHEN IT WAS LOCATED ABOUT 600 NAUTICAL MILES(N MI)WEST OF
CABO SAN LUCAS MEXICO.  FLOSSIE MOVED SLOWLY NORTHEASTWARD OVER
COLDER WATER...WEAKENED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION...AND DISSIPATED ON
THE 2ND.  MOISTURE FROM FLOSSIE WAS ADVECTED NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS
SOUTHWEST CALIFORNIA AND HELPED TRIGGER FLOOD-PRODUCING HEAVY RAINS
AND DEADLY CLOUD-TO-GROUND LIGHTNING.  FOUR PEOPLE WERE STRUCK BY
LIGHTNING IN THE SAN DIEGO AND SAN BERNARDINO MOUNTAINS ON THE 2ND
AND 3RD...KILLING A 53-YR OLD MAN AND A 13-YR OLD BOY.  THESE ARE
CONSIDERED INDIRECT DEATHS...SINCE FLOSSIE WAS NO LONGER A TROPICAL
CYCLONE WHEN THEY OCCURRED.

GIL WAS NOTABLE FOR ITS INTERACTION WITH...AND EVENTUAL ABSORPTION
OF...HENRIETTE.  IT FIRST FORMED AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION ABOUT 845
N MI SOUTHWEST OF CABO SAN LUCAS ON THE 4TH.  THE CYCLONE MOVED
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD AND REACHED TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH LATER THAT
DAY.  A SLOW WEST-SOUTHWESTWARD MOTION OCCURRED ON THE 5TH AND
6TH...WITH GIL REACHING HURRICANE STRENGTH AND A PEAK INTENSITY OF
85 KNOTS ON THE 6TH.  GIL TURNED NORTH-NORTHWEST AND WEAKENED ON THE
7TH...AND THIS MOTION CONTINUED INTO THE 8TH AS GIL WEAKENED TO A
TROPICAL STORM.  LATER ON THE 8TH AND 9TH...GIL TURNED NORTHWEST...
WEST...AND SOUTHWEST AS IT ROTATED AROUND HENRIETTE.  GIL WEAKENED
TO A DEPRESSION DURING THE ROTATION...AND THEN WEAKENED TO A REMNANT
LOW LATE ON THE 9TH ABOUT 925 N MI EAST OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.

HENRIETTE DEVELOPED INTO A DEPRESSION ON THE 4TH ABOUT 430 N MI
SOUTH OF CABO SAN LUCAS MEXICO.  THE CYCLONE TRACKED
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD THROUGHOUT ITS LIFETIME AND DID NOT AFFECT LAND.
HENRIETTE BECAME A TROPICAL STORM EARLY ON THE 5TH AND PEAKED AT 55
KNOTS EARLY ON THE 7TH.  STEADY WEAKENING BEGAN LATER THAT DAY AS
THE SYSTEM MOVED OVER COOLER WATER.  HENRIETTE WEAKENED TO A
TROPICAL DEPRESSION AND DISSIPATED ON THE 8TH AS IT WAS ABSORBED BY
THE CIRCULATION OF GIL ABOUT 1300 N MI EAST OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.

IVO BECAME A DEPRESSION ON THE 10TH ABOUT 150 N MI SOUTH OF ACAPULCO
MEXICO AND BECAME A TROPICAL STORM LATER THAT DAY.  IT MOVED
GENERALLY NORTHWESTWARD...PARALLEL TO AND 100-150 N MI OFFSHORE OF
THE COAST OF MEXICO.  IVO SPREAD HEAVY RAINS OVER THE MAINLAND OF
MEXICO AND SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA.  IT REACHED ITS PEAK INTENSITY
OF 45 KNOTS ON THE 12TH AND 13TH.  IT DISSIPATED ON THE 14TH
ABOUT 275 N MI WEST OF CABO SAN LUCAS.

JULIETTE FORMED FROM THE REMNANT DISTURBANCE OF ATLANTIC TROPICAL
DEPRESSION NINE WHICH MOVED ACROSS CENTRAL AMERICA ON THE 19TH AND
20TH.  IT BECAME A TROPICAL STORM ON THE 21ST WHILE CENTERED ABOUT
175 N MI SOUTH OF THE GULF OF TEHUANTEPEC.  THE STORM MOVED
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD PARALLEL TO AND ABOUT 150-200 N MI OFFSHORE OF
THE COAST OF MEXICO.  JULIETTE BECAME A HURRICANE ON THE 23RD AND
RAPIDLY INTENSIFIED TO 125 KNOTS...A CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE...ON THE
24TH WHILE LOCATED ABOUT 250 N MI SOUTH-SOUTHEAST OF MANZANILLO.
JULIETTE REMAINED NEAR CATEGORY 4 INTENSITY...WITH SOME FLUCTUATION
IN WIND SPEED...FOR ABOUT THREE DAYS.  AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE
AIRCRAFT MEASURED A MINIMUM SEA LEVEL PRESSURE OF 923 MB IN JULIETTE
ON THE 25TH...THE SECOND-LOWEST MEASURED PRESSURE ON RECORD FOR THE
EAST PACIFIC.  ON THE 26TH-27TH...THE HURRICANE TURNED NORTHWESTWARD
THEN NORTHWARD WHILE SLOWLY WEAKENING.  JULIETTE MOVED NEAR THE
SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA PENINSULA ON THE 28TH THROUGH THE
30TH...CAUSING HURRICANE FORCE WINDS...HEAVY RAINS...AND BATTERING
WAVES FOR ABOUT 36 HOURS.  WEAKENING TO A DEPRESSION...IT MOVED
NORTHWARD ACROSS BAJA CALIFORNIA AND OVER NORTHWEST MAINLAND MEXICO
WHERE IT DISSIPATED AT 0000 UTC 1 OCT.  ITS RAINS SPREAD INLAND
ACROSS NORTHWEST MEXICO AND INTO THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES.
ONE SURFING-RELATED DROWNING DEATH WAS REPORTED FROM BAJA CALIFORNIA
AND A FISHERMAN DROWNED NEAR ACAPULCO WHEN HIGH SEAS CAPSIZED HIS
SMALL BOAT.

KIKO FORMED EARLY ON THE 22ND ABOUT 720 N MI SOUTHWEST OF CABO SAN
LUCAS AND STRENGTHENED TO A TROPICAL STORM THE SAME DAY.  KIKO MOVED
ON A WEST-NORTHWEST TO WESTWARD HEADING DURING ITS EXISTENCE.  IT
STRENGTHENED TO A HURRICANE ON THE 23RD...BUT A STEADY WEAKENING
TREND BEGAN THE NEXT DAY.  THE SYSTEM DISSIPATED ABOUT 1700 N MI
EAST OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS ON THE 25TH...BUT ITS REMNANT LOW COULD
BE TRACKED AS IT MOVED SLOWLY WESTWARD FOR SEVERAL MORE DAYS.
