                      The USGS Volcano Hazards Program
   Overview
   USGS has the responsibility to issue timely warnings of potential
   volcanic disasters to civil authorities and affected communities under
   the auspices of the Stafford Act (Public Law 93-288)
   Accordingly, the mission of the program is to:
     * assess hazards at volcanoes and monitor volcanic unrest
     * conduct research to understand volcanic processes
     * communicate scientific findings to authorities and to the public
     * provide warning information on volcanic activity
     * respond to volcanic crises
     * help mitigate the harmful effects of volcanic activity

   In short, the USGS Volcano Hazards Program mission is to prevent
   volcano hazards from becoming volcano disasters
   Modified from: Priorities of the Volcano Hazard Program 1999-2003

   awakening volcano at the invitation of a foreign government. VDAP is
   the only rapid-response volcano crisis team in the world.
