                               Issues/Comments

   The Recycling Committee received many other comments and concerns on
   various issues. Issues such as:

   Q: Why does MSFC use non-CFC polystyrene containers in the cafeterias?
   A: The MSFC Recycling Committee identified the original stryene food
   containers as having CFCs. The cafeteria responsed by changing to clear
   plastic food containers. Customers expressed the container adversely
   affected the food quality. The cafeteria found the current non-CFC
   polystyrene containers which incinerate completely in the Hunstville
   Incerations Facility.

   Q: Why doesn't MSFC recycle more items like magazines, newspapers,
   cardboard, and batteries?
   A: Cardboard and automobile batteries are collected items at MSFC.
   However, at this time there is only one cardboard collection bin
   located on the south side of building 4471. Anyone can place cardboard
   containers in the bin. Please clean any cardboard of food debris BEFORE
   putting in this collection bin. Future resources are tagged to purchase
   additional cardboard dumpsters for more sites around MSFC.

   Magazines and newspapers are collected in local curbside recycling
   programs. This items are good materials for future additions to
   Marshall's program. Logistics and implementation would need to be
   formulated. Either central locations or additional bins in various
   locations.

   Q: How can I get additional collection bins?
   A: (answer to follow shortly)

   Q: Why does Marshall recylce empty toner cartridges and does it really
   save money?
   A: (answer to follow shortly)

   Q: What are the phone numbers to call for collection bins/pickup?
   A: (answer to follow shortly)

   Q: Can't we have collection bins on-site at Marshall for bringing your
   recyclable items from home especially for employees whose civic areas
   don't have recycling programs?
   A: This is a good idea and the Recycling Committee will investigate the
   possiblities. This effort would most likely be coordinated through the
   NASA/Marshall Exchange.

   Q: During the STS-75 mission we had to throw our white paper in the
   trash. Why are blue bins absent from the POCC?
   A: The original attempt to place recycling blue bins in the POCC
   required the bins to certified by the faciltiy manager for ?? The blue
   bins were not certified and therefore not allowed in the POCC.

   Q: Why is it people put trash in the blue collection bins and recycled
   materials in the trash?
   A: Misuse of the recycling blue bins for trash has been a problem from
   the beginning of the Recycling Program. It's a matter of respect for
   the Recycling Program and what it is trying to achieve. Correcting this
   problem requires behavior modification of everyone's part. It is the
   same behavior modification correction to get people to STOP throwing
   trash and rubbage on the highways and roadways.

   Q: Why not use the electronic method to disseminate information to the
   Marshall community?
   A: Of the 5,911 on-site employees approximately 3,000 have access to
   E-Mail. While this is the best possible media for dissemination, often
   it does not reach a significant majority of our work force.
   Additionally, a greater number of responses to surveys such as "What
   Recycling Means to Me" are retrieved when the survey is solicited by
   paper rather than electronic mail.

   For more information on the Marshall Recycling Program, this survey, or
