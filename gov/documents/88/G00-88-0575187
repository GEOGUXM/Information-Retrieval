                               Ocean Dynamics

                                [3dline.gif]

     WHY? NOAA is increasingly monitoring ocean circulation and dynamics
     by means of remote sensors that probe its surface from ships,
     aircraft, and satellites. [waves.jpg] Inferring underlying dynamics
     from the surface properties revealed by radars, radiometers, and
     lidars requires fundamental advances in our understanding of the
     surface manifestations of subsurface processes. One example is the
     way internal waves and long surface waves (swell) modify the spectra
     of the short surface waves with which these sensors interact.
     Without such understanding, the sensors could give incorrect
     information about the motions of cold and warm currents, the
     transport of nutrients and pollutants, and air-sea interactions that
     affect the weather.

     The Environmental Technology Laboratory combines theoretical studies
     with laboratory modeling and field experiments to make headway on
     this extremely complex problem.

  Theoretical Studies

     [fig9_100.jpg] Nonstandard models are needed to describe wave
     interactions, and such models are already being developed at ETL
     using both analytical and numerical methods. We have developed a
     theory of strong internal solitons that shows better agreement with
     observations than the commonly used model equations. A new numerical
     algorithm has been developed to simulate this class of processes.
     (Click on image to see a comparison of new and old models with
     data.) For surface waves, we have made considerable progress in
     describing the modulation of short gravity-capillary waves by long
     waves in the presence of turbulent wind. In connection with
     laboratory experiments, a theory of interactions between internal
     waves, currents and small-scale turbulence has been constructed.

  Laboratory Modeling

     [8bigt3_200.jpg] ETL is also collaborating with the Institute of
     Applied Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Nizhni Novgorod,
     Russia) which has created a unique laboratory complex including two
     thermostratified tanks, the larger being of 20x4x2 m size, and a
     closed wind-wave channel. The big tank is equipped to simulate a
     number of processes in the ocean with a scaling of about 1:100 in
     size and 1:10 in velocity. Some unique experimental data have
     already been obtained using these laboratory facilities, regarding
     the distribution of curvatures of surface gravity waves with their
     signs, evolution of short surface wave packets, redistribution of
     surface wave amplitudes over an obstacle, and damping of internal
     and surface waves by turbulence.

  Field Experiments

     [fig6_100.jpg] The Coastal Ocean Probing Experiment (COPE) was
     performed in the fall of 1995 by ETL in collaboration with other
     institutions, including the Naval Postgraduate School (Monterey, CA)
     and the Institute of Ocean Sciences (Sidney, B.C., Canada).
     Extremely strong tidally-generated internal waves in the form of
     groups of solitary waves (solitons) were observed, and they provided
     a strong modulation of radar signals. Time series of isotherms made
     at FLIP show thermocline undulations with tidal periods, as well as
     embedded shorter-period internal-wave fluctuations. (Click on image

     Many of these problems (especially those arising from the COPE data)
     are being intensely analyzed right now and are expected to
     significantly improve our understanding of environmental processes
     in shelf zones and the upper ocean.
