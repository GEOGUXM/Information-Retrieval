   on Using In Vitro Data to Estimate In Vivo Starting Doses for Acute
   Toxicity Based on Recommendations from an International Workshop
   Organized by the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation
   of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) and the National Toxicology Program
   (NTP) Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative
   Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) National Institute of Environmental
   Health Sciences National Institutes of Health U.S. Public Health
   Service Department of Health and Human Services THE INTERAGENCY
   COORDINATING COMMITTEE ON THE VALIDATION OF ALTERNATIVE METHODS AND THE
   NTP INTERAGENCY CENTER FOR THE EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVE TOXICOLOGICAL
   METHODS The Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of
   Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) was established in 1997 by the Director of
   the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) to
   implement NIEHS directives in Public Law 103-43. P.L. 103-43 directed
   NIEHS to develop and validate new test methods, and to establish
   criteria and processes for the validation and regulatory acceptance of
   toxicological testing methods. P. L. 106-545, the ICCVAM Authorization
   Act of 2000, established ICCVAM as a permanent committee. The Committee
   is composed of representatives from 15 Federal regulatory and research
   agencies and programs that generate, use, or provide information from
   toxicity test methods for risk assessment purposes. The Committee
   coordinates cross-agency issues relating to development, validation,
   acceptance, and national/international harmonization of toxicological
   test methods. The National Toxicology Program Interagency Center for
   the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (Center) was
   established in 1998 to provide operational support for the ICCVAM, and
   to carry out committee- related activities such as peer reviews and
   workshops for test methods of interest to Federal agencies. The Center
   and ICCVAM coordinate the scientific review of the validation status of
   proposed methods and provide recommendations regarding their usefulness
   to appropriate agencies. The NTP Center and ICCVAM seek to promote the
   validation and regulatory acceptance of toxicological test methods that
   will enhance agencies' abilities to assess risks and make decisions,
   and that will refine, reduce, and replace animal use. The ultimate goal
   is the validation and regulatory acceptance of new test methods that
   are more predictive of human and ecological effects than currently
   available methods. Additional Information Additional information can be
   found at the ICCVAM/Center Website: http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov and in

   Test Methods, a Report of the ad hoc Interagency Coordinating Committee

   Estimate In Vivo Starting Doses for Acute Toxicity Numerous
   demonstrations of strong correlations between cytotoxicity in vitro and
   animal lethality in vivo exist. (For reviews see Phillips et al., 1990,
   and Garle et al., 1994). Recently, several major international in vitro
   initiatives have been directed toward reducing the use of laboratory
   animals for acute toxicity testing (Curren et al., 1998; Ekwall et al.,
   2000; Ohno et al., 1998a, 1998b, 1998c; Seibert et al., 1996; Spielmann
   et al., 1999). The status of these initiatives was reviewed at the
   International Workshop on In Vitro Methods for Assessing Acute Systemic
   Toxicity, jointly sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental
   Health Sciences (NIEHS), the National Toxicology Program (NTP), and the
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). Conclusions and
   recommendations from the workshop are published in the Report of the
   International Workshop on In Vitro Methods for Assessing Acute Systemic
   Toxicity (NIEHS, 2001). The RC has made a major contribution to the
   knowledge of the correlation between in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo
   lethality (Halle and Spielmann, 1992; Halle, 1998). The most recent RC
   compilation (Halle, 1998) contains in vitro cytotoxicity information
   (1,912 single IC50 values averaged for each of 347 chemicals [i.e., one
   IC50x value/chemical from multiple reports in the literature]) paired
   with 347 in vivo acute oral LD50 values (mmol/kg) for rats (282 values)
   or mice (65 values) from the National Institute for Occupational Safety
   and Health (NIOSH) Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances
   (RTECS). (See Appendix A for the RC data.) Criteria for data to be
   included in the RC database are fully described by Halle (1998) and
   briefly described by Spielmann et al. (1999). The combination of rat
   and mouse data was justified, since it yielded a regression that was
   not significantly different from those obtained with either rat data or
   mouse data alone. The RC data clearly demonstrate a strong relationship
   between in vitro cytotoxicity and acute lethality in rodents (Figure
   1). 2 Using In Vitro Data to Estimate In Vivo Starting Doses for Acute

   since, on average, the number of consecutive dosing steps is minimal if
   the starting dose is close to the true toxicity class (ATC) or to the
   true LD50 (UDP). 1.4 Determination of In Vitro Test Performance
   Characteristics Before the results obtained with any in vitro
   cytotoxicity test are used with the RC regression to generate an
   expected LD50 value, the performance characteristics of the new method
   should be determined and compared with those of the RC information as
   discussed in Section 3.1. Section 3.2 suggests a set of reference
   chemicals that should be tested with the candidate in vitro
   cytotoxicity method. The resultant regression line should then be
   compared with that of the current RC regression line. If the line falls
   within the + log 5 boundaries indicated in Figure 1, then the
   regression parameters of the RC may be used to predict the LD50
   starting dose. Section 3.3 describes experimental trials, using two
   different cell types, performed after the workshop with the set of
   recommended reference chemicals. These experimental trials are included
   as examples of how to determine test performance for any in vitro test
   for basal cytotoxicity and to confirm the applicability of the test for
   use with the RC regression. 4 Using In Vitro Data to Estimate In Vivo

   To determine whether predicted LD50 values from a basal cytotoxicity

   of basal doses for routine testing of acute oral toxicity with
   cytotoxicity were sufficiently predictive for the the ATC or the UDP
   methods, Spielmann et al. rodent LD50 such that cytotoxicity tests
   could be (1999) suggested a procedure which is shown in used to predict

   be the BALB/c 3T3 cytotoxicity could be used to determine the best NRU

   addition, if the LD50 Spielmann et al., 1991, 1993, 1996; Balls et al.,
   predicted from cytotoxicity is high (i.e., 2,000 1995; Brantom et al.,
   1997). An alternative test, mg/kg b.w.), a range-finding study for the

   NHK NRU initiated using the limit test of 2,000 or 5,000 assay
   (Willshaw et al., 1994; Sina et al., 1995; mg/kg. Gettings et al.,
   1996; Harbell et al., 1997). Before using a candidate in vitro
   cytotoxicity test To allow comparison of the regression obtained to
   predict starting doses, the correlation between with the candidate test
   (Figure 2, Step 2), selected the in vitro test and the in vivo test
   must be reference chemicals should cover the entire range established
   quantitatively. This can be achieved of cytotoxicity and be as close as
   possible to the either by (1) in vitro testing of a large number of RC

   LD50 values and deriving a with 11 reference chemicals from the RC and
   their regression formula based on the correlation corresponding LD50
   values.) The regression between in vivo and in vitro data, or by (2)
   testing equation from the candidate test is calculated by a smaller
   number of chemicals and applying linear regression (least square
   method) using the Halle's RC prediction model (i.e., regression
   candidate IC50 values and the corresponding LD50 formula), which is
   derived from the correlation of values from the RC (given in Table 1 in
   Section in vivo and in vitro data for 347 chemicals (Halle, 3.2). The
   resulting regression is then compared 1998; Spielmann et al., 1999). In
   the latter case, with the RC regression (Figure 2, Step 3). in vitro

   interval, then the test is considered suitable to generate IC50 data to

   criteria of a test for basal using two candidate NRU test protocols
   (see cytotoxicity defined by Spielmann et al. (1999). SOPs in
   Appendices C and D). The cells used in this exercise were NHK obtained
   commercially from Clonetics Corp (Walkersville, MD, USA) and mouse
   BALB/c 3T3 clone A31 cells. Each of the 11 reference chemicals was
   tested in three independent test trials with each of the two cell
   types. The outcomes of the experiments are shown in Figure 3 for the
   NHK and in Figure 4 for the BALB/c 3T3. Both figures depict the RC
   regression ± log 5 interval (black lines) and the 11 reference
   chemicals (triangles). Other chemicals from the RC were omitted for
   clarity. The new IC50 values (means of the three trials) obtained with
   the NHK NRU test (Figure 3), or 3T3 NRU test (Figure 4) are shown
   (squares), as well as the new linear regression lines determined from
   these data (gray dashed line). The new regression lines obtained with
   NHK and 3T3 cells are within the ± log 5 interval of the RC, and,
   though slightly steeper, are almost parallel to the RC regression
   function. Thus, intercepts and regression coefficients of the
   experimentally obtained new regressions do not differ significantly

   Toiletry and Perfumery Association (COLIPA) eye irritation study
   (Brantom et al., 1997). The 3T3 NRU Phototoxicity Test is a
   modification of the BALB/c 3T3 NRU test and involves a shorter chemical
   exposure and the additional application of light. The 3T3 NRU
   Phototoxicity Test has been fully validated (Spielmann et al., 1998a,b)
   and has gained regulatory acceptance. For the purpose of evaluating the
   NRU test, and specifically the BALB/c 3T3 NRU test, as a standard test
   for basal cytotoxicity, all results available from these studies
   regarding the reliability (reproducibility within and between
   laboratories and over time) should be used to avoid wasting resources
   in repeating the establishment of reliability. Section 4.2 contains an
   example of establishing reliability of the BALB/c 3T3 NRU test from one
   of these studies. 4.2 Reliability of the 3T3 NRU Test To establish
   interlaboratory reproducibility in the first phase of the German eye
   irritation validation study (Spielmann et al., 1991), 32 chemicals were
   tested in 12 laboratories using two tests: the hen's egg
   test-chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) and the BALB/c 3T3 NRU test.

   expected to fall, with a probability of 95%. 16 Using In Vitro Data to
   Estimate In Vivo Starting Doses for Acute Toxicity The second phase of
   the German eye irritation validation study was a blind trial for
   database development and involved the testing of 150 chemicals
   (Spielmann et al., 1993, 1996). Each chemical was assigned at random to
   two of the 12 total laboratories, since reproducibility of the BALB/c
   3T3 NRU test was not an issue at this stage of the study. The final
   publication (Spielmann et al., 1997) on this phase focused on
   predictivity and test strategies for identification of severe eye
   irritants. The data from this publication have been re-analyzed for the
   present guidance document in the following way: since each chemical was
   tested in two different laboratories, the IC50 values obtained in two
   laboratories were plotted against each other, as shown in Figure 5 for
   147 of the 150 chemicals. (Three chemicals had to be excluded because
   they were not tested according to the SOP.) Note that "Lab 1"
   represents the total of all participating laboratories, as does "Lab
   2". Thus, Figure 5 does not show the comparability of results between
   two given laboratories. Rather, it shows the comparability of data
   obtained under routine conditions between randomly selected
   laboratories performing the BALB/c 3T3 NRU test according to the same
   SOP. Results of the correlation analysis shown in Figure 5 are quite
   promising, since the linear correlation line (black) deviates only
   slightly from the ideal line (gray line at 45° angle). The linear
   correlation coefficient of r = 0.88 (R2 = 0.775) shows a sufficient
   comparability of the data. Outliers, where data of the two laboratories
   differed by more than 1 log, occurred for less than 10% of the
   chemicals. A predominant reason for these interlaboratory deviations,
   discussed in Spielmann et al. (1997), was that one laboratory had used
   an adequate solvent for a test chemical, while the other laboratory had
   tested the chemical in media at concentra
