     training programs that are designed to promote safety and health in the
     Nation's mining industry. The Directorate has three major components
     for operations: the Policy and Program Coordination Division, the
     National Mine Health and Safety Academy in Beckley, West Virginia, and
     Educacational Field Services. The Directorate plans, monitors, and
     evaluates all MSHA education and training programs addressing mine
     safety and health, and provides training at the Academy. The
     Directorate administers the State Grants Program, which provides
     funding to state mining agencies to supplement their mining health and
     safety programs. EPD also sponsors the Joseph A. Holmes Safety
     Association and the Holmes Safety Association.
