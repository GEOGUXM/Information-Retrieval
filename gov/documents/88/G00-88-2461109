                Consultation services that can save you money

   L&I consultants provide a variety of no-fee services to help employers
   and workers.

Safety and health consultations

   L&I has consultation and education services that assist employers at
   their job site. This team of safety consultants and industrial
   hygienists is available upon request to assist employers in developing
   and maintaining a safe and healthful workplace. Services include:
     * Visits by employer invitation
     * Confidentiality
     * No citations or penalties
     * Letter explaining the finding
     * Follow-ups on all serious hazards

Loss control

   Managing your risk of on-the-job accidents and illnesses can hold down
   employer costs and build employee morale. Staff help employers analyze
   their risk factors and obtain appropriate consultative services to
   minimize these risks. The program also helps employers control costs of
   industrial insurance claims by providing claims management training and
   financial analysis for retrospective rating programs.

Return to work

   Vocational consultants in this program help employers establish
   policies and procedures for return-to-work programs and develop
   return-to-work options for injured workers, as well as job analysis and
   job modification assistance.

Occupational therapy

   Therapists provide on-site evaluations to enable injured workers to
   remain on the job through job modification of equipment, tools or
   tasks. They analyze job tasks and the physical requirements of jobs,
   including ergonomics, to develop strategies to reduce risk of injury.

Retrospective rating

   One option available to assist employers in reducing their industrial
   insurance costs is a financial incentive program called Retrospective
   Rating (Retro). The Retro program gives employers an incentive to
   increase safety awareness, reduce accidents and become more involved in
   the minimization of claims costs once they occur.

Apprenticeship

   Apprenticeship is the best way to learn a trade. Unlike most college
   programs, apprentices work for wages while they learn their trade. At
   first, they earn less money than skilled workers, but as they progress
   their salary increases until they attain mastery of the craft and
   skilled worker wages. In Washington, apprenticeship can prepare people
   for work in more than 750 occupations. The apprenticeship coordinator
   can assist employees and individuals with questions about
   apprenticeship.

No-fee educational workshops

   L&I offers over 1,000 no-fee educational workshops each year across the
   state to educate employers and their workers regarding rights,
   requirements and obligations under workers compensation and industrial
   safety and health laws. They include tips and suggestions for cutting
   industrial insurance premiums and maintaining safe and healthy
   workplaces.

   For more information or a catalog with descriptions and a schedule,
   contact the workshop coordinator in Tumwater (360-902-5590).


                       Insurance services you may need

Claims management

   The claim manager is responsible for the initial allowance or rejection
   of employer, attending doctor and other team members to return the
   worker to the job and resolve the claim.

Fraud investigation

   If there is a reason to suspect a workers compensation claim may be
   fraudulent, the investigations staff will work with the claim manager
   to obtain necessary information to determine the claims validity and
   resolve the issues.

Field audit

   The audit section has the responsibility for ensuring that employers
   accurately report employee work activities upon which their Industrial
   Insurance premiums are based. Staff strive to educate the employer
   community regarding the determination of employee status, exemptions,
   record keeping rules and numerous risk classification reporting rules.

Revenue collection

   When taxes to the department become past due, the collection of those
   taxes is assigned to a regional revenue officer who works with the
   debtor to resolve the problem. Debt resolution ranges from determining
   that the department was in error in assessing the debt to seizure and
   sales of the debtors assets.

             Compliance activities . . . ensuring public safety

   Labor and Industries is required to perform inspections and conduct
   investigations to ensure worker and public safety, and that employers
   are in compliance with state industrial insurance regulations. Heres a
   look at what these activities include:

Safety and health compliance (WISHA)

   This group is charged with ensuring that each employer in the state
   provides a place of employment free of recognizable safety and health
   hazards. Employees have the right to file complaints with L&I, should
   employers fail to ensure a safe place to work. The compliance staff
   also investigates workplace accidents, employee complaints about
   workplace safety and health practices and conducts scheduled
   inspections at work sites.

Electrical services

   This section performs electrical inspections of residential, commercial
   and industrial (new and remodeled) occupancies. The section also
   licenses electricians. Additionally, the section ensures electrical
   licensing compliance and issues citations to non-compliant individuals
   and companies for any infractions.

Elevators and boiler/pressure vessels

   Inspectors conduct annual inspections of these devices and also
   investigate accidents. They are available for consultation and to
   respond to questions.

Factory-assembled mobile homes/structures inspections

   Inspectors are responsible for inspecting new and altered manufactured
   homes, and manufacturers.

Contractor registration

   Inspectors ensure that local construction contractors are properly
   registered with the state.

Employment standards

   This program is responsible for enforcing state wage and hour laws
   governing such areas as minimum wage, agreed wage, overtime, prevailing
   wages on public works projects and record keeping requirements. This
   program is also responsible for child labor laws, the issuance of minor
   work permits, employment standards, family leave and care, and
   contractor registration of farm labor.
