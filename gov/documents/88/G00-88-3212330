       Welcome.  STAC and Special Aids is the unit within the NYS
   Education Department responsible for processing requests for
   Commissioner's approval for reimbursement. This includes reimbursement
   approval for the costs of providing services to preschool and
   school-age students placed in special education programs at public and
   SED-approved private schools, special act school districts, BOCES, and
   at state-supported and state-operated schools for the deaf and blind.
   It also includes reimbursement approval for students who have been
   determined to be homeless, runaway youth and for education services
   provided to incarcerated youth. This year STAC will process over
   180,000 requests for reimbursement.
