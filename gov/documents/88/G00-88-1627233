                              Current Projects

     The Science Information System (SIS) provides access to information
     on BRD science projects. The SIS is designed to meet the information
     needs of scientists and resource managers -- both within the BRD and
     in partner organizations, client agencies, and interest groups.

     The SIS provides information at the project level for BRD programs.
     A project is the smallest segment into which BRD science is divided;
     it is the level at which hypotheses are tested or specific questions
     are addressed. A project has a specific objective, which does not
     change over the life of the project, and a finite duration (i.e.,
     well-defined start and end dates), and results in a specific end
     product or products.

     To provide initial entries for the SIS Input Questionnaire, go to:
     http://sis.cr.usgs.gov/sis (for BRD use only).

     For SIS Reviewers to review information entered at the SIS Input
     Questionnaire, go to:
     http://sis.cr.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/sis_reviewer.cgi (for BRD use only).

     For SIS Updaters to update information that has already been
     reviewed, go to:
     http://sis.cr.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/sis_update.cgi (for BRD use only).

                 Current Research Information System (CRIS)

     Current Research Information System (CRIS)

     CRIS is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) computer-based
     documentation and reporting system for ongoing agricultural, food
     and nutrition, biological, and forestry research. CRIS is designed
     to provide ready access to information about research conducted
     primarily within the USDA/state agricultural research system.
     However, CRIS also contains research information on projects
     conducted by the USGS Biological Resources Discipline (BRD). You can
     use CRIS to plan research, avoid costly duplication, determine
     current areas of emphasis, or establish valuable contacts.

     Record Content

     The basic unit of project documentation in CRIS is the Research Work
     Unit. Typically, this is a three- to five-year research activity at
     a single location. The research generally focuses on a clearly
     definable problem, a manageable phase of a larger problem, or a few
     closely related elements of a broad-based research program. Each
     project includes information on:
   WHAT is being done.
       WHO is doing it.
       WHERE it is being conducted.
       WHEN it is performed.
       PROGRESS achieved.
       PUBLICATIONS produced.

     Subfiles. The CRIS technical database contains several subfiles on
     agricultural, biological, and related research conducted by other
     Federal agencies and foreign institutions. For example:

     The BRD Science Information System (SIS) provides access to ongoing
     biological scientific research at the project level. More than 2,000
     entries describe BRD research efforts.

     The Human Nutrition Research and Information Management System
     (HNRIMS) subfile contains narrative summaries on approximately 4,000
     projects that describe human nutrition research conducted or
     sponsored by participating Federal agencies. The subfile is prepared
     jointly by the USDA and the National Institutes of Health, U.S.
     Department of Health and Human Services.

     The Inventory of Canadian Agri-Food Research (ICAR) subfile is a
     comprehensive, up-to-date database for agricultural and food
     research in Canada. ICAR describes over 4,000 projects from
     industry, universities, and provincial and federal establishments
     and is produced by the Canadian Agri-Food Research Council.

     The Czech Agricultural Research Information System (CZARIS) subfile
     describes some 200 current Czech agricultural, forestry, and food
     and nutrition research projects and is produced by the Institute of
     Agricultural and Food Information, Ministry of Agriculture of the
     Czech Republic.
