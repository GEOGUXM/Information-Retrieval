   Our extrasolar planet search differs from others in the use of a new
   kind of instrument for measuring stellar Doppler velocities, which we
   call a fringing spectrometer or spectrally dispersed interferometer.

   The simple instrument response of the interferometer allows <1 m/s
   velocity resolution. Spectrally dispersing the fringes increases their
   fringe visibility and boosts signal to noise over traditional white
   light interferometers. The whole instrument can be optimized for high
   efficiency because the disperser is not used to resolve Doppler shifts
   and therefore the grating technology can be chosen to maximize
   throughput rather than to achieve tight point spread function. Other
   benefits are an etendue (field of view) which is two orders of
   magnitude greater than current high radial velocity spectrometers, low
   cost and compact size (TV-sized instead of kitchen-sized).

   This is a pilot project funded by the Laboratory Directed Research and
   Developement program (98-ERD-054). It is an excellant example of cross
   disciplinary research as we are melding velocimetry and white light
   interferometry technology developed at H-division's two stage gas gun
   (David Ersine) together with astronomical spectroscopy (Jian Ge and
   Gibor Basri).

   We have nearly finished benchtop testing on a prototype instrument, and
   are now engaged in adapting the instrument for use at an observatory on
   starlight. We anticipate that our cleaner instrument response will
   allow us to detect smaller mass planets and resolve photosphere
   dynamics (asteroseismology). An anticipated variation of the instrument
   which uses two interferometer cavity lengths in parallel can measure
   lineshape changes simultaneous to Doppler shifts. This is another
   avenue of probing the stellar photosphere dynamics.

   Our immediate goal is to demonstrate on starlight the anticipated
   advantages of the instrument. Secondly, to begin an observational
   program to detect Saturn-like or smaller extrasolar planets (<3 m/s),
   or detect planetary companions to known extrasolar planets. Thirdly, to
   measure ringing of a stellar photosphere, analogous to the solar
   "5-minute" oscillations.
