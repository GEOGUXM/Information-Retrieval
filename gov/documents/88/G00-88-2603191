   Submillimeter And Far Infrared Experiment

   Background

      SAFIRE (Submillimeter And Far Infrared Experiment for SOFIA) is an
      Imaging Fabry-Perot Bolometer array spectrometer covering 145-655
      microns to be flown as a Principal Investigator-class Science
      instrument (PSI) on the NASA airborne infrared observatory, SOFIA.
      SAFIRE is a SOFIA First Light Instrument.

      From the SAFIRE proposal abstract:

        "The Submillimeter is the last major window in the electromagnetic
        spectrum to be opened. In spite of a wealth of lines of atoms and
        molecules which are diagnostic of all the major components of the
        interstellar medium and star forming regions, the scientific
        exploitation of this spectral region has progressed slowly, because
        the required technologies for high performance instruments were not
        available. ... SAFIRE is a versatile imaging Fabry-Perot
        spectrograph covering the spectral region from 145 to 655 microns
        with spectral resolving powers ranging from 5 to 10^4. ...

        SAFIRE can determine the energy balance and physical conditions in
        many important phases of the interstellar and circumstellar
        environment by imaging these regions in lines arising from
        molecular, atomic and ionized components, along with the dust
        emission. These observations are critical to achieving a clear
        understanding of the process which result in the formation of stars,
        and which control star formation on a galactic scale in starburst
        galaxies. SAFIRE can also examine active galactic nuclei, cooling
        flows in galaxy clusters, circumstellar debris disks, and the
        chemistry of the outer planets...."

   What Makes SAFIRE Unique

      During the initial phase, SAFIRE will have a High Resolution
      Fabry-Perot Interferometer, with a resolving power of 1000-10,0000,
      imaged on a 32x32 Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometer array. The 1
      millimeter square pixels correspond to 10.6 arc seconds in size,
      smaller than the resolution limit of the SOFIA telescope over the
      entire instrument spectral band. The TES array will use a SQUID based
      cryogenic multiplexing amplifier, allowing observations of very low
      flux sources, limited only by the sky and telescope background.

      Additional funding will allow an augmentation of the SAFIRE
      capabilities with the addition of a second 32x32 array, behind a lower
      resolution Fabry-Perot (resolving power of 100). A slit and grating
      would also be useable in this beam to give non-imaging spectroscopy.

      Although a Principal Investigator-class Science instrument (PSI),
      rather than a Facility-class Science Instrument (FSI), SAFIRE is
      intended to be well integrated with the SOFIA observatory
      infrastructure, including observation planning, commanding, and basic
      data analysis. We are actively soliciting prospective collaborators to
      generate observation programs to maximize the return from the leap in
      capabilities offered by SAFIRE. Interested colleagues are urged to
      register for the SAFIRE announcement list.
