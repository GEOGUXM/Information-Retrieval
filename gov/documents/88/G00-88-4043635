   The Assistant Director of Legislation and Policy Development advises
   the Director, the California Health and Human Services Agency and the
   Administration on issues that impact the elderly and adults with
   functional impairments. Legislation can have a positive or adverse
   affect on the Department's programs or operations. Promotion and
   advocacy on behalf of the Administration's programs by providing
   information to legislators and their staff is of critical importance.
