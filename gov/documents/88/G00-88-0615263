       Description:
           Abstract:
               An automated inventory of the names and locations of physical
               and cultural geographic features located throughout the United St
ates
           Purpose:
               To promote geographic feature name standardization and to serve
               as the Federal Government's repository of information regarding f
eature name spellings
               and applications for features in U.S. The names listed in the inv
entory can be published
               on Federal maps, charts, and in other documents.  The feature loc
ative information has
               been used in emergency preparedness, marketing, site-selection an
d analysis, genealogical
               and historical research, and transportation routing applications.

       Data_Set_Credit:
           The Geographic Names Information System was developed
           by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the U.S. Board on G
eographic
           Names.
       Native_Data_Set_Environment:
           The Geographic Names Information System is resident on a Sun Enterpri
se 4000 computer.
           It uses Sun Solaris Version 2.6 as its operating system.  The system
contains approximately
           1.5 million records, averaging 500 bytes in length.

Data_Quality_Information:

       Attribute_Accuracy:
           Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
               A random sample of 10% of the entries in the system were visually
               verified against the compilation source data (large-scale USGS
               topographic maps) to ensure an accuracy rate of at least 95%.
       Logical_Consistency_Report:
           Locative references (geographic coordinates, topographic map, and cou
nty)
           are cross-checked for logical consistency.
       Completeness_Report:
           This dataset contains information about physical and cultural geograp
hic
           features identified by a proper name, with the exception of most road
s
           and highways.
       Positional_Accuracy:
           Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
               Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
                  Accuracy of these digital data is based upon the use of source
                  graphics which are compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Stan
dards.
                  Comparision to the graphic source is used as control to assess
                  digital positional accuracy.

               The dataset contains records for named geographic features locate
d in the
               United States, its Territories and Outlying Areas.  The records a
re organized
               by State (or State equivalent).  Each record includes: the offici
al name of
               the feature; the feature type; the county(s) in which the feature
 is located;
               the name(s) of the USGS 1:24,000-scale topographic map(s) on whic
h the feature
               is shown; geographic coordinates locating the mouth of linear fea
tures and the
               approximate center of areal features, and coordinates locating th
e feature on
               each additional (if any) USGS 1:24,000-scale map on which the fea
ture is shown;
               a bibliographic code referring to the source of information for e
ach record,
               and other names by which the feature may be or may have been know
n.  Some
               records include information about the history of the feature or t
he origin
               of the feature name.
