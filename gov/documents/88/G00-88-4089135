                             Access Information

   Welcome to the Metropolitan Transportation Commission's main World Wide
   Web site. We are pleased to provide an electronic medium for accessing
   information about our programs and services. If you have any
   suggestions for improving accessibility features of our Web site,
   please contact our Web master, Brenda Kahn, at the following e-mail
   address: bkahn@mtc.ca.gov

   Information for users who are visually impaired:
   Our Web site is being improved to be used with screen readers. Because
   we have a navigation bar at the lefthand side of most pages, and
   because a few pages feature multiple columns, you may need to reformat
   pages into a single column. Most images on our Web site are accompanied
   by alternate text image tags that should be readable if your browser
   supports the alt-text function. Each major item on the navigation bar
   is also listed on a site index that can be found at
   http://www.mtc.ca.gov/sitemap.htm. We will link to the site index from
   the home page as well as from most other pages.

   If a Web page has an on-line form or document that is not accessible,
   please contact the MTC Public Information Office to request an
   alternate format. MTC's Public Information Office can be reached at
   Tel. (510) 464-7787, or by e-mail at info@mtc.ca.gov.

   Instructions for users who are hearing impaired:
   At this time, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission has not posted
   audio or video clips on our Web site.
