   Research Interests:

   Research has centered on conformations and interactions of DNA,
   molecular genetics and biochemistry of bacteriophage T7, and, more
   recently, piloting of technology for high-throughput determination of
   protein structures.

   T7 has been a continuing interest since the 1960s. T7 genes were
   defined and mapped genetically, and functions of many of them have been
   determined by a variety of biochemical and physical techniques.
   Processes studied include entry of T7 DNA into its host cell, E. coli;
   overcoming host restriction; expression of T7 genes and shut-off of
   host functions; replication, processing and packaging of T7 DNA; and
   structure and assembly of phage particles. Determination of the
   complete nucleotide sequence of T7 DNA, 39,937 base pairs, revealed
   coding sequences for more than fifty T7 proteins and the arrangement of
   signals that direct gene expression. All of the T7 proteins can now be
   expressed from clones, independently or during infection, and virus
   mutants defective in any T7 gene have been isolated and characterized.

   The challenges and outcomes of this basic research have spurred the
   development of some widely used research methods, including
   sedimentation to measure lengths of single- and double-stranded DNA,
   and slab gels for electrophoresis of proteins and nucleic acids. An
   understanding of how T7 so efficiently directs an infected cell to
   produce T7 gene products led to the cloning of T7 RNA polymerase, which
   is used to produce almost any RNA, and to development of the versatile
   T7 expression system, which uses T7 RNA polymerase and T7 signals to
   produce almost any protein from its cloned coding sequence.

   Current work is directed toward structural genomics, the systematic
   determination of 3-dimensional structures of proteins representative of
   the range of protein structure and function found in nature. Procedures
   are being developed for high-throughput x-ray crystallography of
   proteins expressed from cloned genomic or cDNA. Initial targets include
   a variety of yeast proteins and a set of human proteins implicated in
   sensing and repairing DNA damage. Progress toward obtaining structures
   of targeted proteins may be viewed at
   www.proteome.bnl.gov/progress.html. The aim, ultimately, is to build a
   body of structural information that will facilitate prediction of a
   reasonable structure and potential function for almost any protein from
   knowledge of its coding sequence.
