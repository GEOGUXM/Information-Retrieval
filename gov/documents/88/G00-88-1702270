   Welcome to Independent Congressman
   Bernie Sanders' Web Page
   Press Release, 1/29/2002
       Enron = Why We Need Campaign Finance Reform
       In an editorial featured on the progressive web site Common Dreams
       today, Rep. Sanders cited the Enron scandal as exhibit #1 in the
       case favoring the need for immediate campaign reform. The
       now-defunct energy giant dolled out some $6 million in campaign
       contributions at the same time that its business was failing.
       Sanders called Enron “a poster child of how a group of powerful
       corporate leaders come to exert enormous clout over elected
       officials and get the rules changed in their favor.” (FULL STORY)
