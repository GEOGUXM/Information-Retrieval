   Information Science & Technology logo Goddard Space Flight Center's
   Assistant Director for Information Sciences and Chief Information
   Officer is proud to host Goddard's Information Science and Technology
   (IS&T) Colloquium Series for Spring of 2002. The series was established
   in 2000 to promote awareness of Goddard's focus on information sciences
   and technologies, and joins the Center's already established
   Engineering and Scientific Colloquia programs.
   We have assembled an inspiring and distinctive slate of speakers who
   are leaders in the cutting edge world of Information Science and
   Technology. Please join us!
   Webcasts of past IS&T Colloquia may be viewed from the Webcasts Archive
   page.
   If you wish to attend the Colloquium and do not have a permanent NASA
   ID badge with your picture, please contact Darleen Mayo (301) 286-5710,
   48 hours in advance.
   Goddard's IS&T Colloquia are typically held on alternate Wednesdays,
   from 3:30-4:30 PM. Because of construction in the Building 3
   Auditorium, colloquia dates and location are subject to change. Please
   visit our website for auditorium location, speaker information and
   abstracts, as well as webcasts and schedule updates.
