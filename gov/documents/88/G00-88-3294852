   TO: CALIFORNIA VETERANS

   SUBJECT: HEPATITIS C ALERT AND TESTING

   Hepatitis C (HCV) is a blood-borne virus that requires an exchange of
   hepatitis C contaminated blood. Hepatitis C is an inflammation of the
   liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. It is often a silent disease
   that can hide in the body for up to 30 years without symptoms. The
   infected person may not feel anything is wrong, even while the disease
   is causing permanent liver damage.

   A FEW STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT VIETNAM VETERANS MAY BE AT A GREATER RISK
   FOR HEPATITIS C DEPENDING ON THEIR EXPERIENCE IN SERVICE AND OTHER
   EXPOSURES BEFORE AND AFTER SERVICE.
    1. In your military service, have you ever been in a situation in
       which you have had exposure to someone else's blood through contact
       with a bleeding wound, though needlestick injury, or in any other
       way?
    2. Did you serve in Vietnam?
    3. Did you have a blood transfusion or organ transplant before 1992?
    4. Have you ever, EVEN ONCE, injected drugs?
    5. Have you ever, EVEN ONCE, snorted or inhale cocaine using a straw
       or bill?
    6. Have you ever had unprotected sex with multiple partners?
    7. Have you ever had hemodialysis?
    8. Were you born to an HCV-infected mother?
    9. Have you received, before 1987, blood products for clotting
       problems?
   10. Have you ever had an abnormal liver function test?

   ALL "AT RISK" VETERANS AS WELL AS ANY CONCERNED VETERANS SHOULD CONTACT
   THEIR NEAREST VA TREATMENT FACILITY FOR TESTING. You can locate your
   nearest VA Medical facility on the web at the VA Facilities Directory
   or by calling the VA at 1-800-827-1000.

   Please share this information with your members fellow veterans and
   veterans organizations.
