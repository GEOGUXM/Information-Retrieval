   NOAA Employees in the Washington Metropolitan Area

                                                                     From:
   Zane E. Schauer, Director for Human Resources Management

                                                                  Subject:
   Emergency Closure and Dismissal Procedures

        It's that time of year when severe weather conditions can affect
        office openings and dismissals. For the procedures for official
        notification of agency closings/dismissals due to emergency
        conditions, such as adverse weather, disruption of power and/or
        water, interruption of public transportation, and other emergency
        situations, please see:
        http://www.rdc.noaa.gov/~hrmo/emergency-closure.htm

        Closure procedures apply to non-emergency employees (including
        employees telecommuting at an alternative worksite), in the
        Washington, D.C. metropolitan area only (not outside the Capital
        Beltway). Emergency employees whose services are required during
        emergencies are expected to report to work.
