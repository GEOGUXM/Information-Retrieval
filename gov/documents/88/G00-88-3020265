Residential Department

   Residential Services provides a homelike environment that encourages
   students to attain proficiency and independence in all aspects of daily
   living, to the extent of each childs individual potential.

   Students are evaluated as to their skills and performance in techniques
   of daily living. Residential staff, in conjunction with parents and
   education staff, determine skill areas in which students will receive
   instruction. Students are taught strategies that enable them to develop
   social skills, emotional stability and to care for their personal needs
   more independently.

   Social competencies are reinforced through planned recreational
   activities. Recreation programs teach students to develop lifelong
   leisure skills and interests through a wide variety of activities made
   available on campus and in the community of Vancouver.

For more information on the Residential Department please contact
Renee Corso at (360) 696-6321 x121.
