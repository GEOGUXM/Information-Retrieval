    The Alternative Fuels Data Center contains refueling stations for the
   following alternative fuels: Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), 85% Ethanol
   (E85), Liquefied Petroleum Gas/propane (LPG), BioDiesel, Electric, and
   Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). These stations are located throughout the
   United States, and information is gathered from trade associations,
   industry contacts, retailers, and general literature.
     * Alternative Fuel Station Locator
       This application provides maps and refueling station details of
       Alternative Fuel (CNG, E85, LPG, BioDiesel, LNG, Electric)
       stations. Station Details include address, phone number, hours of
       operation, payment types (if available), and fuel-specific
       information.
