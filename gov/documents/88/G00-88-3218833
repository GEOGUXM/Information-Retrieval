   Arroyo Cycle and Climate
   The arroyo cycle and climate change are of scientific and practical
   interest. The Rio Puerco Basin, New Mexico, is an area of historic
   arroyo incision, long-term geomorphic investigation, and ongoing land
   management issues. This website comprises earth science and historical
   perspectives of the Rio Puerco Basin, and data and models that can be
   used to help predict responses to future changes of climate and
   landuse.

   Historic Photos and Repeat Photography
   Impacts of the late 19th century arroyo incision, and subsequent
   sediment aggradation, can be documented through repeat photography.
   Historic photos from selected locations in the basin were obtained from
   the USGS photo archive in Denver, CO. Repeat photography was done by
   Scott Aby in 1998. We welcome any contributions to this historic
   archive.

   Erosion Rates and Sediment Monitoring
   One cannot talk about the Rio Puerco without talking about sediment.
   The USGS in conjunction with other federal and state agencies and
   Universities has established methods and sites for monitoring sediment
   yields in the Puerco. Allen Gellis has summarized the history of gaging
   and sediment collection and is developing a sediment budget for the Rio
   Puerco. Gaging of the main stem and tributaries, such as Arroyo Chavez,
   allows for comparison of sediment yields over various spatial and
   temporal scales.

   Cosmogenic isotopes ^10Be and ^26Al provide evidence for upland erosion
   rates and residence time of sediment in temporary storage on hillslopes
   and low-order stream alluvium. Sampling and analysis are being
   conducted by Paul Bierman at the University of Vermont.

   Past Climate and Cycles of Change
   The late Quaternary record dated by ^14C provides evidence for climate
   change over the past 30,000 years. Within that time, intervals as short
   as a few hundred years, such as the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice
   Age, can be distinguished.

   Tree ring records provide a 2000 year record of rainfall cycles for the
   western part of the basin. Records from the El Malpais National
   Monument have been studied recently by Henri Grissino-Mayer.

   Archeological Sites
   Over ten thousand archeological sites are known to exist in the Rio
   Puerco Basin, ranging in age from paleoindian (9,500 to 9,000 BC) to
   19^th and 20^th century historic settlements. These sites can aid in
   the understanding of population dynamics, settlement pattern analyses,
   and provide clues to landscape and environmental changes.

   Online Data Library
   Data sets for the project are being prepared for online distribution at
   the Rocky Mountain Mapping Center. Browse the Online Data Library for
   GIS coverages and aerial photos that are available for downloading and
   viewing.

   Modeling Channel Processes
   Hydrologic and geomorphic data are being used to calibrate a model of
   water and sediment discharge in the arroyo. A model overview shows the
   links from the atmosphere to hillslopes and channel processes.
   Preliminary hillslope flow model results for Arroyo Chavez are
   presented in the detailed diagrams. Data from six stream gages will be
   used to test model outputs of stream discharge. Channelization has
   produced dramatic effects near La Ventana in the Upper Puerco. Please

   information, or visit the Water Resources Division's Albuquerque
   District Office to learn more about hydrology and sediment in New
   Mexico.
