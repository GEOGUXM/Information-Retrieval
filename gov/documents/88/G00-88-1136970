                 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Services

   Welcome to the EEO Services page. This page is intended to provide an
   overview of EEO services offered to Federal customers. As seen from the
   services offered, we are a full service EEO operation with extensive
   experience and quality service. If you require further information
   e:mail us at the address at the bottom of this page.

   Our EEO staff is well versed in the statutes, Code of Federal
   Regulations, Management Directives, and Executive Orders that govern
   the Equal Employment Opportunity process. In addition, our staff
   receives annual refresher training to ensure an understanding of recent
   changes that could impact our work.

   Public Debt provides you latitude in selecting only the parts of your
   EEO program that present challenges to you. Or, at your discretion,
   Public Debt can assume responsibility for your entire EEO program. Our
   services include EEO pre-complaint counseling, alternative dispute
   resolution mediation, formal investigations, EEO Officer services in
   connection with complaints within the framework of your agency, annual
   report preparation for the services you select, and cultural awareness
   education services.

   Program Assumption

   If you elect to have Public Debt assume responsibility for your entire
   EEO program BPD will provide an "all employees" memo (hard copy)
   announcing the EEO function being moved. BPD will provide posters,
   including pictures, phone numbers, and pertinent time frames in
   quantities sufficient to meet posting requirements contained in
   regulation at all of your locations.

   BPD will draft reaffirmations of all your agency's pertinent EEO
   policies, we will re-produce them and distribute them to your
   employees, as well as having them posted at designated locations
   throughout your site.

   Informal Stage

   Public Debt can provide informal counseling to your employees with our
   cadre of experienced counselors and staff.

   Counseling is provided in accordance with the EEOC regulations set
   forth in 29 CFR, Part 1614.105, the EEOC Management Directive 110 and
   the EEOC's "A Guide to Effective Counseling." Counseling efforts will
   include documentation sufficient to assure the rights of the
   Complainant and meet the regulatory requirements of the agency.

   Formal Stage

   Formal complaints will be handled in accordance with your agency
   procedures and directives and proposals will be prepared specific to
   each agency.

   At the formal complaint stage, Public Debt will obtain investigations
   of complaints that are filed formally. Public Debt's EEO Officer will
   act in the capacity of EEO Officer for your agency on a billable hour
   basis. Acting in this capacity may include interacting with the
   Regional Complaints Center, where appropriate, reviewing and following
   up on Open Case Reports, assisting in scheduling formal investigations
   and alternative dispute sessions, assisting in obtaining evidence and
   witness statements, reviewing and making appropriate suggestions for
   supplementin Investigative Files, and assisting in resolution attempts
   and settlement discussions.

   Special Emphasis Programming

   Public Debt can provide cultural awareness/education programs for the
   following events through poster production and video tape distribution:
     * National African-American History Month - February
     * American Asian Pacific Heritage Month - May
     * Woman's History Month - March
     * National Hispanic Heritage Month - September
     * National Disability Awareness Month - October
     * Native American Heritage Month - November

   Public Debt will provide posters highlighting the event to your agency
   designee for posting throughout your site, as well as posters
   announcing a showing of a videotape.

   We will provide your agency designee an appropriate videotape for a
   general showing to highlight each event. The primary focus of the video
   will be to educate; entertainment is secondary to education. Your
   designee will be responsible for receiving the tape, showing the tape,
   and returning it to BPD.

   Reporting

   Public Debt can provide a variety of reports that correspond to the
   services you elect to receive from us.

   Public Debt will determine the data required from your agency to
   complete the report and request it from your designee.

   On the basis of the information received, we will prepare the reports.
   Reports include, but are not limited to: the Affirmative
   Accomplishments Plan and Report, the Federal Equal Employment
   Opportunity Recruiting Plan, Annual Report of Counseling Activity and
   similar reports and responses required by the Equal Employment
   Opportunity Commission through your Departmental Offices.
