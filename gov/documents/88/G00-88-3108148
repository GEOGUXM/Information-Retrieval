   TO:        FEDHR Steering Committee
   FROM:      Director, Human Resources Service
   SUBJECT:   Time & Attendance Replacement System Selection

          In December 1998 we presented a demonstration of the three (3)
          candidate T&A systems to replace the existing TAIMS system. We
        requested that each OPDIV submit one vote for NIHs ITAS, FDAs EASE,
      Kronos or to wait until completion of the ERP Study being conducted by
      HRS. The results of the votes indicated that the majority of the OPDIVs
                 selected NIHs ITAS as the replacement T&A system.

      Based on this decision, HRS is actively pursuing obtaining the NIH ITAS
         software and procuring the necessary infrastructure hardware and
        software to implement ITAS. Our plan is to implement ITAS into the
       OPDIVs that expressed an interest for immediate replacement of TAIMS.
      For the OPDIVs wanting to delay implementing the replacement system we
                       will be contacting you in the future.

       We would like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to
         the T&A User Group and Steering Committee members who have done a
       tremendous job of reviewing and evaluating the potential timekeeping
      system replacements. This project has been in the works for three years
        and it was only through you and your staffs dedicated and hard work
      that we were able to reach this decision. This is the first of several
      significant decisions that we will make as a Steering Committee, and we
          look forward to working with you on these issues in the future.

         As always, contact me at jcolantuoni@psc.dhhs.gov if you have any
                              questions or concerns.
