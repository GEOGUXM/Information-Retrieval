   Oswald Theodore Avery (1877-1955) was a distinguished bacteriologist
   and research physician and one of the founders of immunochemistry. He
   is best known, however, as a discoverer that deoxyribonucleic acid
   (DNA) serves as genetic material. The Oswald T. Avery Collection is a
   part of the Joshua Lederberg Papers, which are at the National Library
   of Medicine and available digitally. The collection was assembled by
   Nobel laureate Dr. Lederberg because of the strong connection between
   Dr. Avery's work and his own. The work of Avery and his lab, observes
   Dr. Lederberg, was "the historical platform of modern DNA research" and
   "betokened the molecular revolution in genetics and biomedical science
   generally."
   Documents in the Avery Collection range from 1910 to the 1990s, the
   majority dating from the 1940s and from the 1960s to the present day.
   The collection contains laboratory notes, research reports, published
   articles and books, correspondence, unpublished manuscripts, speeches,
   photographic prints, and audiovisual materials.
   As part of its Profiles in ScienceÂ® project, the National Library of
   Medicine is digitizing and making available over the World Wide Web the
   majority of the Oswald T. Avery Collection, for use by educators and
   researchers. This Web site provides access to the portions of the
   Oswald T. Avery Collection that are now publicly available. We suggest
   that new visitors begin with the online Exhibit, which includes a small
   selection of documents and visuals, organized by subject. The Exhibit
   provides biographical information and short essays about Dr. Avery's
   work, and these lead to the digitized documents and visuals.
   In addition to the Exhibit, visitors may access the publicly available
   materials through Alphabetical or Chronological Listings. Documents and
   visuals in these lists are arranged by format and then either
   alphabetically by title or chronologically by date. A third way of
   accessing the publicly available materials is through a Search Engine,
   which searches for a text string in either the OCR of the scanned image
   or in the metadata, that is, information that the library has entered
   about each item in the full digital collection.
   As the National Library of Medicine adds materials to the Oswald T.
   Avery Collection, they will be made available to the public.
