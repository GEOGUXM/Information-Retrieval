                             SXI Status (2001-12-20)

     GOES 12 and SXI have successfully completed Post-Launch Testing (PLT).
     The spacecraft has been placed in a storage mode as of December 20,
     2001 as a backup to the currently operational GOES spacecraft. GOES 12
     and SXI will become operational when needed as a replacement for either
     GOES 8 or GOES 10. No new SXI data will be available until that time.

     However, there are plans to release FITS format data from the PLT
     period by the summer of 2002, when additional instrument performance
     analysis will have been completed.


                          SXI Data Online (2001-09-07)

     NOAA is pleased to announce that the first SXI images are now available
     for viewing.

     You may use this archive browser to view the first sequence of released
     images.

     Please consider these data preliminary. During this period of system
     testing, the image calibration algorithms will evolve, and the image
     collection sequence will be supporting instrument testing.

     The "basket" delivery system is currently configured to deliver browse
     imagery only. After the testing period is completed, that system will
     also deliver the archival image data in the FITS format.

     If you browser isn't configured to accept "cookies," the "basket"
     system will not work.


                                     Errata

     2001-10-03 17:47:08 GMT
     Beginning 2001-10-02 14:57:31, the browse images are incorrectly
     labeled with the month set to January. The problem persisted until
     2001-10-04 22:33:52.



                                    Contacts

     If you have questions about the SXI archive and this public interface
     please contact Daniel.C.Wilkinson@noaa.gov.

     If you have questions concerning the current status of the instrument,
     image processing, or image quality, please follow the Operations link
     to the Space Environment Center.


                               Product Development

     The SXI observation sequence will be calibrated to observe the low
     X-ray output from the Corona, moderate X-ray output of the Active
     Regions, and the very intense X-ray output of Solar Flares. Flares will
     cause pixel saturation to occur in the images calibrated for the
     Corona, and Active Regions.

     Data products, such as composite images, deconvoluted images, and
     animations sequences will be available in the futue, see the Greatest
     Hits page for samples.

     Each image in the spread sheet is linked to it's 576x512 counterpart.
     The long term plan is to launch an applet when clicking an image that
     will allow the user to change color, display a negative, adjust
     brightness and contrast, overlay coordinate grids, zoom and pan, etc.

     Users will be able to generate a movie from any Stream type table.


        BROWSE INSTRUCTIONS:
          * All times are Universal Time unless labeled otherwise.
          * The Execute button must be pressed in order to make changes in the
            display.
          * The Image width option (in pixels) allows the user to scale the
            size of the browse images.
               + The native size of the browse imagery is 576 x 512 pixels.
               + If you select a value < 180, a thumbnail image is used whose
                 native size is 128 x 128 pixels.
          * The number of Rows and Columns in the spread sheet can be adjusted
            to a maximum of 4.
          * The Interval setting will have a different affect, depending on the
            Table Type selected.
               + When Table Type is set to Column Compare, Interval is the time
                 interval between rows.
               + When Table Type is set to Stream, Interval is the time
                 interval between successive images.
          * There are two Table Types.
               + Column Compare allows a different image type to be selected
                 for each column. Column one is the control point for the time
                 constraint, i.e., when the interval is set to one hour, an
                 image for column one is found (at least) one hour from the
                 previous rows column one. The images in the other columns are
                 the next images, of the selected type, found after the column
                 one time.
               + Stream creates a sequence of images of a single image type.
                 The image in row one, column one, controls the image type and
                 the start time for the sequence.
          * < Step will shift the spread sheet view towards more recent data.
          * Step > will shift the spread sheet view towards older data.
               + Stepping up and down in the data base with these buttons may
                 not have symetric results, depending on the temporal
                 distribution of the data.
               + There is a slight complication that may arise when using these
                 buttons -- using the your browsers Back button immediately
                 afterwards will give unexpected results.
          * When Recent is checked, the first row always displays the most
            recent data in the data base.
          * To start the spread sheet on a date and time of your choosing,
            deselect Recent, and enter your time parameters: Y=year, M=month,
            D=day, H=hour, M=minute.
          * The Image Type displayed in each column can be selected from the
            drop list.
          * Meta Data for each image is displayed in a drop list, to compare a
            particular parameter between images, use the drop list to select
            that item in each image you are comparing.
            A Shopping Basket system is available for you to retrieve full
            resolution browse images, or data files in the FITS format.
          * If you press the Add to Basket button, the images in the display
            will added to your basket.
          * If you press the Empty Basket button, all images will be removed
            from the basket.
          * If you press the View Basket button, a second window will be opened
            that will display the contents of your basket.
               + You may specify browse images or FITS formatted data files.
               + Enter an e-mail address that will be used to notify you where
                 to retrieve your images.
               + The images in your order will be packed into ZIP files.
               + In order to make room for other data orders, please retrieve
                 your files within 3 hours of submitting your order. Files left
                 longer than 3 hours will be deleted.
          * Browse images will be in either .PNG or .JPG format. The Space
            Environment Center delivers browse imagery as .PNG files. NGDC
            converts them to .JPG each day in order to decrease the time
            required for them to be downloaded to the user.
