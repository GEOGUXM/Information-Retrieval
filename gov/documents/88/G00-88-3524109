  The information on this page is provided for individuals who plan to present
  posters at the 32nd Neural Prosthesis Workshop.

   Investigators who are not presently funded by the Neural Prosthesis
   Program are encouraged to present a poster at the workshop. Posters are
   placed in the lobby of the Lister Hill Center. Extended afternoon
   breaks are planned on Wednesday  and Thursday for poster viewing. If
   you are interested in presenting a poster, please check the poster box
   and enter a tentative title on the registration page.  If you have
   already registered, please send a message to the neural prosthesis
   program mail page mailto:npp@ninds.nih.gov.

   The poster board area is 4 by 8 feet. The boards and thumbtacks will be
   available starting on Wednesday morning. Posters should be taken down
   by 3:00 on Friday. Abstracts for the posters will be printed and
   collated before the workshop. The suggested format for abstract
   submission is a one page summary with the title printed using 14 point
   bold type. The author and affiliation lines follow in 12 point type.
   Text is in 12 point type with right and left justification. Text can
   run in one or two columns with the preference for two columns with a
   1/2 inch spacing between the columns. Use 1 inch margins on all edges.
   A font such as Times Roman is preferred.

   Please submit the poster abstract to npp@ninds.nih.gov (as an
   attachment if possible) by September 25th.

   A goal of the workshop is to discuss current problems limiting the
   development of neural prostheses. You should feel free to present new
   ideas, preliminary work and unresolved problems as well as completed
   work on your poster.
