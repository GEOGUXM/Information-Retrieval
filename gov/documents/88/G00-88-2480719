       The current Local Rules can be obtained here in pdf format.

       There is a committee currently in the process of examining the local
       rules and proposing revisions.  Subcommittee meetings are underway and
       it is planned that proposed revisions will be submitted to the Court
       for consideration by the Judges in the next coming months.

       These rules are current as of November 1, 2000.
