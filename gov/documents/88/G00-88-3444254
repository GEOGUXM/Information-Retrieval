   Improvements underway in
   Washington's Child Welfare System

      Washington's Child Welfare System is undergoing comprehensive reforms
      through the Department of Social and Health Services' Kids Come First
      Action Agenda.

      The first goal of Kids Come First is to ensure that the safety of
      children is a priority when making decisions about where children live
      when their parents are unable or unwilling to properly care for them.

      The department's aggressive effort to make long-lasting changes through
      new initiatives and continued reviews of current practice in the child
      welfare field will further protect children and better address their
      medical and emotional issues.

      A cornerstone of Kids Come First is a reform of Washington's foster
      care program, which is one of the most important elements of child
      welfare services. With approval from the Legislature and support from
      Casey Family Programs, DSHS has the goal of increasing the number of
      new foster families in Washington by 500 in the next year.

      Here is additional information about the child welfare reform in
