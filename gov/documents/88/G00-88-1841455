                           ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION

   Maine NRCS, in partnership with the 16 Soil and Water Conservation
   Districts and 5 Resource Conservation and Development Councils in the
   state, provides outreach and education services to schools and a
   variety of other organizations.  Educating both children and adults
   about the value of conservation is one of our primary goals.

   NRCS personnel assist our partners with education and outreach
   activities such as:
     * Outdoor classrooms and events
     * Indoor classroom presentations and activities
     * Fairs and demonstrations

         Maine Association of Conservation Districts Education Committee
   coordinated events:
     * Maine Regional and State Envirothons - a natural resource
       problem-solving competition for high school students
       Learning Results -- Much More Than a Competition...
     * Natural Resources Institute - a summer workshop for teachers, youth
       leaders and other educators interested in Maine's environmental
       issues and natural resources
