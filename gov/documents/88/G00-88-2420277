   Freedom of Information Act.       The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
   requires federal agencies to make information available to the public.
   The NTSB makes most of its information available in the public
   reference room in Washington, D.C., on the web site, or through
   contractors (for a fee).

   If the information is already available, you do not need to make a
   FOIA request. A written FOIA request should be used only when
   information you're seeking is not already available.

   Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about FOIA

   How do I obtain information?
   First, check to see if the information you want is already available.
       If it is already available, you do not need to submit a
       FOIA request. Instead, you may download the information, or request
       a copy from Public Inquiries Branch. A complete description of the
       types of data and information products and how to obtain them is
       listed on the web site.

   What if I can't find the information I'm looking for?
   Call the NTSB Public Inquiries Branch at (800) 877-6799. They can
       assist you in locating information; if the information you seek is
       not already available, they can instruct you when a FOIA request
       would be appropriate.

   What does FOIA cover?
   FOIA covers information that is not already publicly available.
       Fulfillment of a FOIA request depends on the records under an
       agency's control, and whether the information qualifies for
       exemption as described under Denial of Request. Agencies are not
       required to do research for you, analyze data, or create records in
       order to respond to a request.

   How do I submit a FOIA?
   Anyone may submit a FOIA request, but it must be in writing. Send
       requests directly to our central office in Washington, D.C. in
       order to avoid processing delays. If you have any questions before
       you submit a request, or during the time we are processing it, call
       the FOIA office at (202) 314-6540 or (800) 877-6799.
       Mail requests to:

   The National Transportation Safety Board
       Attention: FOIA Officer, RE-51
       490 L'Enfant Plaza, S.W.
       Washington, DC 20594-2000

   or fax: (202) 314-6598

   or via the web using the request form

   What happens after I submit a FOIA request?
   The Safety Board processes FOIA requests immediately on receipt.
       However, since we are a small agency, it may take time to collect
       the information you seek. If you request information about an
       accident that just occurred or we are still investigating, and if a
       preliminary report is available, we will release the preliminary
       report and other docket information as it becomes available.

   What happens if I don't get the information I asked for?
   The Safety Board denies a FOIA request, in whole or in part, only if it
       falls under one of nine statutory exemptions of the FOIA. The four
       most common exemptions under which the Board withholds information
       (with reference to the NTSB regulation on Public Availability of
       Information) are as follows :

     * 5 USC 552 (b)(5), draft reports & staff analysis (see 49 CFR
       801.54);
     * 5 USC 552 (b)(6), personal information, where a personal interest
       in privacy outweighs a public interest in release, this includes
       graphic photographs of injuries in accidents and autopsy reports
       (see 49 CFR 801.55);
     * 5 USC 552 (b)(4), Trade Secrets and/or confidential
       financial/commercial information submitted by private persons or
       corporations to the NTSB in the course of an investigation (see 49
       CFR 801.59); and
     * 5 USC 552 (b)(3), information protected from release by another
       statute (see 49 CFR 801.53). This includes information such as:

     * Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) tapes. Release of the tapes is
       prohibited by 49 USC 1114(c). However, the Board will release a CVR
       transcript [edited or unedited], the timing of such release is also
       controlled by statute - 49 USC 1114(c)(B);
     * Voluntarily provided safety-related information. 49 USC 1114(b)(3)
       prohibits the release of such information if it is not related to
       the exercise of the Board's accident or incident investigation
       authority and if the Board finds that the disclosure would inhibit
       the voluntary provision of that type of information; and
     * Records or information relating to the NTSB's participation in
       foreign aircraft accident investigations. 49 USC 1114(e) prohibits
       the release of this information before the country conducting the
       investigation releases its report or 2 years following the
       accident, whichever occurs first.

       If we deny your request, our letter advising you of the denial will
       explain why and also advise you of your right to appeal the
       determination.

   How do I appeal a denial?
   There is no specific form or format for an appeal, but it must be in
       writing, and should be clearly labeled as an appeal to a denied
       FOIA request. The appeal should include:

     * The initial request number which was assigned to your case
     * The date of the action on your request
     * The legal basis for your appeal (i.e., why you think we should
       release the information we withheld in an initial determination)

   If you believe additional records exist, please specify why you think
   such records exist and, if possible, where you think they might be
   located. Address your appeal to:
   National Transportation Safety Board
       Attn: Managing Director
       490 L'Enfant Plaza, SW
       Washington, DC 20594

   What if my appeal is denied?
   After you receive the response to your appeal, if you believe the
       Safety Board has not handled your case properly or that the Safety
       Board has wrongfully withheld information, you may challenge our
       action in a lawsuit filed in Federal Court. Our letter to you on
       your appeal will inform you of this right.
