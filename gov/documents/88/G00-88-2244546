   This three-dimensional perspective view was created from an Advanced
   Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Digital
   Elevation Model combined with a simulated natural color ASTER image,
   acquired July 13, 2001. It shows El Misti volcano towering 5822 meters
   high above the second city of Peru, Arequipa, with a population of more
   than one million. Geologic studies indicate that El Misti has had five
   minor eruptions this century, and a major eruption in the 15th century
   when residents were forced to flee the city. Despite the obvious
   hazard, civil defense authorities see it as a remote danger, and city
   planners are not avoiding development on the volcano side of the city.
   This view shows human development extending up the flanks of the
   volcano along gullies which would form natural channels for flows of
   lava, superheated ash and gas, or melted ice, snow, and mud from the
   summit snowfield in the event of an eruption.
