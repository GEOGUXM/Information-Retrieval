   About the VA Research Service


   General Description and History of Research Program

   The research program at the Iowa City VA Medical Center (ICVAMC) has
   been in existence for over forty years. There are currently over 23
   active projects being reported on by 120 active investigators. Major
   programs exist in the areas of diabetes and endocrinology, infectious
   diseases and immune disorders, cardiovascular diseases and
   complications, and basic sciences. A VA/JDF Diabetes Research Center
   (DRC) and a NIH Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center (DERC) are
   based at the ICVAMC. The predominant source of VA funding at the ICVAMC
   has been from Medical Research Service. New programs in HSR&D have
   received funding in the last two years. Current HSR&D funding exceed
   $600,00/year.

   Future plans for research at the ICVAMC are aimed at diversifying the
   program. This diversification includes efforts to develop an active and
   viable clinical and health services/outcomes research program. Examples
   of activities to achieve this objective include the recent increase
   over the past two years of $480,917 HSR&D funding, and the recently
   approved HSR&D Research Career Development (RCD) Award. Recruitment of
   an individual with health services and outcomes research experience and
   funding to serve as a mentor to others has been successful. In
   addition, the ICVAMC established a non-profit research foundation
   (tax-exempt status received in January 1998). This non-profit
   foundation has less than $200,000 in assets as of March 1998.
