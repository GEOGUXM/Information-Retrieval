                           Overview

                           In November 1989, San Bernardino County voters approved passage of
   Measure I authorizing the San Bernardino County Transportation
   Authority to impose a one-half of one percent retail transactions and
   use tax applicable in the incorporated and unincorporated territory of
   the County of San Bernardino for a period not to exceed twenty years.
   San Bernardino Associated Governments (SANBAG), acting as the
   Authority, is authorized to administer the programs described in the
   Measure.  Revenue from the tax can only be used for transportation
   improvement and traffic management programs authorized in the
   Expenditure Plan set forth in Ordinance No. 89-1.

   Following is a summary of the categories of expenditures contained in
   the Measure.  For more specific guidance, refer to Ordinance 89-1, a
   copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix I.

                           VALLEY EXPENDITURE PLAN

   Major Projects.  This category provide for expenditures necessary for
   the construction and/or improvement of highways within the San
   Bernardino Valley area, including Interstate 10, Interstate 215, State
   Route 30, State Route 60, and State Route 71.

   Local Distribution.  This category of Measure I revenue is distributed
   to the cities and County within the Valley region on a per capita basis
   using the most recent State Department of Finance estimates of city and
   unincorporated county population.  Revenues in this category shall be
   expended on streets and roads pursuant to a Twenty-Year Transportation
   Plan and a Five-Year Capital Improvement Program adopted by resolution
   of the local jurisdictions. The transportation plan and improvement
   program shall be updated annually and available for public

   Arterial Program.  The arterial program shall fund improvements to
   major thoroughfares within the Valley region.  Expenditures for
   projects funded by the arterial program shall be undertaken pursuant to
   the Twenty-Year Transportation Plan and Five-Year Capital Improvement
   Program adopted by the Authority.  The transportation plan and
   improvement program shall be updated annually and made available for
   public review.

   Commuter Rail Program.  Commuter rail expenditures shall include
   purchase and/or preservation of rail rights-of-way for, 1) a San
   Bernardino-West Valley-Los Angeles corridor; 2) a San
   Bernardino-Riverside-Orange County corridor; and 3) other rail linkages
   within San Bernardino County.  Expenditures shall also be made for
   development of a comprehensive rail transit plan and other acquisitions
   necessary for the development and operation of major rail facilities.

   Elderly and Handicapped Transit Program.  Funds in this category shall
   be expended annually for a program of reduced fares and enhanced
   service for elderly and handicapped transit users in the Valley region,
   to be developed by the Authority in cooperation with transit service
   agencies.

   Traffic Management Implementation and Environmental Enhancement
   Program.  Expenditures within this category shall include projects for
   both traffic management and environmental enhancement planning in the
   Valley region.

                      MOUNTAIN/DESERT EXPENDITURE PLAN

   The Mountain/Desert region is defined as the Victor Valley, North
   Desert, Colorado River, Morongo Basin, and Mountain Subareas.  Revenue
   generated within the subareas shall be returned to each subarea, where
   local representatives shall make decisions related to revenue
   expenditure.  Revenues will be accounted for separately for each
   subarea and allocated based upon a formula of population (50%) and
   sales tax generation (50%).

   Measure I funds within the Mountain/Desert region shall be expended 65%
   for arterial and regional needs which include state highways; 30% for
   local needs; and 5% for elderly and handicapped transportation services
   and fare reductions.  If the full 65% is not needed for regional
   projects, the balance may be added to the local portion.

   Subarea representatives shall agree on a regional road network upon
   which funds slated for arterial improvements may be used by each
   jurisdiction as deemed appropriate.  Funds for local improvements will
   be controlled by each local jurisdiction, as well as the local share of
   transit funds.  Each jurisdiction shall adopt a Five-Year Capital
   Improvement Program and a Twenty-Year Transportation Plan which shall
   be consistent with other local and regional plans.
