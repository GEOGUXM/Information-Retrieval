   Accomplishments 1999-2000 > Serving Ohio First

   Senator George V. Voinovich

   Report on the 106^th Congress, 1999-2000

   SERVING OHIO FIRST

   Listening and Serving

   Senator George Voinovich lives in the same Cleveland neighborhood where
   he grew up and returns to Ohio almost every weekend. His top priority
   is to meet with Ohioans and learn firsthand what are their thoughts and
   needs. Whether it's holding hearings in Nelsonville on the needs of
   Appalachia, meeting with workers at Piketon's uranium plant, roundtable
   discussions with agriculture leaders, visiting Central State University
   to learn about the school's new master plan, touring the GM Powertrain
   plant in Defiance, or meeting with big city leaders on how to improve
   schools, infrastructure and neighborhoods, Voinovich keeps a busy
   schedule criss-crossing Ohio to be accessible to the people he serves.

   Reaching Out and Staying in Touch

   Voinovich has an active statewide presence through five regional
   representatives located in four offices across Ohio. These members of
   Voinovich's outreach team regularly travel throughout the state to work
   with local community leaders to see how the federal government can help
   them implement local solutions to local problems. Ohioans meet
   personally with outreach team members during office hours held in each
   one of Ohio's 88 counties every year.

   Often representing Voinovich at community meetings when the Senate is
   in session, his Ohio outreach team regularly-sometimes
   hourly-communicates back to the Senator the progress of key projects
   and the thoughts and views of those with whom they meet.

   Helping Ohioans Solve Problems

   Two senators fighting for you are better than one, which is why
   Voinovich teamed up with U.S. Senator Mike DeWine-Ohio's senior
   senator-to form a joint office to work on problems that Ohioans have
   with federal agencies and programs. The joint operation also helps save
   Ohioans time and money trying to contact both senators, and saves
   office space and personnel costs. It is evidence of Voinovich's
   continued commitment to working harder and smarter and doing more with
   less.

   All cases are worked jointly by the two senators and all letters on
   behalf of Ohioans to government agencies bear both senator's
   signatures. During the 106^th Congress the office worked on more than
   7,800 cases for Ohioans and responded to more than 24,000 letters.

   Comments on Joint Casework Office

   "Your idea of a joint casework staff will eliminate... duplication and
   result in a cost savings to the Department of Veterans Affairs,"
   (Phillip J. Ross, director of the Veterans Affairs regional office)
   Ross said.

   "The office also saves money. The senators estimate that by combining
   staffs, they save $80,000 a year in salaries"

   DeWine-Voinovich teamwork paying off: Only in Ohio and Missouri do both
   U.S. senators share an office for constituent matters.

   (The Columbus Dispatch, June 4, 2000)

   "The partnership benefits Ohioans. Not only will DeWine and Voinovich
   generate double the clout in solving problems that people have with
   federal agencies, but they also will create an economy of shared
   function. Instead of having two constituent offices, they'll have one
   in Columbus. And it will be as close as the telephone."
