   This site is just one of many that provides information and resources
   on organ donation and transplantation issues. You should come back and
   visit as this site changes periodically to address the organ donation
   awareness initiatives that are in effect throughout the country and
   focus on different populations and issues.

   If you want more information on specific organ donation and
   transplantation topics of other organizations involved in organ
   donation and transplantation, feel free to link to them.

   This site was created by:
     * Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)
     * Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)

   The Division of Transplantation (DoT) of the Office of Special Programs
   manages contracts with the Organ Procurement and Transplantation
   Network (OPTN), the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients
   (SRTR), and the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP).

   DoT also has responsibility for conducting public and professional
   education initiatives to improve awareness of organ and tissue
   transplantation as a successful treatment option, and ultimately, to
   increase donation in the United States.
