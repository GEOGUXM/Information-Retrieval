Journals and Newspapers
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Technical Library has a large collection of both bound and unbound
   journals: about 1,800 titles total, including over 500 current print
   journal subscriptions. The Library's collection of journals and other
   serials includes, but is not limited to, professional and technical
   journals, newsletters, society publications, and other regularly issued
   publications. We also have access to over 525 Electronic Journals Full
   Text! (LaRC Only).

   Note: The IEEE Explore database (with IEEE journals) is no longer
   available. This service was provided by the NASA STI Office. Contact
   JoAnne Rocker / j.rocker@larc.nasa.gov (49475) for further information.

ACCESS:


     * LaRC online titles.
     * Elsevier /ScienceDirect titles

   Our online catalog, NASA GALAXIE, contains general information about
   the journals in our collection, such as holdings information. You may
   contact the Reference Desk for more information about specific issues
   of a particular journal.

   The print journal collection is housed on the third floor of the
   Library in the Reading Room. Older, permanently bound volumes of
   journals are located along one wall of the Reading Room. They are
   alphabetized A to Z by journal name or by society name when appropriate
   (i.e., Proceedings of the IEEE are shelved under IEEE).

   The most recent issue of each journal is kept on the low shelving unit
   in the center of the Reading Room. If you do not see the issue that you
   need there, you can ask at the Serials Department. Other current (but
   not most recent) issues are located in a special shelving area within
   the Serials Department, where they remain until they are sent to the
   bindery.
