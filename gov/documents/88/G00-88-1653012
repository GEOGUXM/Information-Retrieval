                            Using the World-Wide-Web

   Using the World-Wide-Web involves communication between two types of
   programs. One type is a browser and the other is a server. The browser
   is the program that you run to look at the Web. There are many
   browsers. The two that we have tested are

   Mosaic
   This program is a graphical browser that runs on UNIX workstation using
   X windows, or Macintoshes, or PC's with Windows. This program can
   display some graphics directly and uses external programs like
   ghostview to display postscript or xv to display gif files. The
   external programs needed are listed in the documentation.

   This is the prefered way to browse the Web. Mosaic used to be called
   xmosaic. It is available precompiled for many machines by anonymous ftp
   from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Mosaic is available on most Fermilab machines
   by using the commands
      setup www
      xmosaic

   Lynx
   This program works on VT100 type terminals. It cannot display graphics,
   but it can download graphics files. This browser is well suited to
   people with slow network connections. If you can telnet and ftp you can
   use this browser.

   I have tested this browser with an xterm, Decterm, and a Wyse VT220
   equivalent. It works very well. I have run it from my home over the
   phone lines with a 2400 baud modem. In my experience I have found only
   one problem with this browser. It did not allow downloading to a local
   file when I used the xterm. It did work correctly for the Decterm and
   the Wyse terminal. I fixed the problem with the xterm by adding the
   line
       DOWNLOADER:Save to local disk:cp %s %s:TRUE

   to the file lynx.cfg.

   This browser is available by anonymous ftp from ftp2.cc.ukans.edu.
   There are precompiled binaries for sun, ibm, ultrix and the vax.

   Server software should not be a concern unless you wish to set up your
   own server away from Fermilab. If you are interested there are many
   different servers. The one we run on fn781a is the CERN server.
