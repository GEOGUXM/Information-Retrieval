   RV Model

   SHARP-B2, a follow-on flight test to SHARP-B1 successfully flown in
   1997, demonstrated the performance of 1-mm radius Ultra-High
   Temperature Ceramic (UHTC) leading edges at Mach numbers greater than
   22 and altitudes greater than 43 km. Four UHTC leading edge strakes
   were flown on a modified USAF Mk12 reentry vehicle. The launch vehicle
   was a Minuteman III. A successful mission was flown September 28, 2000.
   SHARP-B2 impacted the Kwajalein lagoon at the designated target point
   and was recovered October 1.

   Animations of the flight test are also available.
