               Current Disaster News and Program Updates ....

   The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is in the process of
   preparing a draft programatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) for
    the Emergency Watershed Protection Program. The PEIS will replace the
     current PEIS that was prepared in 1975. NRCS has been conducting a
    comprehensive review of the program which could result in substantive
   changes to improve the environmental, economic, and technical soundness
       of the activities conducted under the program. As a part of the
     process, NRCS has conducted six SCOPING sessions across the United
       States to obtain public and agency concerns with, and ideas for
         improving, the program. The SCOPING meetings were held in:

                       Kansas City, Missouri (9/29/98)

                       College Park, Georgia (10/6/98)

                      Sacramento, California (10/8/98)

                      Bloomington, Minnesota (10/20/98)

                         Albany, New York (10/22/98)

                          Washington DC (10/26/98)

    Some of the proposed changes that NRCS is considering for the program
     and which were presented and discussed during the scoping sessions
                                  include:

     [redball.gif] Use of floodplain easements in lieu of traditional
     recovery work.

     [redball.gif] Dedicating 15% of the monies appropriated by Congress
     for purchasing floodplain easements.

     [redball.gif] Eliminating the use of the terms "exigency" and
     "nonexigency".

     [redball.gif] Establishing a cost share rate at up to 75 for all but
     limited resource sponsors who may receive up to 90%.

     [redball.gif] Stipulate that proposed measures must be economically,
     socially, and environmentally defensible.

     [redball.gif] Stipulate that urgent and compelling situations be
     handled immediately after discovery.

     [redball.gif] Allow organizations certified by the IRS as 501c
     organizations to become sponsors of floodplain easements.

     [redball.gif] Use of Disaster Assistance Recovery Teams (DARTS) to
     train NRCS employees.

     [redball.gif] Evaluate ways to better coordinate EWP with other
     available emergency programs.

   NRCS will be evaluating the above changes, variations of these changes,
   comments and suggestions received during the scoping process, and a NO
     CHANGE policy. It is estimated that a draft PEIS will be ready for
                   public commment in the Spring of 1999.
