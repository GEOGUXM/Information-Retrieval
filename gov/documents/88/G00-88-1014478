   Subject: International Aviation In-flight Advisories

   Reference(s):WSOM Chapter D-38, Transmittal Issuance 88-5 dated May 27,
   1988

   This OML reassigns international meteorological watch office
   responsibility, adjusts their areas of responsibility, and revises the
   use of alpha designators.

   I.    Reassigned areas in Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico

   The restructuring of the International Aviation Services Program
   involving Meteorological Watch Offices (MWO) in the listed areas were
   phased in with the high seas and satellite program implementations at
   the National Meteorological Center (NMC), and the National Hurricane
   Center (NHC). NMC assumed the SIGMET responsibility of the Washington
   Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO) on May 7, 1989, and NHC assumed
   the SIGMET responsibility of WSFO Miami and WSFO San Juan on July 1.

   II.    Reassigned and adjusted areas in the Pacific

   The program restructuring for the Pacific becomes effective 0000 UTC,
   September 13, 1989. It involves reassigning responsibility for
   International SIGMET's and adjusting MWO areas of responsibility. NMC
   and NHC will assume the SIGMET responsibility of WSFO's San Francisco
   and Anchorage, as well as part of Honolulu's area, all in the Oakland
   Oceanic Flight Information Region (FIR).

   The revised areas of responsibility are shown on attachment 1, 2, and 3
   which supersedes and replaces the outlined areas of responsibility
   shown in Appendix A-l through A-4 of WSOM Chapter D-38.   Attachment 4
   which supersedes Appendix B-l of WSOM Chapter D-38, lists the MWO's and
   communications headers.

   III.     Reassignment of Alpha Designators

   The reassignment of and revised policy on alpha designators for
   International SIGMET's will also be effective on September 13. MWO's
   Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, Honolulu, NHC, and NMC are assigned the
   use of alpha designators ALFA through MIKE within each of their areas.
   MWO Guam is assigned the use of alpha designators NOVEMBER, OSCAR, and
   PAPA.

   These assignments have been coordinated with the Domestic In-flight
   Advisory Program. With the updated WSOM Chapter D-22, the domestic
   program designators will be limited to SIERRA, TANGO, or ZULU for
   AIRMET's and the remaining designators from NOVEMBER to YANKEE for
   domestic SIGMET's.

   IV.    Revised Policy on Alpha Designators

   With the same alpha designators for each MWO, the International program
   can be conducted similar to the Domestic program. That is, the first
   issuance of a SIGMET for a phenomenon will be assigned the next unused
   alpha designator for the respective ocean area, and that designator
   will be retained as the phenomenon crosses an MWO or Oceanic FIR
   boundary or until a SIGMET is no longer required.

   For example, the progression of alpha designators in the SIGMET
   preamble for a phenomenon moving from the Anchorage Continental (MWO
   Anchorage) to the Oakland Oceanic (MWO NMC) FIR's is as follows:

   Last SIGMET by Anchorage
   WSPNl PANC 051757
   (PAZA SIGMET CHARLIE 3 VALID 051810/052210 PANC
   Text)

   First SIGMET by NMC
   NSPN03 KWBC 052145
   KZOA PAZA SIGMET CHARLIE 4 VALID 052210/060210 KWBC
   (Text)

     Note: The first issuance by NMC includes both KZOA and PAZA
     indicating that at least part of the phenomenon still resides in the
     PAZA area.

   Determining the next unused alpha designator requires MWO's to receive
   all of the international SIGMET's issued in the ocean area for which an
   MWO has responsibility. For example, Miami and Washington must store
   all issuances since there is a responsibility in both ocean areas,
   whereas the other MWO's (except Guam) need only store SlGMET's for the
   Pacific area.

   V.    Revised Area of Responsibility for Alaska MWO's

   The boundary between MWO's Anchorage and Juneau will be changed
   effective September 13, 1989. The boundary's northern point will be
   moved northwesterly from 59N 137W to 60.SN 141W and extend to the
   unchanged point at 55N 145W.

   VI.    Other instructions

   The policy pertaining to the use and successive numbering of alpha
   designators does not apply to the boundary between the domestic and
   oceanic FIR's. However, coordination by product is expected whenever
   possible.

   The external distribution requirements for international SIGMET's
   prepared by the U.S. MWO's as shown in Appendix D of WSOM Chapter D-38
   should be changed as follows.

                        Old                       New
                        San Francisco (WSPAl KSFO)
                        San Juan (WSCA TJSJ)      Washington (WSPN03 KWBC)
                                                  and Miami (WSPA04 KMIA)
                                                  Miami (WSCA KMIA)
