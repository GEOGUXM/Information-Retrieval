                           The Observer's Tool Corner

   Here is a collection of tools designed for the solar system observer.
   Although most of these tools are general in nature, some were designed
   specifically for the small-body observer. If you would like to see
   additional tools added or changes made to existing tools, please send
   your suggestions to the Webmaster shown at the bottom of this page.

Tools Currently Available

     * Ephemeris Generation - for all the planets, natural satellites,
       asteroids and comets is available via a new forms-based interface.
     * Object Identification - given an observation date, location, and
       region of sky (and optionally other constraints), find all
       asteroids and comets matching the constraints within the region.
     * What's Observable Tonight? - given an observation date, location,
       and constraints (such as maximum magnitude and maximum zenith
       distance), find all asteroids and comets that are ``observable'' on
       that night.

Tools Under Construction

     * Universal Time Converter - given a date/time in one of several
       different forms, display all other forms of that date/time. For
       example, given a Gregorian calendar date and time, display the
       Julian date, day of year, etc.
