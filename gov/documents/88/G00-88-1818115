   Lake or Streambed Alteration Notification and Agreements

   Purpose
   The Department of Fish and Game (Department) is responsible for
   conserving, protecting, and managing California's fish, wildlife, and
   native plant resources.

   To meet this responsibility, the law requires any person , state or
   local government agency, or public utility proposing a project that may
   impact a river, stream, or lake to notify the Department before
   beginning the project.

   If the Department determines that the project may adversely affect
   existing  fish and wildlife resources, a Lake or Streambed Alteration
   Agreement is required.
