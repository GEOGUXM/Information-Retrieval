   NSRIC's Swine Odor and Manure Management Research Building in Ames, IA

   The Swine Odor and Manure Management Research Unit is part of the
   National Swine Research and Information Center in Ames, IA. The mission
   of this unit is to solve critical problems in the swine production
   industry that impact production efficiency, environmental quality, and
   human health. Multidisciplinary research teams in the areas of
   microbiology, chemistry, genetics, nutrition, and engineering, generate
   and integrate knowledge for evaluation and development of new
   management practices that increase swine health and productivity, while
   minimizing nutrient excretion, producion of odor and gaseous emissions,
   and release of pathogens into the environment.
   This mission is directed toward two goals.
   First:(1) Determine the effect of alternative diet formulations on
   excretion of odor while optimizing performance; (2) Localize (map),
   characterize, and alter the in situ microflora of the pig gut to reduce
   odor production and improve nutritent utilization; and (3) Determine
   the role of the endogenous pig gut on the population of microbes that
   reside within the gut.
   Second: (1) Develop methodology to measure and evaluate swine manure
   management and farm and herd practices on bacterial and parasitic
   zoonotic pathogens; (2) Evaluate the effects of potential solutions to
   control zoonotic pathogens on the swine production enterprise and the
   feasibility of management changes; (3) Provide strategies and decision
   aid tools for swine producers that minimize and/or eliminate zoonotic
   pathogens which may enter the environment, particularly as they may be
   transmitted to human food.
