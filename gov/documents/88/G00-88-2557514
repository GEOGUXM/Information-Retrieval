   New Magnetic Refrigerator

   An Ames Laboratory researcher has discovered a new class of magnetic
   refrigeration materials that could revolutionize air conditioning and
   refrigeration.

   Karl Gschneider pushes the boundaries of new refrigeration technology.

      January 7, 2002Using materials developed at the U.S. Department of
      Energy's Ames Laboratory, researchers have successfully demonstrated
      the world's first room temperature, permanent-magnet, magnetic
      refrigerator. The refrigerator was developed by Milwaukee-based
      Astronautics Corporation of America as part of a cooperative research
      and development agreement with Ames Laboratory.

      Instead of ozone-depleting refrigerants and energy-consuming
      compressors found in conventional vapor-cycle refrigerators, this new
      style of refrigerator uses gadolinium metal that heats up when exposed
      to a magnetic field, then cools down when the magnetic field is
      removed.

      "We're witnessing history in the making," Ames Laboratory senior
      metallurgist Karl Gschneidner Jr. says of the revolutionary device.
      "Previous successful demonstration refrigerators used large
      superconducting magnets, but this is the first to use a permanent
      magnet and operate at room temperature."

      Initially tested in September at the Astronautics Corporation of
      America's Technology Center in Madison, Wisconsin, the new refrigerator
      is undergoing further testing. The goal is to achieve larger
      temperature swings that will allow the technology to provide the
      cooling power required for specific markets, such as home
      refrigerators, air conditioning, electronics cooling, and fluid
      chilling.

      According to Gschneidner, who is also a Professor of Materials Science
      and Engineering at Iowa State University, the magnetic refrigerator
      employs a rotary design. It consists of a wheel that contains segments
      of gadolinium powdersupplied by Ames Laboratoryand a high-powered,
      rare earth permanent magnet.

      The wheel is arranged to pass through a gap in the magnet where the
      magnetic field is concentrated. As it passes through this field, the
      gadolinium in the wheel exhibits a large magnetocaloric effectit heats
      up. After the gadolinium enters the field, water is circulated to draw
      the heat out of the metal. As the material leaves the magnetic field,
      it cools further as a result of the magnetocaloric effect. A second
      stream of water is then cooled by the gadolinium. This water is then
      circulated through the refrigerator's cooling coils. The overall result
      is a compact unit that runs virtually silent and nearly vibration free,
      without the use of ozone-depleting gases, a dramatic change from the
      vapor-compression-style refrigeration technology in use today.

      "The permanent magnets and the gadolinium don't require any energy
      inputs to make them work," Gschneidner said, "so the only energy it
      takes is the electricity for the motors to spin the wheel and drive the
      water pumps."

      Though the test further proves the technology works, two recent
      developments at Ames Laboratory could lead to even greater advances on
      the magnetic refrigeration frontier. Gschneidner and fellow Ames
      Laboratory researchers Sasha Pecharsky and Vitalij Pecharsky have
      developed a process for producing kilogram quantities of
      Gd[5](Si[2]Ge[2]) alloy using commercial-grade gadolinium.
      Gd[5](Si[2]Ge[2]) exhibits a giant magnetocaloric effect, which offers
      the promise to outperform the gadolinium powders used in the current
      rotary refrigerator.

      When the alloy was first discovered in 1996, the process used
      high-purity gadolinium and resulted in small quantities (less than 50
      grams). However, when lower-quality commercial-grade gadolinium was
      used, the magnetocaloric effect was only a fraction, due mainly to
      interstitial impurities, especially carbon. The new process overcomes
      the deleterious effect of these impurities, making it viable to use
      less expensive commercial-grade gadolinium to achieve roughly the same
      magnetocaloric effect as the original discovery.

      At the same time, Ames Lab researchers David Jiles and Seong-Jae Lee,
      along with Vitalij Pecharsky and Gschneidner, have designed a permanent
      magnet configuration capable of producing a stronger magnetic field.
      The new magnet can produce a magnetic field nearly twice as high as
      that produced by the magnet used in the initial refrigerator, an
      important advance since the output and efficiency of the refrigerator
      is generally proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. The
      group has filed patent applications on both the gadolinium alloy
      process and the permanent magnet.

      "These are important advances, but it will require additional testing
      to see how much they will enhance refrigeration capabilities,"
      Gschneidner said. "Progress (in this field) is measured in small steps
      and this is just another of those steps. However, we've come a long way
      since first announcing the giant magnetocaloric alloy five years
      ago."by Kerry Gibson
