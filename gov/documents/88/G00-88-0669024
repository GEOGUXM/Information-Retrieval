                              CALFED Task Force

   The Governor's Office for Innovation in Government has partnered with
   the CALFED Bay-Delta Program to streamline traditional government
   business practices. The CALFED program is the largest ecosystem
   restoration and water management program in the United States. The
   program seeks to develop and implement a long-term, comprehensive plan
   to restore ecological health and improve water management for
   beneficial uses of the San Francisco - Bay-Delta region. Gov. Gray
   Davis has hailed the CALFED program as "a balanced, responsible
   approach to water management."
