                                 Space Work

     Shuttle and station astronauts perform many tasks as they orbit the
        Earth. The space shuttle is a versatile vehicle that provides
     facilities to perform science experiments, release and capture huge
   satellites and even assemble the International Space Station. However,
   the space shuttle was only designed to fly in space for about two and a
                            half weeks at a time.

     The space station, on the other hand, is designed to be a permanent
   orbiting research facility. Its major purpose is to perform world-class
       science and research that only the microgravity environment can
        provide. The station crew spends their day working on science
   experiments that require their input, as well as monitoring those that
       are controlled from the ground. They also take part in medical
   experiments to determine how well their bodies are adjusting to living
                  with no gravity for long periods of time.

    Working on the space station also means ensuring the maintenance and
    health of the orbiting platform. Crewmembers are constantly checking
     support systems and cleaning filters, updating computer equipment -
    doing many of the things a homeowner must do to ensure their largest
    investment stays in good shape. Similarly, Mission Control constantly
   monitors the space station and sends messages each day through voice or
     e-mail with new instructions or plans to assist the crew members in
                            their daily routine.

      Before the International Space Station and the Russian Mir space
    station, the space shuttle was the only vehicle that NASA astronauts
     could live and work on for days at a time. The space shuttle would
   deliver satellites to space that could broadcast communications or peer
       into the edge of the universe. Of course, the crewmembers would
    carefully check all systems before finally releasing a satellite into
                                Earth orbit.

   Telescope.

    Probably the most famous satellite released from the space shuttle's
       payload bay is the Hubble Space Telescope. The shuttle has even
      returned to space three times with replacement parts destined for
     Hubble. Before the Hubble can be fitted with new parts, though, an
    astronaut must use the shuttle's robotic arm to capture the satellite
    and then maneuver it inside the payload bay where it can be secured.
    Then, space walkers venture into the payload bay, climb up the Hubble
   Space Telescope and install the new parts. After ground controllers are
    sure the Hubble Space Telescope is in good condition, the robotic arm
            grabs the satellite then releases it back into space.

     Research beneficial to life on Earth has been performed inside the
    space shuttle. For instance, protein crystals grown in space provide
    researchers insights into stronger, safer medications here on Earth.
      Plants grown in space help scientists learn how to grow healthier
      stronger plants on Earth. Plant experiments also help researchers
   understand the implications of feeding astronauts on long-term missions
   beyond low-Earth orbit. Studies have also been performed on astronauts
         themselves, mostly in an effort to determine the effects of
                   microgravity on human bone and tissue.

   Do astronauts get weekends and holidays off?

     *
       Yes, and they get to come home for the holidays!
     *
       Yes, but they are on call 24 hours a day.
     *
       No, because the space station orbits Earth permanently.
     *
       Sometimes, though it's impossible to land in time for a holiday.
