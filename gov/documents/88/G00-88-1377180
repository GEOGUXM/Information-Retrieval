   DOT Releases Report Assessing Vulnerability Of Transportation
   Infrastructure Relying on Global Positioning System


   The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) today released the results
   of a study assessing the vulnerability of the national transportation
   infrastructure that relies on the Global Positioning System (GPS).


   The study notes that GPS is susceptible to unintentional disruption
   from such causes as atmospheric effects, signal blockage from
   buildings, and interference from communications equipment, as well as
   to potential deliberate disruption.  It contains a number of
   recommendations to address the possibility of disruption and ensure the
   safety of the national transportation infrastructure.


   The report was mandated by a Presidential Decision Directive and
   prepared by the DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems Center.


   This report provides a roadmap for addressing possible vulnerabilities
   in GPS so that we can continue maintaining the highest standards of
   transportation safety, said U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Y.
   Mineta.  The Department of Transportation takes this reports findings
   very seriously, and we will be working to ensure that GPS will fulfill
   its potential as a key element of the nations transportation
   infrastructure.


   Secretary Mineta charged the administrators of each DOT operating
   administration to thoroughly review this report and consider the
   adequacy of backup systems for each area of operation in which GPS is
   being used for critical transportation applications.  The
   administrators are to report their findings back to the Secretary
   within 60 days.


   DOT, in consultation with the Department of Defense (DOD), sponsored
   the study to assure the continued safe operation of the U.S.
   transportation system.  All modes of transportation are increasingly
   reliant on GPS and, according to the study, GPS is susceptible to
   various forms of interference.  This study identified transportation
   operations that employ GPS, methods for GPS disruption, possible
   impacts to transportation safety, and approaches to ensure service
   reliability.  Among the reports recommendations:

     * Create awareness among the aviation, maritime and surface user
       communities of the vulnerability of GPS and the need to reduce
       degradation or loss of the GPS signal.
     * Implement systems to monitor, report and locate unintentional
       interference to GPS.
     * Assess the applicability of military GPS anti-jamming technology
       and work with DOD and industry to make appropriate technologies
       available for civilian uses.
     * Identify appropriate backup systems, integrity warning, or
       operational procedures for each safety-critical application.
     * Encourage the development of low-cost systems as backups to GPS.
     * Continue the ongoing GPS modernization program involving higher GPS
       broadcast power and the eventual availability of three civil
       frequencies.

   In addition to the review of backup systems, the findings will
   initially be used by DOTs operating administrations to strengthen
   safety-critical areas that have an impact on aviation, maritime,
   railroads, and intelligent transportation systems.  DOT will work with
   DOD to take appropriate steps to address GPS vulnerability in order to
   assure safe, secure transportation.


   The department will soon announce a public meeting, to be held in early
   October, to solicit views on the study.  An additional public meeting
   will be scheduled by mid-December to present the departments response
   to the studys recommendations.

   The report, Vulnerability Assessment of the Transportation
   Infrastructure Relying on the Global Positioning System, has been made
   available to the public to improve user awareness of the
   vulnerabilities of GPS and avoid over-reliance on GPS in
   safety-critical situations.  It may be obtained through the Coast Guard
   Navigation Center website at http://www.navcen.uscg.gov.
