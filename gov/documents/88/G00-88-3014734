   Overview

   The NIA Intramural Research Program (IRP) has played an important role
   in research on aging which is emerging as one of the major frontiers of
   biomedical and behavioral research. The IRP is a comprehensive,
   multi-disciplinary research institution. The long-term goals of the IRP
   are: 1) to develop and sustain a broad, basic program relevant to
   understanding aging processes and age-associated disabilities; and 2)
   to develop biological, pharmacological, and other interventions to
   prevent or retard age-associated diseases and disabilities including
   Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, frailty, osteoporosis,
   cancer, incontinence, metabolic disturbances, osteoarthritis, and
   hypertension. The IRP conducts the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of
   Aging (BLSA) and is also a setting for post-doctoral training of
   promising investigators (both M.D's and Ph.D.'s) for research careers
   in gerontology and geriatrics.

   More Information

   The NIA Intramural Research Program is comprised of the Gerontology
   Research Center (GRC) in Baltimore, Maryland, the Brain Physiology &
   Metabolism Section (BPMS) located in the NIH Clinical Center, and the
   Laboratory of Epidemiology, Demography, and Biometry (LEDBP) located in
   the Gateway Building in Bethesda. Exclusive of LEDB, the IRP is
   organized into 10 Laboratories and Branches. The Research Resources
   Branch provides specialized resources to IRP investigators; and the
   Laboratory of Clinical Investigation, Longitudinal Studies Section
   (LSS) is responsible for the administration and management of the
   Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.
