   Welcome to the Maricopa County Recorder's Office. We are pleased to
   offer in the year 2001, the latest in technology for your information
   and convenience. Our recording system makes available either in our
   office or on the internet over 30,000,000 images dating back to
   September, 1991. All other records including our first recording on
   June 5, 1871 can be located on microfilm in our downtown office. Images
   of Plat Maps dating from 1901 are also available in our office or on
   the internet. Since August of 1999 we have accepted documents
   electronically as we continue to remain at the forefront of
   e-government.
   We are proud of the many recognitions we have received and that we are
   considered by many to be the premier recording office in the country.
   As in the past 12 years, we will continue to provide the citizens of
   Maricopa County the finest service possible. To ensure that we stay on
   the leading edge in our field we continually make changes and we
   encourage your participation. We welcome your suggestions and comments
   and look forward to hearing from you.
