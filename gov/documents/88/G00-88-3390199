     The Health Economics Resource Center is dedicated to improving the
     quality of health economics research conducted by the U.S.
     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

     It is a national center that assists VA researchers in assessing the
     cost-effectiveness of medical technologies and evaluating the
     efficiency of VA programs and providers.

     HERC offers training and consulting services to VA health economists
     and VA researchers needing health economics expertise. Due to the
     great demand for health economics expertise, HERC economists do not
     ordinarily respond to requests for consulting assistance by becoming
     involved as co-investigators. If you have a specific question,
     please submit a request to HERC.

     HERC maintains a list of VA health economists, including key words
     listing their research interests. To access this database, click
