   NHTSA Publishes List of October 2001 Recalls

   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) today
   released a list of auto safety recalls announced in October 2001 and
   urged consumers to have the problems fixed promptly.

   The list identifies the make and model of the vehicle or equipment
   involved, with a brief description of the safety problem.

   NHTSA said it is publicizing the recalls to alert consumers about
   safety problems and encourages them to take action. Under federal law,
   safety problems must be remedied without cost to consumers. Currently,
   72 percent of the owners of vehicles with safety problems have the
   recall work performed.

   NHTSA said manufacturers are required to mail a recall notice to all
   purchasers, owners and dealers when a safety defect or noncompliance
   with Federal safety standards is found. The agency urges owners to wait
   until they receive notification from the manufacturer before contacting
   their dealers to schedule the repair work. Not all vehicles of a
   particular make and model may be subject to the recall.

   Consumers can get up-to-the-minute information on safety recall
   campaigns, or information on the recall history of a particular make
   and model of car, truck, motorcycle, or child safety seat, by calling
   the agency's toll-free Auto Safety Hotline, 1-888-327-4236, or by
   accessing NHTSA on the Internet at http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov. The
   Hotline also can be used to report safety problems.

   AM General Corporation
   Models: AM General Hummer Years: 1998-2000

   Number Involved: 2,839
   Dates of Manufacture: September 1997 - December 2000
   Defect: On certain sport utility vehicles, the turn signal switch
   plastic cancellation pin can wear prematurely, causing the signals to
   fail to cancel after completing a turn. This could send an incorrect
   lamp signal to following vehicles, increasing the risk of a crash.
   Remedy: Dealers will replace the turn signal switch with a new switch
   having a metal cancellation pin. The manufacturer reported that owner
   notification began Nov. 16, 2001. Owners who do not receive the free
   remedy within a reasonable time should contact AM General at
   1-800-638-8303.

   American Honda Motor Company
   Models: Honda Civic Years: 2001-2002
   Number Involved: 295
   Dates of Manufacture: August - October 2001
   Defect: On certain passenger vehicles, during the assembly process, the
   air cleaner box cover may have been damaged, and a broken plastic piece
   could travel into the intake chamber. If the plastic piece lodges in
   the throttle body, the throttle could stick in a partially open
   position. Although the driver can always stop the car by applying
   additional brake force, or by taking other actions (i.e., shift into
   neutral, turn off the ignition key, etc.), if the car continues to
   maintain speed when the driver is expecting it to slow, a crash could
   occur.
   Remedy: Dealers will inspect the air cleaner box for damage. If damage
   is found, the dealer will locate and remove the broken plastic piece,
   and replace the air cleaner box lid. The manufacturer reported that
   owner notification began Oct. 25, 2001. Owners who do not receive the
   free remedy within a reasonable time should contact Honda at
   1-800-999-1009.

   equipped with tether anchorages and child restraint anchorage systems
   as required by the standard.
   Remedy: Owners will be provided with the necessary child restraint
   system information. The manufacturer has reported that owner
   notification began Oct. 8, 2001. Owners who do not receive the free
   remedy within a reasonable time should contact DaimlerChrysler at
   1-800-853-1403.

   Number Involved: 4,645
   Dates of Manufacture: June 1995 - March 1999
   Defect: Certain passenger vehicles used extensively in track types of
   racing events and subjected to aggressive driving conditions could
   experience cracks at the welds of the rear differential mounting
   bracket. The cracks could eventually lead to metal fatigue and
   dislodging of the differential mounting bracket from the frame of the
   vehicle. Separation of the differential mounting bracket could result
   in loss of vehicle control.
   Remedy: All affected vehicles will have a field repair kit installed.
   Vehicles exhibiting cracks will require an additional weld repair prior
   to installation of the kit. The manufacturer has not yet provided an
   owner notification schedule for this campaign. Owners who do not
   receive the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact

   Number Involved: 7,050
   Dates of Manufacture: June - October 2000
   Defect: Certain passenger vehicles used extensively in track types of
   racing events and subjected to aggressive driving conditions can
   experience cracking of the steering rack mounting brackets. The cracks
   could eventually lead to separation of the steering rack from the frame
   of the vehicle. Separation of the steering rack could result in
   unexpected steering looseness and lag.
   Remedy: All affected vehicles will have a field repair kit installed,
   consisting of lower frame rail reinforcement gussets and a
   reinforcement bracket. The manufacturer has not yet provided an owner
   notification schedule for this campaign. Owners who do not receive the
   free remedy within a reasonable time should contact DaimlerChrysler at

   Models: Ford Mustang     Years: 1994-1997
           Lincoln Town Car Years: 1995-1997
   Number Involved: 911
   Defect: On certain of these passenger vehicles which had their driver's
   air bag modules replaced after April 5, 2000, the replacement driver's
   air bag inflators might have insufficient welds that could prevent
   proper inflation of the air bag. In the event of a crash, the driver's
   air bag may not properly deploy. This could result in less than the
   intended level of occupant protection.
   Remedy: Dealers will inspect and, if necessary, replace the driver's
   air bag module. The manufacturer has reported that owner notification
   began Oct. 5, 2001. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within a
   reasonable time should contact Ford at 1-866-436-7332.

   Number Involved: 78,004
   Dates of Manufacture: January - August 2001
   Defect: On certain sport utility vehicles equipped with 4-wheel drive,
   the calibration of the transfer case control module could cause
   insufficient high-speed gear engagement. If the gear is not engaged,
   the vehicle can roll when the transmission is in "park," and a crash
   could result without warning.
   Remedy: Dealers will update the transfer case control module
   calibration to increase gear engagement. The manufacturer has reported
   that owner notification began Nov. 6, 2001. Owners who do not receive
   the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact Chevrolet at
   1-800-222-1020 or GMC at 1-800-462-8782.

   Number Involved: 6,305
   Defect: On certain motorcycles, the nuts securing the tire valve stems
   to the wheels can fail, resulting in a loss of tire air pressure. If
   this occurs, air pressure will be lost from the wheel/tire, possibly
   resulting in the loss of control.
   Remedy: Dealers will replace the valve nut and washer. The manufacturer
   has reported that owner notification began on Oct. 25, 2001. Owners who
   do not receive the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact

           Blue Bird All American Years: 2001-2002
   Number Involved: 1,500
   Dates of Manufacture: Feb. 14 - Oct. 4, 2001
   Defect: On certain school and transit buses and 2001-2002 commercial
   series and Q-Bus transit buses, insufficient tightening of the
   Arvin-Meritor air brake chamber mounting nuts can allow the nuts to
   loosen over time.
   Remedy: Dealers will inspect the torque values on each brake chamber
   nut and tighten to specifications. The manufacturer has reported that
   owner notification began Nov. 16, 2001. Owners who do not receive the
   free remedy within a reasonable time should contact Blue Bird at

   Models: Blue Bird Conventional Years: 2000-2001
   Number Involved: 158
   Defect: On certain school buses equipped with option 2836-02 driver's
   seat belts, the seat belts are too long, preventing the belt from
   retracting properly and fitting the occupant as designed. In the event
   of a crash, the driver may not be properly restrained, increasing the
   risk of injury.
   Remedy: The belts will be replaced with belts of proper shoulder
   harness length. The manufacturer has reported that owner notification
   began Nov. 15, 2001. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within a
   reasonable time should contact Blue Bird at 1-912-822-2242.

   Number Involved: 13,942
   Dates of Manufacture: October 2000 - September 2001
   Defect: Certain heavy duty trucks could experience a loss of the low
   beam headlights, the high beam headlights, or both. A software problem
   within the Electrical System Controller (ESC) can cause the circuit for
   the low beam or the circuit for the high beam headlights to fuse or
   open, resulting in loss of either the low or high beam headlights or
   possibly even both. A headlight fusing condition could occur without
   warning to the driver and potentially leave the driver in a blackout
   situation while operating the vehicle in the dark.
   Remedy: Dealers will reprogram the ESC. The manufacturer has reported
   that owner notification began Oct. 12, 2001. Owners who do not receive
   the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact International
   at 1-800-448-7825.

   Number Involved: 5,011
   Dates of Manufacture: April - July 2001
   Defect: On certain motor home chassis, the rear axle U-bolts may not be
   tightened correctly due to a random production tooling failure. Low
   U-bolt torque can result in U-bolts coming loose and not properly
   retaining the rear axle to the vehicle, resulting in a loss of vehicle
   control.
   Remedy: Dealers will tighten the rear axle U-bolts. The manufacturer
   has reported that owner notification began Oct. 10, 2001. Owners who do
   not receive the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact

   Ferrari North America
   Models: Oil Filter 111782
   Number Involved: 2,790
   Dates of Manufacture: May 2000 - May 2001
   Defect: Some replacement oil filters (Ferrari Part No. 111782) were
   made in a different manner from the original version. As a result, the
   oil filter may leak engine oil from the seal ring area. In the presence
   of an ignition source, the engine oil could be ignited, causing a
   vehicle fire, possibly resulting in personal injury or death. These oil
   filters can be used on Ferrari model vehicles dating back to the 1960s.
   The model vehicles these filters can be used on are: Dino 206 GT, Dino

           Purolator Pro-Fuel Fuel Filter
           NAPA Fuel Filter
   Number Involved: 45,314
   Dates of Manufacture: June - September 2001
   Defect: The polymer used for the housing in the suspect fuel filters
   may not be compatible with xylene, toulene, MEK, ethanol and other
   chemicals sometimes found in fuel systems. Prolonged exposure to such
   chemicals can result in degradation of the polymer that, in turn,
   weakens the filter housing. The filter housing may leak, possibly
   resulting in a vehicle fire. The fuel filters were shipped by
   ArvinMeritor and are identified by Purolator Part Numbers 804, 805, and
   806, and NAPA Part Nos., 624804, 624805, and 624806 with an

   for a replacement filter. The manufacturer has reported that owner
   notification began Nov. 7, 2001. Owners who do not receive the free
   replacement filter within a reasonable time should contact ArvinMeritor
   LVA Customer Service at 1-800-637-0580.

   Models: Safeline Sit'N'Stroll Model 3240
   Number Involved: 21,759
   Dates of Manufacture: November 1996 - June 1999
   Noncompliance: Certain rear-facing and forward-facing convertible car
   seats fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle
   Safety Standard No. 213, "Child Restraint Systems." The Sit'n'Stroll
   was recommended for use in the rear-facing seating configuration by
   children not weighing more than 25 pounds. However, the child seats
   were not certified as meeting the 25-pound weight requirement of this
   standard.
   Remedy: Safeline Kids will send new labels to registered owners to be
   placed over the existing labels. The new labels will recommend these
   seats for use in the rear-facing configuration by children weighing not
   more than 22 pounds. The manufacturer has reported that owner
   notification began Oct. 18, 2001. Owners who do not receive the free
   remedy within a reasonable time should contact Safeline at
   1-800-829-1625.

   label was omitted from the seat cover. The air bag label warns
   consumers not to place a child restraint in the rear-facing position in
   any vehicle seat with an air bag, since severe injury or death could
   occur.
   Remedy: Safeline Kids will send new seat covers that have the required
   air bag warning label to owners, free of charge. The manufacturer has
   reported that owner notification began Oct. 18, 2001. Owners who do not
