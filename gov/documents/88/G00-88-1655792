                            Go To Court Calendar

   The internet calendar is provided as a courtesy service to participants
   in proceedings in order to enhance their ability to plan and schedule.
   Although every effort is made to assure the accuracy of this service,
   one should always refer to the last written setting information from
   the Clerk's office when preparing for court. Several circumstances
   might cause erroneous information to be displayed. Searches might be
   performed incorrectly, dates entered incorrectly or party name(s)/case
   numbers may selected inaccurately. Always use the most recent hearing
   date and time provided in writing by the Clerk's office to determine
   when a particular matter is set.

   If you feel the information displayed may not be accurate, contact the
   courtroom deputy for the judge presiding over the case. Their telephone
   numbers are:

   Chief Judge David S. Kennedy Courtroom deputy (901)328-3572
   Judge William Houston Brown Courtroom deputy  (901)328-3573
   Judge Jennie D. Latta Courtroom deputy        (901)328-3571
   Judge G. Harvey Boswell Courtroom deputy      (731)421-9314
