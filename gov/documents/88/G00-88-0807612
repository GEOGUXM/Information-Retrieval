   State Programs FAQ's


   Q: What courses does NHI offer?

   A: The NHI offers a total of about 130 courses, covering a broad range
          of subjects within the field of highway transportation.
          Reflecting FHWA's recognition of the importance of training in
          other transportation modes for a successful transportation
          system, we have added courses from other organizations in this
          field to the Transportation Training Resources Catalog (link) so
          that their courses can be more widely presented.



   Q: Who are NHI's courses for?

   A: NHI courses are designed for Federal, State, and local
          transportation officials and industry personnel serving Federal
          State and local transportation agencies.



   Q: Where do I find a schedule of upcoming NHI courses?

   A: Look at this website, under Catalog and Scheduling, for dates and
          locations of upcoming sessions of each course. In the
          Transportation Training Resources Catalog, (link) you can look
          up a course by its title or by its NHI course number. Course
          numbers and names, dates and locations of scheduled
          presentations, and information for contacting local coordinators
          are provided. You may also contact Lynn Cadarr at (703)235-0528
          email: lynn.cadarr@fhwa.dot.gov or the Course Coordinator listed
          for that particular course.



   Q: How do I enroll in an NHI course?

   A: For each NHI course that is scheduled, there is a Local Coordinator
          for the course. Check the Catalog and Schedule section of this
          website for course numbers and names, dates and locations of
          scheduled presentations, and information for contacting the
          Local Coordinators. For additional information on course
          scheduling, contact Lynn Cadarr at (703) 235-0528 email:
          lynn.cadarr@fhwa.dot.gov.


   Q: Whom can I talk to about specific questions regarding course
          objectives, content, or other technical information?


   A: Each NHI course has a representative from the FHWA program office
          responsible for the course. The Transportation Training
          Resources Catalog (link) provides the name of this Technical
          Information contact for each course. You may also contact the
          NHI Course Coordinator who is listed in the Catalog.

   The National Highway Institute Course Catalogue and Schedule lists
          telephone and email information for the appropriate point of
          contact for each course.

   Q: How much do I pay for a course, and where do I pay?

   A: As of January 1, 2000 the National Highway Institute will charge for
          its courses by the seat. Course fees are $75 per person per day,
          but may vary slightly according to what materials are provided
          and other considerations.

   Please see the Transportation Training Resources Catalog [link] to
          determine the cost per participant for the course you're
          interested in.

   Register for a course by calling or e-mailing the Local Coordinator for
          a scheduled session and determining if there are open slots
          available.



   Q: How does a private consultant (or industry representative) sponsor a
          course for its employees?
          A: In the past, presentations for private industry were priced
          differently from presentations for State Highway Agencies.
          However, we recognize that private industry plays an
          increasingly important role supporting State Highway Agencies in
          providing better transportation planning, design, and
          construction, and therefore its participation in NHI courses
          should be no more costly that for their State or local
          counterparts. Accordingly, private organizations may host
          courses in the same manner (and same cost) as State and local
          agencies.
