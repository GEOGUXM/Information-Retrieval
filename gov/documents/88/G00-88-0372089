     __________________________________________________________________

   This is how we will handle information we learn about you from your
   visit to our website. The information we receive depends upon what you
   do when visiting our site.

   If you visit our site to read or download information, such as news,
   policies, or procurement opportunities:

          We collect and store only the following information about you:
          the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for
          example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online
          account, or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton
          University's domain); the date and time you access our site; and
          the Internet address of the website from which you linked
          directly to our site.


          We use the information we collect to measure the number of
          visitors to the different sections of our site, and to help us
          make our site more useful to visitors.

   If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail:

          You also may decide to send us personally-identifying
          information, for example, in an electronic mail message
          containing a suggestion or complaint. We use
          personally-identifying information from consumers in various
          ways to improve our website and the services we provide. If you
          are responding to a procurement opportunity we maintain the
          information you provide, associated with your email address
          and/or company name.  This information is used for purposes
          consistent with the procurement practices set forth in the
          Federal Acquisition Regulations.  We also offer under certain
          contracting programs, the opportunity for vendors to exchange
          information with each other in a fashion similar to a bulletin
          board--this is provided as a service to vendors and is not
          mandatory.  Such information may be used by the government to
          determine the usefulness of the service or for general purposes
          pertaining to the procurement.


          We want to be very clear: We will not obtain
          personally-identifying information about you when you visit our
          site, unless you choose to provide such information to us.
