   Bon Voyage James Tupper

   James Tupper served over seven years on the Pollution Control Hearings
   Board and the Shorelines Hearings Board, and two years as Director of
   the Environmental Hearings Office.  He was honored by eleven of his
   comrades at a luncheon on December 6th at Ramblin' Jacks Restaurant in
   Olympia.  James was toasted and roasted for his unswerving dedication
   to fairness in all the board's proceedings. He was fondly remembered
   for his hearty laughter in the office and his servant's heart.  Ann
   Daley, the former Chair broke away from the Evergreen State College to
   share in the festivities.  Dean Foster, a former representative of the
   State Land Commissioner on the board, Kyle Crews, a board member for
   the Shorelines Hearings Board, who serves in the Tacoma City Attorney's
   Office and O' Dean Williamson, a Shorelines Hearings Board Member were
   also present to wish James well. James's special talent is gourmet
   cooking.  So you may imagine James was delighted when Kaleen
   Cottingham, on behalf of the Environmental Hearings Office presented
   him with a gift certificate to Sur La Table.  As is the custom, the
   board presented James with his own State of Washington plaque, bearing
   the head of our forefather, and embossed with bronze lettering on a
   green metal plate.  James left his position with the Boards to pursue
   the practice of law with the Law Firm of Stoel Rives in Seattle.  Good
   Luck!

   Farewell Dr. Martin R. Kaatz
   The Environmental Hearings Office recently honored Dr. Martin R. Kaatz
   for his many years of dedicated services as a member of the Forest
   Practices Appeals Board.  The group met in a local bistro in Lacey,
   Washington on October 22nd to celebrate his service on the board.
   Members of the board, including former board members Norm Winn and
   Claudia Craig, joined Martin and his wife, Carla, in the reverie.
   Kaleen Cottingham graciously presided over the ceremonies.  Martin
   exemplified the unity within diversity, which has been a hallmark of
   the board.  The board has benefited by Martin's the outdoorsman's
   on-the-ground knowledge of Washington's forests. His knowledge of the
   forests was complimented by his solid academic bearings, especially on
   geographical issues.  The Environmental Hearings Office says thank you
   to Martin for a job well done, and wishes him well in his future
   endeavors.

    EHO Home Page News:
   Please note this information about our new web site.

   On August 27th the Environmental Hearings Office launched its new web
   site.  In addition to a entirely new look, the site includes access to
   the EHO case management system.  From the Case Data page there is web
   access to basic case information regarding the parties, representatives
   and hearings dates.  The case management system is also dynamically
   linked to a calendar updated twice a week with current hearing and
   conference dates.  The new site also includes a keyword search function
   for decisions issued by the EHO boards since 1998.

   Please bear with us as we get the new site up and running.  We have now
   posted many orders issued this summer.  They can be found through the
   Decisions page which has a link to the updated archive for 2001
   decisions.  The decisions page also links to significant recent
   decisions.

   Remaining Bugs. We are still working through some issues on the
   decision database.  All of decisions since 1998 are available on this
   site.  We are working on the indexing function for interlocutory
   decisions that do not close a case file - such as an order denying
   summary judgment.  These decisions can be found through the keyword
   search while we refine the indexing function for the decision pages.

   The 2001 Board Decisions are complete.  2002 Board Decisions are
   current through January 17, 2002.New decisions will be added monthly.
   Shorelines Hearings Board Issues Ruling Invalidating Shoreline Master
   Program Guidelines

   On August 27, 2001 the Shorelines Hearings Board entered a split
   decision invalidating WAC 173-26, the Department of Ecology guidelines
   for developing local shoreline master programs under the Shoreline
   Management Act.  The board held that the department did not have
   authority to implement the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and that the
   implementation plan for formal consultation under the ESA was adopted
   without adequate public notice and opportunity to comment under the
   Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The board additionally held that
   there should have been public notice and opportunity to comment on a
   implementation plan, cost-benefit analysis and small business economic
   impact statement.  The only substantive provision of the guidelines
   deemed invalid was the requirement for conditioned letters of exemption
   covering activities that are exempt from shoreline permitting
   requirements under the act.  The complete text of the final decision
   and two concurring and dissenting opinions can be viewed from the
   following links.
