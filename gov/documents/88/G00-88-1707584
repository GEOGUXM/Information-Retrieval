                                  Site Logs

   Why? In support of GLONASS stations and to improve geophysical
   information available in the site logs
   When? As soon as May 2001, but do not submit new-format logs if you
   have not been instructed to.
   What should I do?
     * IGLOS station operators who have received a request from the IGS to
       submit an up-to-date log for the project should send the form to
       igscb@igscb.jpl.nasa.gov in plain ASCII text.
     * GPS station operators should stand by for further instructions
       after the first set of IGLOS logs are received.

   The format The instructions The supporting ASCII antenna diagrams
   A preliminary example of an existing site log converted to the new
   format. Note that many fields with suggested entries in parentheses on
   the right side of the colon need to be checked.
   Coming soon: Perl code to read, write, and convert logs
