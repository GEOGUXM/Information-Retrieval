   Welcome to Berkeley Lab's ECR Ion Source Group!

     __________________________________________________________________


   Our group is specialized in the production and transport of intense
   heavy-ion beams covering a wide range of beams and intensities for
   acceleration in the 88-Inch Cyclotron. Our ion sources produce record
   intensities for many high charge state heavy-ion beams.


   The 88-Inch Cyclotron is a sector-focused cyclotron fed by two Electron
   Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) high-charge-state ion sources (see figure),
   the LBL ECR and the AECR-U. The two high performance ECR ion sources
   enable the 88-Inch Cyclotron to accelerate beams of ions as light as
   hydrogen and as heavy as uranium.


   The ECR ion sources also allow the efficient use of rare isotopes of
   stable elements, either from natural or enriched sources. A variety of
   metallic ion beams are routinely produced in our low temperature oven
   (up to 600°C) and our high temperature oven (up to 2100°C).
   Furthermore, the ability to produce "cocktails" (mixtures of beams) for
   detector calibrations and applied work adds to the flexibility of the
   88-Inch Cyclotron accelerator.


   Two radioactive ion beam initiatives are under development at the
   88-Inch Cyclotron, BEARS (Berkeley Experiment with Accelerated
   Radioactive Species) and the IRIS project (14O experiment). Much of the
   experimental work is focused on improving the ionization efficiency of
   the ECR ion sources for radioactive isotopes and for rare stable
   isotopes. This includes optimization of the ion beam transport.


   In our effort to continuously improve ion-source performance we are
   currently constructing of a new, superconducting "next-generation" ECR
   ion source (VENUS).
