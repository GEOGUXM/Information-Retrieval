     * notification of intent date (past) of December 14, 2001,
     * proposal due date of February 15, 2002, and
     * restriction of data analysis proposals to analyses of "existing
       NASA space mission data only from research quality databases that
       are open in the public domain" and non-NASA data if the Principal
       Investigator assures the data will be available for the proposed
       investigation.

   SOHO completes roll maneuver

   Under the watchful eyes of NASA and ESA program[me] officials, Flight
   Operations Team members, spacecraft engineers, Science Operations
   Coordinators, and instrument team scientists and operators, SOHO
   successfully completed a 360° roll and 14 hours of observations at 90°
   from the nominal roll position on November 14 and 15. The roll
   observations, performed at 30 degree increments, were driven by
   investigations into the shape of the Sun and the need to calibrate
   instrument detectors.

   The SOHO spacecraft then passed a quiet weekend, completely unaffected
   by its 6th passage through the Leonids meteor cloud.

   The public Yohkoh archive at the SDAC now runs from Yohkoh launch (1991
   September) to within 4 - 5 weeks of the present.

  Complete Yohkoh archive now available

   The Yohkoh science team has announced the public availability of all
   mission data, ending the restriction of public access to data more than
   one year old.

   We have most of the Yohkoh archive online, and soon hope to have an
   interactive access page. In the meantime, see the Yohkoh archive page
   for details.
