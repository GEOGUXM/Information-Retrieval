   Travel Warnings & Consular Information Sheets

      The U.S. State Department website provides many pieces of useful
      information for travellers. Travel Warnings are issued when the State
      Department decides, based on all relevant information, to recommend
      that Americans avoid travel to a certain country. Consular Information
      Sheets are available for every country of the world. Read more about
      what the State Department and other federal websites have to offer.
