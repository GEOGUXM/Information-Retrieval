        The Lab...

   The James J. Howard Marine Sciences Laboratory, located on the New
   Jersey shore at Sandy Hook, is a  state-of-the-art marine research
   facility shared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA) and the State of New Jersey. Federal research at the laboratory
   is conducted by NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).

   The primary mission of the Howard Laboratory is to conduct research in
   ecology, leading to a better understanding of both coastal and
   estuarine organisms and the effects of human activities on nearshore
   marine populations.
