   The BNL Superconducting Magnet Division (SMD) constructs magnets for
   use in particle accelerators such as the Relativistic Heavy Ion
   Collider (RHIC). Electrical current flowing through superconducting
   wires and cables energizes these electromagnets. Superconducting
   magnets produce higher fields and consume less energy than conventional
   electromagnets, which are made with copper cables. However,
   superconducting magnets must be cooled to temperatures near absolute
   zero (about 4.6 K for RHIC) to reach the superconducting state. Also,
   the high magnetic fields produce high forces, which require solid
   restraint of the coil. These two characteristics make the magnets a
   challenge to build.

   The most significant recent accomplishment of the SMD has been the
   construction of nearly 2000 magnets for RHIC. The last RHIC magnet was
   installed in the Collider in the fall of 1998. The largest RHIC magnet
   is a dipole, a cylinder 0.6 m (2 feet) across and nearly 10 m (30 feet)
   long (figure 1).  Nearly 300 dipoles were built by the Northrop-Grumman
   Aerospace Corporation in Bethpage, Long Island, NY. Other magnets were
   built by the Everson Electric Corporation of Bethlehem, PA (figure 2).
   The photo shows a sextupole cold mass. Special-purpose magnets, such as
   the insertion region Quadrupole shown in the photo (figure 3), were
   built at BNL.  In all, nearly 1,000,000 technician-hours were needed to
   build the magnets for RHIC. The magnets used about 21,000,000 meters
   (70,000,000 feet) of superconducting wire.

   The SMD is now building 48 magnets that will allow the collision of
   polarized protons at RHIC. The coils of these special dipoles are wound
   in the shape of a helix. The direction of the magnetic field rotates
   360° over the 2.4 m (7.8 feet) length of the magnet (figure 4). The
   photo shows a section of the magnet, with a cutaway to display the
   helical coil.  The Japanese Institute of Physical and Chemical Research
   (RIKEN) is funding this extension of RHICs capabilities.

   The SMD is also building magnets for use in two accelerators in Europe.
   These magnets take advantage of the magnet designs and construction
   methods developed for RHIC. Twenty-six dipoles are being built for the
   Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN Laboratory in Geneva,
   Switzerland (figure 5).  These magnets were designed so that the
   superconducting coil has the same design as that used for the RHIC
   dipoles built by Northrop-Grumman. Six magnets are being built for the
   HERA Collider at DESY Laboratory in Hamburg, Germany. These multilayer
   magnets use a coil-construction method initially developed for
   construction of the helical magnets for RHIC (figure 6).

   The SMD is investigating magnet designs for possible future
   accelerators. One possible future accelerator is a proton-proton
   collider with higher energy than the LHC at CERN. SMD staff members are
   designing a magnet with a higher magnetic field than that of the LHC.
   The magnet would use a new material and a new design, called Common
   Coil (figure 7).  This design will be tested through the construction
   of a series of 1 m model magnets. This work is part of a national
   effort to develop cost-effective designs for such a machine, which
   would be a Very Large Hadron Collider (VLHC). Another possible
   accelerator would produce and accelerate unstable particles called
   muons. The muons decay to produce an intense beam of neutrinos, which
   would be directed through the earth to experiments in locations far
   from BNL, such as Europe. High-energy electrons, which are also
   produced by muon decays, will bombard magnets for the Neutrino Factory
   and cause unwanted heating of the magnet coil. A magnet design that
   minimizes heating of the coil by positioning it away from the
   horizontal midplane of the magnet is being explored (figure 8).

   Improved superconductor will contribute significantly to the
   performance and cost of magnets for a future collider. The SMD
   participates in the development of the development of improved
   materials in two ways. One way is to work with industry and other
   accelerator laboratories to develop industry-based R&D programs to
   improve older materials such as Nb3Sn. The other way is to purchase
   quantities of the best new material available in kilometer lengths, the
   High Temperature Superconductor BSCCO, from several vendors. These
   purchases are wound into test coils and model magnets to help determine
   their suitability for accelerator magnets (figure 9).

   Underlying the magnet R&D and production effort is a special facility
   that tests short lengths of superconducting tape, wire, and cable. This
   Short Sample Test Facility performs a sophisticated check of the
   performance of superconductor prior to coil winding by powering it in a
   high magnetic field at low temperature (figure 10).  Tests of the
   superconductor produced for RHIC and HERA in Germany have been
   completed. Tests of the superconductor produced for the LHC magnets are
   now underway. The facility also routinely tests the R&D superconductors
   being developed by industry and other labs for use in future
   accelerator magnets.
