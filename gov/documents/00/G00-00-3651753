   Successful collaboratory capabilities remove barriers and provide new
   tools for research - cartoon representation of a collaboratory tool.

      Global warming. Environmental pollutants. Clean and efficient engines.
      The human genome.  Nuclear stockpile stewardship. Far flung teams of
      DOE scientists and their collaborators are discovering the solutions to
      these problems.  Working together at a distance is crucial.

      The DOE National Collaboratories program is creating, developing and
      testing the means for these researchers, and others, to integrate
      unique and expensive U.S. Department of Energy research facilities on
      the internet for remote collaboration, experimentation, simulation, or
      analysis. DOE facilities and their partners will also be able to
      combine resources to address complex questions that no single
      institution can embrace.

      How are the U.S. Department of Energy and its partners creating a
      national collaboratory? What exciting new technologies allow
      researchers and others to work together over large distances? The
      answers to these questions and many more are on this web site. Explore
      and enjoy.

   The U.S. Department of Energy's
   National Collaboratories program is sponsored by the Office of
   Mathematical, Information, and Computational Sciences.
