   Welcome to Mapfinder

   Nautical Chart, Coastal Photography, and ESI Map The NOS MapFinder
   service provides "one stop shopping" for images and data from a number
   of National Ocean Service (NOS) offices. The cornerstone of NOS
   MapFinder is a robust set of products available directly from the Web.
   These products are offered by theme (e.g., coastal aerial photography,
   low resolution nautical charts, coastal survey maps, environmental
   sensitivity index atlases, hydrographic survey outlines, historical
   maps, water level station data, geodetic control points, and estuarine
   bathymetry data). Products are accessed through a spatial inventory
   that locates and describes all data that NOS possesses for each theme.
   This allows for greater flexibility to identify specific products at
   regional, state, and local scales. Finally, accompanying each theme are
   explanatory information and metadata intended to help users better
   understand specific products, their sources, methods, quality, and
   usefulness.

   The spatial search interface offers simple interactive mapping tools
   (e.g., pan and zoom, "find within radius") allowing users to locate
   specific products in any area in the United States and its territories.
   Users can work simultaneously within any combination of themes. NOS
   MapFinder produces a detailed report that identifies available products
   and key descriptive characteristics (e.g., year, catalog number,
   latitude and longitude of centroid, scale), and provides immediate
   access to those products that are available on-line. Users are strongly
   encouraged to go to the Using Mapfinder section of this site before
   proceeding to the Search Maps page.

   Other NOS data and image holdings will be added in the future.
   Information for obtaining hardcopy and higher quality products, can be
   found within the detailed description pages for the product you are
   interested in, or on the Contacts page. Detailed descriptions of each
   theme can be accessed from the Products section of the MapFinder
   service.
