   [USEMAP:ALShpnav.gif]

   The Advanced Light Source (ALS), a division of Berkeley Lab, is a
   national user facility that generates intense light for scientific and
   technological research. As the world's brightest source of ultraviolet
   and soft x-ray beams--and the world's first third-generation
   synchrotron light source in its energy range--the ALS makes previously
   impossible studies possible. The facility welcomes researchers from
   universities, industries, and government laboratories around the world.
   It is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Basic Energy
   Sciences. Still wondering what we do? See About the ALS or sign up for
   a tour.
