   dataslate

   DataSlate is part of the CASDE educational tools that facilitates
   intuitive, graphical search of large image, map, and other visual data
   sets. It allows the quick comparison of data of different types
   covering the same region.

   DataSlate's power derives from a data structure that co-registers data
   of different types. As one moves about a particular dataset, all other
   datasets are kept in spatial synchronization. The user can click from a
   natural color image to an infrared image or to a radar image and
   examine the same region at these different points in the spectrum.
