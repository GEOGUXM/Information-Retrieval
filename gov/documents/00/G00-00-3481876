                              and explanation.

      For many years, scientists of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory have
      conducted annual surveys of benchmarks on Kilauea and Mauna Loa in
      order to track how the volcanoes swell, shrink, or otherwise change
      shape. In collaboration with scientists from Stanford University, we
      recently completed several different types of surveys to track vertical
      and horizontal movements of the past year. The results show a pattern
      of movement similar to that observed by previous surveys.

   Kilauea's summit subsides and south flank spreads

      In the past year, the summit continued to subside at a maximum rate of
      7 cm/yr as magma moved from the summit reservoir to the Pu`u `O`o vent.
      This short-term rate is a little slower than the long-term rate of
      about 10 cm/yr since the eruption began in 1983, but the results are
      not sufficiently different to say that an important change has
      occurred. The south flank moved seaward at a maximum rate of 7 cm/yr,
      about the same as that for the past several years. Details of summit
      subsidence.

   No change at Mauna Loa's summit

      Very little to no deformation was measured at the summit of Mauna Loa
      in the past year. The southeast flank extended by 1-3 cm. Before 1993,
      the summit and upper flanks of the volcano were all moving outward as
      magma moved into the summit reservoir. Between 1993 and 2000, the
      summit area subsided by about 7 cm. The reason for this slow subsidence
      is not clear; nevertheless, the reservoir does not appear to be
      inflating with new magma at this time. Details of long-term deformation
      of Mauna Loa.

                Lava drapery and falls at new Kamoamoa entry

   Lava pours over sea cliff and onto bench at Kamoamoa, Kilauea Volcano,
   Hawai`i
   Lava pours over sea cliff and builds a new bench into the sea at
   Kamoamoa, about 4 km east of the end of the Chain of Craters Road. The
   new ocean entry started on the night of September 28-29.
