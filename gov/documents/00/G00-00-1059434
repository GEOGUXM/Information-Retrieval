   The Isotopes Project compiles, evaluates, and disseminates nuclear
   structure and radioactive decay data for basic and applied research.
   The Project is responsible for evaluating nuclear structure data for 41
   mass chains (~500 nuclides), most of them in the region of A=166-193,
   and provides a leadership role in the evaluation of neutron capture and
   radioactive decay data. These evaluations are incorporated into the
   Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File (ENSDF), and most are also
   published in Nuclear Data Sheets (Academic Press). The group also
   evaluates neutron capture gamma-ray data with the Institute of Isotope
   and Surface Chemistry (Budapest).

   The Isotopes Project has played a seminal role in modernizing the
   nuclear data information system and developing effective data
   dissemination techniques. The Isotopes Project/Lund collaboration has
   developed a Nuclear Science References Search and a computer version of
   a Table of Radioactive Isotopes for the WWW. The latter allows searches
   for decay gamma-ray and alpha-particle emissions.

   The 8th edition of the Table of Isotopes, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., was
   published in 1996, in both hard copy and CD-ROM versions, and updates
   on CD-ROM only were published in 1998 and 1999 . Isotope Explorer
   Version 2.2 (PC Windows 95/98/NT), a WWW-based software for searching,
   extracting, and displaying information from ENSDF and NSR, was released
   in January 1999, and the Internet Isotope Explorer Version 3.0
   (JAVA/HTML) is now available. Additional publications from the Isotopes
   Project are the Table of Radioactive Isotopes, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.,
   published in 1986, and the Table of Superdeformed Nuclear Bands and
   Fission Isomers (in collaboration with McMaster University, Canada), in
   Nuclear Data Sheets 78,1 (1996), on the Table of Isotopes CD-ROMs, and
   on the Internet.

   The Project established an Educational WWW site in 1998, Exploring the
   Isotopes, with a periodic table interface to data on all isotopes for
   each element, and a Glossary of Nuclear Science Terms. In 2000 the
   Nuclear Structure Systematics WWW site was added.
