                       Distributed Systems Department
                   Department Head:   William E. Johnston

     The Distributed Systems Department seeks to allow scientists to
     address complex and large-scale computing and data analysis problems
     beyond what is possible today. The department is developing software
     components which will operate in a distributed environment. The
     software falls roughly into two categories:

     * Middleware providing basic services and capabilities in the nascent
       DOE Science Grid; and
     * Applications and middleware supporting more informal real-time
       collaboration between geographically remote researchers.
