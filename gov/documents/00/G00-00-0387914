                 California Transportation Commission (CTC)

   California Transportation Commission Logo The California Transportation
   Commission (CTC) was established in 1978 by Assembly Bill 402 (Chapter
   1106, Statutes of 1977) out of a growing concern for a single, unified
   California transportation policy. The Commission replaced and assumed
   the responsibilites of four independent bodies: The California Highway
   Commission, the State Transportation Board, the State Aeronautics
   Board, and the California Toll Bridge Authority.

   The California Transportation Commission consists of nine members
   appointed by the Governor, all appointed to staggered four-year terms,
   and two non-voting ex-officio members, one from the State Senate and
   one from the State Assembly.

   The Commission is responsible for the programming and allocating of
   funds for the construction of highway, passenger rail and transit
   improvements throughout California. The Commission, also advises and
   assists the Secretary of Business, Transportation and Housing Agency
   and the Legislature in formulating and evaluating state policies and
   plans for Californias transportation programs. The Commission is also
   an active participant in the initiation and development of State and
   Federal legislation that seeks to secure financial stability for the
   States transportation needs.
