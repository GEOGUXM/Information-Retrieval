   The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, was founded
   by Congress in 1913 to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible,
   and more stable monetary and financial system.

   Today the Federal Reserve's duties fall into four general areas: (1)
   conducting the nation's monetary policy;
   (2) supervising and regulating banking institutions and protecting the
   credit rights of consumers; (3) maintaining the stability of the
   financial system; and (4) providing certain financial services to the
   U.S. government, the public, financial institutions, and foreign
   official institutions.
