   Welcome to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Equal Opportunity
   office (EEO). EEO is a concept that is rooted in the idea of
   creating an environment where each individual can fully participate
   in the activities of an organization to his or her greatest ability
   without facing unnecessary obstacles. Goddard Space Flight Center
   (GSFC) is committed to equal opportunity and appreciation of
   diversity through programs and activities that promote the
   sensitivity and accommodations of all people.
