     The Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Station is responsible for
    ensuring scheduled data flow from NOAA satellites to designated user
      subsystems. It manages, operates, and maintains the station. The
      Station executes spacecraft commands and schedules. It acquires,
       maintains, and distributes a continuous flow of meteorological
    satellite data. The Station develops and maintains records of Station
    performance, analyzes system failures, and establishes failure trends
     and implements corrective action. It prepares and issues reports on
   system anomalies, maintains station configuration control, and ensures
   operator and maintenance crew proficiency. The Station plans, designs,
   and implements system modifications. It tests and evaluates new systems
   and techniques. The Station assists in developing emergency procedures
   to safeguard spacecraft health and safety; and executes emergency plans
    independently in the event of a communications outage with the NESDIS
     Satellite Operations Control Center. It provides support for other
                      activities requiring assistance.
