             External Data Center
      __________________________________________________________________

   The ARM External Data Center (XDC) at BNL identifies sources and acquires
   data, called "external data", to augment the data being generated within the
   program. The external data acquired is usually converted from native format
   to either netCDF or HDF formats. For information on reading these formats see
   Reading netCDF and HDF Files
