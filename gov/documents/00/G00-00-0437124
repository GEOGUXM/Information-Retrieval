   One Plan for Elections Reform Superior
   The first presidential election of the millennium has served a clear
   purpose in American history. Beyond the magnifying glass it placed over
   the countrys elections procedures, the election sent an unmistakable
   message to the American people on the essence of democracy and the
   importance of fighting for it. As we make decisions to better serve the
   voter in 2004 and beyond, we must apply the highest standards but also
   caution.
   There are two high-profile proposals on the table in Congress designed
   to strengthen Americas elections systems. As the chief elections
   officer in the state of Washington, I am carefully monitoring the
   course of these proposals. At least one represents the opportunity for
   a first for the nation, while the effects of the other remain in
   question.
   One bill, proposed by U.S. Reps. Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland) and Bob Ney
   (R-Ohio), requires the federal government to contribute to the cost of
   elections for the first time in its history. I commend Congressand
   particularly members of our Washington delegation who supported the
   proposal -- for taking this positive step forward and for recognizing
   that reform does not come without cost.
   Since 1854, when we elected our first Washington Territorial Delegate
   to Congress, the federal government has never helped shoulder the cost
   of elections. Any hope of reform has traditionally fallen to
   financially-strapped counties--- forced to choose between a new police
   car or improved voting equipment, a better environment or increased
   voter education. Currently, the state of Washington has a $1.2 billion
   hole in its budget. In 2002, those tough choices will only become more
   difficult.
   This means true election reform is unlikely unless the federal
   government steps up to the plate and pays for it. The Ney-Hoyer bill,
   titled The Help America Vote Act of 2001, is a $2.65 billion package
   under which the federal government would pay the bills--- for critical
   tools like new and improved equipment nationwide, a statewide database
   of registered voters and voter education. We are strong believers in
   voter education in the state of Washington. We are one of a few states
   which produces a Voters Pamphlet that allows citizens to roll up their
   sleeves and really size up the candidates. Tools like the Voters
   Pamphlet are protected and encouraged under the proposal by Reps. Ney
   and Hoyer.
   Most important, the Ney-Hoyer proposal leaves control of elections
   where it belongs: with local administrators. You cant succeed in the
   elections industry with a one-size-fits-all approach. The Ney-Hoyer
   bill recognizes that local elections officials know best the needs of
   their counties. For instance, the state of Washington pioneered
   vote-by-mail and the option to vote permanent absentee. This method
   works for the Northwest but may not be as popular elsewhere in America.
   Ney and Hoyer acknowledge the importance of local discretion. Citizens
   have different preferences that work with different lifestyles.
   Last week, the Help America Vote Act of 2001 overwhelmingly passed the
   U.S. House of Representatives. The bill is set for action in the U.S.
   Senate after the first of the year.
   An alternate proposal originally sponsored by U.S. Senator Christopher
   Dodd (D-Maryland) is being negotiated in the United States Senate. I
   have expressed concern with this proposal because I believe it has the
   potential to undo the progress weve made in the state of Washington
   including limiting options for vote by mail, placing unrealistic
   burdens on local elections administrators and creating additional
   requirements on individuals registering to vote.
   Voting by mail has fast become a staple of Washington elections. It
   allows voters to make more informed choices and is extremely popular.
   Last month, 69% of voters who participated in the General Election
   chose to cast their ballots by mail. Any reform proposal considered
   must protect this preferred method of voting.
   Elections procedures in the state of Washington have a strong history.
   After spending 30 years in this business and witnessing elections
   worldwide, in my opinion, our methods in Washington are the best in the
   nation. Our position with this call for change must both protect the
   systems that work in the Northwest and encourage reform that better
   serves the voter.
   The Help America Act of 2001 meets the challenge. My hope is that the
   U.S. Senate will act promptly in the New Year and pass this
   legislation. Our elections procedures must stand up under the
   magnifying glass as the essence of democracy and the most reputable in
   the world.
