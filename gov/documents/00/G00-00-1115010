   Research Areas
      Electromagnetic technologysolutions to metrology problems using
    solid-state quantum effects, low temperatures to reduce thermal noise,
                      and state-of-the-art lithography.
   Magnetic technologyadvanced measurement methods and standards for the
          magnetic data storage and superconductor power industries.
   Materials reliabilitymeasurement methods and standards enhancing the
                    quality and reliability of materials.
   Mathematical and computational sciencesdesign of experiments,
          modeling, analytical methods, and algorithms for science.
   Optoelectronicsmeasurement technology, standards, and traceability for
                         the optoelectronic industry.
   Physical and chemical propertiesmeasurements, standards, data, and
     models for the thermophysical/chemical properties of gases, liquids,
          and solids and for low-temperature refrigeration systems.
   Quantum physicsatomic and chemical physics, precision measurement, and
                          laser and optical physics.
   Radio frequency technologyfundamental microwave quantities, high-speed
       microelectronics, electromagnetic compatibility, antennas, and
                   electromagnetic properties of materials.
   Statistical modeling and analysismodern statistical experimental
       design, statistical modeling, data analysis, and process control
                                 procedures.
   Time and frequencystandards of time and frequency; dissemination of
         timing information using radio broadcasts and the Internet.
