   Open source server project

      The TAGIS open-source server project was initiated to demonstrate the
      utility of using open source tools for developing public internet
      services at very low cost. All of the software used on the site is
      freely available, and is running on surplus hardware. The total
   investment in hardware and software currently is $0.
   1. Interactive Mapping of Mining Data -- uses Mapserver to view and
   query mining permits and abandoned mine lands databases.
   2. Oil & Gas Well Database Search -- an updated version of a popular
   application. Now includes a well location thumbnail map, and on-the-fly
   graphs of production data. The database is updated daily from the
   WVDEP's ERIS production database.
   4. Aerial Photography Interface -- an application providing a simple,
   easy to use interface to the 1-meter digital aerial photography archive
   that is currently being developed by the agency. Not all of the
   photography has been transferred yet due to limited disk space.
   5. Proposed Trend Stations browser (WVDEP Access Only)
   This project was conceived and developed by Mike Shank, TAGIS Unit,
   WVDEP
