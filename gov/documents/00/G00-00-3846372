        The Lighting Systems Research Group researches and develops
        fixtures, controls, and software that employ and promote energy
        efficient lighting. The group is primarily funded by the U.S.
        Department of Energy, although some funding is provided by industry
        for specific projects. The Lighting Research Group is part of the
        Building Technologies Department of the Environmental Energy
        Technologies Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

   Research Projects

        Over the past two years, the Lighting Systems Research Group
        developed the first energy efficient torchiere using compact
        fluorescent lamps and is also designing prototypes for metal halide
        and electrodeless torchieres. Other projects include fiber optic
        lighting, uplights which use electrodeless lamps, and software for
        lighting design.

   Testing and Design Facilities

        When testing and designing energy efficient lighting fixtures power
        and lighting measurement equipment is essential. The Lighting
        Research Group facilities include a goniometer, integrating sphere,
        and spectro-radiometer for measuring light output as well as a power
        analyzer for testing power and power quality of light sources.
