   Randy Kelly is a graduate of Harding High School and the University of
   Minnesota. Today, he lives on Saint Pauls East Side with his wife,
   Kathy, and their two sons, Ryan and Reed, as well as Kathys mother,
   Katherine.

   Randy served in the Minnesota State Senate representing District 67,
   which includes most of Saint Pauls Eastside. In the Legislature, he
   was recognized for his work reforming Minnesotas criminal justice
   system, including creating a statewide criminal gang strikeforce,
   developing a four-year law enforcement degree, authoring many of the
   existing crime victim and witness laws, and requiring sexual offender
   registration and community notification.

   Randy is also widely respected for his efforts to represent the lower-
   and middle-income people of Minnesota by increasing the minimum wage,
   increasing access to home ownership, creating more higher-paying jobs,
   and retaining those that exist. He is proud of his economic development
   work as well.

   In part because of his efforts, the Phalen Corridor has received
   significant state, federal, city, and private investments, and has met
   with considerable success. Polluted lands have been cleaned up,
   businesses opened, jobs created, wetlands restored, blighted properties
   removed, homes built, and a boulevard planted.

   Randy was also key in siting the new Met Transit Bus Garage and the
   soon-to-be-built Bureau of Criminal Apprehension on opposite ends of
   the corridor. Beyond Phalen Corridor, Randy is proud of his role in the
   construction of Metro State University, the Minnesota Humanities
   Commission, the Xcel Energy Center Arena, the Minnesota Science Museum,
   the Minnesota Childrens Museum, and the robotics training facility at
   the Saint Paul Ford Motor Plant.

   Prior to being elected Mayor, Randy served as the Chairman of the
   Senate Transportation Committee, and a member of the Crime Prevention
   Committee, Finance Committee, the Telecommunications, Energy, and
   Utilities Committee, and the Transportation and Public Safety Budget
   Division.

   Randy worked at 3M for ten years and recently worked with his brother
   in a small family-owned business, in addition to serving the
   Legislature.
