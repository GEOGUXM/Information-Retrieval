                  ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HISTORIC PRESERVATION

    Draft Program Comment Regarding Historic Preservation Review Process
            for Projects Involving Historic Natural Gas Pipelines

   AGENCY: Advisory Council on Historic Preservation

   ACTION: Notice of Intent to Issue Program Comments on Historic Natural
   Gas Pipelines

   SUMMARY: The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation proposes a
   Program Comment to streamline the historic preservation review process
   for projects involving historic natural gas pipelines.

   DATES: Submit comments on or before December 10, 2001 [original
   deadline was November 9, 2001]

   ADDRESSES: Address all comments concerning this proposed program
   comment to Don Klima, Director, Office of Planning and Review, Advisory
   Council on Historic Preservation, 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Suite
   809, Washington, D.C. 20004. Fax (202) 606-8672. You may submit
   electronic comments to: dklima@achp.gov.

   FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Don Klima, 202-606-8505.

   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 106 of the National Historic
   Preservation Act requires Federal agencies to consider the effects of
   their undertakings on historic properties and provide the Advisory
   Council on Historic Preservation ("Council") a reasonable opportunity
   to comment with regard to such undertakings. The Council has issued the
   regulations that set forth the process through which Federal agencies
   comply with these duties. Those regulations are codified under 36 CFR
   part 800 ("Section 106 regulations").

   The Council can streamline the regular Section 106 review process
   through program comments. 36 CFR 800.14(e). Instead of going through
   each of the steps detailed in subpart B of the Section 106 regulations,
   an agency can meet its Section 106 responsibilities for a specific
   program by taking into account the Council's program comments and
   following the steps set forth in those comments.

   The Council is now proposing a program comment to help the Federal
   Energy Regulatory Commission ("Commission") meet its Section 106
   responsibilities regarding natural gas pipelines. Specifically, the
   program comment deals with authorizations to construct, operate, and
   abandon natural gas pipelines and related pipeline facilities under
   Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, 5 USC 717f, including the blanket
   authorizations under 18 CFR parts 157 and 284 of the Commission's
   regulations. The Commission's part 157, subpart F blanket authorization
   program applies to specified projects below a set cost level. Projects
   above that cost are processed pursuant to part 157, subpart A. Part 284
   applies to activities conducted pursuant to section 311 of the Natural
   Gas Policy Act.

   Consistent with Section 106, it is the Commission's responsibility to
   take into account the effect that issuing such authorizations has on
   historic properties. Due to the planning process for some pipeline
   projects, such as construction, many historic properties that might be
   affected by the construction can be avoided during right-of-way
   selection or during the construction process itself.

   However, in some pipeline projects, the historic properties simply
   cannot be avoided. Such is the case regarding existing natural gas
   pipelines and related pipeline facilities that are listed, or eligible
   for listing, in the National Register of Historic Places ("historic
   natural gas pipelines"). Natural gas pipelines and related pipeline
   facilities may be historic due to such things as their particular
   design and engineering features, or their association with important
   national or regional historic events and well-known persons.

   It is the Council's belief that the historic significance of historic
   natural gas pipelines is appropriately preserved through recordation of
   their historic attributes. This may include preservation of original
   construction drawings and documents, photographic recordation of
   current conditions, assembly and archiving of historical documentation,
   and retention and curation of artifacts from or associated with the
   historic pipeline.

   Although most historic natural gas pipelines could be treated fairly
   expeditiously during compliance with Section 106, under Commission
   regulations the occurrence of an effect on a historic natural gas
   pipeline as a practical matter disqualifies the pipeline company from
   completing the project under a blanket certificate. 18 CFR part 157,
   subpart F, Appendix II, and 18 CFR part 284. This creates delays since,
   absent the ability to proceed under a blanket certificate, a fuller
   environmental review must be conducted and completed by the Commission,
   which may take substantially more time and resources. The potential for
   delay can impede necessary maintenance, repair and replacement actions
   that are essential to protect public health, ensure pipeline safety and
   provide essential energy resources.

   Absent an effect finding, pipeline companies can proceed under a
   blanket certificate for many types of projects, substantially
   simplifying the approval process, reducing required documentation, and
   expediting the necessary work undertaken by the pipeline company. These
   program comments give certificate holders the ability to stay within
   their blanket certificate, so long as the relevant historic natural gas
   pipeline is appropriately documented.

   For applicants who are unable to proceed under a blanket certificate,
   but who appropriately document the relevant historic natural gas
   pipeline, these program comments provide a more efficient and
   predictable process that also results in an acceptable preservation
   outcome.

   This streamlining initiative is consistent with the Administration's
   National Energy Policy (Report of the National Energy Policy Group, May
   2001), and Executive Order 13212 (May 18, 2001), which requires
   agencies to "expedite their review of permits or take other actions as
   necessary to accelerate the completion of [projects that will increase
   the production, transmission, or conservation of energy], while
   maintaining safety, public health, and environmental protections."

   Once issued, these program comments will remain in effect unless the
   Council determines that the consideration of effects to historic
   natural gas pipelines is not being carried out in a manner consistent
   with these program comments and withdraws the comments. 36 CFR
   800.14(e)(6).

   These program comments will not apply to tribal land without the
   consent of the relevant tribe. The Council believes that these program
   comments have no consequences for historic properties of religious and
   cultural significance, regardless of location, to any Indian tribe or
   Native Hawaiian organization since they are limited to effects on only
   one type of historic property (i.e., historic natural gas pipelines).
   The Council is not aware of any historic natural gas pipelines that are
   of such significance to tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations.

   The Council is seeking comments regarding the proposed program
   comments. Such comments must be received by the deadline set forth
   above in order to be considered by the Council.

   The full text of the proposed program comment is reproduced below.
   __________________________________________________________________

   Program Comment for Historic Natural Gas Pipelines
    I. Introduction
       These program comments provide the Federal Energy Regulatory
       Commission ("Commission") with an alternate way to comply with its
       responsibilities under Section 106 of the National Historic
       Preservation Act ("Section 106"), with regard to effects on natural
       gas pipelines and related pipeline facilities ("pipelines") when
       authorizing projects under Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act by
       either (a) applicants pursuant to 18 CFR part 157, subpart A, or
       (b) certificate holders pursuant to 18 CFR part 157, subpart F and
       18 CFR part 284 of the Commission's regulations ("pipeline
       projects").
   II. Effects on Historic Natural Gas Pipelines
         a. Evaluation
            For pipeline projects affecting pipelines 50 years old or
            older not previously evaluated for eligibility for listing in
            the National Register of Historic Places ("National
            Register"), the applicant/certificate holder will consult with
            the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer ("SHPO")
            to apply the National Register Criteria to the pipeline.
              1. If the applicant/certificate holder and SHPO agree that
                 the pipeline is not eligible for listing in the National
                 Register, then the pipeline will not be treated as a
                 historic property for Section 106 purposes.
              2. If the applicant/certificate holder and SHPO agree that
                 the pipeline is eligible for listing in the National
                 Register, proceed to subparagraph (b), below.
              3. If the applicant/certificate holder and the SHPO cannot
                 agree on the eligibility of the pipeline, these program
                 comments will not be applicable to the pipeline project.
         b. Treatment
              1. For pipelines already listed or determined to be eligible
                 for listing in the National Register and for those
                 determined to be eligible for National Register listing
                 pursuant to subparagraph (a)(2) ("historic pipelines"),
                 the applicant/certificate holder will consult with the
                 appropriate SHPO to determine the appropriate level and
                 type of documentation. In determining what is
                 appropriate, the applicant/certificate holder and the
                 SHPO should consider the likelihood and magnitude of
                 future impacts.
              2. If the applicant/certificate holder and SHPO agree
                 regarding documentation, the applicant/certificate holder
                 will document the historic pipeline, or relevant portion
                 thereof, and contributing features as follows:
                   i. Documentation will be carried out in accordance with
                      the Secretary of the Interior's Guidelines for
                      Architectural and Engineering Documentation to meet,
                      at a minimum, the Documentation Level IV Standard.
                  ii. The documentation will be placed in an appropriate
                      depository as recommended by the SHPO.
                  iii. Once the applicant/certificate holder and the SHPO
                      have agreed regarding this documentation and
                      deposit, the project cannot be found to have an
                      effect (as defined under 36 CFR part 800) upon the
                      characteristics that make the pipeline eligible for
                      National Register listing, and the requirements of
                      Section 106 with regard to the historic pipeline
                      will be deemed to have been met. Documentation and
                      deposit need not be completed for this provision to
                      apply, except to the extent that modification of the
                      historic pipeline would preclude the subsequent
                      completion of the agreed-upon documentation and
                      deposit.
                  iv. For those pipeline projects carried out by an
                      applicant under 18 CFR part 157, subpart A, the
                      applicant will also submit to the Commission the
                      information necessary to comply with 18 CFR
                      380.12(f).
              3. If the applicant/certificate holder and the SHPO cannot
                 agree on the level and type of documentation and/or the
                 depository, then these Program Comments will not be
                 applicable.
   III. Effects on Other Historic Properties
       These Program Comments address only pipeline project effects to
       historic pipelines. These program comments do not apply to
       potential effects to other properties listed in, or eligible for
       inclusion in, the National Register.
   IV. Applicability
       These Program Comments are not applicable on tribal lands, as
       defined under 36 CFR 800.16(x) ("all lands within the exterior
       boundaries of any Indian reservation and all dependent Indian
       communities"), unless the relevant tribe consents. Federal agencies
       other than the Commission may use these program comments for
       pipeline projects that take place on federally administered lands
       under their jurisdiction.
