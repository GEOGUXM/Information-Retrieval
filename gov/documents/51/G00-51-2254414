      Neutron diffraction is a powerful tool for structural studies of
      samples in special sample environments because of the high penetrating
      power of neutrons compared to x-rays. The Intense Pulsed Neutron Source
      (IPNS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) offers its users a variety
      of sample environments for pulsed neutron scattering and diffraction
      experiments. At the present time 80% of all experiments performed at
      the IPNS involve some type of ancillary equipment to control the sample
      environment. These include closed cycle refrigerators, cryostats,
      furnaces, magnets, and pressure cells. There are also devices for
      automatic sample changing, positioning, and orienting. Most instruments
      have, at a minimum, a dedicated closed cycle refrigerator (10K - RT)
      configured for the instrument's particular sample dimensions and
      scattering angles. A standardization in instrument sample well
      dimensions, process control equipment, and control software has made
      multi-instrument use of many of the furnaces and cryostats possible.
      General use, multi-instrument equipment is maintained by the facility's
      technical support staff. Instrument dedicated equipment is maintained
      by the respective instrument scientist with help from the ancillary
      equipment support personnel. The design and upgrading of equipment is
      done by the ancillary equipment engineer with the oversight and input
      of instrument scientists, instrument engineer, and technical staff.
      Ancillary equipment conception and design is science driven, with the
      instrument scientists and often even users providing the initial input
      for design criteria.

      You can view the different types of ancillary equipment available at
      the IPNS categorized by sample environment or by specific neutron
      scattering instrument . An overview of our ancillary equipment support
      facilities and abstracts of recent ancillary equipment publications are
      also available.
