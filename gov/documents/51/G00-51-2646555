   Executive MBA Open House

      The Executive Master of Business Administration program offered at the
      Laboratory through the University of New Mexico Robert O. Anderson
      Schools of Management will stage an open house for Laboratory employees
      Thursday, January 31.

      Kate Livingston, EMBA Program Director, will be at the Laboratory to
      meet with interested employees 8 a.m. - 1:00.m. Thursday, January 31,
      2002, in Side Room "A" at the Otowi Cafeteria.

      This intensive two-year program begins each summer in late June; the
      program is intended for UC exempt employees who are currently
      supervisors or exhibit strong management potential. Candidate
      submission should be based primarily upon the management needs of the
      nominating division. If the Jan. 31 information session is
      inconvenient, interested employees may attend an EMBA open house for
      the general public in Albuquerque. For exact dates and times, call the
      EMBA office at (505) 277-2525.

      The program spans three summers and lasts slightly more than two years.
      All eligible personnel should be given an equal opportunity for
      consideration in compliance with the Laboratory's Affirmative Action
      objectives.

      Interested employees should contact Dixie Paternoster, MS M589, for an
      application package.
