   evidence -- so infect the penalty phase of Payton's trial with
   unfairness that his resulting death sentence violated his due process
   rights?
   Holding: Not yet decided

   Date of Order Taking Case En Banc: October 23, 2001

   Date of Order Vacating Panel Opinion: December 7, 2001
   Issue(s): Could a family of children subjected to severe abuse by their
   father qualify as a particular social group for asylum purposes? Would
   any reasonable factfinder conclude from the evidence in this case that
   the Mexican government was unable or unwilling to control the father's
   abusive behavior? Can domestic violence constitute persecution under
   the immigration laws?

   Issue(s): Did actions by American Coalition of Life Activists,
   including speech, "wanted"-style posters identifying abortion-providing
   physicians and list of physicians on their Internet website violate the
   Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act? Were the actions protected
   political speech under the First Amendment because they could not be
   construed as direct threats of harm to providers who did not stop
   performing abortions?
   Holding: Not yet decided

   United States v. Buckland, 99-30285
   Three-Judge Panel Opinion: 259 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir. 2001)
   Order Taking Case En Banc: 265 F.3d 1085 (9th Cir. 2001)
   Date of Order Taking Case En Banc: September 14, 2001
   Status: Affirmed criminal sentence
   En Banc Opinion: 2002 WL 63718 (9th Cir. Jan. 18, 2002)
   Date of En Banc Opinion: January 18, 2002
   Members of En Banc Court: Mary M. Schroeder, Procter R. Hug, Stephen R.
   Reinhardt, Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain, Stephen S. Trott, Thomas G. Nelson,
   Andrew J. Kleinfeld, A. W. Tashima, Ronald M. Gould, Richard A. Paez,
   Richard C. Tallman.
   Issue(s): Are 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A) and (B) facially
   unconstitutional under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000),
   because they permit the judge to find under the preponderance of the
   evidence standard a fact, the quantity of drugs, that increases the
   maximum penalty to which a defendant is exposed?
   Holding(s): Apprendi does not render 21 U.S.C. § 841(b) facially
   unconstitutional, and Ninth Circuit case law, including United States
   v. Nordby, 225 F.3d 1053 (9th Cir. 2000), is overruled to the extent it
   is inconsistent or holds to the contrary. The panel held that the
   judge's Apprendi error, determining drug quantity which increased the
   maximum sentence to which Buckland was exposed, was harmless.

   Sidney R. Thomas, M.M. McKeown, William A. Fletcher, Raymond C. Fisher,
   Marsha S. Berzon.
   Issue(s): May an alien's earlier conviction for "petit theft with a
   prior" under California Penal Code § 488 qualify as "aggravated felony"
   subjecting a defendant to an enhanced sentence under 8 U.S.C. §
   1101(a)(43) for the alien's illegal reentry into United States after
   deportation and commission of aggravated felony?
   Holding: Not yet decided

   Issue(s): Did two Union Locals of the United Food and Commercial
   Workers violate the National Labor Relations Act by requiring nonmember
   employees to fund the union's organizing activities? Did another Local
   violate the Act by telling new employees that they were required to
   become full members of the Local? Was the National Labor Relations
   Board's remedial order too broad?
   Holding: Not yet decided

   Issue(s): Do numerous sexual assaults of an openly gay employee by male
   co-workers over the course of more than two years of employment
   constitute a hostile work environment and discrimination on the basis
   of sex, after the U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Oncale v. Sundowner
   Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75 (1998)?
   Holding: Not yet decided

   G. Nelson, Susan P. Graber, M. M. McKeown, Kim M. Wardlaw, Richard A.
   Paez, Marsha S. Berzon
   Issue(s): Did the district court err by imposing an armed career
   criminal enhancement based on prior burglary convictions, where the
   district court did not have before it records or statutes necessary for
   a proper evaluation of the prior convictions? May this court limit a
   district court on resentencing to consider only the record which the
   government had developed at the time of sentencing?
   Holding: Not yet decided

   United States v. Orso, 99-50328
   Three-Judge Panel Opinion: 234 F.3d 436 (9th Cir. 2000)
   Order Taking Case En Banc: 248 F.3d 1201 (9th Cir. 2001)
   Date of Order Taking Case En Banc: May 9, 2001
   Status: Affirmed in part and reversed in part a criminal judgment and
   remanded
   En Banc Opinion: 266 F.3d 1030 (9th Cir. 2001)
   Date of En Banc Opinion: September 17, 2001
   Members of En Banc Court: Mary M. Schroeder, Procter R. Hug, Alex
   Kozinski, Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain, Andrew J. Kleinfeld, Michael D.
   Hawkins, M.M. McKeown, Ronald M. Gould, Richard A. Paez, Richard C.
   Tallman, Johnnie B. Rawlinson
   Issue(s): Under what circumstances can a post-Miranda-warning statement
   by a criminal suspect be suppressed because it was tainted by an
   earlier statement elicited from the suspect before the suspect was
   given any Miranda warnings? Do deceptive police tactics employed prior
   to the giving of a Miranda warning, for the purpose of convincing a
   suspect to waive Miranda rights and make incriminating statements,
   require suppression of the statements the suspect makes after waiving
   those rights?
   Holding: Under Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298 (1985), a Mirandized
   confession must be suppressed only if the confession was tainted by
   unwarned statements that were involuntary. Suppression of the warned
   confession is not required if the unwarned statements were elicited by
   improper police tactics. Pope v. Zenon, 69 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 1996) is
   overruled to the extent that it implicitly held otherwise. Postal
   Inspectors' conduct did not render the defendant's unwarned statements
   involuntary and her Mirandized confession therefore should not have
   been suppressed. Defendant was under interrogation while in a car prior
   to receiving Miranda warnings and her pre-warning statements must
   therefore be suppressed.

   United States v. Velarde-Gomez, 99-50602
   Three-Judge Panel Opinion: 224 F.3d 1062 (9th Cir. 2000)
   Order Taking Case En Banc: 250 F.3d 1288 (9th Cir. 2001)
   Date of Order Taking Case En Banc: May 8, 2001
   Status: Reversed a conviction and remanded
   En Banc Opinion: 269 F.3d 1023 (9th Cir. 2001)
   Date of En Banc Opinion: October 23, 2001
   Members of En Banc Court: Mary M. Schroeder, Procter R. Hug, Harry
   Pregerson, Alex Kozinski, Ferdinand F. Fernandez, Andrew J. Kleinfeld,
   Barry G. Silverman, Kim M. Wardlaw, William A. Fletcher, Ronald M.
   Gould, Richard A. Paez
   Issue(s): If a defendant has invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege
   against self-incrimination, may testimony about the defendant's
   post-arrest demeanor and body language be admitted at trial on the
   ground that a defendant's physical reactions and emotional state are
   physical rather than communicative evidence?
   Holding: The district court erred in allowing comment on defendant's
   post-arrest, pre-Miranda silence. Evidence of a lack of physical or
   emotional reaction was tantamount to evidence of silence. Defendant's
   subsequent waiver of Miranda rights did not render admissible comment
   on his pre-waiver silence.

   Andreiu v. Reno, 99-70274
   Three-Judge Panel Opinion: 223 F.3d 1111 (9th Cir. 2000)
   Order Taking Case En Banc: 237 F.3d 1168 (9th Cir. 2000)
   Date of Order Taking Case En Banc: December 27, 2000
   Status: Motion for stay denied. Petitioner's motion for voluntary
   dismissal granted; Petition for review dismissed; Mandate issued
   January 3, 2002
   En Banc Opinion: 253 F.3d 477 (9th Cir. 2001)
   Date of En Banc Opinion: June 18, 2001
   Members of En Banc Court: Mary M. Schroeder, Procter R. Hug, Harry
   Pregerson, Stephen R. Reinhardt, Robert R. Beezer, Ferdinand F.
   Fernandez, Pamela A. Rymer, Michael D. Hawkins, A.W. Tashima, Ronald M.
   Gould, Johnnie B. Rawlinson
   Issue(s): Does the limit on the power of courts to enjoin the removal
   of an alien pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(2) apply to the stay of a
   final removal order pending appellate review? Are the terms 'stay' and
   'enjoin' used synonymously in § 1252, and does the use of the term
   'enjoin' demonstrate that subsection (f)(2) does not apply to a stay of
   removal?
   Holding: The en banc panel held that § 1252(f)(2) does not apply in the
   context of a motion for a stay pending review. The standard to be
   applied pursuant to § 1252(f) is a discretionary stay standard, under
   which a petitioner must show "either (1) a probability of success on
   the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury, or (2) that
   serious legal questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips
   sharply in the petitioner's favor." Petitioner here did not satisfy the
   requirements for a stay.

   Order Taking Case En Banc: 229 F.3d 931 (9th Cir. 2000)
   Date of Order Taking Case En Banc: October 23, 2000
   Status: Argued and Submitted March 22, 2001, 8:30 a.m., San Francisco;
   Submission deferred pending Supreme Court's decision in Saucier v.
   Katz, 121 S.Ct. 480 (2000); Case ordered resubmitted effective Sept.

   Fletcher, William C. Canby, Stephen R. Reinhardt, Ferdinand F.
   Fernandez, Pamela A. Rymer, Thomas G. Nelson, Andrew J. Kleinfeld,
   Ronald M. Gould, Richard A. Paez
   Issue(s): Were defendant police officers who pointed guns at a
   suspect's head not entitled to qualified immunity because the law was
   clearly established that such action violated constitutional rights?
   Was the reasonableness of the officers' conduct a jury question? Are
   the police officers and the County immune under California law?
   Holding: Not yet decided

   Cramer v. Consolidated Freightways, 98-55657 / 98-56041 / 98-56154
   Three-Judge Panel Opinion: 209 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir. 2000)
   Order Taking Case En Banc: 226 F.3d 1099 (9th Cir. 2000)
   Date of Order Taking Case En Banc: September 27, 2000
   Status: Reversed and remanded judgments in three appeals; Mandate
   issued January 25, 2002
   En Banc Opinion: 255 F.3d 683 (9th Cir. 2001)
   Date of En Banc Opinion: June 15, 2001
   Amended En Banc Opinion: 255 F.3d 683 (9th Cir. 2001)
   Date of Amended En Banc Opinion: August 27, 2001
   Members of En Banc Court: Mary M. Schroeder, Harry Pregerson, Stephen
   R. Reinhardt, Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain, A.W. Tashima, Sidney R. Thomas,
   M.M. McKeown, Raymond C. Fisher, Ronald M. Gould, Richard A. Paez,
   Richard C. Tallman
   Issue(s): Did the district court err in dismissing employees'
   eavesdropping and invasion of privacy claims for video surveillance
   devices hidden in employee restrooms? Does § 301 of the Labor
   Management Relations Act ("LMRA") preempt state law claims? Is the
   right to be free from observation negotiable under the collective
   bargaining agreement?
   Holding: In former employees' actions against Consolidated Freightways
   regarding eavesdropping and video surveillance, the en banc panel held
   that state law claims of invasion of privacy and intentional infliction
   of emotional distress were not covered by the collective bargaining
   agreement and thus were not preempted by LMRA § 301. When employer's
   surreptitious surveillance per se violates established state privacy
   laws, employees may bring an action for invasion of privacy.

   Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 98-70782
   Three-Judge Panel Opinion: 208 F.3d 838 (9th Cir. 2000)
   Order Taking Case En Banc: 229 F.3d 860 (9th Cir. 2000)
   Date of Order Taking Case En Banc: September 29, 2000
   Status: Petition granted. Reversed and remanded.
   En Banc Opinion: 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001)
   Date of En Banc Opinion: December 5, 2001
   Members of En Banc Court: Mary M. Schroeder, Harry Pregerson, Stephen
   R. Reinhardt, Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain, Michael D. Hawkins, A. W.
   Tashima, Barry G. Silverman, M.M. McKeown, Kim M. Wardlaw, Richard A.
   Paez, Marsha S. Berzon
   Issue(s): Does this court have jurisdiction to review the Board of
   Immigration Appeals' denial as untimely of an alien's motion to reopen
   his deportation proceedings?
   Holding: The regulation which requires a petitioner to file a motion to
   reopen with the BIA within ninety days of its decision, 8 C.F.R. §
   3.2(c)(2), is a filing deadline subject to equitable tolling, rather
   than a jurisdictional requirement. Socop was entitled to tolling of the
   filing period during the time that he was unaware that his final order
   of deportation had become effective.
