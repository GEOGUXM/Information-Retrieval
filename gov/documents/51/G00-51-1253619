   Understand Road Rage Â— Summary of First-Year Project Activities
   Popular opinion has it that 'road rage' is increasingly prevalent and
   dangerous in the urban driving environment. Whether or not this opinion
   is true, driver frustration in congested conditions may lead to an
   increase in aggressive driving, a less intentionally malignant and more
   common subset of road rage. The potential for significant safety
   benefits might be realized if transportation professionals had a better
   understanding of some roadway factors and characteristics of the
   congested driving environment that induce irritation and perhaps
   contribute to the frequency of aggressive driving. Understanding Road
   Rage documents the major first-year activities of a Texas
   Transportation Institute study.
