    Welcome to NOAA Fisheries Headquarters. (Photo by Capt. Jack Moakley)

   The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) or "NOAA Fisheries" is a
   part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
   NMFS administers NOAA's programs which support the domestic and
   international conservation and management of living marine resources.
   NMFS provides services and products to support domestic and
   international fisheries management operations, fisheries development,
   trade and industry assistance activities, enforcement, protected
   species and habitat conservation operations, and the scientific and
   technical aspects of NOAA's marine fisheries program.

   In 1996, NMFS celebrated its 125th Anniversary. Visit our 125th
   Anniversary Page to find out more about the history of fisheries
   science over the past 125 years and significant events in the agency's
   past.
