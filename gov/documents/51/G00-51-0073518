   Californians make their home amidst some of the most productive
   farmland and diverse open spaces in the world.  The Department of
   Conservation's Division of Land Resource Protection (DLRP) works with
   landowners, local governments, and researchers to conserve these
   resources for everyone's future.

   Our Mission

   DLRP provides information to guide land use planning decisions and
   programs that allow agricultural and open space landowners to
   voluntarily protect their land.

   DLRP program areas

   Grants and Landowner Financial Assistance
   DLRP is California's principal source of financial assistance to
   landowners and local governments for farmland and open space
   protection.   A range of voluntary programs help to meet individual
   needs.
     * property tax incentives for retaining agricultural and open space
       land uses
     * grants for the purchase of agricultural conservation easements
     * conservation project grants to Resource Conservation Districts
       (RCDs)

   Mapping and Research
   DLRP is a consistent, timely, and accurate source of information on the
   status of agricultural land resources in California.  Urban
   development, the types of agricultural land affected by growth, and the
   locations of land protected from development are mapped.
     * farmland conversion reports and GIS data, every two years
     * new programs to map the location of agricultural easements and land
       receiving tax incentives

   Technical Assistance
   DLRP has developed a Land Evaluation and Site Assessment (LESA) Model
   to aid local agencies and individuals in evaluating the agricultural
   characteristics of specific sites, as indicated in the California
   Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) guidelines.

   Contact Us
   DLRP staff work with many agencies and individuals to better understand
   and better serve their needs.  Workshops, guidebooks, and coordinated
   research efforts are some of the the formal components.  For help or
   more specific information, contact us directly and let us know what we
   can do to assist you!
