                  Forecast Research Division - Organization

   [rainbow-bar2.gif]

The Division comprises three branches:

     * Regional Analysis and Prediction Branch
     * Local Analysis and Prediction Branch
     * Meteorological Applications Branch

   The Regional Analysis and Prediction Branch develops and supports the
   Mesoscale Analysis and Prediction System (MAPS), a complete system for
   the frequent assimilation of meteorological observations into a
   numerical prediction model, providing mesoscale analyses and
   high-frequency forecasts over the United States. MAPS has been
   implemented as an operational forecast system under the name of the
   Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) at the Environmental Modeling Center (EMC),
   one of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. The branch
   develops and tests improvements to MAPS and the RUC in the following
   areas:
     * Data assimilation - Improved techniques for estimating
       meteorological parameters on a regular grid, combining information
       from a four-dimensional set of observations with a forecast model.
       Research is conducted on the use of new data sources.
     * Numerical prediction - Design, testing, and implementation of
       improvements to the MAPS/RUC numerical prediction model. A strong
       effort is made to improve representation of processes near the
       surface and in clouds, which exert a strong control on mesoscale
       forecasts.
     * Analysis and model verification - Statistical and subjective
       evaluations are made of MAPS/RUC analysis and forecast products for
       standard atmospheric variables, aviation-impact variables, and
       precipitation.
     * Data sensitivity studies - Using MAPS, studies are conducted to
       determine the impact of different types of observations on
       short-range numerical forecasts.
     * Well-Posed Model - A few scientists are developing a Well-Posed
       Model (WPM), an accurate, multiscale, limited-area forecasting
       model that is not sensitive to errors in the initial, boundary, and
       forcing data.

   The Local Analysis and Prediction Branch performs high resolution
   analyses and forecasts of the weather using both locally and centrally
   available meteorological observations.

   The Local Analysis and Prediction System (LAPS) integrates data from
   virtually every meteorological observation system into a very
   high-resolution gridded framework centered on a forecast office's
   domain of responsibility. Thus, the data from local mesonetworks of
   surface observing systems, Doppler radars, satellites, wind and
   temperature (RASS) profilers (404 and boundary-layer 915 MHz), as well
   as aircraft are incorporated every hour into a three-dimensional grid
   covering a 600-km square.

   LAPS has analysis and prediction components. The prediction component
   is being configured using both the RAMS and MM5 models. Either model,
   after being initialized with LAPS analyses, is run to provide 0-12 hour
   forecasts. LAPS is run in real-time at FSL for a domain centered on the
   Denver, CO Weather Forecast Office, and has been ported to various
   universities such as Univ. of Oklahoma ("OLAPS"), and Univ. of North
   Dakota, as well as National Weather Service Forecast Offices in
   Seattle, Atlanta (Olympics), Lubbock, Monterey, Reno, and Davenport.

   The Meteorological Applications Branch conducts research to increase
   the understanding of synoptic-scale and mesoscale weather systems.
   Scientists develop and improve conceptual and diagnostic models of the
   atmosphere using data from conventional instruments and new
   state-of-the-art sensors. Many research results are applicable to
   operational weather forecasting. Specific research areas under
   investigation are:
     * Developing, testing, and verifying numerical weather model computer
       code and parameterizations for forecasting variables of special
       interest to aviation.
     * Understanding the dynamics and improving the forecasting of heavy
       precipitation during wintertime and the convective season.
     * Understanding the dynamics and improving the forecasting of high
       winds.
