     Brian Crowley's professional activities have been in the areas of
     implementing algorithms in machine vision for the control of movable
     stages in industrial and scientific processes; the design of
     parallel algorithms for sorting, scaling bit maps, image
     compression, pixel clustering, and other basic operations on a
     massively parallel machine; and designing distributed systems using
     Java. His principal research and development interests are in the
     areas of color calibration of scanners and CCD cameras, image
     databases and compression, motion detection, and Java programming.
     Brian also has professional experience in photography and printing.
     He received his B.S. in computer science from San Francisco State
     University. His home page is http://www-itg.lbl.gov/~crowley/.

     Guojun Jin's research and development interests include gigabit
     network-based distributed applications for scientific imaging and
     the use of video for dynamic object analysis and laboratory control;
     acquisition, storage, processing, analysis, editing, and display of
     a variety of scientific image data (MRI, video, etc.); and
     algorithms on concurrent programming (thread, SIMD, and MIMD) for
     speeding up image processing, analysis, and visualization of 3D
     images, as well as for developing high-speed network interface and
     system software. He has contributed to the DPSS and MAGIC projects.
     He received a B.S. in computer technique from Beijing Industrial
     University and an M.S. in computer science from San Francisco State
     University. Guojun's home page is http://www-itg.lbl.gov/~jin/.

     The main focus of Jason Lee's research involves the design and
     implementation of a distributed parallel storage system that uses
     high-speed ATM networks. Other research and development interests
     include gigabit network-based distributed applications for
     scientific imaging and the use of video for dynamic object analysis
     and laboratory control; acquisition, storage, processing, analysis,
     and display of video-based scientific image data; distributed
     computer graphics and image processing systems; and networking in
     all its forms. Jason received an M.S. in computer science from San
     Francisco State University. His home page is
