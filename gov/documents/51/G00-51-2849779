   Templates: USGS ArcIMS HTML Template
   Articles The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has developed an
   ArcIMS web page template for use by all USGS web developers. This
   template, based on the ArcIMS 3.1 HTML Viewer, is designed to provide a
   consistent user interface to USGS interactive maps published on the
   Internet. The template addresses handicap accessibility (American
   Disabilities Act, Section 508) and conforms to USGS Visual Identity
   standards. A configuration utility is included so that the web
   developer can quickly and easily publish a customized interactive map.

   NLCD: National Land Cover Characterization Dataset Published on the
   Geography Network
   News and Announcements The National Land Cover Characterization project
   was created in 1995 to support the original Multi-Resolution Land
   Characterization (MRLC) initiative and fulfill the requirement to
   develop a nationally consistent land cover data set from MRLC data
   called National Land Cover Data 1992 (NLCD 92). This culminated in the
   September 2000 completion of land-cover mapping using a modified
   Anderson level II classification for the conterminous United States. In
   addition to satellite data, scientists used a variety of supporting
   information including topography, census, agricultural statistics, soil
   characteristics, other land cover maps, and wetlands data to determine
   and label the land cover type at 30 meter resolution. Twenty-one
   classes of land cover were mapped, using consistent procedures for the
   entire U.S. and a subsequent accuracy assessment was performed. The
   resulting land cover dataset is being used for a wide variety of
   national and regional applications, including watershed management,
   environmental inventories, transportation modeling, fire risk
   assessment, and land management. More information can be found on the
   NLCD website at http://edc.usgs.gov/programs/lccp/.

   NED: National Elevation Dataset Shaded Relief Published on the
   Geography Network
   News and Announcements The National Elevation Dataset (NED) is a new
   raster product assembled by the U.S. Geological Survey. NED is designed
   to provide National elevation data in a seamless form with a consistent
   datum, elevation unit, and projection. Data corrections were made in
   the NED assembly process to minimize artifacts, perform edge matching,
   and fill sliver areas of missing data. NED has a resolution of one
   arc-second (approximately 30 meters) for the conterminous United
   States, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico and a resolution of two arc-seconds for
   Alaska. NED Shaded Relief is now available as a map service on the
   Geography Network. NED documentation is available at
   http://edcnts12.cr.usgs.gov/ned/default.htm.

   NHD: National Hydrography Dataset Published on the Geography Network
   News and Announcements The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a
   feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the
   stream segments or reaches that comprise the nations surface water
   drainage system. It is based initially on the content of the U.S.
   Geological Survey 1:100,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) hydrography
   data, integrated with reach-related information from the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency Reach File Version 3.0 (RF3). More
   specifically, it contains reach codes for networked features and
   isolated lakes, flow direction, names, stream level, and centerline
   representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined to
   represent waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great
   Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. NHD
   documentation is available at http://nhd.usgs.gov/.

   GNIS Names: Condensed Version of GNIS Names Published on the Geography
   Network
   News and Announcements The Condensed Version of the Geographic Names
   Information System (GNIS), developed by the USGS in cooperation with
   the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, contains information about
   populated places in the United States. The Federally recognized name of
   each populated place described in the data base is identified, and
   references are made to its location by State, county, and geographic
   coordinates. The GNIS is our Nation's official repository of domestic
   geographic names information. More information about GNIS can be
   obtained at their website at http://geonames.usgs.gov/.

   Reference Layers: US State and County Boundaries Now Available on the
   Geography Network
   News and Announcements A set of U.S. state and county boundaries have
   been published for use as vector reference layers. These data layers
   are from different sources and are available at a range of scales
   including 1:100,000, 1:2,000,000, 1:7,500,000, and 1:15,000.000.
