                      Boards, Authorities & Commissions

   The Treasurer's Office plays a central administrative role to numerous
   State Boards, Authorities and Commissions. The Treasurer serves as
   chair or member of these various agencies that organizationally report
   to the State Treasurer's Office. Many of these agencies are authorized
   to issue debt for specific purposes as permitted by law. These agencies
   also may advise California municipalities on debt issuance and oversee
   the State's various investment operations.
