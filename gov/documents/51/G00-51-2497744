   DISCLAIMER

   The Free Library of Philadelphia is pleased to provide free access to
   the Internet for all Free Library users, whether they visit one of our
   55 neighborhood locations or visit us online. In accordance with our
   Electronic Resource Use Policy (#PS90), adopted 6/30/99, the Free
   Library does not screen or filter access to the World Wide Web. Users
   should be advised that there are sites on the World Wide Web that they
   may find objectionable.

   Consistent with acceptable library practices, our Collection
   Development Office now reviews and catalogs recommended web sites by
   subject matter, just as it has always done for books and other
   materials. Recommended sites can be found on our site behind the FLP
   Weblinks button and in our online catalog. Additionally, all of our
   neighborhood locations offer instruction for children and adults on
   safe and productive use of the Internet. Please contact your
   neighborhood library for additional information.
