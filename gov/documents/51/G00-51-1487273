   Welcome to NETL!
   On behalf of all the employees at NETL, welcome to our World Wide Web
   site. For the past 90 years, NETL has been at the forefront of research
   to advance fossil energy exploration, supply, and end-use technologies.
   We are proud of that history and our accomplishments. Now, as the
   newest of DOEs national laboratories, we look forward to significantly
   expanding our role in developing new technologies and approaches that
   will assure the safe, clean, and affordable use of U.S. fossil energy
   resources through the 21st century.

   Our primary mission is to assure that U.S. fossil energy resources can
   meet increasing demand for affordable energy without compromising the
   quality of life for future generations of Americans. Within this
   context, we have historically focused on the development of advanced
   technologies related to coal and natural gas. With the recent addition
   of the National Petroleum Technology Office to our laboratory,
   responsibilities now cover the breadth of fossil energy resourcescoal,
   natural gas, and oil.

   In addition to our work in fossil energy, we have in recent years
   broadened our mission to include support to the development and
   deployment of environmental technologies that lower the cost and reduce
   the risk of cleaning up the Department of Energys weapons complex.

   NETL is a unique entity within DOEboth our mission and approach to
   achieving that mission differ from those of other national
   laboratories. Our laboratory is federally operateda mode of operation
   that is common in other agencies, but not the norm within DOE. More
   important, perhaps, is how we conduct our mission. While we perform
   important research within our laboratories, we also place great
   emphasis on partnering with industrial, academic, and other
   governmental stakeholders to create commercially viable technical
   solutions to energy and environmental problems.

                                     National Energy Technology Laboratory
