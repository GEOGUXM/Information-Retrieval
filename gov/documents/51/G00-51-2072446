                                Human Factors

     The FTA Office of Safety and Security participates in the Department
     of Transportations Human Factors Coordinating Committee. The
     Committees goals are to:

     * effect, in a positive and proactive manner, the development and
       implementation of a national strategic agenda for inter-modal human
       factors research and application in transportation; and
     * to be a significant human factors information resource to the
       transportation community.

     To this end, the FTA Office of Safety and Security has sponsored the
     development of a Fatigue Awareness Seminar. This seminar is offered
     by the Transportation Safety Institute.
