   The FBI Academy is located on the United States Marine Corps Base at
   Quantico, Virginia. The Facility, which opened in the Summer of 1972,
   is situated on 385 wooded acres of land providing the security,
   privacy, and safe environment necessary to carry out the diverse
   training and operations functions for which the FBI is responsible. The
   Drug Enforcement Administration also has their training academy at
   Quantico, Virginia.

   The main training complex has three dormitory buildings, a dining hall,
   library, a classroom building, a Forensic Science Research and Training
   Center, a 1,000-seat Auditorium, a chapel, administrative offices, a
   large gymnasium and outside track, along with a fully equipped garage.
   In addition to the main complex, there is a mock city known as Hogans
   Alley, which consists of facades replicating a typical small town. The
   Hogans Alley facades are primarily used for FBI and DEA New Agent
   Training, while behind the facades are fully functioning classrooms,
   audiovisual facilities, storage areas, and administrative and
   maintenance offices. Just beyond Hogans Alley is a 1.1 mile
   pursuit/defensive driving training track. The extensive firearms
   training provided to all FBI/DEA and other law enforcement officers is
   conducted at the indoor firing range, the eight outdoor firing ranges,
   four skeet ranges, or the 200-yard rifle range.

   The FBI Academy is a secured facility and, as such, is not open to the
   public for tours.
