   (alpha-dominated) fusion plasmas in an advanced toroidal configuration
   is a critical issue that must be addressed to provide the scientific
   foundation for an attractive magnetic fusion reactor. The functional
   fusion plasma objectives for major next physics steps in magnetic
   Attractive MFE 1.0 Reactor fusion research can be described as: (e.g.

   Next Physics Steps in Magnetic Fusion These requirements lead naturally
   to a set of fusion physics Stepping Stones as illustrated in Fig. 1.
   The ranges of plasma performance and duration to address these issues
   are shown schematically with the natural time scales for important
   plasma processes. A design study of a Fusion Ignition Research
   Experiment (FIRE) is underway to investigate near term opportunities
   for advancing the scientific understanding of self-heated fusion
   plasmas in advanced toroidal configurations. The emphasis is on
   understanding the behavior of plasmas dominated by alpha heating (Q >
   5) that are sustained sufficiently long compared to most characteristic
   plasma time scales (~ 30 E, ~ 6 He ,~ skin, where He is the helium ash
   confinement time at 5 E, and skin is the time for the plasma current
   profile to redistribute at fixed total current) to allow the evolution
   of alpha defined profiles. The programmatic mission of FIRE is to
   attain, explore, understand and optimize alpha-dominated plasmas to
   provide knowledge for the design of attractive magnetic fusion energy
   systems. The programmatic strategy is to access the alpha-dominated
   regimes with confidence using the present tokamak data base (e.g.,
   Elmy-H-mode, 0.75 Greenwald density) while maintaining the flexibility
   for accessing and exploring advanced tokamak modes at lower magnetic
   fields and fusion power for longer durations in later stages of the
   experimental program. A major goal is to develop a design concept that
   would meet these physics objectives with a tokamak (load assembly)
   construction cost of ~$300M and a total project cost in the range of
   $1B. The activities have focused on the technical evaluation of a
   compact, high-field, highly- shaped tokamak with the parameters shown
   in Table I. The philosophy of FIRE is to challenge, and extend existing
   physics limits toward the regimes envisioned for a fusion reactor.
   Confinement projections are uncertain, and one of the major objectives

   IPB98(y) experiment is to extend the experimental range beyond existing
   experiments and capability to test projections closer to reactor
   conditions. The plasma performance of FIRE was estimated using a
   zero-dimension analysis with energy confinement given by ITER IPB98(y)
   [1]for the Elmy H-mode, N 2.5, density 0.75 Greenwald density,
   Pthreshold (0.9/Ai)n0.75BR2, 3% Be impurities and alpha ash
   accumulating self consistently with He = 5 E. The results are shown in
   Fig. 2 for two values of density profile peaking. For the baseline FIRE
   parameters (6.44 MA/10T), the alpha heating fraction, f , rises from
   40% at the low end of the present database to 80% at the high end. Note
   that the alpha heating fraction, which is important for physics
   studies, is more robust to confinement uncertainty and rises linearly
   with confinement while Q changes rapidly as ignition is approached.
   These parameters extend the capability to study alpha heating effects
   sustained for > 10 E more than an order of magnitude beyond previous
   experiments. Additional performance (Table II.) could be obtained by
   adding additional power supplies and operating at 7.7 MA(12T) with a
   reduction in toroidal field flattop to 12s thereby providing additional
   physics margin. The H-mode power threshold poses a challenge for high
   field tokamaks and the power transported across the separatrix in FIRE
   marginally exceeds the projected L-H transition threshold. Table II.

   pulse. The primary methods of burn control will be to adjust the input
   power and the D-T fueling rate. A longer term goal of FIRE is to
   explore advanced tokamak regimes using pellet injection and current
   ramps to create reversed shear plasmas (e.g., PEP modes) for durations
   of 1 to 3 current redistribution times. This AT capability is expected
   to produce modestly enhanced confinement and beta as observed in
   present large tokamak experiments, and provides a continuous transition
   from H-mode operation to advanced tokamak operation. A range of
   advanced tokamak modes could then be studied on FIRE. If HH98(y,1) 1.2
   and N 3 can be attained and sustained at 6.5 MA, then
   inductively-driven plasmas with Q >> 10 could be achieved at full field
   for durations of ~ 20 s(~ 1 skin). The cryogenically cooled coil
   systems on FIRE are capable of long pulses at reduced fields: 20 s at
   10 T; 40 s at 8 T and 90 s at 6 T. Therefore, the magnetic field and
   plasma current for the modestly advanced performance case can be
   reduced by 20% resulting in pulses ~ 40 s (~ 3 skin) long that have Q >
   5. Self- consistent physics scenarios and engineering solutions for
   power handling are not yet developed for the longer pulse (~ 40 s)
   scenarios. Wedged TF Coils (16) The baseline magnetic fields and pulse
   Compression Ring lengths can be provided with BeCu /OFHC Double Wall
   toroidal field (TF) coils and OFHC poloidal Vacuum Vessel field (PF)
   coils that are pre-cooled to 77 °K prior to the pulse and allowed to
   warm up to 373 °K at the end of the pulse. The cross- Internal
   Shielding section of FIRE is shown schematically in Figure 4. The key
   "advanced tokamak" Control Coil features are: strong plasma shaping,
   double null poloidal divertors, low TF ripple Passive Stabilizers (~
   0.34% @ outer midplane), internal control W-pin Outer Plate coils and
   space for yet to be determined wall actively cooled stabilization
   capabilities. The 16 TF coil Fig. 4. Cross-section of FIRE system is
   wedged with a compression ring to resist de-wedging at the top and
   bottom of the inner TF leg. Shielding is added between the walls of a
   double wall vacuum vessel to reduce nuclear heating of the coils, limit
   insulation dose and allow hands-on maintenance outside the envelope of
   the TF coils within a few hours after a full power D-T shot. Large (1.3
   m by 0.7 m) midplane ports provide access for remote manipulators and
   diagnostics, while 32 angled ports provide access to the divertor
   regions for utilities and diagnostics. FIRE is being designed
   mechanically to accommodate 3,000 full field, full power pulses and
   30,000 pulses at 2/3 field. The repetition time at full field and full
   pulse length will be < 3 hr, with shorter times at reduced parameters.
   The fusion energy production of 5 TJ (similar to BPX) produces a
   lifetime neutron dose to the TF insulating material at the inboard
   midplane of 1.5 x 1010 Rads which is consistent with the polyimide
   insulation being considered. The power densities on the divertor plates
   are ~5 MWm-2 for detached operation and ~25 MWm-2 for attached
   operation. The divertor plasma-facing components are tungsten "brush"
   targets mounted on copper backing plates, similar to a concept
   developed by the ITER R&D activity. The outer divertor plate is
   water-cooled, while the baffle and inner divertor targets are
   inertially cooled. The first wall is comprised of Be plasma-sprayed
   onto copper tiles which do not need active cooling for pulses < 15 s.
   The large neutron wall loading (3MWm2) at fusion power of 200 MW
   contributes significantly to the first wall and vacuum vessel heating.
   Either a modest reduction in fusion power due to lower H-mode threshold
   assumptions, or improved cooling will be required for a 20 s pulse
   length. The plasma facing materials were chosen to reduce the tritium
   inventory in the first wall. Sixteen cryopumps  closely coupled to the
   divertor chambers, but behind sufficient neutron shielding  provide
   pumping ( 100 Pa m3/s) for D-T and He ash during the pulse. Pellet
   injection scenarios using direct injection inside the magnetic axis and
   guided inside launch will be incorporated, and are expected to provide
   a modest increase in fusion reactivity due to density profile peaking
   while minimizing tritium consumption. The in-device tritium inventory
   will be determined primarily by the cycle time of the divertor
   cryopumps, and can range from < 2 g for regeneration overnight to ~20 g
   for monthly regeneration. The possibility of using only high
   conductivity (OFHC) copper in the TF coil is being investigated. This
   lower strength material would require the addition of TF coil bucking
   on the central solenoid coils near the midplane. Initial results
   suggest that 11.5T could be produced with a flattop of 40 s using about
   1/2 of the electrical power that the baseline BeCu TF coil design
   requires. The limitation on burn time for both BeCu and OFHC designs is
   the power handling capability of plasma facing components and the
   vacuum vessel. A number of important physics issues remaining to be
   addressed during the design phase, and then resolved during the
   experimental program. These include generic issues such as: mitigation
   and avoidance of disruptions and vertical displacement events, H-mode
   power threshold, effects of neoclassical tearing modes, detached
   divertor operation with good confinement, and divertor/edge plasma
   modeling under high power conditions. FIRE, coupled with a non-burning
   steady-state superconducting advanced tokamak in an international
   multi-machine strategy, would address many of the objectives identified
   for Next Physics Steps in Magnetic Fusion (Fig. 1). The FIRE design
   study is a U. S. national activity managed through the Virtual
