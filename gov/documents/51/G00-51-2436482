   Research Interests:

   We have shown that the configuration of the DNA of the bacterium
   Haemophilus influenzae is a crucial parameter affecting spontaneous
   mutation frequency, in that, enhanced DNA supercoiling increased
   mutation and decreased supercoiling depressed it. A cloned gene from
   Bacillus subtilis in Escherichia coli increased supercoiling and
   mutation in that bacterium. This was caused by a B. subtilis spore
   protein that binds to DNA and thereby changes the configuration of the
   DNA. Pure transforming DNA from Haemophilus influenzae was also
   mutagenized by binding to the B. subtilis protein before exposure of
   competent cells. There was mutation only when the cells were selected
   for an antibiotic-resistance marker close to the locus being assayed
   for mutation, on the same molecule of transforming DNA. Lambda phage
   lysogens were induced by the protein made in the cloned gene of E.
   coli, but the protein eliminated ultraviolet induction of lysogens and
   thermal induction of the normally heat-inducible lysogens.
