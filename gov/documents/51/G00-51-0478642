       NOTICE: The Energy Commission intends to issue a Request for
       Qualifications (RFQ) by March 2002. This RFQ will solicit technical
       assistance from a team of specialists for the Energy Commission
       staff to augment their current capacity to process energy facility
       licensing applications and conduct energy studies in support of the
       planning and licensing processes. This RFQ is being issued as a
       result of the temporary, but extremely high workload currently
       being expeienced by the Energy Commission and will cover this peak
       workload over the next 1-3 years. Once the RFQ is issued, bidders
       will have 30 days to submit a bid. Details on the RFQ will be
       posted on this page.
