   The two Sixth Circuit Satellite Libraries in the Northern District of
   Ohio serve the federal judiciary, employees of federal agencies,
   members of the [librarybook.jpg] federal bar and the local legal
   community. Other library users are admitted at the discretion of the
   librarian in each location.

   The circulation policy allows court personnel and attorneys who need to
   take materials to a courtroom during a trial or a hearing to check out
   items from the libraries.  Library materials are not allowed to
   circulate out of the courthouses.

   The following services are available on the public computers located in
   each satellite library:
     * Internet access
     * WordPerfect
     * LEXIS & WESTLAW (With your own password)
     * WebCatÂ®, the online catalog

   The library staff in each location will assist with the use of the
   public computers and provide information about printing charges.  In
   order to keep the computers virus free we do not allow the use of disks
   from outside the libraries.

   Each library provides a photocopier for library users. Please see a
   library staff member for information on the cost of copies.  Each
   library will fax materials to non-court personnel for $1.00 per page.
