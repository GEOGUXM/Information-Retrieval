   1.     Purpose. This chapter establishes policy and procedures and
   assigns responsibility for the National Weather Service Headquarters
   (WSH) Field Office Management and Manpower Utilization Survey (FOMMUS).

   1.1    The program is conducted in coordination with the Weather
   Service regions to:

       a.     review and evaluate field office management practices in
   manpower utilization and related matters for compliance with policies
   and directives of WSH and higher authority;

       b.     discuss suggestions for improvement of these policies and
   practices;

       c.     provide coordinated recommendations to the Director,
   National Weather Service, on revised or alternative policies or
   directives aimed at improving the use and skills of NWS manpower;

       d.     determine the extent to which assigned manpower is adequate
   for accomplishing assigned and actual workloads;

       e. provide an opportunity for field employees and labor
   organization representatives to meet informally with the survey team;

       f.     review special subjects as directed.

   2.     Program Direction and Control. The Manpower Utilization Staff
   (MUS), Office of the Director, NWS, will function as the focal point
   for the FOMMUS program. The Chief, MUS, is responsible for the overall
   direction and management of the program.

       2.1    In carrying out the program, the MUS will:

       a.     arrange for participation by WSH and regional headquarters
   personnel in FOMMUS teams and schedule visits after coordination with
   the regional headquarters;

       b.     provide background information for each facility to be
   visited;

       c.     evaluate trip reports and, where appropriate, recommend
   necessary actions to the Director, National Weather Service; and

       d.     monitor followup actions authorized by the Director, NWS.

   2.2     The regional headquarters will provide MUS with copies of all
   trip reports by regional personnel and other documents relating to
   field office management practices or manpower utilization.

   3.     Policy.

   3.1     The FOMMUS program is a national evaluation process independent
   of existing regional visits. All of the more than 300 NWS field
   activities will be included in the program; however, it is unlikely
   that more than a representative sampling of offices will be visited
   each year. The goal is to build up the survey frequency so that each
   office will be visited about once in 3 years. Regional headquarters
   will give all offices advance notice of visits by FOMMUS
   representatives.

   3.2     Requests from individual offices, employee groups, or employee
   organizations for unscheduled visits to discuss particular problems
   will be reviewed jointly by regional and NWS Headquarters to assess the
   need and establish priority for such visits.

   3.3     Although the members of MUS will participate in making field
   office surveys, the magnitude of the program will require that much of
   the travel to field facilities be done by other WSH or RH officials.
   Normally, they will be Division or Branch Chiefs or their equivalent,
   and personnel specialists.

   3.4     Each person outside of the MUS designated to make a FOMMUS trip
   will work under the direction of the MUS. Each designee will be briefed
   by the MUS on his duties and responsibilities prior to the visits and
   will be given a notebook containing information and directives relevant
   to his FOMMUS assignment.

   3.5     In the interest of effective use of travel funds, and where
   feasible, the designee may carry out other tasks during the visits;
   e.g., technical program evaluation. Normally, however, the primary
   mission will be the FOMMUS program assignment. In some instances when a
   WSH official is planning a trip to field facilities for other purposes,
   the MUS may call upon him to look into selected manpower utilization
   items.

   3.6     In visits to field offices, the designated WSH official will be
   accompanied by one or more regional officials named by the appropriate
   Regional Director. All officials will work together to achieve the
   objectives of the program. In some cases the MUS may request that a
   regional official visit a facility and report back on selected subjects
   without involving a WSH official.

   4.     The FOMMUS Process.

   4.1     Routine survey visits to field offices normally will consist of
   three major parts as described below. Time spent will vary with the
   size of the office and complexity of programs and problems at that
   office. The time spent at each office will usually range from a few
   hours to a few days.

       a.     First, the WSH and regional officials will meet with the
   MIC/HIC/OIC and/or PA/SMT to let him know the purpose of the visit and
   to obtain his views on field management policies and practices.

       b.     The second part involves a review of management and the use
   of resources to meet operational objectives. The review will evaluate
   the total area of management including such items as staffing patterns,
   division of work, efficiency of scheduling, use of overtime, need for
   training, management ability of supervisors, space use, employee
   safety, etc. The survey team should also be alert to problems in such
   areas as labor management, grade structure, performance ratings, etc.,
   and, while the survey team will, when possible, listen to and report on
   employee complaints in these matters, solutions should usually be
   sought through established procedures for grievances and appeals. The
   primary objective of the survey is to evaluate the overall
   effectiveness of the office operation.

       c.     The last part of the visit is a voluntary meeting with the
   employees and/or employee organization representatives. If they wish,
   employees may have private conferences with the survey team. This will
   permit employees to express their views on management policies and
   practices, how they are carried out at the facility, and how they might
   be improved. It also provides an opportunity for the WSH and RH
   officials to explain management's views on these and related matters.

   4.2     Upon completion of the office visit, the WSH official will
   prepare his report, coordinating it with the regional official, and
   brief the MUS. The MUS will evaluate the report and make
   recommendations to the Director, NWS, for action where appropriate. A
   copy will be routed through the Regional Director for comment and
   initial action plans.

   4.3     The Regional Director is responsible for carrying out any
   corrective actions authorized by the Director, NWS. The MUS is
   responsible for monitoring these followup actions.

   5.     Reports.

   5.1     In general, trip reports in connection with the NWS FOMMUS
   program will be made using WS Form A-15. A brief covering memo may be
   used to transmit the report and to summarize the more important
   findings. Additional narrative comments or recommendations on plain
   paper may also be attached to the forms by members of the survey team.

       a.     General Findings, WS Form A-15, will be prepared by the
   survey team for each field office visited. The original will be
   forwarded to MUS and a copy will go to the appropriate RH. (FOMMUS)
   (A-62)

       b.     Highlight in Block 15 of the General Findings Form (A-15)
   special subjects reviewed by the team but not covered in other blocks;
   e.g., discrepancies between office management and existing directives,
   management improvement suggestions, employee complaints, etc.
