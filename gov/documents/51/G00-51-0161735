     The Launch Systems Testbed (LST) at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC)
   performs research, test and development of advanced launch structures.
     The LST defines and predicts structural responses to dynamic launch
    environments and performs design and analyses to improve and optimize
          launch systems. KSC personnel, in concert with government
     organizations, academia, and industry develop new technologies for
                         future space initiatives.
