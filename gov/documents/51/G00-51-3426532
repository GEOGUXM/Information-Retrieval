   "'Stupid' questions are much easier for the teacher to answer than
   'good' questions, so please ask lots of 'stupid' questions. Stupid
   things are always the biggest roadblocks to learning.

   Your thoughts come to a grinding halt over what is really an
   insignificant detail. If you can come up with a 'good' question, you
   probably don't need to take the class.

   The teacher can absolutely positively guarantee that everyone else is
   stuck on the same 'stupid' questions that are bothering you."
