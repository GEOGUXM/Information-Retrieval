    In order to view files in Microsoft Word format (.doc), you must have
      an appropriate application, viewer or plugin. If you already have
           Microsoft Word, you can use it as a helper application.
   If you do not have Word, you can obtain a free viewer or plugin. To do
       so, choose the link below, and follow the instructions the site
         provides for downloading and installation. After successful
   installation your WWW browser will use the plugin or viewer to open any
                               Word document.

                  Microsoft also provides freeware viewers:
             Microsoft Word Viewer 97 for Windows 95 or NT 3.51
                and Microsoft Word Viewer 97 for Windows 3.1
