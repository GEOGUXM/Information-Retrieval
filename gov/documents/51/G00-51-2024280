                                WFF TOPEX AIF
                             Data Products Index

   WFF AIF Data Products are generated from Altimeter Instrument Files
   retrieved daily from the TOPEX Ground System at JPL by a combination of
   FORTRAN and IDL software developed internally at WFF. Custom shell
   scripts merge the data references into the appropriate HTML page. For
   detailed information regarding WFF AIF processing, see WFF TOPEX
   Software Documentation : Volume 3 - AIF Processing.

Today's AIF Data

   This page is one-stop link to today's AIF Data. This page contains
       links to today's aif data for each of the data types listed below.

List and Locations of Altimeter SEUs

   This page contains a list and map of TOPEX altimeter single event
       upsets (SEUs). This page is updated each time a new SEU is
       detected.

Processing Summaries & Events

   This page is an index to the last 7 days of AIF processing summary &
       event reports. These reports detail significant events, altimeter
       status indicators, processing software version numbers, and counts
       of processed, bad, and missing data records.

Calibration Data

   This page is an index to the last 7 days of Calibration Mode Data
       plots. The data displayed are the per-step averaged height and AGC
       data differenced from a reference CAL data set.

Science Data

   This page is an index to the last 7 days of Science Data plots.
       Displayed are various science parameters of interest. Data are
       averages of the records with the "best" mode within a 15 second
       interval. Data are not land-edited since that information is not
       available within the AIF data.

Engineering Data

   This page is an index to the last 7 days of Engineering Data plots.
       Displayed are (1) the "worst" mode of the altimeter and (2) the min
       (gray), max (gray), and mean (black) values of key altimeter
       temperatures and monitors over a five minute interval.

High-Rate Waveform Data

   This page is an index to the last 7 days of High-Rate Waveform Data
       plots. The data displayed are the averaged waveform gates in CAL2
       and STBY modes differenced from a reference waveforms data set.

Low-Rate Waveform Data

   This page is an index to the last 7 days of Low-Rate Waveform Data
       plots. The data displayed are the averaged waveform gates in CAL2
       and STBY modes differenced from a reference waveforms data set.
