Center for Beam Physics

   The Center for Beam Physics assists with immediate programmatic needs
   andas indicated by the Carl Sandburg quotation in the titlealso lays
   foundations for future research. Recent years have witnessed
   significant expansion, in breadth, depth, and scope, of the Center's
   activities. Originally chartered as the Exploratory Studies Group in
   1985, we were organized as a divisional center in AFRD in accordance
   with our mission: to help meet the technical challenges of major
   facilities and initiatives and to generally enhance Berkeley Labs
   capabilities in particle- and photon-beam research.

   In earlier years, our staff had played pivotal roles in the design,
   construction and commissioning of the Advanced Light Source (ALS).
   Building on that base of experience, we were among the primary
   contributors to the genesis, design, construction, and commissioning of
   PEP-II. This energy-asymmetric B-meson factory was built at the
   Stanford Linear Accelerator Center for the study of CP violation and
   thus the advancement of the understanding of matter and energy. With
   this collaboratively built project complete and operational, our
   scientists and engineers have brought this expertise back home to the
   ALS, contributing beam dynamics, rf, and feedback systems to its
   ongoing enhancement and operational improvement.

   Meanwhile, we have spearheaded a collaboration on the preliminary
   design of the Next Linear Collider (NLC), which is now preparing for
   the transition from exploratory R&D to formal design. The NLC is a
   possible successor to the Stanford Linear Collider in high energy
   physics with lepton collisions. The NLC that we are envisioning would
   have a 500 to 1000 GeV center-of-mass collision energy. The Centers
   (and, indeed, AFRDs and LBNLs) responsibilities in this collaboration
   with SLAC include damping rings, the interaction-point collision
   physics, and scenarios and technologies for an eventual upgrade to 1.5
   TeV and beyond.

   The energy upgrade studies are intimately tied to various two-beam
   accelerator studies in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National
   Laboratory, the European physics-research center CERN, and SLAC. A
   two-beam accelerator, a concept we have been exploring for some years
   now together with LLNL, is a possible rf power source for an NLC. A
   high-current, low-energy electron beam passes through structures called
   relativistic klystrons that extract microwave power, which is passed to
   an adjacent low-current, high-energy accelerator.

   Yet another major development has been the emergence of the Muon
   Collider and Neutrino Factory concepts. LBNL has been chosen by the
   national muon collider collaboration to coordinate work on the collider
   ring and also on a muon storage ring for use as a neutrino source; this
   work is predominantly done through the Center. In addition, our
   scientists and engineers are involved in the simulation and
   radio-frequency hardware design for the muon cooling experiment being
   planned at Fermilab.

   We have continued expanding our experimental capabilities. Preparations
   are under way for research into all-optical particle injectors, laser
   acceleration, laser guiding and optical stochastic cooling. Short-pulse
   tabletop lasers have been added to our lOASIS Laboratory (Laser Optics
   and Accelerator Systems Integrated Studies) so that we can embark upon
   various laser-plasma-particle interaction studies involving novel
   acceleration, diagnostics and control techniques. These investigations,
   now in an early exploratory stage, lay the groundwork for a future in
   which the things we now do with rf energy must be done with the shorter
   wavelengths and time structures available by using light.

   We have also continued making progress in our traditional areas:
   accelerator theory; linear and nonlinear beam dynamics; free electron
   lasers, especially for applications in power beaming to satellites;
   radiation sources based on advanced femtosecond techniques; and high
   energy collider physics (including diagnostic and beam cooling for the
   Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider being built at Brookhaven National
   Laboratory ). And our diverse research and educational activities have
   enjoyed enhanced participation by students and international visitors
   and collaborators, old and new, from various institutions around the
   world.

   Scientists and engineers from the Center are involved in supporting
   theoretical and conceptual developments for high energy colliders
   worldwide. Critical and limiting beam dynamics issues such as the
   electron cloud effect, fast-ion instability, etc. have been
   theoretically investigated for the Large Hadron Collider being built at
   CERN, as well as for PEP-II and other machines. Various physics issues
   at high-energy and high-luminosity collision and interaction points at
   colliders have been investigated. And new regimes of acceleration and
   radiation in high energy colliders, e.g., beamstrahlung and GeV/m
   electric field gradients, are being explored.

   Center for Beam Physics chapter of the AFRD Research Highlights booklet
   published in May 2000. Beyond the introductory section, this is a
   fairly technical report. The file is 6.2 MB in size. It focuses on four
   particular highlights of our recent history and ongoing work: PEP-II
   commissioning, NLC and muon-cooling studies in the Beam Electrodynamics
   Group, ultrafast x-ray pulses, and the laser-driven- acceleration
   experiments at the lOASIS Lab.
