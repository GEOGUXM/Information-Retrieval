                                                 RITS

   The GSFC Receiving Inspection and Test System (RITS) is a web-based
   system, maintained by the Logistics Management Division (Code 230),
   employed by acquisition initiators to establish and document Receiving
   Inspection Instructions on a Work Order Authorization (WOA) and compile
   a history of supplier performance based upon the results of receiving
   inspection and test for each acquisition. This system is also used by
   acquisition initiators and procurement personnel to check the
   performance history of a supplier prior to purchasing products. GPG
   4520.2, "Incoming Inspection and Test," is the governing directive
   detailing the requirements for RITS use. To access the current version
   of GPG 4520.2, access the Goddard Directives Management System (GDMS).
