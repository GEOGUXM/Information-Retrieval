     Research Overview
     _______________________________________________________________


   The research philosophy in the laboratory is that we learn by doing.
   Since we are trying to understand cellular function at multiple levels
   and with different sorts of data, we find that we come with scientific
   problems ranging from the pure mathematical to the very wet biological.
   The project area briefly described below are explained more fully on
   each of the area pages accessible from the left toolbar.

   Applied Math: Biological systems are mutiscale, hybrid dynamical
   systems; they have both deterministic and stochastic aspects and they
   contain discrete and continuous processes. They are most often only
   partially observable and controllable. Further, different parts of the
   system have different levels of knowledge and description. These sorts
   of systems are difficult to simulate and statistically analyze.The
   applied mathematical research in the laboratory in keyed to creating
   general mathematical tools and algorithms for the analysis of data and
   models for such systems.

                                [Theory.gif]

   Theory: Theory, in this context, may be thought of as the
   specialization of the applied math research to understanding the
   particular structures that turn up in cell biological and biological
   network modeling. These range from physical chemical theories for
   intracellular transport, to cell mechanical modeling, to stoichiometric
   network analysis. This is where the general engineering design
   principles for cellular regulation are developed.
   Computation: When the system dynamics to be analyzed are too
   complicated it proves necessary to use computer simulation, numerical
   continuation, optimization and estimatation to get results.
   Implementing algorithms from the applied math efforts and following the
   developed theories, programs and tools may be be created for the
   analysis of biological data and static/dynamic analysis of network
   models.

   Data Analysis: This is where the abstract work above begins to be
   applied to real biological systems. The first step in the understanding
   of any system is observation. Measurements of biological systems are
   almost as diverse as life itself. It ranges from microscopically
   quantitative to macroscopically qualitative. It concerns the
   3-dimensional arrangements of atoms in proteins to the 3-dimensional
   arrangements of cells in tissue. There is mutant data, molecular
   profiling data, imaging data, kinetic data and a host of other
   physiological and developmental measurement types. The goal of this
   research is to: 1) create integrated databases for this information to
   serve as a basis for data mining, 2) create functional queries and
   visualization for data linked to pathway information, 3) develop
   statistical data models for each of the biological data sets to aid in
   determining "significant" changes under different conditions, 4) deduce
   and parameterize regulatory networks. It is also in this area that more
   tradition sequence analysis techniques are developed.
   Biosystems: The ultimate goal of much of the above research is to
   understand particular biological system function. We have a number of
   focussing biological problems chosen for their dynamical interest,
   industrial/medical importance, and because they implement an
   engineering functionality (such as switching) that is of general
   interest and may be compared within and across organisms (comparative
   functional genomics?). These system currently include: 1) Bacillus
   subtilis sporulation, germination, secretion and chemotaxis,2) E. coli
   metabolism, pili phase variation, transcriptional regulation, and phage
   infection, 3) Myxococcus xanthus sporulation and chemotaxis, 4)
   Saccharomyces cerivisiae response to pharmaceuticals, 5) G-protein
   coupled signal transduction in cardiomyocytes and B-Cells, and 6)
   Cholesterol metabolism in different mammalian tissues. We partner with
   a number of different experimental laboratories to create the data
   necessary to model these systems in molecular detail.

   Biomolecular Engineering: This effort is aimed at designing and
   implementing custom biochemical and genetic circuitry for pure and
   applied purposes. In one effort, for example, we aim to produce,
   co-opting yeast two-hybrid technology, a reusable, "pluggable",
   flip-flop in Saccharomyces cerivisiae that can remember which of two
   signal was last received. In other effort, we are designing and
   building (through rational and directed evolutionary methods),
   specialized gene expression cassettes that have different responses to
   external signals. The goal of these is both to learn how to program in
   the language of the cell and produce scientifically useful circuits.
   Biosensing: Here we are trying to develop biosensors of two types: one
   capable of measuring protein and small molecule concentrations with
   high sensitivity and in parallel, and the other capable of tracking the
   statistical heterogeneity in cell fate and physiology (especially for
   the sporulating bacilli).
