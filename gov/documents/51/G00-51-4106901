                       Missouri Assessment Consortium
     __________________________________________________________________

   In 1991, coordinators and directors of assessment from a number of
   Missouri's higher education institutions came together and formed the
   Missouri Assessment Consortium (MAC) for the purpose of exchanging
   ideas among themselves and with members of the CBHE staff. In 1992, the
   MAC issued a statement listing eight Principles for Assessment in
   Missouri's Public Institutions of Higher Education. These principles
   emphasized the need to develop assessment programs that would lead to
   increased student learning and improved programs, and which also would
   assure the public that their moneys are being spent wisely. This MAC
   web page will try to keep you posted and up to date on the purposes,
   goals, and progress of Assessment issues for Missouri's Public &
   Private two- and four-year institutions of higher education. The
   Missouri Assessment Handbook, a set of chapters that outline and
   summarize the principals and philosophies for good assessment as agreed
   upon by the active members of the Missouri Assessment Consortium, is
   presented in this web page. The table of contents below gives the
   topics covered in this handbook.
