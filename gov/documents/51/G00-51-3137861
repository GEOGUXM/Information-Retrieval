   Space Data Systems (NIS-3)

      Stephen G. Blair
      Group Leader

      Group NIS-3 activities include developing real-time data acquisition
      and control systems, building and operating satellite ground stations,
      scientific and database programming, and maintaining multi-user open
      and secure distributed computing environments. These efforts date from
      the Vela series of spacecraft in the early 1960s through a number of
      current DOE, DoD, and NASA missions. NIS-3 emphasizes consistent
      handling of data during the various phases of each experimentÕs
      lifecycle and focuses on use of standards and commercial products,
      reuse of software, and development of CPU-independent systems.
