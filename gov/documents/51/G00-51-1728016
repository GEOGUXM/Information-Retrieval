   GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT WORKING GROUPS

   When President Clinton signed the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
   on November 12, 1999, the regulation of and relationships within the
   financial services industry was changed forever.

   In recognition that the new federal law will bring sweeping and
   significant legal, financial, regulatory and policy shifts with
   tremendous impact upon California insurance consumers, the Commissioner
   convened a CDI Working Group on the GLBA.

   The Commissioner holds high expectations for the delivery of sound
   legal, financial, enforcement, regulatory, intergovernmental and
   consumer protection recommendations from this Working Group.

   Thank you for your interest in the leadership and action by the CDI
   Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Working Group.
