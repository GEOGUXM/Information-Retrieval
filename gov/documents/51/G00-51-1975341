   The MSFC X-ray Astronomy Group has grown over the years to encompass a
   wide variety of research investigations. The table below provides an
   indication of this diversity and shows how we have organized our web
   pages. Basically, the organization follows the activities of the group
   from the general (experimental astrophysics, space missions, and
   theoretical & observational astrophysics) to the specific (such as
   analysis of CXO observations of the Crab Nebula). Underlined entries in
   the below table have active links. Others will be added in the future.

   Most web pages below this one will contain the blue table shown at the
   left side of this page to allow the reader to easily navigate between
   topics.

   So choose a topic and learn more about x-ray astronomy at MSFC.
