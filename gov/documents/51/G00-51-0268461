                                LIFE ON MARS?
     __________________________________________________________________




      Do Martians Exist?

      If "Martians" ever existed, they wouldn't be the "little green men" of
      our imagination. Water probably didn't exist on the surface of Mars
      long enough for anything other than very small, bacteria-like life
      forms to develop.

      microbes?

      Even the prospect of finding the tiniest life forms, however, is
      extremely exciting. To our knowledge, life has only developed on one
      planet: Earth. Finding life on Mars, however small it might be, would
      radically change the way we think about the possibilities for life
      throughout the Universe.

      Finding Signs of Life on Mars

      Finding life isn't exactly easy--scientists aren't even satisfied yet
      that they have a definition for life that would work for any planet.
      It's a little easier to define what it means on Earth, but have we
      fully considered what alien life might be like? What if we were only
      looking for Earth-like life, and missed the other kinds of life that
      might be possible?

      Questions like these are being asked by astrobiologists, the scientists
      who study life and its possibilities throughout the Universe.

      Identifying Life Wherever it Exists
      Find out how astrobiologists are thinking about non-Earth-centric
      definitions of life. Learn about the strange world of microbes on our
      own planet--it might seem alien, but it exists all around us. See if
      you can pick out the life forms in scientific images too.
