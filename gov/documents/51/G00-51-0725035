   Introduction
   This collection of resources and information on Space Science Data
   Mining is not intended to be comprehensive, since whole books and
   numerous international conferences each year address this subject
   matter. The material presented here is primarily intended to be a
   representative subset of those items that we have found useful or
   applicable to data mining within the space sciences. In particular, the
   summarization of the "Mining the Sky" conference focuses on those
   aspects.
   Disclaimer: Many web sites are referenced in this report. There is no
   endorsement suggested or implied for any product identified here. The

   What is Data Mining? What is Knowledge Discovery?
   Definition: "Data mining is defined as an information extraction
   activity whose goal is to discover hidden facts contained in
   databases."
   Definition: "Knowledge discovery refers to finding out new knowledge
   about an application domain using data on the domain usually stored in
   a database."
   (The application domain may be astrophysics, earth science, solar sytem
   science, credit card usage histories, telephone usage histories,
   basketball play-by-play histories, etc...)
   Data Mining Summaries:
     * Data mining glossary
     * Lecture notes on data mining
     * Data Mining 101
     * Data mining research: opportunities and challenges
     * Kurt Thearling's extensive Data Mining Tutorial
     * Kurt Thearling's extensive list of Data Mining White Papers
     * J. H. Maindonald's detailed report on issues and approaches related
       to Scientific Data Mining

   Data mining is used to find patterns and relationships in data.
   Patterns can be analyzed via 2 types of models:
     * Descriptive Models: Used to describe patterns and to create
       meaningful subgroups or clusters.
     * Predictive Models: Used to forecast explicit values, based upon
       patterns in known results.

   How does this apply to scientific research? ... through KNOWLEDGE
   DISCOVERY.
   Analysis of Data leads to Information, which leads to Knowledge, which
   ultimately leads to Understanding, which is what we really seek when we
   perform data mining. Understanding leads to new questions, which leads
   to collecting more data, and so on, in a continuing cycle. This is the
   essense of the Scientific Method.
   In large scientific databases, data mining and knowledge discovery come
   in two flavors:
     * Event-based mining: (based upon events or trends in data)
          + Known events / known algorithms -- use existing physical
            models (descriptive models; algorithms) to locate known
            phenomena of interest either spatially or temporally within a
            large database.
          + Known events / unknown algorithms -- use pattern recognition
            and clustering properties of data to discover new
            observational (physical) relationships (algorithms) among
            known phenomena.
          + Unknown events / known algorithms -- use expected physical
            relationships (predictive models; algorithms) among
            observational parameters of physical phenomena to predict the
            presence of previously unseen events within a large complex
            database.
          + Unknown events / unknown algorithms -- use thresholds or
            trends to identify transient or otherwise unique
            ("one-of-a-kind") events and therefore to discover new
            physical phenomena.
     * Relationship-based mining: (based upon associations and
       relationships within data)
          + Spatial associations -- identify events (e.g., astronomical
            objects) at the same location (e.g., same region of the sky).
          + Temporal associations -- identify events occurring during the
            same or related periods of time.
          + Coincidence associations -- use clustering techniques to
            identify events that are co-located within a multi-dimensional
            parameter space.

   User Requirements for Data Mining in Large Scientific Databases
     * Cross-Identification -- refers to the classical problem of
       associating the source list in one database to the source list in
       another.
     * Cross-Correlation -- refers to the search for correlations,
       tendencies, and trends between physical parameters in
       multi-dimensional data, usually across databases.
     * Nearest-Neighbor Identification -- refers to the general
       application of clustering algorithms in multi-dimensional parameter
       space, usually within a database.
     * Systematic Data Exploration -- refers to the application of the
       broad range of event-based and relationship-based "What if?"
       queries to a database in the hope of making a serendipitous
       discovery of new objects or a new class of objects.

   XML for distributed data mining
   XML (= eXtensible Markup Language) has been found to be an increasingly
   useful and universally supported metadata interchange language. Several
   groups have investigated uses of XML that have scientific data mining
   applications:
     * NASA's Astronomical Data Center (ADC) XML Resources Page
     * Extensible Data Format (XDF) = a common scientific data format
       based on general mathematical principles, object models, and XML
       that can be used throughout the scientific disciplines.
     * Extensible Scientific Interchange Language (XSIL)
     * Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML)
     * Project DataSpace (includes PMML and DXML)

   Data Mining with the NVO and The GRID
   Why "Data Mining with the NVO" (= National Virtual Observatory)? (1)
   Because the major functions of the NVO and the related technical issues
   include many aspects of data mining. And (2) the NVO is a framework to
   enable distributed data mining across multiple heterogeneous data &
   information services. The goals of the NVO include the following:
     * To facilitate data mining and knowledge discovery within the new,
       existing, and upcoming very large astronomical databases
       (tera-bases). Related technical issues include: indexing for fast
       queries, filtering of large queries, data subsetting,
       visualization, statistical analysis, parallelism (queries &
       access), . . .
     * To facilitate linkages and cross-archive investigations utilizing
       new mission data in conjunction with the rich legacy data archives
       that preceded them. Related technical issues include: distributed
       computing, scalable architectures, load balancing, thin middleware
       layer, interoperability, code libraries, code-shipping,
       data-finding services, data standards & interchange formats,
       query/results protocols, data fusion, quality assessment,
       archive/metadata profiles, user profiles, intelligent agents, . . .

   Some papers that address the issues and applications of Data Mining
   with a Virtual Observatory include these:
     * "Toward a National Virtual Observatory: Science Goals, Technical
       Challanges, and Implementation Plan", by the NVO Interim Steering
       Committee.

       al.
     * "Searches for Rare and New Types of Objects", by S.G.Djorgovski et
       al.

   The NVO was the number 1 small initiative recommended in the 2000-2010
   Decadal Survey Report prepared by the Astronomy and Astrophysics Survey
   Committee (AASC), convened by The National Research Council of the
   National Academy Sciences. References to the NVO can be found in the
   AASC's report "Astronomy and Astrophysics in the New Millennium" on the
   following pages -- Page 10 -- Page 12 -- Page 14 -- Page 33 -- Page 34
   -- Page 37 -- Page 39 -- Page 44 -- Pages 132-133.
   The NVO Interim Steering Committee has prepared an NVO White Paper.

   What is The GRID?
   "The GRID is a distributed computing infrastructure that facilitates
   resource-sharing and coordinated problem-solving in dynamic,
   multi-institutional virtual organizations." Thus, the GRID is a
   prototype or model for the NVO.

Title:  Science User Scenarios for a Virtual Observatory Design
        Reference Mission: Science Requirements for Data Mining
Comments: 4 pages. Paper to appear in the proceedings of the June 2000
  "Virtual Observatories of the Future" conference at Caltech, edited
  by R. J. Brunner, S. G. Djorgovski, & A. Szalay.

ABSTRACT:  The knowledge discovery potential of the new large
astronomical databases is vast. When these are used in conjunction with
the rich legacy data archives, the opportunities for scientific
discovery multiply rapidly. A Virtual Observatory (VO) framework will
enable transparent and efficient access, search, retrieval, and
visualization of data across multiple data repositories, which are
generally heterogeneous and distributed. Aspects of data mining that
apply to a variety of science user scenarios with a VO are reviewed.
The development of a VO should address the data mining needs of various
astronomical research constituencies. By way of example, two user
scenarios are presented which invoke applications and linkages of data
across the catalog and image domains in order to address specific
astrophysics research problems.  These illustrate a subset of the
desired capabilities and power of the VO, and as such they represent
potential components of a VO Design Reference Mission.

   Parallel and High-Speed Data Mining
     * The concept of parallel data mining is a particularly interesting
       and relevant topic for mining very large scientific databases. The
       use of inexpensive Beowulf clusters of PC's for parallel
       drill-downs into huge databases may represent one implementation of
       an NVO data mining and search engine. Some examples of groups
       pursuing such research include these:

   "MINING THE SKY" Conference Report
   [Disclaimer: This report was prepared by K.Borne and reflects the
   interests and note-taking abilities of the preparer. The preparer
   regrets any misrepresentation or incomplete representations of the
   conference papers. For more details and more complete information
   regarding any paper described here, and for many other papers not
   described here, please refer to the on-line conference proceedings.]
   INTRODUCTION:
   The conference web site is here :
   http://www.MPA-Garching.MPG.DE/~cosmo/
   The conference organizers have compiled their own list of data mining
   links.
   Similarly, there was a conference on "Virtual Observatories of the
   Future" (VOF) at Caltech in June, 2000. The VOF conference web site is:
   http://www.astro.caltech.edu/nvoconf/, with a subset of the conference
   presentations available on-line.
   One of the major topics of discussion at the MINING THE SKY conference
   was the European Virtual Observatory effort. It is coordinated by the
   OPTICON network. Their first step towards implementing a VO is their
   ASTROVIRTEL project. A fuller discussion of the OPTICON network can be
   found in these papers by Gerry Gilmore: "OPTICON and the Virtual
   Observatory" and "OPTICON: EC Optical Infrared Coordination Network for
   Astronomy".
   A project related to the NVO was discussed at these conferences: The
   Digital Sky Project. This project was described in a paper here:
   http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0011222
   A significant Virtual Observatory initiative in the UK is now underway:
   The Astro-Grid Project. They sponsored their First Astro-Grid Workshop
   in January 2001.
   REPORTS ON INDIVIDUAL PAPERS:
   Specific highlights will now be presented from a few of the talks at
   the MINING THE SKY conference that were particularly useful and
   relevant for space science data mining. In most cases, the papers are
   available at the on-line conference proceedings web site.
    1. Three of the better summary talks on data mining space science data
       were:
          + "Mining 101" by E.Wright
          + "Massive Variability Searches" by B.Paczynski, which was
            published under a different title.
            [may require subscription to be accessed]
          + "Exploration of Large Digital Sky Surveys", by S.G.Djorgovski
    2. B.Paczynski provided some links to very large databases of millions
       of astronomical observations:
          + http://archive.Princeton.EDU/~asas/
          + http://bulge.princeton.edu/~ogle/
       The ASAS (All Sky Automated Survey) is described in a paper here:
       http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0005236
    3. Though not on-line, P.Quinn's talk on the MACHO dataset was also
       very informative. Their survey accumulated 90,000 images of the
       sky, which comprise nearly 6 terabytes. Their derived photometric
       database ("variable star catalog") is several hundred gigabytes
       alone!
    4. Several speakers reviewed indexing schemes for very large
       astronomical databases, primarily in the context of all-sky maps
       (e.g., cosmic microwave background experiments, such as COBE or
       MAP). Two of the most discussed indexing schemes were HTM
       (Hierarchical Triangular Mesh) and HEALPIX. Some related papers
       were:
          + "The Hierarchical Triangular Mesh" by P. Kunszt. See also the
            related paper: "The Indexing of the SDSS Science Archive".
          + "Splitting the Sky: HTM and HEALPix" by W. O'Mullane.
          + Additional information on these techniques can be found here:
            HTM : http://www.sdss.jhu.edu/htm/
            HEALPix : http://www.eso.org/science/healpix/
          + The paper by R.van de Weygaert on "Tesselation Reconstruction
            Techniques" showed promising application to both mining of
            datasets that map either to the earth sphere or to the
            celestial sphere.
          + A discussion of KD-trees and other techniques for indexing and
            searching through large databases was presented by I.Szapudi
            in his talk "Estimation of Correlations in Large Samples". He
            described how a search can be reduced from N^3 to Nlog(N).
    5. O.Lahav introduced the "Information Bottleneck Method" for the
       compression and classification. He particularly talked about an
       astronomical application, but it also works for document
       classification and other applications. In addition to the on-line
       conference presentation, related papers can be found here:
          + http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0005306
          + http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9911102
    6. A technically informative paper on a powerful distributed parallel
       computing architecture for mining very large terabyte databases
       (for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey) was presented by A.Thakar.
    7. Statistician Andrew Moore (CMU) gave an excellent summary of
       problems related to autonomous data mining, KD-trees, AD-trees,
       R-trees, ball trees, etc. Some links to his work can be found here:
          + http://www.autonlab.org/
          + http://www.autonlab.org/datamine.html
          + http://www.schenley.com/
    8. Several speakers spoke on automated techniques, including
       J.Hakkila, N.Christlieb, G.Djorgovski, D.Madgwick, and others. For
       example, J.Hakkila (AISRP grant-holder) gave a talk on mining
       gamma-ray burst data. In addition to his on-line talk, there are
       several related papers available on unsupervised learning,
       artificial intelligence, a data mining tool shed, etc. The data
       mining "tool shed" link is here: http://grb.CS.MNSU.EDU/~grb/
    9. Though not specifically on the subject of data mining, many of the
       early talks at the conference described large astronomical surveys
       that are underway or being planned. These will produce very large
       datasets that will be prime targets for data mining.
   10. There were talks on PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and
       Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, particularly the talk by
       N.Christlieb.
   11. There were talks on neural nets, including E.Bertin, G.Longo, and
       R.Tagliaferri. Most of these speakers also discussed SOMs
       (Self-Organized Maps) and wavelets as means to compress and
       classify large data sets. A useful link was provided by Bertin:
       http://www.multiresolution.com/
   12. The numerical simulation theorists have generated their own
       numerical (Virtual) observatory where one can explore gigabyte data
       sets of simulated astronomical observations of clusters of
       galaxies.
   13. P.Kroll described a project that is cataloguing over 2 million
       photographic plates that have imaged the sky. The database can be
       searched here: http://www.skyarchive.org/
   14. R.Nichol gave a very thorough talk on "Computation AstroStatistics:
       How to Mine the Sky Quickly".
   15. A.Szalay and B.Hanisch gave excellent talks on the NVO, large
       surveys, existing tools, challenges, etc.
   16. D.Egret and F.Ochsenbein (from CDS) gave interesting talks on
       mining very large datasets and mining across heterogeneous data
       sets. The challenges of mining legacy catalogs (with inhomogeneous
       column headings, data formats, etc.) were described. Poster papers
       by F.Genova and P.Ortiz summarized additional "mining the sky"
       experience at CDS.
   17. The preparer of this report (K.Borne) gave a poster presentation on
       "Using On-Line Databases to Estimate the Galaxy Interaction Rate:
       Looking Forward to a National Virtual Observatory". The paper for
       the conference proceedings that was derived from this presentation
       is entitled "Data Mining in Astronomical Databases", in which
       aspects of data mining that apply to a variety of science user
       scenarios with a Virtual Observatory (VO) are reviewed. A slightly
       expanded discussion of user requirements for data mining with the
       VO is presented in his Caltech VOF Conference Paper.
   18. There were many more talks and posters not described here, most of
       which can be downloaded from the conference proceedings web site.
