     Q:   How can I report a site that may be contaminated near my
            home?

     A:   By contacting ATSDR, we can direct you to the appropriate
   division
            in our agency.  ATSDR has cooperative agreements
   (partnerships)

   assessments or
            health consultations.

     Q:   Does your agency have a toxicologist available during an
            emergency situation?

     A:   Yes, we have an emergency response team on duty everyday to pro-
            vide technical assistance on health-related situations.

     Q:  Is ATSDR like a poison control center?

     A:   In certain aspects we are similar, but we are more diverse in
   our
            mission for community health. We have toxicologists and other
            health specialists on technical telephone duty everyday, and
   an
            emergency response team to provide technical assistance for
            health-related problems caused by toxic chemical spills or
   releases
            of hazardous substances.

            illnesses related to chemical exposure?

     A:   The ATSDR Information Center refers individuals to member
            clinics of the Association of Occupational and Environmental
            Clinics (AOEC).  Staff at these clinics are medical doctors
   that
            specialize in treating illnesses caused by chemical exposure.
   By
            contacting the  ATSDR Information Center  you can request the
            clinic closest to you.

            hotline numbers?

            numbers contains thousands of biomedical information resources
            including organizations, databases, research institutions, and
   the
            like.  Our list of hotlines includes a variety of groups
   disseminating
            information on a number of health-related concerns.

            possibly contaminated with hazardous substances?

            be able to assist you in finding facilities that are able to
   conduct
            these tests.

     Q:  What is a Superfund site?

     A:   Superfund is the name commonly given to the most hazardous waste
            sites found around the country. ATSDR is responsible for pro-
            tecting the public from adverse health effects associated with
   ex-
            posure to hazardous substances found at these Superfund sites
   as
