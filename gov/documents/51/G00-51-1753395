   There are no Snow Emergency parking restrictions in place today. The
   following is general information about the Citys Night & Day snow
   plowing system:

   When Saint Paul gets 3" or more of snow OR an accumulation of 3" of
   snow over several days, you can expect the City to declare a Snow
   Emergency. Make sure you know the rules below, and -- if your car gets
   towed -- where the impound lot is.

   All streets are either Night Plow Routes or Day Plow Routes.

   Night Plow Routes are plowed from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. the night a Snow
   Emergency is declared. Theyre the busy streets -- marked with signs
   that say NIGHT PLOW ROUTE PLUS one side of north-south residential
   streets with signs that say NIGHT PLOW ROUTE THIS SIDE OF STREET.
   Downtown streets are plowed at night.

   Day Plow Routes have no plowing signs. Theyre plowed from 8 a.m. to 5
   p.m., and normally following night plowing. Theyre east-west
   residential streets PLUS one side of north-south residential streets --
   the side WITHOUT the plowing signs.

   There are some exceptions to these rules, but theyre all well marked.
   Parking is banned until snow is plowed all the way to the curb.

     * Avoid a ticket and a tow! The City now tickets and tows cars before
       the plows begin. The fine for a snow tag is $40. Towing can
       result in substantial towing and storage fees.
     * If you would like to get direct e-mail notification of the next
       Snow Emergency, please join the Snow Emergency Mailing List.
     * NEW! Diagrams that tell you where you can park
     * If you would like a concise, 6" x 9" printout of parking
       regulations for Snow Emergencies, here it is in Adobe Acrobat .pdf
       format. (Its 62k.) NEW! Three non-English versions are available:
          + Spanish
          + Hmong
          + Cambodian
     * If youre going across the river, you may want to check
       Minneapolis web pages to see if theres a Snow Emergency in
       effect.
