   LIAM PEDERSEN PRESENTATION ON THE STATE OF THE ART IN ROBOTICS AT
   LANGLEY WORKSHOP
   Liam Pedersen gave an invited presentation on the current
   state-of-the-art in robotics along with near future projections at the
   ICASE/USRA/LaRC Workshop on Revolutionary Aerospace Systems Concepts
   for Human/Robotic Exploration of the Solar System, held on November 6
   and 7 near Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The purpose of
   the workshop was to gather relevant input from industry, government and
   academic experts to support the development of a preliminary plan to
   maximize the scientific return and enable the human exploration and
   development of space.
