                          Information for Educators

    1. Announcing the Imagine the Universe! Teachers' Forum - We are
       pleased to announce a new service on the Imagine site. Our
       Teachers' Forum is a moderated chat room in which you can exchange
       tips, ideas, and experiences for using Imagine's materials in your
       classroom. You can also ask us questions about using the materials
       and we'll post our answers (or answer them privately if you so
       choose). This feature is being piloted in our Teachers' Corner,
       where there are separate message boards for each of the Lesson
       Plans and sets of Posters and Information/Activity Booklets. So
       check it out, and share your experiences, get some tips, or discuss
       related issues with your fellow teachers.
    2. Updated "Anatomy of Black Holes" Booklet On-line. - Our popular
       booklet on black holes has been updated. We've included more
       illustrations and images, information about the recently discovered
       medium sized black holes, and a new section on the role of black
       holes in the early universe. We've also revised the "Aluminum Foil,
       Balloons and Black Holes" activity based your feedback and the many
       times we've used it in workshops. The updated version is available
       on-line in our Black Holes Booklet page.
        The hard copy booklet will be available soon. Watch this space !
    3. New "Try This!" Activities - Our teacher intern for this summer,
       Ms. Cheryl Carter, developed new "Try This!" activities for a
       number of our science articles. These activities extend the
       exploration of the topic material into areas of astronomy, science
       and math. These are linked from each article under "Try This!" in
       the left-hand sidebar. Look for the new activities in these
       Introductory articles:
          + Electromagnetic Spectrum
          + Gamma-Ray Bursts
          + Multi-wavelength Astronomy
          + Cosmic Rays
          + Diffuse Background
       And in this Advanced article:
          + Supernovae
    4. Life Cycles of Stars Presentation - We have developed a PowerPoint
       presentation on the Life Cycles of Stars which we have used
       recently in teacher workshops. It discusses the life cycle of both
       low mass and high mass stars, and features descriptions of the
       nuclear fusion process which powers all stars. Lots of pretty
       pictures, and the presenter's notes, are included. Download it from
       our Life Cycles of Stars page.
    5. Hidden Lives of Galaxies Presentation Materials - The PowerPoint
       slides used in our "Hidden Lives of Galaxies" workshop are now
       available on the Imagine site. We debuted this workshop at the NSTA
       National Convention in St. Louis in March, and we will to present
       it and update throughout the coming year at state and regional
       educator meetings. Also included in the down-loadable file are
       notes for the presenter. Teachers and Workshop presenters are
       welcome to use the presentation in their work. The PowerPoint file
       is available via the Hidden Lives of Galaxies page. We are also
       pleased to acknowledge the generous submission by Dr. Javier
       Sánchez Quirós, a member of the "Astronomy in Education" Working
       Group in Málaga, Spain, of a Spanish translation of the slides.
       This Spanish version is also available at the location given above.
    6. Any educators who find themselves in the area of Goddard Space
       Flight Center with time to spare should feel free to contact us. We
       can usually schedule a visit and arrange for a high-energy
       scientist to be your host.

                   Where You Can See Us in the Near Future

     We travel to many national and local regional teachers conferences.
                  Here's where we'll be in the near future:

     * NSTA Midwestern Area Convention, Nov 8-10, Columbus, OH.
     * American Association of Physics Teachers National Meeting, Jan
       19-23, 2002, Philadelphia, PA.
     * National Convention of the National Science Teachers Association,
       March 27-30, 2002, San Diego, CA.
