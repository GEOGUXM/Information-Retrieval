   Oceans and coasts are among Americas most treasured natural resources.
   They have been gateways to recreation, commerce and the exploration of
   new frontiers throughout our history, and they are vital to the
   nations future. Oceans provide the nation many unique and valuable
   services from weather, food, jobs and new medicines, to recreation,
   tourism and tranquility. By 2025 nearly 75% of all Americans are
   expected to live in coastal areas. Whether or not we live on the coast,
   oceans affect our lives every day and preserving healthy oceans and
   coasts is critical to Americas future prosperity.

   Human activities are already changing the seas around us. Many ocean
   resources are overused or abused. We need innovative solutions, tools
   and strategies to reverse these trends. Marine protected areas (MPAs)
   are one of these tools. MPAs are proven ways to protect marine life
   habitats, rebuild fisheries, provide recreational opportunities,
   recover endangered species, and support local economies that depend on
   ocean resources.

   In May 2000, President Clinton directed Federal agencies to strengthen
   the protection of U.S. ocean and coastal resources through new actions
   on marine protected areas. This directive was a significant milestone
   for stewardship of U.S. ocean resources. For the first time in history,
   Federal agencies are directed to work closely with local, State,
   territorial, tribal, and other stakeholders to strengthen existing MPAs
   and to build a scientifically-based, national system of MPAs. Building
   this system is perhaps the most important and challenging ocean
   management effort of the 21st century. It will take cooperation and
   strong partnerships, new science and exploration, additional resources
   and good planning. This is not an easy task, and we need to start now.

   The President directed the Departments of Commerce and the Interior to
   inventory MPAs in U.S. waters, provide information on them, and assess
   what is needed to build a national system. From National Marine
   Sanctuaries, National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges to State
   beaches and local marine reserves, MPAs have been established for
   different purposes and described in different ways. As the list of U.S.
   MPAs is developed further, this web site will provide access to the
   list and many other resources on MPAs.

   Everyone can help protect the nations ocean and coastal resources.
   This web site is designed to provide information, facilitate
   partnerships, identify key needs and challenges, and encourage public
   participation in the design, implementation and evaluation of U.S.
   MPAs. We welcome your thoughts and suggestions on the web site, and
   encourage you to participate in this important work.
