   Coastal erosion is a serious national problem with long-term economic
   and social consequences. Developed areas are threatened with billions
   of dollars in property damage as a result of storm impacts and
   long-term erosion. Over the last few decades, data on the position of
   the shoreline has emerged as the principal source of information for
   local, state, and federal government agencies charged with managing
   coastal erosion. This measure of the shifting land/water interface is
   also an important source of information for scientific investigations
   of coastal change, for determinations of the sediment budget, and for
   conducting numerical simulations of shoreline change.
   Despite the importance of this measure of coastal change, the methods
   available for collecting shoreline position data are very limited. The
   most commonly applied method-shoreline interpretation from aerial
   photography-is expensive, labor-intensive, and involves a considerable
   amount of subjectivity in identifying the shoreline. There is a
   significant need for a method that can provide an unambiguous and
   repeatable measure of shoreline position, can cover large sections of
   coast within a single low tide period, is inexpensive to operate, and
   can be used for both long-term monitoring and rapid-response surveys of
   storm impacts. In response to this need, the USGS developed SWASH, a
   vehicle-based system for measuring shoreline position which utilizes
   recent advances in the Global Positioning System (GPS). SWASH stands
   for "Surveying Wide-Area Shorelines."

Methodology

   Schematic of SWASH system methodology The SWASH system is mounted on a
   six-wheel amphibious all-terrain vehicle (click here for image of the
   buggy and details of instruments used). As the vehicle transits the
   coast, an array of GPS sensors are used to make high-accuracy
   measurements of horizontal position, vertical position, and beach
   slope. Following the field survey, position and slope data are combined
   to compute shoreline position, defined as the horizontal location of a
   target elevation contour's intersection with the beach. See SWASH
   schematic for more details. In keeping with historical sources on
   shoreline information, the Mean High Water (MHW) contour is usually
   chosen as the definition of the shoreline.
   In contrast to shorelines derived by most previous methods, SWASH
   shorelines have well-defined error bars, important for determining the
   statistical significance of shoreline change. Error bars are calculated
   on a point-by-point basis as a function of beach slope and the
   deviation between the elevation driven and MHW. SWASH can survey more
   than 70 km of shoreline within a single low tide period and provide
   near real-time information on shoreline changes during storms. SWASH is
   also very inexpensive to operate relative to previous methods for
   obtaining shoreline position.

Current Survey Program and Example Results

   Line graph showing example shoreline change results using the SWASH
   system The SWASH system is currently being applied to study
   storm-induced and fair weather shoreline change on beaches in North
   Carolina and Massachusetts. The most extensive set of measurements are
   within the Cape Cod National Seashore, where both the short-term impact
   of storms and the longer seasonal cycle of change has been measured in
   a continuing survey program initiated in April 1998. This study area
   map shows the along-coast reference line used in the following example
   results. An example of the short-term impact of a Northeaster storm on
   45 km of Cape Cod's outer coast is given in this figure. The shoreline
   erosion response was extraordinarily non-uniform, with zones of
   significant erosion (more than 20 m of shoreline recession) alternating
   with zones of virtual stability (less than 2 m of change). In the
   period of decreasing waves following the storm, the pattern of change
   almost entirely reversed, with the erosional zones showing strong
   accretion and the stable zones still exhibiting no significant change.
   Similar results have been obtained for other storms on Cape Cod, as
   well as along the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Although the processes
   responsible for these erosional "hotspots" are unknown, their
   identification has important implications for management of both
   cultural and environmental resources along the coast. Research is
   ongoing to better characterize the locations and persistence of
   erosional hotspots and to understand their cause or causes.
   The seasonal cycle of shoreline position variability on Cape Cod is
   given in this figure. Shoreline position is averaged over the
   "bluff-backed coast" (kilometers 17.5 to 45.0 on the Cape Cod study
   area map) and plotted as a function of time since the first survey in
   April 1998. Although much variability exists from survey to survey,
   there is a clear yearly signal of erosion and accretion which is tied
   to variations in overall storminess between winter and summer. This
   data series, when extended for several more years, will help
   characterize the natural high-frequency variability of shoreline
   position, both in winter and summer, information important for
   quantifying the error in estimates of long-term shoreline change.
