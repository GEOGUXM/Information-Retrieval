             New Optional Soil and Air Temp Data Logger Protocol

   Have you ever wondered how hibernating animals survive the winter in
   their burrows or why a cement walkway feels so cold in the morning?
   Studies of diurnal soil and air temperature records can help you answer
   both questions. Daily soil temperature data collected using the current
   GLOBE Soil Temperature protocol are important for research but
   measurements taken many times each day and at 50 cm depth in addition
   to 5 cm and 10 cm open many additional areas of investigation.

   Starting today, GLOBE is expanding its soil and air temperature
   measurement capabilities by announcing the optional Automated Soil and
   Air Temperature Monitoring Protocol. This protocol allows for the
   collection of soil and air temperatures every 15 minutes using a small
   but capable data logger.

   This data logger is like a mini computer and is as small as a deck of
   cards. It is programmed to read and store temperature readings again
   and again. In this new protocol, you will use the data logger to record
   air temperature and soil temperatures from depths of 5, 10 and 50 cm. A
   recent reduction in cost has made this powerful technology affordable
   for some schools.

   One potential benefit of data loggers is that they will enable more
   schools to collect temperature data more consistently because loggers
   can collect data for weeks at a time, during periods when students are
   unable to collect data manually. It is important to stress that this
   protocol does not replace any existing measurements. Like any
   instrument, the data logger and sensors are susceptible to carelessness
   and physical degradation, although they are designed to provide years
   of service. GLOBE relies on the student-collected direct observations
   as the calibration and standard against which we will judge the
   stability and accuracy of the automated measurements.

   Scientists strive to understand patterns and trends in data. This new
   protocol will give scientists and students access to a much richer and
   more detailed view of the interactions between soil and air temperature
   at GLOBE study sites around the world. In addition, schools may be able
   to collect data from remote sites by using data loggers. Data can be
   collected for weeks during times when no one is able to physically
   visit such sites.

   Monitoring Protocol, check out this link. I look forward to answering
   your questions about this new protocol and to seeing the wealth of data
   that some schools will provide.
