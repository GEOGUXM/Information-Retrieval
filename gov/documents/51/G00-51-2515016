   Purpose
   These data are collected to assist consumers of air transportation in
   making decisions based on air carrier service quality.
   Coverage Airlines
   Currently, the on-time performance database tracks Alaska, America
   West, American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, Southwest, TWA, United,
   and USAIR. These airlines account for more than 90% of domestic
   operating revenues. Each of these airlines earns 1% or more of total
   domestic scheduled passenger revenue; therefore Federal regulations
   require that they report on-time performance data.

   Routes
   The database covers the entire domestic system of the ten reporting
   airlines. Federal regulations require the ten airlines to report on
   operations to and from the 27 largest airports. The airlines
   voluntarily report on the rest.
   Flights
   As of January, 1995, all flights shown in the airlines' Computerized
   Reservation Systems (CRS) are tracked in the database for the purpose
   of determining what proportion of flights was on-time. This includes
   canceled and diverted flights as well as flights affected by mechanical
   problems. From September, 1987 to December, 1994, flight delays or
   cancellations due to mechanical problems were treated differently. If a
   mechanical problem caused a flight to be late or to be canceled, the
   flight was not reported. Definitions Scheduled departure and arrival
   times We use the times shown in the airlines' Computerized Reservation
   Systems (CRS). For the monthly summary data shown on the BTS web site,
   we use the departure and arrival time for the last flight of the month
   for that flight number. Note that flight schedules are subject to
   change. During the month, a given flight may operate at various times.
   Actual departure and arrival times Actual departure time is the time
   when the flight left the gate, the "gate departure time". Actual
   arrival time is the time the flight arrived at the gate, the "gate
   arrival time".
   On-time flights
   A flight is counted as "on time" if it arrived at the gate no more than
   15 minutes after the scheduled arrival time shown in the carriers'
   Computerized Reservations Systems. Thus, neither diverted nor canceled
   flights count as "on-time Average minutes late." Canceled and diverted
   operations are counted as late, but they are not included in the
   calculation of average or median minutes late.
   Frequency
   U.S. DOT collects and publishes this information monthly. Generally,
   the data are released within 40 days after the end of the reporting
   month. For example, data for May, 1998 should be available by July 10,
   1998.
