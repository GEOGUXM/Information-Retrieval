      H.R. 3338 -- Department of Defense Appropriation Bill for FY 2002

     Calendar No. 254

     Reported with an amendment in the nature of a substitute from the
     Committee on Appropriations on December 4, 2001, by a vote of 29-0;
     no written report.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                 NOTEWORTHY
     __________________________________________________________________

     * By unanimous consent, the Senate will proceed to the consideration
       of H.R. 3338 today. Several budget points of order lie against the
       bill as reported, including a point of order for the emergency
       spending designation of the Byrd supplemental.

     * H.R. 3338 provides $317.2 billion in new spending authority for the
       Department of Defense for FY 2002, consistent with the budget
       authority and outlay limits established in the 302(b) allocation,
       as revised, and is $26.6 billion more than was appropriated last
       year.
     * The reported bill contains four new divisions, including a $15
       billion supplemental section, authored by Chairman Byrd [see
       attached itemization]. Recall that last month, Senator Byrd planned
       to offer a $15 billion supplemental spending package to H.R. 3090,
       the stimulus bill, but then announced he would offer a package to
       the defense bill instead. The bill contains the regular FY 2002
       appropriations as reported by the Defense subcommittee, plus these
       four divisions:

     -- The second $20 billion from the $40 billion in emergency funding
     for fighting terrorism, as provided by P.L. 107-38;
     -- An additional $15 billion authored by Chairman Byrd to provide
     supplemental spending for "homeland defense" and domestic recovery;
     -- Various technical corrections; and
     -- Language providing an increase in the statutory discretionary
     spending caps to $686 billion, reflecting the level agreed upon by
     members of Congress and the President in early October.

     * The President has repeatedly stated he will veto any bill that
       provides discretionary spending beyond the agreed upon levels.
     * H.R. 3338 provides: an average 5-percent military personnel pay
       raise; $18.38 billion for the Defense Health Program; $2.66 billion
       to procure 13 F-22 fighter aircraft; $2.97 billion to procure 3
       DDG-51 class destroyers; and $8.3 billion for Ballistic Missile
       Defense activities.

                                 BACKGROUND
     __________________________________________________________________

     H.R. 3338 makes appropriations for the military functions of the
     Department of Defense (DoD) for the period of October 1, 2001
     through September 30, 2002. Functional areas include the pay,
     allowances and support of military personnel, operation and
     maintenance of the forces, procurement of equipment and systems, and
     research, development, test, and evaluation. Appropriations for
     military assistance, military construction, family housing, nuclear
     weapons programs, and civil defense are provided in other bills.

     The Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations began hearings on the FY
     2002 budget request on February 28, 2001, and concluded them on
     September 5, 2001, after 11 separate sessions. The subcommittee
     heard testimony from representatives of the Department of Defense,
     other Federal agencies, representatives of organizations, and the
     public.

     The House of Representatives passed its bill, H.R. 3338, on November
     28, 2001, by a vote of 406-20. That bill contains a new title (Title
     IX, Counter-Terrorism & Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction)
     with programs funded at $11.7 billion. The Senate bill does not
     contain this new title; however, the Senate bill does include a new
     provision (Section 8111) which provides an additional $1.3 billion
     for ballistic missile defense and/or counterterrorism activities.
     This is consistent with a provision in the FY 2002 Defense
     Authorization bill (which remains in conference with the House).
     __________________________________________________________________

                                 HIGHLIGHTS
     __________________________________________________________________

     The bill provides a total of $317.2 billion in new spending
     authority for the Department of Defense for FY 2002 (not including
     the supplemental funds provided by Senator Byrd in Divisions B and
     C). The recommendation by the Committee meets the budget authority
     and outlay limits established in the 302(b) allocation, as revised
     to comport with the agreement reached on October 2, 2001 between the
     Congress and the President. The bill provides $26.6 billion more
     than was appropriated for FY 2001. While the Committee's total
     302(b) allocation for Function 050 Defense programs matches the
     President's requested level, adjustments for Military Construction
     (an additional $500 million) and Department of Energy Nuclear
     Weapons Activities (an additional $1.2 billion) results in the
     allocation for the Defense Subcommittee falling $1.9 billion below
     the level of the President's amended budget request.

     The divisions to the bill as reported to the Senate are: Division A
     - the Senate substitute as reported by the Defense Subcommittee
     which contains the regular FY2002 defense appropriations; Division B
     - the second $20 billion from the $40 billion in emergency
     supplemental funding for fighting terrorism provided for in P.L.
     107-38; Division C - the Byrd $15 supplemental spending for
     "homeland defense," which includes $7.5 billion for FEMA funds, most
     of which will go to New York and the other $7.5 billion divided
     among several agencies, including $3.4 billion for the Department of
     Health and Human Services, $1.3 billion for the Department of
     Justice, $465 million for the Department of Transportation, and $875
     million for the Postal Service [see attachment for further details];
     Division D - language providing an increase in the statutory
     discretionary spending caps to the agreed-upon level of $686
     billion; and Division E - technical corrections.

     [Note: A breakdown of the additional $15 billion Byrd supplemental,
     and of the emergency supplemental to address the President's
     requested programs and funding levels for the use of the second half
     of the $40 billion supplemental appropriation ($7.47 for defense and
     $12.53 for nondefense) can be found as attachments at the end of
     this Legislative Notice.]

     President's Response to the Byrd Supplemental

     In response to the $15 billion in supplemental funds provided by
     this bill that were not requested by the President, Director of
     Homeland Security Tom Ridge on November 28 wrote a letter to
     Majority Leader Daschle, noting that "the level the president has
     recommended is sufficient to meet the immediate requirements we have
     identified." Governor Ridge noted that the $40 billion emergency
     funding bill, P.L. 107-38, is what the Administration "is relying
     on. . . to prosecute the war on terrorism and to protect the
     homeland." He added, "Therefore, and in large part because of
     Congress's quick, bipartisan response, no additional resources
     beyond what the President has already requested are needed at this
     time."

     Governor Ridge noted to Senator Daschle that additional funds
     probably will be needed in the future, "but we will not know
     precisely when, where, or in what amount resources will be required
     until we have clearly defined our objectives and completed our
     analysis of the needs." Further, Governor Ridge noted he was
     responsible for reporting to the President, adding:

     "As we identify urgent needs and our top priorities, I will be
     making specific recommendations for the President. This process has
     already begun. I am also working with the Office of Management and
     Budget to prepare a FY 2003 budget request that fulfills critical
     homeland security priorities. And as part of developing a national
     strategy, the Office of Homeland Security will coordinate the
     development of a multi-year, all-agency budget plan that address the
     nation's homeland security needs in a systematic, complete, and
     forward-looking manner. The Administration, of course, looks forward
     to consulting with the Congress as we develop and begin implementing
     this strategy."

     Budget Points of Order

     Both the House-passed DoD Appropriations bill and the
     Senate-reported bill are subject to a point of order for exceeding
     the discretionary spending caps. Congress and the President agreed
     on October 2, 2001, to revise the discretionary spending caps to a
     level of $686 billion. Language in the bill does that, but the bill
     still is subject to a 312 (b) point of order for exceeding the
     discretionary spending limits set out in section 251(c) of the
     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act.

     The bill language providing the additional $20 billion in emergency
     spending for response to terrorism, Division B, does not subject the
     bill to a budget point of order since it conforms to the emergency
     provisions provided by the Emergency Supplemental, P.L. 107-38.
     However, note that the package differs both from that requested by
     the President (see attachment) and from the package approved by the
     House.

     The $15 billion in supplemental spending authored by Senator Byrd
     and offered during the full committee markup, Division C, includes
     an emergency designation. In the Budget Resolution for FY 2001,
     Congress established a 60-vote threshold for emergency designations
     in the Senate. If the supplemental title's emergency designation is
     struck, then the entire bill as reported is subject to a 302(f)
     point of order for exceeding both the Appropriations Committee
     302(a) allocation and the Defense subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.

     Veto Threat

     Furthermore, the Byrd supplemental title violates the agreement
     between the Congress and the President of October 2 to hold
     discretionary spending to $686 billion plus the $40 billion in
     additional spending agreed to immediately after September 11; the
     bill thus invites a veto. A Statement of Administration Policy on
     the House Defense Appropriations bill issued on November 28 states,
     "The President's senior advisers would recommend that the President
     veto any bill that provides discretionary spending beyond these
     agreed upon levels."
     __________________________________________________________________

                               BILL PROVISIONS
     __________________________________________________________________

     Title I -- Military Personnel

     Funds appropriated under this title pay for basic pay, retired pay
     accrual, employer's contribution for Social Security taxes, basic
     allowance for housing, basic allowance for subsistence, special
     incentive pays, permanent change of station travel, and other
     personnel costs for uniformed members of the Armed Forces.
     * An average 5 percent military pay raise is fully funded by the
       bill.
     * The bill funds 1,387,400) active duty military personnel,
       consistent with the Senate reported Defense Authorization Act. The
       Reserve and National Guard personnel levels are appropriated at
       864,658, the same as the budget request.
     * Out of pocket housing costs are reduced from 15 percent in 2001 to
       11.3 percent in 2002, on track to eliminate out of pocket expenses
       entirely by 2005.

     * The Committee directs the Defense Secretary to develop a
       comprehensive plan to reduce the rate of permanent change of
       station moves, and reduces that budget by $317 million.

     Title II -- Operation and Maintenance (O&M)

     O&M provide the resources required by the U.S. Armed Forces, and
     supporting defense agencies, to prepare for and conduct combat
     operations and other peacetime missions. These funds are used to
     purchase fuel and spare parts for training operations, pay
     supporting civilian personnel, and purchase supplies, equipment, and
     service contracts for the repair of weapons facilities.
     * Overall, the bill provides $106.44 billion for DoD operation and
       maintenance. This is $343.76 million below the budget estimate.
     * The Committee provides an increase of $9.55 billion over the FY
       2001 level for operation and maintenance to fund service priority
       readiness, training and depot support programs.
     * The bill provides $2.24 billion for overseas contingency operations
       in Southwest Asia, Kosovo and Bosnia, $600 million less than the
       budget request. The funds are directly provided to the military
       service O&M accounts for FY 2002 and beyond, rather than providing
       money to the overseas contingency operations transfer account, in
       the expectation that such direct funding will improve financial
       accountability.
     * A total of $1.29 billion is provided for Environmental Restoration.
       An additional $40 million appropriation is provided to address
       environmental issues at formerly used defense sites.
     * The Committee recommends an appropriation of $44.7 million for
       overseas humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
     * The bill provides $357 million for Former Soviet Union Threat
       Reduction -- a cut of $46 million from the budget request. The
       Committee recommends that $15 million be reserved only to support
       the dismantling and disposal of nuclear submarines in the Russian
       Far East.
     * The Committee recommends $15.8 million, the requested amount, for
       security support to the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Utah.

     Title III -- Procurement

     Funds appropriated under this title provide the resources required
     to purchase military equipment and hardware, including aircraft,
     helicopters, ships, missiles, combat vehicles, ammunition, weapons,
     electronic sensors and communications equipment, and other
     procurement items.
     * The President requested a total of $60.44 billion for FY 2002 DoD
       procurement. The Committee recommends $60.89 billion, which is
       approximately $458.74 million above the requested level.
     * The Committee recommends an additional $102.5 million for the
       procurement of 10 Blackhawk (UH-60) helicopters for the Army
       National Guard.

     * An appropriation of $2.17 billion is provided for the procurement
       of Army weapons and tracked combat vehicles, $102.2 million below
       the budget request.
     * The Committee fully funds the Army's Transformation initiatives.
     * The Committee recommends reducing the funding requested for V-22
       aircraft purchases to the level approved by the Senate in the FY
       2002 Defense Authorization bill. Funding also is reduced for
       advance procurement, spares, and modernization in a manner
       consistent with the reduction in aircraft purchase levels.
     * The President's budget requests $559.0 million for the Trident II
       program. Within this request is $107 million for the D-5 life
       extension program. The Committee is not opposed to the program;
       however, feels it is premature to invest such funding prior to the
       Department making a clear determination regarding the future of
       nuclear programs. Therefore, the Committee recommends a $50 million
       reduction in the life extension program.
     * The President's budget request included funding to begin the
       conversion of two Trident submarines into the SSGN (nuclear powered
       guided-missile submarine) configuration. The Committee recommends
       $279.4 million, an increase of $193 million to the budget request,
       for acceleration of the Trident SSGN conversion program and to
       preserve the option to convert all four available Trident
       submarines into SSGNs.
     * The bill provides $783 million to procure 9 MV-22 aircraft.
     * The Committee recommends $2.66 billion to procure 13 F-22 fighter
       aircraft, the requested level.
     * The bill provides $725 million for increased Prior Year ship costs.
     * A total of $653 million is provided for 72 Patriot PAC-3 missiles.
     * The Committee recommends $3.04 billion to procure 48 F-18E/F
       fighters.
     * The budget request included $2.87 billion for the procurement of 15
       C-17A aircraft in FY 2002. The Committee believes that there is a
       requirement for increased airlift and an opportunity to achieve
       savings with a follow-on multi-year procurement. Therefore, the
       Committee recommends an additional $143 million in advance
       procurement funding to initiate a follow-on C-17 multi-year
       procurement program.
     * The Committee denies the entire request of $93.8 million in advance
       procurement for the Space-Based Infra-Red System (SBIRS) High, and
       $54.3 million in Other Air Force Procurement for the procurement of
       hardware associated with a backup ground station. The Committee,
       however, recommends an additional $50 million in the RDT&E Air
       Force appropriation for SBIRS (High) to begin to address program
       deficiencies.

     * The Committee recommends an additional $182.2 million for the
       procurement of two C-130J aircraft for the Air National Guard.

     Title IV -- Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E)

     Funds appropriated under this title provide the resources required
     to conduct a program of research, development, test and evaluation,
     including research in basic science, applied research, advanced
     technology development, demonstration and validation, engineering
     and manufacturing development, and operational systems development.
     * The President's FY 2002 budget requests a total of $47.43 billion
       for research, development, test and evaluation appropriations
       (RDT&E). The Committee recommends $45.99 billion, which is $1.43
       billion below the budget request.
     * The President's budget request included $1.54 billion for the Joint
       Strike Fighter (JSF) in both the Navy and Air Force research and
       development budgets. The Committee recommends a reduction of $247.2
       million to the budget request, evenly divided between the Navy and
       Air Force budget requests, and an additional $30 million for each
       service to transition to the engineering and manufacturing
       development (EMD) phase of the program consistent with the
       recommendation of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
     * The Committee recommends funding for Ballistic Missile Defense
       (BMD) programs at $8.3 billion, as follows: The total from RDT&E
       and Missile Procurement, Army, is appropriated at $6.99 billion, a
       reduction of $1.29 billion from the request. This is consistent
       with the aggregate level approved in the Senate version of the FY
       2002 Defense Authorization bill. In addition, a general provision
       (Section 8111) provides $1.3 billion for missile defense and/or
       counter-terrorism programs, also consistent with the FY 2002
       Defense Authorization bill.
     * The bill funds the SBIRS Low program at the Senate-authorized
       level, which is $97 million below the President's request.

     Title VI -- Other Department of Defense Appropriations
     * The Committee recommends an appropriation of $18.38 billion for the
       Defense Health Program, which is $477.5 million above the budget
       request.
     * The bill provides the requested amount, $3.9 billion, to implement
       the retiree health benefits plan.
     * An additional $387 million is provided for Defense medical research
       programs, including $175 million for breast cancer research and
       $100 million for prostate cancer research.
     * The Committee recommends an appropriation of $866 million for Drug
       Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities, which is $45.6 million
       above the budget request.
     * The Committee makes the following adjustments to the National Guard
       and Reserves:

          + --Adds $38.6 million for Army Guard personnel
          + --Adds $66.4 million for Army Guard operation and maintenance
            programs
          + --Adds $131 million for Air Guard operation and maintenance
            programs
          + --Provides $100 million for Air Guard B-1 operations
          + --Adds $560.5 million for National Guard and Reserve equipment
          + --Adds $40 million for National Guard counterdrug missions.
