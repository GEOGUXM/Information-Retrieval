   Craig Webb

   Another very good day for collecting data.  After today I will contact
   NREL and have them check and see if there is enough data to conclude
   BORCAL 2001-02.

   20010909

   Craig Webb

   Fired up BORCAL 2001-02 today and ran all day, collected some very good
   data.

   20010829

   Craig Webb

   Just got thru the zenith angle of 55 – to –45 and clouds moved in and
   ended the borcal for the day.

   20010828

   Craig Webb

   Fired up Borcal 2001-02 was able to run till the end of solar noon then
   clouds moved in.

   20010827

   Craig Webb

   Started Borcal at 0610 and ran all day long.  One very good day.

   20010821

   Craig Webb

   Everything is ready for BORCAL 2001-02 .  Radiometers were installed
   and the database was created. The light dark test was completed and one
   test session was conducted.  Just waiting on weather to proceed.

   20010816

   Craig Webb

   All the radiometers that were calibrated have been installed in the
   field.  The radiometers that were returned to the RCF will be inspected
   and installed on the RCF tables.

   20010803

   Craig Webb

   Steve Wilcox called and informed me that there was enough data to
   conclude BORCAL 2001-01.  There will be about a ten day period between
   the next BORCAL # 2001-02.

   20010723

   Craig Webb

   Good day for BORCAL.  Ran the whole day.  Notified Steve Wilcox to see
   if there is enough data to complete this BORCAL.

   20010720

   Craig Webb

   Good morning for BORCAL, clouds caused to shut down just before solar
   noon.  NREL installed revision 0.20 this morning.

   20010719

   Craig Webb

   Run BORCAL 2001-01 till after solar noon when clouds moved in.

   20010718

   Craig Webb

   Started BORCAL today after clouds lifted. at a zenith angle of 56,
   configured to run with one cavity due to wind speed and direction.
   Clouds caused shut down of BORCAL for the day.

   20010712

   Craig Webb

   Conditions suitable for running BORCAL till 1345 CST.

   20010711

   Craig Webb

   Conditions are fair for running BORCAL again today.  Conditions were
   favorable till  a zenith of 70 degrees in the pm.

   20010710

   Craig Webb

   Second day of running for BORCAL 2001-01

   20010709

   Craig Webb

   First day following RCC upgrade that was appropriate for BORCAL.

   20010625

   Dan Nelson

   NREL (Steve Wilcox and Afshin Andreas) is on site to upgrade the RCC
   system.  Work includes new software, a new PC, and new custom-built ACR
   controllers.  The first BORCAL of 2001 is expected to begin immediately
   following the completion of these upgrades.

   20000228

    Dan Nelson

    BORCAL season officially begins today.  However, NREL has discovered a
   Y2K issue with the RCC software that runs the calibration process.
   Currently, they estimate that new software will be available by the end
   of April 2000.  Until that time, SGP is on hold with regard to
   radiometer calibration.

   19990802

   Dan Nelson

   All BORCAL 1999-02 results sent to NREL (Steve Wilcox) for evaluation.

    19990730

    Dan Nelson

   Conditions favorable for all day calibration. Diffuse component getting
   above 20% in the late afternoon and early evening halted BORCAL
   activities around a zenith of 70d.

    19990729

   Dan Nelson

   Conditions favorable for morning calibration. Few scattered thin cirrus
   moving off to the east. Building cumulus halted activities just before
   solar noon.

   19990725

   Dan Nelson

   Conditions favorable for afternoon and early evening calibration.

   19990724

   Dan Nelson

   Conditions favorable for afternoon and early evening calibration.

   19990721

   Dan Nelson

   Conditions favorable for morning calibration. Building cumulus halted
   activities just before solar noon.

    19990720

    Dan Nelson

    Conditions favorable for morning calibration. Building cumulus and
   smoke from field burning to the SE halted activities just before solar
   noon.

   19990719

   Dan Nelson

   Conditions favorable for morning calibration. Building cumulus and
   smoke from field burning to the SE halted activities just before solar
   noon.

   19990718

   Dan Nelson

   Conditions favorable for morning calibration. Building cumulus halted
   activities just before solar noon.

   19990713

   Dan Nelson

   Conditions nearly perfect for a full days calibration. Unfortunately,
   equipment problems have cost us several morning sessions, including
   44-55.

   19990709

    Dan Nelson

   Conditions favorably for calibration through solar noon. Significant
   thin Cirrus halted work just pas solar noon.

   19990708

    Dan Nelson

   BORCAL 1999-02 began this morning. Conditions are predicted to be
   favorable for most of the day.

    19990629

   Dan Nelson

   SIRS PSPs and NIPs are being exchanged this week for the southern half
   of the SGP CART site. Additionally, problematic SIRS instruments at E09
   & E10 are also being exchanged. SRS C1 (Test Bed) is also in the
   process of being exchanged. So far, we are on schedule to begin the
   next BORCAL (1999-02)near the end of next week.


   Last week, Jim Treadwell (NREL) was on site to perform testing of the
   RCC system. Certain anomalies within the data for BORCAL 1999-01
   prompted these tests. Jim found two loose connections on data
   connectors feeding into the Helios datalogger which he corrected. Steve
   Wilcox, creator of the RCC program, suspects that these two problems
   coupled with our (Site Ops) improper removal of an instrument under
   test could yield spurious data. In the future, if an instrument (other
   than a cavity radiometer) fails during any phase of an ongoing BORCAL,
   it should be "Deactivated" rather than "Suspended" to avoid this
   problem.

    19990621

   Dan Nelson

   Received notification from NREL that BORCAL 1999-01 is complete and
   that the final report is ready for signature. Calibration tags should
   be ready this week. Radiometer exchange could begin next week and the
   next BORCAL started on or about 19990709.

    19990525

    Dan Nelson

    BORCAL results zipped up and shipped to Steve Wilcox at NREL for
   evaluation. Pending his review, BORCAL activities have been suspended.

   19990524

   Craig Webb

   BORCAL started this morning at 0700CST. Cirrus drifted in within a
   couple of hours to halt BORCAL efforts.

   19990519

   Dan Nelson

   BORCAL started this morning at 0730CST.  Few cirrus low to the east
   prevented an earlier start.

   19990518

   Dan Nelson

   BORCAL started this morning at 0700CST.

   19990515 thru
   19990517

   Dan Nelson

   No BORCAL today.  Total OVC.

   19990514

   Craig Webb

   No BORCAL today.  Total OVC.

   19990513

   Dan Nelson

   No BORCAL today.  Significant cirrus overhead.

   19990512

   Dan Nelson

   BORCAL system brought back on line after restoring portions of the RCC
   PC hard drive from tape backup.  Calibration from just prior to solar
   noon until mid afternoon was possible before significant cumulus
   developed.

   19990507

   Dan Nelson

   BORCAL system failed this morning.  There appears to be some sort of
   corruption within the RCC program.  NREL has been called to address
   this issue.

   19990501 thru
   19990506

   Dan Nelson

   No BORCAL.  Weather conditions unfavorable for operation.

   19990415 thru
   19990530

   Dan Nelson

   BORCAL when possible.  I will be away on vacation.  Craig Webb will be
   responsible for operating the RCF in my absence.  Craig does not have
   access to edit this page at the present.  When I return from vacation,
   I will arrange for him to have access to edit this page.

   19990405

   Dan Nelson

   Setup continues for SGP BORCAL 1999-01.  Pre calibration testing will
   take place later this week.

   19990330

   Dan Nelson

   Approval was given by Tom Stoffel (NREL) at last week's STM for Site
   Operations to prepare for the 1999 SGP BORCAL season.  This work will
   require several days and should finish up sometime next week.

   19980914

   Dan Nelson

   With the end of the calibration season nearly upon us and given that
   any radiometers calibrated during this BORCAL season would require
   calibration again next spring, Tom Stoffel and I have elected to forego
   further calibrations this year.  Look for new entries to this log early
   next spring.

   19980826

   Dan Nelson

   BORCAL 1998-02 complete!  The following is an excerpt from a message
   sent to us by Steve Wilcox of NREL following his review of the RCC data
   we recently sent to them.

   Dan,

   We've looked at the BORCAL.  Looks good!  The results for the MAS and
   control instruments are consistent with previous BORCALs.  There is a
   gap of data in the afternoon, but it appears that each afternoon bin on
   either side has some data, so the effect is minimal.

   Questions:

   What happened to the humidity sensor?  It looks like it failed part way
   through.

   We would like a copy of all session logs (copy and mail to us;
   conventional mail is okay).

   Go ahead and tear down.  We'll prepare the calibration report here and
   make copies for distribution.  We'll also produce the calibration
   stickers here for each instrument and send them to you.

   Thanks for all the good work.

   Steve

   With adequate AM BORCAL samples in hand, we will now concentrate on
   obtaining good PM data.  Up to this point, our attempts to gather PM
   data have been foiled by low cumulus forming around solar noon.  The
   NWS is calling for mostly sunny for the entire day today.  With any
   luck, we may just get our first PM data in a good many days.

   19980818

   Dan Nelson

   AM BORCAL attempt.  Clear skies this morning.  PM remains questionable
   at this point, but we will run RCC as long as the skies cooperate.

   Shade & unshade testing prior to commencement of SGP BORCAL 1998-02 was
   performed today.  All systems are go for starting this activity and all
   we require now are clear skies.

   Today will not be a clear sky day at the SGP RCF.  Also, NWS
   predictions for clear skies over the weekend do not appear favorable
   for BORCAL activities.  Therefore no weekend calibration work will be
   scheduled.

   19980709

   Dan Nelson

   Preparations for SGP BORCAL 1998-02 continue this week.  The start of
   1998-02 could begin by the week's end.  However, based on the attached
   NWS zone forecast, the remainder of the week appear to be questionable
   for BORCAL activities.  The weekend looks good right now, but we will
   continue to monitor the NWS forecast for the remainder of the week to
   see if this prediction holds.

   Preparations for SGP BORCAL 1998-02 continue this week.  The start of
   1998-02 could begin by the week's end.

   NREL has requested that we exchange our Measurement Assurance Standards
   (MAS), returning the set used in SGP BORCAL 1998-01 to SSRL for
   calibration in their upcoming BORCAL.  To that end, we have returned
   MAS set #2 and installed MAS set #1 for the upcoming BORCAL.

   19980707

   Dan Nelson

   Preparations for SGP BORCAL 1998-02 continue this week.  The start of
   1998-02 could begin by the week's end.

   19980706

   Dan Nelson

   Preparations for SGP BORCAL 1998-02 continue this week.  The start of
   1998-02 could begin by the week's end.

   19980702

   Dan Nelson

   Preparations for SGP BORCAL 1998-02 began this morning with inventory
   and inspection of all recently exchanged NIP and PSP radiometers.  This
   work will continue for several days and include RCC channel and deck
   location assignment.

   19980629

   Dan Nelson

   Radiometer calibration tags and reports for SGP BORCAL 1998-01 were
   received from NREL last week.  These tags were installed and the
   radiometers were assigned for field exchange to take place at all
   southern EF SIRS during this week.  Additionally, we will also exchange
   radiometers at the four northern EF SIRS and the CF (E13) during this
   week.

   Following the 4th of July holiday, we will begin preparations for SGP
   BORCAL 1998-02.  This work should be completed by 19980710 and data
   gathering will commence at our first available opportunity.

   19980603

   Dan Nelson

   BORCAL 1998-01 data gathering is complete. NREL is satisfied with the
   data gathered thus far.

   Site Operations will generate and forward the final BORCAL 1998-01
   report to NREL for processing.  NREL will prepare calibration tags and
   forward them to the site for installation onto the appropriate
   radiometers.  Following receipt and installation of the calibration
   tags (2-3 weeks from today), Site Operations will assign the freshly
   calibrated radiometers so they may be exchanged for 50% of the existing
   fielded radiometers.  These returned instruments will be prepared for
   the next BORCAL.

   Expect no further entries to this log until the RCF operators begin
   preparations for BORCAL 1998-02 sometime in July.

   19980529 to

   BORCAL 1998-01 data forwarded to NREL for evaluation.

   There will be no further data gathering until these results are
   analyzed.

   questionable.

   19980516

   Dan Nelson

   BORCAL AM & PM.  Severely clear skies potentially offers us one of the
   best calibration days of the season so far.

   BORCAL update.  Murphy's law of solar radiometer calibration has struck
   us down.  Sometime just after solar noon, solar tracker #1 began acting
   up.  Azimuthal rotation was not smooth in either clock or sun modes.
   The tracker would lag behind by several degrees and then slowly catch
   up.  This solar tracker points our windowless HF-ACR and both of the
   diffuse reference radiometer's shading assembly.  Attempting BORCAL
   with this type of solar tracking error condition will lead to
   significantly erroneous calibration results.

   The SGP RCF maintains a spare Brusag solar tracker on hand (good
   foresight on NREL's part), so I elected to exchange the spare for the
   faulty unit.  This effort required most of the afternoon because of the
   significant hardware exchange and precise alignment requirements
   associated with this activity.  The new unit was brought online at
   about 75 degrees zenith angle.  Both clock and solar tracking modes
   yielded pointing values within <0.2 degrees of one another, indicating
   extremely close initial alignment.  The tracker was placed in solar
   mode as recommended by the manufacturer and left for the night.
   Attempting further calibration at this late solar hour was deemed not
   worth the bother.  I will check the solar pointing accuracy of this
   tracker in the morning.

   19980515

   Dan Nelson

   PM BORCAL will be attempted despite high southerly winds.  NREL has
   outlined a method for suspending the windowless HF-ACR from the BORCAL
   during these frequent high wind, but very clear sky days.  The HF-ACR
   can be reinstated into the ongoing BORCAL when wind conditions allow;
   typically <6-7 m/s from the southerly direction.

   19980514

   Dan Nelson

   No BORCAL.  Completely OVC.

   19980513

   Dan Nelson

   No BORCAL.  Southerly winds in excess of 8 m/s preclude windowless
   HF-ACR stability, raising acceptable error parameters beyond allowable
   limits.

   19980512

   Dan Nelson

   AM BORCAL.  The NWS forecast below appears not to reflect the actual
   local weather conditions.

   19980511

   Dan Nelson

   AM BORCAL attempted, but strong southerly winds are causing significant
   windowless ACR drift.

   The attached NWS zone forecast shows the remainder of the week to be
   questionable for BORCAL.

   AM BORCAL.  No clouds.  Winds intermittent at 0-2 m/s.

   PM BORCAL scrapped to determine the cause of an RCC software problem.
   RCC was improperly applying a window correction factor to the
   windowless HF Absolute Cavity radiometer (30495).  With the problem
   fixed, we can restart BORCAL activities at our next clear opportunity.
   Some question of data validity exists for the period when this problem
   was occurring; essentially all BORCAL 1998-01 up to this point.

       to be completed by the end of next week.
    3. The RCC system and it's associated components and software have
       been calibrated and tested by NREL for the upcoming calibration
       season. This activity was completed on 19980312 by Tom Stoffel,
       Steve Wilcox, Jim Treadwell, and Bev Kay.
    4. It is currently snowing.
