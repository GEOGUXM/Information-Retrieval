                                                      What forces Climate?


   The Earth's climate changes when the amount of energy stored by the
   climate system is varied. The most significant changes occur when the
   global energy balance between incoming energy from the Sun and outgoing
   heat from the Earth is upset. There are a number of natural mechanisms
   that can upset this balance, for example fluctuations in the Earth's
   orbit, variations in ocean circulation and changes in the composition
   of the Earth's atmosphere. In recent times, the latter has been evident
   as a consequence not of natural processes but of man-made pollution,
   through emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. By altering the
   global energy balance, such mechanisms "force" the climate to change.
   Consequently, scientists call them "climate forcing" mechanisms.

                         What is the "Carbon Cycle"?

   The Carbon Cycle is a complex series of processes through which all of
     the carbon atoms in existence rotate. The same carbon atoms in your
      body today have been used in countless other molecules since time
      began. The wood burned just a few decades ago could have produced
     carbon dioxide which through photosynthesis became part of a plant.
   When you eat that plant, the same carbon from the wood which was burnt
   can become part of you. The carbon cycle is the great natural recycler
   of carbon atoms. Unfortunately, the extent of its importance is rarely
    stressed enough. Without the proper functioning of the carbon cycle,
             every aspect of life could be changed dramatically.

                       What is the Greenhouse Effect?

    The Sun, which is the Earth's only external form of heat, emits solar
   radiation mainly in the form of shortwave visible and ultraviolet (UV)
     energy. As this radiation travels toward the Earth, the atmosphere
   absorbs 25% of it, and 25% is reflected by the clouds back into space.
    The remaining radiation travels unimpeded to the Earth and heats its
    surface. The Earth releases a lot of energy it has received from the
    Sun back to space. However, the Earth is much cooler than the Sun, so
    the energy re-emitted from the Earth's surface is much weaker, in the
    form of invisible longwave infrared (IR) radiation, sometimes called
                                    heat.
   Greenhouse gases like water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous
   oxide trap the infrared radiation released by the Earth's surface. The
    atmosphere acts like the glass in a greenhouse, allowing much of the
    shortwave solar radiation to travel through unimpeded, but trapping a
    lot of the longwave heat energy trying to escape back to space. This
   process makes the temperature rise in the atmosphere just as it does in
   the greenhouse. This is the Earth's natural greenhouse effect and keeps
    the Earth 33°C warmer than it would be without an atmosphere, at an
    average 15°C. In contrast, the moon, which has no atmosphere, has an
                   average surface temperature of -18°C.

      What Role does Radiation play in Determining the Earth's Climate?

    Energy or solar radiation enters the atmosphere as sunshine. The sky
   reflects a portion of this radiation, the rest is absorbed by the Earth
    and is eventually released again as thermal radiation. Both man-made
   and naturally occurring events can limit the amount of solar radiation
    at the earth's surface. Urban air pollution, smoke from forest fires,
     and airborne ash resulting from volcanic activity reduce the solar
        resource by increasing the scattering and absorption of solar
   radiation. Some scientists think of the radiation budget in terms of a
   balance. If the Earth gets more energy from the Sun, the Earth heats up
    and emits more thermal energy. This brings the radiation budget into
   balance. If the Earth emits more of this thermal energy than it absorbs
    from solar radiation, the Earth cools off. As it cools off, the Earth
    emits less energy. This change also brings the radiation budget back
                                into balance.
