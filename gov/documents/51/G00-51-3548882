                  ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001
     __________________________________________________________________

                            Strategic Goals 1 - 5
    1. Strategic Goal #1 - For qualified transactions, aggressively match
       financing offers from
        foreign, officially supported competitors.

    1. Strategic Goal #2 - With assistance from other U.S. government
       agencies, negotiate
        international agreements designed to "level the playing field" for
            US exporters. These agreements will neutralize the barriers to
            competitive financing caused by the lack of consensus among
            Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) on the importance of such issues
            as (1) addressing the environmental effects of foreign
            projects and (2) the direction guidelines on large aircraft
            transactions should take. By 2001, Ex-Im Bank, with the US
            Treasury, will negotiate agreements with other ECAs through
            the OECD that will yield common environmental guidelines and,
            by 2004, a new international agreement on aircraft financing.

    1. Strategic Goal #3 - Provide financing support for qualified exports
       for which private market
        financing is not available.

    1. Strategic Goal #4 - Develop techniques and/or programs that will
       maximize Ex-Im Bank's
        support for U.S. exports by leveraging Ex-Im Bank's resources.

    1. Strategic Goal #5 - By FY2006, increase the percentage of U.S.
       exporters aware of Ex-Im
        Bank by 20% (off of the FY2001 base).
