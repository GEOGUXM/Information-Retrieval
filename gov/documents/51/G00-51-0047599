   Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center

GCMRC Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System Services

   Mike Liszewski Program Manager, Information Technology (520) 556-7458

   The GCMRC Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS)
   services intent is to provide a cost-effective means of resource
   monitoring in the Grand Canyon with the desire to reduce impacts while
   expanding monitoring in terms of resource components and geographic
   extent. The GCMRC is currently evaluating different RS methods, and is
   working to increase GIS coverage. The RS methods are evaluated for
   application in the Grand Canyon based on spatial resolution, spectral
   signal to noise ratios, ease of deployment, and proven analytical
   capabilities.  The GIS is used to store the collected data and provide
   modeling capabilities to assist the scientists and managers in
   determining the long-term trends associated with dam operations.

   Current Goals of GIS:

   Objectives to be addressed in FY 2000 include:

     * development of an internet map server
     * development of an ArcView user interface to base data
     * in-house and contractor base data development
     * development of dynamic links within the GIS for easy field
       retrieval of existing canyon control
     * incorporating all FY 99 contributor base data into the GIS.

   Current Goals of RS:

   The GCMRC is in the midst of evaluating the use of black and white,
   color and near-infrared aerial photography along with HYDICE, LIDAR,
   multi-beam hydrographic surveying and other remote sensing platforms to
   analyze and map the physical, biologic and cultural resources of the
   ecosystem.  The GCMRC remote sensing evaluation program will begin in
   FY 2000 and continue for three years.

   Recommended remote sensing technologies to be initiated in FY 1999 are:

     * photogrammetric monitoring of terrace stability of archeological
       sites and sand bar volumes
     * stream-bed classification using QTC-view digital processing system
     * color infrared aerial photography for determining vegetative
       changes
     * multi-beam hydrographic data collection for bathymetric channel
       mapping
     * HYDICE hyperspectral remote sensing data collection for resource
       monitoring
     * LIDAR remotely sensed terrestrial topographic mapping of the canyon
       corridor
     * GPS as a means of extending survey control outside the existing 17
       established GIS sites

   In early FY 99, a LIDAR collected three-dimensional model and DEM of
   the Glen Canyon reach will be completed. The collected images will be
   geo-referenced, ortho-rectified and evaluated for accuracy. In FY 98
   several 1.5 meter HYDICE images were collected. The HYDICE images will
   be evaluated with the intent of developing image-processing techniques
   for automated basedata generation. The derived techniques for each data
   collection method and image processing technique will be used to
   quantify the physical, biological and cultural resources. The resulting
   products will then be assessed for utility in the centerÂ’s monitoring
   program.

   Additonal objectives include:

     * the evaluation of airborne terrestrial mapping technology
     * establishing control in the canyon
     * the literature review and possible evaluation of airborne
       photographic techniques, multi-spectral/hyper-spectral airborne
       sensors and high resolution satellite imagery for resource
       monitoring
     * analysis of existing remotely sensed data sets
     * evaluation of image processing techniques and software
     * the development of remotely sensed data collection protocols

   Selected sensors and mapping techniques will be evaluated over selected
   representative reaches of the Grand Canyon to reduce costs. The sensors
   must be able to answer the questions formulated by the revised
   management objectives. The information gathered will be assessed for
   accuracy and utility. The results of the assessment will enable the
   center to answer key questions about the future use and application of
   the tested images and collection techniques. The images will be
   evaluated for their ability to be used in the analysis and mapping of
   the Grand Canyon. An anticipated result of the initial remote sensing
   and GIS program would be to establish a three to five year rotating
   schedule of data acquisition. However, the frequency and resolution
   necessary for specific resource monitoring in the Colorado River
   corridor has yet to be determined.
