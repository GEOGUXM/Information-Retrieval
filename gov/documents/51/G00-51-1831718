   Press Release
       For Immediate Release
       December 13, 2001

   Russian National Enters into Agreement with the United States on First
                    Digital Millennium Copyright Act Case

   The United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of
   California announced that Dmitry Sklyarov entered into an agreement
   this morning with the United States and admitted his conduct in a
   hearing before U.S. District Judge Whyte in San Jose Federal Court.

   Under the agreement, Mr. Sklyarov agreed to cooperate with the United
   States in its ongoing prosecution of Mr. Sklyarov's former employer,
   Elcomsoft Co., Ltd. Mr. Skylarov will be required to appear at trial
   and testify truthfully, and he will be deposed in the matter. For its
   part, the United States agreed to defer prosecution of Mr. Sklyarov
   until the conclusion of the case against Elcomsoft or for one year,
   whichever is longer. Mr. Sklyarov will be permitted to return to Russia
   in the meantime, but will be subject to the Court's supervision,
   including regularly reporting by telephone to the Pretrial Services
   Department. Mr. Sklyarov will be prohibited from violating any laws
   during the year, including copyright laws. The United States agreed
   that, if Mr. Sklyarov successfully completes the obligations in the
   agreement, it will dismiss the charges pending against him at the end
   of the year or when the case against Elcomsoft is complete.

   Mr. Sklyarov, 27, of Moscow, Russia, was indicted by a federal Grand
   Jury on August 28, 2001. He was charged with one count of conspiracy in
   violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371, and two counts
   of trafficking for gain in technology primarily designed to circumvent
   technology that protects a right of a copyright owner in violation of
   Title 17, United States Code, Section 1201(b)(1)(A), and two counts of
   trafficking for gain in technology marketed for use in circumventing
   technology that protects a right of a copyright owner in violation of
   Title 17, United States Code, Section 1201(b)(1)(A).

   In entering into the agreement with the government, Mr. Sklyarov was
   required to acknowledge his conduct in the offense. In the agreement,
   Mr. Sklyarov made the following admissions, which he also confirmed in
   federal court today:

   "Beginning on a date prior to June 20, 2001, and continuing through
   July 15, 2001, I was employed by the Russian software company,
   Elcomsoft Co. Ltd. (also known as Elcom Ltd.) (hereinafter "Elcomsoft")
   as a computer programmer and cryptanalyst.

   "Prior to June 20, 2001, I was aware Adobe Systems, Inc. ("Adobe") was
   a software company in the United States. I was also aware Adobe was the
   creator of the Adobe Portable Document Format ("PDF"), a computer file
   format for the publication and distribution of electronic documents.
   Prior to June 20, 2001, I knew Adobe distributed a program titled the
   Adobe Acrobat eBook Reader that provided technology for the reading of
   documents in an electronic format on personal computers. Prior to June
   20, 2001, I was aware that documents distributed in the Adobe Acrobat
   eBook Reader format are PDF files and that specifications of PDF allow
   for limiting of certain operations, such as opening, editing, printing,
   or annotating.

   "Prior to June 20, 2001, as a part of my dissertation work and as part
   of my employment with Elcomsoft, I wrote a part of computer program
   titled the Advanced eBook Processor ("AEBPR"). I developed AEBPR as a
   practical application of my research for my dissertation and in order
   to demonstrate weaknesses in protection methods of PDF files. The only
   use of the AEBPR is to create an unprotected copy of an electronic
   document. Once a PDF file is decrypted with the AEBPR, a copy is no
   longer protected by encryption. This is all the AEBPR program does.

   "Prior to June 20, 2001, I believed that ElcomSoft planned to post the
   AEBPR program on the Internet on the company's website
   www.elcomsoft.com. I believed that the company would charge a fee for a
   license for the full version of the AEBPR that would allow access to
   all capabilities of the program.

   "After Adobe released a new version of the Adobe Acrobat eBook Reader
   that prevented the initial version of the AEBPR program from removing
   the limitations or restrictions on an e-book, I wrote software
   revisions for a new version of the AEBPR program. The new version again
   decrypted the e-document to which it was applied. The version of this
   new AEBPR program offered on the Elcomsoft website only decrypted a
   portion of an e-document to which it was applied, unless the user had
   already purchased a fully functional version of the earlier version and
   had both versions installed on the same machine. The new version was
   developed after June 29, 2001. At that time, Elcomsoft had already
   stopped selling the program. The version of this new program offered on
   the Elcomsoft website did not provide a user with an opportunity to
   purchase it or convert it to a fully functional one, and was developed
   as a matter of competition.

   "On July 15, 2001, as part of my employment with Elcomsoft, I attended
   the DEF CON Nine conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. At the conference I
   made a presentation originally intended for the BlackHat conference
   that immediately preceded the DefCon Nine in July 2001 in Las Vegas,
   Nevada. The same group of people organizes both BlackHat and DefCon
   Nine. Since there was no available slot for a presentation at BlackHat
   at the time when the paper was sent for the committee consideration,
   the organizers of both conferences suggested that the paper be
   presented at the DefCon rather than at BlackHat. The paper that I read
   at DefCon is attached as Exhibit A. A principal part of my presentation
   is comprised of my research for the dissertation. In my presentation
   when I said "we", I meant Elcomsoft."

   Mr. Sklyarov's employer, Elcomsoft, remains charged in the case, and
   the Court in that matter has set hearings for various motions on March
   4, 2002, and April 1, 2002.

   The prosecution of Elcomsoft is the result of an investigation by the
   Federal Bureau of Investigation. Scott Frewing and Joseph Sullivan of
   the Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property ("CHIP") Unit are the
   Assistant U.S. Attorneys who are prosecuting the case with the
   assistance of legal technician Lauri Gomez.

   A copy of this press release and key court documents filed in the case
   may also be found on the U.S. Attorney's Office's website at
   www.usdoj.gov/usao/can.

   All press inquiries to the U.S. Attorney's Office should be directed to
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew J. Jacobs at (415)436-7181 or Assistant
   U.S. Attorney Ross Nadel, Chief of the CHIP Unit, in San Jose at
   (408)535-5032.
