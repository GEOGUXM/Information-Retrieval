   SUMMARY: The Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy and

   management activities, is one of the action items in the President's

   final policy has been revised in response to public comments on the
   proposed policy published in the Federal Register on February 22, 2000
   (65 FR 8834).

   DATES: This policy is effective October 18, 2000.
