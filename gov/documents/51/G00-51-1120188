   GPS Overview
   The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite navigation system
   developed and maintained by the U.S. government. Initially designed for
   military applications, civilian users have found numerous applications
   using GPS.
   On March 29, 1996, a Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) was signed
   by President Clinton that described GPS as an international information
   utility. The PDD included the following directives:
   - The U.S. government will continue to operate, maintain and provide
   basic GPS signals worldwide, free of direct user fees.
   - The U.S. will advocate the acceptance of GPS and it's augmentations
   as a standard for use by initiating international discussions and
   agreement with Japan and Europe.
   How GPS Works
   Radio signals are sent from orbiting satellites to earth. GPS receivers
   on the ground can collect and convert the radio signals into position,
   velocity, and time information.
   Some GPS receivers have the ability to store attribute information in
   addition to position information. Examples of attribute information are
   the condition of a street sign, the name of a road, or the condition of
   a fire hydrant. Position and attribute information can be stored in a
   Geographic Information System (GIS) to help users manage their assets
   more efficiently.
