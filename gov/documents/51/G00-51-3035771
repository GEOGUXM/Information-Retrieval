   Community
   The DOEÂ’s Nevada Operations Office shares more than 40 years of history
   with the people of Nevada, Arizona, Utah and California. We realize
   that our ability to demonstrate respect for and appreciation of our
   neighbors will be an increasingly significant factor in continuing to
   contribute to the well-being of the region. Therefore, Nevada is
   initiating several activities intended to form and strengthen mutually
   beneficial relationships, based on trust and respect.

   The Nevada Operations Office also maintains close ties to the:
     * Information Calendar of Events/Meetings
     * Community Advisory Board
     * Nevada Test Site Tours
     * Speakers Bureau
     * Science Bowl
     * Community Environmental Monitoring Program
