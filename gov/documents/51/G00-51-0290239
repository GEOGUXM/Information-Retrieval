   Foreign Service Officer
   The Commercial Service is one of four Official Foreign Affairs Agencies
   under the Foreign Service Act of 1980. The Commercial Service is
   responsible for Commercial Affairs. Foreign Service Officers in the
   Commercial Service work out of foreign and domestic field offices, and
   from our Washington, D.C. headquarters to promote the export of United
   States goods and services and defend United States commercial interests
   abroad. The Commercial Service, through its customized business
   solutions, creates economic prosperity and more and better jobs for all
   Americans.
