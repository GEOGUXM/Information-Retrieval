   containing materials that are loaned to teachers in the region and to
   USGS staff who speak before public gatherings and school groups. The
   collections include maps, posters, models of the earth and dinosaurs,

   Map Collections

   The Denver, Menlo Park and Reston libraries have broad collections of
   maps covering domestic and foreign areas.  The Flagstaff library
   concentrates on maps of the Southwestern United States.  Staff can
   provide information or referral on a variety of cartographic topics.

   USGS Topographic Maps - These maps date from the early 1880's to the
   present.

     Denver - The collection includes current and historic editions of
     topographic maps for all states.

     Flagstaff - Although the emphasis is on current and historic
     editions of 15-minute quadrangles of the Southwestern states, the
     library includes 1:250,000 and 1:100,000 sets for all states.

     Menlo Park - The library has current editions for the Western states
     and historic editions for California only.  Current editions of map
     sets for 1:250,000 and 1:100,000 are available for all states.

     Reston - The collection includes current and historic editions of
     topographic maps for all states.

   USGS Series Maps- Denver, Menlo Park, and Reston have complete sets of
   specialized maps showing the geology, water resources, minerals, and
   other earth science aspects of areas of the United States, foreign
   countries, and outer space.   Flagstaff has nearly complete sets of all
   series.

   Non-USGS Maps - All four libraries have extensive collections of maps
   published by other mapping organizations, both domestic and foreign.
   The maps deal with subjects represented in the book collection.  In
   general, the USGS Library does not collect detailed topographic maps of
   areas outside North America.

   Related Materials - In addition to maps, the USGS Library collects
   atlases, gazetteers, map catalogs, indexes, and other materials related
   to maps and mapping. Contact the library closest to you for more
   information.

   Photographic Library, Denver

   The Photographic Library, located in Denver, Colorado, is an archive of
   still photographs dating from the 1870's and taken by USGS scientists
   as part of their field studies. The works of pioneer photographers W.H.
   Jackson, T.H. O'Sullivan, C. Watkins, J.K. Hillers, T. Moran, A.J.
   Russell, E.O. Beaman, and W. Bell are represented in the collection.
   Topics include portraits of USGS personnel, earth science subjects,
   19th century mining operations, and personnel at work.

   Reproductions (prints, transparencies, and negatives) may be ordered
   from the library at cost. Because the collection consists of more than
   300,000 photographs, researchers are encouraged to visit in person to
   make their selections. Three photo CD-ROM's in the Digital Data Series
   (DDS) provide an overview of the collection and are available for
   purchase as DDS-8, DDS-12, and DDS-21. Topics covered include
   earthquakes, volcanoes, geologic hazards and other phenomena,
   historical mining operations in Colorado and Utah, and earth science
   photographs. For more information, call (303) 236-1010.
