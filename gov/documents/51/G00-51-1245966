   A Close Encounter

   Comets are believed to be the oldest, most primitive bodies in the
   solar system, possibly comprised of some of the basic building blocks
   of life. They contain the remains of materials used in the formation of
   stars and planets, holding volatile, carbon-based rich elements that
   are likely to provide clues about the nature of the building blocks of
   our solar system. Importantly, they may provide evidence that comets
   brought water to the Earth, making possible life.

   With the prospect of comets offering this treasure house of ancient
   information, there is significant anticipation about what findings
   scientists will be able to extrapolate from a firsthand examination of
   cometary materials. Because the Stardust spacecraft will both return
   samples of material from a comet, and provide real time in-flight data
   about what it encounters, there is a real possibility of scientific
   findings that will change the way we view our origins.

   The Stardust spacecraft will fly between about 63 to 93 miles (100 to
   148 km) in front of the nucleus, and through the halo of gases and dust
   at the head of comet Wild 2. During this passage the spacecraft will
   collect dust and volatiles. A volatile is material difficult to capture
   or hold permanently. The comet samples are expected to be made up of
   ancient pre-solar interstellar grains and nebular condensates that were
   incorporated into comets at the birth of the solar system.

   Discovery Missions

   Discovery is an ongoing NASA program offering the scientific community
   opportunities for more frequent, high quality scientific investigations
   using innovative management approaches. It seeks to keep performance
   high and expenses low by using new technologies, costing less than $150
   (FY92$) million to build and are joint efforts with industry, small
   businesses and universities.

   Stardust is the fourth NASA Discovery mission to be chosen to follow
   Mars Pathfinder, Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) and the Lunar
   Prospector.
