   BERNALILLO COUNTY INTERNATIONAL TRADE

      Known as the "Gateway to Latin America," Bernalillo County understands
      the importance of trade with the Americas. From the first Spanish
      colonists trading between New Mexico and Mexico City along the historic
      Camino Real, to present day trade initiatives; Bernalillo County is
      your beginning and ending point. The Bernalillo County Office of
      Economic Development and The Board of Commissioners continue this
      historic path into the 21st Century by aggressively working with
      numerous Latin American countries to expand import and export
      possibilities. The County of Bernalillo will soon become the model for
      international trade between local governments and foreign
      municipalities and governments. Bernalillo County is initiating new and
      unique phases of international trade.
      The Bernalillo County International Trade Model has proven to be unique
      and has set the precedent for other communities to follow. Because of
      its initial success, other communities have expressed an interest in
      emulating our trade techniques. This model is flexible and is used for
      a conglomeration of trade intents and missions. Additionally, its
      components are adaptable to trade with numerous foreign nations,
      states, and municipalities.
