                           NOS Aerial Photography

                      USVI | Hawaii | Order Information

   Color photographs were obtained during March and December 1999, and
   January 2000 for all of the USVI and Puerto Rico from the shoreline to
   water depths of approximately 20 meters (the depth limit of image
   penetration for aerial photos). Many of these photos are now available
   and can be queried, viewed, and downloaded on the internet through a
   searchable archive created by NOS's Biogeography Program called Image
   Finder.

   Aerial photos were acquired at an altitude of ~24,000 ft (9x9 inch
   format, 1:48K scale) for most islands although some areas have
   supplemental imagery at much lower altitudes. Adjacent photos along
   each flightline have ~60% overlap. The altitude and position of each
   photo relative the to the coastline is displayed in Image Finder. Raw
   photography was scanned at 500 dpi and saved as TIFF files. This image
   data was then converted to 500 dpi *.JPG files to accommodate
   distribution over the Internet.

   In addition to these image files, georeferenced mosaics will soon be
   available through Image Finder.
