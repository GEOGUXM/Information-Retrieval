   What are Passive Microwaves?
   AMSU Image

   The Earth radiates energy across the entire spectra of electromagnetic
   radiation (e.g. radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible,
   ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays). Humans are most familiar with
   visible light since oureyes are tuned to the visible spectrum. We are
   also familiar with infrared, such as the radiant heet we feel from a
   fire. Other forms of radiation are important in our everyday lives but
   less intuitive (e.g. radio and microwaves). From a meteorological
   standpoint many of us are familiar with active microwaves (radar).
   Passive microwave energy is less familiar but can be thought of as the
   natural microwave radiation that is emitted by the earth and its
   atmosphere. At selected frequencies, natural passive microwave
   radiation interacts with forms of water (ice, water, and vapor) in our
   atmosphere and on the Earth's surface. When we place a highly sensitive
   passive microwave detector on a satellite we observe those natural
   interactions and can use them to detect rainfall, water vapor, cloud
   water, sea surface temperatures, air temperatures and other hydrologic
   parameters.
   What is the Passive Microwave ESIP?
   TMI Image

   The Passive Microwave Earth Science Information Partner (Passive
   Microwave ESIP) provides science researchers and users with the
   capability to interactively customize and receive hydrologic data sets
   derived from the latest space-based passive microwave instruments.
   These hydrologic data sets are particularly relevant for use in
   atmospheric process studies of the Earth's water cycle (e.g., water
   vapor, precipitation, sea surface temperatures), and regional and
   global climate studies. .
   Earth Science
   TMI Image

   In the last several years, a couple of new Earth-viewing passive
   microwave instruments have been observing our atmosphere and the
   Earth's surface. The TRMM Microwave Imager, launched in November 1997
   onboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, and the
   Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit A & B launched in May 1998 onboard the
   NOAA-15 satellite are providing data sets that are being used to
   monitor the atmosphere and sea surface. These new data sets enable
   scientists to determine the diurnal variability (daily cycle) of
   tropical tropospheric water vapor and cloud water, measure the global
   vertical humidity profile, monitor global temperature variability
   (global warming?), determine tropical sea surface temperatures through
   cloudy and cloud-free conditions, and track the formation of tropical
   cyclones and measure their maximum sustained wind speed.
   Information Science
   TMI Image

   The Passive Microwave ESIP provides web-based access to interactive
   tools that can subset pre-generated data sets, generate new data sets
   on demand from lower-level global or regional data (i.e., level 1 and
   level 2 data), extract coincident data from multiple data sets,
   interactively visualize swath and/or grid data, and convert data
   presentations between a variety of map projections.
   Project Objectives
   AMSU Image

   The objective of Passive Microwave ESIP is to create and provide new
   and improved hydrologic data sets from passive microwave data sets
   through innovative information technology tools and applications. We
   provide science researchers with the capability to interactively
   customize their data sets for use in global climate studies, regional
   assessments, data assimilation modeling, and process studies. Earth
   science data users will benefit from the ability to tailor their data
   sets to their specific needs. Currently, most data sets available from
   Earth science data centers (NASA, NOAA, etc.) are pre-generated with
   regard to spatial, temporal, and geodetic space domains (grid or
   swath). These pre-generated data sets fulfill some but not all broader
   user requirements. They cannot address specific requirements for
   regional studies or data fusion applications. Thus, the ability to
   specify the content and form of the data set will enable more efficient
   use of available computer resources.
   Earth Science Information Partners
   AMSU Image

   The Passive Microwave Earth Science Information Partner (ESIP) provides
   Earth science researchers and users with the capability to
   interactively customize and receive hydrologic data sets for use in
   process studies, and regional and global climate studies. The Passive
   Microwace ESIP is a collaboration between NASA's Marshall Space Flight
   Center, the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and Remote Sensing
   Systems.

   As the name implies, this prototype data center is focused on providing
   space borne passive microwave data sets to the Earth science community.
   The PM-ESIP is initially focusing on a few satellite data sets, such as
   the TRMM Microwave Imager and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit.
   These data sets are important for research in long term natural and
   human induced climate change ("global warming"), seasonal and
   interannual climate variability, regional assessments, and atmospheric
   process studies. Once proof-of-concept is achieved, we will expand to
   include additional Earth science data sets as recommended by our users,
   collaborators and partners.
