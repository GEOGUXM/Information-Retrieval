                            MGF Parser and Examples

   This server contains data and software for the Materials and Geometry
   Format, a least common denominator language for describing scenes and
   objects suitable for physically-based rendering applications (among
   other things).

   The language was developed by Greg Ward of LBL in association with Rob
   Shakespeare of Indiana University, Ian Ashdown of Ledalite Corp. and
   Holly Rushmeier of NIST. It is now at its second official release,
   version 1.1, and we feel that it is ready for prime time. We look
   forward to getting feedback from users, though we are looking forward
   even more to sharing data in this new format.
