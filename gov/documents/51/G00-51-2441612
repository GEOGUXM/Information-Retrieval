     A. CCIPS Role in Economic Espionage Act Prosecutions

     Pursuant to 28 CFR § 0.64-5, for five years after the enactment of
     the EEA, all prosecutions brought under 18 U.S.C. § 1831 and 1832
     must be approved by the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General,
     or Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division.  The
     Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section ("CCIPS") is the
     contact point for facilitating approval of all charges under 18
     U.S.C. § 1832. CCIPS and the Internal Security Section of the
     Department of Justice will work together to facilitate approval of
     all charges under 18 U.S.C. § 1831. In addition, attorneys from
     CCIPS have and will continue to prosecute EEA cases directly in
     appropriate circumstances.
