                               CMOS Update Software

      At The Tone The Time Is... lets you display the time from the U.S.
      Naval Observatory. But it does not let you set your CMOS time clock.

      Time Synchronization Software, however, links you to the National
      Institute of Standards and Technology. Here you will find freeware and
      shareware software for Win 3.x/95/NT/2000/ UNIX/OS2 and the Mac which
      will actually set your CMOS time clock.

      My favorite is NISTIME, which works with WIN 95/98/NT/2000.
