                                   Introduction

      The electromagnetic spectrum is something that is more familiar than
      one might think. The light that our eyes can see is actually part of
      the electromagnetic spectrum. This visible part of the electromagnetic
      spectrum consists of the colors that we see in a rainbow - from reds
      and oranges, through blues and purples. Each of these colors actually
      corresponds to a different wavelength of light.
