   Man carrying box What Exactly is MEP?

   MEP stands for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. We also like to
   say that it's short for, "rolling up our sleeves and diving in."

   MEP is a nationwide network of  not-for-profit Centers in over 400
   locations nationwide, whose sole purpose is to provide small and
   medium-sized manufacturers with the help they need to succeed. The
   Centers, serving all 50 States, and Puerto Rico, are linked together
   through the Department of Commerces National Institute of Standards
   and Technology. That makes it possible for even the smallest firms to
   tap into the expertise of  knowledgeable manufacturing and business
   specialists all over the U.S. These are people who have had experience
   on manufacturing floors and in plant operations. Theyve been where you
   are today. And theyve lived to tell about it! Woman carrying box

   Each Center has the ability to assess where your company stands today,
   to provide technical and business solutions, to help you create
   successful partnerships, and to help you keep learning through seminars
   and training programs.

   It is the special combination of each Centers local expertise and
   their access to national resources that really makes a difference in
   the work we can do for your company. Since weve been out there --
   rolling up our sleeves and working side by side with manufacturers --
   weve assisted more than 107,000 firms. Here are some examples where
   weve helped them and can help you:
