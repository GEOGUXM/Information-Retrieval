                    Grand Banks ERS-1 SAR Wave Validation
     __________________________________________________________________

   Measurements of ocean directional wave spectra, significant wave
   height, and wind speed over the Grand Banks of Newfoundland were made
   using the combined capabilities of the radar ocean wave spectrometer
   (ROWS) and scanning radar altimeter (SRA). The instruments were flown
   aboard the NASA P-3A aircraft in support of the Grand Banks ERS-1
   Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Wave Experiment. The NASA sensors use
   proven techniques, which differ greatly from SAR, for estimating the
   directional long-wave spectrum; thus they provide a unique set of
   measurements for use in evaluating SAR performance. ROWS and SRA data
   are combined with spectra from the SAR aboard the Canadian Centre for
   Remote Sensing (CCRS) CV580 aircraft, the first-generation Canadian
   Spectral Ocean Wave Model (CSOWM) hindcast, and other available in situ
   measurements to assess the ERS-1 SAR's ability to correctly resolve
   wave field components along a 200 to 300 km flight line for four
   separate satellite passes. Given the complex seas present on the Grand
   Banks, the complementary nature of viewing the sea spectrum from the
   perspectives of multiple sensors and a wave prediction model is
   apparent. The data intercomparisons show the ERS-1 SAR to be meeting
   the expected goals for measuring swell, but the data also show evidence
   of this remote sensor's inability to detect the shorter waves traveling
   in the azimuth or along-track direction. Example SAR spectra
   simulations are made using a nonlinear forward transform with ROWS
   measurements as input. Additionally, surface wind and wave height
   estimates made using the ROWS altimeter channel are presented. These
   data demonstrate the utility of operating the system in its new
   combined altimeter and spectrometer configuration.
