          AXIS 200 / AXIS 200+ Camera Server Quick Installation Guide
     __________________________________________________________________

   The AXIS 200+ Camera Server supersedes the AXIS 200 Camera Server. This
   guide covers the installation and basic setup procedures for both
   products. Should you require more detailed instructions, please refer
   to the Camera Server User's Manual available via the Axis WWW Home Page
   at http://www.axis.com/salessupport/manuals.html or
   http://www.se.axis.com/products/documentation/manuals.html

   Familiarize yourself with your version of the camera server. The
   pictures show the front of the AXIS 200+ and AXIS 200, respectively.
   Note that the rear view is the identical for the two products.

Installing the Camera Server

   Follow these instructions to install your camera server:
    1. Record the serial number of your camera server. Please note that
       the serial number is identical to the Ethernet address of the unit.
    2. Connect your camera server to the network using an Ethernet 10baseT
       connector.
    3. Connect the external power supply (Axis type PS-D), to the camera
       server and check that the power indicator is then lit.
    4. Acquire an unused Internet address for your camera server.
    5. Assign the Internet address to your camera server using the method
       approriate for your network environment as detailed below:

   Windows 95, Windows NT

   Start a DOS window and type the following commands:

   arp -s <Internet address> <Ethernet address>
   ping <Internet address>

   Example:

   arp -s 192.168.3.191 00-40-8c-10-00-86
   ping 192.168.3.191

   Note:

   When using the Windows 95 implementation of ARP you must first, if you
   have an empty ARP table (seen with arp -a), ping an existing unit on
   your network before setting the Internet Address of your camera server.

   UNIX

   Type the following commands:

   arp -s <Internet address>> <Ethernet address> temp
   ping <Internet address>

   Example:

   arp -s 192.168.3.191 00:40:8c:10:00:86 temp
   ping 192.168.3.191

    6. Access the camera server by entering the Internet address (URL) of
       your camera into the location field of your browser.
       Example:http://192.168.3.191/
    7. Adjust the focus of your camera by carefully turning the lens.
       Reload your browser to test your adjustments.
          + AXIS 200: A white dot on the lens assembly indicates the
            approximate focus position for the camera, when adjusted to
            the 12 o' clock position.
          + AXIS 200+: The camera server is delivered in approximate focus
            position, with focus set to infinity. If you need to fine
            adjust to close focus, carefully turn the smaller lens. If you
            cannot obtain a sharp picture, loosen the lock ring and bring
            the camera into focus by turning the larger lens. Tighten the
            lock ring afterwards.

   The installation is now complete and pictures taken by the camera may
   now be included into your own applications.

Taking Snapshots

   To trigger a camera snapshot, simply enter the URL of your camera into
   the location field of your Web browser.

   The following picture sizes and respective file references are
   available for snapshots:
     * fullsize.jpg - Full size JPEG snapshot. 352 x 288 pixels, typical
       file size 30 kbytes. Generation time = approx. 0.5 sec
     * halfsize.jpg - Half size JPEG snapshot. 176 x 144 pixels, typical
       file size 15 kbytes. Generation time = approx. 0.3 sec
     * lastshot.jpg - The last snapshot taken by the camera, either a full
       size of half size.
     * hugesize.jpg - The highest resolution snapshot available. 704 x 576
       pixels. As opposed to the `fullsize' and `halfsize' images, this
       type of snapshot is software generated. Generation time = approx.
       18 sec
     * zoom.jpg - Derived from the from the center of `hugesize'. 352 x
       288 pixels. Generation time = approx. 8 sec

   To integrate live snapshot images into your own web pages and
   applications, refer to the target snapshot type as detailed below:

   Example:

   http://192.168.3.191/fullsize.jpg

   Example: (Adding an HTML reference)

   <IMG SRC="http://192.168.3.191/fullsize.jpg" ALT="A fullsize JPEG
   Image">

The CRON Script

   The camera server includes a CRON script service that facilitates
   periodic command execution. It allows you to program event and/or time
   triggered functions within the camera server. From the Camera Server
   Home Page, you can access an on-line editor for generating the CRON
   script file. Alternatively, you can use a common text editor and
   download the file via ftp.

   For example, you can program the camera server to store a new fullsize
   image on an ftp server every 5 minutes.

   The camera server can also be activated by logical transitions on its
   input ports. Thus, by connecting a digital microcircuit to an entrance
   door, the camera server could be triggered to take a snapshot on each
   occasion the door opens and then, for example, send an e-mail with the
   snapshot to an operator.

EyeGet - the JPEG Script

   When using the camera server over the Internet, we recommend that it is
   accessed over an assisting web server and not directly. This is because
   the camera server has limited capacity for handling the extra amount of
   buffering that the Internet may generate. Axis has developed a JPEG
   collector program that periodically collects JPEG snapshots from your
   camera server and writes them to a local file on your web server for
   later retrieval. The program is called EyeGet and is available in both
   Windows and UNIX versions. You can download EyeGet free of charge from
   http://www.axis.com/products/axis_neteye_200/scripts.shtml

Point to Point Protocol (PPP)

   PPP support allows you to use your camera server remotely, just as if
   it were on your local network. Any PPP capable host can be used to dial
   into the camera server.

   Should you wish to use PPP from another host, i.e. Windows NT, UNIX,
   click here.

   PPP configuration for a Windows 95 host

   Follow these instructions to configure PPP from a Windows 95 host:
    1. Connect the remote modem to the serial port of the camera server
       (US Robotics modem recommended).
    2. From the Windows desktop, double-click on the My Computer icon and
       then open Dial-Up Networking.
    3. Double click on Make New Connection. From within this dialog,
       define a <name> that descibes the connection you are creating in
       the `Type name for the computer you are using' field. Select a
       local modem from the displayed modem list.
    4. Click on the configure button to enter the modem Properties page.
       Accept all default settings, but ensure that modem speed is
       compatible with your modem and does not exceed 38,400 bps, which is
       the maximum serial port speed for the camera server.
    5. Click the Connection tab and then click the Advanced button.
          + AXIS 200: Check the Software (XON/XOFF) radio button.
          + AXIS 200+: Check the Hardware (RTS/CTS) radio button.
       Click OK to return to the `Make new connection' dialog.
    6. Enter the relevant phone number information for the remote modem
       connected to your camera server. Click Next.
    7. Click Finish. The system then proceeds to build the Driver
       information database and your connection dialog will then
       subsequently appear in the Dial-Up Networking dialog.

   Accessing the remote camera server

   Follow this procedure to dial out to a remote camera server:
    1. Double click on the newly created icon to establish a modem
       connection for your remote camera server.
    2. Enter your User name and Password an then Click Connect. The status
       dialogs "dialing" and "logging onto the network" are presented
       prior to the display of a Connected to <name> dialog that will
       confirm a successful connection.
    3. You can now access the camera server by entering its Internet
       address (URL) into the location field of your Web browser. Please
       ensure that you are not using a a proxy server (Netscape: Options
       menu\Select Network\Proxies).

   If your Windows 95 computer does not have a dial up networking
   installed, click here.
