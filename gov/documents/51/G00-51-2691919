                 NIH Hosts Pavilion at Black Family Reunion

    NIH will participate in the 16th annual National Black Family Reunion
    Celebration Sept. 8-9 on the grounds of the Washington Monument. The
    National Council of Negro Women celebration is one of the oldest and
   best known gatherings of African American families, and is the largest
   African American gathering in the country, attracting more than 500,000
            people. All are welcome to attend. Admission is free.
   As part of its outreach efforts to address health disparities, NIH has
      reserved a pavilion to educate the public about its commitment to
    conduct and support research that will result in improved health for
    all people. The NIH's logo and name will be prominently displayed on
       signs, and printed in the souvenir activity schedule and other
           promotional materials. The reunion web site address is:
