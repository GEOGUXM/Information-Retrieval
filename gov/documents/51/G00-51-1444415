   NASA's greatest impact comes through working in concert with others,
   which is demonstrated by a reliance on the education community to help
   shape our mission. We also look for the rich and varied perspectives of
   diverse groups of students and researchers to help us improve program
   quality.

   Our main goal is to inspire students and teachers to "reach for the
   stars". We want to encourage a striving for excellence as a way of
   life. Our commitment to these goals is demonstrated by the many ways in
   which the education community is involved in the space exploration
   experience. The inherent drama of human exploration of space provides a
   compelling and engaging context for creating excitement about learning.
