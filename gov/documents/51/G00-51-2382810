Summary

   Allocations of computer time and archival storage are awarded by DOE to
   research groups based on an annual review of proposals submitted
   through the ERCAP process. The allocations are administered by NERSC.
   The research groups are given accounts, known as repositories, from
   which they draw resources throughout the fiscal year.
