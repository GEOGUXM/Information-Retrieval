   Subject: Verification of Coastal Flood and Lakeshore Flood Warnings
   References: Adds Coastal Flood Warnings (CFW) and Lakeshore Flood
   Warnings (LSH) to the National Weather Service (NWS) Verification
   Program (NVP) defined in WSOM C-75.

   1. Collection of Warnings and Verification Data. Coastal Flood Warnings
   (CFW), Lakeshore Flood Warnings (LSH), and verification events shall be
   collected at each coastal and Great Lakes marine WFO (See attachments 1
   and 2). See appendix for procedures.

   2. Verification Events. The following events shall verify the CFW or
   LSH:

   Storm surge (from extratropical systems)

   Seiche

   High astronomical tide

   See appendix Section 1.0 for verification definitions of these events.

   3. Data Consolidation. The CFW and LSH products and verification event
   data shall be forwarded by the WFO to its regional headquarters. Each
   regional headquarters shall provide Weather Service Headquarters (WSH)
   with separate statistical summaries for coastal flood and lakeshore
   flood warnings and events (See attachment 3). WSH shall consolidate
   regional statistical summaries into a national database. WSH shall
   compile statistics each year around April 15 and July 15. WSH shall
   make the statistics available via World Wide Web site, server, or
   electronic mail. CFW and LSH verification procedures shall be similar
   to those for winter storms and high winds as defined in WSOM C-75,
   Appendix B.

   1. Event Verification. Coastal Flood Warning (CFW) and Lakeshore Flood
   Warning (LSH) verification shall apply to all affected zones and all
   zones listed in each CFW and LSH. Verification events shall be taken
   from the WFO's monthly storm data reports. Minor coastal or lakeshore
   flooding, such as "nuisance" flooding, is a non-event for verification
   purposes. Only the three events defined below shall verify the CFW or
   LSH:

   Storm surge. For purposes of CFW and LSH verification, only storm surge
   from extratropical storms shall be considered. A storm surge event
   occurring when a CFW or LSH are in effect shall verify the respective
   CFW or LSH. Any of the following observations constitute a storm surge
   event:

   (1) Water levels equaling or exceeding flood criteria (defined by the
   local office team).

   (2) Significant coastal damage (structural, economic, or
   environmental).

   (3) Moderate to severe beach erosion.

   Seiche. Each participating WFO (attachment 2) local office team shall
   set the criteria for a seiche in its area of responsibility. A seiche
   event (Great Lakes) meeting or exceeding criteria and overlapping in
   time with the LSH, shall verify the LSH.

   High astronomical tide. An extremely high astronomical

   tide, without a storm, can also produce coastal flooding. Use the same
   three observational criteria used in a storm surge event to verify
   coastal flooding from a high astronomical tide.

   2. Lead Time Verification. Lead times for CFW and LSH are computed from
   the time of warning issuance to the time when criteria are first met in
   each zone. Events with no warning at all are considered missed events
   and assigned a lead time of zero.

   If a warning is issued during the two-hour period immediately following
   the time warning criteria are first met, but prior to the end time of
   the event, the warning is verified and the lead time for the event is
   zero.

   Page 3

   If a warning is issued more than two hours after the time warning
   criteria are met but prior to the end of the event, the result is one
   missed event with zero lead time and one verified warning.

   Warnings are often extended in time and/or area. Extensions of warnings
   to new areas are counted as new warnings. Extensions in time for any of
   the zones in the initial warning will not be verified as a separate
   warning.
