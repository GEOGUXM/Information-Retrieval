                                   NOTICE

   A current member may transport firearms on center if, and only if that
   member is going to use the range that day, or transfer the firearm
   using the club's Federal Firearm License that day. Firearms shall be
   carried in the locked trunk of the vehicle, unloaded, in a case and in
   a safe condition. Current club membership cards MUST be carried while
   transporting firearms on center. The club will not tolerate members who
   do not follow these rules. (Members are also responsible for complying
   with all Federal, State and Local laws.)

   If you are not a member of the club, or a security officer on duty, you
   are not permitted to be in possession of firearms on the center.
   Violators are subject to prosecution. If you tell security that you are
   a member of the club and you are not a member, they will find out,
   because they check with us.
