            Simulations of Sodium Guide-Star Adaptive Optics Systems
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lidar measurements based on the resonance fluorescence of sodium atoms
   have for some time been used to infer temperature variations and other
   characteristics of the mesosphere. The "artificial star" produced by
   spontaneous emission from laser-excited mesospheric sodium atoms,
   together with adaptive optics, offers the possibility of nearly
   diffraction-limited imaging of astronomical objects with ground-based
   telescopes (Figure 1). In the first experiments in the 1980's it was
   verified that the backscattered wavefronts corresponded well to those
   from a reference star in the same region of the sky, but the
   high-photon noise implied that more powerful sources of radiation at
   589 nm were required for adaptive optics.

   beacon for adaptive optics.

   Adaptive optics employing the sodium guide star puts puts special power
   and spectral requirements on the drive laser used to excite the sodium
   atoms: the power must be sufficiently great that a substantial number
   of sodium atoms in the mesosphere, of which there are typically only a
   few thousand per cm^3, are excited, and to accomplish this efficiently
   the spectrum of the laser radiation should cover a substantial portion
   of the effective Doppler width (about 3 GHz). In order to realize a
   guide star approximating a point source, moreover, the laser must have
   good beam quality as characterized, for instance, by a Strehl ratio.

   Several groups are actively pursuing the goal of closed-loop
   atmospheric compensation with the sodium guide star. During the past
   year we have collaborated with researchers at the Air Force Starfire
   Optical Range, with the purpose of evaluating various possible laser
   systems to be mounted on their 3 1/2-m telescope under construction.
   Together with a wavefront sensor and an electronically controlled
   deformable mirror, this system is expected to provide high- quality
   ground-based imaging. Our work involves a full density-matrix treatment
   of the 24 states of the sodium D[2] line, including Doppler broadening
   and polarization, temporal, spectral, and spatial characteristics of
   the laser. Propagation through the turbulent atmosphere is treated
   statistically under the assumption that the turbulence is well
   described by the Kolmogorov theory; the latter provides us with an
   analytical expression for refractive-index correlations in a way well
   known in the theory of propagation in turbulent media.

   Of particular interest to the Starfire group has been the variation of
   photon return signals with the peak intensity and spectrum of the laser
   pulse train. (In the scheme under consideration the field from the
   laser is phase-modulated in order to produce a frequency spectrum
   covering a large portion of the sodium absorption profile.) Figure 2
   shows a comparison between our simulations and the one set of
   experimental data points available to us at the present time. The
   simulations involve an adjustable parameter, namely the column density
   of mesospheric sodium, and in Figure 2 we assume the value 5 x 10^9
   cm^-2, which is believed, on the basis of other studies, to be typical
   for the site and time at which the data were taken. We are presently
   extending these simulations in order to suggest an optimal laser pulse
   format for the Starfire system.
