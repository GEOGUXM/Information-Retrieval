                             NPMS SEARCH UTILITY


   Use the form below to search for documents in the NPMS web containing
   specific words or combinations of words. The text search engine will
   display a weighted list of matching documents, with better matches
   shown first. Each list item is a link to a matching document. If
   available, the document title will be shown, otherwise only the
   document filename is displayed. A brief explanation of the query
   language is shown, along with examples.

   Query Language
   The text search engine allows queries to be formed from arbitrary
   Boolean expressions containing the keywords AND, OR, and NOT, and group
   with parentheses. For example,
     * pipeline lng - finds documents containing 'pipeline' or 'lng'
     * pipeline or lng - same as above
     * pipeline and lng - finds documents containing both 'pipeline' and
       'lng'
     * pipeline not lng - finds documents containing 'pipeline' but not
       'lng'
     * (pipeline not lng) and NPMS - finds documents containing 'NPMS',
       plus 'pipeline' but not 'lng'
     * pipeline* - finds documents containing words starting with
       'pipeline'
