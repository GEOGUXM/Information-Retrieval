             Injury Surveillance And Prevention Program (ISAPP)

   DESCRIPTION:

   The Alaska Injury Prevention Program consists of an active network of
   individuals from a broad spectrum of the public and state and federal
   agencies who work to apply education, enforcement and engineering
   efforts to combat the number one killer of Alaskans under age 45.
   In 1995 an Injury Prevention Plan for Alaska was published, intended to
   bring Alaskans up-to-date regarding the injury epidemic. Alaska leads
   the nation in overall unintentional injuries and deaths from injuries.
   The areas of concern are boating and drowning fatalities, fire and
   burns, falls, small aircraft crashes, occupational and child injuries.
   Alaska's suicide rate among young males is over 10 times the national
   average. Even though Alaska has very few roads, in terms of deaths per
   1000 miles driven, vehicle deaths are also above the national average.
   The injury prevention office within Emergency Medical Services is
   charged with coordinating the efforts of the coalition, increasing
   public awareness and actions in behalf of prevention, and encouraging
   interventions statewide in injury prevention and control.

                  Alaska Improves its Child Safety Ranking

      More Injury Prevention Work Needed to Protect Alaska’s Children

    According to a recent study released by the Department of Health and
   Social Services, injuries are the leading cause of death for Alaska’s
   children and adolescents. Beginning at age one, more Alaskan kids die
   of injury than of all other causes combined. For every Alaskan child or
   teen who is fatally injured, about 13 are hospitalized due to a
   non-fatal injury, and many more seek medical help at emergency
   departments, health clinics, and doctor’s offices.
   The Child and Adolescent Injuries in Alaska, 1994-1998 study is
   available in .pdf format by clicking on the icon below.  (2,225 kb -
   very large file) Click here for a copy of the Governor's press release.
