                         Historic Preservation Plan

   The Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation has led the
   development of a statewide Historic Preservation Plan. Completed in
   1995, the plan is designed to guide statewide decisions to protect
   Washington’s heritage. The plan was developed by individuals and
   organizations representing a wide range of interests, both affecting
   and affected by historic preservation efforts.

   The plan is defined by five broad goal statements:

     y Support and strengthen local historic preservation efforts.

     y Enhance historic preservation education and outreach efforts.

     y Form new partnerships to expand the historic preservation
     community.

     y Incorporate cultural resource protection as part of land use
     planning processes.

     y Stimulate economic development and revitalization through historic
     preservation.

   Washington’s State Historic Preservation Plan provides a comprehensive
   outline of policies and strategies for reaching historic preservation
   goals. As a result, preservation resources are now channeled into
   achieving short- and long-term projects with measurable results. The
   plan is also intended to influence policy decisions at all levels of
   government toward protection of the state’s heritage.  Contact Greg
