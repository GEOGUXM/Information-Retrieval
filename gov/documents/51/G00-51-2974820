   Since 1992, the U.S. Geological Survey`s Coastal and Marine Geology
   Program has been conducting studies offshore of New York designed to
   map and characterize the sea floor, to understand the transport and
   fate of sediments and associated pollutants, to map the inner shelf and
   sand deposits along the southern shore of Long Island, and to
   understand the recent geologic history. A long-term goal of these
   geological studies is to develop predictive models and geologic
   information to guide research and sustainable use of the coastal ocean.

   USGS Open-File Report 99-559, Stratigraphic Framework Maps of the
   Nearshore Area of Southern Long Island from Fire Island to Montauk
   Point, New York

   updated 2001-02-02       pages include: Maps icon Publications icon
   The Nearshore Area of Southern Long Island from Fire Island to Montauk
   Point, New York was mapped using high-resolution profiling techniques
   along with surface and vibracore sampling to verify the geophysical
   interpretations. The goal of the investigation is to determine
   regional-scale availability of sand as a resource for beach nourishment
   programs and to investigate the role that inner-shelf morphology and
   geologic framework have in the erosion and morphology of southern Long
   Island. Maps derived from interpretation of the subbottom profiles show
   information on the geometry and distribution of the Quaternary
   sediments and the underlying Coastal Plain unconformity. This
   stratigraphy yields a regional framework on which explanations of
   present (and past) sediment movement, dispersal, and erosion processes
   are based.

   Seafloor Sediment Distribution Off Southern Long Island, New York

   updated 2001-01-30       pages include: Maps icon Publications icon
   The late Holocene evolution of the Fire Island barrier-island is linked
   directly to the geologic framework of the inner-continental shelf.
   Mapping results show that the modern physiography of the
   inner-continental shelf off southern Long Island is an expression of
   antecedent geology and glacial history, as well as oceanographic
   processes acting on the sea floor during Holocene marine transgression.
   The upper surface of the Cretaceous strata provided the foundation for
   deposition of Quaternary sediment and formed the core of a subaerial
   headland off Watch Hill during times of lower sea level. The modern
   sediment deposit was formed from erosion of both the headland areas
   east of Southampton and off Watch Hill and the inner-continental shelf
   during Holocene marine transgression.

   Heavy metals, pesticides, petroleum compounds, and nutrients measured
   in Gulf of Maine sediments originate from a variety of industrial,
   municipal, and domestic sources. A large dataset has been compiled on
   contaminant deposition in coastal sediments in order to quantify the
   research conducted over the last 40 years. The database is to be used
   by the USGS and other environmental managers to assess the
   environmental health of regional ecosystems, the transport paths of
   contaminants, and the ultimate fate of those contaminants. The current
   database is a compilation of organic, inorganic, and texture data,
   sample location information, and comments on the data quality for over
   7,000 sediment samples. This information may be useful to researchers
   for intercomparisons of more recent data as well as policy makers for
   remediation and resource management of urban areas in the U.S.

   updated 2000-08-07       pages include: Educational Materials icon
   Cape Cod is a sandy peninsula built mostly during the ice age and juts
   into the Atlantic Ocean like a crooked arm. Geologists are interested
   in Cape Cod because it was formed, by glaciers, very recently in terms
   of geologic time and because of the ever changing shore as the Cape
   adjusts to the rising sea. This is an online version of USGS geologist
   Robert Oldale's popular circular.
