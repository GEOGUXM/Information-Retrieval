      LIVERMORE, Calif  Two researchers at Lawrence Livermore National
      Laboratory will present preliminary findings today that show the
      association of unique gas flows to rapidly rotating black holes. This
      research is of special interest to organizations like the National
      Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) because it may help explain
      unusual periodic timing properties seen in the X-rays being emitted
      near many suspected black holes.
      P. Chris Fragile and James Wilson, both in the Defense and Nuclear
      Technology Division at LLNL, and Professor Grant Mathews of the
      University of Notre Dame, will present their findings at the American
      Astronomical Society annual meeting in Washington DC from Jan. 7-10.
      Their work has centered around a computer simulation of the way these
      unique gas flows act in the vicinity of black holes. "Much of what the
      NASA Observers look for are X-rays, and the black holes produce a lot
      of that," Fragile said. "Were hoping to simulate a system similar to
      what a NASA Observer might see when it looks at a black hole."
      The work is based in part on Einstein's Theory of General Relativity 
      that is, rotating black holes will "drag" space-time around them, much
      as a tornado funnel cloud would. Any material falling toward the black
      hole will be caught up in this space-time whirlwind as it spirals ever
      closer to the black hole. Fragile, Wilson and Mathews also relied on
      previous research that found that gas falling into a black hole from a
      companion star possesses angular momentum, making it orbit the black
      hole in a disk-like pattern.
      Recent advances in X-ray astronomy, such as the Rossi X-ray Timing
      Explorer (RXTE) and Chandra X-ray Observatory missions, make this a
      particularly fruitful time for theoretical work in this field.
      "Our present work is an attempt to gain a better understanding of the
      motion of gas in the vicinity of rotating black holes through the use
      of extensive computer simulations," Fragile said of the research.
      "Simulations such as ours are critical since these environments are too
      complicated to study by any other means."
      In their previous work, Fragile, Mathews and Wilson have suggested the
      so-called quasi-periodic brightness oscillations (QPOs) seen in the
      X-ray emission of many black-hole candidates may be related to this
      disk-like orbiting. In particular, one black hole in the Galactic X-ray
      source GRO J1655-40 (also called X-ray Nova Scorpii 1994) appears to be
      spinning very rapidly and seems to have an outer disk that is tilted
      relative to the angular momentum of the black hole. The current
      simulations being done are a first attempt to model the complicated
      disk dynamics around this object.
      "Eventually, wed like to simulate something the observers can go out
      and test, but were not there yet," Fragile said. "We think that this
      simulation is the first step toward that."
      This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation
      and the United States Department of Energy.
