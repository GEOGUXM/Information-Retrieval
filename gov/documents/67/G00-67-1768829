   The H-2B nonimmigrant program permits employers to hire foreign workers
   to come to the U.S. and perform temporary nonagricultural work, which
   may be one-time, seasonal, peak load or intermittent. There is a 66,000
   per year limit on the number of foreign workers who may receive H-2B
   status during each INS fiscal year (October through September). The
   process for obtaining H-2B certification is similar to, but less
   extensive and time consuming, than permanent certification.
   In the case of the H-2B certification, the DOL decision is only an
   advisory to INS. The certification request is made by the employer
   using Form ETA 750, and multiple openings of the same job and rate of
   pay may be on the same application. The certification is issued to the
   employer, not the worker, and is not transferable from one employer to
   another or from one worker to another. To allow time for processing
   delays and correction of application errors, the employer should file
   for H-2B at least 60 days but not more than 120 days before the worker
   is needed.
   Qualifying Criteria
     * The job and the employer's need must be one time, seasonal, peak
       load or intermittent;
     * the job must be for less than one year; and
     * there must be no qualified and willing U.S. workers available for
       the job.

   Process for Filing
    1. The prospective employer files a completed Form ETA 750 in
       duplicate to the local State Workforce Agency (SWA) serving the
       area of proposed employment.
    2. The SWA instructs the employer on recruitment requirements,
       appropriateness of the wages and working conditions offered and
       refers qualified candidates to the employer for interviews.
    3. The employer prepares a recruitment report summarizing the results
       of the effort. This recruitment report includes names and addresses
       of applicants and lawful reasons for not hiring the interviewees.
    4. When evaluated, applications for certification shall be forwarded
       by the local SWA to the appropriate regional office.
    5. The DOL regional certifying officer will grant certification if
       he/she finds that qualified persons in the United States are not
       available and that the terms of employment will not adversely
       affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United
       States similarly employed.
    6. The certification or notice of denial thereof is to be used by the
       employer to support its visa petition filed with the district
       director of the INS. To obtain the H-2B work visa, the employer
       uses the INS Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker. The
       Labor Certification Determination and the Form I-129 are submitted
       to the INS along with filing fees.
    7. Because the DOL decision is only an advisory to INS, there is no
       appeal process within the DOL for denial for H-2B applications.
       Such appeals must be filed with the INS.
    8. A candidate outside the U.S. must apply for a visa at the U.S.
       Consulate must provide copies of the above forms to the local INS
       service center.
