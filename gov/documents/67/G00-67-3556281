Supreme Court Takes Action on New Procedures in Death Penalty Cases

   Changes Designed to Increase Recruitment And Appointment of Counsel

   San FranciscoThe California Supreme Court has taken action on two
   proposals designed to enhance the courts procedures relating to payment
   of court-appointed counsel in death penalty appeals and related habeas
   corpus proceedings.

   At a recent administrative conference, the court adopted a new
   procedure on habeas corpus investigative expenses and approved
   distribution for comment of another proposal that changes fixed fee
   payment procedures.

   The Supreme Court welcomes comments on the second proposal by February
   28, 2002, to Mr. Frederick Ohlrich, Clerk of the Supreme Court, 350
   McAllister Street, San Francisco, California 94l02.  Comments may be
   submitted online at http://www.courtinfo.ca.
   gov/invitationstocomment/supctcomments.htm.

   The proposals arose out of the courts ongoing consultations with
   Michael Laurence, Director of the Habeas Corpus Resource Center; Lynne
   Coffin, State Public Defender; and Michael Millman, Director of the
   California Appellate Project.

    For the past two years, court staff and the leaders of the three
   defense entities have met regularly to discuss changes that will assist
   the court in recruiting and appointing additional qualified counsel to
   represent defendants on death row.  The court also has heard directly
   from Laurence, Coffin, and Millman, who at the courts request held
   several focus group sessions last fall with attorneys throughout the
   state to explore issues that may affect counsels willingness and
   ability to seek appointment in such matters.

   Following a comprehensive report by Laurence, Coffin, and Millman on
   their findings from the focus group sessions, the court has undertaken
   a review of its internal procedures and has directed staff to continue
   to work with the three leaders to develop effective responses to the
   concerns expressed at those meetings and in other discussions.

                          FIXED-FEE PAYMENT OPTION

   The two items considered by the court at its recent administrative
   conference are intended to alleviate two concerns raised by defense
   counsel during the focus group sessions.

   First, the present fixed-fee payment option for counsel provides for
   five or six payments to counsel (depending on the scope of the
   appointment) over the course of a case, to be paid at fixed stages in
   the proceedings.  These cases often take considerable time, and several
   counsel pointed to difficulties in managing cash flow because the
   timing of the stages of the proceedings is not always entirely within
   their control, and the spacing of the payments may be too far apart to
   afford financial security.

   Many counsel handling these cases are solo practitioners or practice in
   small firms.  The court reviewed a revision to the payment schedule
   that retains the payment structure but permits advances of portions of
   some of the progress payments upon completion of a specified portion of
   the relevant tasks.

   This option will permit counsel to obtain partial payment at more
   frequent and earlier intervals, and at the same time will assist the
   court in ensuring that counsel are progressing steadily in handling the
   matters to which they are appointed.  The court approved circulation of
   this draft proposal to appointed counsel and to other interested
   persons for their comments.

                           HABEAS CORPUS EXPENSES

   The second proposal responds to the concern expressed by counsel that,
   in view of the limitation on the amount paid for habeas corpus
   investigation expenses (a maximum of $25,000 unless and until an order
   to show cause is issued), the costs of photocopying trial counsels
   files, which is a foundational task for habeas corpus counsel, can
   require counsel to use a disproportionately large part of the allowed
   amount for a ministerial purpose.

   After consultation with the State Public Defender and the Director of
   the California Appellate Project, the court ascertained that the
   photocopying costs for this purpose was typically $1000 to $2000 per
   case.  The court concluded that separate and additional payment for
   this expense is appropriate, and adopted amendments to its policies and
   guidelines to so provide.  The additional payment may be requested in
   all matters in which the habeas corpus petition has not yet been filed.

   Copies of the draft proposal concerning the fixed fee payment schedule
   and the adopted amendments concerning payment for the costs of
   photocopying trial counsels files are attached.

               Actions taken at the California Supreme Courts

                Administrative Conference of January 16, 2002

                                     I.

   Proposed revisions to the Guidelines for Fixed Fee Appointments, on
   Optional Basis, to Automatic Appeals and Related Habeas Corpus
   Proceedings in the California Supreme Court, approved for circulation
   and public comment.

                            5.  Progress Payments

   Until appointed appellate counsel files the appellants opening brief or
   appointed habeas corpus counsel files a petition, a current status
   report must be filed every 60 days.  Other than reimbursement for
   habeas corpus investigative expenses, documentation and itemization of
   hours and expenses by appointed counsel are not required under these
   alternative fixed fee guidelines.

   Counsel appointed for both the direct appeal and habeas
   corpus/executive clemency proceedings will receive progress payments
   after specified stages of representation as follows: (i) one-sixth of
   the fixed amount shortly after counsel is appointed; (ii) one-sixth
   after counsel (a) submits to the assisting entity or counsel (e.g., the
   California Habeas Resource Center, the California Appellate Project, or
   other assisting counsel) detailed, understandable and computerized
   transcript notes, a list of potentially meritorious habeas corpus
   issues, and a draft first request for correction of the record (and, if
   appropriate, any motion for augmentation and/or settled statement), and
   (b) files this first request; (iii) one-sixth after certification of
   the record and filing of the record in this court (one-half of this
   progress payment will be advanced upon request after the trial courts
   order disposing of all pending motions to augment, correct, and settle
   the record on appeal); (iv) one-sixth after counsel [DEL: (a) submits
   to the assisting entity or counsel a draft appellants opening brief,
   and (b) :DEL] (a) files a confidential declaration that he or she has
   made reasonable efforts to consult with defendant and trial counsel
   about potential habeas corpus issues, [DEL: (c) :DEL] (b) submits to
   the assisting entity or counsel a detailed outline of potential habeas
   corpus issues to be investigated, and [DEL: (d) :DEL] (c) files the
   appellants opening brief (one-quarter of this progress payment will be
   advanced upon request after counsels submission to the assisting entity
   or counsel of a final draft of the
   statement of the case and statement of the facts portion of the
   appellants opening brief; one-quarter after submission of a final draft
   of the guilt phase and special circumstance issues portion of the
   appellants opening brief; and one-quarter after submission of  a final
   draft of the penalty phase issues portion of the appellants opening
   brief); (v) one-sixth after counsel (a) submits to the assisting entity
   or counsel a draft reply brief, (b) files a reply brief, and (c) files
   a confidential declaration that counsel has substantially completed the
   habeas corpus investigation (to the extent possible given funding
   provided therefor), and has submitted for review to the assisting
   entity or counsel a draft habeas corpus petition with necessary
   exhibits and declarations (or, in the alternative, that counsel has
   submitted for review to the assisting entity or counsel a draft
   declaration indicating that all potential leads have been substantially
   pursued to the extent possible given funding provided therefor, and
   that it appears that no habeas corpus petition will be filed) (one-half
   of this progress payment will be advanced upon request after the
   following: (a) the Attorney General files the respondents brief, and
   (b) counsel files a confidential declaration that counsel has completed
   approximately one-half of the anticipated habeas corpus investigation,
   and has submitted to the assisting entity or counsel a detailed outline
   of the remainder of the planned investigation); (vi) one-sixth, less
   $10,000, after counsel files a habeas corpus petition in this court on
   behalf of counsels client, and after oral argument and submission of
   the matter on the direct appeal (except that if counsel files no
   petition, counsel must instead file a confidential declaration
   indicating that all potential leads have been pursued to the extent
   possible given funding provided therefor, and that no habeas corpus
   petition will be filed, after which counsel will receive no sixth
   progress payment, except upon a showing that in view of work performed,
   full or partial payment is warranted); and finally (vii) the sum of
   $10,000 after completion of representation in executive clemency
   proceedings before the Governor of California. With each request for
   payment except for those set forth above in (i), (vi), and (vii),
   counsel shall provide to the court a statement from the assisting
   entity or counsel that counsels submission to the entity or counsel
   substantially complies with the conditions set forth for payment.

   Counsel appointed for the direct appeal only will receive progress
   payments after specified stages of representation as follows: (i)
   one-sixth of the fixed amount shortly after counsel is appointed; (ii)
   one-sixth after counsel (a) submits to the assisting entity or counsel
   (e.g., the California Habeas Resource Center, the California Appellate
   Project, or other assisting counsel) detailed, understandable and
   computerized transcript notes, and a draft first request for correction
   of the record (and, if appropriate, any motion for augmentation and/or
   settled statement), and (b) files this first request; (iii) one-sixth
   after certification of the record and filing of the record in this
   court (one-half of this progress payment will be advanced upon request
   after the trial courts order disposing of all pending motions to
   augment, correct, and settle the record on appeal); (iv) one-sixth
   after counsel [DEL: (a) submits to the assisting entity or counsel a
   draft appellants opening brief and, (b) :DEL] files the appellants
   opening brief (one-quarter of this progress payment will be advanced
   upon request after counsels submission to the assisting entity or
   counsel of a final draft of the statement of the case and statement of
   the facts portion of the appellants opening brief; one-quarter after
   submission of a final draft of the guilt phase and special circumstance
   issues portion of the appellants opening brief; and one-quarter after
   submission of a final draft of the penalty phase issues portion of the
   appellants opening brief); (v) one-sixth after counsel (a) submits to
   the assisting entity or counsel a draft of the appellants reply brief,
   and (b) files the reply brief; and (vi) one-sixth after oral argument
   and submission of the matter on the direct appeal.  With each request
   for payment except for those set forth above in (i) and (vi), counsel
   shall provide to the court a statement from the assisting entity or
   counsel that counsels submission to the entity or counsel substantially
   complies with the conditions set forth for payment.

   Counsel whose appointment is limited to habeas corpus/executive
   clemency proceedings will receive progress payments after specified
   stages of representation as follows: (i) one-fifth of the fixed amount
   shortly after counsel is appointed; (ii) one-fifth after counsel files
   a confidential declaration that counsel has reviewed the record on
   appeal and the detailed transcript notes and list of potentially
   meritorious habeas corpus issues provided by appointed counsel on the
   direct appeal, has made reasonable efforts to consult with defendant,
   appellate counsel and trial counsel, and has submitted to the assisting
   entity or counsel (e.g., the California Habeas Resource Center, the
   California Appellate Project, or other assisting counsel) a detailed
   outline of potential habeas corpus issues to be investigated; (iii)
   one-fifth after counsel files a confidential declaration that counsel
   has completed approximately one-half of anticipated habeas corpus
   investigation, and has submitted to the assisting entity or counsel a
   detailed outline of the remainder of the planned investigation; (iv)
   [DEL: one-fifth after counsel files a confidential declaration that
   counsel has completed the habeas corpus investigation to the extent
   possible given the funding provided therefor), and :DEL] one-fifth
   after counsel files a confidential declaration that counsel has
   submitted for review to the assisting entity or counsel a draft habeas
   corpus petition with necessary exhibits and declarations (or, in the
   alternative, that counsel has submitted for review to the assisting
   entity or counsel a draft declaration indicating that all potential
   leads have been pursued to the extent possible given funding provided
   therefor, and that no habeas corpus petition will be filed) (one-half
   of this progress payment will be advanced upon request after counsel
   files a confidential declaration that counsel has completed the habeas
   corpus investigation to the extent possible given the funding provided
   therefor); (v) one-fifth, less $10,000, after counsel files a habeas
   corpus petition in this court on behalf of his or her client (except
   that if counsel files no petition, counsel must instead file a
   confidential declaration indicating that all potential leads have been
   pursued to the extent possible given funding provided therefor, and
   that no habeas corpus petition will be filed, after which counsel will
   receive no fifth progress payment, except upon a showing that in view
   of work performed, full or partial payment is warranted); and finally
   (vi) $10,000 after completion of representation in executive clemency
   proceedings before the Governor of California.  With each request for
   payment except for those set forth above in (i), (v), and (vi), counsel
   shall provide to the court a statement from the assisting entity or
   counsel that counsels submission to the entity or counsel substantially
   complies with the conditions set forth for payment.

   Under limited circumstances (e.g., a delay in the certification of the
   record not due to a lack of diligence on the part of appointed
   counsel), the Court will authorize partial payments before completion
   of the relevant stage(s) of representation.

   In the event the proceedings terminate prior to the completion of all
   of the stages set forth in the progress payment schedule (as a result,
   for example, of the death of the defendant), appointed counsel shall
   memorialize all work completed and the court shall determine and pay an
   appropriate sum to compensate counsel for work performed prior to the
   termination of the proceedings.
