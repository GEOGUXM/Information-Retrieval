   I n f r a red device speeds breast cancer LAB detection; many other
   applications shown TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES ANCER RESEARCH By Nancy C Lovato
   and Mark Whalen The war against breast cancer has a new weapon, thanks
   to an advanced sensor developed at JPL. The device, called the BioScan
   System, was developed by OmniCorder Technologies, Inc., Stony Brook,
   N.Y. OmniCorder received clearance to market the system from the Food
   and Drug Administration last month. Studies have determined that cancer
   cells exude nitric oxide. This causes changes in blood flow in tissue
   surrounding cancer that can be detected by the sensor. The BioScan
   System is sensitive to temperature changes of less than .015 degree
   Celsius (.027 degree Fahrenheit) and "It is a great pleasure has a
   speed of more than 200 frames per second. It causes no discom- to see

   Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector (QWIP), was invented by Dr. Sarath
   Gunapala, a principal engineer for public benefit, of JPL's Device
   Research and Applications Section. The digital sensor detects the
   infrared energy emitted from the body, thus "seeing" the minute
   differences associated with blood flow changes. especially in medicine
   The BioScan System also uses Dynamic Area Telethermometry, invented by
