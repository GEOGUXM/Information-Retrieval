   Over the next 20 years, DOE will retire numerous strategic weapons,
   refurbish the remaining nuclear stockpile, clean up radioactive and
   other hazardous wastes that are the 50-year-old environmental legacy of
   nuclear weapons production, and dispose of the nation's spent nuclear
   fuel.

   These activities must be accomplished in a manner that ensures worker
   safety, speeds waste remediation, and minimizes defects, costs, and
   cycle time in weapons manufacturing.

   Over the past year, DOE has developed a five-year technology roadmap to
   integrate its research and development in robotics and intelligent
   machines (RIM) - systems composed of machines, sensors, computers, and
   software - throughout the DOE complex. In FY 2001, the DOE budget
   request contains funding in the Offices of Defense Programs,
   Environmental Management and Science.

   This funding will carry out the first phase of an integrated research
   agenda. Activities will focus on applied research projects and
   prototype systems development including areas such as: sensor-based
   motion control; glove box automation; precision dexterity research;
   remote characterization of spent nuclear fuel; technologies for
   integration of RIM systems; multi-modal transportation systems; and
   micromanipulation.
