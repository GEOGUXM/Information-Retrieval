     Welcome to CSRC
     Automated Information Security Program Reviews

     CSEAT provides an independent review of an agency's IT security
     program. The CSEAT review, which is not an audit or an inspection,
     begins with an assessment of the maturity of the agency's IT security
     program. This includes the agency's IT security policies, procedures,
     and security controls implementation and integration across all
     business areas. The CSEAT review provides a consistent and comparable
     approach to IT security through consistent application of security
     control objectives and IT security effectiveness criteria. CSEAT
     performs a comparable review of the agency's organizational structure,
     culture, and business mission. After the assessment is performed, the
     CSEAT documents issues identified during the assessment phase and
     provides corrective actions associated with each issue. These
     corrective actions are then provided as a prioritized action plan for
     the agency to use to improve their computer security program.

     The CSEAT does not establish new security requirements. The CSEAT
     security control objectives are abstracted directly from long-standing
     requirements found in federal government regulations, statutes,
     policies, and guidance on security.

     CSEAT Review Report and Action Plan

     The CSEAT review report is organized into nine subsections, each of
     which were derived from a combination of NIST 800-26 Self-Assessment
     Guide for Information Technology Systems as enhanced by other criteria
     from requirements and guidance such as NIST 800-18 Guide for Developing
     Security Plans for Information Technology Systems, OMB Circular A-130
     (Management of Federal Information Resources), and OMB M-01-24
     Reporting Instructions for the Government Information Security Reform
     Act. The critical areas are supplemented by additional evaluation
     criteria derived from a combination of best commercial and governmental
     practices, industry standards, and other regulatory requirements.

     CSEAT review reports provide status and recommendations for improving
     computer security relative to the agency's:
       * Cyber security culture including policies and procedures, and roles
         and responsibilities,
       * System security plans and risk assessment/analysis,
       * IT security personnel, user, and management training and awareness
         programs,
       * Budget and resources dedicated to IT security,
       * IT life cycle methodology and incorporation of IT security,
       * Incident and emergency response,
       * Operations including authorized processing,
       * Physical security, and
       * IT security access controls. [review_area_matrix.gif]

     The resulting action plan is weighted to provide the agency the
     greatest improvements most cost effectively. The corrective actions
     CSEAT identifies include the time frame for implementation and the
     projected resource impact. The action plan can readily be used to
     develop scopes of work for quick "bootstrapping" of the cyber security
     program.
