Public Records Disclosure

   Washington law (RCW 42.17.250-.340) requires that identifiable public
   records be made available promptly to members of the public for
   inspection and copying upon request. Only records that are exempt by
   law may be withheld from disclosure. Allowable exemptions are detailed
   in RCW 42.17.130, 42.17.260, 42.17.255, 42.17.310, 43.21A.160,
   70.94.205, 70.105.170 and 90.52.020. These exemptions are generally
   intended to prevent invasion of privacy and the use of public records
   for personal, commercial or political gain. They include, but are not
   limited to:
     * Information regarding agency personnel, such as social security
       numbers, home phone numbers, home addresses, resum√©s and employment
       applications.
     * Certain investigative records relating to enforcement.
     * Examination test scores.
     * Data, the disclosure or information of which if disclosed could
       result in private gain and/or public loss.
     * Drafts and intra-agency memos that express an opinion, formulate
       policy, or make recommendations.
     * Correspondence between agency staff and the Attorney General's
       Office.
     * Information for use in a political campaign.
     * Information whose release would constitute an invasion of privacy
       as defined in RCW 42.17.255.

   Each Ecology program, executive office and regional office has a
   designated Public Disclosure Coordinator.

To make a request for public records, . . .

   . . . provide a detailed description of the requested records or
   information (subject, dates, location, etc.) to the appropriate Public
   Disclosure Coordinator via mail, phone, fax, or E-mail. The Public
   Records Request Form (PDF format or Microsoft Word format) may be used
   but it is not required.

   Copy fees may be charged.
