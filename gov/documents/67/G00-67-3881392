               Bioinformatics Tools for Comparative Genomics:

                               A short course

   As part of the NHLBI funded PGA programs, the BerkeleyPGA organizes a
   workshop on using bioinformatics tools and databases to study the
   comparative genomics of genes relevant to heart, lung, and blood
   researchers. The first course was held in Berkeley on the UC Campus
   from June 11 - 15, 2001.

   The course covers an introduction into basic sequence analysis tools
   and databases, sceptical usage of annotated genome information, digging
   and finding additional information on your favorite genes, and using
   the computational tools, databases, and technologies developed by the
   PGA program, such as VISTA, a tool for comparative genome analysis,
   CVCGD, a database of cardiovascular genes, SNP genotyping, and
   microarray analysis.

   You will learn the basics in a series of lectures first thing in the
   morning, followed by a testimonial presentation by a biologists using
   these tools. After lunch you will have an opportunity to work in a
   computer lab to hone your skills on examples and even your own favorite
   gene(s).
