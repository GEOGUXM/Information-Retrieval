   As owners of 2/3 of the land base, the Nations farmers and ranchers are
   the primary stewards of our soil and water. They have sustained our
   private land for generations. The value of their careful land
   stewardship extends beyond the fences of farms and ranches. It brings
   the benefits of healthy soil and clean water to people and communities
   throughout the Nation and the world. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
   (USDA) and its partners support them in their stewardship through
   conservation technical assistance, the basic conservation
   infrastructure. All farmers and ranchers can seek technical assistance
   from USDAs Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) through local
   conservation districts. Together, they work to create and put into
   action conservation plans that are designed to improve the quality and
   productivity of their land. [shim.gif]
   Sec. Dan Glickman
   To build upon and strengthen this important relationship that USDA has
       with those who make their living from the land, Secretary Glickman
       has proposed this Conservation Initiative as a key part of the
       overall safety net package. The initiative is based on the
       following four principles:

"Principles I believe in . . .

   [shim.gif]
   [shim.gif]
   Broadening farm policy 1. Broadening farm policy to include more
   farmers and ranchers [shim.gif]
   Non-traditional comodities 2. Farm policy must be national in scope,
   not just geared towards traditional farm commodities [shim.gif]
   valuable land 3. We must treat land and water, not just crops, as
   valuable commodities. [shim.gif]
   Maine Potatoes 4. We need to provide more assistance to those who need
   it most.

   In short, were talking about more producers, more crops, more areas."

   Video clips from the News Conference - February 2, 2000:

   "The President, the Vice President, and I strongly believe that we must
   look at land itself as a valuable commodity, instead of as a tool that
   can be replaced."
     __________________________________________________________________

   "I want to restate this, I feel about this very strongly. . ."
   ". . . Farm programs in the past have been crop commodity related
   almost exclusivelyconservation has been an afterthought in many areas.
   . . The land itselfthe preservation of that resourceis an important
   part of that program, and land itself must be treated as a commodity."

     __________________________________________________________________

   "The conservation portion of the farm safety net is in line with the
   philosophy that economic and environmental considerations can go hand
   in hand."

     __________________________________________________________________

   "The Conservation Security Program will provide annual payments to
   farmers, not on a cost share basis, direct payments to farmers who
   undertake conservation practices that help curb erosion and protect
   water supplies from pesticide and nutrient runoff. The practical effect
   will be to supplement farm income while inducing long-term conservation
   practices. It has a very broad reach--it would make more farmers in
   more areas eligible for conservation payments."

   The Conservation Initiative, totaling nearly $1.3 billion in FY 2001

     * Fund this new Conservation Security Program at $600 million in FY
       2001 and 2002;
     * Increase the Environmental Quality Incentives Program by $125
       million per year;
     * Increase the Wetlands Reserve Program to enroll 250,000 acres per
       year;
     * Increase the Conservation Reserve Program to 40 million cumulative
       acres;
     * Increase bonuses for "continuous sign-ups" under the Conservation
       Reserve Program by $100 to $125 million per year, FY 2000 to 2002;
     * Increase the Farmland Protection Program to $65 million per year;
     * Increase the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program to $50 million per
       year;
     * Provide the necessary USDA technical assistance to implement these
       programs
