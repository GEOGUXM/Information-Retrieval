   The CPA examination is held in May and November. The next exam is
   scheduled for May  8 and 9, 2002.  Exam sites in Washington state are
   Seattle area, Puyallup, and Spokane.  Although applicants are able to
   select a preferred site, applicants are assigned to sites on a first
   come, first served basis.  All proctored candidates will be assigned to
   the Spokane site on a space-available basis.

   For first time applicants, examination application forms and
   instructions are available either on CPAESÂ’ homepage or through calling
   CPAES at 1-800-272-3926. The deadline for applying for the May 2002
   exam is March 1, 2002.

   All re-examination applications are taken over the phone - call CPAES
   at 1-800-272-3926.

   Please note: To ensure fair and equitable treatment of all applicants,
   the Board is strictly adhering to established CPA examination
   deadlines. If you are planning to take the examination, the Board
   strongly recommends timely submission of all required documentation.

   Grade reporting: Effective with the November 1997 CPA examination, exam
   grades between 70 and 74 were reported. Papers with grades of 73 and
   74, and papers with grades falling just below 50 are reviewed a second
   time to verify the accuracy of the grade.

   Candidates with disabilities: Please contact CPAES as early as possible
   if you require some accommodation to take this examination. Candidates
   requesting exam administration modifications must obtain a "Request for
   Modification" form from CPAES.   Candidates must complete and submit
   this form every time that they apply for the examination and need
   special modifications.  The completed Request for Modification form
   must be returned to CPAES with all required documentation by the
   application deadline.

   Grandfather of Current Education: Persons who sat for all parts of the
   CPA exam in May 2000 or earlier only need to satisfy the current
   education requirements. A person does not have to pass any parts, but
   must sit for all parts of the exam. Persons who first sit for the CPA
   exam after July 1, 2000 will be required to satisfy the 150 semester
   hour education rule.

   Conditioning Requirements: To retain conditional credit for passing
   grades, candidates must meet the following minimum requirements:
     * Write all sections not previously passed
     * Pass at least two sections at one sitting (to establish conditional
       credits) or one section (to add to existing credits)
     * Score 50 or more on all sections written, but not passed
     * Pass remaining sections within three years from initial
       conditioning (six consecutive exams).

   Education earned outside the United States:   If you received your
   education from a college or university outside the United States, you
   will need to have your records of academic studies evaluated by a Board
   recognized evaluation service to determine equivalency with Washington
   State requirements.   Please contact one of the Board recognized
   evaluation services.
