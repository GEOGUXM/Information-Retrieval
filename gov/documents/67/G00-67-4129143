   Remainder of Card Catalog Goes Digital -- 4/03/01

   The USGS Library has contracted with Library Systems and Services
   (LSSI) in Germantown, Maryland, to digitize the information on
   approximately 80,000 catalog cards for books in the collection. The new
   electronic records will go into Horizon, the Library's online catalog,
   and will be retrievable by searches on keywords, authors, titles, and
   subjects.

   A recent estimate shows that only half of the Library's resources can
   be found through searching the online catalog. Once we complete this
   digital conversion project in early 2002, we will have taken a major
   step toward our goal of providing users with desktop access to records
   for the entire library collection.

   Telnet Access to Library Catalog -- 11/15/00

   On November 13 and 14, 2000, the USGS Library completed a software
   upgrade to our integrated library system. The new version of the
   software does not provide for a telnet connection to the online
   catalog. It was a strategic decision on the part of the system vendor
   to discontinue telnet access since they are committing resources to
   their Web interface.

   We have removed the telnet link from the library's Internet home page.
   If you have bookmarked the telnet address, please note that it no
   longer works. Our catalog is available on the Web, and a link from the
   home page leads to the search screen of the Web catalog. A link to
   Library Catalog is also included on the navigation bar at the top of
   each library page.
