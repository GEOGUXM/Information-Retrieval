High Energy Astrophysics Observatories

   These Web pages describe all the high energy astronomy observatories,
   or "missions," ever launched. The links to the left are dedicated to
   the most notable past and present X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy
   missions. The pages include
     * a mission overview,
     * technical information on the instrumentation,
     * a bibliography and
     * a gallery of images.

   They also contain a description of the available data if they are
   present in the HEASARC archive. Information on other satellites
   carrying either an X-ray or a gamma-ray telescope is available under
   "Other Resources" in the All Missions pages.

   High energy astrophysics is a young discipline, whose history is only a
   few decades old, and requires space-borne instruments to observe the
   X-ray and gamma-ray sky.

X-ray Observatories

   After the rocket experiments during the 1960s, the first X-ray
   Earth-orbiting explorers were launched in the 1970s (Uhuru, SAS 3,
   Ariel5) followed in late 1970s early 1980s by larger missions (HEAO-1,
   Einstein, EXOSAT, and Ginga). Their scientific outcome, in particular
   the first X-ray images taken by Einstein, lifted X-ray astronomy into
   the mainstream of astronomical research. It is now known that nearly
   every astronomical object from nearby comets to distant quasars emits
   X-rays. In the 1990s the ROSAT survey detected more than 100,000 X-ray
   objects, the ASCA mission made the first sensitive measurements of the
   X-ray spectra from these objects, and RXTE studied their timing
   properties. The next decade with the Chandra, XMM, and ASTRO-E
   observatories (with an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity
   for imaging and spectroscopy), is promising new and exciting
   breakthroughs in the journey of X-ray astronomy exploration.

Gamma-Ray Observatories

   SAS 2 and Cos B, launched in the 1970s, made the first surveys of the
   gamma-ray sky, followed more recently by the Compton Gamma-ray
   Observatory in 1990. Blazars, pulsars, and many unidentified sources in
   our galaxy are the gamma-ray emitters. The mysterious gamma-ray bursts,
   discovered in late 1960s by the Vela satellite, were recently shown to
   be the most powerful explosions in the Universe, thanks to the
   multi-waveband and rapid response capability of the BeppoSAX
   observatory.
