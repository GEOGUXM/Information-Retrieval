   Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)

   New - Ginnie Mae Web-based Quarterly Loan Level Reporting Application

   Based on the successful completion of the EDI pilot program, Ginnie Mae
   is now in the process of implementing EDI with its entire issuer
   community. The participation of each Ginnie Mae issuer (or "trading
   partner") in this initiative is an essential element for the program's
   overall success.

   The principal goals of this initiative are to simplify the reporting
   process for the issuer community and to increase Ginnie Mae's
   responsiveness to the service needs and requirements of its issuers. In
   addition, the EDI program is an essential step in moving toward
   industry-wide reporting requirements, which will "lessen the load" of
   each member of the issuer community.

   Ginnie Mae expects that all participants will benefit from implementing
   EDI for investor reporting. Some of the advantages of exchanging data
   electronically in a standard format include:
     * The ability to submit the same EDI transaction set, utilizing
       agency specific maps to all government trading partners;
     * The ability to receive faster feedback from Ginnie Mae about the
       success of loan processing submissions;
     * The ability to receive information from Ginnie Mae about problems
       with the reported data in time to correct it for the next quarterly
       cycle.

   Specifically, Ginnie Mae is implementing EDI for the quarterly loan
   level investor reporting information, the American National Standards
   Institute's ASC X12 203 transaction set: Secondary Mortgage Market
   Investor Report. This is the standard format used to communicate loan
   level investor reporting information. A Functional Acknowledgment, ASC
   X12 997, will also be sent from Ginnie Mae and will be used to inform
   trading partners of data errors.

   For More Information
   If you have any questions about our EDI program, please e-mail Ginnie
   Mae's EDI Coordinator or call our EDI Hotline at: 1-888-GINNIE4.
