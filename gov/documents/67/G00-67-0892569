     "Our approach - consistent with our values - should be to keep families
     together by providing the services older Californians need to remain in
                                 their own homes, instead of nursing homes."

                                                                  - Governor
                                                                  Gray Davis

                                      Quick Facts about California's Elderly

     FACT SHEET

        California has the fastest growing population in the country, and the
        fastest growing segment of California's population is persons age 85
        and over. The number of people over 60 years of age will grow from 4.9
        million in 2000 to 9.0 million by 2020.

        In January 2000, Governor Gray Davis introduced his Aging with Dignity
        Initiative to expand in-home and community-based care options to assist
        elderly Californians and disabled adults. Included in statewide efforts
        to provide expanded alternatives to nursing homes, Governor Davis'
        Initiative also enhances the quality of care provided in California's
        nursing home facilities.

        In signing the State's budget for fiscal year 2000/01, the Governor
        approved nearly $500 million in total funding (nearly $270.5 in General
        Fund monies) to assist seniors and younger adults with functional
        impairments his Initiative. These funds have been distributed among
        several departments within the California Health and Human Services
        Agency.

        Highlights:

        Helping Seniors and Disabled Adults Live Independent Lives
        The Aging with Dignity initiative builds on existing efforts to help
        seniors and disabled adults remain at home and live independently in
        their own community, including:
          * Long-term care tax credit (AB 2871, Correa): Eligible caregivers
            may now receive a $500 tax credit for families caring for seniors
            and disabled adults at home. This credit will help offset the
            direct cost of long-term care, such as home health visits, adult
            day care, and home safety modifications, as well as indirect costs,
            such as unpaid leave that some caregivers must take.
          * Long-term care innovation grants: One-time challenge grants
            totaling $14.2 million to fund innovative models that provide more
            options to seniors and younger, adults with functional impairments
            in need of long-term care assistance to remain in their own homes
            and communities.
          * Senior Housing Information and Support Center (AB 1846, Lowenthal):
            Provides information concerning housing options and home
            modification alternatives that allow seniors and disabled adults to
            live independently or with their families. This program promotes
            education and training for professionals who work directly with
            seniors and disabled adults to keep them living as independently as
            possible. In addition, the program serves as a clearinghouse for
            information for seniors and disabled adults as well as their
            families on available innovative resources and senior services. The
            budget includes $1 million for these purposes.
          * Senior Wellness Education Campaign: This campaign, funded at $1
            million, offers information to seniors, their families and health
            professionals on healthy aging practices, and information about
            community-based and in-home care alternatives to institutional
            care.
          * Allow low-income seniors and disabled individuals to keep more
            income for at-home care: Reduces out-of-pocket payments many
            seniors have to contribute toward their own medical costs before
            Medi-Cal is available. This extends "no cost" Medi-Cal to about
            13,000 aged and disabled persons with income up to 100 percent of
            the federal poverty level (FPL) and reduces the share of cost for
            those above the FPL. The budget includes a total of $47 million
            ($23.5 million General Fund) for this new program.
          * In-home supportive services increases: Increases wages to in-home
            care providers up to $8.10 per hour and, if revenue targets are
            met, up to $12.10 per hour. Also, extends health benefits to
            in-home care workers for the first time. Total funding for this is
            $354.4 million (including $167 million General Fund).

        Long Term Care Workforce

        The initiative will increase the number of qualified caregivers for
        California seniors and disabled adults by providing job training
        resources for recruitment and training of staff in the long-term care
        industry, instituting a system of quality incentive awards, and
        increasing Medi-Cal rates, as follows:
          * Train Employees to be Caregivers: The budget includes $25 million
            of federal Workforce Investment Act funds to train current or
            prospective employees in the caregiver industries, including
            nursing homes and the In-Home Supportive Services program. The
            Budget also targets Welfare-to-Work funds for recruitment,
            retention, and training of these same caregivers.
          * Increase Nursing Home Employee Wages: In addition to existing
            Medi-Cal cost-based rate adjustments, the Budget includes $67
            million General Fund monies to provide an additional 5 percent wage
            increase for caregivers in nursing facilities, above the 5 percent
            increase provided in the 1999 Budget Act. Total funding for this
            effort is $132 million.
          * Review Staff-to-Patient Ratios for Nursing Homes: The Governor has
            directed the Department of Health Services (DHS) to review minimum
            staff-to-patient ratios in nursing facilities and to make
            recommendations by May 2001.

        Improving Care Facilities

        California is committed to improving the quality of care provided to
        residents in California's nursing homes. The Department of Health
        Services focuses enforcement activities on nursing homes that
        demonstrate difficulty in maintaining compliance with state and federal
        requirements. To further protect the most vulnerable Californians, the
        budget includes several initiatives to increase the number of nursing
        home inspections, ensure rapid response in complaint investigations,
        and strengthen enforcement activities, as follows:
          * Increase Unannounced Inspections of Nursing Homes (AB 1731,
            Shelley): A total of $7.5 million ($3 million General Fund) and 100
            positions have been added to increase the frequency and
            unpredictability of nursing home inspections, and inspect homes
            under new federally mandated standards adopted as part of the
            President Clinton's Nursing Home Initiative.
          * Quality Awards for Exemplary Nursing Homes (AB 1731, Shelley): Cash
            awards are available to facilities that serve high proportions of
            Medi-Cal patients and maintain the highest quality of patient care.
            The budget includes a total of $10 million ($8 million General
            Fund) for this purpose. Facilities will be eligible to receive
            awards of $20,000 to $50,000 each year.
          * Rapid Response to Nursing Home Complaints (AB 1731, Shelley): A
            total of $3.9 million ($2.2 General Fund) and positions have been
            added to help guarantee a 24-hour response in investigating
            emergency complaints regarding patient care.
          * Require facilities to increase posting of the Long Term Care
            Ombudsman's toll-free number (AB 1731, Shelley): All licensed
            facilities are required to increase posting of an 800 number for
            complaints regarding patient safety. The proposal includes
            penalties of $100 per day for noncompliance.
          * Licensure Status for Facilities that have the Most Serious Care
            Problems (AB 1731, Shelley): This allows the Department of Health
            Services to put any facility back on probation for violations of
            standards of care.
          * Increase Fines for Serious or Repeat Violations, and Allow for
            Direct Referral of Severe Violations to District Attorneys for
            Prosecution (AB 1731, Shelley): Increase fines for "AA" citations,
            violations that cause the death of a patient, to $100,000, from the
            previous range of $5,000-$25,000. The initiative also calls for
            increase fines for a first "A" citation, violations that can cause
            serious harm or death or have caused serious harm, from a range of
            $1,000-$10,000 to a range of $2,000-$20,000.
          * Increase the Expenditure Cap on the State Health Facility Citation
            Fund (AB 1731, Shelley): This fund is used for court-appointed
            receiverships, or to replace patient trust accounts or personal
            possessions that are misappropriated or destroyed. Prior to the
            initiative, annual revenue in the fund in excess of $1.0 million is
            transferred to the General Fund. This limit will be increased to
            $10.0 million, thereby allowing a reserve in the fund sufficient to
            handle several receiverships at once.

        Strengthening Fiscal Standards

        Strong financial solvency standards and reporting requirements are
        necessary to ensure that not only the facility operator, but the
        operator's parent company has the necessary resources to provide
        quality long-term care to California's frail and elderly population.
        The Initiative strengthens fiscal standards in the following ways:
          * Establishes a Fiscal Solvency Review Advisory Board to Review and
            Establish New Standards and Reporting Requirements for Nursing
            Facility Licensees (AB 1731, Shelley): The State has a duty to
            protect residents from unnecessary transfers and disruptive
            closures. The budget allocates $500,000 to establish a Fiscal
            Solvency Review Advisory Board to recommend appropriate fiscal
            standards for nursing homes to prevent bankruptcies and disruptions
            in care.
          * Authorizes DHS to Provide for a Temporary Manager (AB 1731,
            Shelley): Under existing law, for homes with severe fiscal
            mismanagement or substandard quality of care, the State has no
            intermediate sanctions or alternatives short of a court-appointed
            receiver. The Initiative makes statutory changes to allow
            appointment of a temporary state manager, paid for by the licensee.
          * Allows DHS to Recover Costs of Court Appointed Receivers from
            Parent Corporations or Individual Owners (AB 1731, Shelley): The
            Initiative expands current law to allow the State to recover the
            cost of a receiver from any substandard licensee or any related
            corporation(s).
