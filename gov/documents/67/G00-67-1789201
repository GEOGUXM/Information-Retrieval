   experience its full value. As with expeditions of any kind, preparation
   is essential. Preparatory requirements are clearly stated in the module
   descriptions. For the best learning experience, be sure students are
   properly prepared before conducting a video conference.

   Please consult our technical requirements for a description of the
   video teleconference equipment needed to participate.
