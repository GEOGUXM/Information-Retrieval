   The Allure of the Sea: Abundance of Life

                              [atscollage.jpg]

   One of the attractions of the Sea is the abundance of life, manifested
   in the hundreds of species of birds that reside in, or visit, this
   important wetland habitat.  The Sea teems with fish.  That is why some
   scientists have called the Salton Sea “California’s crown jewel of
   avian biodiversity” and perhaps the most productive fishery in the
   world.

   [wetlands.JPG] This abundance of wildlife is particularly critical
   given the decline of wetlands.  Over 90 percent of the wetlands of
   California have been lost.  As California’s wetlands decline, the
   importance of the Sea as a habitat for inland wetland species
   increases.  The Sea’s habitats support up to 40 percent of the entire
   US population of the threatened Yuma clapper rail, 80 to 90 percent of
   the American white pelican, and 90 percent of the eared grebe.

    Besides the opportunity for bird watching and for fishing, the Salton
       Sea and its immediate vicinity offer recreational opportunities
      including boating, camping, off-roading, hiking, use of personal
     watercraft and photography.  One of the attractions, the Salton Sea
       State Recreation Area, has 1,400 campsites in five campgrounds,
       hundreds of picnic sites, trails, playgrounds, boat ramps and a
                              visitors' center.

                        The Sea’s Vital Statistics:

    The Salton Sea, located in the southeastern corner of California, is
   actually a lake which occupies a desert basin known as the Salton Sink.
   This body of water covers a surface area of 376 square miles, making it
    larger than Lake Tahoe and Mono Lake.  In fact, the Salton Sea is the
   largest lake in California.  The Sea’s current elevation is about 227
    feet below mean sea level, its maximum depth reaches 51 feet and its
                total volume is about 7.5 million acre-feet.

   The Salton Sea has a unique make-up.  By virtue of its location in the
   Colorado Desert ecosystem, an area with average annual precipitation of
   less than 3 inches per year, the Sea receives minimal inflow from
   rain.

                                                             [inflows.gif]

       As an agricultural drainage reservoir, the Salton Sea serves an
    important purpose for the productive agricultural valleys that adjoin
    it. As an agricultural sump, the Sea consists primarily of commercial
   agricultural drainage.  In fact, 90 percent of the entire inflow to the
    Sea is agricultural runoff from the Imperial, Coachella, and Mexicali
                                  Valleys.

    This inflow carries nutrients, such as phosphates and nitrates, which
   support the rich and abundant life in the Sea.  The inflow also carries
     an abundance of salt (and, thus, the Sea’s name). Currently, the
      salinity level of the Salton Sea is 44 parts per thousand (ppt),
     compared to 280 ppt for Utah’s Great Salt Lake, about 210 ppt for
    Israel’s Dead Sea, 87 ppt for Mono Lake and 35 ppt for the Pacific
                                   Ocean.

                           The Sea’s Challenges

   The very things that make this lake so unique and such a rich source of
   abundant life are placing the Sea’s existence at risk.  The nutrients
     that provide such an abundant source of food for fish are at levels
   that alter the available oxygen in the water.  Its salt content, which
    causes water vessels to be more buoyant, and thus the fastest lake in
    the nation to boat upon, is compromising the reproductive ability of
   fish and, thus, their survival.  Without fish, the hundreds of species
   of birds that rely on fish for food, and the economic status of the Sea
                as a productive fishery, would be threatened.

     Its unique feature of being a closed basin renders it vulnerable to
    increases or reductions in inflows, which can dramatically change its
      elevation.  With increases in inflows, reservation land, seaside
     dwellings and marinas, boat facilities and agricultural fields are
    susceptible to flooding.  The impact of reduction of inflows would be
              an altered shoreline and a reduced surface area.

                         Restoration on the Horizon

   The Salton Sea Authority has recognized the Sea’s challenges and has
    begun the restoration process, to not only sustain the Sea, but also
   revitalize it as an environmental and economic wellspring.  The Salton
   Sea Authority, along with the U.S. Department of Interior’s Bureau of
    Reclamation, has begun efforts to maintain the Sea as an agricultural
      drainage reservoir, restore the wildlife resources and habitats,
     stimulate recreational use, and provide an environment for economic
                                development.
