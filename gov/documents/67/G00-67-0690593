       Vision: A Productive Land in Harmony with a Quality Environment

   The health and resilience of watersheds in South Dakota ultimately
   affects the quality and quantity of surface water in the watershed as
   well as the groundwater recharge of shallow aquifers. In turn, the
   usability of these resources affects the amount of grain and forage
   production, the health and productivity of livestock, the productivity
   of the fish and wildlife populations, the economic vitality of
   producers, and the sustainability of rural communities.

   The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) recognizes the
   private land user as being in a primary position of cropland
   stewardship. Because of their daily contact with the resource,
   producers have the opportunity to observe changes more closely and in
   more detail than anyone else does. Due to the intensity of use,
   cropland as a land resource has a major impact on the quality of the
   soil and water resource in watersheds and aquifers throughout South
   Dakota. NRCS assists farmers in the translation of their observations
   into a management strategy that promotes the long-term health and
   productivity of the cropland resource in an environmentally acceptable
   manner.

              Economic Importance of Cropland for South Dakota

   Agriculture is South Dakota’s leading industry. It has a $17 billion
   impact on the state’s economy. Approximately 16.5 million acres, or 37
   percent, of the land resource in South Dakota is classified as
   cropland. In 1998, the total cash receipts from farm marketing in South
   Dakota were $3.5 billion. From this total, $2 billion was received
   directly from crop sales, with an additional undetermined amount sold
   ultimately through livestock sales. As an agricultural resource,
   cropland has a significant impact on the economic as well as the
   environmental well-being of the State of South Dakota and the Northern
   Great Plains Region.

         The Objective of the NRCS Agronomic Program in South Dakota

   The objective of the NRCS Agronomic Program in South Dakota is to help
   land users apply conservation measures that will maintain the
   sustainability of the cropland resource as well as reduce or eliminate
   offsite environmental impacts to other resources such as South Dakota's
   surface and ground water resources.

   Current Situation

   Economic and Environmental Benefits

   Conservation practices have economic and environmental benefits:

     Improved water regimes;

     Reduced overland water flow;

     Reduced soil loss;

     Reduced sedimentation;

     Cleaner water;

     Increased duration of stream flow;

     Improved quality of the soil resource;

     Enhanced fishery;

     Improved wildlife habitat;

     Increased vigor and productivity of grain and forage crops;

     Improvement in the health and resilience of the soil resource;

     Overall improvement in the quality of life for the people of South
   Dakota and the Great Plains Region.

   Many factors, including ecological, physical, economic, and political
   factors influence the cropland manager’s decisions that in turn affect
   resource condition and treatment alternatives.

   In the last 20 years, a combination of factors such as farm programs,
   commodity prices, fluctuations in prices between various crops, and a
   decrease in the number of operators have increasingly resulted in a
   reduction in the health and productivity of South Dakota's cropland
   resource. Farm profitability has changed agriculture in South Dakota.
   Many agricultural producers today have less diversity in their farming
   operations resulting in rotations that no longer contain legumes, cover
   crops, or manure applications. This economic shift has also lead to
   removal of residue from fields by grazing, haying, and silage. In
   addition, this trend has lead to a greater reliance on tillage and
   chemical methods to control pests and an increase in the number of
   acres of high cash value, low residue crops.

   The trend toward non-diverse crop rotations over a number of years
   results in cropland fields that have a reduced productivity potential
   due to one or more soil degrading processes. Compaction, salinization,
   loss of biological activity, excessive oxidation of organic matter, and
   soil erosion are a few of the soil degrading processes that impact
   South Dakota's cropland resource.

   NRCS has and will continue to work cooperatively with our partnership
   organizations to address the research and education needs in soil
   moisture management, soil quality, rotational diversity, and residue
   management.

   Healthy Soil is Productive Soil – The Health of South Dakota Cropland
                                    Soils

   Soil organic matter greatly influences the chemical and physical
   characteristics of soils and in turn affects crop productivity. Several
   soil characteristics impacted by the amount of organic matter present
   in the soil are aggregate stability, soil tilth, infiltration rate,
   runoff, nutrient holding capacity, and the amount of nitrogen available
   through mineralization. Currently, the majority of cropland in South
   Dakota presently has only 50-60 percent of the soil organic matter
   originally present in the native prairie soils. The rate at which
   organic matter is lost is very dependent on the crop rotation, amount
   of crop residue returned to the soil, amount of rainfall received,
   temperature, soil moisture, and soil management factors such as
   tillage.

   Tillage in crop production promotes organic matter decomposition which
   releases nitrogen for use in crop production. Conventional tillage
   systems in rotations such as wheat-fallow promote this decomposition.
   Wheat-fallow rotations account for two million acres, or 13 percent, of
   the cropland resource in South Dakota. This culture of growing one crop
   in two years, coupled with frequent tillage operations in the fallow
   year to control weeds, decreases soil aggregate size through the
   frequent tillage and stimulates oxidation of the organic matter. As a
   result of this organic matter depletion, soil tilth is degraded so that
   the window of time for proper tillage operations is reduced and in turn
   the planting time for more diverse rotations is limited. This problem
   is especially true for soils derived from Pierre shale as well as other
   soils in the state that have a heavy textured surface. The reduction in
   soil tilth also contributes to other associated problems such as soil
   compaction. At the present time, compaction may result in yield
   reduction on 10-20 percent of the cropland acres in South Dakota. This
   is especially true during periods of abnormally high rainfall. In
   addition, conventional fallow systems often allow water, nitrates, and
   other salts to move below the root zone.

           The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and Soil Quality

   In South Dakota, the CRP has established permanent vegetative cover on
   1.35 million acres and removed from cultivation approximately 800,000
   acres of highly erodible land. During the CRP contract period,
   improvements such as increases in organic matter and biological
   activity have taken place in soil quality. As these acres of CRP return
   to production, organic matter conserving practices will be needed to
   maintain the advances in soil quality.

                   Crop Residue Management in South Dakota

   According to the 1997 National Resources Inventory (NRI), about 18
   percent of South Dakota's cropland resource is eroding at rates greater
   than the established tolerance level "T." Of these acres, five percent
   or 769,000 acres are eroding at rates exceeding 2 times.

   Crop residue management continues to be a major factor in controlling
   soil erosion by wind and water in South Dakota. Since 1989, the acreage
   in all forms of reduced tillage in South Dakota have increased 21
   percent over the total cropland base, or by approximately 2.7 million
   acres. The major shift over this time period has been the no-till
   acreage, which have increased 2.6 million acres. This increase in
   residue management indicates a major shift in crop production methods
   and a substantial reduction in soil erosion. Two out of every three
   acres of cropland in South Dakota use one form or another of residue
   management.

   Crop residue management has substantially reduced erosion; however, if
   other changes are not made along with the reduction in tillage, the
   increased amount of residue can lead to increased problems with pests,
   seeding equipment, poor seedling emergence, and phytotoxicity.

   Research on intensified crop rotations with limited tillage systems in
   the Northern Great Plains has produced cropping systems with increased
   water use efficiency and made possible the growing of additional annual
   crops in the rotations with less fallow. Cropping systems that lengthen
   the wheat-fallow rotation and interject crops such as corn or millet
   into the rotation have resulted in increased grain production over the
   rotation, reduced erosion, increased amount of crop residue returned to
   the soil, and increased the soil organic matter levels in as little as
   four years. Management systems that use more diversity and increased
   cropping intensity, combined with reduced tillage, can significantly
   increase producers annual net incomes as compared to the traditional
   wheat-fallow systems.

   crop rotations with limited tillage systems is available at

                             Nutrient Management

   Nutrient management is vital to meet the fertility requirements of
   crops and reduce the risk of adversely affecting the quality of surface
   and groundwater resources. Accurate assessments of crop nutrient needs
   and knowledge of the nutrient content in commercial fertilizer, animal
   manure, and previous crops (i.e., alfalfa) are essential to a cost
   effective and environmentally sound cropping system. Soil and manure
   tests are necessary to make this determination.

   The nutrients of greatest concern to water quality are nitrogen (N) and
   phosphorus (P). To address these concerns, with an emphasis on manure
   management, NRCS in South Dakota has trained field office staff and
   established an Agricultural Nutrient Management Team (ANMT), based in
   Mitchell, South Dakota. For more information, contact your local NRCS
   field office or the ANMT at: (605) 996-1564, Extension 5, or email
   Merle Kost, Resource Conservationist, at
   merle.kost@sd.usda.gov.

                          Soil Salinity on Cropland

   Soil salinity is a widespread concern in South Dakota and the Northern
   Great Plains. Excessive soil salinity adversely affects crop production
   on approximately 5-15 percent of the irrigated and dryland cropland in
   South Dakota. The development of saline seeps is related to the
   geologic formations: their salt content, structure, and water movement
   properties. Side hill seeps are formed from the lateral flow of water
   through these formations and are affected by crop rotations and
   management systems. Conventional tillage systems such as wheat-fallow
   often allow water and salts to move below the root zone and increase
   the acreage affected by salinization. This process is especially
   prevalent in those years in which greater than normal rainfall also
   occurs.

                         Projections for the Future

   In South Dakota, the technology used in crop production is rapidly
   changing. Over the last 10 years, the amount of fertilizers and
   pesticides used on cropland has increased. This increase in
   agrochemical use serves as an indicator of the advances made in
   technology and the use of additional conservation practices to address
   resource concerns in the state. In addition, these advances also
   substantially impact the way we produce food and fiber in South Dakota,
   as well as the way we protect our natural resources.
