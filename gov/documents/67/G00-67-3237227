   ROXANA WALES CONDUCTS RESEARCH OBSERVATIONS AT JSC MISSION CONTROL FOR
   GEMINI PROJECT
   Roxana Wales spent a week at JSC, observing space station operations in
   the Station Flight Control Room inside the Mission Control Center,
   (MCC). The information will support the Gemini project for the
   Operations Research and Strategic Development Branch of DV3.
   The focus of the project is to understand logging and handover
   procedures as well as information flows and the ways in which various
   software applications inform controllersÂ’ work and decisions for each
   of three different on-board control teams. Gemini will create an
   architecture and a tool that will allow three disciplines to hand off
   to one discipline on weekends and at nights during routine operations
   of the space station.
