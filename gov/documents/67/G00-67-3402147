       the same persons) directs and controls the contribution each entity

   The limits are in effect for Legislative candidates on January 1, 2001;
   for statewide and gubernatorial candidates on November 6, 2002. (Sec.
   83)

   For purposes of the spending limits, "campaign expenditures" has the
   same meaning as "election-related activities" as defined in clauses (i)
   to (vi) and (viii) of section 82015(b)(2)(C).
   A campaign expenditure made by a political party on behalf of a
   candidate is not attributed to these spending limits. (85400c)

   Administrative and civil penalties apply if a candidate who accepts the
   spending limits exceeds them. (85403)
   Acceptance of Spending Limits Not applicable. State candidates must
   file a statement accepting or rejecting the spending limits at the same
   time they file their statement of intention to run for office. (85401a)
   A candidate who declined the voluntary spending limits in the primary
   but did not exceed the limits, may accept them for the general
   election. (85401b)
   Protection Against Self-financed Candidates Not applicable. A candidate
   who has accepted the voluntary spending limits is not bound by the
   limits if an opposing candidate contributes personal funds to his or
   her own campaign in excess of the spending limits. (85402a)

   By regulation, Commission shall require timely notification by state
   candidates of personal contributions to their own campaign. (85402b;
   Regs. 18421.4 and 18542)
   Incentives to Abide by Spending Limits

   Not applicable. Candidates for statewide elective office accepting the
   voluntary spending limits are designated in the ballot pamphlet as
   having done so. Such candidates may purchase space for a statement in
   the state ballot pamphlet. The statement may be up to 250 words and may
   not refer to opponents. The Secretary of State may not include in the
   state ballot pamphlet a statement from a candidate who has not
   voluntarily agreed to the spending limits.

   State Senate and Assembly candidates who accept voluntary expenditure
   limits may purchase space for a statement in the sample ballot. The
   statement may be up to 250 words and may not refer to opponents. Local
   elections officers shall designate in the voter information portion of
   the sample ballot those candidates for Senate and Assembly who
   voluntarily agreed to the spending limits. (85600, 85601)
   Political Party Provisions
   Limits on Contributions to Political Parties No limit. Limit of $25,000
   per calendar year for purpose of making contributions for the support
   or defeat of candidates for elective state office. This contribution
   limit applies to contributions made to a political party used for the
   purpose of making expenditures at the behest of a candidate for
   elective state office for communications to party members related to
   the candidate's candidacy for elective state office.(85303b) No limit
   on contributions to political parties for purposes other than making
   contributions to state candidates. (85303c)
   Limits on Contributions from Political Parties to Candidates No limit.
   No limit. Prop. 34 states that it is designed to strengthen the role of
   political parties in financing political campaigns. (Sec. 1(a)(3),(7))
   Prohibition on Earmarking Act requires disclosure of contributions made
   through intermediaries, but does not have a specific prohibition on
   earmarking. (84302) A person may not make a contribution to a committee
   with the agreement that it will be contributed to any particular
   candidate unless the contribution is fully disclosed under the Act's
   intermediary rules. (85704)
   Membership Communications Payments for communications to members,
   employees, or shareholders of an organization, or their families, for
   purposes of supporting or opposing a candidate or ballot measure, are
   not contributions or expenditures. However, such payments made by a
   political party for communications to its members who are registered
   with that party which would otherwise qualify as contributions or
   expenditures shall be reported under the Act's campaign reporting
   provisions. (85312)
   Fundraising
   Pre-Election Fundraising Not applicable. State candidates may raise
   funds for the general election before the date of the primary.
   Candidates must set aside funds raised for the general election for use
   in that election.

   A candidate who loses in the primary or withdraws from the general must
   refund general election funds to contributors on a pro rata basis, less
   fundraising expenses. (85318)
   Post-Election Fundraising/
   Campaign Debt
   No limit. State candidates may accept contributions after an election
   only to the extent the candidate has debts outstanding from that
   election, and the contribution does not exceed applicable contribution
   limits. (85316) Section 85316 does not apply to a pre-2001 committee of
   a candidate for elective state office established for an election held
   prior to January 1, 2001. (Reg. 18531.6)
   Post-Election Fundraising/Campaign Debt/
   Pre-January 1, 2001 Elections
   No limit. If a state candidate had net debts resulting from an election
   held prior to January 1, 2001, contributions to that candidate for that
   election are not subject to the contribution limits of Sections 85301
   and 85302. (85321)
   Surplus Funds Campaign funds are considered "surplus" for an incumbent
   upon leaving elected office, and for a defeated candidate at the end of
   the first post-election report period following his or her defeat.
   (89519)

   Surplus funds may be used for: payment of outstanding campaign debts;
   pro rata repayment of contributors; donations to nonprofit tax-exempt
   organizations; contributions to a political party or committee (funds
   cannot be used for contributions supporting or opposing candidates);
   contributions to candidates in federal and out-of-state elections; the
   payment of certain professional services for the committee; and
   purchasing a home or office security system if the official has
   received threats. (89519)
   Definition of when funds become "surplus" is the same as current law.

   Repayment of contributions from surplus funds need not be pro rata.
   Surplus funds contributed to a political party committee may not be
   used to support or oppose candidates, but may be used for partisan
   voter registration, get-out-the-vote activities, and slate mailers.
   Special Elections

   For special elections only, the following contribution limits apply:
     * $1,000 for persons;
     * $2,500 for political committees; and
     * $5,000 for broad-based political committees. (85305)

   (Prop. 73's contribution limits were not invalidated as to special
   elections.)
   Prop. 34's contribution limits apply to state special elections and
   special runoff elections. Specials and runoffs are considered separate
   elections for purposes of the contribution and expenditure limits.
   (85314)
   Separate Campaign Accounts See 85318 Candidates for elective state
   office may establish separate campaign contribution accounts for the
   primary and general elections or special primary and special general
   elections.
   Recalls

   No limit. Elected state officers may form a committee to oppose a
   recall measure. Contribution and expenditure limits do not apply to
   recall measures. After the failure of a recall petition, or the recall
   election, remaining funds are treated as surplus. (85315)
   Legal Defense Fund Not applicable. State candidate or officeholder may
   establish a separate legal defense fund account if the candidate or
   officeholder is subject to civil, criminal, or administrative
   proceedings arising directly out of the conduct of an election
   campaign, or the performance of the officer's governmental activities.
   Funds are not subject to contribution limits but must be reported.
   Funds may only be used for attorneys' fees and legal costs, and
   leftover funds must be disposed of under surplus funds rules. (85304)
   Transfers and Carryover
   Transfers from One Candidate to Another No restrictions on transfers of
   funds from one candidate to another, except in special or local
   elections where contribution limits apply. A state candidate or his or
   her committee may make a contribution to another state candidate only
   up to the $3,000 limit of 85301(a). (85305)
   Carryover of Funds Raised Before the Limits Were in Effect Not
   applicable. Existing campaign funds held by Legislative candidates on
   January 1, 2001 (the date the limits take effect for them) may be used
   to seek office without attribution to specific contributors. (85306b)
   Existing campaign funds held by candidates for statewide office on
   November 6, 2002 (the date the limits take effect for them) may be used
   to seek office without attribution to specific
   contributors. (85306c)
   Carryover of Funds When Running for Next Term of the Same State Office
   Not applicable. A candidate for state office may carryover
   contributions raised in connection with one election for state office
   to a subsequent election for the same office without attribution.
   (85317)
   Attribution

   Funds transferred into special elections are required to be attributed
   to specific contributors to stay within the contribution limits of
   85305. A candidate may transfer funds from one controlled committee
   (for local office, for example) to his or her committee for state
   office. The candidate must attribute the transferred contributions to
   specific contributors using a LIFO or FIFO accounting method to ensure
   that the transferred contributions do not exceed state contribution
   limits. (85306a)
   New Disclosure Requirements
   24 Hour Reporting

   Contributions and
   Independent Expenditures of
   $1,000 or More

   Reporting Within 10 Business Days Contributions of $5,000 or More
   Candidates/committees that make or receive contributions or make
   independent expenditures in the late period (16 days before an
   election) must report them on late contribution reports or late
   independent expenditure reports within 24 hours. (84203, 82036, 84204,
   82036.5) Candidates who are required to file electronically with the
   SOS must file late reports electronically.

   State candidates and ballot measure committees that are required to
   file electronically must file within 24 hours electronic reports for
   contributions of $1,000 or more received during the 90 day period
   before an election. (85309(a), (b), 85204)) This section applies to all
   candidates for elective state office as of January 1, 2001.

   Committees, including political party committees, that are required to
   file electronically and that make independent expenditures of $1,000 or
   more during the 90 day period before an election, must disclose the
   independent expenditures electronically within 24 hours of the time
   they are made. (85500a) The independent expenditure reports must
   include itemized information about contributions received since the
   last report filed. (84204b)

   State candidates and ballot measure committees that are required to
   file electronically must file within 10 business days electronic
   reports for contributions of $5,000 or more received outside the
   election cycle. (85309(c), (d)) These requirements apply to all
   candidates for elective state office as of January 1, 2001.
   Issue Advocacy Disclosure None required.

   Disclosure - A person who pays $50,000 or more for a communication that
   clearly identifies a state candidate but does not expressly advocate
   the election or defeat of that candidate, and is disseminated within 45
   days of an election, must file an electronic report with the SOS within
   48 hours of the payment. (85310a)

   The report must disclose any person who has paid $5,000 or more for the
   communication, except those in the business of providing goods and
   services (i.e., consultants and vendors). (85310b; Reg. 18539.2)

   Limit - Any payment received by a person who makes an issue advocacy
   communication is limited to $25,000 per calendar year if the
   communication is made at the behest of the clearly identified
   candidate. (85310c)
   Paid Spokespersons for Ballot Measures Not applicable. A committee that
   makes an expenditure of $5,000 or more to an individual for his/her
   appearance supporting or opposing ballot measures must file a report
   within 10 days of the expenditure specifying certain information. The
   printed or spoken disclaimer must include the statement that the
   spokesperson is being paid by this campaign or its donors. (84511)
   Disclosure in Ballot Measure Advertisements Sender identification
   required on unsolicited mailings of more than 200 pieces. A sponsored
   committee must identify its sponsor. Does not repeal provisions of
   Proposition 208 requiring advertisements for or against a ballot
   measure to identify the top donors. However, Section 84503 requiring
   that advertisements identify contributors who give $50,000 or more to
   ballot measures is not applicable to slate mailers. (Prop. 208
   84501-84510) Current sender identification rules continue to apply.
   Slate Mailer Requirements Among other things, requires slate mailers to
   designate with asterisks those candidates and measures that paid to
   appear in the mailers.

   Also requires a disclaimer concerning the official party position by
   slate mailer organizations about candidates.
   Although Prop. 34 did not repeal Prop. 208 provision requiring slate
   mailers to designate with dollar signs those candidates and measures
   that paid to appear in the mailers (Prop. 208 84305.5), that provision
   of Prop. 208 was declared unconstitutional by the federal court,
   requiring reversion to the pre-Prop. 208 requirement of asterisk
   designations.

   If a SMO or ballot measure committee sends out a slate mailer
   recommending support or opposition of a ballot measure or candidate
   that is different from the official recommendation of the political
   party that the mailer appears to be from, the mailer must contain a
   disclaimer stating "THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL POSITION OF THE (political
   party that the mailer appears to represent) PARTY." (84305.6)
   Other Contribution Requirements - Applicable to All Candidates as of
   January 1, 2001.
   Contributor Information Committees may deposit contributions and use
   "best efforts" to obtain occupation and employer information for
   contributors. Committee shall return, not later than 60 days after
   receipt, any contribution of $100 or more if the committee does not
   have the contributor's name, address, occupation and employer on file.
   A candidate or committee may return a contribution pursuant to
   subdivision (a) after date that candidate or committee has reported the
   contribution under any provision of this title. (85700)
   Return of Contributions State candidate may return all or part of any
   contribution at any time. (85319) This section applies to statewide
   election officers as of January 1, 2001.
   Disgorgement of Laundered Contributions Not applicable. Committee that
   receives a contribution in violation of the Act's prohibition on money
   laundering shall pay the full amount of the contribution to the General
   Fund. (85701)
   Contributions by Spouse or Child Contributions by spouses are not
   aggregated. Contributions by spouses are not aggregated for purposes of
   limits. (85305a) Contributions made by children under 18 are presumed
   to be made by the parent. (85305b)
   Definitions
   "Political Party Committee" Defined in Reg. 18539 (repealed and
   reenacted for other purposes). Defined as the "state central committee
   or county central committee of an organization that meets the
   requirements for recognition as a political party pursuant to section
   5100 of the Elections Code. (85205)
   "Controlled committee" Reg. 18539b states that a political party is not
   a controlled committee (repealed and reenacted for other purposes).
   Codifies current rule that a political party committee is not a
   controlled committee. (82016)
   "Statewide elective office" Defined to include Gov., Lt. Gov., Atty
   General, Insurance Comm'r, Controller, Secretary of State, Treasurer,
   and Supt. of Public Instruction. (82053) Adds State Board of
   Equalization to definition of statewide elective office. (82053)
   "Lobbyist" Any individual who is employed for economic consideration on
   a substantial or regular basis to communicate directly or through
   agents with any state official for the purpose of influencing
   legislative or administrative action. (82039) Does not repeal
   provisions of Proposition 208 defining a lobbyist as any individual who
   receives $2,000 or more in economic consideration in a calendar month
   or whose principal duties as an employee are to communicate directly
   through his or her agents with any state official for the purpose of
   influencing legislative or administrative action. (Prop. 208 82039)
   "Independent Expenditure" Current law defines independent expenditure
   in 82031 and Reg. 18225.7 - made at the behest of. Prop. 34 adds that
   an expenditure will not be considered independent if it is made in
   cooperation, concert, or coordination with the candidate or his or her
   committee or agent, on whose behalf, or for whose benefit the
   expenditure is made. (85500b)

   A controlled committee of a candidate may not make independent
   expenditures and may not contribute to another committee for the
   purpose of making independent expenditures to support or oppose other
   candidates. (85501)
   Miscellaneous
   Enforcement - Administrative Fines Any person who violates any
   provision of the Political Reform Act may be liable in an
   administrative proceeding for an amount up to $2,000 per violation.
   Increases administrative fines for a violation of the Act to $5,000 per
   violation. (83116c)
   Effect on Local Laws Localities may impose additional campaign finance
   requirements if they do not conflict with provisions of the Political
   Reform Act. (81013) Nothing in Prop. 34 nullifies local contribution
   limits or prohibitions, but local limits may not conflict with Prop. 34
   re membership communications. (85703). Prop. 34's contribution and
   spending limits apply only to state candidates, not candidates in local
   jurisdictions. However, other provisions apply to locals, including:
   return of contributions for which information is not on file (85700);
   membership communications (85312); amplified definition of independent
   expenditure (85500b) and 85501; minor changes to surplus funds statute
   (89519); additional disclosure on late independent expenditure reports
   re contributions received and expenditures made since the last report
   filed (84204b); additional slate mailer disclosure (84305.6);
   additional ballot measure advertisement disclosure re paid
   spokespersons (84511) and top donors (Prop 208 84501-84510); increase
   in administrative fines under the Act (91005.5); and disgorgement of
   laundered contributions (85701).
   Effect of Prop. 34 on Prop. 208

   Not applicable. Repeals all of Proposition 208's provisions except:
   82039 - definition of lobbyist
   84305.5 - slate mailer requirements. However, although not repealed,
   this provision was held unconstitutional by the federal court, causing
   a reversion to law in effect prior to Prop. 208.
   84501-84510 - advertisement disclosure requirements (except as to slate
   mailers).
   85802 - appropriation to FPPC
   Effective Date Not applicable. This act shall become operative on
   January 1, 2001. However, Article 3 (commencing with Section 85300),
   except subdivisions (a) and (c) of Section 85309, Section 85319,
   Article 4 (commencing with Section 85400), and Article 6 (commencing
   with Section 85600), of Chapter 5 of Title 9 of the Government Code
