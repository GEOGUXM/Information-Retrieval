      FMCSA Technical Support is operated from the Volpe Transportation
      Systems Center in Cambridge MA .   All FMCSA software systems are
      supported from that location.  The technical support hotline is at
      617-374-5090 and is open from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm EST Monday thru
      Thursday and on Friday from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm EST.    The support
      center also maintains a Technical Support website at
      http://fmcsa-ts.dot.gov.  The various State users also maintain an
      independent user support & comment web site at
      http://www.egroups.com/list/fedsystems .

      FMCSA information system technical support is provided for official
      State and Federal users only.  Non-law enforcement users who obtain
      FOIA versions of the various software packages are referred to the
      internal help & documentation found in the software.

      At present FMCSA provides only one industry specific software package.
      The ProVu carrier profile viewer and analysis package is officially
      available to industry and is supported by the FMCSA Technical Support
      hotline.

   Decorative Red Bullet     Software Training:

      Training for efficient operation of the roadside and investigative
      systems is incorporated within the various National training courses
      provided by FMCSA’s National Training Center (NTC) in Arlington, VA.
      Field Systems does occasionally assist NTC and provides specialized
      training as needed, but NTC is the primary trainer for FMCSA.  For a
      copy of their class schedule contact NTC at:

   Decorative Red Bullet     Freedom of Information (FOIA) Requests:

      While all software developed by Field Systems is readily available to
      the law enforcement community, it’s release to the Motor Carrier
      industry and general public is somewhat controlled to protect
      communication links and prevent creation of bogus reports.  However,
      FOIA versions of the most popular ASPEN and CAPRI software have been
      developed and are available to anyone through the FMCSA FOIA office.
      Requests should be made in writing to:
      Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
      Freedom of Information Office
      Nassiff Building,  Room 4432
      400 7^th Street, S.W.
      Washington, D.C. 20590

      202 366-2960.

      There is a small processing fee for obtaining this software.
