   The White House Conference on Culture and Diplomacy brought together
   diplomats, artists, and scholars for a discussion on how to better
   integrate cultural concerns into the day-to-day conduct of American
   foreign policy and to strengthen cultural exchange programs that serve
   as invaluable forms of international communication . . . . Building on
   a meeting hosted by Secretary Albright last March with diplomats,
   Members of Congress, international leaders of cultural institutions,
   the arts, foundations, multinational companies, and nongovernmental
   organizations, the White House Conference on Culture and Diplomacy
   focused on the intersection of culture and foreign policy, more
   specifically the role of culture in the formulation and conduct of
   foreign policy.
