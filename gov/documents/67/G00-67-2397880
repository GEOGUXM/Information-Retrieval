     * Uniform Offering Circular (UOC):
       The UOC (download PDF format, file size-339KB, uploaded 4/7/00, or
       section by section links at GPO website) sets out the terms and
       conditions for the sale and issue of marketable Treasury bills,
       notes, and bonds. The UOC describes these securities, how they are
       auctioned, including how to submit bids, and the authorized payment
       methods.

       reopenings, which are auctions of additional amounts of previously
       issued securities. The modification provides an optional exclusion
       amount in the calculation. Treasury received comment letters in

Interpretations

     * Fungible Interest Components Stripped from Inflation-Indexed
       Securities:
       Treasury provides interpretive guidance and clarification on the
       regulatory treatment of fungible (i.e., interchangeable) stripped
       interest components of inflation-indexed securities in a letter
       dated November 3, 1998. We urge market participants to read this
       letter in conjunction with the interpretation dated January 17,
       1997, which provided initial guidance and clarification on the
       regulatory treatment of inflation-indexed securities.
     * Deferred Issuance of Treasury Securities:
       Treasury issued an interpretation on January 11, 1996, that states
       that it will not defer delivery of securities awarded in an auction
       beyond the issue date. The interpretation was issued in response to
       several inquiries (download TEXT, file size-7K, file uploaded
