   EASTIN PRAISES SCHOOLS AWARDED SCHOOL SITE EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE BONUSES

               SACRAMENTO-State Superintendent of Public Instruction
     Delaine Eastin announced that the California Department of Education
     (CDE) will post at 12 noon Monday, March 26, the monetary rewards
     that will be given to eligible schools under the School Site
     Employee Performance Bonus program.

               "The talents and dedication of many educators in our
     schools have resulted in dramatic increases in student performance.
     This total team effort is now being rewarded by the Governor's
     awards programs. We have come a long way in a very short time to
     build a solid accountability program," Eastin said.

               "School staffs throughout California have spent long hours
     helping students to perform at their best. In addition to the
     contributions made by teachers and principals, recognition is being
     given to cafeteria workers who serve our children a hot lunch, to
     librarians who instill the love of reading, and to custodians who
     keep our schools clean and safe. Now everyone on a school team will
     share in the rewards of a school's success."

               The Legislature allocated $350 million for this one-time
     program (Senate Bill 1667) that provides financial awards to schools
     and school site staffs in which schools made improvement in their
     Academic Performance Index (API).

               About 67 percent, or roughly 4,500 schools, are eligible
     to receive $1,182.64 per full time equivalent or FTE. Half of the
     allocation, $591.32, will go toward bonuses for school site
     employees, including teachers, administrators and classified
     workers. The remaining half will go to the school sites for
     school-wide use.

               The Senate Bill 1667 program is open to schools that
     qualified for the Governor's Performance Award (Senate Bill 1X of
     1999).

               Complete information will be posted at noon today on the
     CDE Web site: http://www.cde.ca.gov/psaa/awards.
