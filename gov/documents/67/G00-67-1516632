      Handling Misconduct

   PHS DECISION

      The Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH) makes the final PHS decision
      on findings of research misconduct and the imposition of administration
      actions after reviewing the recommendations made by ORI. The ASH may
      accept, modify, or reject the ORI recommendations. The case may be
      returned to ORI for further investigation and analysis. If the ASH
      accepts the recommendations, ORI sends the respondent a copy of the
      final ORI report and a notification letter that describes the proposed
      administrative actions to be taken against the respondent. ORI also
      provides notice of the respondents opportunity to request a hearing
      before the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) on the misconduct finding
      and the administrative actions. The respondent has 30 days from receipt
      of the notification to file a request for a DAB hearing.

      If a hearing is not requested, the research misconduct finding and
      administrative actions become final and are published in the Federal
      Register, the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts, the ORI Newsletter,
      and the ORI Annual Report. In addition, PHS findings and administrative
      actions are posted on the PHS Administrative Action Bulletin Board.
      Debarments are also published in the General Services Administrations
      List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement
      Programs.
