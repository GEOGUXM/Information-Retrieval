                             South Atlantic Area

   The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) performs the in-house research
   for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It is ARS' responsibility to
   develop new knowledge and technology to solve agricultural problems;
   ensure the productivity of high-quality food and agricultural products
   to meet the nutritional needs of U.S. consumers; sustain a viable food
   and agricultural economy; and maintain a quality environment and
   natural resource base.

   ARS is divided into eight areas. The South Atlantic Area (SAA) is
   composed of research facilities located in Florida, Georgia, North
   Carolina, South Carolina, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We
   are the Area Office for the SAA, located in the Richard B. Russell
   Agricultural Research Center in Athens, Georgia. We provide
   administrative, technical and budget coordination for the research
   facilities throughout the Area. Our goal in the Area Office is to
   provide the best administrative and financial services possible to all
   our customers, in particular to our research scientists.
