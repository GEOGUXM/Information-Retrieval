                SHARP: Thermal Protection System Optimization
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Maximizing the conversion of chemical energy (propulsion) to potential
   energy (altitude) during ascent is central to the successful
   development and operation of advanced reuseable launch vehicles
   (RLV's). Atmospheric Assisted Ascent (AAA) technologies improve the
   efficiency of this energy conversion process by turning atmospheric
   liabilities into assets. Of the many AAA technologies currently under
   consideration, the implementation of sharp leading edges on
   hypervelocity vehicles appears to offer the most significant
   improvement in performance. Recently, the Thermal Protection Materials
   and Systems Branch at the NASA Ames Research Center has begun to
   examine the design of thermal protection systems (TPS) for sharp body
   concepts.

   Topics:
     * Atmospheric Assisted Ascent (AAA) Technologies
     * Performance
     * Aerodynamic
     * Propulsion
     * TPS Design for Performance
     * TPS Design for Cost
     * TPS Flight Experiments
          + Focus of TPS Flight Experiments
     * Flight Along the Aerothermal Performance Constraint
     * Evaluation Metrics
     * Flight Metrics
     * Thermal Protection System
     * Ultra-High Temperature Ceramics
          + Ultra-High Temperature Ceramic Leading Edge Component
     * Sharp Body Concept
