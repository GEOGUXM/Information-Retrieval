                                   Ultra-Long Duration Balloon Project

   The Ultra Long Duration Balloon (ULDB) Project is managed by Goddard
   Space Flight Center, 820/Balloon Program Office. The objective of the
   Project is to develop balloon systems capable of supporting scientific
   observations above 99% of the Earth's atmosphere for durations
   approaching 100 days. The TIGER demonstration flight will occur in the
   year 2001. The design goal is to support a scientific payload of 2200
   pounds and to be able to deliver 800 watts of continuous power to the
   scientific instrument based on a 12 hour day and night. The scientist
   will be able to command his instrument and receive science data at his
   home institution via the internet. The telemetry design goal may
   utilize a commercial global satellite network as well as TDRSS. This
   will enable a 50 kbps average downlink with a > 50 kbps in the line of
   sight. The average line-of-sight uplink is 100 bps.
