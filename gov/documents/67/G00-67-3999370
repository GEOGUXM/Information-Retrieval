   "Saving Energy Starts With Me" is a very meaningful statement if it is
   said and put into effect by many people. If I act as an individual, I
   can certainly conserve some energy through my own actions, but if I
   could influence my family, friends or even the whole country to save
   energy, then I could truly make a difference in energy conservation. In
   my eyes, the statement, "Saving Energy Starts With Me" could and will
   be incredibly powerful if I can convince people that Saving Energy
   Starts With We. (Robert attends Kadimah Elementary School)

   Since the 1900's, the use of energy has almost doubled every 20 years.
   Causes of the growth include: (1) population increases, (2) growth of
   the labor force, and (3) products that take large amounts of energy to
   be manufactured. In the last 40 years, the use of energy has increased
   by 90 percent. Saving energy and using it wisely will help it last
   longer. Some ways to save energy are: turning off lights you are not
   using, recycling, and using public transportation. We should all do our
   best to save as much energy as possible. If we do not save energy now,
   the earth's supply could soon run out. (Michael attends Palm Springs
   Elementary School)

   The Chill of fall is in the air. I even feel it inside my home. Br-r-r.
   My eyes focus on the thermostat. I start toward the dial. Wait! I hear
   the chant of the Heat Busters. Bad girl, bad girl, whatcha gonna do?
   Whatcha gonna do when it beckons you? As a Heat Buster I've pledge to:
   * Keep the heat low. * Dress warmly. * Block drafts. * Use cold water
   when possible. * Use hot water wisely. * Close windows and blinds at
   night. * Open blinds during the day to let sun in As a Heat Buster, I
   know Saving Energy Starts With Me. (McKenzie attends LaJara Elementary
   School)

   Yes, Saving Energy Starts With Me. If I pass the word to my parents,
   they will tell everyone else how to save energy. The message is
   spreading because good news travels and spreads. So one day, I started
   turning off lights and recycling. When we got our electric bill, it was
   $100 cheaper than it normally had been. The next day, I told my friends
   this and they said they had been trying to save energy also. I hope
   that the same thing will happen in real life because I want to help
   save energy, too. (Matt attends Oak Woods Intermediate School)

   Wow! It's hot in here! Do you know why? My family is working on saving
   energy so we don't have the air conditioning on. I'm going to open the
   window. Ah, that's better. Speaking of better so is my mom's pocket
   book. It has more cash these days because our energy bills are low.
   Well anyway, I think Saving Energy Starts With Me because I can tell
   all my friends how much pollution energy makes when it's used. From
   those gurgling energy waster cars and lights and so much more, I could
   make a big difference in the world. (Marie attends Richmond Elementary
   School)

   Energy saving starts with me because I waste a lot of energy, but some
   people waste it more than I do. So I thought of a way to help us all. I
   want to start an "Energy Watch" in my community. We can go door-to-door
   twice a week looking for wasted energy. I will display posters on
   telephone poles, youth centers, stores and other buildings. Neighbors
   could become "Energy Buddies" and check on each other by calling and
   reminding them to conserve energy. Energy Watch will hopefully become a
   chain reaction that really started with me. (Jia attends Patterson
   Elementary School)

   So many people today use energy instead of human power. Then, they buy
   exercise equipment because they are out of shape. Isn't that weird?
   There are so many ways we can use body power instead of resources. Here
   are a few ... * Walk or bike to nearby places instead of riding in the
   car. * Walk up or down the stairway instead of taking the elevator. *
   Lift up the garage door manually instead of with electric openers. *
   Sweep your driveway instead of using the blower. When you use human
   power, you save the time, money and energy you would have spent
   exercising. (Jackie attends Trinity Lutheran School)

   I think that I should save energy by not using too much paper and using
   E-mail and trying to walk more. I think we should be more careful about
   pollution. I am kind of worried about pollution. I want to grow up in a
   clean atmosphere. I am going to get an E-bike. I will ride that and
   recharge it where I go while I am there. I think we should use solar
   power, hydroelectric, wind, geothermal, and biomass; it would help not
   pollute. We should turn off lights and faucets. It would make a
   difference. Use less energy please. (Clay attends Bellevue Santa-Fe
   Charter School)

   With 700 plus students at our school, my idea is each day some of the
   kids could peddle a bike which is used to charge batteries-like a power
   source to run different things in our classrooms, maybe for a fish
   tank, or water fountain, or the computers, cold or heat in the rooms.
   And the bonus for helping out that day would be a slushy or ice cream
   treat that the bike is powered to. School is maybe seven hours long.
   That is 420 minutes, so if 210 kids each peddled for two minutes today,
   the job is done. (Christina attends Keswick Christian School)

   Caution! Our energy is running out. I will describe ways I save energy.
   I use solar panels instead of electricity. I walk to places so I don't
   pollute our air. I plan my trips so I don't pollute. I use fans instead
   of heat/air conditioning. Instead of watching TV, I go out and play. I
   use a carpool to conserve gasoline. I turn out my lights when I am not
   using them. I hope that you listen to me. Let's be smart and turn out
   our lights. Let's do these things together because energy does not last
   forever. (Aaron attends Caldwell Academy)

   When I leave the room, I make sure it's not so bright by always turning
   off the light. Instead of using a car, I ride my bike or take a hike.
   When I'm bored, I don't go on the Internet; instead, I play a board
   game with a new friend I've met. While I am doing my homework at night,
   I only use one light. When going on trips like to the store, I do
   several errands to save even more. I know I am small, but when it comes
   to saving energy, I am really tall! (Sara is schooled at home)
