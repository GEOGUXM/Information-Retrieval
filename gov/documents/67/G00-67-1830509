  Safety Analysis, Hazards, and Risk Evaluation Expertise

   Reactor Engineering Division personnel have considerable experience in
   the field of deterministic and probabilistic safety analysis. In
   deterministic analyses, facilities and systems are analyzed to show
   that operating conditions will remain within design tolerances. In
   probabilistic studies, hazards and risk evaluation models are used to
   show, either qualitatively or quantitatively, which elements are most
   likely to contribute to failure of a system or facility, and to
   indicate corresponding design improvements.

   This field covers a wide range of disciplines, usually requiring
   expertise in a number of areas (heat transfer, structural mechanics,
   materials properties, etc.) as well as familiarity with formal hazards
   and risk evaluation methods. Because of their extensive experience in
   many engineering disciplines, RE Division personnel are highly
   qualified to conduct the type of in-depth hazards and risk evaluations
   that are necessary for modern facilities to compete in today's highly
   regulated environment.

Areas of Application and Evaluation Methods

   The following methods have been combined into state-of-the-art computer
   code packages which can be integrated with systems and components
   reliability databases to form a powerful tool for both qualitative and
   quantitative safety analyses, and hazards and risk evaluations.

     * Seismic analysis
     * Steam explosion studies
     * Radionuclide and hazardous chemical disposition methods
     * Thermal-hydraulic analysis
     * Fault tree analysis
     * Event tree analysis
     * Preliminary Hazards Analysis (PHA)
     * Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
     * Hazards and Operability (HazOp) studies
     * Human error analysis
     * Common cause failure analysis
