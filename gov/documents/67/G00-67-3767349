   Fossil Energy Program
                        Sandia National Laboratories

   Welcome to Sandia National Laboratories' Fossil Energy Program
   homepage. Since the late 1970s, this program has developed and
   transferred Sandia technologies to assist the natural gas and oil
   industry, especially U.S. independent producers. Our goal is to
   maintain a secure, economic supply of the nation's natural gas and
   crude oil. To this end, we develop improved recovery and processing
   technology using our expertise in geoscience, advanced diagnostics and
   imaging, drilling technology, materials and process science, advanced
   storage systems, and combustion science. For more information, please
   call or e-mail any of our contacts.

   Program influences on the domestic oil and gas industry include:
     * Reduced well failure rate at Belridge, CA, oil field from 10% to 5%
       per year, resulting in an annual savings to operators of $25 to $50
       million in lost production.
     * Automatic Casing Swab yielded $2 million in federal tax revenue and
       $10 million in reserves to a West Virginia operator.
     * Salvo seismic imaging algorithm development wins 1999 R&D 100
       Award.

   Thrust Areas

   The program capitalizes on Sandia's unique experience with research and
   development in five Thrust Areas:
     * Well Construction
     * Reservoir Evaluation & Production
     * Storage & Transmission
     * Fuel Utilization
     * Environmental

   Capabilities

   Eight centers within Sandia support the Fossil Energy Program. Two
   centers are responsible for program management. All eight support
   research and development. We have mapped the capabilities of each of
   the participating centers to the five Thrust Areas. Most of the centers
   also have their own home pages.
