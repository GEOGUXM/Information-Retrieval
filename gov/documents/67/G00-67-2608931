   In order to determine the structural properties of defects on
   semiconductor surfaces using STM, it is crucial to properly interpret
   the STM images using, for example, state-of-art first principles
   calculations. The case considered here in the above figures (click on
   small figures above to see full-size versions) is As vacancies on the
   GaAs(110) surface. STM images were generated using ab-initio
   wavefunctions and supercells, which probe the isosurface of the
   wavefunctions squared over a given energy window. The two figures here
   were calculated with a negative sample bias of about 2 eV to reveal
   states associated with surface As atoms. They show, on the appearance,
   that surface As atoms near the vacancy are displaced towards the
   underlying bulk. In calculations with large enough surface supercells
   (see the 2nd figure), significant As displacements in the STM images
   due to As vacancy were found while in fact the vacancy causes little As
   atomic motion. Discrepancies between the actual atomic positions and
   those inferred from the STM images for Ga atoms are even more
   pronounced. A detailed analysis explaining this paradox is the subject
   of the reference below.
