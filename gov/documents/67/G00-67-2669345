                Project Information, Development, and Status

                              From the Director

   The Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL), and its antecedent, The Program
   for Regional Observing and Forecasting Services (PROFS), have been
   building weather information systems for use by operational
   meteorologists since 1980. It became evident early on that the
   combination of user requirements and system capabilities for optimal
   operations could not be determined a priori. The only method that works
   is to build a system, then have it used by meteorologists (including as
   many operational weather forecasters as possible) and then build a new
   or improved version based on actual experience. This "rapid
   prototyping" approach was used in PROFS long before the term itself
   became popular. PROFS had real-time exercises through the early 1980's,
   leading to the best possible real-time exercise - the operational DARE
   system, which was implemented at the Denver and Norman Weather Service
   Forecast Offices.
   By the early 1990's, the technology - hardware, software, and
   networking, allowed for designing and implementing a much more powerful
   hydrometeorological information system. Using the hardware and basic
   design concepts from the AWIPS contractor, PRC, FSL once again used
   "rapid prototyping" to build its WFO-Advanced system. The major
   exercise in this process was the WFO-Advanced Real-Time Forecast
   Exercise: RT95. In this exercise, NWS forecasters from around the
   country were brought in to use the system. A realistic operational
   environment was simulated. Over 1000 pages of comments were compiled
   and discussed.
   The purpose of an in-depth hard hitting evaluation like RT95 is to
   learn enough to improve the system in all areas. The Lab's Evaluation
   Team was encouraged to be "tough", to provide the kind of feedback that
   can be the basis for a much improved next version. In the case of the
   WFO-Advanced system, the RT95 system was completed in September of
   1995, and the results have been the basis for an intensive development
   since that time, leading up to the first operational version to be
   installed at the Denver WSFO in May 1996. In our opinion, this approach
   has worked. Every area identified as substandard, or even as merely
   adequate, has been the subject of an intensive effort to improve. The
   result, we believe, will be an outstanding system - soon to be
   operational in the Denver office. It is our hope that a very successful
   operational WFO-Advanced system in Denver will help the National
   Weather Service to an early and highly successful completion of the
   national AWIPS system.
