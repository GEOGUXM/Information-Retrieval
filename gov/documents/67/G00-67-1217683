   Congressman David E. Bonior


                           Tips for Winter Safety
     One of the most important jobs of a Member of Congress is helping
   people who need assistance with federal agencies. I take this
   [Biogra1.jpg] responsibility very seriously. If you have a problem,
   concern, or need assistance for any reason, I will do my best to help
   you. Please remember that I am only able to help residents of
   Michigan's 10th Congressional District. If you are unsure whether you
   live in the 10th Congressional District, please refer to the list of
   zip codes which are located in the 10th District or go to the House of
   Representatives home page which will allow you to find your
   representative in Congress.

   Every year, my office helps people with problems like tracking down a
   lost Social Security check, trying to get a passport in an emergency
   situation, or providing information about federal programs. While I
   can't guarantee to solve every problem, I will certainly do my best to
   help you. If you are having a problem with a federal agency (Veterans
   Administration, Passport Service, Social Security Administration,
   etc.), please call my office in Mount Clemens, Michigan at (810)
   469-3232. My staff and I will do our very best to help you.
