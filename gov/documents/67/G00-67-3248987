          + On July 2, 2001, BALCA issued a decision in Martin Kaplan,
            2000-INA-23 (BALCA July 2, 2001) (en banc), holding that
            cooking specialization requirements for domestic cooks are
            unduly restrictive within the meaning of 20 C.F.R. §
            656.21(b)(2), and therefore must be justified by business
            necessity. [more...]
          + In M.N. Auto Electric Corp., 2000-INA-165 (BALCA Aug. 8, 2001)
            (en banc), the Board held that the standard for documenting
            good faith efforts to contact U.S. applicants is reasonable
            efforts to contact the U.S. applicants, and not proof of
            actual contact. Accordingly, the Board held that a CO cannot
            require an employer to use certified mail, return receipt
            requested, when contacting applicants by mail. [more...]

   OALJ Archive
   The OALJ Archive is a repository of electronic slip opinions. Access to
   the OALJ Archive is provided in three ways:

   (1) Full-text search
   [Availability: most ALJ decisions issued from the fall of 1996 to date]
   [Black Lung Archive_________] ____________________ Search

   OR

   (2) DMS Search
   [Availability: Search results will soon link directly to electronic
   slip opinions issued on or after November 1, 2000; however, at present
   not all data has been linked to the system. DMS search may also be
   helpful for finding older decisions if you do not know the ALJ case
   number; however, links to older decisions are indirect.]

   OR

   (3) Directory browsing {O}
   [Availability: most ALJ decisions issued from the fall of 1996 to
   October 31, 2000]
   Note: To use directory browsing effectively, you must know the ALJ case
   number before you begin.

   Additional information: Electronic slip opinions do not constitute an
   official, reported decision. At present, only ALJ decisions are
   included in this archive. For reported ALJ, ARB, and Secretary of Labor
   decisions in electronic format, refer to the materials in the OALJ Law
   Library above. Opinions issued in longshore cases are withheld from the
   OALJ web site for 30-days to permit District Director to effect service
   of the decisions (see 20 C.F.R.§ 702.349). In case of discrepancies
   between the print and electronic slip opinions, the print version
   controls.

       Please note that the Office of Administrative Law Judges is an
   administrative court. Thus the OALJ WebMaster cannot provide assistance
    to persons seeking legal advice. See the FAQ page {u} for guidance on
                     which agency may be able to assist.
