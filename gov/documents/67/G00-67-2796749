                              EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

   Legislative Mandate

   In 1990, Congress amended the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act, also
   known as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The amendment
   mandated that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in
   consultation with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
   (ATSDR) and the Great Lakes states, submit to Congress by September 30,
   1994, a research report assessing the harmful human health effects of
   water pollutants in the Great Lakes basin. In support of this
   directive, Congress authorized funds not to exceed $3 million to carry
   out research to support this report for each of the fiscal years 1992,
   1993, and 1994. ATSDR received $2 million for fiscal year 1992 and $3
   million for each of the fiscal years 1993 and 1994 to support human
   health effects studies in the Great Lakes basin. This research program
   concludes in September 1995. Final results and conclusions will be
   available after that date.

   ATSDR Mission

   ATSDR's mission is to prevent exposure and adverse human health effects
   and diminished quality of life associated with exposure to hazardous
   substances from waste sites, unplanned releases, and other sources of
   pollution present in the environment. The activities described in this
   report support this mission and are consistent with achieving the
   health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People
   2000, a national strategy put forth by the U.S. Department of Health
   and Human Services to significantly improve the health of the nation
   over the next decade (DHHS 1991).

   Objectives of Research Program

   The ATSDR research program is designed to investigate and characterize
   the association between the consumption of contaminated Great Lakes
   fish and short- and long-term harmful health effects. The six
   objectives of the research program are to (1) build upon and extend the
   results from past and ongoing research; (2) develop information
   databases and research methodology or both that will provide long-term
   benefits to human health effects research efforts in the Great Lakes
   basin; (3) provide direction for future health effects research; (4)
   provide health information to state and local health officials, the
   concerned public, and their medical health care professionals; (5) in
   concert with state and local health officials, increase public
   awareness regarding the potential health implications of toxic
   pollution in the Great Lakes basin; and (6) coordinate as necessary
   with relevant Public Health Service (PHS) research programs and
   activities, including those of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes
   of Health (NIH), and the Indian Health Service (IHS), as well as EPA,
   and state and local health departments, to ameliorate adverse public
   health impacts of persistent toxic substances in the Great Lakes basin.

   Research Strategy

   Toward this end, ATSDR has developed a Great Lakes Health Effects
   Research Strategy. The goals of this strategy is to identify human
   populations residing in the Great Lakes basin that may be at greater
   risk of exposure to chemical contaminants present in one or more of the
   Great Lakes, and to help prevent any adverse health effects. This
   strategy is built upon the five traditional elements of disease
   prevention: identification, evaluation, control, dissemination, and
   infrastructure. This strategy has been endorsed by the Council of Great
   Lakes Research Managers and has been adopted by the International Joint
   Commission as a framework for the study of human health and other
   ecosystem effects in the Great Lakes basin.

   Research Grants Funded

   For fiscal year 1992, ATSDR funded nine research grants to study the
   potential adverse human health effects of consuming contaminated Great
   Lakes fish. These studies include eight epidemiologic investigations in
   presumed susceptible populations, that is, Native Americans, sport
   anglers, the urban poor, pregnant women, fetuses and nursing infants of
   mothers who consume contaminated Great Lakes fish, infants and
   children, and the elderly. The ninth study focuses on developing more
   sensitive methods to detect persistent Great Lakes contaminants, suh as
   polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, alkylated lead, mirex, and
   methylmercury, in human biologic tissues and fluids. The 10 grants
   funded by ATSDR for fiscal year 1993 include the nine continuation
   awards funded in 1992 and one new award that established an
   interlaboratory-based, quality assurance/quality control program for
   the ATSDR research program.

   The impact of this research program will be felt most directly by the
   communities within the Great Lakes basin. Collectively, these 10
   research projects will (1) build upon and extend six existing human
   health studies in the Great Lakes basin that include high- risk
   populations; (2) establish two new subpopulations that include
   African-American women and men and women of reproductive age (between
   18 and 34); (3) improve analytical methodology for detecting low levels
   of Great Lakes contaminants in human biologic tissues and fluids and in
   environmental media; (4) characterize exposure to all 11 critical Great
   Lakes contaminants identified by the International Joint Commission, as
   well as other pollutants; (5) determine profiles and levels (body
   burden) of Great Lakes contaminants in high-risk populations; (6)
   identify sensitive human health end points from exposure to Great Lakes
   pollutants, i.e., behavioral, developmental, reproductive, neurologic,
   endocrinologic, and immunologic effects; (7) investigate paternal and
   maternal exposure to Great Lakes pollutants and assess the potential
   for resulting health effects in their children (transgenerational
   effects); (8) increase collaboration, cooperation, and communication
   between the researchers in the Great Lakes basin; and (9) provide
   public health information to the study populations, health care
   providers, and state and local health departments concerning human
   health effects that may result from exposure to Great Lakes pollutants
   by fish consumption.

   Additionally, the research conducted by this program will help
   delineate the relationships among contaminant levels in the
   environment, exposure pathways, tissue levels, and potential human
   health effects; allow for evaluation and interpretation of data across
   all human health studies to facilitate a basin-wide analysis of the
   pollution problem in the Great Lakes; and provide a "model" for other
   ecosystem-level studies intended to determine human health impacts of
   hazardous waste.

   Further Information

   A brochure developed by ATSDR on the ATSDR Great Lakes Human Health
   Effects Research Program provides insight into ATSDR's early and
   continuing efforts to assess the adverse effects of water pollutants in
   the Great Lakes system on the health of people in the Great Lakes
   states.
