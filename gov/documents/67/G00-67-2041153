   Halocarbons & other Atmospheric Trace Species Group (HATS)

      The general mission of the Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace
      Species group is to quantify the distributions and magnitudes of the
      sources and sinks for atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) and halogen
      containing compounds. HATS utilizes numerous types of platforms,
      including ground-based stations, towers, ocean vessels, aircraft, and
      balloons, to accomplish its mission. For a detailed mission statement,
      click on the "FAQ" button.


     Airborne - Projects involve measuring important trace gases in the
    upper troposphere and stratosphere on aircraft and balloons, and even
   Unpiloted Airborne Vehicles (UAVs). The key result is the understanding
            the chemistry and transport of the upper atmosphere.
   Flasks - Research centers on obtaining the maximum science from weekly
      to monthly flasks samples collected worldwide and analyzed in our
        Boulder labs. These samples are used to determine current and
       historical trends, trace gas and OH distributions, and budgets.
   Instrumentation - Custom state-of-the-air instrumentation for measuring
   greenhouse gases, halocarbons, substitute halocarbons, and hydrocarbons
   is offered for unique platforms. Instrumentation was provided for some
             developing countries to monitor their trace gases.
    In Situ Sustainable Measurements - In situ observations at NOAA/CMDL
   baseline observatories, WMO GAW stations, Niwot Ridge, and tower sites
   located in Harvard Forest, Wisconsin, and Texas provide information on
       transport, emissions, and trends with the highest possible time
                                 resolution.
     Ocean - The oceans play an important role as sources and sinks for
     atmospheric trace species. The determination of fluxes between the
   surface seawater and the marine air require knowledge of the saturation
                 anomaly with air and the gas exchange rate.
      Standards - Research is conducted for developing and maintaining
   standard gas mixtures of atmospheric gases to calibrate instrumentation
   on the many platforms used in our studies. Custom standards provided as
          primary or secondary calibration mixtures are available.
