                      ADC Data on CD-ROMs & Other Media

   The ADC's astronomical catalogs and journal data tables are not only
   available via the Internet. Many of the most popular catalogs are
   available on the ADC's CD-ROMs. This can be a very convenient and
   cost-effective way to request ADC data, particularly for the larger
   catalogs. In addition, users may ask for selected data sets to be sent
   to them on one of several other computer media (e.g., CD-Recordable,
   8mm tape, diskette).

  How to request data on CD-Recordable, tape or diskette

   ADC catalogs can be obtained off-line on CD-Recordable, magnetic tape
   and floppy diskette for a fee . Ordering information may be obtained
   from the NSSDC Coordinated Request and User Support Office.

     Please Note: Certain catalogs have been updated since they were
     published on our CD-ROMs. Also, some errors may have been uncovered
     since the discs were produced. This information is compiled and is
     available via FTP from adc.gsfc.nasa.gov in the /pub/adc/errors/
     directory. Requesters are advised to check this information to
     ensure that they are using the best available data.
