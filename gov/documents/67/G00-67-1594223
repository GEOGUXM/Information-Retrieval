     __________________________________________________________________

   Overview

   There are approximately 40 to 50 ongoing OIG/GAO reviews of NIH
   Programs each year. Due to both increased funding to the NIH and a
   heightened interest in health issues, the number of reviews is rising.
   The Division of Management Assessment (DMA) provides for the central
   coordination of all OIG/GAO reviews performed at the NIH. DMA roles
   include:

     * Advocating for the needs of NIH by asking the OIG/GAO to also
       consider issues important to the NIH.
     * Place the OIG/GAO in contact with the correct people and make sure
       that everyone with a 'need to know' is aware of the review.
     * Help the OIG/GAO plan reviews.
     * Deal with issues that arise during a review.
     * Hold entrance and exit conferences.
     * Ensure that the NIH provides comments on draft reports.
     * Track the implementation of any recommendations.

   OIG/GAO Liaison

   The current acting OIG/GAO Liaison is Mary Jane Meyers (301) 402-8482.
