   WITS was the control tool used for the Robotic Arm and Robotic Arm
   Camera in the Mars Polar Lander mission.  It enabled distributed
   scientists to participate in sequence generation over the Internet- a
   first in NASA's history.  This website contains a public version of
   WITS for Mars Polar Lander that you can download and install on your
   computer!

   Features of WITS for Mars Polar Lander:

   witssmallpic.jpg (29026 bytes) Once installed, the public version of
   WITS will allow you to:
     * View images taken by the stereo surface imager in both mosaic views
       and in a simulated 3D view of the lander.
     * Build scripted sequences and watch them execute on a 3D simulated
       lander - just as the MPL robotic arm operations team does.
     * Interactively control the simulated arm and stereo surface imager.

   Get Started!
