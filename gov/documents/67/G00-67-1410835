   The Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate (MPS) supports a
   strong and diverse portfolio of research and education in mathematics,
   astronomical science, physics, chemistry, and materials research. The
   purpose of this work is both to deepen our understanding of the
   physical universe, and to use this understanding in service to society.
