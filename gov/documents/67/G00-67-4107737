                        Habitat Conservation Division
        Coordinating with individuals, industry, and local and state
    government, the Habitat Conservation Division (HCD) initiates methods
       to avoid or minimize the effect developments copper rockfish in
    eelgrass meadow have on living marine resources and their habitat in
       Alaska. This effort results in the preparation of environmental
    documents including pre-application planning, watershed planning, and
     mitigation to identify feasible alternatives and provide realistic
       recommendations to protect and conserve valuable living marine
   resources. HCD focuses on activities in the near shore coastal zone as
     well as some inland anadromous streams. HCD also considers actions
    affecting offshore living marine resources, especially those that may
        be impacted by oil and gas development, mining, or commercial
                                 fisheries.
