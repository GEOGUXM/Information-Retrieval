   NSSL Seminar Series
     __________________________________________________________________

   Unless otherwise noted, seminars will take place Fridays at 10:30 a.m.
   in the NSSL Main Conference Room. These seminars are free and open to
   the public; be aware, however, that these seminars are typically on a
   scientific level.

   The NSSL Seminar Series is currently run by Dave Schultz. This page is
   maintained by both Dave and Daphne Zaras.

   Get weekly announcements of NSSL seminars! Email Dave to get on the
   NSSL-Seminar Email-Announcement List.

   Thanks to a generous grant from the NSSL and SPC Employees Association
   the NSSL Seminar Series features refreshments before most seminars
   (10:15 a.m. in the lunchroom)!

   NSSL Seminars may be viewable on the web. Read this message from Robert
   Coggins about viewing these seminars.
