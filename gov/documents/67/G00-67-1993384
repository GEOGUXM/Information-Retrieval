                                  MSAS/RSAS



   Surface data is crucial for mesoscale weather forecasting because its
   time and space resolution is unmatched among in situ observations. The
   Mesoscale Analysis and Prediction System (MAPS) and the Rapid Update
   Cycle (RUC) Surface Assimilation Systems (MSAS/RSAS) exploit the
   resolution of surface data by providing timely and detailed surface
   analyses. RSAS (also known as the RUC Surface or "RUCS" system) runs
   operationally at the NWS's National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction (NCEP). MSAS runs operationally at NWS Forecast Offices as
   part of the AWIPS workstation, and contributes quality control
   information to the Quality Control and Monitoring System (QCMS) . RSAS
   also runs quasi-operationally in the FSL Central Facility to provide an
   operational backup to the NCEP system.
