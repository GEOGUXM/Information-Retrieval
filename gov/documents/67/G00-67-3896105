   the gamma ray sky showing the burst becoming the brightest object. On
   the right is a plot of the changing brightness with time.

                         What is a Gamma-ray Burst?

    Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) pose one of the greatest mysteries of modern
      astronomy. About once a day, the sky lights up with a spectacular
     flash, or burst, of gamma-rays. More often than not, this burst out
    shines all of the other sources of cosmic gamma-rays added together.
   The source of the burst then disappears altogether. No one can predict
     when the next burst will occur or from what direction in the sky it
   will come. At present, we don't even know what causes these flashes or
                           how far away they are!

    The first gamma-ray burst was seen in the year 1967 (although it was
     not reported to the world until 1973) by satellite-borne detectors
    intended to look for violations of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. What
     was seen in the data by Ray Klebesadel and others at the Los Alamos
   National Laboratory was an unexpected, large increase in the number of
    gamma-rays seen by detectors on several widely separated satellites.
    The data indicated that the source of the gamma-ray emission was not
   from the vicinity of Earth, but from a region of outer space! In their
    discovery paper, they reported the detection of 16 such events during
   the time July 1969 to July 1972. There was no doubt that the phenomena
   they reported was real... and that no one had a reasonable explanation
    for it. Now, twenty-five years and data from several thousand bursts
      later, scientists still have no clear explanation for the strange
                 celestial events we call gamma-ray bursts.
