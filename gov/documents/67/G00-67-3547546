                               Patient Privacy

   Patient Medical Information, Confidentiality and Privacy
      ______________________________________________________________________

      The confidentiality of your medical information is important to us.
      This means that we keep your medical information private-only for you
      and your clinical providers.

      Keeping your information private.

        Good health care depends on a good relationship with your care
        provider, a relationship based on the trust that we will respect
        your privacy about the information you provide. We protect your
        privacy in a number of ways so that you can feel secure.

      We protect confidentiality.

        We protect your personal information on our computer network. We
        have strict policies governing access and release of information. In
        effect, your medical file is being contained within an "electronic"
        safe-deposit box. All information gathered for treatment is kept
        secure so that only authorized staff can access your record. Our
        staff members have signed an agreement that they will protect your
        information and respect its confidential nature.

      How do we use your medical information?

        The VA Puget Sound Health Care System uses a state-of-the-art
        computer system that allows our providers to access your record at
        the time and place that it is needed, making critical medical
        information available to your provider almost instantly. This access
        contributes to high quality care for you.

        No one can look at your medical information without the appropriate
        authorization. No one can access your medical data for medical
        research purposes unless you agree, or unless the information is
        used in a way that your identity is not known. In order to improve
        the quality of medical care, we sometimes review medical records to
        make sure our doctors and nurses are practicing the highest quality
        of care. In these quality reviews, patient names are not used.

      How do we ensure privacy and confidentiality?

        Your care is a personal matter and we know that you want private
        things to remain private. We develop and comply with policies to
        ensure our employees respect confidentiality. We comply with all
        applicable Federal laws.

        We ask your permission before we release your medical record
        information to someone outside our Medical Center, unless the
        Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. Sec. 552a) authorizes disclosure without your
        consent.

        If we are required by law to release information, we will make a
        good faith effort to notify you. If you have questions regarding
        this important matter, please talk with your caregiver or call us at
        1-800-329-VETS, and ask for the Release of Information Section.
