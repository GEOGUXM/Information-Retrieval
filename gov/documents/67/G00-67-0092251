   Welcome to the EHRP Web site, which contains up-to-date information,
   news, and other materials related to the Department of Health and Human
   Services (HHS's) EHRP project.

   HHS is currently working to replace its existing human resources and
   payroll system with a new, state-of-the-art HR/Payroll product. The new
   system is based on PeopleSoft HRMS for Federal Government, which HHS
   will initially tie to its legacy system. Eventually, HHS expects to
   implement the PeopleSoft Federal Payroll products, as well, providing
   an integrated HR/Payroll solution.

   From January through June 2000, HHS evaluated the PeopleSoft HRMS
   software and performed architectural alternatives studies to provide
   the EHRP Steering Committee with information to make an informed "GO"
   decision. HHS is now actively engaged in detailed project planning for
   the systems development, prototype and pilot testing, and the eventual
   phased implementation of PeopleSoft HRMS across the Department.
