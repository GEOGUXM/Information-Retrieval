   Research Interests:

   James Hainfeld develops organometallic cluster compounds to be used as
   high resolution molecular labels. These heavy metal clusters are
   covalently attached to peptides, antibodies, other proteins, nucleic
   acids, carbohydrates or lipids to map sites of macromolecules or
   complexes for visualization in the Scanning Transmission Electron
   Microscope (STEM). Such clusters have been useful in studying the
   proteasome, pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex, actin filaments,
   viruses, blood clotting components, nuclear proteins, and other
   structures. Use of clusters in anomalous X-ray scattering or for
   isomorphous replacements is being investigated also. Gold, platinum,
   palladium, silver, iridium, and other metal clusters have been
   synthesized. Recently, gold clusters having Nickel-NTA for binding
   6x-His tagged proteins, gold-liposomes, gold-cluster-ATP, and giant
   platinum clusters have been studied.


   [stem_icon.jpg] He also is co-principal investigator (with Joseph Wall)
   of the NIH Biotechnology Resource Scanning Transmission Electron
   Microscope STEM Facility which currently hosts over 50 user projects
   per year from around the world. These projects focus on use of the STEM
   for mass measurements of single molecules, or of gold cluster labeling
   for identifying molecular sites.

   The article 'New Ways to Tag, Track Molecules' gives an account of the
   golden opportunities in metal cluster labeling of molecular complexes.
   See the Brookhaven Bulletin of April 7, 2000 (Vol 54 No 12), and the
   BNL Press Release of January 10, 2000.

   Cover: The smallest gold-conjugated antibody label yet developed is
   demostrated in this pseudocolored electron micrograph. Anti-ferritin
   Fab' antibody fragments are covalently linked to 11 gold atom clusters
   (yellow spots, discerned by high pass filtration) and attached to
   ferritin, which consists of a protein shell surrounding an iron core
   (red).
