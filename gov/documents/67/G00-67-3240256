      Welcome to the NIH Computer Security Awareness Training Web page
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Office of Information Resources Management (OIRM), Center for
   Information Technology (CIT), has developed a computer-based training
   course, this web page, and a downloadable MS Word document to provide
   you with an overview of basic computer and information security
   practices.

   The Computer Security Act requires that all U.S. Government personnel
   who use computers, as part of their work activities, complete training
   on computer security awareness.

   The NIH Office of Information Resource Management and the NIH Division
   of Workforce Development are very interested in your comments about the
   interactive course, this web page, or the downloadable Word document.


    Please forward any comments to: OIRMT1@NIH.GOV

                                Introduction

   You arrive at the office on Monday morning, get your first cup of
   coffee, turn on your computer, and bring up your E-mail. You have one
   new message, it says, "Two computer security experts will be arriving
   at your office today to brief you on computer security issues. Please
   accompany these experts through NIH offices, and learn as much as you
   can about the security requirements. This is an important
   responsibility, so be sure to give it your close attention."

   [jl1-2.gif] Later that day they arrive. Hi, I'm Jack Redd, and this is
   Linda Brant. We're computer security consultants who specialize in
   government organizations like NIH. We're experts in government computer
   security requirements and standards that everyone at NIH is expected to
   follow. We were sent here by the Office of Information Resource
   Management (OIRM) to brief you on computer security issues. We would
   like to tour the NIH campus to see how everyone uses their computers,
   see if there are any procedures that can be improved, and brief you on
   the recommended security practices.

   But before we get started, let's go over the objectives of our visit.
   First, it is essential that you and everyone at NIH understand the
   potential problems that can result from inadequate computer and
   information security. Almost everyone at NIH uses computers to some
   degree, and for many, computers are essential to their work. So it is
   critical that all users understand how their computers and information
   are vulnerable to damage, and how they can take steps to protect their
   systems.

   The following list is typical of the types of problems that can occur
   if good information security measures are not followed.

                                  Case #103

   Files containing several months worth of scientific research lost in a
                           computer virus attack.

   Computer viruses are programs that can enter a computer system without
   the users knowledge and damage the information contained on floppy and
   hard disk drives. Viruses can usually be detected by anti-virus
   software that scans computer files before they are copied to a
   computer.

                                  Case #112

    Floppy disks containing important administrative records damaged by a
                              magnetic source.

   Floppy disks and hard disk drives can be easily damaged by contact with
   magnetic sources, or damaged physically by bending floppy disks. Once
   damaged, in many cases the data contained on the disks cannot be
   recovered. It is important to know how each of these storage media can
   be damaged, and precautions that can minimize the potential for damage.

                                  Case #133

   Important scientific article lost when the writer's computer is stolen.

   Information stored on a computer is subject to the same threats as
   information on paper. It can be lost, damaged, or stolen. Creating a
   backup copy, that is stored elsewhere, of all important information is
   essential, and usually a simple procedure.

                                  Case #184

      Lab work disrupted for 3 days due to failure of computer program
                       controlling the lab equipment.

   Computers that are used to control processes are subject to the same
   threats as any other computer, but since the entire process is
   dependent on the computer functioning properly, extra care should be
   taken to protect the computer and the programs and data on the computer
   from damage.

                                  Case #211

    Grant application delayed when essential computer file is saved with
                            the wrong file name.

   Minor errors in data entry can make it impossible to find an important
   file. Proper accounting and storage of computer files is an important
   aspect of data security.

                                  Case #254

    Confidential patient records sent to wrong printer - placed in plain
                   view next to printer for several hours.

   Simple errors, such as mistakenly sending a confidential printout to
   the incorrect printer, can compromise the security of your information.
   So always use extra care when dealing with sensitive or confidential
   information.

   Everyone at NIH must understand that these types of problems can happen
   to them if they are not careful, and that they must take personal
   responsibility for protecting their computers and their data.

   Whenever we visit an organization, the first thing we try to
   communicate is the personal and organizational impact of any of these
   types of problems. We try to get people to think about how they would
   be affected if all of their files were wiped out by a virus, or were
   copied and released for anyone to read. In some cases it would be
   minor, but in other cases it could affect months of work. And here at
   NIH, the results could be tragic.
