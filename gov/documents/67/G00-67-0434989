  U.S. Education Department Grants Loan Relief to Terrorist Attack Victims

    Also announces assistance to NY colleges and universities in meeting
                           reporting requirements

   To help victims of the recent terrorist attacks, the U.S. Department of
   Education announced today that it has directed lenders who have made or
   hold federal student loans to provide financial relief from monthly
   loan payments to those borrowers affected by the terrorist attacks.

   "As a government, we have pledged to help meet the needs of New Yorkers
   and other victims of the terrorist attack, and the steps we are
   announcing today will provide financial relief during these
   extraordinary circumstances," said U.S. Secretary of Education Rod
   Paige.

   On September 11, 2001, President Bush designated the five boroughs of
   New York City (Brooklyn, The Bronx, Manhattan, Staten Island, and
   Queens) as being eligible for national disaster assistance.

   Under the department's guidance, lenders are directed to grant
   "mandatory administrative forbearance" to borrowers who live or work in
   the New York City disaster assistance area. The procedure allows
   affected borrowers to postpone or reduce the amount of monthly payments
   from September 11, 2001, through January 31, 2002, due to the change in
   their financial circumstances resulting from the attacks. Mandatory
   administrative forbearance does not require either a request or
   documentation from the borrower.

   Forbearance will also be granted to borrowers outside the national
   disaster area but who were affected by any of the terrorist attacks and
   hijackings. Borrowers or families need to contact their lender, and
   forbearance will be granted upon request. Forbearance beyond January
   will require documentation and a written forbearance agreement between
   loan holder and borrower.

   The relief is provided to borrowers who are in repayment under the
   Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL), the William D. Ford Federal
   Direct Loan (Direct Loan), and Federal Perkins Loan Programs.

   Default collection activities are also on a hold until January 31,
   2002, for borrowers in the New York City area. Other defaulted
   borrowers impacted by the disaster may be granted relief from
   collection activities upon request.

   Lenders were also given administrative flexibility in filing death
   discharges without contacting the borrower's family.

   In additional guidance, the department extended certain reporting
   deadlines for postsecondary schools in New York City. The deadlines
   have been extended for Federal Pell Grant reporting and disbursement
   records, Direct Loan records submission, and the report for the
   campus-based federal student aid programs.

   Through a continuing series of actions, the Education Department will
   address other issues that relate to administrative and regulatory
   relief for those affected by the terrorist attacks. If borrowers or
   their families have questions about the department's guidance issued
   thus far, they should call 1-800-4 FED AID (1-800-433-3243) (TTY
   800-730-8913) for information and assistance.

   "It will take some time for people to return to their jobs and resume
   their lives. It is my sincere hope that the department's efforts will
   help ease the strain on those who have suffered so much and help them
   get back to business," Paige said.
