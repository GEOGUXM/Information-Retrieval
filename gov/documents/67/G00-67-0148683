   News from the International Telework Association & Council (ITAC) RURAL
   TELEWORK ACT OF 2000 Senator Paul Wellstone (MN) is introducing a bill
   this week entitled the "Rural Telework Act of 2000". ITAC has been
   working with the Senator's office in defining telework and has reviewed
   key components of the bill. The need for maximizing our employment pool
   of skilled teleworkers and expanding economic development opportunities
   in remote areas was addressed in the ITAC testimony to the House
   sub-committee on Education and the Workforce (October 28, 1999) when
   ITAC urged Congress to "provide grants to encourage the use of telework
   to create jobs in rural and disadvantaged areas, provide matching
   grants for approved telework training programs, and provide a Telework
   Extension Service similar to the USDA Extension Service". The Rural
   Telework Act of 2000 would provide competitive grants to qualified
   organizations to implement five-year projects to train, connect, and
   employ in the private sector through telework a population of rural
   workers in their community. A grant recipient would be designated as a
   National Center for Distance Working. Check the ITAC website for
   further information. Also, the bill can be found through the government
   website: http://Thomas.loc.gov or directly on Senator Wellstone's
   website: http://www.senate.gov~wellstone. To support this bill, contact
   your U.S. Senator.

   BILL NUMBER: AB 1984 INTRODUCED BY Assembly Member Zettel FEBRUARY 18,
   2000 An act to add and repeal Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 55720)
   of Part 2 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code, relating to
   local government finance. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST AB 1984, as
   introduced, Zettel. Telecommuting centers: economic incentives.
   Existing law does not authorize local government entity to provide an
   economic incentive to individuals and entities specifically with
   respect to personal property that is necessary for telecommuting. This
   bill would, as provided and until January 1, 2010, authorize a city,
   county, city and county, special district, or redevelopment agency to
   enter into an agreement with the owner of telecommuting center
   property, as defined, under which the governmental entity would, for a
   period of up to five consecutive fiscal years, pay a Telecommuting
   Property Amount (TPA), as defined, to that property owner under
   conditions specified in the agreement. This bill would apply this
   authorization only to telecommuting center property that is first
   placed in service on or after January 1, 2001.
