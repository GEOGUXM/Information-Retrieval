   [00Jul20.1255.firstFastRamp.gif] 12:55 July 20 2000: First successful
   fast ramp of
   both RHIC beams to 65 GeV/u
   After work on quench protection tuning and power supply fast ramping
   during a RHIC experiment maintenance period, we have accelerated both
   yellow and blue beams with few transition losses to gamma=70 (E=65
   GeV/u). These ramping speeds will permit much more progress in
   iterative ramp tuning and restoration of collision conditions between
   RHIC stores.
