                  Principles of Good Practice for Distance
                         Learning/Web-Based Courses
     (Adopted by the Coordinating Board for Higher Education, April 13,
                                    2000)
     __________________________________________________________________

   When providing courses and programs through distance learning methods,
   institutions should establish standards and encourage academic
   integrity equivalent to courses offered in a traditional, campus-based
   environment. These Principles of Good Practice, adapted from the 1999
   Guidelines for Distance Education by the North Central Association
   Commission on Institutions of Higher Education (NCA), are suggested as
   a guide for Missouri institutions as they develop and implement courses
   for, and assess their involvement in, distance education and web-based
   course delivery.

   The intent of these principles is to encourage reflection on quality
   and best practices as faculty and institutions negotiate the rapidly
   changing and sometimes unfamiliar territory that such courses
   inherently have. Institutions are encouraged to operationalize these
   principles in locally-directed ways that result in meaningful steps
   toward ensuring high quality.


   I. Distance learning courses and programs, including web-based courses,
   should maintain high academic integrity.
     * Institutions should ensure both the rigor of courses and the
       quality of instruction.
     * Institutions should ensure that the technology used is appropriate
       to the nature and objectives of each course.
     * Institutions should ensure the currency of materials, programs, and
       courses.
     * Each institutions distance education policies regarding ownership
       of materials, faculty compensation, copyright issues, and
       utilization of revenue derived from the creation and production of
       software, telecourses, or other media products should be clear and
       in writing.
     * Institutions should provide appropriate faculty support services
       specifically related to distance education.
     * Institutions should provide appropriate technological and
       pedagogical training for faculty who teach distance education
       courses/web-based courses.
     * Faculty should engage in timely and adequate interaction with
       students and, when appropriate, should encourage interaction among
       students.
     * Institutions should ensure that distance learning courses and
       web-based courses apply toward degrees and that there is sufficient
       explanation to the distance learner how those courses apply toward
       degrees.

   II. Distance learning and web-based courses and programs should be
   assessed and evaluated regularly.
     * Institutions should assess student capability to succeed in
       distance education programs and should apply this information to
       admission and recruiting policies and decisions.
     * Institutions should evaluate the educational effectiveness of their
       distance education programs and web-based courses (including
       assessments of student learning outcomes, student retention, and
       student satisfaction) to ensure comparability to campus-based
       programs.
     * Institutions should ensure that the performance of distance
       learning faculty and faculty involved in providing web-based
       courses is evaluated in a fashion that is at least as rigorous as
       the performance of their peers who do not teach distance learning
       courses.
     * Institutions should ensure, to a reasonable extent, the integrity
       of student work.

   III. Institutions involved in distance education and web-based
   instruction should ensure that students have access to adequate
   resources and services.
     * Institutions should have access to the equipment and technical
       expertise required for distance education
     * Institutions should ensure that students have access to, and can
       effectively use, appropriate library resources (through traditional
       and electronic means), including MOBIUS, a consortium of Missouris
       academic libraries.
     * Institutions should monitor whether students make appropriate use
       of learning resources.
     * Institutions should provide laboratories, facilities, equipment,
       and software appropriate to the courses or programs and/or make
       clear to students the responsibilities they have to provide their
       own such equipment.
     * Institutions should provide adequate access to a range of student
       services appropriate to support distance learning courses and
       programs, including (but not limited to) admissions, enrollment,
       assessment, tutorials, special needs access, financial aid,
       academic advising, delivery of course materials, placement, and
       counseling.
     * Institutions should provide an adequate means for resolving student
       complaints.
     * Institutions should provide students with information that
       adequately and accurately represents the programs, requirements,
       and services available.
     * Institutions should ensure that students enrolled in courses
       possess the knowledge and equipment necessary to use the technology
       employed in the program and should provide aid to students who are
       experiencing difficulty using the required technology.
