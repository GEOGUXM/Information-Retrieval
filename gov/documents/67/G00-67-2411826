   Historically, the Kissimmee River meandered approximately 103 miles
   from Lake Kissimmee to Lake Okeechobee, through a 1-2 mile wide
   floodplain . The river and its flanking floodplain comprised a mosaic
   of wetland plant communities and supported a diverse group of
   waterfowl, wading birds, fish, and other wildlife.

   The river was channelized, and two-thirds of the historical floodplain
   was drained between 1962 and 1971 -- to prevent catastrophic flooding .
    There were also unintended impacts: drastic declines in wintering
   waterfowl, wading bird and game fish populations; as well as a loss of
   ecosystem functions.

   The Kissimmee River restoration project was authorized by the U.S.
   Congress in the Water Resources Development Act of 1992.  The project
   will restore an estimated 40 sq. miles of river/floodplain ecosystem.
