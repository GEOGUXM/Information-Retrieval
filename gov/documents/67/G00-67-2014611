                      ABOUT THE DISTRICT'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS


   The Board of Directors is the governing body of the Elk Grove Community
   Services District (CSD). The Board is responsible for formulating and
   approving policies for the operation, control, administration, and
   planning of the District's facilities and activities within the
   District. The five members of the Board are elected on a non-partisan
   basis by the public at large to four-year staggered terms. At the
   beginning of each year, the Board selects from its members a President
   and Vice-President to serve during the ensuing year. The President
   presides over meetings and signs all contracts and documents authorized
   by the Board. The Vice-president presides over meetings and performs
   other duties in the absence of the President. Correspondence for any of
   the Board members may be sent in care of the CSD's Administrative
   Services Department at 8820 Elk Grove Blvd., Suite 1, Elk Grove, CA
   95624.

                             BOARD MEETING INFORMATION


   Regular CSD Board meetings are held on the first and third Tuesdays of
   each month beginning at 6:30 p.m. Unless otherwise advertised, all
   meetings are held in the Board Room of the Elk Grove CSD Building
   located at 8820 Elk Grove Boulevard in Elk Grove. These are public
   meetings and residents are encouraged to attend. Matters to be
   presented at Board meetings are listed in an agenda prepared, in
   advance, by the Secretary of the Board. To place an item on the agenda,
   you should submit a written request to the Secretary of the Board by
   5:00 p.m. on the Monday one week prior to the meeting. Communications
   from the public are encouraged. The Board of Directors may receive
   testimony and set matters for a subsequent meeting, however, state law
   prohibits the Board from addressing any items not previously included
   on the agenda. Board voting is done verbally and recorded by the
   Secretary of the Board in the meeting minutes. Copies of Board meeting
