   INTRODUCTION


      This section contains bibliographies on research integrity and articles
      authored by ORI staff. Scientific misconduct case statistics are
      available under the database heading. Websites developed by
      organizations that are addressing research integrity and research
      misconduct issues in other countries can be found under the
      international heading along with articles about the activities of those
      organizations and misconduct cases in those countries. Other links
      connect to websites in the Federal government, scientific societies,
      and professional organizations that have useful information related to
      research integrity, the responsible conduct of research, and research
      misconduct.
