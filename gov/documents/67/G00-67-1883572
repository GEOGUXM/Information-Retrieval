   Introduction: Many salmon and steelhead populations in the Columbia
   River Basin will be extinct or nearly so by the end of this century,
   unless the region makes major changes to improve their survival. The
   decline of the Columbias once-numerous fish runs is well documented.
   The human activities that have caused the decline of these fish are
   habitat, harvest, hatcheries, and hydropower. Federal agencies have a
   fundamental responsibility under the Endangered Species Act to prevent
   extinction and foster recovery of listed species.

   Status of Columbia-Snake Salmon & Steelhead: Many factors have
   contributed to the decline of salmon and steelhead throughout the
   Columbia Basin. Salmon are extremely hardy, traveling hundreds, even
   thousands of miles from river to ocean and back. However, they require
   specific habitat conditions to thrive, including sufficient flows of
   cool, clean water; gravel beds free of sediment where they can spawn; a
   healthy nutrient base; and passable migration corridors.

   Human activities have been taking a toll on salmon and their habitats
   for well over a century. Once-plentiful populations were dramatically
   reduced by over-fishing; the regions canning industry reached peak
   production in 1920. Water diversions for agricultural, municipal, and
   other purposes have reduced stream and river flows. Activities such as
   logging, farming and urban development have destroyed spawning and
   rearing grounds. Polluted runoff, in both cities and rural areas, has
   degraded water quality. Construction of hydroelectric and irrigation
   dams has created barriers to juvenile salmon migrating to sea and adult
   salmon returning to spawn. Even hatcheries, intended to compensate for
   the harm caused by dams, have contributed to the decline of wild fish
   by introducing diseases, creating competition for food, and diluting
   the gene pool.

   Wild salmon and steelhead runs that once numbered in the millions have
   dwindled to just thousands or, in some cases, hundreds. Several
   populations are now extinct. Twelve are listed under the Endangered
   Species Act as threatened or endangered, while several others remain
   reasonably healthy.

   History of Salmon Recovery Efforts: Efforts to rebuild salmon in the
   Columbia-Snake River Basin began as early as 1877 with construction of
   the first hatchery. As dams were built over the next century, attempts
   were made to minimize their harm by including structures such as fish
   ladders to help salmon migrate upriver. They have been supplemented in
   recent years by improved river flows, spill to pass fish over dams, and
   barges to move salmon around the dams.

   In 1980, the Northwest Power Act created a requirement for a
   state-directed Columbia basin fish and wildlife program to protect and
   restore salmon and other fish and wildlife in the basin. In 1985, the
   United States and Canada signed the Pacific Salmon Treaty limiting
   ocean harvest of salmon. The federal government has established other
   harvest limits to address over-fishing. Around the same time, state,
   local, and tribal efforts began to address habitat restoration through
   watershed plans.

   None of these efforts proved to be enough. Intensified restoration
   activities began in the 1990s after three Snake River runs were
   declared threatened or endangered. However, in 1994, the National
   Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) biological opinion requiring changes in
   hydropower operations to aid the protected species was challenged in
   court and deemed inadequate.

   A new biological opinion issued in 1995 established stronger
   protections, including increased flows and measures to improve water
   quality and temperature. It set a goal of adopting a revised biological
   opinion by the end of 1999. It also committed the U.S. Army Corps of
   Engineers to prepare an environmental impact statement on breaching the
   Snake River dams. The corps issued a draft EIS in December 1999.

   The 1995 biological opinion has been amended to incorporate additional
   protections as several other Columbia and Snake River runs have been
   declared threatened or endangered - now a total of 12 listed
   populations.

   In December 1999, the nine agencies that make up the Federal Caucus
   released a draft of the Conceptual Recovery Plan ("All-H Paper")
   outlining the difficult choices the region faces in recovering listed
   species.

   In 15 public hearings, the Federal Caucus heard from more than 9,000
   Northwest citizens. Over 60,000 written comments were received on the
   Plan and the Army Corps of Engineers Lower Snake River Juvenile Salmon
   Migration Feasibility Study and Draft Environmental Impact Statement.
   The Federal Caucus also consulted with the regions Indian tribes, who
   have a special interest in the natural and cultural resources of the
   basin, especially its fish and wildlife. The message was clear. The
   people and governments of the region will make sacrifices to save the
   fish, but they want the burden to be shared and they want actions that
   will work.

   On July 27, 2000, the Federal Caucus released another draft of the Plan
   (entitled "Draft Basin-Wide Salmon Recovery Strategy") to states and
   tribes for a 60-day technical review.

   On December 21, 2000, the Federal Caucus released the final Strategy
   (entitled "Final Basinwide Salmon Recovery Strategy"). In preparing the
   final Strategy, the Federal Caucus considered the public comments
   received during the formal comment period as well as additional
   technical comments from the states and tribes. For a summary of the
   public comments and responses, along with information on state and
   tribal comments, see Volume 3 of the Final Strategy (125 pages, PDF,
   478 kb). A summary of changes between the July 27th Draft and the
   December 21st Final (PDF, 250 kb) is also available.
