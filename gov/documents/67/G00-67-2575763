   Characterization of Buried Transuranic Wastes

   1/22/2002

   EAD has worked with the DOE to develop updated information for buried
   TRU wastes to support development of appropriate long-term management
   plans.

   Radioactive wastes meeting the current definition of transuranic (TRU)
   wastes were disposed of by shallow land burial and other techniques at
   a number of sites owned and operated by the federal government in
   support of the nuclear weapons program from the 1940s through 1970s.
   These wastes are generally referred to as buried TRU wastes. Following
   the identification of TRU wastes as a separate category of radioactive
   wastes (as distinct from low-level wastes) in 1970 by the U.S. Atomic
   Energy Commission, such wastes were generally segregated and placed in
   retrievable storage pending the availability of a geologic repository.
   This geologic repository, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant located near
   Carlsbad, New Mexico, began accepting wastes in 1999.

   Questions have been raised by various organizations on the volume and
   activity associated with buried TRU wastes, which are located at sites
   operated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Disposal records for
   such wastes are at best poor and in many instances nonexistent. Argonne
   Environmental Assessment Division (EAD) worked with the DOE to develop
   updated information for buried TRU wastes to respond to these questions
   and support development of appropriate long-term management plans. This
   was accomplished through development of a data call that was issued to
   the Field Offices having buried TRU wastes. The responses to the data
   call were reviewed for consistency with previously reported information
   and compiled into a database. ANL worked with the Field Offices to
   ensure that the information provided was accurate and represented the
   best available information.

   The total volume of buried TRU wastes at DOE sites is approximately
   126,000 m^3 with a much smaller volume (about 11,000 m^3) disposed of
   at intermediate depths. The total TRU activity in these previously
   disposed of wastes is about 755,000 curies. While the Field Offices
   indicated that the level of confidence associated with these estimates
   is low to medium, these new data represent a major improvement in the
   quality of the inventory information and can be used to support ongoing
   policy decisions for management of these wastes. Additional details on
   the volume and activity of buried TRU wastes and the process used to
   collect and compile this information is given in a paper published in
   the January 2002 edition of Health Physics.*
