   Want to sell to the federal government? Start by going to womenbiz.gov,
       the premiere, online gateway for women-owned businesses. At this
       site, you can register your business with federal government
       contractor databases. The three main government registries are
       PRO-Net, Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Electronic
       Posting System (EPS). Access and information about these sites can
       be found at
       http://www.womenbiz.gov
       "Selling to the Federal Government" is an SBA guide offering a
       step-by-step introduction to the world of federal contracting, and
       demystifies the technical and marketing challenges that contracting
       involves.
       Once you've mastered the basics, you will soon be able to move on
       to our EC/EDI section that will cover more advanced topics in
       "Electronic Commerce and Electronic Data Interchange:"
       SBA has recently added a new office called Contracting Assistance
       for Women Business Owners. Check their site for some helpful
       information.
       Another important site for doing business with the Government is
       www.govcommerce.net.
