     Directions

       This community based outpatient clinic, established in 1998, is
      designed to bring primary care closer to where veterans live. The
   primary care team manages most health issues and provides veterans with
     access to a wide range of specialty care providers at the VA Boston
     Healthcare System when appropriate and necessary. The clinic offers
                             ample free parking.

                                 DIRECTIONS:
    From Rt. 128 or from Rt. 1 in Boston, take Rt. 9 (W) past the Natick
    Mall and past Shoppers World. Look Carefully for Rt. 126 (S) and take
     across Rt. 9 (becomes Concord St.) and pass both the National Guard
   Armory and Courthouse, on the right. Stay on Concord St. until you come
   to Lincoln St., and make a right onto Lincoln. Lincoln Medical Building
    is on the right (61 Lincoln St.). Go to Suite 112 for the VA Clinic.
