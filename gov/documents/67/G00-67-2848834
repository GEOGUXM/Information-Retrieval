LEADING THE WAY:
HOMELAND SECURITY IN YOUR COMMUNITY
A Publication of the International Association of Fire Chiefs

   The International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) prepared this
   manual in response to the coordinated terrorist attacks of September
   11, 2001. The terrorist threat, as well as the creation of the homeland
   security position and the role of the fire and emergency services as
   domestic defenders, requires that all fire departments - metro and
   rural, career, volunteer and combination - assess their preparedness
   and response capabilities.

   This is not an all-encompassing "how-to" guide for responding to a
   terrorist event. Instead, this document should be used to help you:
     * Open dialogue with your elected officials and your community;
     * Reevaluate your fire departments procedures;
     * Identify areas needing attention in your present system;
     * Heighten your fire departments personnel awareness of terrorism;
     * Incorporate new things you have not thought of before; and
     * Implement changes to current systems.

   Also included are sample letters to your elected officials, as well as
   a brief guide to help you develop public awareness. In addition, this
   document provides a list of additional resources with detailed
   information on preparing for and responding to a terrorist event.

   Leading the Way: Homeland Security in Your Community may be downloaded
   in Portable Document Format from the IAFC web site.
