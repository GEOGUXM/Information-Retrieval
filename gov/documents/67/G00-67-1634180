WRDA Funding: A Crucial Step In Saving Louisianas Coast

   For nearly 70 years Louisianas complex system of coastal marshes,
   waterways, lakes and barrier islands has been radically changed by the
   influence of man and industry. While land subsidence and sea level rise
   have taken their toll, the development of oil and gas resources, the
   shipping industry and flood control levees have exacted a price as
   well. Countless channels and canals have been carved through protective
   reefs and deep into freshwater wetlands, redirecting flows and
   providing avenues for salt-bearing tides. Spoil banks and levees have
   isolated marshes from their natural supplies of fresh water, sediment
   and nutrients, causing vegetation to fail and exposing a weakened
   environment to erosion. As a result, this remarkable ecosystem is being
   converted to open water at the rate of 25 to 35 square miles a yearthe
   equivalent of a football field every 30 minutesputting southern
   Louisiana on track to lose 1,000 additional square miles of coastal
   wetlands by the year 2050.

   As disheartening as those figures are, the story of Louisianas
   disappearing coast goes beyond the loss of land. Its about an American
   environment thats vanishing at a catastrophic rate. Its about
   communities, industry, infrastructure, wildlife habitat, fisheries and
   economies at risk. And, most important, its about the loss of the
   national treasure found in coastal Louisianas unique culture.

   Faced with this grim reality, Congress responded in 1990 with the
   passage of the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration
   Act (CWPPRA). Over the next ten years, this crucial piece of
   legislation provided up to $53 million per year in federal funding to
   protect and restore coastal wetlands in Louisiana. More than 100
   projects of varying size were started or completed with others
   identified, evaluated and recommended for implementation. These
   projects are expected to protect 86,000 acres of wetlands in nine
   hydrologic regions across Louisianas coastal zone.

   With the CWPPRA effort well under way, private citizens, local
   governments, state and federal agency personnel and the scientific
   community began the massive task of developing a comprehensive,
   ecosystem-based plan to address coastal wetland loss throughout
   southern Louisiana. In December 1998, this group completed Coast 2050:
   Towards a Sustainable Coastal Louisiana, in which they referenced the
   Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana (1998) in saying . .
   restoration requires a single coastal plan with a clear, overarching
   strategic vision; a process for ensuring effective public input to
   restoration planning; and integration of restoration projects into the
   overall coastal management system. Coast 2050 successfully achieved
   each of those objectives. From lessons and data gathered from CWPPRA,
   from new quantitative techniques for projecting land-loss patterns and
   the first coastwide assessment of subsidence rates, the plan outlined a
   conceptual framework that clearly articulates the future course of
   coastal restoration.

   It was, however, beyond the scope of Coast 2050 to produce the
   technical analysis to put projects on the ground. Consequently, the
   U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Louisiana Department of Natural
   Resources began to develop the Louisiana Coastal Area Feasibility
   Study. This study, which will contain the engineering and technical
   work absent from Coast 2050, is a key step in securing funding under
   the Water Resources Development Act 2002 (WRDA)the nations single
   largest source of water-project dollars. Because WRDA is so crucial and
   the feasibility study plays such an important role in the funding
   justification, this special issue of WaterMarks will introduce and
   highlight some of its essential components.

The Thrust of the Study

   As an integral step in the overall restoration plan, the Louisiana
   Coastal Area Feasibility Study takes into consideration the need to:
     * Design restoration projects to mimic natural landforms and
       processes as closely as possible;
     * Protect communities and infrastructures such as highways,
       pipelines, wells and ports;
     * Proceed from the perimeter to the interior of a basin, building the
       framework for landforms that will facilitate interior restoration;
     * Develop a computer model to give insight into water movements,
       allowing better project planning.

   Over the next 10 years, the Louisiana Coastal Area Feasibility Study
   will cover the nine Coastal Area Risk hydrologic basins that represent
   the Louisiana coast. The first phase of this coast-wide effort focuses
   on the Barataria Basin.

   The Barataria Basin was chosen as the starting point because it is
   experiencing the highest rate of land loss in the Louisiana coastal
   area estimated at 11 square miles per year. From 1932 to 1990, 35
   percent of its marsh was converted to open watera land loss
   approaching 360,000 acres. A best estimate predicts that an
   additional 19 percent of the remaining marsh, including 32 percent of
   the saline marsh, will be lost by 2050. As the marshes vanish, the
   protective barrier islands on the basins coast are disappearing as
   wellsuccumbing to some of the highest shoreline erosion rates in the
   nation.

   It is expected that without increased restoration efforts, the barrier
   islands within the study area will be gone by 2050, and the headland
   will continue to retreat at an average rate of 44 feet per year.

   The Barataria study will develop project plans to restore the fringe of
   the basin and develop a hydrologic and hydrodynamic computer model that
   will enable a basinwide assessment of other ecosystem restoration
   strategies. The study is divided into three closely interrelated
   components:
    1. Barrier Shoreline Restoration,
    2. Wetlands Creation and Restoration and
    3. Hydrologic and Hydrodynamic Model Development.

   The first component, Barrier Shoreline Restoration, will develop
   projects that sustain the ecological attributes of the basin, including
   a unique arrangement of habitats such as shallow intertidal zones,
   beaches, dunes, back-marshes, bays and passes. The barrier shoreline is
   the first line of defense against the Gulf of Mexicos waves and
   salinity, providing protection to the remaining marsh and aquatic
   habitats behind the islands. The second component, Wetlands Creation
   and Restoration, will develop projects to create and restore the
   basins marshes on the southwestern fringe, as well as wooded stop-over
   habitat for neotropical migratory birds. The third component,
   Hydrologic Model Development, will build a basin-wide hydrologic and
   hydrodynamic computer model of the water circulation and salinity
   patterns within the entire basin. This model will be used as the
   operations and planning guide for both existing and future projects,
   and freshwater diversions.

   Scientists and engineers will learn a great deal during the first phase
   of their work in the Barataria Basin. For example, the hydrologic and
   hydrodynamic computer model will be used extensively as projects
   planned for the basin interior are evaluated, constructed and placed in
   operation. The model and the lessons learned will then be exported for
   use in other basins of the coastal zone.

Public Involvement

   Consistent with the approach in developing the Coast 2050 Plan, public
   comment on the feasibility study has been instrumental in establishing
   concepts, goals and strategies. During the early stages of planning,
   project managers held a series of public meetings.
     * In March and May 2000, the public was provided information and
       asked for general guidance during two informal meetings in
       Thibodaux. Additionally, two presentations made to the
       Barataria-Terrebonne National Estuary Program Management Conference
       were attended by many stakeholders from business and industry,
       federal and state agencies and nonprofit organizations.
     * In June 2000, two formal public scoping meetings were held during
       the formation of the studys environmental impact statement for the
       Barrier Shoreline Restoration and Wetland Creation and Restoration
       components. Comments in these meetings formed the basis for much of
       the planning that guided development of the restoration measures.
     * In February and March 2001, as restoration project plans were
       formulated, formal public meetings were held in Baton Rouge, Larose
       and Belle Chasse. Project managers provided information about study
       areas and objectives, and solicited information on alternate
       locations and methods.

   Two additional series of public meetings will be held. The first will
   seek comment before finalizing a recommended plan. The second will be
   held when the plan is completed, prior to its submission to Congress.
