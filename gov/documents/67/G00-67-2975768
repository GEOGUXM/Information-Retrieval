   [clearspc.gif] Reign of Terror

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 13— Congressman Eric Cantor (R-Virginia), the Chairman
   of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional
   Warfare, delivered the following statement in response to the Osama bin
   Laden tape released today.

   "The tape aired today has made it abundantly clear that Osama bin Laden
   relies on the use of terror for his power. Not only has bin Laden
   enacted terror on the American people but he uses terror to maintain
   support and power within his own radical community.

   "Bin Laden’s attempt during the videotaped meeting to belittle the
   American people and exaggerate the fear instilled through the September
   11 attacks demonstrate that bin Laden stakes his reputation upon being
   an instrument of severe terror.

   "These tapes are a window into Osama bin Laden’s mentality and into the
   hatred and violence that drives terrorism. We know other terrorists
   exist, and we have to assume they could be strengthened by the
   knowledge that bin Laden remains alive and committed to his cause.

   "Bin Laden is a terrorist that must be pursued at all costs. I applaud
   the Bush Administration and the men and women of our armed forces for
   the successes they have had in America’s war against terrorism. The
   Taliban’s rule over Afghanistan is coming to an end.

   "However, bin Laden’s terrorist activity is undergirded by a large,
   international support system. America will need to take the war on
   terrorism into any state or area that maintains infrastructure
   supporting international terrorist activity.

   "The American people’s resolve is strong, our war against terror is
   proving to be successful, and the way of democracy will prevail."
