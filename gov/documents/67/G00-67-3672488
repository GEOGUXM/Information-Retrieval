   Identity Theft Heads the FTC's Top 10 Consumer Fraud Complaints of 2001

   Identity theft headed the top 10 consumer fraud complaints of 2001,
   according to the Federal Trade Commission. Identity theft accounted for

   Sentinel database last year. The top 10 list of consumer fraud
   complaints includes:
    1. Identity Theft (42%)
    2. Internet Auctions (10%)
    3. Internet Services and Computer Complaints (7%)
    4. Shop-at-Home and Catalog Offers (6%)
    5. Advance Fee Loans and Credit Protection (5%)
    6. Prizes/Sweepstakes/Gifts (4%)
    7. Business Opportunities and Work at Home Plans (4%)
    8. Foreign Money Offers (4%)
    9. Magazines and Buyers Clubs (3%)
   10. Telephone Pay-Per-Call/Information Services (2%)

   "Consumers who report their complaints to the FTC are helping law
   enforcement find and stop rip-off artists," said Howard Beales,
   Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. "The complaints in
   the Consumer Sentinel database are a valuable tool for state and
   federal consumer protection agencies that investigate and prosecute
   fraud."

   Consumers can file a fraud complaint with the FTC by calling toll-free
   1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357) or online at www.ftc.gov. Consumers can
   file identity theft reports by calling 1-877-ID THEFT (1-877-438-4338).

   Consumer Sentinel is a central database collecting complaints from more
   than 50 law enforcement and private sector partners. Leading data
   contributors include the National Fraud Information Center, Canada's
   Phonebusters, the Internet Fraud Complaint Center, and numerous local
   Better Business Bureaus. Consumer Sentinel is also a secure online
   cybertool and fraud complaint database that helps more than 400 law
   enforcement agencies fight fraud. Leading law enforcement partners in
   this effort include the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the U.S. Secret
   Service, the FBI, and the National Association of Attorneys General.

   The FTC has tips to help consumers who want to protect themselves from
   fraud and deception:
     * Protect your personal information. It's a valuable commodity. Only
       share your credit card or other personal information when you're
       buying from a company you know and trust.
     * Know who you're dealing with. Walk away from any company that
       doesn't clearly state its name, physical address and telephone
       number. A Web site alone or a mail box drop should raise
       suspicions.
     * Don't rely on oral promises. Get all promises in writing and review
       them carefully before you make any payments or sign any contracts.
       Read and understand the fine print in any written agreement.
     * Don't pay "up-front" for a loan or credit. Remember that legitimate
       lenders never "guarantee" a loan or a credit card before you apply,
       especially if you have bad credit, no credit, or a bankruptcy.
