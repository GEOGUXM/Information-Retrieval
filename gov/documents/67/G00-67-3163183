                              Benefits of Trade
                          (released Sept 19, 2001)


   The two major trade agreements of the 1990s -- the North American Free
   Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Uruguay Round -- have been responsible
   for annual gains of between $1,260 and $2,040 for the average American
   family of four. Zoellick released the materials in response to a
   Freedom of Information Act request filed by Public Citizen's Global
   Trade Watch, a Washington-based advocacy group with a history of
   opposition to free trade.
