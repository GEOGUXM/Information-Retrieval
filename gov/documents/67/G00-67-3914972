           Program Office of the types of activities engaged in by their CDG
           which may be of interest to and shared with other CDGs. The CDG
           Individual Biographical Information Worksheet is to be completed by
           PMIs prior to the Orientation and submitted to the PMI Program
           Office. This form allows the Advisor to learn more about the PMI. It
           should facilitate both networking and planning for group activities.
           The CDG Advisor Nomination Form is to be completed by federal
           executives, GS 14 and above, who are interested in serving as an
           Advisor to a Career Development Group of 20 to 25 PMIs during their
