Research In Progress

                            [blue_green_line.gif]

   Research conducted by the Biology and Biotechnology Research Program is
   driven by investigator-initiated DOE/OHER funded projects, work for
   other federal agencies (including NIH), internal laboratory
   discretionary funding, and industrial partnerships. It is focused on
   three strategic thrust areas: genomics, disease susceptibility and
   prevention, bioengineering research. These thrust areas provide a set
   of core compentencies and a foundation for our laboratory-wide
   strategic plan in the biosciences.
   Genomics
   Molecular and Structural Biology
   Countering Bioterrorism
   Bioengineering Research
