                              Mission Statement
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Marine Prediction Center (MPC) is an integral component of the
   National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) located at the
   NOAA Science Center in Camp Springs, MD. The primary responsibility is
   the issuance of marine warnings, forecasts, and guidance in text and
   graphical format for maritime users. Also, the MPC quality controls
   marine observations globally from ship, buoy, and automated marine
   observations for gross errors prior to being assimilated into computer
   model guidance. The Marine Prediction Center also provides forecast
   points in coordination with the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for
   Tropical Cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean E of 65W.

   MPC originates and issues marine warnings and forecasts, continually
   monitors and analyzes maritime data, and provides guidance of marine
   atmospheric variables for purposes of protection of life and property,
   safety at sea, and enhancement of economic opportunity. These products
   fulfill U.S. responsibilities with the World Meteorological
   Organization and Safety of Life at Sea Convention (SOLAS)
   [International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960 and
   1974].

   In emergency situations MPC acts as a backup to the Tropical Prediction
   Center (TPC) taking over the marine functions of TPC.
    I. Areal extent: Region of coverage is the over marine areas of the
       Northern Hemisphere S of 67N to 15 degrees S (except Indian Ocean).
   II. Temporal extent: Guidance and forecasts are issued for time periods
       where useful skill exists out to 96 hours for seas and 120 hours
       for weather systems.
   III. Application activities: Conducted to support the civilian maritime
       community and other government agencies in support of safety of
       life at sea , ie. U.S. Coast Guard.
   IV. Product suite: Support for transoceanic, fishing, and recreational
       marine users, coastal communities, marine navigation, and other
       marine interests.
    V. Product distribution: Direct support for all national and
       international marine users. MPC produces principal guidance for
       National Weather Forecast Offices with offshore and coastal
       responsibilities, and other marine related programs.

   Both graphical and text products are disseminated covering these
   geographical regions: synoptic scale coverage over the entire North
   Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, and mesoscale coverage for the
   coastal and offshore portions of the eastern and western United States.

                           Radiofacsimile Schedule

   In addition to being available online through the Marine Prediction
   Center homepage, the graphical products described below are transmitted
   directly to vessels at sea and the public along coastal areas via High
   Frequency (HF) short-wave radiofacsimile through transmitters of the
   U.S. Coast Guard at Marshfield, MA, and Point Reyes, CA. The Coast
   Guard transmits these products at scheduled times throughout the day.
     * Atlantic Ocean
     * Pacific Ocean

                         Short wave Radio Broadcast

   Also, a brief version of the High Seas Forecast (HSF), which covers the
   North Pacific Ocean E of 140W and North Atlantic W of 35W is broadcast
   via High Frequency (HF) short-wave radio station, WWV in Fort Collins,
   Colorado. The Atlantic forecast is broadcast in two parts at HH+08 and
   HH+09 minutes. The Pacific forecast is broadcast at HH+10 minutes.
   These warnings and forecasts are updated every six hours at 0500 UTC,
   1100 UTC, 1700 UTC, and 2300 UTC. WWV transmits on 2.5 MHz, 5.0 MHz,
   10.0 MHz, 15.0 MHz, and 20.0 MHz continuously 24 hours a day. In
   addition WWV marine broadcasts can be heard at these times at (303)
   499-7111.

   A typical warning text format is as follows:

   North Pacific Weather east of 140W at 1800 UTC October 11 1995

   ...Warning forecasts....
   By 24 hours Gale 56N 138W moving NE 25 knots with winds to 40 knots
   seas to 24 feet within 900 nautical miles south and southeast
   quadrants.

   ...Other forecasts....
   Low 39N 127W moving ENE 25 knots. Winds to 30 knots seas to 14 feet
   within 480 nautical miles south semicircle.
   End Of Message.

                             Graphical Products

   Two types of graphical products are disseminated. The analysis and
   forecasts of upper level large synoptic scale flow are based on a
   computer objective scheme. The surface analysis and forecast charts are
   produced from a blend of objective and subjective means as determined
   by a marine forecaster. Times indicated on the charts are in
   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). There are two major categories of
   charts broadcast.
    1. Surface
       These manually produced charts depict surface features and forecast
       positions, and define present and future wind and wave conditions.
    2. Upper Air
       These are depictions of the computer model analyses and forecasts
       of ridges and troughs for the 500 mb constant pressure surfaces.

                                Text Products

   The High Seas Forecast (HSF), which covers the North Atlantic Ocean and
   North Pacific Oceans is issued four times per day. The text describes
   initial synoptic scale conditions. The forecast describes conditions of
   winds/seas associated with significant weather features of concern to
   Mariners out to 36 hours. It can include areas of dense fog and
   structural icing.

   Also, two Offshore forecast products are issued which describe current
   and forecast features for the offshore waters of the Western and
   Eastern US coasts.  The Marine Interpretation Message (MIM) based on
   the latest forecast model runs are issued four times a day, and
   describe forecast reasoning for the 24 hr graphics products and the
   offshore forecast for the next 48 hours.
