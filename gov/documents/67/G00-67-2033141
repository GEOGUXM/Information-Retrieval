   Magnified carbon particles A correlated sensor network being developed
   at Livermore can help fight nuclear terrorism and other threats.
   Magnified carbon particles Cleaner, more efficient power from these
   carbon particles is possible with direct carbon conversion.
   Computer simulation of protein Pulses from 192 laser beams will
   converge in this aluminum-alloy target chamber of the National Ignition
   Facility.
   Computer simulation of protein The world's most accurate lathe was
   built to form large, irregularly shaped mirrors for experimental
   lasers.
   Computer simulation of protein Computer modeling is being used to help
   determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins.
   Vacuum chamber experiment Vacuum chamber experiments and computer
   simulations help predict the performance of advanced materials.
   Livermore researcher and imaging station at the end of a proton
   beamline Scientists are exploring use of protons instead of x rays to
   create radiographic images for studies of nuclear weapons.
   "Data gloves" electronically attached to a computer workstation allow a
   user to reach out and seemingly move 3-D objects.
   Spectrometer dedicated to biological studies Accelerator mass
   spectrometry is being used to solve many challenges in biomedicine.
   Russian images Lawrence Livermore experts are helping to secure nuclear
   materials and weapons know-how in the former Soviet Union.
   Computer Simulation of neutron transport A supercomputer was used to
   create the largest-ever three-dimensional simulation of neutron
   transport.
   Biological agents Quick and reliable detection of agents likely to be
   used in biological weapons is crucial for response to biological
   warfare.
