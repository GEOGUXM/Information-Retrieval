       During calendar year 1999, 1,033 LLNL publications were listed in
   the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Science Citation Index
   (SCI), a database that indexes the contents of the major science and
   technology journals. ISI developed the concept of citation indexing -
   that is, counting as well as indexing the references or papers that a
   publication includes. SCI is the only database where you can find how
   often a paper has been cited and exactly what publications did the
   citing. According to the ISI database, LLNL publications have appeared
   in more than 300 different journals. The top ten journals listed by ISI
   for 1999 and for the cumulative period, 1981-1999, are shown in the
   table "Top Ten Journals in which LLNL Papers were Published."
   Proceedings of the International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE)
   published more LLNL papers both in the single year 1999 and in the
   cumulative years 1981-1999 than did the other refereed journals.

       Papers published by LLNL scientists and engineers in 1999 represent
   60 subject areas. The top ten subjects of these papers are shown in the
   table "Top Ten Subject Areas of Publication," where the 1999 totals can
   be compared with the cumulative top ten. The table shows that the
   subject areas "Physics" and "Applied Physics/Condensed Matter/Materials
   Science" placed first and second in the 1999 list and in the cumulative
   1981-1999 list.

       Because citation indexing is a cumulative process, most journal
   articles do not receive many citations the year they are published. In
   1999, 194 LLNL papers were cited one or more times. To date, the most
   cited 1999 LLNL publication is Akerlof, et al., " Observations of
   contemporaneous optical radiation from a gamma-ray burst," in Nature,
   which has received 17 citations to date.

       A list of the most frequently cited LLNL papers from 1981-1999 is
   shown in the table "Top Ten Most Cited Papers." The table that follows
   - "Total Citations Received by LLNL Papers by Journal" - lists the
   1981-1999 citations of LLNL papers by the publishing journal. The ISI
   database has recorded that LLNL papers published in Physical Review
   Letters were the most frequently cited - 21,511 citations between 1981
   and 1999. The "impact factor" refers to data calculated by ISI. An IF
   gives the average number of citations received by a paper in that
   journal for a year.

       The final table - "Average Number of Citations to LLNL Papers by
   Journal" - lists the top twenty journals according to the average
   number of citations per LLNL paper.
