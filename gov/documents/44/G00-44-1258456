   Indiana, and Wisconsin.

   The Upper Illinois River Basin in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin is
   one of more than 50 study units that are part of the U.S. Geological
   Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program. The
   long-term goals of this program are to describe the status and trends
   in the quality of a large, representative part of the Nation's surface-
   and ground-water resources, and to provide a sound, scientific
   understanding of the primary factors affecting the quality of these
   resources.

   The Upper Illinois River Basin (UIRB) study began in 1997 and was one
   of the NAWQA Pilot studies from 1986 to 1992.
