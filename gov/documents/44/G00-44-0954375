   JASMINE

   [ronbrown2.jpg] Monsoon circulations cause phenomenal seasonal
   variations of precipitation in some of the planet's most heavily
   populated regions. The ability to predict the timing and intensity of
   monsoons is of huge importance to the well-being of nations in these
   areas and is also important to understanding global climate conditions.
   The Joint Air-Sea Monsoon Investigation (JASMINE) is a multi-agency
   study of the Asian-Australian monsoon system. A pilot study in 1999
   will use the NOAA research vessel Ron Brown and will be followed by the
   main experiment in 2000. The project will examine the dynamical and
   thermodynamical connections of the upper ocean and the lower atmosphere
   in the northern Indian Ocean where maximum seasonal variations in
   precipitation occur. The ship will be the moving platform for a variety
   of scientific in-situ and remote sensor instruments, including ETL's
   millimeter-wave cloud radar (MMCR) package which includes microwave and
   infrared radiometers in addition to the high-sensitivity 35-GHz radar
   designed for cloud observations. The ship's instruments will measure
   interactions between the ocean surface and the atmospheric boundary
   layer, in conjunction with research aircraft and buoy-mounted probes in
   the area.
