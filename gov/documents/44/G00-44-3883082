   Commuting Hours and Zones

   The scheduled trip time and how many zones you travel affect how much
   you pay.

   During peak commuting hours - Monday to Friday, 6-9 a.m. and 3-6 p.m. -
   adults pay slightly more than during non-peak hours. These peak fares
   are based on a trip's scheduled times, not its actual arrival times.
   Peak trips are indicated with shaded areas on the individual paper
   timetables. Fares for all other riders are the same price all day.

   What is a zone at Metro? The City of Seattle is one zone and all other
   areas outside the city, but within King County, are a second zone. Any
   time you cross the Seattle city limits, you have passed from a one-zone
   fare to a two-zone fare. Any time your trip begins or ends on a zone
   line, a one-zone fare is charged.

      Regional Transfer

      If you board Metro Transit and pay your fare using cash, Metro tickets
      or a Metro pass, you can request a transfer from your driver when you
      pay your fare. Your transfer is valid for between one hour and thirty
      minutes (1:30) and one hour and fifty-nine minutes (1:59). Your valid
      transfer will be accepted on Community Transit, Everett Transit, Pierce
      Transit or Sound Transit for a local base fare, regardless of how many
      zones you paid for on Metro Transit. Depending on when and where you
      travel on those systems, an additional fare might be required.

      A valid transfer from Community Transit, Everett Transit, Pierce
      Transit, or Sound Transit can be used as payment for a one zone fare on
      Metro Transit, regardless of how much you paid on the other system. If
      you are an adult and want to travel two zones during the peak period,
      an additional fifty cents ($0.50) will be required.

      How to Pay

      Deposit money or bus tickets into the farebox. The farebox accepts
      coins and paper currency. Drivers do not carry cash, so please have the
      exact fare ready. If you use a Metro pass or PugetPass, run it through
      the pass reader on the farebox. If your pass does not have a magnetic
      strip on the back, simply show it to the driver.

      If you need to change buses to get to your final destination, ask the
      driver for a transfer when you pay. Transfers are valid on any Metro
      bus or the Waterfront Streetcar for about one hour after they are
      issued.

      On buses traveling into downtown Seattle, pay your fare as you board.
      On buses traveling out of downtown Seattle, pay when you exit.
