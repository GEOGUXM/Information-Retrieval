   For thousands of years, Mankind regarded comets as bearers of evil
   tidings. Only in the last few hundred years with the invention of the
   telescope and spectroscope have astronomers been able to show that
   comets are essentially big clumps of ice and dust. But our
   understanding of comets has been limited by our inability to physically
   gather samples. Deep Impact will yield a dramatic breakthrough in our
   understanding of comets with the first experiment to sample deeply
   below the surface of a comet.

   What are Comets? What do we know about the target comet 9P/Tempel 1?
   What are the Science Objectives? Who is Observing Tempel 1 and how can
   I observe it? The answers to these questions can be found within this
   section. In addition, you can meet the Science Team and ask them
   questions!

   How did the Deep Impact Mission get its name? Find out from mission
   team member Alan Delamere.
