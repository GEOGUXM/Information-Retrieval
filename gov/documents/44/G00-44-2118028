      Our marine sanctuaries provide a vast array of visual splendors that
      enthrall young and old alike. But, many of the most striking scenes lie
      well below the water's surface, experienced only by advanced divers.
      This photo gallery is intended to share some of these visual delights
   with a broader community.

   To prepare this photo gallery, staff members at each sanctuary were
   asked to present the sanctuary's visual story. A draft script was
   prepared. Local photographic collections were searched to select the
   best examples. New photos were shot when necessary. Professional
   wildlife photographers donated many of the photographs. We thank them
   for these contributions.

   Currently, we offer collections for the following sanctuaries: Gulf of
   the Farallones, Cordell Bank, Channel Islands, Monterey Bay, Olympic
   Coast, Stellwagen Bank, Gray's Reef, Florida Keys, Flower Garden Banks,
   Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale, Fagatele Bay and Monitor.

   The National Marine Sanctuary's Photo Gallery contains hundreds of
   selected photo images arranged into one of five categories for each of
   the twelve sanctuaries. The five categories are; (1) The Living
   Sanctuary; (2) Habitats; (3) People and the Sanctuary; (4) The
   Sustainable Seas Expeditions (selected sanctuaries only) ; and (5) The
   Kids Gallery (selected sanctuaries only) . The images selected best
   represent the sanctuary and its purpose for desgination. Each image is
   accompanied by a short description. We recommend browsing the images
   within their sanctuary categories in order to get a better idea of the
   sanctuary as a whole.

The Categories

   The Living Sanctuary includes images of the most notable or common
   plants and animals found in the sanctuary. Sanctuaries harbor a
   fascinating array of plants and animals, from the great whales to tiny
   krill. Many of these organisms provide essential services to the
   sanctuary ecosystem, which are necessary for the sanctuary's overall
   health. Many of the annotations describe the relationship between the
   organisms depicted on the image and the sanctuary's biological and
   physical processes.

   Habitats includes images of some of the major habitat types found
   within the sanctuary. Most of the sanctuaries are made up of a number
   of different major habitats. Examples include: rocky inter-tidal, kelp
   forest, coral reef, deep water shelf, and shallow sea grass to name a
   few. Some habitats change not only due to the physical composition of
   the bottom, but also along the different depth and temperature layers
   found in portions of the sanctuary. The annotations describe the
   habitat depicted on the image and its important function within the
   sanctuary.

   People and the Sanctuary includes images, which represent how humans
   use, and have used the sanctuary area. Examples are fishing,
   recreation, shipping, research, and ceremonial uses. Images found in
   this section may depict uses by humans during the pre-Columbian era up
   to our present uses. The annotations describe the human use(s) depicted
   on the image, and how those uses affect or have affected sanctuary.

   The Sustainable Seas Expeditions includes images taken during the 1999
   Sustainable Seas Expeditions sponsored by National Geographic Society,
   NOAA, and the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund. Images for this category
   are not available for all the sanctuaries. To learn more about the
   project, visit NOAA's Sustainable Seas Expeditions Web site.

   The Kids Gallery includes drawings, paintings, collages, poems and
   other creations by children in kindergarten through 8th grade.
   Sanctuary education coordinators have selected the kids' creations.
   These images represent a view of the sanctuary from a child's
   perspective. Images for this category are not available for all the
   sanctuaries.

   NOAA provides all the materials on this site in public domain. You may
   download and use any images or kids' poems in the gallery, as long as
   any source information is not removed.
