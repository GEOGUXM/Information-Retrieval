   Background and Statement of Issues

   Residents of the community of Mossville in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana,
   are concerned about current exposures to releases from neighboring
   chemical manufacturing plants.

   The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) conducted
   an Exposure Investigation (EI) which measured the blood dioxin
   (chlorinated dibenzodioxins [CDDs] and chlorinated dibenzofurans
   [CDFs]) levels of some residents [1]. This investigation showed
   elevated dioxin levels. To rule out current exposures as the cause of
   these elevated levels, ATSDR, its public health partners, and the
   community want to characterize the air pathway by conducting
   appropriate air sampling. This consultation uses dispersion modeling
   and seasonal weather patterns to identify optimal sampling locations.

   Site Description and History

   Dioxin may be emitted by any of several industrial facilities located
   in Calcasieu Parish. Calcasieu Parish contains a large number of
   manufacturing plants that produce chemicals such as chlorinated
   hydrocarbon solvents, vinyl chloride monomer, and petroleum-based
   chemicals. Chemical wastes from some of these industrial operations are
   burned in hazardous waste incinerators. Small amounts of dioxin are
   formed during the production of vinyl chloride [2], by the incineration
   of chlorinated hydrocarbon wastes, and during the regeneration of
   catalysts used in petroleum refining.

   Mossville is located across the road from a large vinyl chloride
   monomer (VCM) plant. Several flares at this facility intermittently
   burn unidentified materials. A representative of the plant reported
   that the flares do not burn chlorinated hydrocarbons or other materials
   that contain chlorine. The plant also has two incinerators for
   chlorinated compounds that burn only gaseous vents from the VCM unit
   process. These incinerators have been sampled according to EPA methods
   and reportedly emit less than 0.1 grams of total dioxin per year.

   ATSDR has conducted an EI to determine if there was evidence for
   increased exposure to dioxins in residents of Mossville. Blood samples
   were collected from 28 residents of the community and were analyzed for
   chlorinated dibenzodioxins, chlorinated dibenzofurans, and co-planar
   polychlorinated biphenyls. The results of these samples indicated that
   blood dioxin in the EI participants were higher than a reference
   population.

   Methods

   A successful air sampling plan optimizes the possibility of both
   detecting the chemical and identifying its source. Air dispersion
   models allow scientists to optimize both of these objectives.

   Air dispersion modeling was used to assist with the design of an air
   sampling plan. The air dispersion modeling will illustrate the
   transport of each facilities' air emissions. A diagram of the plume
   transport will provide scientists with conditions which prevent plumes
   from overlapping. When plumes do not overlap, the source of the
   emissions are more easily identified.

   In an effort to evaluate dioxin exposures though air, it is essential
   to use the benefits of air dispersion modeling as well as atmospheric
   sampling. This review of the available data will assist with
   implementing the air sampling plan.

   ATSDR requested an independent contractor (through the interagency
   agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental
   Response Team [ERT] in Edison, NJ) to use meteorologic data collected
   at Lake Charles to model the plumes from the five chemical facilities
   nearest to Mossville to provide the plume impact locations.

   Since the source content and magnitude is unknown, modeling only
   provides maximum impact zones of plumes. Should one of the plumes
   contain dioxin along with other chemicals, it may be identified through
   a sampling regime which includes: (1) sampling at the ideal locations
   identified in the modeling results; (2) measuring meteorologic data
   concurrent with the sampling; and (3) reconstructing the specific plume
   path after the samples are analyzed.

   Results

   A report of the modeling results is attached. The implications are
   illustrated in Figures 1- 12 which delineate the maximum impact regions
   for each month. Only a few unique wind directions will allow scientists
   to find the responsible source of the dioxin if it is found in the
   downwind samples. It is critical to consider the seasonal winds as well
   as the sampling locations to optimize sampling. The unique wind
   directions that will produce impacts that allow us to determine the
   responsible sources are illustrated in Figures 13 - 15.

   Discussion

   The results from the modeling indicate that climate produces a few
   unique locations to optimize sampling goals. The locations that receive
   maximum plume impact are depicted on each of the figures. The figures
   can be used to site samplers to optimize the possibility of detecting
   dioxin from the potential sources.

   Conclusions

   1. Models indicate that emissions from the 5 closest facilities can be
   transported by the wind into Mossville (See Figures 1-12, for each
   month's relative impact).

   2. Mossville is well-situated to detect emissions from the 5
   facilities.

   3. Model predicted impact zones indicate ideal sites in Mossville for
   locating samplers to discern the effects of emissions from each of the
   5 facilities.

   4. Meteorological conditions exist that will enable scientists to
   distinguish the source of chemicals unique to each of the facilities
   (See Figures 13 - 15).

   Recommendations

   1. Sample within the area between Mossville's 3^rd and 8^th Streets.

   2. Consult the figures to help select sampling locations suitable for
   each season.
     * Collect meteorologic data during sampling.
     * If dioxin is detected, model the specific transport scenario to
       determine the source.
