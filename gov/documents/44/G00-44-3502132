   photo of USGS office The Pasadena USGS Office conducts research and
   spacer promotes activities to reduce earthquake hazards in southern
   California. The Office works with Caltech and the California Division
   of Mines & Geology (CDMG) operating the TriNet seismic network to
   monitor earthquake activity and provide information for earthquake
   response.

   The Office works with JPL and Scripps Institution of Oceanography
   operating the Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN) to
   continuously monitor crustal movements.

   The Office Outreach & Education Program works collaboratively with the
   Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) on some O&E projects.
