USFA RELEASES PRELIMINARY FIREFIGHTER FATALITY STATISTICS FOR 2001

   EMMITSBURG, Md. - The United States Fire Administration (USFA)
   announced today that 441 firefighters died while on-duty in the United
   States in 2001. This total, which is more than four and one-half times
   the average annual number of firefighter deaths for the last decade,
   includes 343 firefighters lost at the World Trade Center on September
   11. The loss represents the worst total since the USFA began tracking
   firefighter fatalities in 1977. USFA is a part of the Federal Emergency
   Management Agency.

   "2001 was a tragic year for Americas fire service," R. David Paulson,
   United States Fire Administrator, said. "In addition to the many local
   heroes who died serving their communities nationwide, the eyes of the
   world turned to New York City on September 11."

   "The USFA is committed to helping firefighters and fire departments
   respond more safely to emergencies that occur in their communities.
   Terrorism has changed our world forever but the traditional killers of
   firefighters are still around."

   In 2001, firefighters fatalities were reported in 86 communities in 33
   states. These totals are provisional and may change as additional
   information about firefighter fatalities is received.

   The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11 that
   claimed the lives of 343 members of the Fire Department City of New
   York (FDNY) is the worst single incident loss of firefighter lives in
   history.

   There were eight incidents in 2001 where more than one firefighter was
   killed; two of these tragedies occurred in New York City. In addition
   to the World Trade Center losses, three firefighters were killed in the
   explosion of a hardware store in New York City on Fathers Day. Other
   firefighters lost during the line of duty include the following:
     * Four wildland firefighters were killed in July when they were
       trapped by rapid-fire progress in a forest fire in Washington
       State.
     * Three firefighters were killed in the crash of a firefighting
       helicopter in Montana during August.
     * Two firefighters were killed when two firefighting aircraft
       collided in midair while fighting a wildfire in California during
       August.
     * A total of 14 firefighters died in association with wildfire
       incidents.
     * Two Illinois firefighters were killed when they were trapped in the
       basement of a burning structure in February.
     * Two Missouri firefighters were killed when they were trapped by
       rapid-fire progress in a residential fire in March.
     * Two Pennsylvania firefighters drowned as they attempted to recover
       the body of a boater.
     * 79 single firefighter fatality incidents.

   Career firefighters, those who are employed full-time as firefighters,
   comprised 370 deaths (83.9 percent) in 2001. Volunteer, seasonal, and
   part-time firefighters accounted for 71 deaths. Twelve of the 71 were
   seasonal or part-time wildland firefighters.

   The vast majority of firefighter fatalities in 2001 occurred on the
   scene of a fire incident with 384 deaths in the category (343 were the
   result of the World Trade Center collapse). The balance of fatalities
   occurred as follows:
     * Twenty firefighters died as they responded to an emergency or
       returned from one; many of these deaths involve vehicle collisions.
     * Eleven deaths occurred during training.
     * Three firefighters died at the scene of non-fire emergencies such
       as the two Pennsylvania firefighters who drowned during a water
       recovery.
     * One firefighter died of a heart attack just after the conclusion of
       an emergency incident.
     * Twenty-two firefighters engaged in other fire department duties at
       the time of their death occurred in 2001.
     * An Ohio firefighter struck and killed by a falling section of a
       tree while testing fire hydrants is an example of this type of
       incident.

   Heart attacks continue to be a leading cause of firefighter deaths,
   killing 39 firefighters in 2001. The 39 deaths represent 8.8 percent of
   the 2001 total. This percentage rises to 40 percent when the massive
   number of FDNY firefighters is excluded from the calculation.

   The largest number of firefighter fatalities by month occurred in
   September with 352 deaths. The lowest number of firefighter fatalities
   by month occurred in November and December with three deaths in each
   month.

   The USFA contacts state fire marshals at the beginning of each year to
   verify the names of firefighters reported to have died on-duty during
   the previous year and expects to have the annual fatality report
   completed by early June.
