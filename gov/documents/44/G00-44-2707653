   With their unique life histories, anadromous fishes require special
   consideration in understanding their biology and developing management
   strategies. During the Industrial Revolution, many populations of
   anadromous fishes were severely depleted or extirpated by damming,
   pollution or alteration of their migratory or spawning habitats. Some
   measures were taken in the late 1880s to provide access for anadromous
   fishes around dams by construction of rudimentary fishways, or by
   stocking fish into habitats that historically supported large runs.
   However, without a complete understanding of the ecology, life history
   and environmental needs of these species, many of these efforts failed
   to restore naturally reproducing populations within their original
   ranges. With the passage of the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act of
   1965, the federal government took an active role in assisting states in
   their anadromous fish enhancement efforts. However, the need for
   information about anadromous fish biology and ecology continues, and is
   critical to the success of these programs. The S.O. Conte Anadromous
   Fish Research Center (CAFRC) has been charged to meet this need to
   perform research directed towards restoration and protection of
   anadromous fishes. In recent years fishery agency needs have expanded
   to include provision of fish passage facilities for many riverine
   species. CAFRC has expanded its mission to include work on any riverine
   migratory species.


Research Mission and Priorities

   CAFRC is a branch of Leetown Science Center, Kearneysville, West
   Virginia, within the U.S. Geological Survey-Biological Resources
   Division, Department of the Interior. The focus of research at CAFRC is
   to perform both basic and applied research relative to biological and
   management concerns regarding anadromous fish populations and their
   associated ecosystems. Priorities include research leading to
   restoration and enhancement of anadromous fishes, environmental and
   resource consequences from dams or altered ecosystems, and effective
   fish passage research and development. CAFRC performs research in four
   major areas, with substantial interaction between scientists in each
   area to maintain an interdisciplinary approach to solving problems in
   anadromous fish biology and management.


Core Capabilities

     * Fish Physiology - Methods for study of osmoregulatory and endocrine
       systems.
     * Fish Behavior - relationship with functional capacity to negotiate
       passage designs; field behavior as it relates to population
       sustainability.
     * Fish Ecology - Exploring patterns and mechanisms of fish population
       dynamics, habitat use, genetics, and growth.
     * Engineering Research - basic and applied research in hydraulics and
       fish passage.
     * Fish Passage Biology - basic and applied research into fish
       migration and passage behavior, and the evaluation of passages to
       enhance upstream and downstream movement of anadromous and
       migratory species .


   Anadromous fishes studied at the lab-

   First, what's an anadromous fish? Fish that spawn in freshwater and
   live in seawater.
