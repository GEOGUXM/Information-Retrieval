   Smog Information

   When is a smog inspection required?

   Smog inspections are required for all vehicles except diesel powered
   vehicles, motorcycles, or 1973 and older year models. Vehicles
   registered in areas subject to the biennial smog certification program
   are required to submit evidence of a smog certification every other
   renewal period. Vehicles that are four model years old or less are
   exempt from the biennial smog requirements for registration renewal.
   Evidence of a current smog certification must be provided by the seller
   except when transfer occurs between a spouse, sibling, child, parent,
   grandparent, or grandchild. Smog certifications are good for 90 days
   from the date of inspection. The inspection is not required on a
   transfer if a biennial smog certification was submitted to DMV within
   60 days prior to the vehicle transfer date.

   How old does a vehicle have to be to qualify for a smog exemption?

   1973 and older year model vehicles are exempt from the smog
   certification requirements.

   When a car is sold, who is responsible for the inspection?

   The seller is required to provide the buyer with a valid smog
   inspection certification at the time of the sale or transfer. Smog
   certifications are good for 90 days from the date of inspection. The
   inspection is not required on a transfer if a biennial smog
   certification was submitted to DMV within 60 days prior to the vehicle
   transfer date.

   What if my car fails the inspection?
