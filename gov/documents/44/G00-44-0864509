     Welcome to the Environmental Restoration (ER) Project web site. I
     hope you find the information presented within useful and relevant to
     your needs.

                                                                Julie Canepa

    The Los Alamos National Laboratory was founded in 1943 as part of the
   Manhattan Project, which was to develop the first atomic weapon. During
    this time, the disposal of hazardous chemical and radioactive wastes
    was not regulated and therefore some of these materials were disposed
                               of improperly.

      The mission of the Environmental Restoration Project is to remedy
    environmental problems caused by 50 years of Laboratory operations by
   bringing together multi-disciplinary, world-class science, engineering,
                 and state-of-the-art management practices.
                         The Project's goals are to:
     * protect human health and the environment from exposure to
       hazardous, radioactive, and mixed wastes from past treatment,
       storage, and disposal practices and
     * meet the environmental cleanup requirements of the Laboratory's
       permit to operate hazardous waste facilities.
