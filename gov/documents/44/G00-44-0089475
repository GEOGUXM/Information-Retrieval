             The Future At Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory
            _____________________________________________________

   [seprl.jpg] The future at SEPRL will directly reflect the future needs
   of the poultry industry, which will continue to face infectious disease
   problems for years to come. As such, the ARS response through research
   units such as SEPRL must continue to meet both basic and applied
   research needs. The recent outbreak of avian influenza in Mexico and in
   Hong Kong are prime examples of the unpredictability of avian pathogens
   and the need for sustained federal funding of research programs to
   address national and international disease issues. Particularly
   important are those issues that impact the poultry industry in
   international trade, economic viability, and food safety. The SEPRL
   research mission will continue to focus on providing science-based
   solutions to poultry health and food safety problems.

   Specific research efforts will include:
    1. Finding ways to prevent the introduction of, and to eliminate
       exotic and emerging infecious diseases such as avian influenza,
       Newcastle disease, and poult enteritis mortality syndrome.
    2. Conducting needed basic and applied research to reduce the risk of
       Salmonella enteriditis in poultry products.
    3. Developing and utilizing an enhanced understanding of mucosal
       immunity to formulate new vaccines and intervention strategies to
       prevent diseases of the respiratory and digestive tracks.
    4. Developing engineering controls to reduce poultry diseases and
       improve air quality.

   The Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory's continued responsiveness to
   regulatory agencies and industry concerns reflects the basic attitude
   of the scientific and support staff to remain open and positive in
   their efforts. The more than 180 publications by SEPRL scentists in
   respected peer reviewed journals in the 90's alone reflect the
   laboratory's continued awareness of, and diligence at finding answers
   to the infectious disease problems presented to the poultry industry.
