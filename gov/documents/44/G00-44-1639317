   MBNMS Webpage History and Development

   September, 1992 - MBNMS Designated - As a condition of the MBNMS
   designation document and Management Plan, it was intended that one of
   the first goals of the MBNMS program would be to create a "Site
   Characterization" document. Such a document would be an in-depth
   description of the environment, ecology, history and social settings of
   the MBNMS. Creation of such a document was desired by the local
   research and education community.

   October, 1994 - Site Characterization Contract Awarded - MBNMS awards
   MLML Researchers a $100,000 contract to develop an MBNMS Site
   Characterization Document.

   January, 1995 - Contract to UCSC Web Publishing Class - The MBNMS
   awarded $1,000 to the UCSC Web Publishing class to post a temporary
   MBNMS Web page.

   February, 1995 - Prototype MBNMS Web Page at UCSC - - Dr. Marti
   Atkinson and a group of UCSC students set up a prototype MBNMS Webpage
   at UCSC on "sapphire."

   April, 1995 - MBNMS Internet Connection - The MBNMS became hooked up to
   the internet via a 128k Frame Relay line. The hookup was
   part-and-parcel of a volunteer regional educational/public service
   effort put on by a consortium of local organizations, including UCSC,
   called "I3LA".

   April, 1995 - Webberization of Site Characterization - The MBNMS
   awarded an additional $25,000 to the Site Characterization project for
   the purpose of making the document accessible in electronic form over
   the internet.

   May, 1995 - MBNMS Web Page Transferred to MBNMS Domain

   April, 1995 - Additional UCSC Web Design Contract for $1200

   March, 1996 - Unveiling of MBNMS Site Characterization - At the annual
   MBNMS Research and Education Symposium, the MBNMS Site Characterization
   was unveiled. The final document was placed on the MBNMS Web page in
   May, 1996.

   August, 1996 - NOS Award - MBNMS Webpage wins "Best NOS Website" Award
   at 1st Annual "NOS WebShop".

   October, 1996 - Additional UCSC Web Design Contract for $2400.

   March, 1997 - Infopoint - The Santa Cruz Company "Infopoint" offers to
   donate the time and expertise to give the MBNMS Website a new and
   improved look, thereby creating Version 2.0.

   January, 1998 - Version 2.0 - MBNMS Webpage Version 2.0 unveiled!
