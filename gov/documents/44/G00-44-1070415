   Senate Legislative Calendar
   The Senate's Legislative Calendar is updated each day the Senate is in
   session. The calendar, composed of several sections, identifies bills
   and resolutions awaiting Senate floor actions. Most measures are placed
   on the calendar under the heading "General Orders" in the sequence in
   which they were added to the calendar. Other sections are provided to
   address special situations in which floor actions have been deferred
   and to show the status of bills in conference and of appropriations
   bills.

   At the top of each document linked below is a brief description of the
   specific focus and content of that section of the Senate Legislative
   Calendar.

   Identifies the title and date of the Senate's Calendar of Business
   (Legislative). Items of pending and unfinished business are also
   described. Pending business represents measures or motions taken up by
   the Senate but not yet disposed of. Pending business becomes unfinished
   business when the Senate reconvenes following an adjournment to begin a
   new legislative day.
