   William E. Tanner
   Clerk of Court

   I feel that one of the most important goals of any organization is that
   it provide its customers easy access to timely, accurate, relevant
   information. It's something that we have strived to do in the past and
   we pledge that we will always pursue this goal aggressively. Therefore,
   it is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the home page of the
   United States Bankruptcy Court, Middle District of Georgia. We hope
   that you find the information published here to be both interesting and
   useful.

   In the last few years, the Internet has made information available on a
   tremendous scale and we are committed to using state-of-the art
   technology to aid us in conducting the business of the court. This site
   is an exciting example of that commitment. Although still in a
   developmental stage, this site can be used by the public, the bar, the
   media and others and can provide access to data quickly, conveniently
   and on a scale we've never before attempted.

   As you might expect, we are starting small. And as with any new
   project, we expect that we may encounter problems as we work to expand
   and refine both the information included and its format. We encourage
   you to use the site often and participate in its development by letting
   us know what you see that is valuable and by offering your suggestions
   for improvement. Please submit your comments and suggestions to
   webmaster@gamb.uscourts.gov.

   Again, welcome!
