      TravInfo

   The Bay Area Traveler Information System

      For more information, visit the TravInfo® Web site

   Purpose of Program

      TravInfo® is a comprehensive system to gather, organize and disseminate
      timely information on San Francisco Bay Area traffic and road
      conditions, public transit routes and schedules, carpooling, highway
      construction and road closures, van and taxi services for disabled
      travelers, park-and-ride facilities, and bikeways.

      Its purpose is to help motorists avoid congestion and to encourage the
      use of public transit and ridesharing services by giving Bay Area
      travelers easy access to information, enabling them to choose the most
      appropriate modes, times and routes to reach their destinations.

      The information is provided free-of-charge to travelers via a single
      phone number: 817-1717. TravInfo® provides current road information 24
      hours a day, seven days a week. In addition, the service provides
      direct connections to 24 public transit operators and 20 van and taxi
      services for travelers with disabilities.

      TravInfo® was selected for funding by the U.S. Department of
      Transportation as a field operational test in 1993, one of 16
      intelligent transportation systems (ITS) projects so designated
      nationwide. The concept of ITS is that better management of existing
      transportation systems through state-of-the-art data collection and
      communications technologies will help the U.S. to maintain its mobility
      without continuing to build new infrastructure.

   Organization

      TravInfo® is implemented through a flexible partnership of public
      agencies, research institutions and private firms. The public sector
      provides an open-access database of both traffic and public transit
      information, while the private sector will offer products and services
      that present this information in convenient and innovative forms.

      The project is under the day-to-day direction of a project management
      team, and the overall direction of a Management Board composed of the
      Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) -- the transportation
      planning, financing and coordinating agency for the nine-county Bay
      Area -- the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) District
      4, and the Golden Gate Division of the California Highway Patrol (CHP),
      as well as five ex-officio member organizations, including the Federal
      Highway Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, and
      California Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways (PATH), the
      University of California's ITS research and development institution.

      The primary vehicle for the ongoing relationship between the public
      sector and private firms is the TravInfo® Information Service Provider
      (ISP) Forum, which is made up of representatives of roughly 90 firms,
      research institutions and public agencies. Currently 53 of these
      organizations are also "registered participants" of TravInfo®, which
      will develop new products and services for travelers based on TravInfo®
      data.

   Funding

      The Bay Area has a total of $9.7 million to implement and operate the
      system over the course of a two-year field test, and to evaluate its
      effectiveness. The bulk of this is $5.2 million in federal Congestion
      Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program and ITS funds, for which
      Caltrans provided an $880,000 match. The remaining $2.4 million
      comprises various federal, state and local funds for related projects.
      In addition, project partners have made in-kind contributions worth
      $1.2 million.

   Timeline


   1993 Project gets under way. Institutional, financial and
        organizational structure is established. Consultants are retained.
   1996 Field operational test (FOT) period begins. TravInfo® starts to
        make real-time traffic information available through the already
        existing regional transportation telephone number.
   1998 FOT phase ends. TravInfo® transitions from a demonstration project
        to a fully deployed system.

   See the TravInfo® site for more information about the 817-1717 phone
   number.
