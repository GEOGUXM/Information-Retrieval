   You can navigate to Section E.4 by following these steps:
   Go to the DOE Information Bridge page http://www.osti.gov/bridge
    1. Click the Advanced Search button (or go to
       http://gpo.osti.gov/bridge/dds/advanced.html, the Advanced Search
       page.)
    2. Search the Field Identifying Number for Document Number DE97001461
    3. Select the text link for the document.

   Note that DOE's Information Bridge is incorrectly configured. If you
   use the PDF link on their page, the file may not download and open
   correctly.

   Also Note this is a 50 MB file. Download times will be very long, even
   on a fast connection.

   The other alternative is to view individual page images. When you have
   reached the result of step 4 (above), you will see a window of page
   numbers at the bottom of the browser window. Select page numbers from
   this list. Appendix E: Epidemiology Section is found on pages 425 -
   443.
