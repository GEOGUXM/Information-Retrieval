                 New Report Questions Statistical Adjustment

   WASHINGTON A new report issued today by the Congressional Members of
   the U.S. Census Monitoring Board examines the scientific methodology
   behind statistical adjustment.
   The 2000 census was the most accurate census in history, said board
   Co-Chair A. Mark Neuman.  With the dramatic reduction in the
   differential undercount compared to 1990, one can see why the
   professionals at the Census Bureau chose not to recommend the use of
   statistically adjusted numbers.  In the coming weeks and months we will
   be studying to what extent statistical adjustment would have put
   persons missed in the census back into the neighborhoods where they
   were missed, he said.  We must not only attempt to count everyone
   living in America, we must make sure they are counted at the correct
   address.
   There are other considerations we feel everyone should understand about
   the statistical adjustment methodology, Neuman continued.  Among these
   are the roles of post-strata and adjustment factors in adjustment, and
   how data from just 800 people in one type of area (e.g. large
   metropolitan areas) could have been used to adjust data for millions of
   people nationwide.
   Board member Dr. David Murray also commented on the assumptions behind
   statistical adjustment.  Adjusting the count of certain areas with data
   for persons from radically different areas is scientifically
   problematic, and that is what adjustment would do, he said.  Adjusting
   data for persons from New York City with data from persons in Miami and
   Seattle has troubling implications, especially when there are important
   geographic dimensions in the use of census data.
   Other geographic examples are highlighted in the report, including that
   of the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, whose data would be adjusted
   with data from other Native American tribes, such as the Oneida Nation
   in New York.
   The U.S. Census Monitoring Board is a bipartisan panel created by
   Congress to oversee all aspects of the 2000 Census.  This report was
   produced by the congressionally appointed members.  Information
   regarding the Census Monitoring Board and the 2000 census can be found
   on our web page at www.cmbc.gov.
