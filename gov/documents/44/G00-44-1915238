   A plat is a parcel of land that has been divided into lots, blocks,
   streets, etc.
   Most cemeteries are also platted.

   Not all land in Sedgwick County is platted.

   Instructions:

   Search for plat by name.  Search for plat by Drawer.

   Step 1:

   Example 1

   You can type in the name as W BERRY ADDITION (the search is not case
   sensitive), then click on the submit button. There will be occasions
   that this type of search will not work because of spelling or
   abbreviations that have been used. For these instances see the next
   example.

   Example 2

   If you are uncertain of the exact or complete plat name, then the
   recommended search method is as follows: %berry. Please take note of
   the percent symbol. The percent symbol are referred to as wildcards in
   some database searches. In this case, you are telling the search engine
   that you want to look for something that includes the word berry, and
   the search engine will return all plat names that include the word
   berry. The name W BERRY ADDITION would be included in this list.

   Step 2:

   Select plat.

   From the list titled subdivision names, find the desired plat and click
   on the corresponding drawer number (highlighted in blue).

   Step 3:

   Select download method.

   You now have the option of opening this file from its current location
   or saving it to disk.


   Step 1:

   Example

   Enter the letters of the drawer you are searching for.

   Legal drawers are:
   A, B, C, CEM, D, E, F, G, H, I (for IJK), L, M (or M1, M2, MC), N (for
   N & O), PC, PQ (or P for PC & PQ), R, S, T (for TUV), W, X (for XY &
   Z).

   J, K, U, V, Y, and Z are not legal drawer letters and will not return
   any plats.

   Letters M and P are not legal drawer letters, but queries submitted
   with these two letters will return results because the letters 'M' and
   'P' are sub-sets of legal drawer letters.

   M1, M2 or MC will return a sub-set of the results of using only the
   letter 'M.'

   PC or PQ will return a sub-set of the results of using only the letter
   'P.'

   Step 2:

   Select plat.

   Select the plat from the list titled subdivision names, find the
   desired plat and click on the corresponding drawer number (highlighted
   in blue).

   Step 3:

   Select download method.

   You now have the option of opening this file from its current location
   or saving it to disk. Selecting either choice will require downloading
   the file to your hard drive.

   Selecting 'Save this file to disk' allows you to choose the folder to
   save the plat file. This option makes finding the plat file easier to
   locate when you attempt to insert the file into Microsoft Word or the
   graphics application you use to open and print TIF files.

   Selecting 'Open this file from it's current location' saves the file on
   your hard drive under a temporary file name and opens the plat file
   with your default TIF viewer.
