   United States Court of Appeals United States Court of Appeals FOR THE
   DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT No. 00-5212 September Term, 2000 98cv01232
   98cv01233 Filed On: August 17, 2001 [618306] United States of America,
   Appellee v. Microsoft Corporation, Appellant
   __________________________________________ Consolidated with 00-5213
   BEFORE: Ginsburg, Chief Judge; Edwards, Williams, Sentelle, Randolph,
   Rogers, and Tatel, Circuit Judges O R D E R Upon consideration of the
   motion to stay the mandate, the response thereto, and the reply, it is
   ORDERED that the motion be denied. In order to obtain a stay of the
   mandate pending its petition for certiorari, Microsoft must show that
   the "petition would present a substantial question and that there is
   good cause for a stay." See Fed. R. App. P. 41(d)(2)(A); see also D.C.
   Cir. Rule 41(a)(2) (movant for stay of mandate must provide "facts
   showing good cause for the relief sought"). For the reasons stated in
   the appellees' response to the motion for stay, it appears that
   Microsoft has misconstrued our opinion, particularly with respect to
   what would have been required to justify vacating the district court's
   findings of fact and conclusions of law as a remedy for the violation
   of 28 U.S.C. ยง 455(a). We need not decide, however, whether Microsoft's
   objections constitute a "substantial question" likely to lead to
   Supreme Court review, because Microsoft has failed to demonstrate any
   substantial harm that would result from the reactivation of proceedings
   in the district court during the limited pendency of the certiorari
   petition. See Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S.
   1, 24 (1974); Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Ass'n v. Federal Power
   Commission, 259 F.2d 921, 925 (D.C. Cir. 1958). The Clerk is directed
   to issue the mandate seven days from the date of this order. See Fed.
