     Travel Management System
     bluebar.gif (3614 bytes)
     The Travel Management System (TMS) is the Department of Health and
     Human Services premier travel system. Managed by the Program Support
     Center (PSC), this system manages the travel process from travel
     order, through supervisory approvals, to voucher processing and
     payment. The system uses an electronic in-box approach for the
     approval process and access to the system is via TCP/IP. Once a
     traveler is given a user id and password, the system is accessible
     from any workstation that has internet access.

     If you would like more information on TMS, please email Bill Boyle
