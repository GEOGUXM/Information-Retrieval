   Sequence Analysis with your Web Browser
   Now with either Netscape (4.04 or later), or Internet Explorer (4.0 or
   l ater), and an account at the ABCC, you can have easy access to GCG's
   sequence a nalysis tools through SeqWeb.
   If you've been discouraged from using GCG's command line interface,
   which can be complex and yet very powerful, you should give SeqWeb a
   try. SeqWeb will allow you to focus on analyzing your sequence rather
   than how to use the software. Just go to SeqWeb and login in with your
   ABCC username and password. Then it's just POINT, CLICK, PULL-DOWN,
   HIGHLIGHT, CUT, and PASTE to use this comprehensive set of
   bioinformatic tools.
   FEATURES:
     * Access to ABCC's daily updated nucleotide and protein databases.
     * On-line tutorial from the Introduction button.
     * Sequence Manager allows you retrieve sequences from a database, a
       clipboard or you own local file.
     * Save results as a local file either as text or HTML.
     * Select size of graphics to best fit your display.

   Many additional features make SeqWeb quick and easy to use. If you have
   an ABCC account and want to try SeqWeb, or would like to apply for an
   ABCC account, contact our HELP DESK at 301-846-5555 or send email to
   helpuser@ncifcrf.gov.
