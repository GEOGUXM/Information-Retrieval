BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
                            _____________________

   The United States submits this brief as an amicus curiae, pursuant to
   28 U.S.C. § 517 and Rule 29(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate
   Procedure, to address the effect of the immunity provision of the Audio
   Home Recording Act of 1992, 17 U.S.C. § 1008.

STATEMENT OF INTEREST

   The United States Copyright Office is charged by statute with the
   responsibility to provide Congress, federal agencies, and the courts
   with "information and assistance * * * on national and international
   issues relating to copyright * * * ." 17 U.S.C. § 701(b)(1)-(2). The
   United States Patent and Trademark Office is charged with advising the
   President and all federal agencies "on matters of intellectual property
   policy in the United States * * * ." 35 U.S.C. § 2(b). Consistent with
   these statutory provisions, the United States participates as an amicus
   curiae to provide courts with the views of the federal government,
   including the Copyright Office and the Patent and Trademark Office,
   regarding significant copyright and other intellectual property issues.

   Although this case presents a number of important issues, one issue in
   particular implicates the roles of the Copyright Office and the Patent
   and Trademark Office -- the operation and effect of the Audio Home
   Recording Act of 1992 ("AHRA" or "Act"). The Copyright Office plays a
   central role in the administration of the Act. See 17 U.S.C. §§
   1003(b)-(c), 1005, 1007, 1009(e). Moreover, the Copyright Office and
   the Patent and Trademark Office provided Congress with advice and
   assistance during the legislative deliberations leading to the
   enactment of the Act. For these reasons, the United States believes
   that the government's views regarding the scope and application of the
   Act's immunity provision may assist the Court in the resolution of that
   issue.

STATEMENT OF ISSUES

   Whether Section 1008 of the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, 17 U.S.C.
   § 1008, excuses Napster from liability for copyright infringement.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE

A. The Audio Home Recording Act of 1992

   The Audio Home Recording Act is Congress's response to a controversy
   between the music industry and the consumer electronics industry
   regarding the introduction of digital audio recording technology into
   the domestic consumer market. The Act represents an effort to resolve
   that controversy through a carefully developed and finely balanced
   legislative compromise. See generally H.R. Rep. No. 873(I), 102d Cong.,
   2d Sess. 11-13 (1992) ("House Report"), reprinted in 1992 U.S. Code
   Cong. & Admin. News ("USCCAN") 3581-3583; S. Rep. No. 294, 102d Cong.,
   2d Sess. 30-45 (1992) ("Senate Report").

   Beginning in the 1980s, consumer electronics firms began to develop
   tape recorders and other consumer recording devices that employ digital
   audio recording technology. Unlike traditional analog recording
   technology, which results in perceptible differences between the source
   material and the copy, digital recording technology permits consumers
   to make copies of recorded music that are identical to the original
   recording. Moreover, a digital copy can itself be copied without any
   degradation of sound quality, opening the door to so-called "serial
   copying" -- making multiple generations of copies, each identical to
   the original source.

   The capability of digital audio recording technology to produce perfect
   copies of recorded music made the technology attractive to the consumer
   electronics industry, which anticipated substantial consumer demand for
   tape recorders and other recording devices equipped with digital
   recording technology. However, the same capability was a source of
   concern to the music industry, which feared that the introduction of
   digital audio recording technology would lead to a vast expansion of
   "home taping" of copyrighted sound recordings and a corresponding loss
   of sales.

   When digital audio recording technology first became available for the
   consumer market, the legality of home taping of copyrighted sound
   recordings was a subject of ongoing controversy between the music
   industry and the consumer electronics industry. See House Report at
   11-12, reprinted in 1992 USCCAN at 3581-3582; Senate Report at 31. In
   Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984), the
   Supreme Court held that the use of VCR recording technology by
   consumers to make home copies of broadcast programs for viewing at
   another time ("time-shifting") constituted a non-infringing "fair use"
   of the copyrighted material. The consumer electronics industry,
   together with consumer groups, argued that Sony recognized a general
   right to engage in home taping of copyrighted materials for personal
   use; the music industry argued that Sony was decided on narrow grounds
   and did not give the Court's general imprimatur to home taping.

   In 1990, music publishers and songwriters filed a class action suit for
   copyright infringement against Sony Corporation, which had begun to
   market DAT (Digital Audio Tape) recorders. During the course of the
   litigation, negotiations were undertaken to develop a general
   non-judicial solution to the digital audio recording controversy. The
   recording industry, recording artists, songwriters, music publishers,
   the consumer electronics industry, and consumer groups all participated
   in the negotiations. Senate Report at 33 & n. 16.

   The negotiations culminated in 1991 in a compromise agreement among the
   interested parties, which was presented to Congress as the basis for
   legislation. The AHRA embodies the essential terms of that compromise.
   See House Report at 13, reprinted in 1992 USCCAN at 3583; Senate Report
   at 33-34. The compromise involves a basic quid pro quo between the
   music industry on the one hand and the consumer electronics industry
   and consumers on the other.

   The AHRA provides the music industry with two principal benefits
   relating to digital audio recording technology. First, the Act requires
   manufacturers of "digital audio recording devices" to incorporate
   circuitry that prevents serial copying. 17 U.S.C. §§ 1001(11), 1002.
   Second, the Act requires manufacturers of "digital audio recording
   devices" and "digital audio recording media" to pay prescribed
   royalties into a fund that is distributed to copyright holders. Id. §§
   1003-1007. The royalty payment system is administered by the Copyright
   Office. Id. §§ 1005, 1007.

   In exchange for these benefits, the AHRA provides manufacturers and
   consumers with prescribed statutory immunity from suits for copyright
   infringement. This immunity is contained in Section 1008 of the Act, 17
   U.S.C. § 1008, which provides:

   No action may be brought under this title alleging infringement of
   copyright [1] based on the manufacture, importation, or distribution of
   a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an
   analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or [2] based on
   the noncommercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for
   making digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings.

   By its terms, Section 1008 disallows two kinds of actions for copyright
   infringement. The first are actions "based on the manufacture,
   importation, or distribution" of the specified recording devices and
   recording media. The second are actions "based on the noncommercial use
   by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical
   recordings or analog musical recordings." Section 1008 bars any action
   for copyright infringement "under this title" -- Title 17 of the United
   States Code -- based on these activities.

B. The Present Litigation

   In December 1999, the plaintiffs brought this action for copyright
   infringement against Napster in the Northern District of California.
   Napster is a centralized service that greatly simplifies and expands
   the ability of Internet users to copy MP3 music files from other
   persons' computers. It does so by providing a "virtual meeting place"
   where an individual user of the Napster system can find MP3 music files
   on the hard drive of other computers participating, at that moment, in
   the Napster "community." Napster then facilities the direct
   "peer-to-peer" copying and transfer of those files.

   In general terms, the plaintiffs asserted that consumers who use
   Napster's Internet- based service and software to exchange sound files
   containing copyrighted musical recordings are engaged in copyright
   infringement and that Napster is liable for contributory infringement
   and vicarious infringement.

   Napster denied that its users are engaged in infringement or that its
   own actions make it liable for contributory or vicarious infringement.
   In addition, Napster asserted a number of affirmative defenses. Among
   those is a defense based on Section 1008 of the AHRA. Napster argued
   that the activities of its users are immunized by Section 1008 and
   that, as a consequence, Napster itself cannot be held liable for
   contributory or vicarious infringement.

   On July 26, 2000, the district court issued an opinion and order
   granting a preliminary injunction against Napster. The district court
   concluded, inter alia, that Napster's users are engaged in extensive
   copyright infringement and that Napster is contributorily and
   vicariously liable for their actions. The district court dismissed
   Section 1008 as "irrelevant to the instant action" because the
   plaintiffs were not seeking relief under the AHRA. ER 04266 (Opinion p.
   42 n.19).

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

   Section 1008 of the Audio Home Recording Act does not protect Napster
   from the plaintiffs' claims of copyright infringement. Section 1008 was
   adopted to address a very different phenomenon -- the noncommercial
   consumer use of digital audio recording devices, such as DAT tape
   decks, to perform "home taping" of musical recordings. Napster's effort
   to bring itself within the ambit of Section 1008 flouts the terms of
   the statute and conflicts with the basic policies of the Act.

   1. Section 1008 prohibits actions for copyright infringement based on:
   (1) the manufacture, importation, or distribution of "a digital audio
   recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording
   device, or an analog recording medium"; or (2) "the noncommercial use
   by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical
   recordings or analog musical recordings." Although Napster insists that
   the activities of its users are protected by Section 1008, and that it
   therefore cannot be held accountable for contributory or vicarious
   infringement based on those activities, Napster's defense cannot
   possibly be squared with the actual terms of Section 1008.

   First, it is undisputed that Napster's users are not using any "device"
   or "medium" specified in Section 1008, and Section 1008 applies only to
   consumer use of "such a device or medium." Second, when Napster's users
   create and store copies of music files on their computers' hard disks,
   they are not making "digital musical recordings or analog musical
   recordings" as those terms are defined in the Act. Third, Napster's
   users are engaged not only in copying musical recordings, but also in
   distributing such recordings to the public, and Section 1008 immunizes
   only noncommercial copying ("noncommercial use * * * for making digital
   musical recordings or analog musical recordings"), not public
   distribution. Fourth, unlike such copyright provisions as the fair use
   provision (17 U.S.C. § 107), Section 1008 does not designate any use of
   copyrighted works as non-infringing; it merely bars "action[s] * * *
   alleging infringement" based on such uses. Assuming arguendo that
   Napster's users are otherwise engaged in acts of copyright
   infringement, nothing in Section 1008 purports to render those actions
   non- infringing, and hence the claims against Napster for contributory
   and vicarious infringement would remain unaffected even if Section 1008
   did apply to Napster's users.

   2. The AHRA was intended by Congress to embody a compromise between the
   music industry on the one hand and the consumer electronics industry
   and consumer groups on the other. At the heart of that compromise is a
   quid pro quo: in exchange for allowing noncommercial consumer use of
   digital audio recording technology (Section 1008), the music industry
   receives financial compensation (Sections 1003-1007) and protection
   against serial copying (Section 1002). Permitting Napster to shelter
   itself behind Section 1008 would defeat this basic statutory quid pro
   quo: Napster's users would be permitted to engage in digital copying
   and public distribution of copyrighted works on a scale beggaring
   anything Congress could have imagined when it enacted the Act, yet the
   music industry would receive nothing in return because the products
   used by Napster and its users (computers and hard drives) are
   unquestionably not subject to the Act's royalty and serial copying
   provisions.

   Napster asserts that, despite the precision of the language in Section
   1008, Congress actually meant to provide immunity for all noncommercial
   consumer copying of music in digital or analog form, whether or not the
   copying fits within the terms of Section 1008. Nothing in the
   legislative history of the Act supports that argument.

   And nothing in RIAA v. Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc., 180 F.3d 1072
   (9th Cir. 1999), the decision on which Napster places principal
   reliance, supports the argument either. Section 1008 was not at issue
   in Diamond Multimedia, and nowhere does the case hold that Section 1008
   provides the kind of omnibus immunity for digital copying that Napster
   invokes here.

ARGUMENT

SECTION 1008 OF THE AUDIO HOME RECORDING ACT OF 1992 DOES NOT EXCUSE NAPSTER
FROM LIABILITY FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT

   Napster asserts that Section 1008 of the Audio Home Recording Act
   provides its users with immunity from liability for copyright
   infringement and, in so doing, relieves Napster itself from any
   derivative liability for contributory or vicarious infringement. The
   district court was correct to reject that defense. Napster's invocation
   of Section 1008 is flatly inconsistent with the terms of the statute
   and the legislative policies that underlie the AHRA. Accordingly, if
   Napster is otherwise liable under the copyright laws, Section 1008 does
   not relieve Napster of liability. ^1
     __________________________________________________________________

   ^1This brief does not address or express a view regarding any issue in
   this case other than the AHRA issue. For purposes of addressing the
   AHRA issue, the United States assumes that the plaintiffs have made out
   an otherwise valid claim for contributory and/or vicarious copyright
   infringement against Napster based on the use of Napster's service and
   software by consumers to exchange computer files containing copyrighted
   musical works.

   We note that one of the amici participating in this appeal is a former
   Register of Copyrights, Ralph Oman. As a former Register, Mr. Oman
   speaks for himself and his client rather than the Copyright Office.
     __________________________________________________________________

A. Napster's Immunity Defense Is Foreclosed by the Plain Language of Section
1008

   "The 'starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the
   statute itself. '"Exxon Mobil Corp. v. United States Environmental
   Protection Agency, 217 F.3d 1246, 1249 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting
   Consumer Product Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102,
   108 (1980)). Napster's discussion of Section 1008 is notably selective
   about following this rule. Napster correctly points out that the
   introductory language of Section 1008 -- "[n]o action may be brought
   under this title alleging infringement of copyright" -- makes Section
   1008 potentially applicable to any infringement action under Title 17,
   not just an action under the AHRA itself. But Napster conspicuously
   fails to address the remaining language of Section 1008, and makes no
   effort to explain how that language can be read to protect Napster's
   users or Napster itself.

   Napster's reluctance to come to grips with the statutory language is
   understandable, because the activities of Napster's users do not even
   arguably come within the terms of the statute. Not only does the
   language of Section 1008 foreclose Napster's immunity defense, but it
   does so in four separate and independent ways. Napster's argument thus
   depends on a wholesale disregard of what Section 1008 actually says.

1. Napster's Users Are Not Using Any of the "Devices" or "Media" Covered by
Section 1008

   Section 1008 identifies four specific kinds of products whose
   manufacture, distribution, and noncommercial use Congress wished to
   shield from actions for copyright infringement. Those products are "[1]
   a digital audio recording device, [2] a digital audio recording medium,
   [3] an analog recording device, or [4] an analog recording medium." 17
   U.S.C. § 1008. Section 1008 prohibits actions for copyright
   infringement based on "the manufacture, importation, or distribution"
   of these four types of devices and media. Section 1008 also prohibits
   actions for copyright infringement based on "the noncommercial use by a
   consumer of such a device or medium" for making digital or analog
   musical recordings.

   Nothing in the language of Section 1008 purports to grant
   manufacturers, distributors, or consumers any immunity with respect to
   products other than the devices and media specified in Section 1008
   itself. To the contrary, if an action for infringement does not involve
   the specified devices or media, it falls outside the scope of Section
   1008 altogether. By its terms, Section 1008 protects consumers only
   from infringement actions that are based on "noncommercial use * * * of
   such a device or medium" (emphasis added). If an infringement action
   rests on consumer use of other products, Section 1008 on its face has
   no applicability to such an action.

   In this case, the plaintiffs' copyright claims are not based on the use
   of any of the devices or media covered by the terms of Section 1008.
   Napster's users exchange music by using personal computers to locate
   and transfer files from one computer hard disk to another. Neither a
   personal computer nor its hard disk constitutes "a digital audio
   recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording
   device, or an analog recording medium." Napster itself does not suggest
   otherwise.

   The terms "digital audio recording device" and "digital audio recording
   medium" are specifically defined in the Act. A "digital audio recording
   device" is defined, with exceptions not relevant here, as any machine
   or device "the digital recording function of which is designed or
   marketed for the primary purpose of, and that is capable of, making a
   digital audio copied recording for private use." 17 U.S.C. § 1001(3)
   (emphasis added). A "digital audio recording medium" is defined (again
   with inapplicable exceptions) as "any material object * * * that is
   primarily marketed or most commonly used by consumers for the purpose
   of making digital audio copied recordings by use of a digital audio
   recording device." Id. § 1001(4)(A) (emphasis added).

   This Court has already held that the statutory definition of "digital
   audio recording device" does not reach personal computers and their
   hard drives. RIAA v. Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc., 180 F.3d 1072,
   1078 (9th Cir. 1999). Although personal computers are "capable of"
   making "digital audio copied recordings," neither they nor their hard
   drives are "designed or marketed for the primary purpose of" making
   such recordings. Ibid. For similar reasons, hard drives fall outside
   the statutory definition of "digital audio recording medium," since
   they are not "primarily marketed or most commonly used * * * for the
   purpose of" making such recordings.

   Unlike "digital audio recording device" and "digital audio recording
   medium," the terms "analog recording device" and "analog recording
   medium" are not expressly defined in the Act. Congress presumably had
   in mind the analog counterparts to digital audio recording devices and
   media -- for example, traditional analog tape decks and analog
   recording tapes. Whatever the precise scope of these terms, however,
   they cannot encompass personal computers and their hard drives, because
   computers process and store information in digital rather than analog
   form. Thus, Napster users are not even arguably using any of the
   devices and media referred to in Section 1008.

2. Napster's Users Are Not Making "Digital Musical Recordings" Or "Analog
Musical Recordings"

   Section 1008 protects the noncommercial consumer use of digital and
   analog recording devices and media for making "digital musical
   recordings or analog musical recordings." 17 U.S.C. § 1008. Even if
   Napster's users were using the specified devices or media, they are not
   making "digital musical recordings" or "analog musical recordings."
   Their activities fall outside the scope of Section 1008 for that reason
   as well.

   The Act defines a "digital musical recording" as "a material object * *
   * in which are fixed, in a digital recording format, only sounds, and
   material, statements, or instructions incidental to those fixed sounds,
   if any * * * ." 17 U.S.C. § 1001(5)(A)(i) (emphasis added). The
   definition goes on to exclude, among other things, "a material object *
   * * in which one or more computer programs are fixed * * * ." Id. §
   1001(5)(B)(ii).

   Napster's users copy music files to their computers' hard drives. Hard
   drives store data of all kinds, from word processing files to
   multimedia files, and they ordinarily store computer programs as well.
   As a result, hard drives fall outside the statutory definition of
   "digital musical recording" in two respects: first, they are not
   objects in which "only sounds" are "fixed," and second, they are
   objects in which "one or more computer programs are fixed." See Diamond
   Multimedia, 180 F.3d at 1076 ("a hard drive is a material object in
   which one or more programs are fixed; thus, a hard drive is excluded
   from the definition of digital musical recordings").

   Unlike "digital musical recording," "analog musical recording" is not a
   defined term under the Act. However, just as a computer's hard drive
   cannot be an "analog recording medium" (see p. 15 supra), neither can
   it be (or be used to store) an "analog musical recording," because hard
   drives store data in digital rather than analog form. Thus, Napster's
   users cannot be claimed to be making either "digital musical
   recordings" or "analog musical recordings" -- and if a consumer is not
   making a digital or analog musical recording, the terms of Section 1008
   do not provide him with any immunity.

3. Section 1008 Provides Immunity Only for Noncommercial Copying, Not for
Public Distribution

   The Copyright Act grants the owner of a copyright a number of distinct
   legal rights. See 17 U.S.C. § 106(1)-(5). The most widely known right
   is the right of reproduction -- the "exclusive right * * * to reproduce
   the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords." Id. § 106(1). However,
   the Copyright Act also grants the copyright holder a separate and
   distinct right of public distribution -- the "exclusive right * * * to
   distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public
   by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
   lending." Id. § 106(3).

   The plaintiffs assert not only infringements on the right of
   reproduction, but also infringements on the right of public
   distribution. In the proceedings below, Napster stated that it has at
   least 20 million users, all of whom are able to use Napster's service
   to access and download music files containing copyrighted sound
   recordings. When a Napster user makes the music files on his or her
   hard drive available for downloading by other Napster users, he or she
   is distributing the files to the public at large. Cf. Michaels v.
   Internet Entertainment Group, Inc., 5 F. Supp. 2d 823, 830-31 (C.D.
   Cal. 1998); Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Webbworld, Inc., 991 F. Supp.
   543, 551 (N.D. Tex. 1997), aff'd mem., 168 F.3d 486 (5th Cir. 1999);
   Marobie-Fl, Inc. v. Nat'l Ass'n of Fire and Equip. Distributors and
   Northwest Nexus, Inc., 983 F.Supp. 1167, 1173 (N.D. Ill. 1997).

   To the extent that Napster users are engaged in the distribution of
   copyrighted works to the public at large, such activity falls outside
   the scope of Section 1008. The language of Section 1008 is directed at
   uses that infringe on the right of reproduction, not at uses that
   infringe on the right of public distribution. By its terms, Section
   1008 only bars infringement actions "based on the noncommercial use" of
   the specified products "for making digital musical recordings or analog
   musical recordings" -- in other words, for making copies of the music.
   Section 1008 makes no reference, and provides no possible defense, to
   infringement claims based on the public distribution of copied works.
   Thus, even if it were proper to treat the use of Napster's service for
   the public dissemination of copyrighted music as a "noncommercial"
   consumer use, which is far from clear, it is not the use at which the
   terms of Section 1008 are directed -- the "making [of] digital musical
   recordings or analog musical recordings." ^2

4. Section 1008 Does Not Transform Infringing Consumer Uses Into
NonInfringing Ones

   As the foregoing discussion shows, the language of Section 1008 cannot
   be read to encompass the activities of Napster's users. But even if
   Section 1008 did apply to Napster's users, it would not provide Napster
   itself with a defense to liability for contributory or vicarious
   infringement. That is because the terms of Section 1008 address only
   whether consumers can be sued for infringement; nothing in Section 1008
   addresses or changes whether they are engaged in infringement.
     __________________________________________________________________

   ^2 We should not be understood to suggest that every distribution of a
   copyrighted work, regardless of its scope or attendant circumstances,
   is necessarily an infringement of the statutory right of distribution.
   The right of distribution conferred by 17 U.S.C. § 106(3) is a right of
   public distribution -- the right "to distribute copies or phonorecords
   of the copyrighted work to the public" (emphasis added). See 2 Melville
   B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 8.11[A] (1999).
     __________________________________________________________________

   When Congress has chosen to make particular uses of copyrighted works
   noninfringing, it traditionally has said so expressly. For example, the
   fair use provision of the Copyright Act provides that "the fair use of
   a copyrighted work * * * is not an infringement of copyright." 17
   U.S.C. § 107 (emphasis added). Congress has spoken with equal clarity
   regarding other uses. See, e.g., id. § 108 ("it is not an infringement
   of copyright" for library or archive to reproduce single copies of
   works under specified conditions); id. § 110 (specified performances
   and displays of works "are not infringements of copyright"); id. § 117
   ("it is not an infringement" for owner of copy of computer program to
   make an additional copy for, inter alia, archival purposes).

   In contrast, Section 1008 of the AHRA conspicuously does not say that
   the activities it describes "are not an infringement of copyright."
   Instead, Section 1008 provides only that "[n]o action may be brought
   under this title alleging infringement of copyright" based on such
   activities. The legislative record indicates that this language
   reflects a deliberate decision by Congress to relieve consumers from
   the threat of copyright liability without altering the underlying
   contours of the copyright laws or resolving the legal debate over the
   legality of home taping. In the words of the Senate Report:

   [S]ection 1002 [now Section 1008] provides only that certain copyright
   infringement actions are precluded. The section does not purport to
   resolve, nor does it resolve, whether the underlying conduct is or is
   not infringement. The committee intends the immunity from lawsuits to
   provide full protection against the specified types of copyright
   infringement actions, but it has not addressed the underlying copyright
   infringement issue * * * .

   Senate Report at 52 (emphasis added).

   Thus, assuming for present purposes that Napster's users are engaged in
   copyright infringement, their actions would remain infringing even if
   Section 1008 were applicable to them, since Section 1008 does not
   purport to address the underlying issue of infringement. And if Section
   1008 does not transform the actions of Napster's users into
   non-infringing uses, then it cannot provide shelter to Napster itself.
   In invoking Section 1008, Napster has argued that it cannot be liable
   for contributory or vicarious infringement if its users are not
   themselves engaged in infringement. Once it is recognized that Section
   1008 does not alter whether the consumer uses that it addresses are
   infringing, Napster's argument falls apart.

   It is noteworthy in this regard that Section 1008 expressly provides
   immunity not only for the specified noncommercial consumer use of
   digital and analog recording devices and media, but also for the
   manufacture and distribution of such products. Napster's argument
   assumes that the immunity conferred on consumers is sufficient by
   itself to preclude liability for contributory or vicarious infringement
   on the part of the firms whose products are being used. But if that
   were the case, then there would have been no reason for Congress to
   include distinct immunity protection for manufacturers in Section 1008
   itself, and the manufacturer immunity language in Section 1008 would
   serve no purpose. Napster's argument thus conflicts with the elementary
   principle that "legislative enactments should not be construed to
   render their provisions mere surplusage." Dunn v. CFTC, 519 U.S. 465,
   472 (1997). The fact that Congress found it necessary to extend an
   express statutory grant of immunity to manufacturers, as well as to
   consumers, confirms that Congress did not regard consumer immunity from
   suit as sufficient by itself to insulate other parties from liability
   for contributory or vicarious infringement.

B. Napster's Reliance on Section 1008 Is Inconsistent With the Policies
Underlying the AHRA

   In Diamond Multimedia, this Court observed that it "need not resort to
   the legislative history [when] the statutory language is clear." 180
   F.3d at 1076. Given the clarity with which the language of Section 1008
   prescribes (and circumscribes) the scope of statutory immunity under
   the AHRA, and given Napster's manifest inability to bring this case
   within the language of the statute, resort to the legislative history
   of the AHRA is therefore unnecessary. Nevertheless, if recourse is had
   to the legislative history, it reinforces the conclusion that Section
   1008 does not protect Napster. Far from advancing the policies of the
   AHRA, Napster's invocation of Section 1008 is directly contrary to
   those policies.

1. Napster's Invocation of Section 1008 Upsets the Quid Pro Quo That
Underlies the Act

   The legislative history of the AHRA makes clear that the Act was
   intended by Congress to embody the compromise agreement reached in 1991
   between the music industry on the one hand and the consumer electronics
   industry and consumer groups on the other. See, e.g., Senate Report at
   34 (" the competing parties have, through negotiation and compromise,
   reached an agreement which all parties involved feel is equitable," and
   the legislation "reflects this agreement"); House Report at 13,
   reprinted in 1992 USCCAN at 3583 (the Act "preserves the essentials of
   the agreement").

   As explained above, the compromise underlying the Act involves a basic
   quid pro quo. In exchange for accepting the marketing of digital audio
   recording technology and the use of such technology for noncommercial
   home taping, the music industry receives financial compensation
   (through the Act's royalty system) and protection against serial
   copying. This quid pro quo was central to the agreement and the
   legislation that embodies it. See, e.g., Senate Report at 30
   (summarizing the purpose and basic elements of the legislation).^ 3

   Construing Section 1008 to protect Napster would mean repudiating,
   rather than preserving, the quid pro quo underlying the Act. On the one
   hand, Napster would be permitted to facilitate the copying and
   distribution of copyrighted sound recordings on a scale far surpassing
   the "home taping" that Congress foresaw when it enacted the AHRA. On
   the other hand, the products employed by Napster and its users --
   computers and their hard drives -- are not subject to royalty payments
   (by Napster or anyone else) and are not required to be equipped with
   anti-serial copying circuitry, because the royalty and serial copying
   provisions of the Act apply only to "digital audio recording devices"
   and "digital audio recording media," and as shown above, those terms
   exclude computers and hard drives. 17 U.S.C. §§ 1002(a), 1003(a), 1004;
   see p. 15 supra. As a result, the music industry would bear the burdens
   of the statute without receiving the corresponding benefits.
     __________________________________________________________________

   ^3As noted above, unlike digital audio recording technology, analog
   recording technology has inherent limitations that make it
   substantially less useful for copying in general and serial copying in
   particular. For that reason, the Act does not require manufacturers of
   analog recording devices and media to make royalty payments or
   incorporate anti-serial copying circuitry. The exclusion of analog
   recording devices and media from the royalty and serial copying
   requirements of the Act does not mean that the statute is not
   predicated in a quid pro quo. Instead, it simply means that the
   rationale for the quid pro quo is not implicated by analog taping.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The legislative history makes clear that the Act's exclusion of
   computers and hard drives was the product of a deliberate choice by
   Congress. See, e.g., Senate Report at 48 ("a personal computer whose
   recording function is designed and marketed primarily for the recording
   of data and computer programs * * * would [not] qualify as a 'digital
   audio recording device'"). In invoking Section 1008, Napster is
   inviting this Court to countermand that legislative choice, and to do
   so in a way that undoes the reciprocal nature of the Act's digital
   recording provisions. That invitation should be declined.

2. Section 1008 Was Not Intended To Immunize All Consumer Copying of Musical
Recordings

   Section 1008 identifies with precision the consumer activity that
   Congress meant to shelter from copyright infringement suits: "the
   noncommercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for making
   digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings." 17 U.S.C. §
   1008. Despite the precision of this language, Napster asserts that
   Congress actually intended to immunize "all noncommercial consumer
   copying of music in digital or analog form" (Napster Brief at 20),
   whether or not the copying comes within the terms of Section 1008. But
   Napster has identified nothing in the limited legislative history of
   Section 1008 that supports this argument or overcomes the explicit
   language of the statute.

   The following passage from the House Report on the Act is
   representative of the legislative history regarding Section 1008:

   Section 1008 covers one of the critical components of the legislation:
   exemptions from liability for suit under title 17 for home taping of
   copyrighted musical works and sound recordings, and for contributory
   infringement actions under title 17 against manufacturers, importers,
   and distributors of digital and analog recording devices and recording
   media. In the case of home taping, the exemption protects all
   noncommercial copying by consumers of digital and analog musical
   recordings. Manufacturers, importers, and distributors of digital and
   analog recording devices and media have a complete exemption from
   copyright infringement claims based on the manufacture, importation, or
   distribution of such devices.

   House Report at 24, reprinted in 1992 USCCAN at 3594 (emphasis added).

   The highlighted references to "home taping" suggest, not surprisingly,
   that Congress meant to address the problem that gave rise to the AHRA
   -- the introduction and use of DAT tape decks and similar digital
   taping technology (see pp. 3-5 supra). There is no indication that
   Congress also meant to cover other kinds of devices and media that fall
   outside the terms of Section 1008. To the contrary, the legislative
   history reiterates the message conveyed by the language of the statute
   itself: Congress meant to "extend[] protection to users of such audio
   recording devices and media by prohibiting copyright infringement
   actions based on the use of such devices and media" to make musical
   recordings. Senate Report at 51 (emphasis added). In short, the
   legislative history confirms that Congress meant what it said in
   Section 1008 -- and what Congress said cannot be reconciled with what
   Napster is seeking.

3. The Legislative History of Statutes Other Than the AHRA is Irrelevant

   In construing the scope of Section 1008, Napster attempts to rely on
   the legislative history of two statutes other than the AHRA -- the
   Record Rental Amendment Act of 1984 and the Computer Software Rental
   Amendment Act of 1990. See Napster Brief at 23-24. Napster argues that
   Congress's treatment of "commercial" lending of phonorecords and
   computer software under those two statutes is consistent with Napster's
   reading of Section 1008. The short answer is that this case involves
   the meaning of the AHRA, not the meaning of other statutes. Napster's
   invocation of Section 1008 cannot be sustained on the basis of Section
   1008's own language and legislative history; a fortiori, it cannot be
   sustained by resort to the language and legislative history of
   unrelated statutes. The Record Rental Amendment Act and the Computer
   Software Rental Amendment Act were both enacted prior to the AHRA, and
   they address entirely different subjects. Neither their language nor
   their legislative history purports to address the meaning of Section
   1008 in any way.

C. Diamond Multimedia Does Not Resolve the AHRA Immunity Question At Issue in
This Case

   Napster suggests that this Court's decision in Diamond Multimedia
   confirms Napster's reading of Section 1008. It does not. The meaning
   and applicability of Section 1008 were not at issue in Diamond
   Multimedia, and nothing that the Court decided in Diamond Multimedia in
   any way requires the Court to accept Napster's Section 1008 defense in
   this case.

   Diamond Multimedia involved a suit under the AHRA by the recording
   industry against the manufacturer of the Rio portable music player, a
   "Walkman-like" device that plays MP3 music files. The recording
   industry claimed that the Rio player is a "digital audio recording
   device" and therefore is subject to the Act's royalty and serial
   copying provisions. Based on that claim, the recording industry sought
   to enjoin the manufacture and distribution of the Rio player and to
   compel Rio's manufacturer (Diamond) to make royalty payments under the
   Act. This Court rejected the industry claim, holding that the Rio
   player does not come within the Act's definition of a "digital audio
   recording device" and therefore is not subject to the Act's royalty and
   serial copying requirements. 180 F.3d at 1075-1081.

   Diamond Multimedia was not an action for copyright infringement.
   Because Section 1008 of the AHRA applies only to "action[s] * * * under
   this title alleging infringement of copyright," it was facially
   irrelevant to Diamond's liability, and Diamond never invoked Section
   1008 as a defense. Accordingly, the Court was not called on to decide
   whether Section 1008 protected Diamond itself, much less whether or how
   Section 1008 may protect defendants in other cases that (unlike Diamond
   Multimedia) involve claims of copyright infringement.

   Napster relies on a single passage from the Court's opinion in Diamond
   Multimedia:

   As the Senate Report explains, "[t] he purpose of [the Act] is to
   ensure the right of consumers to make analog or digital audio
   recordings of copyrighted music for their private, noncommercial use."
   S. Rep. 102-294, at *86 (emphasis added). The Act does so through its
   home taping exemption, see 17 U.S.C. § 1008, which "protects all
   noncommercial copying by consumers of digital and analog musical
   recordings," H.R. Rep. 102-873(I), at *59.

   180 F.3d at 1079 (emphasis in original).

   To the extent that this passage speaks to the meaning of Section 1008,
   it is no more than dictum, since Section 1008 was not at issue in the
   case. In any event, nothing in the passage is in any way inconsistent
   with the proposition that Section 1008 means what it says. The passage
   merely quotes excerpts from the House and Senate Reports regarding the
   purpose of the Act in general and Section 1008 in particular. As shown
   above, when the legislative history is considered in its entirety, it
   directly supports, rather than refutes, the conclusion that Section
   1008 does not protect Napster or its users. Accordingly, nothing in
   Diamond Multimedia provides refuge for Napster in this case.

CONCLUSION

   For the foregoing reasons, the district court's holding that Section
   1008 of the Audio Home Recording Act does not excuse Napster from
   liability is correct and should be affirmed.
