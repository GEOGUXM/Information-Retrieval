   FBI Top Ten

   The FBI web page is the latest venue for the display of the FBI's Top
   Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, which has historically graced the walls of
   post offices and other government buildings.

   The "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives" list began in 1950 as a permanent
   display of the country's most wanted fugitives after a reporter asked
   then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to name the toughest guys the FBI
   wanted to capture.

   Over the years, over 430 fugitives on the list have been captured or
   located.

   The decision to put a person on the list is based on the danger he or
   she poses to society and whether or not the FBI believes that publicity
   will aid in capture.

   The display of "Top Tenners" on the FBI web page at www.fbi.gov has
   already paid dividends: a fugitive was recently caught based on a tip
   from someone surfing the web.
