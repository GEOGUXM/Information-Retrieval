      WATER-QUALITY DATA FROM THE GROUND-WATER PROGRAM OF THE SOUTHERN
         FLORIDA STUDY UNIT OF THE U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY NATIONAL
                  WATER-QUALITY ASSESSMENT (NAWQA) PROGRAM

  Four surveys of shallow ground water were carried out in the Southern Florida
  NAWQA study area from October 1996 through January 1999: a citrus agriculture
  land-use survey of the surficial aquifer system in Collier and Hendry
  Counties; a Biscayne aquifer study-unit survey of public-supply wells; a
  recent residential and light commercial urban land-use survey in Broward
  County- and a ground-water and surface-water survey of a mixed-agriculture
  land-use area in southern Dade County.

   The files on this web site contain uniformly sampled data of 246
   physical and chemical properties of water collected from 109 wells and
   11 surface-water sites. The data include physical measurements, major
   ions, nutrients, organic carbon, radiochemicals, volatile organic
   compounds, pesticides, and inorganic trace elements. In order to
   capture the data presented here you will need to cut and paste from the

   Citrus Land-use Survey

  Thirty one wells were installed in citrus groves of varying ages, cultivation
  techniques, and citrus varieties. In addition, 5 wells were drilled in
  background areas in the same types of soils. Citrus groves in the Florida
  Flatwoods provinces are intensively drained to prevent inundation of tree
  roots in the fine silts and sands, however, the water table generally remains
  about 2-4 feet below land surface. Thus, almost all the wells were less than
  15 feet deep. All of the citrus wells were placed within the row in the tree
  drip line and were sampled once in early summer 1998. Ten wells were selected
  for a repeat sampling in October and November 1998. The background wells were
  sampled once.

   Study-unit Survey

  One well from each of 30 public-supply wellfields in Dade, Broward, and
  southern Palm Beach Counties was sampled once for all constituents in 1998.
  Untreated water was collected at the well pump from a faucet used by utilities
  personnel for sampling. Each well was being pumped at the time of sampling.
  Well depths ranged from 40 feet deep in the southern end of Dade County to 150
  feet deep in Palm Beach County.

   Urban Land-Use Survey

  The urban land-use survey was set in the central part of Broward County that
  has residential areas and light commercial parcels less than 25-30 years old
  in the same vicinity. Thirty-two urban wells and three wells in less-developed
  areas were sampled once for all constituents from November 1996 through April
  1997. Wells were installed in vacant residential properties, parks, golf
  courses, roadsides, and parking lots.Well depths ranged from 10 to 50 feet
  deep.

   Mixed-Agriculture Land-Use Survey

  The C-111 canal drains from north to south through an intensely-culfivated
  agricultural area between Homestead, Florida and Everglades National Park. In
  November 1997, the NAWQA team conducted an intensive water-quality study in
  the C-111 basin to better understand the connection between the shallow ground
  water and surface water. Surface-water flows were shut off above our study
  area so that ground water from farms would drain into a reach of the C-111 and
  C-113 canals and flow downstream through the S-177 structure. We collected
  water-quality samples for analyses of nutrients, anions, cations, trace
  elements, pesticides, and volatile organic compounds (VOCS) from seven wells
  and eleven surface-water sites. Two of the surface-water sites were sampled
  daily during the four-day drawdown. Average outflow from the basin during the
  drawdown was approximately 70 to 80 cubic feet per second, or 45-51 million
  gallons per day. As an additional data source, six public-supply wells in the
  Homestead area were sampled in January, 1998 for all constituents (see
  study-unit survey data).
