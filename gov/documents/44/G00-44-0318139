  Why?

     The Need for Water Vapor Measurements

     A thorough understanding of water vapor in the lower troposphere
     (first few kilometers above the earth's surface) is essential for
     forecasting weather, improving global climate models, and
     understanding the transmission of communication signals through the
     atmosphere. Currently, moisture profiles are obtained primarily from
     regular, twice-daily launchings of radiosondes (balloon-mounted
     instruments) or from satellite retrievals. The radiosondes launches
     from more than 100 sites across the nation requires considerable
     cost and manpower, and the resulting data profiles, taken once every
     12 hours, are inadequate to resolve the highly variable low level
     water vapor field. The satellite measurements have limited vertical
     resolution at low altitudes. Optical probing of the atmosphere using
     either differential absorption lidar (DIAL) or Raman lidar
     techniques has also been employed to measure water vapor profiles
     with good vertical resolution (better than 500 m) from both
     ground-based and air-based platforms. However, the instruments used
     to obtain these observations are typically highly complex, expensive
     research instruments. A combined-instrument retrieval technique is
     also under development at ETL.

     The goal of this project is to develop a compact, low-cost,
     eye-safe, automated remote-sensing instrument called a lidar which
     can continuously profile water vapor. Such a lidar could be widely
     deployed resulting in considerably more data for improved
     forecasting and modeling. For this project, water vapor
     concentrations will be measured using the Differential Absorption
     Lidar (DIAL) technique.

  Instrument Design


   [Dial_1.jpg]

   CAPTION: Simulation results for a low power, high repetition-rate,
   direct-detection lidar at 830 nm. The lidar has a 15-minute averaging
   time, 100-m vertical resolution, a 120-mRad field of view, and 20 mW of
   average power. The laser pulse rate is 10 kHz.

   Computer simulations of a DIAL system were used to compare
   theoretically the performance of the water vapor DIAL as a function of
   system parameters including wavelength, acceptance angle, and laser
   power. Direct detection with both pulses and pseudo-random code
   modulation and heterodyning detection were also compared. The
   simulations demonstrated that a high repetition rate, low power (<100
   mW average) direct-detection system could provide adequate returns
   (error of <1g/kg) to beyond the boundary layer (3 km) both day and
   night.

   The application of emerging diode laser technology in DIAL systems
   offers the promise of deployable, unattended instruments for continuous
   water vapor profiling in the lower troposphere. Such small systems
   could be constructed and deployed at costs roughly equivalent to radar
   wind profilers. The lidar water vapor measurements at low altitudes can
   be combined with observations of column-integrated water vapor obtained
   from ground-based radiometer or Global Positioning System methods to
   improve the vertical resolution and accuracy of water profiling
   estimates.

   CAPTION: Schematic of DIAL system. Transmitter components include an
   external cavity diode laser (ECDL), optical isolators (ISO), the flared
   diode amplifier (AMP), and detectors (DET). The receiver system
   includes a narrowband (NB) filter, a polarizing beamsplitter (pol. BS),
   and an avalanche photodiode (APD).

   The laser characteristics required for acceptable DIAL performance from
   a low-power system include stable single frequency light with a TEM[00]
   mode, pulse durations of less than 1 Âµs, no pre-pulse light and a pulse
   repetition frequency near 10 kHz. An all solid-state laser system can
   have the advantages of simplicity, compactness, stability and
   energy-efficiency. A broadly tunable laser permits access to the
   optimum water vapor lines in a wavelength region and also can be
   switched to different lines as the water vapor makes large changes. A
   diode-based laser system is preferred because diode lasers are quite
   small, simple, rugged, very energy-efficient (~40% QE), and inexpensive
   to produce in large quantities. Advanced fabrication techniques have
   resulted in tunable, single frequency diodes for applications requiring
   high spectral quality. Eye safety can be achieved by working in the
   infrared and by expanding the transmitted laser beam.

   In collaboration with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and NCAR we are
   building a compact, eye-safe water vapor DIAL system with good
   measurement capabilities in the lower troposphere. The lidar is
   comprised of a laser transmitter, a receiver, and some computerized
   electronics for data-taking, monitoring, and synchronization. The laser
   transmitter consists of a pulsed diode (flared) amplifier seeded by a
   cw tunable single-frequency diode laser. Key elements of the receiver
   include a narrow-band filter to block sky background light and a highly
   sensitive photon-counting detector.

  Status

     We are currently running our first tests of the breadboard version
     of the water vapor DIAL. Following successful laboratory tests, we
     will rebuild this system for the field applications. The fieldable
     system will be in a waterproof, temperature-controlled housing.
     Initially we will validate the instrument via intercomparisons using
     in situ water vapor sensors or other lidars.

     Funding for this project has been provided by NOAA OGP, NOAA ETL,
     NSF/NCAR USWRP and NASA GSFC.
