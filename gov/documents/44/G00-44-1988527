   Market Conduct Division (MCD)

                                [Cdismal.gif]


     The Market Conduct Division consists of the Field Claims Bureau and
     the Field Rating and Underwriting Bureau.

     These two bureaus conduct examinations of companies to be sure the
     companies are in compliance with the California Insurance Code and
     the California Code of Regulations with respect to rating,
     underwriting and claim handling practices. Exams can be scheduled
     based on complaint activity, special requests, or the regular
     schedule. Exam results are documented in market conduct examination
     reports.
