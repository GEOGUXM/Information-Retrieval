                                VOTER REGISTRATION

      Who May Register to Vote?
      Any citizen of the United States who is or will be eighteen (18) years
      of age or older before the date of the next election and who has been a
      resident of the State of Tennessee and of Hamilton County for at least
      twenty (20) days unless disqualified under law.

      How and Where May Qualified Voters Register?
      Qualified voters register to vote by obtaining and completing a voter
      registration form and filing the form with the Hamilton County Election
      Commission office. Qualified voters can register either in person or by
      mail.
        * In Person: Registration forms may be completed at the Hamilton
          County Election Commission office, the Department of Safety (motor
          vehicles division), Department of Health (WIC program), Department
          of Human Services, Department of Mental Health and Mental
          Retardation, Department of Veteran's Affairs, all branches of the
          public library, the County Clerk's office and the Register of
          Deed's office.

        * By Mail: Voter registration forms may be obtained from the Hamilton
          County Election Commission office, any Post Office and a variety of
          other public offices.

      When May A Qualified Voter Register?
      In order to participate in an election, a qualified voter must be
      properly registered no later than thirty (30) days before the election.
      The Hamilton County Election Commission office will process any by-mail
      voter registration form that has been postmarked at least thirty (30)
      days before the election.
      __________________________________________________________________

                       VOTER REGISTRATION CHANGE OF ADDRESS

      To avoid complications on election day, registered voters should keep
      the Hamilton County Election Commission office informed of any change
      in address. To process a change of address, the Election Commission
      office must receive written notice over the voter's signature of the
      change no later than thirty (30) days before any given election. A
      voter may appear in person at the Election Commission office to submit
      the change or it may be submitted by mail or by fax.

      If on the day of the election the address on the voter's permanent
      registration record differs from the voter's current address, then the
      voter must complete an affidavit before being allowed to vote. The
      voter will then be instructed to take the completed affidavit to their
      new precinct in order to cast their election day ballot.

   To facilitate the process of keeping voter registration records
   accurate, the Election Commission office conducts an ongoing address
   verification program to identify voters who have changed their address
   but have not yet notified the Election Commission.  If the Hamilton
   County Election Commission determines or suspects that a voter has
   changed their address, the Administrator will mail a forwardable
   confirmation notice on which the voter may verify or correct the new
   address.  If the voter fails to respond to the confirmation notice, and
   if the voter fails to otherwise update their voter registration over a
   period of two (2) consecutive regular November elections following the
   date the notice was first sent, the voters registration will be purged
   from the registration files.


   Have you moved and need to change your address
           on your voters registration?
