   Workshop participants will learn how to identify caution zone jobs and
   how to analyze these jobs using the criteria in the ergonomics rule.
   Topics include:
     * The physical risk factors that identify caution zone jobs.
     *  How to identify and analyze hazards for work-related
       musculoskeletal disorders.
     * The requirements for ergonomics awareness education.
     * The principles of ergonomics and how to use them to reduce hazards.

   There is no cost to attend a workshop. To register by phone: call
   1-800-574-2829 and listen to the recorded message. Provide the
   requested information, including course number, when prompted.

   To register online: Visit the ergonomics workshops page and follow the
   online instructions.

   Labor and Industries adopted the ergonomics rule in May 2000. Each
   year, more than 50,000 Washington workers suffer work-related
   musculoskeletal injuries. These injuries cost more than $411 million a
   year in medical treatment and lost wages, L&I's workers' compensation
   data show.

   Approximately 600 employers in Washington — the largest companies in
   the highest-risk industries — will be the first covered by the
   ergonomics rule, starting July 1 of this year. For other employers, the
   requirements take effect between July 1, 2003 and July 1, 2006,
   depending on company size.

                                     ###
