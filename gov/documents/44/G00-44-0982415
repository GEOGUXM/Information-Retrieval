                        Half Pint Library Book Drive

   On January 9, 2002 at city's newest health facility, the Ricardo
   Salinas Metro Health Clinic,  Half Price Books kicked off this year's
   Half Pint Library Book Drive.  The drive, scheduled for January through
   March, will benefit the children who attend Metro Health community
   clinics and WIC centers throughout the city of San Antonio.

   This year's goal is 20,000 books.  All City of San Antonio employees
   are encouraged to donate books at either Half Price Book stores or at
   donation boxes that will be located in select city offices.

   What is a Half Pint Library?

   Half Pint Libraries were created to give children and their families
   the chance to read and share books while staying in hospitals,
   pediatric clinics, special needs schools and community centers.
   Children are encouraged to read to take their minds off of treatment or
   being otherwise confined to unpleasant settings, and to promote
   childhood literacy skills. The groundwork began in 1998, and by 1999,
   the program had gathered over 80,000 books.  Now in its fourth year,
   the program has provided nearly 700,000 books for children to share and
   enjoy.

   How are Libraries Built?

   Half Pint Libraries are "built", or stocked, with books donated during
   the annual Half Pint Library book drive that runs each January through
   March.  Donations from patrons and community members are crucial to the
   success of the program.  Last year, over 286,000 books were donated and
   distributed to Half Pint Libraries across the nation.  Once a site is
   chosen for a library, Half Price Books provides colorful carts and
   shelves and the first round of books so children can immediately begin
   reading.

   How does the annual Half Pint Library Book Drive Work?

   Each January through March, all Half Price books locations place
   donation boxes to collect used children's books ranging from "tot to
   teen" age groups. Half Price employees sort and grade each book to make
   sure that children will receive only new and gently-used books.
   Facilities usually receive their books in the spring, once all of the
   donations have been sorted.
