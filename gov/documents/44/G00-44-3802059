                  Solid State Theory of Photovoltaic Materials

   Semiconductor materials such as CuInSe[2], CdS, CdTe, and ZnO have been
   used widely in photovoltaic device applications. For example, CuInSe[2]
   with a direct band gap of 1.04 eV is a prototype member of the family
   of I-III-VI2 chalcopyrite semiconductors. It has shown great potential
   as a low cost thin-film photovoltaic material, achieving 17% efficiency
   in polycrystalline form by alloying it with CuGaSe[2]. Unlike
   convensional binary semiconductors (e.g., GaAs or ZnSe), CuInSe[2]
   appear to tolerate a large range of anion-to-cation off-stoichiometry
   (i.e., samples with a few percentage Cu-poor and/or In-poor
   stoichiometries are stable and useful). CuInSe[2] can be doped p and n
   type to a low-resistivity level merely via introduction of native
   defects, without extrinsic impurities. However, the doping mechanism
   and other properties of CuInSe[2] are not well understood at a
   fundamental level. It is crucial to understand these properties to
   further improve the cell efficiency and reduce the cost of solar
   energy.

   The Solid State Theory Group at NREL has been a significant component
   of the fundamental research of NREL's PV program. It is the only
   systematic effort in applying modern condensed matter theory to
   photovoltaics. Researchers in this Group have pioneered theoretical
   research into the material properties and electronic structures of
   chalcopyrite semiconductors, providing early predictions for the
   beneficial effects of Ga-additions into CuInSe[2], and guidelines for
   analysis of spectroscopic, transport and X-ray measurements on
   CuInSe[2]including band offsets and alloying effects. These theoretical
   predictions and understanding have helped significantly experiments
   aimed at clarifying and assessing crucial PV functions.

   Recently, using first-principles self-consistent electronic structure
   theory, the researchers at the Theory Group have calculated defect
   formation energies and defect transition energy levels in CuInSe[2].
   Contrary to previously accepted assumptions in the analysis of defects
   in CuInSe[2], they find that (i) it is much easier to form Cu vacancy
   in CuInSe[2] than to form cation vacancies in II-VIs. (ii) Defect
   formation energies vary considerably both with the Fermi energy and the
   chemical potential of the atomic species, and (iii) Defect pairs such
   as (2V[Cu]+In[Cu]) have a remarkably low formation enthalpy. This
   explains the massive non-stoichiometry of CuInSe[2] and the appearance
   of ordered defect compounds (ODCs) (e.g., CuIn[3]Se[5] as ordered array
   of 2V[Cu]+In[Cu] defect pairs inside CuInSe[2]. The fact that CuInSe[2]
   has good electrical properties despite this off-stoichiometry is
   explained in terms of the mutual passivation of donor In[Cu] by
   acceptor V[Cu].

   Other research includes studying defects in CdTe/CdS alloys and
   interfaces, and studying band offsets between photovoltaic
   semiconductors.
