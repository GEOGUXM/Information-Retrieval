    Letter 12-83

   Date of Issue:   July 19, 1983                      Effective Date:
   July 19,1983

   In Reply Refer To:     W/OTS                    File With: H- 1 1

   Subject:     Review and Approval of Facilities Projects

   Reference(s):   WSOM Chapter H-11, issuance 72-13, dated May 26, 1972

   WSOM, Chapter H-11, establishes specific guidelines for planning NWS
   facilities and assigns responsibilities for accomplishing the planning
   and programming. The plan for development, submittal, review and
   approval process is explicit for projects using Research, Development,
   and Facilities (RD&F) funds (now titled Operations, Research, and
   Facilities (OR&F) funds).

   Normally, OR&F funds are provided by WSH. In recent years, some regions
   have funded sizeable projects and have not complied with the contents
   of Chapter H-11. Since all funds evolve from the OR&F source, I
   consider compliance with Chapter H-11, WSOM, to be a requirement
   regardless of whether funding is furnished by WSH or the region.

   In order to clarify the responsibility outlined in Chapter H-11, a
   compliance threshold of $50,000 is established. Any projects costing
   less than this amount may be reviewed and approved by the Regional
   Director. Projects with an estimated, or possible total cost of more
   than $50,000 shall be prepared and submitted for approval as specified
   in Chapter H-11.

   The requirements of this OML will be included in a pending revision of
   Chapter H-11, WSOM. This OML will be cancelled upon issuance of the
   revised Chapter H-11.
