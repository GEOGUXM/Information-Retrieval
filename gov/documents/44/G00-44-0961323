  Overview

   Research Goals
     * Instrumentation for Nuclear Medical Imaging
     * Improved Detectors for Positron Emission Tomography
     * Development of Dense, Ultra-Fast Scintillators

   The objective of this group is to improve instrumentation for nuclear
   medical imaging. Most of our efforts concentrate on advanced detector
   concepts for imaging positron-labeled tracers, but we are also seeking
   to image single-photon emitting tracers and x-rays.
   The most commonly utilized techniques for detecting ionizing radiation
   (which includes positrons, gamma rays, and x-rays) involve
   scintillators, which are materials that convert ionizing radiation into
   a brief flash of light. Therefore, we are involved in developing new
   scintillators and performing fundamental studies of scintillation
   mechanisms. We also are developing new methods that use the light from
   the scintillators to accurately measure the position and energy of the
   ionizing radiation. This includes development of new silicon photodiode
   arrays (devices that convert the scintillation light into minute
   electrical signals) and custom integrated circuits (to amplify these
   minute signals). Finally, we are designing and constructing several
   complete imaging systems based on these core technologies. These
   systems have geometries optimized for imaging either brain disease or
   breast cancer. Technology transfer of these techniques and devices to
   other research institutions and industry will permit the production of
   improved nuclear medical imaging instrumentation for the benefit of
   medical research throughout the world.
