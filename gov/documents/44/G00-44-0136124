   Washington State Department of Health

   Date: January 29, 2002
   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
   Contact: Jill Hanks, public information officer, DOH, 360-236-4079

   Department of Health continues to work on emergency preparedness

   OLYMPIA - How long would it take to get the medication you need in a
   major public health emergency? On Jan. 24, the Department of Health,
   along with a number of partners, conducted a demonstration of the
   National Pharmaceutical Stockpile (NPS) to find out.

   The NPS is a large stockpile of antibiotics, vaccines and medical
   supplies for use in a large unusual disease outbreak or other public
   health emergency, including a bioterrorism attack. The stockpile is
   maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It
   has two components. The first consists of eight "push packages"
   positioned at strategic, undisclosed locations around the country. Push
   packages would be delivered within 12 hours of a federal decision to
   approve a request for the NPS from the governor of any state. The
   second component is called Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI), drugs
   shipped directly from manufacturers (vendors) at federal request. If
   the incident requires a larger or multi-phased response, tailored VMI
   packages will be shipped after the push packages, arriving within 24 to
   36 hours.

   The NPS was deployed for the first time when it was sent to New York
   City after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. The
   stockpile supplies arrived within eight hours.

   "The demonstration was intended to test the agency's draft plan for
   mass distribution of medication in a public health emergency," said
   Manager Dennis Anderson. The plan is designed to help local health
   jurisdictions in Washington set up a dispensing clinic and dispense the
   medications needed by people who may have been exposed to disease.

   "There is a lot of work being done to make sure we are prepared for
   public health emergencies in this state," said State Health Secretary
   Mary Selecky. "We've been working closely with local health
   departments, the Governor, the state patrol, emergency management and
   many others." Selecky explained that this demonstration focused on one
   piece of the state's overall plan.

   Nearly 70 people staffed the event, held at the University of
   Washington - from health educators and pharmacists to evaluators and
   security personnel. More than 250 volunteer participants were given
   character scenarios to act out, with various health issues or concerns.

   It will take a few weeks to evaluate the results - including exactly
   how long it will take to get medication; however, first impressions
   were that the event went smoothly, and a number of ways to improve the
   plan were identified.

   "We didn't expect the plan to go perfectly," Anderson said. "The reason
   for this exercise was to find the gaps, then work on filling them. We
   did that, and I believe the exercise was successful."

   Several organizations joined the Department of Health in planning and
   carrying out the demonstrations. Employees of local health
   jurisdictions from around the state, Seattle Fire Department,
   University of Washington staff and other community partners, were
   involved.
