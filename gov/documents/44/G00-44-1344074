   Annotated Bibliography of Statistical Papers Current Population Survey
   Redesign Bibliography Economic Working Paper Collection National
   Longitudinal Surveys Discussion Papers
   The Annotated Bibliography of Statistical Papers (PDF 266K), maintained
   by the Office of Survey Methods Research, contains papers written by
   BLS statisticians and behavioral scientists. Included in the
   bibliography are papers presented at the annual Joint Statistical
   Meetings and other conferences, as well as papers appearing in journals
   and the BLS Statistical Notes series. In January of 1994, a completely
   redesigned Current Population Survey (CPS) was put into full scale
   production use. Eight years of planning and extensive research led up
   to this transition from the old survey to the new survey, which also
   utilizes computer assisted data collection methods. This bibliography,
   maintained by the Office of Survey Methods Research, is a collection of
   research papers written by BLS and Census Bureau statisticians and
   behavioral scientists on all phases of the redesign of the CPS. The BLS
   Economic Working Paper Series is a collection of research papers
   authored by senior economists within various offices of the Bureau of
   Labor Statistics. This series is maintained by the Office of Employment
   Research and Program Development, the Compensation Research and Program
   Development Group, and the Division of Price and Index Number Research.
   The purpose of the BLS Working Paper Series is to circulate research
   findings to interested readers within and outside the BLS as a means of
   encouraging discussion prior to publication in academic journals. Since
   the late 1960s, the National Longitudinal Surveys have served as a rich
   source of data for researchers in a broad range of disciplines.
   Periodically, NLS staff locates aspects of NLS data that has not yet
   been fully explored. External researchers and organizations whose
   projects further the mission of the NLS program to conduct sound,
   legitimate research in the social sciences are then funded through the
   BLS Grants Program to perform ongoing analyses of data from the NLS.
   Their results are published in the NLS Discussion Paper series. This
   series is maintained by the National Longitudinal Surveys Program
   within the Office of Employment Research and Program Development.
