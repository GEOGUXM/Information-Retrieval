   Project description

   Rapid population growth in coastal Georgia, increased tourism, and
   sustained industrial activity have adversely affected coastal Georgia's
   water resources and limited the available water supply. The main source
   of water supply in the coastal area is the Upper Floridan aquifer, an
   extremely productive water source, which was first developed in the
   late 1800's, and has been used extensively in the area ever since.
   Pumpage from the aquifer has resulted in several problems including:
     * substantial water-level declines
     * migration of seawater into the aquifer at the northern end of
       Hilton Head Island, South Carolina;
     * contamination of the aquifer from underlying brine-filled strata at
       Brunswick, Georgia;
     * decreased ground-water inflow to springs, freshwater ponds,
       marshes, and wetlands, which could impact the balance of freshwater
       and saltwater in tidal rivers and estuaries;

   Saltwater contamination has constrained further development of the
   Upper Floridan aquifer in coastal Georgia and created fierce competing
   demands for the limited fresh water supply. The Georgia Environmental
   Protection Division (GaEPD) released an interim strategy in April 1997
   to manage saltwater intrusion in the Upper Floridan aquifer. As part of
   this interim plan, GaEPD has capped permitted withdrawal from the Upper
   Floridan aquifer at 1997 rates in the Savannah and Brunswick areas, and
   has funded a program of scientific and feasibility studies (Coastal
   Sound Science Initiative) to support development a final
   water-management strategy. Implementation of the final water-management
   strategy is scheduled for January 2006.

   USGS has studied saltwater contamination of the Upper Floridan aquifer
   in coastal Georgia for over 50 years through the cooperative water
   resources program. In support of the Sound Science Initiative, the USGS
   is working on a comprehensive program to evaluate ground-water flow,
   saltwater contamination, and alternative water sources of ground water
   in the coastal area of Georgia and adjacent parts of South Carolina and
   Florida. The study is being conducted in cooperation with GaEPD and the
   Georgia Water Resources Research Institute. Project activities include:
     * offshore drilling near Savannah and Hilton Head Island;
     * drilling of deep test wells onshore;
     * evaluation of alternative water supplies in man-made seepage ponds;
     * ground-water monitoring; and
     * simulation of saltwater intrusion using digital ground-water models
