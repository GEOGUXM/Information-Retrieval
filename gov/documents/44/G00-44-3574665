                       NARA's Web Site Privacy Statement

     Our web site privacy policy is:
     * We consider "personally identifying information" to be: your name
       or a unique identifier (such as an IP address), your e-mail
       address, your mailing address, your telephone number, and any
       financial information relating to your or your accounts that you
       may provide us.
     * Our public web site does not use "cookies." We consider "cookies"
       to be computer files that a web site places on your computer system
       without your knowledge or permission. Our Centers Information
       Processing System (CIPS), intended only for Government use and not
       for the public, uses temporary cookies to support business
       transactions only.
     * Our system collects server log data which will include your IP
       address, your domain name, the type of browser and operating system
       you used, the pages you viewed, search requests, in some cases data
       you submitted via web forms, and, if you linked to our site from
       another web site, that web site's address. After three months from
       the time of collection, we aggregate this data and use it for
       statistical purposes. This is how we discover how many "hits" our
       site received. The aggregated data helps us to ascertain, for
       example, the volume of our web site users' interest in portions of
       our web site, and to help us understand how to improve the
       navigation and content of our web site.
     * Personally identifying information that you provide by email or web
       forms will be used only for such purposes as are described at the
       point of collection (for example on a web form), such as to send
       information or products to you, or to respond to your questions or
       comments. If you provide contact information, NARA staff or its
       contractors may contact you to clarify your comment or question, or
       to learn about your level of customer satisfaction with our
       services.
     * We do not sell any personal information to third parties.
     * We may transfer personal information to a third party only in the
       following cases:

     * To a bank or United States Department of the Treasury account,
       which must receive payment for a transaction that you initiated;
     * To a company that is contracted to assist us with specific
       services, including electronic commerce or donations, and which
       agrees not to sell or use personal information for other purposes;
     * To legal authorities if we suspect that you are attempting to
       change or otherwise damage this web site, or you are using it in
       violation of Federal or local laws;
     * To the Foundation for the National Archives, a non-governmental
       501(c)(3) organization that supports the programs and activities of
       NARA, when you use our online services to make a donation; or
     * To Congress or a court in response to a subpoena.

     The first time that you use an area of our site that utilizes
   animation software, such as "Flash" or "Shockwave," it is possible that
   our site will provide you an opportunity to go to the software
   manufacturer's web site so you may download a related plug-in that will
   enable your browser to show you that part of our web site. This prompt
   occurs because our system can tell whether your browser has the needed
   capabilities provided by these plug-ins. Our system does not read or
   place anything on your hard drive when recognizing your browser's
   capabilities. While the plug-in(s) are needed to view some content, you
   retain control and choice about conducting the download. At the time
   that we create and post the web pages that require these software
   plug-ins for viewing, they are provided by their manufacturer for
   download and use free of charge. We can not guaranty, however, that the
   plug-in will remain free, or that the manufacturer will not collect
   personally identifying information about you when you elect to download
   the software from their site. If you choose to visit the manufacturer's
   web site to obtain the plug-in, please carefully review their posted
   policies for details about personal privacy and use of downloaded
   plug-ins.

     Although questions, comments, and other communications that we
   receive generally are not retained as permanent records, please note
   that it is possible that any mail--electronic or paper--that we (or any
   Federal agency, for that matter) receive could become part of the
   permanent record of the agency, if the mail is part of materials that
   are scheduled for permanent retention.
