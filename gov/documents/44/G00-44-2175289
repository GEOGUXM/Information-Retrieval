    The Kelso City Council has the authority to set the city's policies.
    The mayor, elected from among the council members, serves a two-year
    term and is recognized as head of the city, although he does not have
    any regular administrative duties. Council members are elected by the
   citizens of Kelso. Council members serve for four years, and the terms
                               are staggered.

    The first Kelso City Council met in June of 1890. See our web site of
                            past Mayors of Kelso.

     month at 7 p.m. at the Kelso City Council Chambers, 501 1st Street,
      Kelso Train Depot. You may obtain a copy of the current agenda by
