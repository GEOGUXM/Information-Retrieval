   Fungal Species as Biocontrols

 Agricultural Research Service fungi experts have identified new fungal
 species that scientists at several U.S. laboratories are testing as
 biocontrols for some of the United States' major invasive weeds.

 American farmers and homeowners spend millions to control weeds and other
 organisms introduced from foreign countries. With the increase in
 international trade and travel, the number of outside species becoming
 established in this country is growing every year. Fungi provide a vast
 arsenal of ammunition to control noxious weeds--both established and newly
 arrived--that invade roadsides, rangelands and waterways, crowding out
 useful and native plants.

 ARS mycologist Amy Y. Rossman, who heads the Systematic Botany and Mycology
 Laboratory in Beltsville, Md., says that fungi are among the most
 biologically diverse organisms on Earth. Once discovered and characterized,
 many previously unknown species can be put to work.

 ARS mycologist David F. Farr at Rossman's lab is curator of the
 ARS-Smithsonian U.S. National Fungus Collections maintained at Beltsville.
 Farr uses the 1 million fungal specimens in the collection to discover,
 name, scientifically describe and classify agriculturally important fungi.

 Once characterized, the weed-control potential of these organisms can be
 tested in field and lab experiments. Farr recently discovered several
 fungi--two new to science--that may offer nonchemical control of ragweed,
 purple loosestrife, kudzu and morning glory. They are being tested at
 several ARS research laboratories in the United States.

 Agricultural Research magazine on the web at:
