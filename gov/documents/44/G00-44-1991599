   Below are links to various meteorological models that are used in
   forecasting the weather. These are rather technical and will be hard to
   understand if you are not familiar with them. But for those weather
   enthusiasts, or others who have a keen interest in the weather, it is
   hoped you might find them useful. Also, these are only a few sites
   where you can find this information. It is not intended to favor one or
   the other. Choose one you like, or go to the commercial sites link for
   more weather information on the world wide web.
