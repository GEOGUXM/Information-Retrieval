   The "Real-time streamflow" map tracks short-term changes (over several
   hours) in rivers and streams. Although the general appearance of the
   map changes very little from one hour to the next, individual sites may
   change rapidly in response to major rain events or to reservoir
   releases.

   color code for 25th - 74th percentile       25th - 74th percentile
   color code for 10th - 24th percentile       10th - 24th percentile

   color code for not ranked                   Not ranked
   The map depicts streamflow conditions as measured at USGS gaging
   stations. The colors represent real-time streamflow compared to
   percentiles of historical daily streamflow for the day of the year.
   This map represents conditions adjusted for this time of the year. Only
   stations having at least 30 years of record are used.
   States containing no dots indicate locations where flow data for the
   current day are temporarily unavailable. During winter months, some
   states(or parts of states) may have fewer dots than at other times of
   the year due to ice effects.
   The data used to produce this map are provisional and have not been
   reviewed or edited. They may be subject to significant change.
