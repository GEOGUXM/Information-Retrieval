                             Tropospheric Aerosols
     __________________________________________________________________

   Atmospheric aerosols (sub-micron and micron-sized particles suspended
   in air) originate both from natural and man-made sources. Due to their
   short lifetime and strong tropospheric interactions, their global
   concentrations and properties are poorly known. Aerosol particles
   affect atmospheric radiation and cloud microphysics, and are considered
   a major uncertainty in climate forcing. Saharan dust generated over
   Africa and transported over the Atlantic Ocean to America is an example
   of a natural source. It is hypothesized that the dust has a major role
   in fertilization of the Amazon forest. Also, oceanic phytoplankton
   generates dimethyl-sulfide gas that is a precursor of the oceanic
   sulfate aerosol, which is also a natural gas.

   Man-made aerosol particles are produced in industrial and urban areas
   of the Northern Hemisphere by conversion of gases (e.g., SO2 and NOX)
   into liquids in chemical reactions, and through emission of graphitic
   carbon. This pollution spreads over the Norther Hemisphere and takes
   part in acidification of rain and reduction of visibility. Reflection
   of sunlight by the particles and their effect on cloud microphysics is
   purported to counteract a significant part of the expected greenhouse
   warming.

   Biomass burning in tropical regions, especially the Amazon rain forest,
   is used to clear land for agriculture. This generates a large fraction
   of the global flux of aerosol particles as well as trace gases such as
   CO2, CO, and CH4. Smoke particles have similar effects on visibility,
   clouds, precipitation, and radiation as industrial and urban aerosol.

   Branch research includes studies of the physical and optical properties
   of atmospheric aerosol particles using ground-based, airborne, and
   spaceborne instrumentation. An airborne experiment was conducted to
   measure the atmospheric impact of smoke generated from the oil fires in
   Kuwait. Field experiments have also been conducted in the Amazon Basin
   of Brazil and in a desert transition area in Israel. Development of
   radiative transfer models to treat the aerosol radiative effects and
   the inclusion of these effects in climate models are also an integral
   part of branch research activities. Tropospheric aerosols also obscure
   surface features that are observed by satellites. Methods are developed
   to correct satellite digital images in order to obtain clearer pictures
   of the surface, and estimates of aerosol properties are obtained from
   digital satellite data.
