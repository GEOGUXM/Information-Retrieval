   What's New at the Home Energy Saver

      See our new pages on "Energy Myths," for common myths and
      misperceptions about saving energy and on the Non-Energy Benefits of
      energy-efficiency measures.

      Check out our new Start Saving Energy Today module. It's full of
      information and tips on how to get started saving energy immediately.

      We have upgraded our back-end database to an ORACLE system. Users will
      notice considerable improvements in run time.

      The Energy Advisor has been redesigned to make it easier to tailor the
      energy estimates to your house. There are now three levels of detail
      available for describing the house. The first estimates your energy use
      based solely on your ZIP code, the second asks approximately 20
      questions about the house, and the third provides all the detailed
      questions that have been in HES all along. We also made it easier to
      navigate among these detailed input pages. For instance, in the heating
      and cooling module, you no longer have to go through all the pages in
      order to estimate energy consumption. You can enter information about
      one or many parts of your house before returning to the whole-house
      summary page.

      We have completed a major update to the HES Librarian with links to
      state-level residential utility programs and other useful information.

      We recently added the 1998 Listing of Most Efficient Appliances,
      compiled by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy
      (ACEEE). These lists identify specific energy-efficient products, by
      model number, which is useful when you are purchasing a new appliance
      or other equipment for your home.

      We recently debuted an entirely new module for the Home Energy Saver --
      the Making it Happen module.

        WeÂ’ve developed this module to help you successfully capitalize on
        the energy savings opportunities identified by the Energy Advisor
        module. Here you'll find a host of links to practical information,
        ranging from:
        * lists of specific efficient products ...
        * to tips about selecting a good contractor ...
        * to information on what assistance your utility might have to offer.

      Through special arrangement with Home Energy Magazine, the Home Energy
      Saver features extensive passages from the book No-Regrets Remodeling
      as part of the Making It Happen module.

      The Home Energy Saver Librarian is still available as part of the
      Making it Happen module.

      The Home Energy Saver has been getting more media attention lately, and
      more web sites have been linking to us. See our complete list of all
      the press and web references of which we are aware. If you see the Home
      Energy Saver mentioned in the press or on a web site, please let us
      know using the e-mail button in the navigation bar.

      Several more features are currently under development:
        * Retrofit module (to help you easily estimate the savings from
          ENERGY STAR products)
        * Economic evaluation module
        * Searchable Librarian

      Check out the new Automobile Energy Efficiency Information page.
