                        Instrument / Project Overview
     __________________________________________________________________

      The Wide Field Camera 3 project was originally conceived as a way to
      provide a backup imaging capability for HST during the second decade of
      the HST mission. During the later phases of study for the instrument,
      it became very clear that there are some key scientific questions that
      we can easily tailor the instrument to address.

      A main theme for WFC3 science is the ability to do large-field,
      panchromatic imaging. As revealed by recent HST and other studies, the
      spectral characteristics of galactic populations pushes the discovery
      space into the red and blue extremes of HST capability. These are the
      regions that WFC3 is designed to explore.

      Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) is a radial instrument. It is designed to
      replace the Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) which was installed
      in the HST during the First Servicing Mission (FSM) in December 1993.
      WFC3 is designed to use as much of the HST field-of-view as possible
      for such an instrument. WFC3 is designed to operate over the wavelength
      range of 200 nm to 1800 nm, from Near Ultraviolet to Near Infrared.
      WFC3 will have greater throughput and sensitivity than WFPC2, and will
      be nearly as good as ACS in the areas where ACS excels.

      Wide Field Camera 3 represents more than an instrument. It also
      represents an optimized approach to the development of orbital science
      instruments. In an age of declining budgets, the WFC3 project is
      designed to take advantage of much of the hardware, software, and
      experience of the previous instruments. WF/PC (1) was returned
      following the FSM and many of its assemblies are available for re-use.
      Flight spares of optical components are also available and can be used
      in WFC3 at minimal cost. The teams of Government, Academia, and
      Industry who worked to successfully build WF/PC (1) and WFPC2 are
      working together again to bring us WFC3, leveraging their expertise and
      experience to provide a superior instrument at modest cost.
