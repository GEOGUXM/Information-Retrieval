   Have You Moved Recently?

   The California Code of Regulations requires that address changes be
   reported to the Landscape Architects Technical Committee within 30 days
   of moving. Reporting these changes will ensure that you receive
   necessary information on renewals and other matters important to your
   licensure. Failure to notify the Program is a violation of the
   California Code of Regulations, Title 16, Section 5657.

   If you are a candidate for examination or a licensee and you moved
   recently, please complete and submit the following form so that your
   record may be updated.
