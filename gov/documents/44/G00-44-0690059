                                Introduction

   The Black Hills area is a unique and valuable asset to the State of
   South Dakota. In addition to its historic landmarks, scenic beauty,
   timber, and mineral resources, the Black Hills area is a major source
   of water. Streams flowing from the Black Hills provide water for a
   multitude of uses in the Cheyenne and Belle Fourche River Basins. In
   addition, much of western South Dakota and parts of eastern Wyoming are
   underlain by bedrock aquifers that are recharged in the Black Hills
   area.

   Water resources of the Black Hills area have been stressed by
   increasing population, resource development, and periodic droughts.
   Additional water supplies are being developed for rapidly expanding
   communities. The potential exists for water-quality degradation from
   mining activity, urbanization, irrigation, forest management
   activities, and recreational development. Drought conditions in the
   late 1980's caused reduced streamflow, declining reservoir and
   ground-water levels, and shortages of water supplies for domestic,
   municipal, industrial, agricultural, and recreational purposes.

   The hydrogeology of the Black Hills area is very complex. Several
   regional, artesian bedrock aquifers and various local aquifers are
   exposed and recharged in the Black Hills area. The bedrock aquifers are
   separated by confining units, which are composed of less permeable
   rocks. The thickness and permeability of aquifers and confining units
   are known to change with location (Peter, 1985; Kyllonen and Peter,
   1987; Greene, 1993). Numerous fractures, faults, and solution cavities
   allow flow of water in rocks that otherwise are relatively impermeable.
   This is especially true of the Madison Limestone, which is well known
   for its karst features, including sinkholes and water-loss zones in
   streams, collapse features, solution cavities, and caves. Surface- and
   ground-water resources are connected by water-loss zones in streams and
   by large springs originating from one or more aquifers. Development of
   ground-water resources may affect surface-water resources. Conversely,
   development or contamination of surface-water resources may affect
   ground water. Detailed hydrogeologic information is necessary for
   effective management of water resources in the Black Hills area.

   To address the need for regional hydrogeologic information, the Black
   Hills Hydrology Study was initiated in 1990 as a long-term
   investigation (about 10 years) designed to assess the quantity,
   quality, and distribution of surface- and ground-water resources of the
   Black Hills area. The Black Hills Hydrology Study is a cooperative
   effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the South Dakota
   Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and the West
   Dakota Water Development District (West Dakota). West Dakota serves as
   the primary local cooperating agency and represents various local and
   county cooperators. West Dakota is assisted in this capacity by a
   steering committee consisting of area residents and representatives of
   various local governmental agencies. The steering committee also
   provides guidance for the Black Hills Water Management Study, which is
   an ongoing, companion study performed by the U.S. Bureau of
   Reclamation.
