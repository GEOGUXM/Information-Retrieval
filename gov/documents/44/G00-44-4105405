   Atmospheric and Climate Sciences (EES-8)
   Group Leader: Howard Hanson | Group Members
   Description

   The EES Atmospheric and Climate Sciences Group is Los Alamos National
   Laboratorys atmospheric and oceanic research capability. Its portfolio
   includes basic and applied research that covers a variety of technical
   areas, including
     * global and regional atmospheric and oceanic circulations;
     * atmospheric radiation measurements;
     * detection of infrasonic disturbances in the atmosphere, such as
       those caused by explosions and meteor impacts;
     * local and regional scale meteorology including the effects of
       complex terrain and localized heat sources such as wildfires;
     * emergency response;
     * atmospheric and oceanic chemistry and biogeochemistry; and
     * urban air quality.

   EES-8 maintains capabilities in modeling that range from local to
   global scales using state-of-the-art codes and high-performance
   computing. Our observational capabilities include conventional
   meteorological instrumentation; infrasound detectors; remote sensing
   with lidar, radar, and sodar systems; and a sophisticated suite of
   instruments for solar and terrestrial radiation measurements.

   Programs and Projects

   Simulating the Atmosphere and Ocean
     * Small-scale Atmospheric Modeling
       Originally motivated by the need to improve understanding of
       atmospheric flows over the extremely complex terrain of the Los
       Alamos site, small-scale atmospheric modeling in EES-8 has grown in
       sophistication in parallel with the growth in computing power.
       Currently, it involves efforts to improve the representation of
       turbulent flow in regions of high gradients and to include in these
       computations real-world physics and chemistry.
       One success of this development effort has been the emergence of
       models to simulate the behavior of wildfire. This has matured to
       include a full-physics combustion code in an advanced numerical
       turbulence model, allowing a fully interactive computation between
       the fire and the local weather. Additional physical processes, such
       as radiative preheating of fuels, smoke emissions, and stochastic
       descriptions of flying, burning embers that start new fires have
       also been included.
       We can also apply this code to atmospheric dispersion problems.
       This approach was used to show that concerns about a NASA Space
       Shuttle abort procedure, raised on the basis of overly simplified
       plume model computations, were less problematic than originally
       thought. More recently, we began a new effort with the Dynamic
       Experimentation Division at Los Alamos to understand the dispersion
       of high-explosive test effluents in the complex terrain of the LANL
       site.
       Work of this nature includes investigating flow and dispersion in
       urban settingsin street canyons and around buildingsas part of
       the DOE chemical-biological threat reduction effort. The activities
       are further documenting the failure of traditional Lagrangian-plume
       dispersion models in complicated circumstances.
     * Large-Scale Climate Modeling Ocean circulation codes
       EES-8 involvement in larger-scale modeling of the atmosphere and
       the ocean continues to grow. The suite of ocean circulation codes
       resident at LANL now includes the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean
       Model (MICOM) and the LANL Parallel Ocean Program (POP). POP has
       been adopted by the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) project
       at National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) for the
       next-generation coupled global climate model, and it is anticipated
       that future developments (notably, the hybrid combination of POP
       and MICOM into the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Circulation Model) will
       also become modules in the CCSM. When DOE funding becomes
       available, LANL will join with NCAR and LLNL in a global model
       development and applications consortium.
       In addition to our focus on oceanic modeling, EES-8 also has a
       strong capability in atmospheric modeling, particularly on regional
       scales. Simulations of atmospheric behavior on the scale of
       individual watersheds, for example, has a strong connection to
       water resource issues on these scales. The Regional Atmospheric
       Modeling System (RAMS) is being used to simulate precipitation over
       the Rio Grande Valley to show the connection between preferred
       locations for rain- and snow-fall and the topography. This study
       also shows clearly the need for resolution of at least 5 km for
       correctly simulating these processes..
     * Electrical Phenomena in the Atmosphere
       Interest in atmospheric electrification at Los Alamos has a long
       history, derived from the days of atmospheric nuclear testing. The
       electromagnetic pulse (EMP) associated with a nuclear detonation
       would, given the increase in communications satellites since the
       days of testing, cause far more damage than was envisioned in the
       early studies. Some of the same processes affecting the propagation
       of EMP through the atmosphere occur in natural electrification
       processes, and these are the subject of more recent study at EES-8.
       For years, airline pilots reported the existence of strange,
       colored lights emanating from the tops of thunderstorms, and in the
       early 1990s, these were documented in the scientific literature as
       upward electrical discharges. The mechanisms of these "red sprites"
       and "blue jets" are now being investigated using advanced numerical
       models.

   Atmospheric Instrumentation
     * Clouds and Climate: ARM
       The DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program emphasizes
       the role of clouds in modifying solar and terrestrial radiation
       streams and, thus, the climate. ARMs emphasis on three climatic
       regimes has provided instrument specialists with a variety of
       technical challenges. LANL has been responsible for the development
       of the sites on tropical atolls in the equatorial western Pacific
       basin since the programs inception, and now has two sites
       operational.
     * Small-Scale Atmospheric Imaging
       Laser applications have a long history at LANL, and one of the more
       innovative of these has been the development of a mobile, scanning
       Raman lidar system. Unlike backscatter lidar systems, a Raman
       system measures photons emitted by stimulated water vapor molecules
       in the atmosphere. The combination of these measurements with the
       simulation capabilities of HIGRAD presents an extremely powerful
       tool for understanding the behavior of the atmospheric surface
       layer and its interactions with the underlying vegetation or other
       surface characteristics.
     * Monitoring Infrasound
       Sound waves below the threshold of human hearing (that is, below
       about 10 Hz, called infrasound) are generated by a variety of
       phenomena, including avalanches, tornadoes, and natural explosions
       from meteorites (bolides), as well as nuclear explosions. EES-8
       operates and maintains an array of infrasound monitoring arrays as
       part of the international Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
       Organizations programs. These arrays consist of a triangle of
       low-frequency microphones, with an additional microphone placed in
       the center of the triangle, all of which are protected by
       wind-noise filters and weather-proof housings. The data from the
       four microphones are multiplexed and transmitted, by various means,
       to a central data processing facility for analysis. Civilian
       applications of this monitoring system include the use of the
       system, in combination with traditional methods, to monitor for
       earthquakes, to pinpoint the location and post-snowstorm timing of
       avalanches, and to listen for other related phenomena in remote
       locations.

   Partnerships
   EES-8 is working within the Laboratory and collaborating with external
   partners to develop relationships that apply its capabilities to
   interdisciplinary problems of relevance to DOE mandates.
   One example of this was discussed briefly above, the ongoing
   collaboration with a variety of organizations in the area of ocean
   modeling applied to climate change issues. A second example that is now
   being developed concerns the need for increased understanding of the
   global water cycle. EES-8 is working with scientists in two other EES
   groups and with the CCS Division on the development of a regional
   test-bed center for southwestern hydrology.

   A Vision of the Future
   As LANLs meteorology and oceanography research and development
   capability, EES-8 seeks to meet the Laboratorys current and future
   needs for expertise in these subject areas as they apply to
   national-security, environmental, and energy-related research programs.
   Because the atmosphere and oceans interact strongly with other
   components of the Earth System, and because a variety of tools is
   needed in this research, EES-8 works closely with other groups in the
   EES Division and other divisions on meeting the needs of these
   programs. By taking an integrated approach to understanding the
   interactive components of the Earth system, EES-8 will play an
   increasingly important role in the efforts to understand and predict
   global change, particularly the role of society in modifying the global
   environment, and the implications of weather- and climate-related
   hazards for society.
