   The California Integrated Waste Management Board believes that through
   education, current and future waste generators will respect and
   conserve natural resources by making informed waste prevention choices.
   Part of the CIWMBs mission is to provide educational materials on the
   topic of waste management to Californias public schools. To promote
   waste prevention, the Board's Office of Integrated Education is
   involved in several environmental education projects. For more
   information, select from the menu on the left.
