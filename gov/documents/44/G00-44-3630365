                           Whalewatching Behaviors




   [blow.jpg]

Blow or Spout

   While a whale is holding its breath, air is compressed in its chest.
   Upon reaching the surface, the air is exhaled through the whale's
   blowholes. The exhaled air expands, causing the temperature to
   decrease, thereby condensing into water vapor. This puff of white vapor
   is quite visible and can often reach heights of 20 feet. In concert
   with the blow is the sound of rushing air that can be heard up to 800
   feet away. The blow of a humpback whale is unique to each animal and a
   great way to distinguish between types of whales. On average, adult
   humpback whales take a breath every ten to fifteen minutes, but can
   remain submerged for as long as forty-five minutes. Calves must rise to
   the surface every three to five minutes to breathe.

Round Out or Peduncle Arch

   When preparing for a deep dive, humpbacks will arch their back and
   raise their tail flukes above the water. It is this pronounced arching
   of the back that has earned the humpback whale its common name.

Pec Slap

   The humpback's pectoral fin is longer than that of all other species of
   whales, measuring one-third the whale's body length, or approximately
   twelve to fifteen feet. Humpbacks will often roll onto their side or
   back and slowly slap the water's surface with one fin or both fins
   simultaneously. The slapping of fins may serve as a communication
   signal to other whales.

Head Rise or Spy Hop

   A whale slowly rises vertically toward the surface, poking its head out
   of the water to just below its eyes. Some believe this behavior allows
   the humpback whale to get a better look at activity going on above the
   surface.

Tail Slap

   A tail slap consists of a whale raising its tail flukes out of the
   water and slapping them forcefully on the surface of the water. When
   the flukes hit the water, a loud resonant noise can be heard for miles.
   Humpback whales are known to repeat this behavior over and over. This
   behavior may serve as a warning to others in the vicinity.

Peduncle Slap or Lobtail

   An aggressive display where the humpback whale will thrash the surface
   of the water by whipping its upraised flukes from side to side.
   Humpbacks will slap the surface of the water as a warning signal to
   others or bash other whales during aggressive competition.

Breach

   A powerful acrobatic display where the humpback uses its tail to launch
   itself out of the water. With just a few pumps of its tail, the
   humpback can propel its entire body into the air, landing back onto the
   surface with a resounding splash. The purpose of this spectacular
   behavior is still unclear. Some suggest it allows the whale to dislodge
   barnacles and other parasites from its body, serves as a form of
   communication, or maybe just a form of playful activity for the
   humpback.
