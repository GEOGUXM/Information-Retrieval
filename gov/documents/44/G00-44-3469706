   Templates: USGS ArcIMS HTML Template
   Articles The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has developed an
   ArcIMS web page template for use by all USGS web developers. This
   template, based on the ArcIMS 3.1 HTML Viewer, is designed to provide a
   consistent user interface to USGS interactive maps published on the
   Internet. The template addresses handicap accessibility (American
   Disabilities Act, Section 508) and conforms to USGS Visual Identity
   standards. A configuration utility is included so that the web
   developer can quickly and easily publish a customized interactive map.

   The template is intended for USGS web developers creating a web page
   with the following characteristics:
     * Accessible by the public
     * The map interface is a non-entry level page
     * No user information will be collected on the map interface page
     * The map interface page is not specifically designed for children
     * Uses ArcIMS map services

   Included with the template is a configuration utility allowing
   customization of the following parameters:
     * Map Title
     * Whether or not to include an overview image
     * Map services and hostnames
     * Initial geographic limits
     * Web page maintainer information in the footer
     * Local organization information in the footer
     * Colors for the banner and page elements
     * The appearance of various tools

   Choose the following links to see examples of web pages created with
   the template:
    1. Geographic Names Information System
    2. National Elevation Dataset
    3. National Elevation Dataset Data Source Index
    4. National Hydrography Dataset
    5. National Land Cover Dataset
    6. USGS Reference Layers
    7. USGS Combined Map Services

   The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) has developed an ArcIMS site at
   http://www.npms.rspa.dot.gov/. The site is based on the html template
   provided with the ArcIMS software, but has been modified for look and
   feel.
   Is there a way to retro-fit the functionality and 508-compliant
   components of the USGS template to bring a pre-existing site into
   compliance with Section 508? Will OPS ultimately have to rebuild the
   site? Any thoughts would be appreciated.
