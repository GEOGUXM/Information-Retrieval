   Undergraduate Fellowship


   The Undergraduate Student Fellowship enhances the education of students
   majoring in science, mathematics, engineering, technology, or other
   areas that support the mission of the INEEL. The awards are made
   available through funding from the Department of Energy and the INEEL.
   These fellowships provide an intensive introduction to mission support
   areas through the guidance of experienced mentors. Students are
   selected based on their chosen field of study (major) that matches the
   project description.
   Eligibility This program is open to students who have completed their
   freshman year and are currently enrolled as a full-time student. All
   awards are contingent upon security access approval by the INEEL Office
   of Personnel Security. Participants will not be allowed at the INEEL
   until this approval is given. U.S. Citizenship or Permanent Resident
   Alien status is required. Applicant must maintain a cumulative GPA of
   3.0/4.0.
   Qualifications Applicants will be reviewed on the basis of academic
   performance and class standing, career goals, recommendations, and
   compatibility of educational interests and abilities with the needs of
   the INEEL.
   Duration The fellowship term is 10-16 weeks for summer appointments and
   a minimum of 15 weeks for academic semester appointments. Renewals are
   competitive and require a yearly updated application.
   Award A fellowship award includes placement on a project with a stipend
   starting at $1,500/month for a summer award or $3,000 total stipend for
   an academic semester award. Optional allowances for travel to and from
   the facility, housing, and relocation may be included in the award.
   Participants are encouraged to seek academic credit at their home
   institution. For students located at the college/university, stipend
   amount is based on the university standard. Stipends are disbursed on
   the last business day of the month (excluding Fridays).
   Health
   Insurance Each participant is required to obtain coverage under a
   health insurance plan. It is the responsibility of each participant to
   secure his or her own insurance coverage before arriving at the
   appointment site.
