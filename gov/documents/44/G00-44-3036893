Travel Warnings & Consular Information Sheets

   Travel Warnings are issued when the State Department decides, based on
   all relevant information, to recommend that Americans avoid travel to a
   certain country. Countries where avoidance of travel is recommended
   will have Travel Warnings as well as Consular Information Sheets.

   Public Announcements are a means to disseminate information about
   terrorist threats and other relatively short-term and/or trans-national
   conditions posing significant risks to the security of American
   travelers.

   Consular Information Sheets are available for every country of the
   world. They include such information as location of the U.S. Embassy or
   Consulate in the subject country, unusual immigration practices, health
   conditions, minor political disturbances, unusual currency and entry
   regulations, crime and security information, and drug penalties.

   Commemorative Stamp -- Nobel Peace Prize

A New Century Of Stamps

   America's commemorative stamp program will have something for everyone
   this year when the U.S. Postal Service introduces a colorful array of
   interesting and educational designs presented as "A New Century of
   Stamps."

   "U.S. postage stamps are a reflection of the American experience," said
   Postmaster General William Henderson. "For more than 150 years, stamps
   have helped the Postal Service facilitate communications both uniformly
   and universally, and their bold, often inspiring subjects and designs
   continue to bring history to life."

   The U.S. Postal Service has all the details on the 2001 commemorative
   stamp program, including stamps featuring civil rights activist Roy
   Wilkins, Peanuts, American Illustrators, and many more.
