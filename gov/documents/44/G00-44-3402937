                  A National Laboratory for basic research
                  on the chemistry, physics, and biology of
                  salt-affected soil-plant-water systems .

   The Mission of our staff:
   To develop, through research, new knowledge, and technology, the
   solution of problems of crop production on salt-affected lands, to
   promote the sustainability of irrigated agriculture, and to prevent
   degradation of surface- and ground-water resources by salts,
   toxic-elements, pesticides, and pathogens.

   In addition to increasing the quantity of the food supply, irrigation
   agriculture contributes to the diversity of agricultural products. An
   extensive proportion of the fruits, nuts, and vegetables are produced
   on irrigated lands. Irrigation agriculture also contributes to forage,
   fiber, industrial (paper, rubber, resins, solvents, etc.), medicinal,
   and ornamental products.

   The research provided by the George E. Brown Jr. Salinity Laboratory
   will play an ever increasing role in meeting these challenges of a
   future faced with the problems of ever increasing world population and
   ever decreasing and more marginal soil and water resources.

   The George E. Brown Jr. Salinity Laboratory, aided by its new,
   state-of-the-art
   facility, continues to provide world leadership in salinity research
   through the combined efforts of three interactive research units:
     * Soil-Water Chemistry and Assessment
     * Soil Physics-Pesticides
     * Plant Sciences

   Each of our three research units
   consists of
     * Research Leader
     * Lead Scientists
            assisted by
     * Support Scientists
     * Post-Doctoral researchers
     * Technicians
     * Secretarial staff
     * Part-time student assistants from the UC-Riverside campus.


    Research is done by scientists working on individual projects, with
   team-cooperation among scientists of one or more research units.

   Analytical laboratories  are equipped for rapid organic and inorganic
   analysis of soil, water, and plant samples,
     * A  Pesticide Residue laboratory  provides instrumentation capable
       of parts-per-trillion (ppt) detection of pesticide vapors, and
       residues in soil, water, and air samples,
     * A  Scanning Electron Microscope facilityprovides direct X-Ray
       Spectroscopy of soil and plant surfaces.
     * Networked computer facilities enhance personal efficiency, and
       communication within the research units, with scientists at the
       University of California, and scientists around the world.

   Soil salinity and reclamation research is  frequently conducted in
   cooperation with faculty members from the
   Department of Environmental Sciences (University of California,
   Riverside)
