   Hazardous Materials Packaging and Transportation Service

      To better serve the NCI scientific community, a Hazardous Materials
      Courier service has been established for users of the NCI-Frederick
      Research Technology Program (RTP). By utilizing the courier to
      transport potentially hazardous chemical, biological or radiological
      materials, RTP users are assured of compliance with federal
      transportation laws. Our couriers are certified in all aspects of
      hazardous shipping and meet all U.S. Department of Transportation and
      international requirements. In operating this service, the
      NCI-Frederick assumes all liability for the transport of dangerous
      goods between NIH-Bethesda and NCI-Frederick. The courier service can
      be scheduled by completing the NCI-Frederick's Request for Shipment
      form. This form must be submitted electronically and printed, signed
      and faxed to the Environment, Health and Safety Program at 301-846-6269
      at least 24 hours prior to the day of shipment. Upon receipt of the
      authorized form, the courier will pick up, package, label and deliver
      your samples with appropriate documentation to the designated
      NCI-Frederick laboratory. The fee for service is $30 per package.

      All shipments must comply fully with federal and state laws that govern
      the transport of hazardous materials. Noncompliance with applicable
      regulations may be subject to legal penalties.
