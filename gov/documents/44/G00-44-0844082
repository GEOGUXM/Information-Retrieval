   The interest rate for federal judgments is based on the average prices
   for 52-week Treasury bills.
   (See 28 U.S.C. § 1961 and 40 U.S.C. § 258(e)(1))

   The post-judgment interest rate for judgments recorded from January 28,
   2002 through February 3, 2002, is

                                    2.18%

   If you need the latest rate before it is posted here, the Federal
   Reserve posts selected interest rates weekly on their web site. Find
   the preceding week's average for US government securities, 1-year
   treasury constant maturities on the current selected interest rates
   page.

   Post-judgment interest rates for earlier judgments may be determined by
