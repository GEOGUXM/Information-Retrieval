                   Program Name: Los Alamos Summer School

   Driver and Mission/Goals of the Program:
          The overall goal is to attract top-level talent into research
          careers in the physical and computational sciences. The
          immediate objectives are to convey to top-ranked upper-level
          undergraduate students a sense of the excitement and importance
          of scientific research, especially of research currently
          conducted at Los Alamos, including our contributions to national
          and international security through the science-based stockpile
          stewardship program. The program is a jointly operated
          educational initiative between the University of New Mexico and
          the Laboratory.

   Brief Description of Program:
          The Summer School program extends for 10 weeks and is divided
          into two parts: (1) a mentored research project and (2) a
          seminar series. The mentored project introduces students to the
          basic process of scientific research. The seminar series
          consists of a set of lectures, given by staff and visiting
          scientists, that focuses on hot topics in a variety of fields of
          physics. Students are paid for their participation in the
          program.

   Targeted Participants or Audience:
          Top-ranked upper-level undergraduates at US universities.

                                Program Name:
      Los Alamos Student Program in Mathematical Modeling and Analysis

   Driver and Mission/Goals of the Program:
          The program¡s main objective is to stimulate students¡ interests
          in interdisciplinary applied mathematics, computer science and
          mathematical physics research. The program is designed to
          attract academically superior graduate students in science and
          engineering and to offer these students hands-on research
          experience in mathematical modeling and analysis, as well as
          access to the extensive scientific resources at Los Alamos. The
          program immerses students in the research, development, and use
          of advanced mathematical models, computational techniques and
          computer science research. The long-term goal of the program is
          to foster development of a technically sophisticated future
          workforce with the interest, skills, and experience to pursue
          careers in areas related to applied mathematics, computer
          science, and mathematics physics.

   Brief Description of the Program:
          This program is affiliated with the Laboratory¡s Graduate
          Research Assistant (GRA) program and is open on a competitive
          basis to all university graduate students. Student internships
          are based on the academic qualifications and the scientific
          interests of the applicant, the benefit to the applicant, and
          the availability of a Los Alamos mentor to sponsor the research.
          The selection procedure attempts to match specific openings with
          an applicant's interests and abilities in order to complement
          the student's education with research related to his/her field
          of study. During their internship, students work on a mentored
          research project and are required to give a research talk on
          their project. Most students also write a Laboratory report on
          the results of their project. A summary of 1999 summer projects
          can be found at

   Targeted participants or audience:
          Academically superior graduate students in science and
          engineering
