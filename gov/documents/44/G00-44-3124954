                     Information on SEG Related Servers

   This is an information page about the new servers. It includes
   information about the servers themselves, their usage, and their setup.
   If there is anything you find missing or lacking, please let Sue McLean

                             General Information

                               Top of the Page

   Apex, Zenith(www.ngdc.noaa.gov):
   These are the two machines that share the www duties, replacing julius.
       There are not any logins on apex or zenith, all development should
       occur on meridian. Cgi's,html pages, and data files are moved from
       meridian to apex and zenith. For SEG, you must submit the files to
       be moved via the the m2www transfer program. Apex and zenith are
       identical to users - you won't be able to tell the difference.
       There is a 100 slot cdrom tower mounted on each of the machines. If
       you need to mount a new cd on the web, you must provide two copies
       to Sue McLean. This co-server setup provides a backup machine
       should one machine crash.

   Meridian:
   Meridian is the web development server for the data center. Everyone
       should have a login onto meridian. In order to have something
       placed on the www servers, you must submit it at the m2www
       submittal page. Meridian is not servable to the outside world. This
       means that if you give someone outside of ngdc an url to meridian,
       they won't be able to see it. Meridian also hosts the NGDC
       intranet. See http://meridian/intranet. Queeg still hosts the SEG
       intranet- see queeg below. On Meridian, anything placed in the
       /net/ftp/Solid_Earth/ directory will be mirrored to apex and zenith
       once an hour. Meridian's ftp area does not accept anonymous logins.
       If you need to place something in anonymous ftp, you must actually
       ftp to ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov and place it there.

   Borealis(idl.ngdc.noaa.gov):
   Borealis is the idl server for the data center. This machine only runs
       code that is used on the web. This machine is not intended for
       development work.The current version of idl installed is 5.1. The
       machine is a dual PentiumII 233, running RedHat Linux v5.1. Mark
       Sleeper is the main administrator.

   Picasso:
   Picasso is the development idl server for SEG. It is running RedHat
       Linux 5.1 on a Pentium II 300. If you need an account please see
       Mark Sleeper (mos@ngdc.noaa.gov).

   Queeg(hypernews.ngdc.noaa.gov):
   Queeg is the misc. web server. It should only be seen as
       hypernews.ngdc.noaa.gov to the outside world. It also hosts the SEG
       Intranet, personal home pages for SEG, IAGA and WDC webcrossing
       pages, and the IAGA devlopment site, along with HyperNews. It is a
       linux box.

                         New Concepts and Procedures

                               Top of the Page

   There are several new ideas and procedures that we are using on the new
   web servers. The descriptions are listed below.
     * Server Side Includes (SSI)
        This is a method of providing uniformity among the pages of our
            site, along with providing ease of changing the standard
            headers/footers. Given a standard page with a header and a
            footer, normally you would copy the header and footer out of
            the template page to your document. The problem is if the
            footer is changed, then every document that has the footer in
            it has to be changed. With SSI, a comment line tells the web
            server to include a specified footer at that point in the
            document. This allows us to have one copy of the footer
            arround that many can use, and there is only one footer to
            modify. Any file that has SSI's should end in .shtml vs .html
            so the server knows to do the SSI. If you have any questions,
            please see Susan McLean (sjm@ngdc.noaa.gov) or Mark Sleeper
            (mos@ngdc.noaa.gov). See the template page for an example.
     * The Conf Directory
        The idea of the conf directory is to place a number of files that
            contain path information in the same place on every machine.
            If we have to change machines, we just have to change the path
            information in the configuration files instead of in all of
            the programs. The conf directory will always be located at
            /usr/local/lib/seg/. The files in this directory will be asci
            files containing path info. The more we utilize these the
            easier porting to a new machine will be. If you have any
            questions please see Susan McLean (sjm@ngdc.noaa.gov).
     * Relative Links
        Please make all links to other documents in our web site relative.
            If the links are relative, then the pages are server
            independant (A very good thing).
            examples:
          + static: http://queeg.ngdc.noaa.gov/local/move.htm
          + relative: /local/move.html
