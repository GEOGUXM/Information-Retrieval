     The Orange County Community Indicators Project annually measures the
     overall quality of life of the Orange County community by tracking
     key indicators of economic, social and environmental wellbeing.
     Modeled after successful programs in the state and nation, the
     Community Indicators Project serves as an ongoing and dynamic
     measurement tool which can support a variety of local and regional
     initiatives concerned with the wellbeing of the county.

     With the help and commitment of key stakeholders and numerous
     contributors throughout the county, the project has successfully
     produced two reports since 1999. The response has been encouraging.
     We hope you will find the reports useful and thought provoking. We
     invite you to share them with others interested in sustaining Orange
     County's long-term health and quality of life.

     Community input is very important to the success of this effort. You
     can contact project representatives by calling (714) 834-7257 or
     sending an email to ocindicators@ocgov.com.
