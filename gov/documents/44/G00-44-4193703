Technical Activities

   The Materials Reliability Division is one of five divisions in the
   Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory of the National Institute
   of Standards and Technology (NIST). The Materials Reliability Division
   develops measurement technologies which enable the producers and users
   of materials to improve the quality and reliability of their products.
   Measurement technologies are developed for process control to improve
   the quality and consistency of materials, nondestructive evaluation to
   assure quality of finished materials and products, and materials
   evaluation to assure reliable performance. Within these broad areas of
   measurement technology, the Division has focused its resources on
   several research themes.
