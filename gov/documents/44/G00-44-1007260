   Ionizing Radiation Division


   About the Ionization and Radiation Division
   The Division, part of NIST's Physics Laboratory, develops maintains and
   desiminates the national standards for ionzing radiation and
   radioactivity.

                               Research Areas
        The Ionizing Radiation Division is divided into three groups:

   - Radiation Interactions and Dosimetry Group: develops, maintains, and
      disseminates the national measurement standards for the dosimetry of
     x rays, gamma rays, and electrons, and engages in research on radiation
     interactions and effects to meet requirements for new standards and to
            address the needs of industry, medicine, and government.

   - Neutron Interactions and Dosimetry Group: develops, maintains, and
        disseminates accurate standards for neutron dosimetry and neutron
      interactions measurements, and engages in research on neutron physics
                         metrology to meet future needs.

   -       Radioactivity Group: develops, maintains and disseminates
     radioactivity standards, develops and applies radioactivity measurement
      techniques and engages in research on radionuclide metrology to meet
                                  future needs.

   Top left image is a normal radiographic image of the yellow jacket wasp
   shown in the center. The bottom right image is a neutron phase contrast
                           image of the same wasp.
