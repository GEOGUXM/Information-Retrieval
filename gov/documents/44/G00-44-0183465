   A Sampling of Engineerings Top Projects

   National Ignition Facility target chamber National Ignition Facility

   The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is a 192-beam, 1.8 MJ laser to be
   used for science-based stockpile stewardship, to demonstrate the
   viability of fusion energy for civilian power production and to conduct
   basic high energy-density physics research.

   For more information, see the construction page of the NIF website.


   Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography collage Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography

   Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography can be described as a process of using
   very short wavelength light to significantly decrease the line widths
   of feature sizes to produce computer chips 10 times faster and with
   1000 times more memory than todays chip.

   For more information, see the EUV lithography website.


   Large-optics diamond-turning machine Large-Optics Diamond-Turning
   Machine

   The Large-Optics Diamond-Turning Machine (LODTM) is a precision
   two-axis, vertical-axis lathe that can machine parts up to 64 inches in
   diameter, 20 inches in length, and 3000 pounds in weight. The LODTM is
   an order of magnitude more accurate than other machine tools of its
   working volume. Designed to turn aspheric mirrors for high-energy
   chemical lasers, it can machine metal to a mirror-smooth accuracy to
   within one millionth of an inch.


   Computer simulation ParaDyn

   ParaDyn is a parallel solid/structural mechanics computer program for
   simulating complex mechanical systems. The ParaDyn program is running
   on the ASCI computers at LLNL. Engineers are now able to run problems
   in days that in the past required months on computers with only one
   processor. With ParaDyn, automobile accident calculations are now
   possible because of parallel computing.

   For more information, see the Methods Development Groups website.


   National Transparent Optical Network National Transparent Optical
   Network

   The National Transparent Optical Network (NTON) project is building a
   community of the leading academic, government, and private sector
   research laboratories on the west coast. The team--Nortel, LLNL, GST
   Telecomm, Sprint, and Bay Area Rapid Transitstarted the project in the
   Bay Area in 1996. A prototype includes a greater than 1-gb/s network to
   support high bandwidth applications development and network research
   for the Next Generation Internet initiative.

   For more information, see the NTON webpage.


   Subcritical experiments Subcritical Experiments

   Subcritical experiments are a B-program activity to evaluate the
   dynamic response of plutonium when subjected to a high explosive shock.
   Conducted underground at the Nevada Test Site, these experiments
   utilize engineering leadership in many areas: Plutonium sample
   preparation, experimental hardware and system development, Nevada Test
   Site fielding support, and a primary role in assuring safety in all
   operations.


   High-performance Electromagnetic Roadway Measurement and Evaluation
   System High-performance Electromagnetic Roadway Measurement and
   Evaluation System (HERMES)

   HERMES is a revolutionary technology developed by Lawrence Livermore
   National Laboratory, under the guidance and sponsorship of the Federal
   Highway Administration (FHWA).
     * HERMES inspects bridge decks at up to highway speeds.
     * HERMES uses an array of 64 ultra-wideband radars for imaging and
       inspecting a two-meter-wide swath of a bridge deck in a single
       pass.
     * Unlike other technologies for bridge inspection, HERMES generates a
       fully-3D picture of a bridge deck interior through a novel
       diffraction tomography technique. The 3D images enable the operator
       to recognize concrete anomalies as deep as 30 cm.
     * HERMES is a 1998 R&D 100 Award-winning technology that provides
       more reliable diagnostics to reduce uncertainty in the repair
       contracting process, thereby saving millions of dollars.

   For more information, see the HERMES website or visit the Federal
   Highway Administration website.


   Peacekeeper W87/Mk21 Peacekeeper

   In May, LLNL Engineering conducted the first-ever combined flight test
   of a high-fidelity simulated warhead with on-board instrumentation. The
   W87/Air Force Peacekeeper missile flew from Vandenberg Air Force Base
   to the Kwajalein Missile Range.
