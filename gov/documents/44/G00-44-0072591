                                 Glaciology

   Glaciology is a scientific discipline concerned with the study of ice
   in all of its forms, structures, and physical and chemical properties.
   It includes the study of all crystalline phases of ice in its purest
   forms and its natural occurrences in glaciers and ice sheets on earth,
   other planets, moons, comets, and planetary ring systems. Glaciologists
   are also interested in all processes where ice is directly or
   indirectly involved. The dynamics of ice flow in glaciers and ice
   streams is an important subject of research. Freezing and melting
   processes and all interactions of ice with the environment have obvious
   applications and need to be understood, including the formation of
   clouds, hail, sleet, and all forms of snow, sea ice, lake ice, ice
   shelves, and icebergs. Ice plays an important role in climatic change,
   in the ice ages, and the rising and falling of global sea level.

   Glaciological research uses all methods and instruments developed in
   the earth and planetary sciences. The cryobot is an ambitious new tool
   to expand the reach of our scientific methods into new territory of
   exploration. The ultimate goal is to better understand the rich and
   multifaceted phenomenon ICE and its often hidden secrets.
