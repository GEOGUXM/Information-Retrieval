  A Scaled Experiment to Study the Final Focus in a Heavy Ion Fusion (HIF)
                                   Driver

   To compress a fusion target to the conditions necessary for initiation
   of the fusion reaction, all of the energy present in the accelerated
   ion beams must be directed to a very small region.  The typical HIF
   target is a small cylinder surrounding an even smaller sphere of fusion
   fuel.  The ends of the cylinder are made of a materials that convert
   the ion beam energy into x-ray energy to heat and compress the target;
   these "converters" would have a diameter of approximately 6-8
   centimeters.  This is the size of the "bulls eye" that beams with
   thousands of amps of current must hit.

   A straightforward approach to this problem is to use quadrupole fields
   to focus the beam onto the target. Ballistic focusing, where the ion
   beam is mostly un-neutralized as it approaches the fusion target is
   considered a baseline method. A series of specially designed quadrupole
   magnets is placed at the end of the accelerator.  These magnets produce
   a conically converging beam with a cone half angle of about 1Â°, causing
   the beam diameter to shrink to the size of the target as it reaches the
   center of the reactor chamber. This convergence angle must overcome the
   self repulsive forces of the beam ions (space charge) as well as their
   small random spread in transverse velocities (emittance).
   Such a system was part of the a report detailing a complete HIF power
   plant design.  It was this system that was chosen to be the subject of
   experimental study here at LBNL.  To obtain a relevant result, the
   scaled experiment should duplicate many of the physical properties in
   the design appropriate to focusing the beam.  In particular, the 100
   meter long system used in was modeled at one-tenth dimensional scale
   with magnets that have a 5 centimeter bore diameter inside a 10 meter
   vacuum system. (See figure 1)  The experimentally focused beam fit
   inside a 1mm diameter circle (figure 2).
   [figure2.jpg] Some driver designs call for beams which have so much
   force from the space charge that ballistic focusing by itself will not
   get the beam small enough to match the size of the target.  In this
   case, one could imagine using electrons within the beam to shield the
   forces of one ion against its neighbors; this is known as neutralizing
   the beam. We explored this technique experimentally by increasing the
   beam current by a factor of four, and then adding electrons to the beam
   by passing it near a hot tungsten wire (figure 4). Figure 3 shows the
   difference between the un-neutralized and neutralized focal spots.
