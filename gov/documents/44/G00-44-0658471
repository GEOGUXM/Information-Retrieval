   1.&#12;INTRODUCTION

   In this paper we present analyses of airflow evolution in the tornadic
   Newcastle, Texas, storm of 29 May 1994 (Wakimoto and Atkins 1996,
   referred to as paper WA), one focus of intensive mobile mesoscale field
   observations during the Verification of the Origins of Rotation in
   Tornadoes EXperiment or VORTEX (Rasmussen et al. 1994). Our goal is to
   document the evolution of low level rotation of the parent mesoscale
   circulation (i.e. mesocyclone) of the Newcastle tornado and gain
   insights into the origins of mesoscale rotation preceding
   tornadogenesis.

   2.&#12;OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS

   The Newcastle storm evolved from a line of deep convection that
   developed along a dryline in north-central Texas during mid-afternoon.
   In expectation of storm development, the NOAA P-3 was flying over north
   Texas as early as 1900 and began flying legs adjacent to developing
   cells around 2100 (all times are Universal Time). The P-3 flew a series
   of seven consecutive legs along the southwest flank of the Newcastle
   storm from 2240 until 2318, obtaining pseudo-dual Doppler tail radar
   data in the fore-aft scan or FAST mode (Jorgensen et al. 1996).
   Operated in 180Â° sector mode, the tail radar completed each fore or aft
   sweep in 3 seconds, corresponding to a nominal along-track data spacing
   of about 700 m.

   In post-analysis, radar data was extensively edited to remove ground
   targets and regions of atmospheric reflectivity less than about 10 dBZ,
   and velocities were dealiased using the NCAR Solo software. Since
   subsequent analysis would focus on the lower levels of the storm,
   editing was concentrated on the lowest 5 km AGL.

   In the next analysis step, radar data were spatially interpolated via
   the Barnes technique using a slightly modified form of the NCAR Reorder
   software. Radial velocities and reflectivities were interpolated to a
   51 x 51 x 21 regular cartesian grid with dimension of 25 x 25 x 5 km
   (i.e. 0.5 km horizontal and 0.25 km vertical grid spacing). The Barnes
   weighting function takes the form w = exp(-r^2/k ), where r is the
   distance from a gridpoint to a datum and k is a smoothing parameter.
   The frequency response of the Barnes weighting function may be
   expressed as D[0] = exp[-k * (p /l * )^2], where k = k * L^2, L = 2D ,
   and l * = l /L. Given a nominal horizontal (vertical) data spacing D =
   0.7 km (0.4 km), and picking a constant k * = 0.799, the theoretical
   horizontal (vertical) response of the Barnes filter is ~ 50% at
   wavelength l = 4.8 km (2.7 km) and near zero at the Nyquist wavelength
   L.

   In the final analysis step using the NCAR Cedric software, an iterative
   scheme was employed in combination with the two linear equations for
   the fore and aft scan radial velocities to vertically integrate the
   mass continuity equation from w = 0 at ground level. The following
   steps were taken to modify the interpolated radial velocities prior to
   integration: 1) hole filling; 2) two-step, 2-D Leise filtering of
   radial velocity fields.

   3.&#12;RESULTS

   The Newcastle storm began as an updraft on the west end of a bow-shaped
   echo which was driven by outflow convergence from the neighboring
   Graham storm (Fig. 1a). At this early stage the bow echo was anchored
   by two counter-rotating mesoscale vorticies (i.e. "bookend vorticies"),
   the Graham mesocyclone to the east with (x,y) coordinates (km) of
   (23,12), and an anticyclonic circulation at (16,13). The parent
   mesoscale circulation of the Newcastle tornado formed northwest of the
   inflow notch into the anticyclonic circulation at (14,14). Near ground
   and at all analysis times, the southwestern edge of the
   Newcastle-Graham complex marked the location of a westward-moving cold
   outflow boundary.

   tornado photo taken by lead author CLZ at 231213 looking ENE from P-3.
   Photogrammetric analysis of P-3 side-looking video is used to locate
   and size the tornado funnel and wall cloud in panel (f).

   With subsequent development, (Figs. 1b-f), the Graham mesocyclone moved
   southward while the Newcastle cell moved slowly westward, increased in
   reflectivity, and developed an intense mesocyclonic circulation. The
   Newcastle mesocyclone continued to intensify through 2302, the
   approximate onset time of damage to vegetation from strong surface
   winds (WA), through the time of the first tornado photo from a ground
   team around 2309. During the development of the mesovortex, especially
   after 2253, strong convective updrafts were noted within and on the
   inflow side of the circulation center.

   Vertical cross-sections through the location of maximum vertical
   vorticity in the developing Newcastle cell reveal the close
   correspondence of updraft and vertical mesocyclonic rotation (Fig. 2).
   As early as 2242 (Fig. 2a), a peak vertical vorticity of mesocyclone
   strength (i.e. 10 x 10^-3 s^-1) is located in the updraft around 5 km,
   with weaker rotation at lower levels. By 2250 (Fig. 2b), midlevel
   rotation in the updraft had more than doubled in strength while the
   first signs of a developing rear flank downdraft (RFD) were seen in the
   lowest three kilometers rough 1 km to the west of the mesocyclone.
   Vertical vorticity continued to increase through 2253 (Fig. 2c) and
   2301 (Fig. 2d), the most notable features being the development of a
   secondary maximum of vertical vorticity near ground, the persistent
   colocation of the mesocyclone and updraft, and the vigorous RFD to the
   west. The mesocyclone continued to intensify at all levels through 2305
   (Fig. 2e) to 2312 (Fig. 2f), when a maximum value of 34 x 10^-3 s^-1
   was analyzed around the location of the tornado. The analysis at 2315
   (not shown) reveals the same overall morphology and a slow westward
   movement of the mesocyclone.

   4.&#12;DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

   Motivated by WA who suggested that stretching of preexisting vertical
   vorticity along a mesoscale boundary intensified the Newcastle
   circulation and eventually initiated the tornado, we performed an
   analysis of vertical vorticity forcing by tilting and stretching.
   Departing somewhat from previous studies, we evaluated these forcing
   terms and the accumulated vorticity along short (~4 min) lagrangians
   approximating the motion of air entering the mesocyclone. The results
   suggest that air entered the updraft and intensifying mesocyclone at
   2253 from the east (e.g. trajectory in Figs. 1c and 2c) and was
   subsequently stretched to the observed mesocyclone intensity (Fig. 3).

   Fig. 3&#12;Time histories of vertical velocity, analyzed vertical
   vorticity
   (s^-1 x 10^-3), and predicted vertical vorticity along a short (4 min)
   streamline entering the Newcastle mesocyclone during its developing
   stage. Vertical vorticity is set to the observed value at the beginning
   of the trajectory, and both individual (TLT, STR) and total (TOT)
   tendencies are accumulated following the motion.

   It is difficult to explain the observed mesocyclogenesis leading to the
   Newcastle tornado as stretching of vertical vorticity along a
   preexisting boundary, in this case the westward-moving cold outflow.
   Our trajectory analysis suggests that air was entering the developing
   mesocyclone from the east (i.e. behind the outflow boundary. A portion
   of these E-W trajectories (not shown) entered the edge of the
   mesocyclone, became ingested into the wrapping rear flank downdraft
   (RFD), and were ultimately lifted and stretched as they passed from the
   RFD into the updraft.

   There are additional difficulties with the hypothesis that stretching
   of preexisting outflow boundary vorticity formed the Newcastle tornado.
   The Newcastle mesocyclone first appeared aloft, eventually building
   down to low levels where a secondary vorticity maximum developed prior
   to tornadogenesis. Moreover, the analysis revealed the updraft
   meso-anticyclone farther southeast along the outflow boundary that
   preceded the Newcastle mesocyclone. Obviously, any hypothesis of
   mesocyclogenesis would need to explain the observed sequence of
   development of the circulations of both signs.

   We are presently investigating the origins of the rather weak vertical
   vorticity to the east the outflow boundary and Newcastle mesocyclone.
   Our analyses reveal that some of the inflow air moved from a roughly
   annular region of negative vertical vorticity into the region of weak
   positive vertical vorticity surrounding the Newcastle mesocyclone (e.g.
   Fig. 2f). We are studying the possible role of tilting to move inflow
   air across the interface, and plan to report additional findings at the
   conference.
