   MBNMS Sanctuary Advisory Council (SAC) Home Page

      The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council was
      established by Federal law to assure continued public participation in
      the management of the Sanctuary. Since its establishment in March 1994,
      the Council has played a vital role in the decisions affecting the
      Sanctuary along the central California Coast. The Council's nineteen
      voting members represent a variety of local user groups, as well as the
      general public, plus seven local, state and federal governmental
      jurisdictions. In addition, the respective managers for the four
      California National Marine Sanctuaries (Channel Islands National Marine
      Sanctuary, Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary, Gulf of the
      Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, and the Monterey Bay National
      Marine Sanctuary) and the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research
      Reserve sit as non-voting members. Members are appointed competitively
      by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and serve
      three-year terms. The Council meets bi-monthly in open sessions located
      throughout the 360-mile boundary of the Sanctuary.

                                                               COUNCIL

      The Council has been active on behalf of marine resource protection for

      matters and policy decisions. The following list includes major issues

        * Advisory Council Charter and Protocols
        * State Mussel Watch Program

      The Council is supported by three working groups: the Research Activity
      Panel (RAP) chaired by Gregor Cailliet, the Sanctuary Education Panel
      (SEP) chaired by Patricia Clark-Gray, and the Conservation Working
      Group (CWG) chaired by Vicki Nichols, each respectively dealing with
      matters concerning research, education and resource protection. The
      working groups are composed of experts from the appropriate fields of
      interest and all meet monthly, serving as invaluable advisors to the
      Council and the Sanctuary Superintendent.

      Several task forces have been established to assist in developing
      specific programmatic goals. Most notable is the formation of the
      Business and Tourism Activity Panel (BTAP), whose purpose is to
      strengthen economic partnerships with the Sanctuary Program.

      Dedicated Council members have laid a strong foundation for the
      Sanctuary's structure, policies, and procedures. Sanctuary goals to
      promote research, education and resource protection are a major focus
      for the Council, and members work diligently to promote public
      stewardship. The Council has proven to be a powerful voice for the
      general public, responding to citizen concerns, ideas and needs. The
      Council provides a public forum for its constituents, working to
      enhance communications and provide a conduit for bringing the concerns
      of user groups and stakeholders to the attention of Sanctuary managers
      and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Headquarters in
      Washington, D.C.

      The Council maintains a firm commitment to the goals and objectives of
      the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Program. The Council
      appreciates the efforts of volunteers, non-profit organizations,
      businesses, and citizens, without whose support the mission of the
      Sanctuary would be difficult to realize.
