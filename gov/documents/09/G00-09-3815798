   Welcome to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) home page. OSC is an
independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency. Our primary
mission is to safeguard the merit system by protecting federal employees and
applicants from prohibited personnel practices, especially reprisal for
whistleblowing. OSC also serves as a safe and secure channel for federal
workers who wish to disclose violations of laws, gross mismanagement or waste
of funds, abuse of authority, and a specific danger to the public health and
safety. In addition, OSC enforces and provides advisory opinions regarding
the Hatch Act, and protects the rights of federal employee military veterans
and reservists under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment
Rights Act of 1994.
   Information about all of OSC’s functions, including how to file a
complaint, make a protected disclosure, or receive a Hatch Act advisory
opinion, can be located within this site. We hope that you will find our site
useful and informative, and we invite your comments and suggestions.
