   NOTES FROM THE PREZ:

   It was suggested by Frank C that we reschedule Julys meeting till Thurs
   7/12 since a lot of folks are taking off...asked John Galvin to put a
   note in the BB....

   Welcome new member Bill Brown (bldg 130 ,x7230, wsbrown2bnl.gov.) Bill
   just completed the MSF beginner class and is looking for a bike, can
   anyone help? (****** Nick & Frank C. please add him to the list) Bill
   was so pleased with the MRC class that he sent us an addtional ten
   bucks! Thanks Bill and glad to have you ,  despite what Groucho
   said......

   We've formalized plans for our 20th Anniversary Luncheon at the Gazebo
   on Wed. July 18th,at noon. We'd like to invite all past and present
   Cycletrons members as well as any BNL motorcyclists to join us for a
   free lunch (hereos, salads and soda) Frank C will be collecting a buck
   a head for a raffle/ door prizes. This is national "Work to Ride, Ride
   to Work Day", recently endorsed by the AMA to encourage use of MC's as
   daily, economical transportation. We'll be there rain or shine so mark
   the date and pass the word to fellow riders . Charles has asked BERA
   for money to cover the food. John Galvin and Mona Rowe are supporting
   the event and will have Roger take a photo for a followup article in
   the BB....

   Ride safe,

    Frank D

    We should plan a Sunday AM Greenport ride, and another after work
   ride.

   Tues evening  Cruise Nite at Bald Hill,  6-10PM

   T-shirts are in: contact Frank C. x-4220, $15 each

   ...talked to Gasper Trama , they're now charging $30 to BNL folks who
   take the beginners (MRC) class, $10 for insurance, $20 goes to MANYS
   (MC Asso. of NYS). Still a great deal. They're still in need of
   instructors. Anyone interested? It's 8 days tota,l and Gasper will be
   giving a class soon. A great weekend 'job' for someone....  http://
