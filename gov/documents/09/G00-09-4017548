   Welcome to the Microgravity Science Division Website!

   The Microgravity Science Division at NASA Glenn Research Center is
   responsible for planning, advocating, directing, and implementing space
   experiments in technology and microgravity science.

   This Division both conducts and sponsors ground-based scientific and
   technology studies that may lead to experiments in space. The focus of
   these efforts is to enhance the understanding of the role of gravity in
   a wide range of physical processes (ie. materials science, power,
   propulsion, combustion, fluid physics, plasma physics, etc.) This work
   is carried out by scientists in the external community and by
   scientists in this Division as well as in other Center organizations.
   The technology experiments for which the Division is responsible
   provide enabling technology for future space missions including the
   Space Station and the planned programs in Human Exploration and
   Development of Space Enterprise. A very significant and substantial
   part of the Division's effort is the design, buildup, testing, and
   integration of hardware for experiment packages to be launched aboard
   the Space Shuttle. This division is also responsible for planning the
   utilization of the Space Station for scientific and technological
   missions. This includes defining experimental facilities and developing
   experimental hardware for the Space Station.

     Microgravity

     Microgravity literally means a state of very weak gravity
     (one-millionth of what is felt on Earth). Conducting research in a
     microgravity environment gives scientists a unique opportunity to study
     processes which are obscured by gravity on Earth, test existing
     theories, and make new ones.

     The term 'Microgravity' will become more commonplace in the era of the
     International Space Station, the largest space structure and
     multinational space endeavor in history. The specific disciplines of
     microgravity science which will be studied aboard the space station
     include: biotechnology, combustion science, fluid physics, fundamental
     physics, and materials science.



     Acceleration Measurements

     The ISS microgravity acceleration environment consists of two regimes:
     the quasi-steady environment and the vibratory/transient environment;
     therefore, the measurement of the Microgravity acceleration environment
     is best accomplished by two accelerometer systems. In the United States
     Laboratory Module, the measurement of these two regimes is accomplished
     by the Space Acceleration Measurement System-II (SAMS-II) and the
     Microgravity Acceleration Measurement System (MAMS). The
     vibratory/transient environment, consisting of vehicle, crew, and
     equipment disturbances and covering the frequency range 0.01 to 300 Hz,
     will be measured by the SAMS-II. Due to the localized nature of these
     vibrations, this frequency range requires measurement of the
     environment near the experiment hardware of interest. SAMS-II provides
     this distributed measurement system through the use of Remote Triaxial
     Sensor systems (RTS). An individual RTS consists of an Electronics
     Enclosure (EE) and two Sensor Enclosures (SE). A SAMS-II Control Unit
     housed in an International Subrack Interface Standard (ISIS) drawer
     collects data from all active EE's and prepares the data for downlink.

     The MAMS will record the quasi-steady microgravity environment (f <
     0.01 Hz), including the influences of aerodynamic drag, vehicle
     rotation, and venting effects. The MAMS unit will be located in the
     United States Laboratory Module in a double middeck locker enclosure.
     PIMS will utilize MAMS for its ability to sense the quasi-steady
     regime. The MAMS Miniature Electrostatic Accelerometer (MESA) sensor is
     a flight spare from the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE)
     program that was used to characterize the quasi-steady acceleration
     environment of the Space Shuttle Columbia. Like the OARE data recorded
     during eleven STS missions, utilizing rigid body assumptions at these
     low frequencies will allow MAMS MESA data to be mapped to alternate
     locations within the ISS using ISS body rates and body angles data.

     Due to the dynamic nature of the microgravity environment and its
     potential to influence sensitive experiments, the Principal
     Investigator Microgravity Services project has initiated a plan through
     which the data from these instruments will be distributed to
     researchers in a timely and meaningful fashion.

     PIMS ground support equipment located at the NASA Glenn Telescience
     Support Center will be capable of generating a standard suite of
     acceleration data displays, including the various time domain and
     frequency domain options. These data displays will be updated in
     real-time and will periodically update images available via the PIMS
     International Space Station Operations page. The planned update rate is
     every two minutes. Future plans involve routing the measured ISS
     acceleration data directly to a PI's operations facilities.

     To supplement the near real-time displays, planned information
     resources will also be provided throughout the tenure of the systems on
     the ISS. General characterizations of the environment as it evolves
     will be made available on a regular basis so that investigators are
     aware of the overall environment in which their experiments were
     conducted. Accelerometer data archives and automated data analysis
     servers will allow investigators the ability to request customized data
     analysis support. Additionally, a catalog of characterized disturbance
     sources will be available in the form of an ISS MEDH.



     Fluid Physics

     A fluid is any material that flows in response to an applied force.
     Thus, both liquids and gases are fluids. Some arrangements of solids
     can also exhibit fluid-like behaviors: Granular systems, such as soil,
     can respond to extraordinary forces, like those induced by earthquakes
     or floods, with a flow-like shift in the arrangement of solid particles
     and the air pockets or liquids that fill the spaces between them.

     Fluid physicists seek to better understand the physical principles
     governing fluids, including how fluids flow under the influence of
     energy, such as heat or electricity; how particles and gas bubbles
     suspended in a fluid interact with and change the properties of the
     fluid; how fluids interact with solid boundaries; and how fluids change
     phase, either from fluid to solid or from one fluid phase to another.



     Combustion Science

     Combustion, or burning, is a rapid, self-sustaining chemical reaction
     that releases a significant amount of heat. Examples of common
     combustion processes are burning candles, forest fires, log fires, the
     burning of natural gas in home furnaces and the burning of gasoline in
     internal combustion engines. For combustion to occur, three things must
     normally be present: a fuel, an oxidizer and an ignition stimulus. An
     exception to this is hypergolic combustion, in which a fuel and an
     oxidizer spontaneously react on contact without the need for an
     ignition stimulus.

     Fuels can be solid, liquid or gas. Examples of solid fuels include
     filter paper, wood and coal. Liquid fuels include gasoline and
     kerosene. Propane and hydrogen are examples of gaseous fuels. Oxidizers
     can also be: solid, such as ammonium perchlorate, which is used in
     space shuttle booster rockets; liquid, like hydrogen peroxide; or
     gaseous, like oxygen. Air, which contains oxygen, is a particularly
     common oxidizer. An electrical spark is an example of an ignition
     stimulus.



     The FCF Combustion Integrated Rack

     Many experiments will use the Fluids & Combustion facility, complete
     with conditioned power, vibration isolation, thermal control, digital
     imaging acquisition and storage, sample illumination capabilities,
     automated cameras and positioners, and sample manipulation.

     A Capillary & Convective Flow apparatus will be used to study
     thermocapillary flows induced by local heating using a CO2 laser or a
     resistance heater allows for flow visualization, free surface
     deformation, and quantitative flow measurements using 3-D particle
     image velocimetry of chambers up to 10 centimeters in diameter.
