     Telescopes In Education (TIE) is a NASA education outreach program
      sponsored by NASA's High Performance Computing and Communications
    (HPCC) Learning Technologies Program (LTP), the NASA Office of Space
    Science (OSS), and the NASA Office of Human Resources and Education.
    TIE is also supported by JPL space exploration missions, businesses,
     and numerous volunteers. Through Telescopes In Education, students
    around the world can remotely control research-quality telescopes and
               CCD cameras from a computer in their classroom.
