                  http://rk.gsfc.nasa.gov has moved!!!!!!!


We have a new host located at http://klabs.org.   We have uploaded all of our
content; there is no content left on http://rk.gsfc.nasa.gov.

Note that for this new host the url's are case sensitive.   Additionally,
some pages have been reorganized for faster loading.  If there is any
information that you need help locating, please let me know and we will
assist you.

I personally apologize for any inconvenience or "time outs" you may have
received over the last month or so; we tried VERY hard to avoid those.

Please contact me at rich.katz@gsfc.nasa.gov if you need anything.

Regards, rk.
