    Welcome to the Greater Boston Federal Executive Board. As a regional
    hub for all government activity, the Federal Executive Board's (FEB)
                    work relates to five mission themes:

                                 Communicate
   FEBs inform member agencies of each other's initiatives and successes,
     and inform the local community of national policies and priorities.

                     Reduce Costs and Improve Efficiency
    FEBs bring together agencies with common goals so that their efforts
                              are omplementary.

                         Facilitate Service Delivery
     FEBs draw together agencies with common clients so that government
                 services are convenient for the customers.

                        Partner with Community Groups
            FEBs partner with community groups to solve problems.

                        Coordinate Emergency Services
   FEBs stand ready to marshal resources of the entire federal community,
   whether to aid a member agency in a crisis, or to assist the citizenry
                           in a public emergency."
