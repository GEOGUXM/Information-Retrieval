       ___________________________________________________________________

       ESDIS has created the External Network Prototyping Laboratory in
       order to support the mitigation of project risks and to support the
       continous evaluation and integration of evolving technologies.
       Risk management addresses ESDIS cost, schedule, and technology
       risks associated with delivering networking services within NASA
       and to external users.  Technology evaluation and insertion
       involves achieving cost savings or improved services by making use
       of new technologies.  This latter category can be considered a
       portfolio of projects with varying maturity.  Activities in this
       category range from maintaining an awareness of standards
       activities, to participating in beta-testing, to performing
       demonstrations of technologies that are mature enough for
       integration into the production environment.
