                            Welcome to the NOAA/NESDIS

        The Office of Systems Development (OSD) manages NOAA's operational
      geostationary and polar-orbiting environmental satellite programs. Our
        objective is to provide the spacecraft, launch services, and ground
      systems necessary to maintain the uninterrupted flow of remotely-sensed
           environmental data required to protect life, property and the
      environment and to promote economic well being. We are responsible for
       defining user requirements and development of conceptual engineering
         design of future satellite systems to meet those requirements. We
       cooperate closely with other NOAA offices, Federal agencies, foreign
            technical agencies, international scientific and technical
      organizations and our constituents in carrying out our responsibilities
                         on behalf of the American public.
