   This home page will offer enhanced NOAA Imagery and NOAA Imagery fused
   with other environmental data sets or modeled output.

   We ask that you credit NOAA for any DMSP, GOES or NOAA Polar Orbiting
   Satellite Imagery that you display on the air or within public or
   private presentations. The European Organization for the Exploitation
   of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) requires that you display the
   words "copyright 2001 EUMETSAT" on all METEOSAT imagery.

   The following imagery from geostationary and polar NOAA satellites is
   updated as frequently as possible. The valid time of wind data and
   forecasts superimposed on selected images does not necessarily match
   the time of the base satellite image. The times of both the processed
   image and the overlayed dataset are available in caption. For daily
   imagery not found below, use the search box to the left. Enter today's
   date, i.e. 2001.12.18, and hit return.

   We now offer a variety of visualizations and simulations that are
   produced by the Lab including Typhoon Lingling and Hurricane Michelle.
