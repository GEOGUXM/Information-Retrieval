   CAPTION:

   Forty-five States (including the District of Columbia) participate in
   the Commission, as Compact Members (21), Sovereignty Members (5),
   Associate Members (16), and Project Members (3).  To visit these and

   The Multistate Tax Commission is an organization of state governments
   that works with taxpayers to administer, equitably and efficiently, tax
   laws that apply to multistate and multinational enterprises. Created by
   an interstate compact, the Commission:
     * encourages tax practices that reduce administrative costs for
       taxpayers and States alike,
     * develops and recommends uniform laws and regulations that promote
       proper state taxation of multistate and multinational enterprises,
     * encourages business compliance with state tax laws through
       education, negotiation and enforcement, and
     * protects state fiscal authority in Congress and the courts.
