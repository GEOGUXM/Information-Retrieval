   0410uuu.gif (4028 bytes) Welcome to the ASTER spectral library, a
   compilation of almost 2000 spectra of natural and man made materials.

   The ASTER spectral library includes data from three other spectral
   libraries: the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Spectral Library the Jet
   Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Spectral Library, and the United States
   Geological Survey (USGS - Reston) Spectral Library.

   If you use data from the ASTER spectral library in a publication we ask
   that reuse of all JPL-produced materials be accompanied by the
   following statements:
