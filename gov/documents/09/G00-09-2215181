   Read our newest paper on the computational identification of
   cis-regulatory modules in Drosophila (and an accompanying commentary)
   in the January 22nd issue of PNAS, and visit the cis-Analyst website. A
   reprint is available for those without access to PNAS.

   Welcome to Michael Eisen's lab at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
   (LBNL). The lab is part of the Life Sciences Division of LBNL as well
   as the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology of the University of
   California at Berkeley. We are located in the Genome Sciences building
   (84) of LBNL, immediately adjacent to the Berkeley Botanical Gardens,
   overlooking the Berkeley campus.

   [axonarray.jpg] Our lab applies genomic approaches to study a variety
   of biological problems. We employ high-throughput experimental
   techniques that utilize DNA microarrays manufactured in our lab, and
   develop and apply quantitative analyses of DNA microarray data. Our
   current research focuses on understanding the mechanisms, logic and
   evolution of the response of yeast to changes in their environment, as
   well as the use of gene expression patterns in the classification of
   human tumors.

   This site contains information on our current research projects,
   publications from members of the lab (most in downloadable format), a
   searchable database containing public data from our lab and projects
   related to our research, software for DNA microarray analysis (free to
   academic users), and an introduction to members of the lab.
