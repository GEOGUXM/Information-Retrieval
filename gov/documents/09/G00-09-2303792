   Our Mission: To provide solutions that make the Nation's energy systems
   safe, efficient, and secure.

   The Albany Research Center is a U.S. Department of Energy materials
   research laboratory located in Albany, Oregon. We offer a broad suite
   of capabilities and expertise in Materials research. Researchers
   address fundamental mechanisms and processes; melt, cast and fabricate
   up to 1 ton of materials; completely characterize the chemical and
   physical properties of materials; and deal with the waste and
   by-products of materials processes.  During the past 55 years, the
   Center has established recognized expertise and capabilities in Wear
   and Corrosion, Melting and Casting, and in Materials Development.  Our
   researchers can provide analyses and solutions to industrial problems
   which bridge the gap between laboratory studies and "real world"
   applications.

   Some of our special facilities include:
     * State-of-the-art analytical laboratory.
     * Wear test facility.
     * Vacuum arc and induction furnaces capable of melting any metal or
       alloy.
     * Fully instrumented, 1 ton capacity, water cooled, 1-MW electric arc
       furnace with state-of-the-art air pollution control system.
     * 18-inch-diameter, fully instrumented, water-cooled, 1-ton-per-hour,
       1-MW cupola furnace with state-of-the-art air pollution control
       system.
     * Refractory processing facility.
     * Electrochemical corrosion testing facility.
     * Complete fabrication shop including a press forge, rolling mills,
       and wire drawing apparatus.
     * Trailer-mounted liquid emulsion membrane facility for extracting
       metals to purify water from discharge streams.
