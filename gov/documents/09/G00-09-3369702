   Beowulf at NASA/GSFC

      Earth and Space Sciences Project

      NASA Goddard Space Flight Center

   If you were trying to reach the central site for the Beowulf Project,
   it has moved. The site is now only available at www.beowulf.org

   The Beowulf activities at GSFC (including the maintenance
   www.beowulf.org) that were supported through the CESDIS contract
   expired with that contract.

   The Beowulf Project is alive and well. The ESS Project at GSFC remains
   a strong supporter of the Beowulf Project and the Open Source movement
   in general. The only thing that has really changed is that this URL now
   serves the Goddard specific activities.

   Beowulf Project at GSFC
          This is description of the Beowulf Project at Goddard Space
          Flight Center.

   Overview of the Beowulf Project
          This contains an introduction and overview of the Beowulf
          Project: history, goals, philosophies and observations.

   Beowulf Hardware GSFC
          This is homepage for the current Beowulf clusters that are in
          operation at GSFC along with the Goddard specific applications
          being run on those clusters.

   beowulf.org
          This is focal point for all of us involved in Beowulf projects.

   Beowulf Underground
          Unsanctioned and unfettered information on building and using
          Beowulf systems.

                          The Beowulf Project at GSFC

   The Beowulf Project began at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in
   the summer of 1994 with the assembly of a 16 node cluster developed for
   the Earth and space sciences project (ESS) by Thomas Sterling and
   Donald Becker, formerly of USRA/CESDIS. The project quickly spread to
   other NASA sites, other R&D labs and to universities around the world.
   The project's scope and the number of Beowulf installations grew at a
   fantastic rate during the late 1990's. As of mid 2000, the project
   continues to grow and it scope has expanded. The Beowulf community now
   influences almost every aspect of high performance computing and in
   many cases plays a direct leadership role.

   During the late 1990's the Beowulf activities at CESDIS and at GSFC
   where almost synonymous. Since then a number of changes have occurred:
     * Thomas Sterling has moved to Caltech. He has gained an
       international reputation in the area of high performance computing,
       not only for his work on the Beowulf Project, but also his
       leadership in the Petaflop computing community,
     * Don Becker has become CTO of Scyld Computing Corporation, a
       software development company specializing in software for Beowulf
       clusters,
     * Application development for GSFC specific application areas has
       gone "exothermic"
     * GSFC is playing a leadership role in determining how agencies can
       maximize the benefits of the Open Source Movement,
     * GSFC is building on it relationship with conventional vendors to
       incoroporate the lessons learned in the Beowulf project into
       cost-effective systems to satisfy NASA's high performance computing
       requirements.

   This web-site is a result of these changes and attempts to describe and
   record the Beowulf activities specific to GSFC.

   The beowulf.org site, which may have been thought of as the "Beowulf at
   GSFC site," is now being maintained by Scyld Corporation. The
   beowulf.org site will continue be a primary distribution site for
   Beowulf system software, will maintain the beowulf mailing lists and
   the long list of sites at are working on Beowulf activities.
