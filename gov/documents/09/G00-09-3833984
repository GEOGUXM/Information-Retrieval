   In the late 1970s, national and international attention began to focus
   on energy issues. Efforts were initiated to design and test analytical
   tools that could be used to assist energy planners in evaluating energy
   systems, particularly in developing countries.

   In 1984, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) commissioned Argonne
   National Laboratory's Decision and Information Sciences Division (DIS)
   to incorporate a set of analytical tools into a personal computer-based
   package for distribution in developing countries. The package developed
   by DIS staff, the ENergy and Power Evaluation Program (ENPEP), covers
   the range of issues that energy planners must face: economic
   development, energy demand projections, supply-and-demand balancing,
   energy system expansion, and environmental impact analysis.

   Following the original DOE-supported development effort, the
   International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), with the assistance from the
   U.S. Department of State (DOS) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE),
   provided ENPEP training, distribution, and technical support to many
   countries.

   ENPEP is now in use in over 60 countries and is an international
   standard for energy planning tools. More than 500 energy experts have
   been trained in the use of the entire ENPEP package or some of its
   modules during the international training courses organized by the IAEA
   in collaboration with Argonne's Decision and Information Sciences (DIS)
   Division and the Division of Educational Programs (DEP).
