   Senator Smith met with Hamid Karzai, the interim leader of Afghanistan.
   Senator Smith was on a nine day tour through the Central Asia region.


   I support President Bush in his efforts to provide the resources for
   our military, national defense and intelligence operations to take
   whatever action necessary to protect and defend our citizens. We will
   find those individuals who perpetrated this evil upon our nation, and
   those who may be harboring them, and respond with vigilance.

   I commend the New Hampshire soldiers, reservists and guardsmen who
   services are being called upon in defense of our country. They are the
   backbone of our nation, and their sacrifices will not go unheralded.

   "The enemy may have crushed our steel and mortar and crushed innocent
   lives but they cannot crush our spirit. We must show them that we are a
   solid, patriotic nation that unifies in crisis. We are strong enough to
   overcome this, and move forward decisively -- together."

   -Senator Bob Smith
