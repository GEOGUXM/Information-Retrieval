   Issue Spotlight

   Health-Care Reform

       In recent years, health-care costs have risen astronomically. In
   fact, national health expenditures now represent over 15 percent of our
   gross domestic product. We must ensure that Americans continue to have
   access to affordable, quality health care. I oppose the use of massive
   regulations to achieve this goal, because they would likely result in
   higher taxes, larger deficits, and higher premiums. I do not believe
   that health-care reform should become an opportunity to expand the size
   of the federal government or raise taxes on the American people.
   Instead, rising costs can be controlled using competition and free
   market principles, without reducing the quality of care currently
   provided.
   By stimulating increased consumer choice and competition, we can
   decrease health-care costs while increasing efficiency. Everyone should
   be given freedom of choice in their health insurance plans. Instead of
   accepting the insurance plan provided by an employer, consumers would
   be able to choose between different types of plans, including Medical
   Savings Accounts (MSAs), Health Maintenance Organizations, and
   traditional fee-for-service options. In the face of this open
   competition, insurance carriers and health-care providers would have
   substantial incentives to improve the quality of their products and
   rein in prices.
   MSA's also provide an excellent opportunity to increase competition in
   the marketplace. Under an MSA plan, individuals would purchase high
   deductible insurance plans and make tax deductible contributions to an
   MSA to be used for routine medical expenses. Individual consumers would
   gain a larger stake in spending decisions and enter directly into the
   health-care market. MSAs would encourage individuals to search for the
   best services available for their limited funds, causing a
   corresponding drop in prices as health-care providers begin competing
   for customers. I believe tax deductible MSAs should be available to
   everyone, thereby reducing costs adn making insurance affordable to
   more people.
   No single solution will solve all of the health-care problems in this
   country. However, each of these reforms would preserve personal choice
   adn the high quality of medical services available in the Unitede
   STates, while stemming the rising costs of care. Rest assured that I
   will keep your opinions in mind as the Senate continues to debate
   health-care reform.
