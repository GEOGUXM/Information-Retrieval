   Click on the section below that is best suited for what you're looking
   for. To the left of each page for the three sections is a toolbar that
   can be used to navigate around the site. Have fun!

   What are Beams, Anyway?

   This section of the site is designed for people who have little or no
   knowledge about the concept of beams. Photon will shed some light on
   the conceptual understanding of beams and their related properties. A
   very good introduction for people who would like to learn about
   particles, waves, energy, and their relation to beams.

   Working With Beams

   This section of the site will go into further detail about beams, and
   the related research using beams today. There is a lot of research into
   beams and their applications here at the Center for Beam Physics and
   other buildings around the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; this
   section will illustrate how it is done and what is used to do it.

   Today's Research is Tomorrow's Technology

   Tomorrow's technology is only made possible because of our scientific
   research today. This research shapes the future of our world. Join us
   in this section of the site as we explore some of the exciting new
   research going on today as we apply the terms, ideas, and physics
   discussed in What are Beams, Anyway and Working With Beams towards
   explaining this research.

   Links & Resources

   This page offers various links to sites of related interest around the
   world. These links include other Department of Energy Laboratories and
   facilities that use beams in scientific and practical applications
   today. There are also links to other sites of beam physics and related
   education, along with brief summaries of these various sites.
