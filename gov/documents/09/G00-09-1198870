   Project Description

             N[4]E conducts research on the physical aspects of information
             technology, focusing on resource flows, energy use, and
             environmental impacts associated with computing and network
             equipment. To accomplish this goal, our researchers track
             equipment sales, materials use and reuse, energy use, and
             emissions. We also estimate stocks of equipment based on
             lifetimes and survey data.

             Such information is essential for addressing questions like:

        * "What direct effect will the explosion in computing and
          communications technologies have on electricity use in the U.S.?"
        * "What are the net environmental and resource effects of
          telecommuting or web-based commerce?"
        * "How many computers exist in the U.S., how much energy do they use,
          how fast are they being replaced, and where do obsolete computers
          go once retired?"

             Our research covers all parts of the information technology
             supply chain, including manufacturing, distribution, purchasing,
             use, and final disposal of all types of computing and
             communication network systems. It also includes indirect effects
             on industrial processes and institutional structures insofar as
             these effects relate to energy use and environmental impacts.

             Research members from universities and independent research
             organizations compile data and conduct technical analysis
             related to resource flows in the information economy. They gain
             access to the network's expertise and data, in exchange for
             contributing their own.

             Research affiliates contribute data, in-kind support, and
             technical expertise, in exchange for access to the most current
             research results as they emerge.

   Ongoing Activities

             Consortium on Green Design and Manufacturing: This group
             conducts multidisciplinary research and education on
             environmental management and pollution prevention issues in
             industries such as electronics, computers, aerospace,
             automotive, and construction.

             Discussion Forum for members only. This member area allows users
             to post questions to the group and get responses from other
             members who have expertise in that area. Get more information
             about this forum.

             Resources and the Information Economy. This effort began by
             assessing claims made in an article in Forbes Magazine in May
             1999 about electricity used by the Internet, but it has grown
             into a broader effort to analyze information technology's effect
             on resource use.

             Environmental implications of telecommunications services. This
             project investigates the effects of expanded and new
             telecommunications services on the environment, exploring the
             direct environmental impacts of these services, as well as the
             indirect effects associated with telecommuting,
             teleconferencing, and other displacement of transportation and
             resource use by appropriate use of telecommunications.

             Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment. This interactive
             web tool calculates dollar, energy, and resource flows
             associated with different levels of economic activity, using
             Input-Output modeling to characterize the complex interactions
             in the US economy.

             Computer Recycling. This project tracks what happens to personal
             computers when they become obsolete. Many more are recycled than
             previously thought, while the rest are landfilled.

             The Green Design Initiative promotes environmentally conscious
             engineering, product and process design, manufacturing, and
             architecture. Researchers involved in this effort focus in part
             on Life-Cycle Assessment of electronic equipment and other
             technologies essential for the information economy.
