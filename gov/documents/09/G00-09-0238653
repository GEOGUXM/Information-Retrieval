   CAPTION:

   The Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) was
   established in 1989 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
   (LLNL) in Livermore, California. We are funded by the Environmental
   Science Division of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of
   Biological and Environmental Research (BER) as part of its Global
   Change Research Program.

   PCMDI's mission is to develop improved methods and tools for the
   diagnosis,validation, and inter-comparison of global climate models,
   and to conduct research on a variety of problems in climate modeling
   and analysis.
