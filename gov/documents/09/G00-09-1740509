   Division Overview
     __________________________________________________________________

   The goal of the Life Sciences Division is to study how the unique
   environment of space affects living systems, from cells in culture to
   physiological studies in animals and humans. Through a better
   understanding of fundamental physiology will come knowledge useful for
   both the maintenance of human health on Earth and the development of
   countermeasures to the effects of long term spaceflight.

   To meet this goal the division:
     * Conducts ground-based life sciences research
     * Implements flight experiments onboard the Shuttle, the
       International Space Station, and a variety of unmanned
       international orbiting vehicles
     * Develops the technology required to perform life sciences research
       on the ground and in space
     * Transfers technology and promotes education for the improvement of
       the quality of life on Earth
