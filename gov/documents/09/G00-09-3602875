     The Washington State Higher Education Coordinating Board (HECB) is a
     nine-member board of citizens, appointed by the governor, to
     represent the broad public interest in the development of higher
     education policy.

     The Board administers state-funded student financial aid, and
     performs some oversight and authorization functions in addition to
     its financial aid and policy duties.

     The next scheduled meeting of the HECB is set for February 6, 2002,
     at South Seattle Community College. To view or print a copy of the
     February 2002 Board Packet, please click here.
