   The Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC) is an
   independent Federal agency created to decide contests of citations or
   penalties resulting from OSHA inspections of American work places. The
   Review Commission, therefore, functions as an administrative court,
   with established procedures for conducting hearings, receiving evidence
   and rendering decisions by its Administrative Law Judges (ALJs).
