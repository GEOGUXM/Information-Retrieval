Our Sales Mission

   Regardless of which Federal agency is selling the U.S. Government
   surplus personal property or exchange/sale personal property the
   ultimate objectives of the sales program must be adhered to.  The
   objectives of the the U.S. Federal personal property sales program is
   to sell U.S. Government-owned personal property in the most expeditious
   and cost effective manner possible, to merchandise such property in
   such a manner that will result in a maximum net return to the U.S.
   Government and to perform these services economically, consistent with
   the legal requirements of the contracts resulting from the sale of such
   property.

Overview of NASA sales program

   Each year the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
   generates millions of dollars worth of surplus and exchange/sale
   personal property no longer needed by the United States Government and
   is sold to the general public.  The surplus property is sold
   competitively using sealed bid, spot bid, and auction type sales or by
   fixed price sales action for useable property.  Recyclable property
   such as used paper, newsprint, scrap metal, used tires, etc, are
   generally sold via one year term contracts using sealed bid methods.
   NASA primarily generates property for sale at its installations however
   additional smaller quantities of NASA owned property is sold from
   various contractor sites nationwide.  For example, in fiscal year 1998
   over $352 million of NASA used property (based on orginal acquisition
   cost of the property) was sold to the general public.   Additionally,
   over $111 million of recycable property (scrap or salvage condition)
   was sold.
