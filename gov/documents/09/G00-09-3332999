   Satellite laser ranging (SLR brochure and cartoon) uses lasers to
   measure ranges from ground stations to satellite borne retro-reflectors
   to the millimeter level. The primary mission of the ILRS as stated in
   the organization's Terms of Reference is "to support, through satellite
   and lunar laser tracking data and related products, geodetic and
   geophysical research activities."

   If you have a suggestion or complaint about our service, please send an
   email to the ILRS CB Secretary.
