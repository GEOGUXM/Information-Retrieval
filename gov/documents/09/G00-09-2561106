   ·         DARPA Research Opportunity - Broad Agency Announcement and
   Call for Proposals:  BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACES: The Defense Advanced
   Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is interested in new proposals in
   BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACES.   DARPA is interested in proposals aimed at
   creating new technologies for augmenting human performance though the
   ability to access neural inputs and output in real time and integrating
   neural activity and control into peripheral assist devices or
   prosthetics, robotics, or system operations.  We would like to invite
   white papers that are far reaching in their implications, innovative,
   and ambitious in their goals and implementations. For more information
   on the program and submission of proposals see the following website:
