                       Upgrade? Fermilab E835 Charmonium

   E835 is an experiment which continues the study of charmonium. The
   predecessor experiment, E760, took data during the Fermilab Fixed
   Target run on 1990-91. Since the last data taking much analysis,
   writing of papers, development of new detector subsystems, upgrades to
   exisiting subsytems and preparations for the 1996-97 Fermilab Fixed
   Target run kept the collaboration busy. Data taking began in October
   1996.

   A charm quark and an anti-charm anti-quark bound together by the strong
   force makes a charmonium meson. Different combinations of quantum
   numbers (e.g. spin and angular momentum) of the two bound constituents
   form different charmonium particle states. The study of the different
   states' masses, resonance widths and decay channels increases what is
   know about the strong force and tests many different theories
   concerning the strong interaction.
