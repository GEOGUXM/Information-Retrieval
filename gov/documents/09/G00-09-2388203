   The Information Systems Advisory Committee (ISAC) is established to
   guide the development of a co-owned and co-managed Indian health
   information infrastructure and information systems. The goal of the
   ISAC is to assure the creation of flexible and dynamic information
   systems that assist in the management and delivery of health care and
   contribute to the elevation of the health status of Indian people. The
   ISAC will assist in insuring that information systems are available,
   accessible, useful, cost effective, and user friendly for local level
   providers, while continuing to create standardized aggregate data that
   supports advocacy for Indian health programs at the national level.
