   Energy use and development is one of the primary factors forcing
   environmental change at both local and global scales.  Improvements
   need to be made in policy and project cost/benefit analysis in order to
   develop better programs  for relieving environmental pressures caused
   by the world's rapidly increasing energy demand.

   The focus of this research is to develop inexpensive yet effective
   methods for economic evaluation, energy savings forecasts, and resource
   cost estimation.  The presumption of this research is that the
   economics of energy use and development are not optimized from a long
   term perspective. Less than optimal energy markets and consumption may
   be due to either externalized costs or market distortions and
   disconnections. Externalized costs and market distortions can result in
   economic equilibria that do not maximize national or public interests.

   Investments in evaluative informational tools can aid in optimizing
   energy policy, development, and investments.   Opportunities for
   savings, development, and long term cost avoidance are not being taken
   because of lack of information, predictive ability, and analytical
   resources. The problem of information scarcity may be particularly
   acute in developing countries where the cost of highly skilled
   technical labor is 20 to 100 times the average local labor cost because
   the technical labor resources are generally imported from developed
   countries. Development of simple analytical tools that can be
   distributed freely over the Internet  may drastically decrease the cost
   of environmental and energy analysis products and allow for greater
   economic efficiency in international energy policy and resource
   development.

   Both U.S. and African  applications will be used for initial test
   studies. The U.S. has been chosen as that area where a tremendous
   amount of data and resources exist for forecasts and analyses.  Because
   of the data-rich environment, studies using U.S. case material allow
   for the detailed theoretical validation of methodologies.  Meanwhile
   Africa as that continent with the fewest information resources, and a
   rapidly growing population of over 800 million. As a continent, it has
   the greatest need for investment in inexpensive analysis methods that
   can be used with a minimum of data.  These two study areas represent
   the extremes in terms of both institutional resources and needs.
