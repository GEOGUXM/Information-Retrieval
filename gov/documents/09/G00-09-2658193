   The Center for Information Technology initiated the Software
   Distribution Project (SDP) to acquire and deliver brand-name software
   to NIH and DHHS personnel. The SDP takes advantage of large volume
   purchasing agreements to provide significantly discounted software to
   its customers. The SDP also saves its participants time and money by
   eliminating the need to search for the best software deals. For more
   information, view the SDP description.

   Please contact your agency's representative to determine your agency's
   level of participation.
