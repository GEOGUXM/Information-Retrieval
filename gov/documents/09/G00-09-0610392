   ONMS Expeditions Coordination Site

   ABOUT THIS SITE:

   Welcome, you have accessed the NOS Office of National Marine
   Sanctuaries (ONMS) Expeditions Coordination site. The purpose of this
   site is to provide planners and other staff access to information
   critical for planning, executing, and following up on ocean exploration
   projects. Currently, the site provides information on two expeditions:
   the Islands in the Stream / South Atlantic Bight expedition, scheduled
   for September 2001; and an expedition off the west coast of North
   America from Baja California to Alaska, scheduled to begin in April
   2002.

   For each expedition, the site provides users with an interactive
   Calendar, a searchable Contacts data base, a Documents library, and a
   capability to organize materials related to important Meetings and
   conference calls. To ensure the site fulfills its purpose, staff from
   the ONMS and the NOS Special Projects Office will periodically review
   the site and its contents. If you have questions pertaining to the
   expeditions, please refer to the names listed under "Key Players".
   General comments or questions about the site can be addressed to Scot
   Frew (scot.frew@noaa.gov).

   Most documents will be posted in Adobe Acrobat's PDF format which can
   be viewed with the free Adobe Acrobat Reader.
