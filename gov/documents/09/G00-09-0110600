   Space and Remote
   Sensing Sciences
   (NIS-2)

      Paul G. Weber
      Group Leader

      Peter LaDelfe
      Deputy Group Leader

      The NIS-2 mission is to develop and apply remote sensing
      instrumentation to problems of national security and related basic
      science. Applications include nonproliferation, detection of nuclear
      explosions, climate studies, and environmental measurements, all
      coupled with strong contributions to the sciences.

      NIS-2 has a state-of-the-art optical and infrared calibration facility.
      We have several high-voltage pulsed x-ray sources, experimental vacuum
      chambers, several well-equipped instrumentation laboratories, and
      extensive computational equipment. Our major customers are the DOE,
      National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Department of
      Defense (DoD), and other government agencies. We collaborate with
      universities, industry, and other research organizations.
