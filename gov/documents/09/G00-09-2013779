The Consortium for Advanced Radiation Sources

   The Consortium for Advanced Radiation Sources (CARS) is a
   multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary consortium managed by the
   University of Chicago Center for Advanced Radiation Sources. CARS is
   comprised of:

   Five institutional members:
     * The University of Chicago
     * Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO) on
       behalf of the Australian Synchrotron Research Program.
     * Northern Illinois University
     * Southern Illinois University at Carbondale
     * University of Illinois at Chicago

   And four national groupings of scientists served by three sectors at
   the APS:
     * Geophysical and geochemical sciences (Sector 13 GSECARS)
     * Soil and environmental sciences (Sector 13 GSECARS)
     * Structural biology (Sector 14 BioCARS)
     * Chemical and materials sciences (Sector 15 ChemMatCARS)

   CARS has constructed and operates the experimental facilities at the
   Advanced Photon Source (APS) as National Synchrotron Resources
   available to the scientific community as National Facilities. Beamtime
   is allocated through peer review of beamtime proposals to the
   facilities.
