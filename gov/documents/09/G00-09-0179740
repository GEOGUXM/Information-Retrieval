                 Welcome to the NASA Wallops Flight Facility

                          GEOSAT Follow-On Web Site

    Use the global links on the left side of the page to browse about the
                              WFF GFO web site.

   Overview

     The Navy's Geosat Follow-On (GFO) Mission, launched on February 10,
     1998, is one of a series of altimetric satellites which include
     Seasat, Geosat, ERS-1, and TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P). Data derived from
     these missions has and will lead to vast improvements in our
     knowledge of ocean circulation, ice sheet topography, and climate
     change. In order to capture the maximum amount of information from
     the altimetric data, accurate altimeter calibrations are required
     for the civilian data set which NOAA will produce. NASA/Goddard
     Space Flight Center/Wallops Flight Facility (GSFC/WFF) has provided
     these products for the Geosat and T/P missions and will do the same
     for GFO.
