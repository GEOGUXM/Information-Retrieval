   PUMAS Title
   PUMAS logo PUMAS (poo' · mas) -- is a collection of one-page examples
   of how math and science topics taught in K-12 classes can be used in
   interesting settings, including everyday life. The examples are written
   primarily by scientists and engineers, and are available to teachers,
   students, and other interested parties via the PUMAS Web Site. Our goal
   is to capture, for the benefit of pre-college education, the flavor of
   the vast experience that working scientists have with interesting and
   practical uses of math and science...
