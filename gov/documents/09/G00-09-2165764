                              The CGRO Mission
                                (1991 - 2000)

   The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory was the second of NASA's Great
   Observatories. Compton, at 17 tons, was the heaviest astrophysical
   payload ever flown at the time of its launch on April 5, 1991 aboard
   the space shuttle Atlantis. Compton was safely deorbited and re-entered
   the Earth's atmosphere on June 4, 2000.
   Compton had four instruments that covered an unprecedented six decades
   of the electromagnetic spectrum, from 30 keV to 30 GeV. In order of
   increasing spectral energy coverage, these instruments were the Burst
   And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), the Oriented Scintillation
   Spectrometer Experiment (OSSE), the Imaging Compton Telescope
   (COMPTEL), and the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET).
   For each of the instruments, an improvement in sensitivity of better
   than a factor of ten was realized over previous missions.
   The Observatory was named in honor of Dr. Arthur Holly Compton, who won
   the Nobel prize in physics for work on scattering of high-energy
   photons by electrons - a process which is central to the gamma-ray
   detection techniques of all four instruments.
