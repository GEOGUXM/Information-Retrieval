   CALIFORNIA FOR THE DOE

   Los Alamos National Laboratory maintains one of the University of
   California's five branches of its Institute of Geophysics and Planetary
   Physics. We sponsor a broad, collaborative research program in the
   Geosciences that provides for exchanges of university faculty and
   students with laboratory research staff. This collaboration results in
   a continuous flow of ideas to and from the Laboratory that invigorates
   and enhances Laboratory program and core competency development
   efforts, as well as continuing collaboration with the University of
   California and other research universities throughout the nation.
