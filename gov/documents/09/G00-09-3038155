   Energy Information Sources

   Welcome to the Energy Technology Data Exchange (ETDE), a program of the
   International Energy Agency (IEA). We are proud to present ETDE World
   Energy Base or ETDEWEB, our new tool for disseminating the energy
   research and technology information that we collect and exchange.
   Through access to this and our traditional product, ETDE's Energy
   Database, ETDE members create the following benefits for their
   countries:
     * keeping researchers informed about the latest research developments
     * providing scientific and technical information from countries
       around the world in all areas of energy
     * providing a directory for full-text government reports and
       conference literature
     * identifying energy subject-area experts
     * promoting international cooperation in energy research and
       development

   Only ETDE members have access to the scientific and technical
   information found in ETDE products. In addition to the energy research
   and technology information from ETDE member countries, the database
   contains citations published worldwide regarding nuclear, coal, and
   global climate change information. This broader coverage comes as a
   result of cooperation with other international organizations. The full
   database also contains the U.S. Department of Energy's information from
   1974 forward.
