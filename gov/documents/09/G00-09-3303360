   [ISMAP:BigBlip2.gif] The Cassini Radar is one of eighteen science
   instruments that will fly on board NASA's Cassini spacecraft to study
   the planet Saturn, its rings, and its moons. The specific task of the
   Radar instrument will be to study Saturn's largest moon, Titan.

   This web site contains primarily information related to the Radar
   instrument. For in-depth information on the Cassini mission, its
   objectives, the Cassini spacecraft, and the other science instruments,
   you are invited to view the Cassini Project Homepage.

   The structure of this web site follows "The Quest" to fly the Cassini
   Radar. You will be led from the birth of the Cassini Project to Radar
   mission operations. We want you to understand that even a project of
   the magnitude of Cassini merely follows a sequence of events that are
   set in motion and carried out through the creativity and commitment of
   regular people. You will even meet some of those people here.

   To provide you with some background, we have included a section
   entitled "Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Radar," in which we
   present information on the development of radar, the basic physics of
   radar, and what radar instruments can do. We conclude this section by
   describing some of the other radar missions currently flying or in
   development by NASA.

   In addition, we have included a section entitled "The Big Picture," in
   which we outline the history of the Cassini Project and briefly
   describe the spacecraft, its engineering subsystems, and the science
   instruments. Once again, for more information on all of these topics,
   you can consult the Cassini Project Homepage.

   Within the "Education" section, you will find information on the
   soon-to-be-released Cassini Radar CD-ROM. We also plan to have an
   exciting educational activity relating to the Cassini Radar within this
   section very soon. Keep an eye out for it!

   You can access the pages in this site randomly by simply selecting the
   Site Index icon or TAB, which you will find on every page. On each page
   of the Quest you will also find a timeline graphic that tells you where
   you are with respect to the development of the Radar.
