                      Interactive Universe (iUniverse)
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Interactive Universe project is an education initiative to aid in
   the understanding of the planets, solar system, galaxy, and universe
   beyond. 3D models representing the Earth-Moon system, Solar System,
   Nearby Stars, Milky Way Galaxy, Local Galaxies, and the known Universe
   are being created using the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML).
   Some of the preliminary models are available below. New models,
   tutorials, and documentation will be added as they are available.

Earth - Moon

   How far is the Moon from the Earth? 239,000 miles. How far is that? If
   you line up 31 Earths end-to-end then you can cover the distance to the
   Moon. The first model below shows the Earth and Moon in their relative
   sizes and distances from each, while the second model illustrates 31
   Earths lined up and also includes the Moon next to two moon-sizes
   objects all inside of the last "Earth" to show the relative size of
   Moon with respect to the Earth.

    VRML models

     * Model for SGIs and/or high-end graphics machines:
          + VRML 1.0 model (40,000 stars) (compressed 298K)
     * Model for PCs (Win95, Mac, etc):
          + VRML 1.0 model (4,000 stars) (compressed 30K)
          + VRML 1.0 model w/you are here arrow

Local Galaxies

   Local Galaxies
     * VRML model (55 galaxies) (Requires VRML 2.0 browser)

Universe

   Universe
     * VRML 1.0 model (2,367 galaxies out to a distance of 50,000 kPc)
     * VRML 2.0 model (2,367 galaxies out to a distance of 50,000 kPc)

   Both local galaxy and Universe models have an expanding
   semi-transparent sphere surrounding the position of the Milky Way
   galaxy which is at the origin (0,0,0). As you go away from the Milky
   Way galaxy the color and size of this expanding sphere represents the
   distance (purple = 1,000 kPc; blue = 10,000 kPc; red = 100,000 kPc).
   The radius of the spheres are 1/10th the distance; e.g., the red sphere
   has a radius of 10,000 kPc and it appears if you are beyond 100,000 kPc
   from the Milky Way. This navigation technique allows you to always know
   where you are in relation to home and how far out.
