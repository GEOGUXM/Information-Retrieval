  Herzberg belongs to Foss Friedman-Hill of the Distributed Systems Research
  Department at Sandia National Laboratories. Its namesake, Gerhard Herzberg,
  was a famous small-molecule spectroscopist, which is what Foss did in a former
  life. Now Foss studies (among other things) computing with Distributed
  Objects, and applications for "Intelligent Agents" in scientific computing and
  in manufacturing.
