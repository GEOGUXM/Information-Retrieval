                 -- A NOAA Strategic Goal --

   Many coastal areas and resources are experiencing environmental
   decline. The reasons for coastal environmental decline are numerous and
     complex, but population growth and the cumulative effects of human
         activities affecting coastal areas are significant factors.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Over 50% of the U.S. population lives on only 10% of the land area that
   is coastal, and these populations are growing at a faster rate than
   those inland.

   This increased population translates into a loss of coastal habitats
   such as wetlands and riparian areas. These habitats are essential to
   over 75% of the total commercial landings and 80-90% of the
   recreational catch of fish and shellfish of the continental U.S. fish
   species dependent on coastal habitats have been reduced to historically
   low levels by over-fishing, habitat loss, and habitat deterioration
   from pollution and alterations in freshwater flows. These biological
   problems threaten significant sectors of the U.S. economy. For example,
   commercial fisheries produce $3 billion in revenue to fishermen and
   generate $38 billion in economic activity nationally. Seventeen million
   Americans who enjoy recreational fishing, generate an estimated $18
   billion in economic activity.

                            Clean Coastal Waters

   The water quality of our coastal areas is in decline.

   There have been disruptive changes in the biological composition and
   structure of coastal ecosystems that raise serious concerns. These
   changes in biological diversity can be an indicator of stress on
   coastal ecosystems. In other coastal areas, good environmental
   conditions are threatened by point and nonpoint sources of pollution.
   Thirty-five percent of estuarine waters assessed in the U.S. are
   impaired and 10% are threatened. Runoff from diffuse sources like city
   streets, farms, suburban lawns, and forest clear cuts contribute
   significantly to the problem. Coastal recreation and tourism are a
   significant sector of the U.S. economy and depend on good environmental
   conditions such as clean coastal water for swimming and fishing. In
   Monroe County, Florida alone, which includes the Florida Keys,
   saltwater fishing and tourism generate nearly half a billion dollars
   annually. In 1994, foreign visitors to the U.S. spent $78 billion
   largely in coastal locations.

   Intensive residential and commercial development of coastal areas,
   particularly fragile, storm-prone areas such as barrier islands, puts
   life and property at risk and creates substantial financial
   liabilities.

   Coastal storms such as hurricanes annually cause billions of dollars of
   damage. For example, damages from Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina in
   September 1989 totalled $10 billion. Some damages from coastal storms
   could be avoided by making better decisions about placement of
   development in coastal areas. Older urban waterfronts are in decline in
   many cities, and thoughtful planning and the revitalization of these
   areas is essential for their future economic viability.
