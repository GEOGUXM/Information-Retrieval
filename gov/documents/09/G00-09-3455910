   Welcome to the home page for the Sport Fishing Club at the Goddard
   Space Flight Center. The charter of the Fishing Club is to promote
   fishing activities for employees and their families at GSFC. We support
   fishing at the Goddard Pond, and fishing charters in the Chesapeake
   Bay. Meetings, and workshops & tournaments information is also
   available.

What's New? - December 20th, 2002

   The Sport Fishing Club is beginning to plan activities for calendar
   2002. As many of you know, my participation and involvement in Club
   functions during the second half of this year were non-existant as
   Work-Related responsibilities had to take priority. I was actually
   over-committed with work, and after the Kids Fishing Derbies in the
   Spring, I had to focus on the completion of two back-to-back Hitchhiker
   Shuttle flight missions (HEAT aboard STS-105, and MACH-1 aboard
   STS-108). Our other Club Staff also had similar work/personal
   committments, and we just had to a brief time-off from the Club. We
   apologize for this.
   With the successful completion of the Hitchhiker missions, I am fully
   prepared to manage my responsibilities in a more balanced fashion in
   the future. We plan to have a full activities plan for 2002. First, we
   will update the website by February 4th, 2002 with our suggested
   activities for the year. Secondly, we will be searching for a charter
   boat captain, one which could never replace Captain Dave, but,
   nevertheless we need find a reasonable captain that likes to chum.
   Thirdly, we hope to offer more fishing derbies and tournaments at the
   Goddard Pond as that resource may "not be available" in the future, if
   the Goddard Master Road Plan is incorporated. In the meantime, please
   let me know of any ideas, and if you wish to help this year...

   Note: Volunteers are always needed to help sponsor these activities.
   Anyone interested is volunteering some of their time to help make these
   events possible please let me know. Thanks so much.
