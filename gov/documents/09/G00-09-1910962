   CAPTION:

   Since its inception in 1958, NASA has accomplished many great
   scientific and technological feats in air and space. NASA technology
   also has been adapted for many non-aerospace uses by the private
   sector. NASA remains a leading force in scientific research and in
   stimulating public interest in aerospace exploration, as well as
   science and technology in general. Perhaps more importantly, our
   exploration of space has taught us to view the Earth, ourselves, and
   the universe in a new way. While the tremendous technical and
   scientific accomplishments of NASA demonstrate vividly that humans can
   achieve previously inconceivable feats, we also are humbled by the
   realization that Earth is just a tiny "blue marble" in the cosmos.
