   Statistics



   The Indian Health Service (IHS) has been functioning within the
   American Health System since 1955. Native Americans, including those in
   Alaska, who depend on the Indian Health Service for health care, number
   close to one million. Reservations in Montana, the Blackfeet, Crow,
   Northern Cheyenne, Fort Peck, Fort Belknap, Rocky Boys, and Flathead,
   plus the one Wyoming Indian reservation, the Wind River, are all served
   by the Billings Area IHS. Montana and Wyoming with their wide-open
   spaces, rural atmosphere, and western history, are lasting homes for
   the ancestral lines of the Native Americans. For thousands of years,
   they followed the bison and other game, where farmers, gathered the
   fruits of the land, and struggled with other tribes for hunting rights.
   Finally, as the bison disappeared and the white man continued to push
   farther and farther west, the Native Americans were settled onto
   parcels of land, marking the end of an era. Today they live a modern
   existence on the reservations, yet cling to customs of times gone by.

   The seven Indian reservations in Montana and the one reservation in
   Wyoming, consist of a people who are attempting to meld two worlds into
   one as best they can. They continue to teach their heritage and culture
   to their young, and most of them still speak their native languages in
   the home. Yet most of the tribes are progressive and forward-looking
   regarding the needs of the people economically, mentally and medically.

   Public Law 93-638, the Indian Self-Determination and Education
   Assistance Act, was developed to help the Native Americans take charge
   of various programs to be able to control their own destinies. Among
   other things, the law created provisions that make present health care
   operations a combination of direct Indian Health Service management and
   tribal management, some of the tribes are moving forward to manage
   their programs more quickly than others.

   There is a team effort between the Indian Health Service and the tribe.
   The IHS provides support needed for the health professional and the
   tribe, to provide the best possible health services.
