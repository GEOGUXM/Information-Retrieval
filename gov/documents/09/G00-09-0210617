   The AIRSAR Mission

[dc8_in_flight.jpg]

   A Flying Laboratory    AIRSAR instrument (panels behind wing) mounted
   aboard a modified NASA DC-8 aircraft.  During data collection, the
   plane flies at 8 kilometers over the average terrain height at a
   velocity of 215 meters per second.

   The Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) is an all-weather
   imaging tool able to penetrate through clouds and collect data at
   night.  The longer wavelengths can also penetrate into the forest
   canopy and in extremely dry areas, through  thin sand cover and dry
   snow pack.  AIRSAR was designed and built by the Jet Propulsion
   Laboratory (JPL) which also manages the AIRSAR project.   AIRSAR serves
   as a NASA radar technology testbed for demonstrating new radar
   technology and acquiring data for the development of radar processing
   techniques and applications.  As part of NASAs Earth Science
   Enterprise, AIRSAR first flew in 1988 and continues to conduct at least
   one flight campaign each year, either in the United States or on an
   international mission.
