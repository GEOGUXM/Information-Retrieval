Overview

   The Human Radiation Experiments Information Management System was
   originally commissioned by the Department of Energy. It was designed by
   Argonne National Laboratory to allow users to search for imaged
   historical radiation documents that have gone through the OCR (Optical
   Character Recognition) process. The Department of Energy desired to
   create a simple, accessible collection of historical records on
   radiation experiment research. HREX currently contains over 250,000
   pages of historical documents from the following agencies: Department
   of Defense (DoD), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Health and
   Human Services (HHS), Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA), and Central
   Intelligence Agency (CIA). HREX users can customize their search using
   the Advanced Features to find the records they need.

   The creation of this database began in 1993 with a system of locating
   and identifying the records of human radiation experiments conducted by
   the different agencies. The documents are related to experiments
   conducted at both government and non-government facilities, beginning
   in the 1940s. HREX affords users the ability to see the historical
   context in which these experiments took place. The agencies contribute
   valuable information to this ongoing effort . This initiative is close
   to completion. However, case research will continue until all cases are
   thoroughly addressed.
