   About the Commission
   A growing number of Americans are using alternative approaches to
   health promotion and medical treatment. People are looking to health
   care providers to treat the whole person, not only illness. Because of
   public interest in and use of unconventional health care, the President
   established the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative
   Medicine Policy. Executive Order 13147 authorizing the Commission was
   issued on March 7, 2000.

   The Commission, which is composed of individuals knowledgeable in both
   conventional and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), has been
   charged with addressing:

     [gold_bullet.gif]   Research on CAM practices and products

     [gold_bullet.gif]   Dissemination of reliable information on CAM to
                         health care providers and the general public
     [gold_bullet.gif]   Appropriate licensing, education, and training of
                         CAM health care practioners

   The Commission's recommendations on public policy and legislation are
   due to the President through the Secretary of Health and Human Services
   in March 2002.
