   The Question

      The oceans play a vital role in global climate. Due to their immense
      capacity to store heat and carbon, the oceans act to moderate climate.
      The oceans absorb heat at equatorial latitudes and transport heat
      poleward. While the oceans are moderating climate, the oceans also may
      be affected and altered by changes in climate. As global temperatures
      rise, increased freshwater runoff to the oceans may alter the salinity
      and density structure of the ocean, changing the ocean's density
      circulation. Furthermore, ocean biology has an as-yet unquantified
      effect on atmospheric chemistry. To what degree do the oceans influence
      climate? Will a changing global climate ultimately change the oceans?
      How do changes in ocean circulation, ocean biology, and air-sea
      exchange affect society? Are human activities affecting ocean
      processes?

   The Response

      Understanding interactions between ocean, atmosphere, land and
      biosphere is the primary objective of the Moderate Resolution Imaging
      Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite. The unique
      vantage point of space allows synoptic views of the Earth, aiding in
      understanding the Earth as a whole interrelated system. Specifically,
      MODIS will provide images of daylight-reflected solar radiation and
      day/night thermal emissions over the entire globe nearly every day,
      using a wide spectral range and moderate spatial resolution (250m -
      1km).

   The Process

      Some of the 36 different wavelengths that MODIS samples have never
      before been measured from space. New ocean and atmosphere data
      products, that have not been derived on a global scale before, will be
      available for research to the scientific community. The three
      categories of MODIS ocean products are ocean color, sea surface
      temperature, and ocean primary production. Improved atmospheric
      products will enable better correction for atmospheric effects in the
      ocean signals. The products will be used to investigate ocean
      circulation, ocean biology, and ocean chemistry, including the ocean
      carbon cycle.

      In addition to ocean measurements, simultaneous measurements of
      atmosphere, land and ice, such as land vegetation, cloud
      characteristics, temperature profiles, moisture profiles, snow cover,
      and sea ice, will allow scientists to interrelate the processes driving
      global climate. The data will subsequently be used in computer models
      to gain a better understanding of these complex systems and how they
      interact. With this information, scientists will improve their ability
      to detect human impacts on the Earth system, and to predict significant
      changes in Earth's environment.
