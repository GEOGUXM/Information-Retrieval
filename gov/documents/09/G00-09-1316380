   The Air Resources Laboratory (ARL), conducts research on processes that
   relate to air quality and climate, concentrating on the transport,
   dispersion, transformation, and removal of trace gases and aerosols,
   their climatic and ecological influences, and exchange between the
   atmosphere and biological and non-biological surfaces. The time frame
   of interest ranges from minutes and hours to that of the global
   climate. Research in all of these areas involves physical and numerical
   studies, leading to the development of air quality simulation models.
   ARL provides scientific and technical advice to elements of NOAA and
   other Government agencies on atmospheric science, environmental
   problems, emergency assistance, and climate change. For more
   information about ARL see our Strategic Plan and our History Document.

   ARL has research units in the following locations:
     * Headquarters Division - Silver Spring, MD
     * Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Division - Oak Ridge, TN
     * Atmospheric Sciences Modeling Division - Research Triangle Park, NC
     * Field Research Division - Idaho Falls, ID
     * Special Operations and Research Division - Las Vegas, NV
     * Surface Radiation Research Branch - Boulder, CO
