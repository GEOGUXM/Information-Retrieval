     "To witness a total eclipse of the Sun is a privilege that comes to
     but few people. Once seen, however, it is a phenomenon never to be
     forgotten. The black body of the Moon standing out ... in sinister
     relief between Sun and Earth, the sudden outflashing glory and radiance
     of the pearly corona which can be seen at no other time, the scarlet
     prominences rising from the surface of the hidden Sun to heights of
     many thousand miles, the unaccustomed presence of the brighter stars
     and planets in the daytime, the darkness of twilight and the unusual
     chill in the air. There is something in it all that affects even the
     strongest nerves and it is almost with a sigh of relief that we hail
     the return of the friendly Sun."
