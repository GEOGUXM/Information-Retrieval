   [globul1a.gif] Two new features are added to this program:

    1. If you provide data in the adjustment field(s), a memo note will be
       generated after confirmation requesting you to provide an
       explanation of up to 250 characters.
    2. There is a "Auto Calculate" button next to the "Total intrastate
       billings subject to surcharge".   If you click on it after you
       provide the billings amount and applicable adjustments, the program
       will automatically calculate the total amount due including
       interest/penalty due to late filing.   These data are not final
       until confirmed.

   For the current and historical approved surcharge rates, click here.
