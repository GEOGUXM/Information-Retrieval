                           The Digital Cinema 2001
                             Conference and Show
                          "A New Vision for Movies"

     The Digital Cinema 2001 Conference and Show brings the National
     Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) expertise in
     measurements and standards to bear in identifying challenges in
     assuring quality and interoperability in Digital Cinema. By its
     location, the Conference brings Digital Cinema to the attention of the
     East Coast post-production and imaging communities.

                                 Digital Cinema

     Digital Cinema (D-Cinema) is a medium in which several feature movies
     have been released, such as Fantasia 2000 and Toy Story 2, it has been
     a topic of several Conferences over the last year, and it has been the
     subject of a Study Group organized in the Society of Motion Picture and
     Television Engineers (SMPTE) in the same period. The SMPTE D-Cinema
     Study Group is to issue its report in November, 2000, just in time for
     the D-Cinema Conference 2001. The Conference is distinguished by an
     emphasis on measurements for interoperability.

                                   Objectives

       * Articulate a vision for digital cinema
       * Identify technological and business issue barriers to achieving
         that vision
       * Develop strategies for breaching the barriers, including needed
         standards, technology development, and research

                               Who should attend?

     The NIST D-Cinema Conference provides an introduction to D-Cinema aimed
   at decision makers and end users from:
     * Post-production and production
     * Mapping and motion imagery
     * Theater Owners
     * Technology providers in software, storage, and display
     * Others with an interest in the development of measurements and
       standards for digital cinema and very high quality motion imagery
