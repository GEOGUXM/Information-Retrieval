   GOA II: Special and Unique Features
     * Ultra-high accuracy and low-cost routine automated processing
     * Models - complete, comprehensive, can be s/c tailored

     * State-of-the-art force modeling: Earth/Sun/Moon/planets (and tidal)
       gravity perturbations, solar pressure, thermal radiation, drag,
       empirical models etc.
     * Geometric: Earth orientation, tides, ocean/atmosphere loading,
       general relativity, crustal plate motion, GPS yaw model, phase
       windup etc.

     Filter/smoother estimator
     * Intelligently identifies, corrects or excludes questionable data
     * Automated, efficient, fast operation: uses matrix factorization for
       rock-solid stability
     * Sophisticated and flexible process noise modeling
     * General estimator used for GPS and non-GPS satellite data

     Caltech has filed for patents with the U.S. Patent Office
