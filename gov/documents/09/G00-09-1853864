   Meeting Geometry and Grid Generation needs for Engineering Analysis

      The Geometry Laboratory (GEOLAB) of the NASA Langley Research Center
      provides expert assitance in the construction and analysis of computer
      based geometry used in numerical engineering analysis.  The lab offers
      production and consultation services in an open-shop environment.  Our
      expertise is focused in the areas of Computer Aided Design (CAD) and
      numerical grid generation.  The staff members of the GEOLAB are
      proficient in the operation of various commercial CAD packages and with
      both multi-block structured and unstructured grid generation
      techniques.  Services are offered using state-of-the-art hardware and
      software.  We support researchers in a variety of fields including
      Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Computational Structural Mechanics
   (CSM), Computational Electro Magnetics (CEM), and Biomedical research.

   Current events in the GEOLAB: The GEOLAB is currently under the normal
   production schedule with hours of operation covering 6:00am -6:00pm EST
   M-F.
