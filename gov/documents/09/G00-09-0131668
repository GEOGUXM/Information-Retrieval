[world.gif] Who We Are

   [bluebar.gif]

   The Aeronomy Laboratory (AL) is one of the twelve Laboratories in the
   Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) of the National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Laboratories of OAR
   are located in several states, from the East Coast to the West Coast.
   The research areas of the individual Laboratories focus on particular
   aspects of the Earth system and on different research approaches, with
   the common broad aim of improving the understanding and prediction of
   geophysical phenomena that relate to the well-being of humankind.

[world.gif] Our Mission

   [bluebar.gif]

   The ultimate aim of the Aeronomy Lab's research is:

         to improve the capability to observe, understand, predict,
                 and protect the quality of the atmosphere.

   The Aeronomy Laboratory conducts fundamental research on the chemical
   and physical processes of the Earth's atmosphere. This research
   concentrates on the lower two layers of the atmosphere, known as the
   troposphere and stratosphere (see figure below).

   Both the stratosphere and the troposphere have important direct and
   indirect effects on the well-being of humankind. In this century, it
   has become increasingly clear that humans are influencing the chemical
   composition of the troposphere and stratosphere in ways that can impact
   conditions at the Earth's surface. Some of the most challenging
   environmental issues of our time have arisen. At the Aeronomy Lab, over
   120 scientists, engineers, students, and supporting staff are engaged
   in studies of these issues, working with colleagues from other
   institutions across the United States and around the world.

             The Regions of the Atmosphere is described below...

   The Regions of the Atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere has layers, which
   are actually characterized by how the temperature of the atmosphere
   changes with altitude. The troposphere begins at the Earth's surface,
   which acts as a source of heat resulting from absorption of visible
   sunlight. The temperature decreases with height in the troposphere, and
   so the air is well mixed in this region (Greek: tropos, a turning).
   Weather phenomena such as thunderstorms and clouds occur in this layer,
   as does most of the commercial airline traffic at present (exceptions
   include the higher-flying supersonic aircraft, for example, the
   Concorde). Near about 9-12 kilometers (16-17 kilometers in the tropics)
   a new region called the stratosphere begins. The stratosphere is heated
   from above (absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation by oxygen and
   ozone) and temperature increases with altitude. In this region there is
   much slower mixing (Latin: stratum, layer). The "ozone layer" resides
   in the stratosphere. At about 50 kilometers (30 miles), temperature
   begins to decrease with altitude again and the mesosphere begins.

   As you explore the Aeronomy Laboratory Home Page, you will undoubtedly
   expect to find much information about our scientific work. We will meet
   that expectation, but tell you more that perhaps will surprise you...
   because an important part of our work entails a step beyond "doing the
   science." And that step is communicating our findings to those who need
   the information. Our customers are many and varied, including the
   general public, government officials, industry leaders, and, of course,
   our scientific colleagues around the world. Below is the story of our
   scientific research, its relationship to issues of importance to
   society, and our work to communicate our findings to our customers.
   Let's begin...
