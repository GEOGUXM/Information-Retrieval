      Chandra takes in bright lights, big city of Milky Way
      NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has made a stunning, high-energy
      panorama of the central regions of our Milky Way galaxy. The findings
      are an important step toward understanding the most active area of the
   Milky Way as well as other galaxies throughout the universe. The
   Marshall Center manages the Chandra program.

      Chandra finds ghosts of eruption in galaxy cluster
      NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has uncovered "ghostly" relics of an
      ancient eruption that tore through a cluster of galaxies. The discovery
      implies that galaxy clusters are the sites of enormously energetic and
      recurring explosions, and may provide an explanation why galaxy
      clusters behave like giant cosmic magnets. The Marshall Center manages
      the Chandra program.
