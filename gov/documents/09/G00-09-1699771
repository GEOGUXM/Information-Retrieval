   The Service Contract Act Wage Determination Database (SCA) contains
   unsigned copies of the latest wage determinations developed by the U.S.
   Department of Labor (USDOL). These wage determinations, issued by the
   Wage and Hour Division in response to specific notices filed, set the
   minimum wage on federally funded service contracts. The SCA is updated
   each Tuesday with all wage determinations that were added or revised by
   the preceding Thursday.

   For those federal agencies participating under the Memorandum Of
   Understanding (MOU) with the USDOL's Wage and Hour Division, and
   meeting all MOU requirements, the SCA may be used in the procurement
   process. For all other users, the wage determinations contained herein
   are for INFORMATION USE ONLY. They are not considered official wage
   determinations for specific solicitations or contracts and should NOT
   be incorporated therein. They are not to be used to set prevailing wage
   rates on federal service contracts. Official wage determinations must
   be obtained in accordance with Regulations 29 CFR, Section 4.4.
   However, this information does provide an excellent source for those
   interested in an advanced approximation of what minimum rates may be
   specified by the Wage and Hour Division in response to duly filed
   notices. This data also forms a convenient and accurate basis upon
   which rates may be compared by occupation and geography.

   If you are interested in the SCA, you may want to also visit the Davis
   Bacon Act Online also.
