     What is TMF?
     Table Mountain Facility (TMF) is a unique, remote scientific and
     engineering facility that produces innovative results. TMF is a Jet
     Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) asset and is classified as a Remote
     Site. Our facility provides an ideal location for many research
     projects, including Astronomy, LIDAR, and projects for universities
     and colleges.


     Where is TMF located?
     TMF is located near the town of Wrightwood, CA, in the Angeles
     National Forest operating on a memorandum of understanding with the
     United States Forest Service, approximately 1.5 hours drive from the
     main JPL lab in Pasadena.

     When is TMF open?

     TMF is operational 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Inclement
     weather and road conditions do sometimes dictate when it is safe for
     science customers to travel to and from the facility.

     Can anyone do experiments or projects at TMF?
     No. If a project that is not NASA funded or part of the Jet
     Propulsion Laboratory is interested in doing research at TMF they
     must have special permission granted from NASA to use a NASA
     facility. This is accomplished by first having a JPL sponsor submit
     a memo identifying: who, what, when, where, and why to the Contracts
     Management Office for NASA approval. If NASA grants their approval a
     Facilities Use Request is issued by JPL.

     How many people work there?
     TMF employs a full time operations staff, including two full time
     JPL employees, one Academic Part Time (APT), and six contractor
     personnel. The various full time science projects on site such as
     LIDAR, ACRIMSAT, FTUVS, Astronomy, etc. employ approximately 12 full
     time JPL employees and a varying number of part time employees.
     Other science projects have personnel coming and going as they
     perform their research.

     Why does JPL have a facility in the mountains?
     The innovative results of many of our projects are possible due to
     TMF's remote location, altitude, climate, and lack of light
     contamination in the dark sky. TMF is historicaly one of the best
     places in the U.S. for cloudless night time skys, essential for
     astronomy and atmospheric remote sensing.

     Do you give tours?
     Tours are uncommon at TMF because it is a working research and
     development center. TMF does not have a visitor's center to provide
     this service, and since the scientists are the only ones cognizant
     of their instruments and experiments, special arrangements with
     scientists must be made in advance for special situations.

     How is TMF funded?
     The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a Federally Funded Research and
     Development Center (FFRDC). It is funded by the National Aeronautics
     and Space Administration (NASA) and managed by the California
     Institute of Technology (Caltech).

     The Table Mountain Facility (TMF) is a JPL asset and is classified
     as a Remote Site. It is operated for the Chief Scientist by the
     Earth and Space Sciences Division (Div 32). Approximately 80%
     funding for TMF is provided by the Technical Infrastructure
     Committee (TIC); when working on direct projects or tasks, personnel
     charge to those projects.

     The remaining 20% is funded by the remote site user fees from
     projects working at TMF and using office or building space for 60
     days or more, and by the dormitory fees that are charged for
     overnight science customers using the dormitory.
