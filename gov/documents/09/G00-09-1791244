                     Mathematical Modeling and Analysis
     ___________________________________________________________________

   The Mathematical Modeling and Analysis group combines the strengths of
     applied mathematics, mathematical physics and numerical analysis to
      derive, analyze and solve applied mathematical models of complex
       problems. Our mission is to conduct forefront basic and applied
       research in mathematical modeling analysis, provide theoretical
       leadership and support for the Laboratory and other programs of
    national interest and to furnish an effective interface with academic
                                  science.

          Artificial Viscosity for Multidimensional Hydrodynamics:

     Special methods are required to allow a hydrodynamics algorithm to
     model shock waves, otherwise the simulation will develop unphysical
    oscillations in the shocked flow. A common method for correcting this
      is the addition of an artificial viscosity. We developed a tensor
    viscosity which displays little dependence on the computational mesh.
          The figure shows results for the cylindrical Noh problem.
