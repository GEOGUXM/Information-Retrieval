               Space Station scientists expand colloid research

        Ground-based scientists expanded their colloid research aboard the
      International Space Station during the past week from study of the fine
      particles in colloids to gel structures built with these particles. The
         gel structure allows scientists to study basic properties such as
       formation and aging that may be useful in ground-based manufacturing.
      Space Station science experiments and payload operations are managed by
                 the Payload Operations Center at Marshall Center.
