   ACCESS MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER

   Access management is the process that provides access to land
   development while simultaneously preserving the flow of traffic on the
   surrounding road system in terms of safety, capacity, and speed. The
   basic principles of access management include:

                   LIMITING THE NUMBER OF CONFLICT POINTS

   At intersections along roadways a variety of vehicle paths will cross,
   merge into or diverge from one another. Anyplace this happens a
   conflict point exists. Conflict points are good indicators of the
   potential for accidents. The more conflict points that occur at an
   intersection the higher the potential for vehicular crashes. A typical
   4-leg intersection has 32 conflict points, however, when left turns and
   cross street through movements are restricted , the number of conflict
   points drops to 4. Thus the potential for crashes is significantly
   reduced.

                       SEPARATING BASIC CONFLICT AREAS

   Intersections of public streets as well as intersections of public
   streets and driveways represent basic conflict areas. High levels of
   activity can occur at these locations and, consequently, through
   traffic needs time to react to the decelerations, accelerations and
   travel paths of other vehicles at or near the intersections. Adequate
   spacing between intersections allows drivers to react to one
   intersection at a time and provides greater opportunities to avoid
   potential conflicts at each successive downstream intersection.

                 REDUCING INTERFERENCE WITH THROUGH TRAFFIC

   Traffic often needs to slow down for vehicles exiting, entering, or
   turning across the roadway. Providing turning lanes and restricting
   turning movements allows turning traffic to get out of the way of
   following through traffic.

             PROVIDING ADEQUATE ON-SITE CIRCULATION AND STORAGE

   The design of good internal vehicle circulation in parking areas and on
   local streets reduces the number of driveways that businesses need for
   access to the major roadway. Our office has created a number of
   products to help regulate access and educate the public on the benefits
   of access management.
