   Feature Stories
       Annual deformation surveys completed for Kilauea and Mauna Loa
   volcanoes, Hawai`i
   Portion of a map showing horizontal displacements of GPS bench marks,
   Hawai`i Scientists of the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory recently
   completed several different types of surveys of Kilauea and Mauna Loa
   volcanoes in order to track vertical and horizontal movements of the
   top and sides of both volcanoes. The summit of Kilauea continues to
   subside and the south flank continues to spread seaward. The summit of
   Mauna Loa moved very little in the past year. Details.

   Report: Deployment plan for studying diverse magmatic systems along the
   Western North America plate boundary

   This document is an outgrowth of the Second Plate Boundary Observatory
   (PBO) Workshop held in Palm Springs, California, on October 30 -
   November 1, 2000. It represents a consensus of the PBO Magmatic Systems
   Working Group and was reviewed by the Non-San Andreas Proposal Review
   Panel. The plan is preliminary and subject to change in response to
   various factors, including volcanic activity, funding decisions,
   logistical considerations, and the ongoing planning process for PBO and
   EarthScope. Report.

   The Quaternary and Pliocene Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field of
   Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana

          This detailed report (USGS Professional Paper 729-G)
          reconstructs the volcanic history of the Yellowstone Plateau
          region. The geologic history of the plateau includes three
          eruptive cycles that resulted in the eruption of voluminous
          rhyolite pyroclastic flows (among the largest on Earth) and the
          formation of large calderas about 2.1, 1.3, and 600,000 years
          ago. The study mainly involves geologic mapping and the
          delineation of volcanic stratigraphy and significant structural
          relations.

   Volcanism in National Parks: Summary of the Workshop Convened by the
   U.S. Geological Survey and National Park Service, 26-29 September 2000,
   Redding, California

          In recognition of the importance of volcanism to diverse park
          issues, the Geologic Resources Division of the National Park
          Service and the Volcano Hazards Program of the USGS convened a
          workshop in September 2000 to bring together USGS and NPS
          scientists, managers, and interpreters. The purpose of the
          gathering was to lay the groundwork for improving scientific
          input to park management (operations, resource management,
          interpretation, and planning) and for facilitating volcano
          research and hazard monitoring in parks. This report (USGS
          Open-File Report 01-435) summarizes key aspects of the workshop.
