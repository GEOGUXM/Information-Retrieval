                       National Labor Relations Board

                                    rule

   The NLRB is an independent Federal agency created in 1935 to enforce
   the National Labor Relations Act. We conduct secret-ballot elections to
   determine whether employees want union representation and we
   investigate and remedy unfair labor practices by employers and unions.
   To find out more about your rights under the Act (as well as other
   labor laws) and how to file a charge or election petition, start by
   clicking the Help Desk button. If you have a job-related question or
   problem that appears to be within our jurisdiction, please contact the
   local NLRB office nearest you.

           filings. List of Board offices and their phone numbers.
