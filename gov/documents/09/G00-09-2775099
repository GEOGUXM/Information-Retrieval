     __________________________________________________________________

   HCUPnet is based on aggregate statistics tables to speed up data
   transfer and protect individual records, so not all possible queries
   can be addressed. If a query is not possible, HCUPnet will not allow
   you to choose certain parameters. If there is a query you'd like to see
   that HCUPnet does not support, please write us at hcup@ahrq.gov.
