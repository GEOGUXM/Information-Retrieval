                                  Overview

       The CIA has established this site to provide the public with an
    overview of access to CIA information, including electronic access to
   previously released documents. Because of CIA's need to comply with the
   national security laws of the United States, some documents or parts of
     documents cannot be released to the public. In particular, the CIA,
      like other U.S. intelligence agencies, has the responsibility to
    protect intelligence sources and methods from disclosure. However, a
    substantial amount of CIA information has been and/or can be released
   following review. See "Your Rights" for further details on the various
                   methods of obtaining this information.
