   Mission Statement

   Welcome to the Intramural Animal Care and Use (ACU) program of the
   National Institutes of Health (NIH). This page is intended to serve as
   an information resource for NIH scientists, Animal Care and Use
   Committee (ACUC) members, veterinarians, animal science specialists,
   and other NIH staff involved in the conduct of biomedical research here
   at NIH.

   Dr. Michael M. Gottesman, Deputy Director for Intramural Research
   serves as the Institutional Official for the NIH Intramural Research
   Program. Twenty-one of the 30 NIH components use animals in their
   intramural research programs. Each of those 21 components have an ACUC,
   and their program is directed by a senior veterinarian, the Animal
   Program Director (APD). In the conduct of their research, the
   scientific staff, ACUCs and APDs are responsible to the Institutional
   Official. The Animal Research Advisory Committee (ARAC) meets monthly
   to discuss trans-NIH topics and to provide advice to the Institutional
   Official. The Office of Animal Care and Use (OACU) provides oversight
   and programmatic assistance on behalf of the Institutional Official.

   Components of the intramural NIH ACU are accredited by the Association
   for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care
   International.
