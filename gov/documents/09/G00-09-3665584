Overview

   The Space Environments and Technology Archive System (SETAS) has been
   established to preserve and provide easy access to the diverse
   collection of space environments and technology (SET) resources. The
   resources are organized according to technical disciplines and data
   sources.
   The technical disciplines are meant to encompass the varied aspects of
   the space environment and their effects. These include ionizing
   radiation, meteoroids and debris, neutral external contamination,
   plasmas and fields, thermal and solar, electromagnetic effects,
   materials and processes, and systems.
   The data sources refer to space missions and experiments, including the
   Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), Hubble Space Telescope (HST),
   the European Retrievable Carrier (EuReCa), and Clementine / Deep Space
   Probe Science Experiment (DSPSE). It is planned that this list will be
   expanded to include all available data sources.
   Resources are planned to include:
     * SET data, analysis, documentation, photographs and publications
       from in-space and terrestrial laboratory experiments
     * Simplified models of the space environment and effects - for use in
       conceptual and preliminary design studies to identify
       environment-related concerns and design options
     * Descriptions of high fidelity models of space environments and
       effects - for use in final spacecraft design and operational
       phases. Contacts responsible for execution and analysis of the
       models are to be included as well.
     * Guidelines for spacecraft design
     * Space flight hardware and ground test specimens that have value to
       future SET-related investigations
     * SET research test facilities and descriptions
     * SET technology development programs, current and planned
