                       Remote Access to CDC Computers
     __________________________________________________________________

   If you just need a dumb terminal (for example, to read your email with
   pine), use

     an ssh terminal session within the browser window.
   If you need to do X11 graphics work, you can

     Start a VNC X-window session in your browser.
   Tips for VNC:
   1) To speed things up, set the desktop background to a solid color (the
   default CDE background is an image which is slow to load).
   2) To get a middle button click in the Windows client, click the left
   and right buttons simulatenously. In the Mac Viewer, Cmd-2 produces a
   middle click and Cmd-3 produces a right click.
   3) More info on VNC here.

  Remember to log out of your vnc session, and close the ssh applet window when
  you are done!
