What is the Kepler Mission?

     It is a special purpose space mission in the NASA Headquarters
     Discovery Program for detecting terrestrial planets, that is, rocky
     and Earth-size around other stars.

How can extrasolar terrestrial planets be detected?

     Planet orbiting star When a planet passes in front of its parent
     star, as seen by us, it blocks a small fraction of the light from
     that star. If the dimming is truly caused by a planet, then the
     transits must be repeatable. Measuring three transits all with a
     consistent period, duration and change in brightness provides a
     rigorous method for discovering and confirming planets - planets
     even smaller than the Earth.

     From the brightness change the planet size can be calculated. From
     the period the orbital size can be calculated and the planet's
     temperature estimated.

                             Kepler was selected
              as one of the two new Discovery missions ! ! ! !

Status:

     Kepler was selected on Dec 21, 2001 as one of the next two Discovery
     missions ! ! ! !
     See the NASA Ames press release and the NASA Headquarters press
     release.

     On July 20, 2001 NASA HQ received our Concept Study Report (Step 2
     proposal) for the the next new Discovery Mission. Two competing
     proposals (Dawn and Inside Jupiter) were also due by July 24.

     On Mar 22, 2001 a kick-off meeting was held at NASA HQ for the three
     candidate missions to begin their 4 month studies leading to a
     down-selection of one mission for flight.

     On Jan 4, 2001 the Kepler Mission was selected as one of three
     candidate missions for the next Discovery mission. Final selection
     for flight will be done towards the end of 2001. See the attached
     NASA HQ Announcement. Further details are contained in the NASA Ames
     Press Release

     We have updated this web site to reflect what has been proposed to
     NASA.

     We received funding in 1999 to perform a technology demonstration.
     This is described in several new papers on the Technical Papers page
     and in several new web pages Technology Demonstration.
