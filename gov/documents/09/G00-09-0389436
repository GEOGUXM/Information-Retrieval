   SFPORTS - Navigation aids for SF Bay

Welcome to the USGS RESEARCH SITE FOR SFPORTS

   real time observations are provided by NOS/NOAA PORTS InfoHub
                          ________________________

   SFPORTS was created through a partnership of the National Ocean
   Service, NOAA, the U.S. Geological Survey, the California Office of Oil
   Spill Prevention and Response, and the Marine Exchange of San Francisco
   Bay.

   The objective of this page is to demonstrate techniques for the
   delivery of value-added information to the real-time oceanographic
   observations collected by NOS/NOAA (InfoHub ). The real-time data are
   displayed in graphical form to show historical changes in these data
   for the past 24 hours, and to forecast the tidal process for the next
   24 hours. The real-time data are assimilated in a marine nowcast
   numerical model whose results, along with recent field observations,
   are delivered to the maritime community. This interactive near
   real-time information is made available to improve navigation safety,
   provide hydro-meteorological information for spill prevention and
   cleanup, navigation schedule and planning, search and rescue missions,
   and for recreation.
                          ________________________
