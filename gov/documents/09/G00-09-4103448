                           Core Financial Project

   On September 20, 2000, NASA selected SAP Public Sector and Education,
   Inc. of Washington, D.C., to deliver a commercial off-the-shelf
   accounting system to replace the ten different systems now used by NASA
   field centers.

   A team of NASA employees from across the Agency skilled in accounting,
   procurement and information technology has been brought together at
   Marshall Space Flight Center to implement the pilot program, and to
   support the implementation at other NASA locations.
