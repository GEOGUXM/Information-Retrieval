   Purpose of the Conservancy

   integrated program of resources stewardship so that the Baldwin Hills
   area is managed for its optimum recreational and natural resource
   values based upon the needs and desires of the surrounding community.

   The Conservancy was created by Senate Bill 1625 and was chaptered on
   February 22, 2000.   A map of the area covered is available in PDF
   format.
