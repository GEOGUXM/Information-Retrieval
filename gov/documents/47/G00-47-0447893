     * ATM ABR Service Traffic Management Conformance Test Tool:
       This software kit is intended to provide a tool for ATM product
       developers and ATM test equipment designers who need to construct
       test facilities for standard conformance testing of ABR service
       rate control implementations. The protocol that is the target of
       this effort is provided in the Available Bit Rate (ABR) rate
       control scheme specified in section 5.10 of the ATM Forum Traffic
       Management (TM) Specification V4.0. This implementation tool
       provides the user with an environment for executing all of the
       conformance test cases proposed by NIST to the ATM Forum for ABR
       rate control (ATM Forum/97-0034).

     * ATM Network Routing Protocol (PNNI) Performance Simulator:
       The PNNI Simulatorallows researchers and network operators to
       simulate the operations of the ATM network routing protocol in
       order to predict the performance of a given network topology, to
       compare the performance of various configurations, and to study the
       scalability of the ATM Forum PNNI protocol. Several performance
       measurement metrics are provided.

     * ATM/HFC Simulator:
       The provides a means for researchers and network planners to
       analyze the behavior of ATM networks and/or HFC networks without
       the expense of building a real network. The simulator is intended
       to be a planning tool for network operators and a protocol analysis
       tool for researchers. For ATM networks, the simulator implements
       the AAL, ATM, and physical layers; for Hybrid Fiber-Coax networks,
       the simulator implements IEEE802.14 and Society of Cable TV
       Engineering (SCTE) Cable TV modem protocols. The simulator includes
       simulated applications using TCP/IP or native ATM interfaces, and
       it contains a rich set of traffic models, including self-similar
       traffic and MPEG-2 compressed video streams.

     * ATM PNNI Protocol Interoperability Test Tool:
       The PNNI IOP tool was developed to assist software developers, test
       equipment vendors, and network administrators to implement or
       perform tests for the ATM network routing protocol or ATM Forum
       PNNI Specification V.1, based on the ATM Forum's Interoperability
       Test Suite for PNNI.

     * IPsec-WIT:
       IPsec-WIT is an interoperability test system built around the
       Cerberus IPsec prototype and commonly available WWW technology.
       IPsec-WIT allows implementers and system integrators to remotely
       control and execute series of interoperability tests with the
       Cerberus reference implementation. Test case selection,
       configuration, execution and results analysis are all controlled
       remotely using a WWW browser. This novel use of WWW technology to
       control the test system allows IPsec-WIT to provide remote
       interoperability testing services anytime and anywhere without
       requiring any distribution of test system software, relocation of
       the systems under test, or coordination of access to the reference
       implementation or tester.

     * ISPI:
       ISPI is an interactive, integrated tool for measuring the
       performance of quality of service (QoS) sensitive data streams
       while conducting experiments with emerging Internet resource
       reservation protocols and real-time network services. ISPI is
       capable of supporting stream selection based upon session directory
       protocols (i.e., SD, SDR), monitoring the performance of data
       streams that use the Real Time Transport Protocol (RTP) and
       allowing proxy interaction with routers supporting the Resource
       Reservation Protocol (RSVP).

     * NIST Net:
       The NIST Network Emulation Tool NIST Net is a general-purpose tool
       for emulating performance dynamics in IP networks. The tool is
       designed to allow controlled, reproducible experiments with network
       performance sensitive and adaptive applications (e.g., voice over
       IP) and control protocols in a simple laboratory setting. By
       operating at the IP level, NIST Net can emulate the critical
       end-to-end performance characteristics imposed by various wide area
       network situations (e.g., congestion loss) or by various underlying
       subnetwork technologies (e.g., asymmetric bandwidth situations
       involving xDSL and cable modems).

     * LibcapV6:
       LibcapV6 is a extension to the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) to
       support IPv6. LibcapV6 allows tools such as tcpdump and sniffit to
       support testing of IPv6 in a fully general way. Initial release
       planned in Q299.

     * AGNI:
       AGNI is a framework and toolkit for the design and development of
       scripted, reconfigurable distributed systems. AGNI, based upon an
       abstraction called Mobile Streams, provides the basis for
       developing destributed systems based upon TCL agents. Initial
       release planned in Q299.

     * NIST Linux ATM Multicast:
       NIST LAM is a prototype implementation of IP multicast over ATM for
       Linux. The prototype provides a Multicast Address Resolution Server
       (MARS) daemon and MARS client functionality that is integrated in
       the Linux kernel. Initial release planned in Q299.

     * NIST Cerberus IPsec Reference Prototype:
       Cerberus is a leading edge prototype and reference implementation
       of emerging network layer Internet security (i.e., IPsec)
       technologies. Implemented as a kernel module for the Linux
       operating system, the Cerberus prototype provides complete support
       for IPsec authentication and encryption services in both tunnel
       (i.e., firewall) and transport (i.e., host) mode.

     * NIST Switch:
       NIST Switch is a rapid prototype platform for research in
       Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), and QoS routing.  The NIST
       Switch platform implements MPLS forwarding and extensions to the
       Resrouce Reservation Protocol (RSVP) to support label distribution
       functions.  Intitial release planned in Q299.

     * SMIL Player:
       The NIST SMIL player is a publicly available reference software
       tool that implements the SMIL 1.0 standard. The NIST SMIL player is
       a Java applet implementation of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)'s
       Synchronized Multimedia Integrated Language (SMIL) Recommendation.
       The player allows Java-enabled browsers to synchronize, temporally
       and spatially, the presentation of Web multimedia objects, such as
       audio, video, image, and text, so as to create richer TV-like
       multimedia content. The player is based on open standard
       technologies such as industry defined Java Media Framework (JMF)
       and the Document Object Model (DOM) of W3C.
