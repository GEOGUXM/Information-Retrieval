   USER NOTES

   ^* To provide the science community with a wider dynamic range of IR
   calibration from the GOES Imagers, we are converting from the
   192-to-320K linear calibration curve to the 163-to-330K dog-leg
   calibration curve known as "mode A". This change in IR calibration
   happened for the GOES-EAST 8-bit images as of 4 pm EDT 18 July 2001,
   and it will happen for the GOES-WEST 8-bit images a few days after
   that.
   In addition, old URLs through "goese" and "gosf" were changed and
   simplied to "goeseast" and "goeswest".

   To avoid a security hole in FTP, directory names were shortened to no
   more than 8 characters in April 2001. This will affect old bookmarks
   and automated scripts. Please report broken links.
