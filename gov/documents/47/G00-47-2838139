           ******************************************************

   During the months of June, July and August the Fermilab Theory Group
   runs an active Summer Visitors Program. The ideal applicant for this
   program is a theoretical physicist with a Ph.D. who wishes to spend two
   to four weeks at Fermilab and who is involved in an active research
   program that is related to the current particle physics research being
   performed at Fermilab.

    For the successful applicants Fermilab will provide suitable on-site
   housing plus a modest per diem. No travel expenses will be provided.

     Sorry, we can not consider any more applications for this year's
   program, all available slots have been filled. Please visit us in 2002!

Visa requirements:

     All foreign visitors (except green card holders) please bring your
   passport so that we can make a copy of the passport as well as the I94
   arrival card.
     In addition,
     * We ask that visitors from abroad get B-1 visas or the WB visa waver
       so that we can pay for their housing and per diems.
     * J1 and H1 visa holders need to bring a letter from their home
       institution authorizing Fermilab to pay for the housing and per
       diems.
     * F1 visa holders need to bring a letter from their home institution
       authorizing Fermilab to pay for the housing and per diems. The
       letter also needs to state that their visit constitutes an
       intrinsic part of their study program. In addition we either need
       an EAD or else the back of your I20 needs to state that you are
       approved for curricular practical training.



Laptops at Fermilab:

   Please feel encouraged to bring your laptop with you. Fermilab offices
   have ethernet outlets. Therefore you only need to bring an ethernet
   card (and driver plus cable). We're using DHCP. In addition the
   building is equipped for wireless ethernet (protocol 802.11).

   Fermilab visitor info including maps and driving directions.
