      We're Looking for Stories
      Federal procurement reform is one of the most outstanding success
      stories of reinventing government. No longer mired down by red tape and
      senseless restrictions, government is moving toward buying computer
      products and systems like they do in the private sector. By buying a
      little, testing a little, and fixing a little, agencies get timely
      delivery of continually improved products at considerable savings.

      Access America E-Gov E-Zine is looking for stories that tell how
      federal agencies, or multi-agency partnerships, are bringing about this
      reform, and what it means to agencies that buy and workers who use the
      systems.

      These stories can be short, as in a "byte" of about 150 words, or they
      can be longer feature stories. Write feature stories in plain language
      with quotes from procurement officials, vendors, program
      administrators, and federal workers who use the products to get their
      jobs done.

      Include a contact person with phone number and email address. Send your
      stories to pat.wood@npr.gov or pat.smith@gsa.gov. If you need more
      information, call Pat Wood, National Partnership for Reinventing
      Government, (202) 694-0063. Please pass this request along to others
      who may be interested.
