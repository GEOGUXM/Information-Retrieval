   Events / Special Programs
   Spark your students imagination through special events and
   competitions.
   JASON Project JASON is a unique collaboration that utilizes
   telepresence technology to enable grade 3-9 classrooms to join in on
   and interact with ongoing research missions of the JASON team. Before
   implementing curriculum in the classroom and bringing students to Ames
   for the exciting broadcast and hands-on activities in the Spring,
   teachers must attend a one-day training in the Fall. Contact: Tom
   Clausen (650) 604-5544.
   NASA Student Involvement Program (NSIP) is a nationwide competition
   that encourages high school students to participate in NASA research
   topics. Students compete in the areas of engineering, computation,
   journalism and art. The winner of the supercomputer division receives a
   week-long internship at Ames to conduct research at the Numerical
   Aerodynamic Simulation Facility. Contact: Tom Clausen (650) 604-5544.

   National Engineers Week is a week during which NASA engineers and
   scientists visit Bay Area classrooms to focus on career opportunities
   in engineering. Contact: Thomas B. Clausen (650) 604-5544.
   Robotics Education Program (REP) is your NASA source for K-12 robotics
   education. REP organizes several robotic competitions, including the
   two described below, and will be offering online robotics courses and
   labs for credit in the future. Contact Joe Hering (650) 604-2008.

   Robotics FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and
   Technology) hosts high school students from fourteen Western States who
   design robots for this annual regional competition while gaining an
   inside look at the engineering profession. Students team up with
   engineers from businesses and universities for six weeks to brainstorm,
   design, construct and test their champion robot.
   Botball Program involves high school students, under the guidance of
   their teachers, and with consultation from members of the supporting
   organizations, in creating a mobile robot over four weeks to compete in
   a regional Botball tournament. Teachers and members of supporting
   organizations are involved in a three-day tutorial to learn robotic
   technology and integration into regular math and science curriculum
   prior to building the robots.
