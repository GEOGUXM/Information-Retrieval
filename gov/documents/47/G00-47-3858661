             Countywide Transportation Plan Updates and Meetings
   _______________________________________________________________________

     The Countywide Transportation Plan describes the vision for meeting
   future transportation needs, including specific projects, programs and
   policies needed to provide a balanced transportation system in Alameda
   County. This long-range policy document looks at future population and
   employment patterns and is used to guide funding and service decisions
    over the next 25 years, addressing freeways, buses, rail, ferries and
     other options such as telecom, bicycling and pedestrian facilities.
    Transportation projects competing for state or federal funds must be
   consistent with this plan, as well as with the Regional Transportation
                    Plan currently being updated by MTC.

     The Alameda County Congestion Management Agency is responsible for
   developing and updating the Alameda Countywide Transportation Plan. The
     ACCMA Board includes representatives from Alameda County, fourteen
                        cities, AC Transit and BART.

   The Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) lays out how federal, state and
    regional transportation funds expected to flow to the Bay Area during
     the next 25 years will be spent to maintain, manage and improve the
    regions system of roadways, public transit, and bicycle/ pedestrian
                                 facilities.

    Every three years, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC),
   the transportation planning, coordinating and financing agency for the
        nine- county Bay Area, is required to update the current RTP.

     Listed below are workshops and meetings MTC will hold over the next
       eight months throughout the Bay Area to inform residents of the
      transportation options and decisions that lie ahead and to obtain
            comments on what should be included in the 2001 RTP.

   Individual meeting flyers are available for download in .pdf format, as
                           they become available.

   _______________________________________________________________________

    This document-Transportation Vision 2018 and Beyond, prepared by the
       Alameda County Congestion Management Agency (CMA)-is the CMA's
   long-range countywide transportation plan. It sets out the CMA's vision
    for meeting future transportation needs, including the Agency's goals
       for Alameda County's transportation system, its investment and
     management policies, and the specific projects needed to provide a
      balanced transportation system through the year 2018 and beyond.
   This plan is complemented by the CMA's other major policy document, the
          Congestion Management Program, which presents short-range
                            transportation plans.
