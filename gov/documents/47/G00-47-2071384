                               ? WHAT'S NEW ?
     __________________________________________________________________

                     During April-September, 2001, NOAA
                              and the U.S. Navy
                    Will Conduct Five Expeditions to the
                     Monitor National Marine Sanctuary.

                           throughout the season.

                         In the Summer of 2000, NOAA
                     Conducted Three Expeditions to the
                      Monitor National Marine Sanctuary

   The goals for Monitor 2000 were:
     * install concrete bags in the stern to shore up and stabilize the
       hull and
     * begin the process of recovering the Monitor's unique Ericsson steam
       engine.
                               _______________

   Monitor 2000 consisted of three phases:

          April 26 - May 13: NOAA site preparation dive expedition

         June 17 - July 30: Navy stabilization and recovery mission

        July 17 - August 11: NOAA post-mission survey dive expedition
                               _______________

                 You can read about the Expeditions on-line

                       at the Monitor Center Web Site.

   Background:

   NOAA has determined that the collapse of the Monitor's hull could occur
   at any time and that the result would be the loss of much of the ship's
   structure and many of its historic contents. As a result, NOAA
   developed a long range preservation plan for the Monitor that calls for
   stabilization of the hull and recovery of some of the ship's most
   important components.

   In 1998 the Monitor's three-ton iron propeller was recovered by Mobile
   Diving and Salvage Unit Two.

   In 1999, a team of Navy divers from USS Grasp and MDSU TWO surveyed the
   Monitor's stern and machinery spaces and assessed the potential for
   shoring up the hull with grout bags and recovering the engine, guns and
   turret. These two Navy missions were partly funded by NOAA.

                         Monitor Propeller Recovery

                         Subject of NOVA documentary

                         on PBS on October 24, 2000

   NOVA, the award-winning Public Broadcasting System science program,
   opened its fall programming with a documentary entitled, "Lincoln's
   Secret Weapon." This one-hour program follows a team of U.S. Navy
   divers and NOAA scientists who recover the propeller from the Monitor
   in the first phase of a multi-year effort to recover and preserve key
   elements of this famous Civil War ironclad.

                           History Channel Special

        The History Channel is still repeating their two-hour special
                      documentary, "Raise the Monitor."

   The documentary covers the Monitor's brief career including her
   construction and launching in January 1862, her sinking in December of
   that year, and subsequent efforts by NOAA and the U.S. Navy to save
   parts of the Monitor. Watch your local tv listings for repeats of this
   exciting show.

   August 1999 Expedition Goals

   The 1999 Monitor Research Expedition, the second of two 1999 site
   visits, is focussing on survey and assessment of the lower hull and
   engineering space to facilitate plans for shoring of the hull and
   recovery of the engine in the year 2000. The goals include:
     * Document, through drawings, measurements, and photography the hull,
       stem to stern, from directly overhead and from the port and
       starboard sides; the stern; the turret; the lower hull and
       machinery spaces; and the areas beneath the hull to be impacted by
       shoring activities.
     * Map and recover exposed artifacts beneath the hull that may be
       damaged by planned shoring activitie.
     * Excavate inside and at the base of the turret and map the excavated
       areas.
     * Inspect permanent mapping datums, replace as necessary, and measure
       between datums.
     * Document on film and video, to the extent possible, both surface
       and subsurface expedition operations and activities.
     * Obtain video and still images, with scales, of the entire midships
       bulkhead cross-section, photographed from forward, looking aft.

   August 1999 Expedition Participants

   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
   The Marine Sanctuaries division (MSD) of NOAA is responsible for the
   overall planning and coordination of the archaeological and engineering
   aspects of the mission, as well as for coordinating funding,
   interagency cooperation and all other aspects. The Mission Chief
   Scientist will direct NOAA aspects of the mission, possibly with
   assistance from other NOAA archaeologists and research personnel. A
   NOAA representative will be on site at all times to provide Mission
   oversight and to help ensure that the Operations Manual goals are met
   and that the Monitor's hull and contents are not adversely affected.

   NOAA Diving Center
   The NOAA Diving Center is responsible for establishing training and
   operational parameters, approving the dive procedures portion of the
   operations plan, approving the NOAA divers who are to participate,
   approving the non-NOAA divers who are to participate under a
   reciprocity agreement, providing essential equipment and personnel and
   overseeing the on-site dive operations.

   National Undersea Research Center/University of North
   Carolina-Wilmington
   The National Undersea Research Center/University of North Carolina at
   Wilmington (NURC/UNC-W) is responsible for the operation of the
   recompression chamber and for gas mixing and filling, NURC/UNC-W is
   also providing a research vessel and captain, as well as personnel and
   equipment to support the diving operation.

   The Cambrian Foundation
   The Cambrian Foundation, a private not-for-profit research
   organization, is responsible for dive training and on-site dive
   supervision. The Cambrian Foundation will also provide trained,
   experienced divers and specialized equipment for on-site dives.

   The Mariners' Museum
   The Mariners' Museum, Newport News, Virginia, is the principal museum
   for the artifacts and archives from the Monitor. The Museum is
   responsible for the conservation and curation of all recovered cultural
   material. The Museum will also participate in the documentation,
   education, and public affairs aspects of the Mission.
