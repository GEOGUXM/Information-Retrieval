SOHO EIT light leaks, 1998 February 4

   It appears that the SOHO was struck by a micrometeorite shower in the
   early morning hours (UT) of 1998 February 4. As a result, all four EIT
   sectors now show light leaks,apprently the result of pinholes in the
   front filters. (Formerly, only Fe XV 294 Å and, to a lesser extent, Fe
   IX, X 171 Å showed light leaks.)

  Thermal response

   There is no indication that any mechanism overheated during the 03:05 -
   03:25 UT period in which the LASCO electronics box (the LEB) stopped
   taking images.

                           [EIT temperatures plot]

   From this, it appears that the LEB behavior, as well as the appearance
   of new light leaks in EIT, are due to external sources, e.g., a
   micrometeorite impact.

So where do we go from here?

   EIT is equipped with an internal filter wheel that allows us to insert,
   for example, an additional thin Al filter to counteract exactly this
   sort of failure. This will require exposures 2 - 3 times as long as our
   current exposures (wavelength dependent). The greatest challenge will
   be flat-fielding the new, dual grid, so for some months, our images
   will show a (new) grid pattern.

Quicklook Analysis - Still ongoing...

   It is obviously important to understand the calibration between the
   Clear and Al+1 filter. Comparisons have been made (both pre- and post-
   launch) to obtain the filter ratios. As a double check we obtained a
   sequence of Clear and Al+1 exposures (full field, full resolution and
   2x2x binned) in each of the 4 bands. The images were taken on Feb. 4,
   1998 between 15:40 and 17:00 UT.
   A quick comparison of their histograms can be viewed at:
   Raw 171 Clear and. Al +1
   Raw 195 Clear and. Al +1
   Raw 284 Clear and. Al +1
   Raw 304 Clear and. Al +1
   Prep 171 Clear and. Al +1
   Prep 195 Clear and. Al +1
   Prep 284 Clear and. Al +1
   Prep 304 Clear and. Al +1
   The relevant parameters are:

   Wave Filter Exp. time Median Bgrd/off limb? Median DN/on limb? DN/sec
   Pre-flight Ratio Al+1/Clear
   171 Clear 5.6 45 170 31
   171 Al +1 7.1 25 105 15 0.49
   195 Clear 9.1 40 120 13
   195 Al +1 12.1 25 70 6 0.49
   284 Clear 62.1 25 25 <1
   284 Al +1 152.1 15 15 <1 0.33
   304 Clear 25.1 35 240 9
   304 Al +1 52.1 15 140 3 0.29

   What does this tell us? This table addresses 3 issues, stray light,
   filter ratios, exposure times. First, examining the background levels
   we see that the stray light has been reduced with the Al +1 filter.
   This is also very apparent in the images. Second we have verified the
   filter ratios (factor of 2 for 171, 195 and ~3 for 284,304) are indeed
   correct.
   The answer in terms of exposure times is a little more difficult. If
   one were looking to obtain the same absolute DN level with the Al+1
   filter as the Clear then we need to increase our exopsure times. This
   is not a problem with 171 and 195 but it begins to get long for 304 and
   especialy 284. HOWEVER, if one cares about obtaining the same level of
   signal to noise, then the above exposure times already achieve this.
