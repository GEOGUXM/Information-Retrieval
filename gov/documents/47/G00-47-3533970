     * January 28, 2002 -- The NIST draft publication of the System
       Administration Guidance for Windows 2000 Professional is now
       available for public comment. The document is intended to assist
       the users and system administrators of Windows 2000 Professional
       systems in configuring their hosts by providing configuration
       templates and security checklists. The document introduces secure
       configuration recommendations for setting up some popular Windows
       applications, such as Symantec Norton AntiVirus, Network Associates
       McAfee, and F-Secure Anti-Virus virus scanners, Microsoft IE and
       Netscape Communicator web browsers, Microsoft Outlook and Eudora
       e-mail clients, and Microsoft Office 2000 Professional productivity
       software. Comments and questions are requested by March 1, 2002 and
       may be addressed to itsec@nist.gov.
     * January 15, 2002 -- The draft NIST recommendation Use of the CVE
       Vulnerability Naming Scheme Within its Acquired Products and
       Information Technology Security Procedures advises agencies on the
       use of the Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) vulnerability
       naming scheme. It recommends that agencies give substantial
       consideration to buying products and services compatible with the
       CVE naming scheme. The recommendation also advises agencies to
       periodically monitor their systems for vulnerabilities listed in
       the CVE vulnerability naming scheme. Agencies are also advised to
       use the CVE naming scheme in their communications and descriptions
       of vulnerabilities. You are invited to submit any comments you may
       have to both Peter Mell and Timothy Grance at peter.mell@nist.gov
       and timothy.grance@nist.gov by February 18, 2002.
     * January 15, 2002 -- The draft NIST Special Publication 800-34,
       "Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems"
       (.pdf format) is available for public comment. The document
       provides instructions, recommendations, and considerations for
       government IT contingency planning. The information presented in
       this document addresses seven IT platform types and defines a
       seven-step contingency process that an agency may apply to develop
       and maintain a viable contingency planning program for their IT
       systems. The seven steps are designed to be integrated into each
       stage of the system development life cycle. Please provide any
       comments to Marianne Swanson at marianne.swanson@nist.gov by
       February 15, 2002.
     * December 14, 2001 -- NIST has recently developed the draft NIST
       Special Publication Security for Telecommuting and Broadband
       Communications. This document is intended to assist those
       responsible users, system administrators, and management for
       telecommuting security, by providing introductory information about
       broadband communication security and policy, security of home
       office systems, and considerations for system administrators in the
       central office. It addresses concepts relating to the selection,
       deployment, and management of broadband communications for a
       telecommuting user. We would greatly appreciate receiving any
       comments you may have! Please provide them directly to Rick Kuhn by
       January 18, 2002.
     * December 14, 2001 -- The draft Security Guide for Interconnecting
       Information Technology Systems is available for public comment. The
       document provides guidance for planning, establishing, maintaining,
       and terminating interconnections between information systems that
       are owned and operated by different organizations. We seek your
       comments and suggestions. We especially seek your comments on the
       steps for planning and establishing an interconnection, based on
       readers' experiences. Furthermore, we are interested in receiving
       comments on the memorandum of understanding/agreement development
       guide contained in the document. Please address your comments to
       Timothy Grance and Joan Hash by January 18, 2002.
     * October 9, 2001 -- A change notice for FIPS 186-2, Digital
       Signature Standard (DSS) (.pdf file), has been made available that
       addresses key sizes and random number generation. This change
       notice replaces the item that was posted on August 3, 2001,
       Recommendations Regarding Federal Information Processing Standard
       (FIPS) 186-2, Digital Signature Standard (DSS). Comments and
       questions for this recommendation are requested and may be
       addressed to FIPS186@nist.gov.

     * July 27, 2001 -- The draft "Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes
       of Operation (.pdf format)" is available for public comment. The
       recommendation updates the modes in FIPS 81 for use with any
       FIPS-approved block cipher, and specifies the counter mode.
       Comments and questions may be addressed to
       EncryptionModes@nist.gov. The deadline for the submission of
       comments is August 31, 2001.

     * June 4, 2001 -- NIST is developing Special Publication 800-30, Risk
       Management Guide (MS Word- .doc | Adobe Reader- .pdf) to provide a
       common, thorough foundation for use in the development of detailed
       risk management guidance and procedures.

       Public review is considered an important part of the NIST
       recommendation process. Any comments you have, along with
       suggestions for improvement, can be sent to
       gary.stoneburner@nist.gov by August 15, 2001.

     * May 31, 2001 -- The comment period for the draft FIPS for AES
       closed on May 29, 2001. The public comments that were received are
       available at
       http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/draftfips/comments/index.html.

     * June 1, 2001 -- NIST has announced that it is soliciting public
       comments on the Draft FIPS 180-2.

       The 90-day comment period will close on August 28, 2001. Copies of
       the Draft FIPS are available at the Secure Hashing home page.

     * May 16, 2001 -- NIST has prepared the Underlying Technical Models
       for IT Security (MS Word) | (.pdf) to provide a description of the
       technical foundations, termed models, that underlie secure
       information technology. The intent is to provide, in a concise
       form, the models that should be considered in the design and
       development of technical security capabilities.

       Public review is considered an important part of the NIST
       recommendation process. Any comments you have, along with
       suggestions for improvement, can be sent to
       gary.stoneburner@nist.gov by July 30, 2001.

     * April 24, 2001 -- The comment period for the draft FIPS for a
       Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) closed on April 5th.
       The public comments that were received are available at

     * January 5, 2001 -- NIST has published for comment a draft Federal
       Information Processing Standard for the Keyed-Hash Message
       Authentication Code (HMAC) (.pdf format). The draft specifies an
       algorithm for applications requiring message authentication, which
       is achieved through construction of a message authentication code
       based upon a crypto hash function. It allows for authentication of
       both the source of a message and its integrity. The announcement
       and information on submitting public comments (due April 5, 2001)
       are available at the HMAC home page.

     * November 17, 1999 -- NIST announces Draft FIPS 140-2, Security
       Requirements for Cryptographic Modules (.pdf) Microsoft Word

       Internet Security Policy: A Technical Guide

   NOTE:  If you are looking for a "draft" computer security publication
   and can't find it here, the draft probably has been finalized (check
   the FIPS or Special Publication link once on this page)
