  Introduction

   AFNI is a powerful, free software tool for the Analysis of Functional
   NeuroImaging,  especially FMRI. AFNI was written by Dr. Robert W. Cox
   of the Scientific and Statistical Compujting Core (SSC) of the NIMH
   Intramural Research Program. For more information, please see his AFNI
   Web Page. Another useful source of information is the AFNI Message
   Board.

   One of AFNI's most useful features is the ability to add user-written
   extensions, known as "plug-ins". These are similar to the plug-ins
   available for other popular software packages, such as Netscape. The
   user can easily program his or her own extensions, or can download
   plug-ins that others have written, to seamlessly extend the
   functionality of AFNI.

   AFNI is shipped with a number of plug-ins, such as "Power Spectrum" a
   plug-in to calcuate the frequency components of an FMRI time series
   using the fourier transform. The user is referred to the AFNI
   documentation for a complete list of plug-ins that ship with AFNI.

   Another useful package for designing and analysing event-related
   experimental designs has been written by Doug Greve at the
   MGH NMR Center. This package is freely available at
   ftp://ftp.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/pub/flat/fmri-analysis.
