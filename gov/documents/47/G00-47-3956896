                         Prostate Sample Management

   The Goal
   The ideal sample management system for molecular profiling would
   organize histopathological images, sample location and status, and
   molecular results in a searchable database. At present, there are no
   commercially available software packages that meet all of these
   criteria. Thus, the NCI Prostate Group has found it challenging to
   integrate the various components of molecular profiling studies and to
   maintain an up-to-date record of the status of each of the cases being
   studied. To address these concerns, an integrated 3D database and
   sample management systems are being developed. The prototype can be
   viewed under 3D Prostate Molecular Model Demo.

   The AutoCyte Image Management System (AIMS)
   While the 3D Model is being developed, the NCI Prostate Group has used
   the AutoCyte Image Management System (AIMS) program. This is an
   excellent software tool designed primarily for pathologists to capture
   and manage digital images of medical specimens and generate surgical
   pathology reports. Attributes of this system include:
     * The ability to acquire and store diagnostic quality images in
       folders with clinical information (Figure 1).
     * A folder concept in which information and image galleries are
       organized using a patient and case hierarchy.
     * A sophisticated search functionality (Figure 2) that provides a
       powerful and convenient way to manage medical images.
     * An annotation tool (Figure 3) that allows one to draw objects and
       text and overlay them onto images, e.g., a pathologist could
       annotate a multi-focal tumor and PIN lesions within one prostate
       specimen. Annotations and notes about particular images are stored
       in a database and may be searched to identify a subset of cases for
       a new study.
     * The advantage of archived digital images replacing slides.
