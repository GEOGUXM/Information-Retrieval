   The National Arboretum is a major center for research and education
   relating to woody ornamental and floral plants, but to many others it
   is an oasis of green within the hustle and bustle of our Nation's
   Capital. The Washington, D.C., campus of the Arboretum contains several
   world-class garden displays and plant collections that are visited by
   over 500,000 people annually. Many of these displays and collections
   are largely a result of a partnership between the private sector and
   the Federal government. icon of garden tools Private funds played major
   roles in the development of the National Herb Garden, the National
   Bonsai and Penjing Museum, the Asian Collections, and even the
   placement of the National Capitol Columns on our grounds. Thanks to
   Congress, the Arboretum was given the authority to receive gifts and to
   ask for your assistance. The Arboretum depends upon private
   contributions and donations of funds, pertinent goods and materials,
   and volunteer services. Last year, the Arboretum received over one
   million dollars in funds and services from the public.

   Not only will your gift help us preserve one of the Nation's best
   treasures, but it can also help to grow and improve our collections and
   services. Your contributions to the Arboretum are tax deductible!

   There are numerous opportunities to give. If you would like to donate
