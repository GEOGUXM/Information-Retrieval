   The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Famine Early
   Warning System Network (FEWS NET) is an information system designed to
   identify problems in the food supply system that potentially lead to
   famine, flood, or other food-insecure conditions, in sub-Saharan
   Africa. FEWS NET is a multi-disciplinary project that collects,
   analyzes, and distributes regional, national and sub-national
   information to decision makers about potential or current famine or
   flood situations, allowing them to authorize timely measures to prevent
   food-insecure conditions in these nations. Countries with FEWS NET
   representatives are Burkina Faso, Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya,
   Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Somalia,
   (southern) Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe.
