Americas Oldest Worker Recognized for a Century of Accomplishments by Assistant
Secretary Carbonell
   _____________________________________________________________________

   Josefina G. Carbonell, HHS Assistant Secretary for Aging commended
   Americas Oldest Worker, Harold Fisher, a 100-year-old architect from
   Grosse Point, Michigan at a news conference held Monday, December 10 in
   Washington, DC.

   Green Thumb, Inc., a national non-profit organization for older
   workers, recognized Mr. Fisher, believed to be the oldest practicing
   architect in America, as the highlight of their fourth annual National
   Prime Time Awards Program.

   In her remarks Assistant Secretary Carbonell, whose father is a retired
   architect, commended Mr. Fisher as a role model and an inspiration,
   saying, Not only do you, and all our older workers, continue to enhance
   Americas economy, but you also possess the values of integrity,
   dependability, and reliability that makes yours The Greatest
   Generation.

   Upon receiving his award from Green Thumb President Andrea J. Wooten,
   Mr. Fisher advised younger workers that a great personality along with
   an ability to smile and to get along with others is repaid in his
   company with love, appreciation and respect.  He added, with a smile,
   that his advice for those who want to live to be 100 is, Dont die!

   Joining in the news conference was Norman Koonce, CEO of the American
   Institute of Architects, which hosted the event.  Also honored were
   four individual outstanding older workers representing the District of
   Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

   The annual national Prime Time Awards program is held in cooperation
   with the Administration on Aging (AoA) and the Department of Labors
   Employment and Training Administration (ETA).  Green Thumb, which is
   changing its name to Experience Works in January 2002, receives funding
   with grants under Title V of the Older Americans Act (Act) administered
   by the ETA.  The AoA administers all other programs of the Act,
   providing for home and community-based services to millions of our
   nations vulnerable and hard-to-reach older persons.
