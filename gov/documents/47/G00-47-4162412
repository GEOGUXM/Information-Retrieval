   Shown here is a comparison of a Galileo color image (right) of
   Jupiter's moon Io, with a Voyager mosaic (left) reprojected to the same
   geometry as the Galileo image. The image on the right was obtained by
   the Galileo spacecraft's imaging camera on September 7th, 1996; the
   mosaic on the left was obtained by the Voyager spacecraft in 1979.
   Color is synthesized from green and violet filters only in both cases,
   as these are the only two filters that are reasonably similar between
   Voyager and Galileo. Many surface changes can be seen due to volcanic
   activity from 1979 to 1996. North is to the top of both frames. Galileo
   was about 487,000 kilometers (302,000 miles) from Io on September 7,
   1996.
