      What is the State Training Center Virtual Classroom?

      The Virtual Classroom makes some of the courses taught at the State
      Training Center available to you via the internet. Now you can take
      classes anytime, anywhere...from your desktop, laptop, or anywhere you
      have Internet access. Our courses are taught by instructors from
      California State University, Sacramento, (CSUS), and designed so you
      can take them at your own pace. If you need technical help, it's
      available 7 days a week. Continuing Education Units are awarded for
      successful course completion.

      Please take a look at our Course Topics, Dates, and Costs.

      New courses are being developed all the time, so visit us often for
      updated class information and schedules. For details on current
      courses, registration, the informational module "Introduction to Online
      Learning," and system requirements, visit the CSUS web site.
