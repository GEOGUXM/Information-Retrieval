       California School Code Mapping System
   The California Postsecondary Education Commission (CPEC) has created a
   Mapping System for California Institutions. The purpose of this mapping
   system is to provide a comprehensive set of codes used by CPEC, the
   higher education segments (California State University, University of
   California, California Community Colleges), other state agencies
   (California Department of Education), federal government such as
   National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and other educational
   organizations (College Board), etc.

   Currently, the system includes the following codes. To see a
