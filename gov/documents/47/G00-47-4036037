   Some Facts About Asbestos

   By Robert L. Virta

   This Fact Sheet briefly reviews what asbestos is, how it is identified,
   where it is found, and how it is used. The U.S. Geological Survey
   provides information on asbestos geology, mineralogy, and mining; other
   agencies listed in this fact sheet provide information on regulations
   and health effects of asbestos exposure.

   Asbestos is a generic name given to the fibrous variety of six
   naturally occurring minerals that have been used in commercial
   products. Asbestos is made up of fiber bundles. These bundles, in turn,
   are composed of extremely long and thin fibers that can be easily
   separated from one another. The bundles have splaying ends and are
   extremely flexible. The term "asbestos" is not a mineralogical
   definition. It is a commercial designation for mineral products that
   possess high tensile strength, flexibility, resistance to chemical and
   thermal degradation, and high electrical resistance and that can be
   woven.
