Natural Attenuation

   A unifying theme of Toxics Program investigations is the
   characterization of the natural response of hydrologic systems to
   contamination. This makes the sites where the investigations are
   conducted ideally suited to assessing potential long-term impacts,
   evaluating the potential and the limitations of remediation by natural
   attenuation, and designing systems to monitor the performance of
   remediation where natural attenuation is being relied upon.
