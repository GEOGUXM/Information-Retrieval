A Special Message for Travelers

   [don't.gif]

   Please take a few minutes to become familiar with restrictions on
   bringing agricultural products into the United States. This booklet
   lists acceptable or enterable agricultural products and tells you about
   other products that require permits or are prohibited.

   The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) places limits on items
   brought to the United States from foreign countries as well as those
   brought to the mainland from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin
   Islands. Prohibited items can harbor foreign animal and plant pests and
   diseases that could seriously damage America's crops, livestock, pets,
   and environment.

   Because of this threat, you are required to declare any meats, fruits,
   vegetables, plants, animals, and plant and animal products you have
   with you. Your declaration must cover all items carried in your baggage
   and hand luggage or in your vehicle.

            One Piece Can Spell Danger
            Travelers are often surprised when told that their "one little
            piece of fruit or meat" can cause serious damage. In fact, one
            item carelessly discarded can wreak havoc on American crops.
            For example, it's quite likely that a traveler carried in the
            wormy fruit that brought Mediterranean fruit flies to
            California in 1979. The 3-year fight to eradicate this pest
            cost more than $100 million. Subsequent infestations in
            California and Florida have cost even more to eradicate.
            A single link of sausage contaminated with the dreaded virus
            that causes foot-and-mouth disease could do similar damage to
            the livestock business. Foot-and-mouth disease last struck the
            United States in 1929. Economists say that an outbreak today
            would cost farmers and consumers billions of dollars in lost
            production, higher food prices, and lost export markets.
            Even when you believe that the item you are buying is safe,
            exercise caution and common sense. When you are thinking about
            buying agricultural souvenirs, remind yourself of the old
            saying, "let the buyer beware." Duty Free shops do not have
            any special authorization, clearance, or certification with
            USDA allowing them to sell prohibited products. Even if signs
            and displays say "USDA Approved," be skeptical. Please stick
            to items on the lists of approved products in this booklet,
            and always tell USDA or Customs Service inspectors everything
            you have that is an agricultural product.

              _________________________________________________________

            Declarations Prevent Fines
            The declaration you're required to make may be oral, written,
            or both. If you're traveling from abroad on a plane or ship,
            you will be given a Customs form on which to declare your
            agricultural products. You will also be asked to indicate
            whether you have visited a farm or ranch outside the United
            States.
            Officers of the Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) program
            of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
            inspect passenger baggage for agricultural products. At some
            ports, inspectors use dogs from USDA's Beagle Brigade to sniff
            out hidden items. At other ports, officials use low-energy
            x-ray machines adapted to reveal fruits and meats.
            Smugglers get caught. In an average month, inspectors find
            more than 3,000 violations. A traveler who fails to declare a
            prohibited item is fined on the spot (up to $250), and the
            item is confiscated and safely destroyed in a grinder or
            incinerator.

            Fruits, Vegetables, and Plants
            [orange.JPG] [plant.JPG]
            You may bring in some fruits, vegetables, and plants without
            advance permission, provided they are declared, inspected, and
            found free of pests. However, you must get a permit in advance
            to bring in certain plants and plant parts intended for
            growing. For information on permits, contact USDA-APHIS-PPQ's
            permit unit at the address listed in the first paragraph of
            appendix 1. To bring back endangered or threatened plant
            species, in some cases you will need permits or certificates
            from the country of origin as well as from the U.S. Department
            of the Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Please
            see appendix 1 for contact information.

            Meat and Animal Products
            [meat.JPG]
            Regulations prohibit you from bringing in fresh, dried, or
            canned meats and meat products from most foreign countries. If
            any meat is used in preparing a product, it is prohibited.
            Regulations concerning meat and meat products change
            frequently based on disease outbreaks worldwide. Contact your
            local APHIS-PPQ office for more complete information. Be
            prepared to stipulate the exact type of meat you would like to
            bring back and its country of origin.
            Hunting trophies, game-animal carcasses, and hides are
            severely restricted. If you intend to bring them in, contact
            USDA-APHIS Veterinary Services' National Center for Import and
            Export (NCIE) for applicable information and permit forms.
            Please see appendix 1 for contact information.
            FWS regulates the import and export of wild and endangered
            animals and plants and their products. More information is
            available in their free publications "Facts About Federal
            Wildlife Laws" and "Buyer Beware Guide."

            Live Animals and Birds
            [bird.JPG]
            Live animals and birds can enter the United States subject to
            certification, permits, inspection, and quarantine rules that
            vary with the animal and its origin. Dogs that have been in
            Central and South America pose a special health hazard if they
            have wounds infested with screwworms. If your dog has even a
            small wound, be sure to have it treated before you travel to
            the United States.
            Pet birds obtained overseas may be imported into the United
            States if quaratined in a USDA Animal Import Center for a
            minimum of 30 days. Quarantine arrangements must be made in
            advance because facilities are limited and are available only
            at certain ports of entry.
            Personally owned U.S. Pet birds returning to the United States
            that have been out of the country for more than 60 days, must
            be quarantined for 30 days in the owner's home. These birds
            must be accompanied by the original U.S. veterinary health
            certificate that was issued prior to leaving the United
            States. This certificate must individually identify each bird
            by a leg band, tattoo, or microchip identification number.
            There is no Federal quarantine required for pet birds
            originating in Canada. However, an inspection by an USDA
            veterinarian must be conducted for all pet birds entering the
            United States. Please see appendix 1 for contact information.
            The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
            regulate importation of certain animal species and have
            specific regulations regarding pets (including cats and dogs)
            and nonhuman primates. CDC require that pet dogs and cats
            appear healthy upon visual inspection at the port of entry.
            Cats may be imported without further restriction. Dogs coming
            from a country that is not free of rabies must be accompanied
            by proof that rabies vaccination is current and was
            administered at least 30 days before arrival in the United
            States.
            Young puppies may be imported without proof of rabies
            vaccination but must be confined at a place of the owner's
            choice until they are 3 months of age and then vaccinated.
            Confinement must then continue for 30 days. Monkeys and other
            nonhuman primates may not be imported for use as pets under
            any circumstances; importation for scientific or exhibition
            purposes is strictly controlled through a registration
            process.
            Turtles with shells that are less than 4 inches long may not
            be imported for commercial purposes. You may import as many as
            six turtles with shells at least 4 inches long (or a
            combination of turtles and viable eggs not exceeding six) for
            your personal use as pets. A permit issued by CDC must
            accompany live bats and certain snails.
            Animals (other than birds) taken out of the United States are
            subject, upon return, to the same requirements as those
            entering for the first time. More detailed information can be
            found in the U.S. Customs Service Publication 509, "Pets and
            Wildlife." For further information, contact CDC at the address
            listed in appendix 1.

              _________________________________________________________

            Other Biological Materials
            You must have a permit to bring in most organisms, cells and
            cultures, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and related
            substances, whether of plant or animal origin. This category
            includes organisms and products used in the biotechnology
            industry. For information and a permit application, contact
            NCIE or PPQ's permit unit.
            USDA does not require permits for dead insects, including
            butterflies. Biological specimens of plant pests, in
            preservatives or dried, may be imported without restrictions
            but are subject to inspection on arrival in the United States
            to confirm the nature of the material and make sure it is free
            of hitchhiking plant pests or diseases. Please remember to
            declare these items and present them for inspection.
            Collectors should check in advance with FWS to determine the
            procedures for specimens of threatened and endangered species.

              _________________________________________________________

            Soil, Sand, Minerals, and Shells
            Soilborne organisms threaten both plants and animals. If you
            visited a farm or ranch overseas, agricultural inspectors may
            have to disinfect your shoes or clothes. Vehicles must also be
            cleaned of soil.
            You may not bring in any soil or earth that is not accompanied
            by a permit. The permit is issued in advance by PPQ's permit
            unit. Pure sand, like a small container of decorative beach
            sand, is allowed. Rocks, minerals, and shells are allowed, but
            all sand and soil must be cleaned off them. Products grown in
            soil (like shamrocks and truffles) must be free of soil.

            What You Can Bring Back
            When you plan your trip abroad, check the list of approved
            products. Keep in mind that this list is not all inclusive.
            Also, whether or not an item you are bringing into this
            country appears on the list of approved products, you are
            still responsible for declaring to a Federal inspection
            officer every agricultural product in your possession.
            Note that if you leave the United States with any U.S.
            agricultural products, you may not be allowed to bring them
            back in when you return to the country. Check with a U.S.
            border official before taking such goods across the border.
            If you're unsure of what's allowed, call for help. Look in
            your phone book for the nearest office of USDA, APHIS, PPQ; or
            call PPQ's central office at (301) 734-8645. If your question
            is specific to animals or animal products, contact NCIE. U.S.
            consulates abroad may also be able to answer many of your
            questions. In addition, APHIS' Internet site at
            www.aphis.usda.gov provides information on this and other
            related topics.
            Other Federal agencies have regulations pertaining to items
            that are allowed or prohibited entry into the United States as
            well. The U.S. Customs Service publishes the brochure "Know
            Before You Go (Customs Hints for Returning Residents)," and
            the U.S. State Department publishes the brochure "Your Trip
            Abroad" with general information for travelers. Please see
            appendix 1 for contact information.
