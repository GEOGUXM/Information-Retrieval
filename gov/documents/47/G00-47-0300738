   Through publications and news releases the USGS disseminates Chesapeake
   Bay information to several target audiences. The primary audience is
   the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP).

   [w_spacer.gif]   white image spacer The CBP, consisting of over 25
   Federal Agencies, 6 States and the District of Columbia, and local
   customers and partners requires USGS research, monitoring and
   predictive models about the Bay and its watershed to help formulate and
   evaluate restoration strategies. USGS Chesapeake Bay science
   information also has critical relevance for the restoration of
   ecosystems throughout the United States. Therefore, other target
   audiences include scientific organizations, representatives of
   Congress, the Department of the Interior (DOI), and the USGS.

   The USGS has published reports and journal articles on a large number
   of topics related to the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed. Some of the
   more recent reports are online. Others can be ordered by calling
   1-888-ASK-USGS (1-888-275-8747).

News Releases

   The USGS prepares a monthly news release about the amount of freshwater
   entering the Bay. This information is useful to help understand changes
   in the bay's water quality and living resources. Other news releases
   are prepared to announce selected reports and the associated scientific
   findings. The most recent press release is Below Normal Rainfall and
   Warm Temperatures Lead to Record Low Water Levels in
   December(01/04/02). Visit the Online Press Releases and News Advisories
   site for online press releases since January 1996.

   We welcome comments and suggestions on this redesigned site.
