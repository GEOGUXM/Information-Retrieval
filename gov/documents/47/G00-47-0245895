   GTE PEM-Tropics A CD-ROM

   This CD-ROM contains data from the Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE)
   Pacific Exploratory Mission in the Tropics (PEM-Tropics A) conducted in
   August-September 1996. The mission involved the NASA DC-8, with flights
   originating from Papeete, Tahiti; Easter Island, Christchurch, New
   Zealand; and Nadi, Fiji, and the P-3B aircraft, with flights
   originating from Christmas Island; Papeete, Tahiti; Easter Island, and
   Guayaquil, Ecuador. The data on this CD-ROM consist of in situ and
   remotely sensed measurements collected onboard the DC-8 aircraft; in
   situ measurements collected aboard the P-3B aircraft; radiosonde and
   ozonesonde balloon soundings; satellite images with the DC-8 or P-3B
   flight track; fire count data for Africa and Australia; calculations of
   air parcel back trajectories and meteorological parameters along the
   DC-8 and P-3B flight paths; and data files of DC-8 and P-3B in situ
   measurements merged to several common time bases.

   AirMISR

   AirMISR (Airborne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) is an
   instrument flown on the ER-2 aircraft for obtaining multi-angle imagery
   similar to the satellite-borne MISR instrument. AirMISR flies in
   support of various field campaigns. The first available data set is
   from the KONza Validation EXperiment (KONVEX) over the Kansas prairie
   for July 13, 1999. (72 data files, 108 images, 2 Gb)

   Access the AirMISR data.

   NARSTO PM2.5 (Houston)

      The City of Houston, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
      Commission, and the Houston Regional Monitoring Network sponsored
      sampling and analysis of PM2.5 samples taken over the course of one
      year, from 03/11/1997 to 03/12/1998. Objectives of the study were to
      determine the levels and chemical composition of PM2.5 in Houston and
      other cities in Texas and to determine the background levels and
      chemical composition of PM2.5 transported into Houston.

      The NARSTO_Texas_PM2.5_Sampling_and_Analysis_Study:_1997-1998 is now
      available from the Langley Data Center.

Terra Data Available

   Data and images from the CERES, MISR, and MOPITT instruments aboard the
   Terra spacecraft are available. Image representing Terra. On February
   24, 2000, Terra began collecting what will ultimately become a new,
   15-year global data set on which to base scientific investigations
   about our complex home planet. There are three other EOS satellites
   currently in orbit and fifteen more will follow over the next four
   years. Together these spacecraft will help scientists unravel the
   mysteries of climate and environmental change. Visit the Terra home
   page to learn more about the spacecraft.

CERES

   CERES (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) measures the
   Earth's radiation budget and atmospheric radiation from the top of the
   atmosphere using a broadband scanning radiometer. Initially released
   products consisted of CERES instrument and ERBE-like data from the
   Terra satellite. Image from CERES showing energy loss. The two CERES
   instruments on Terra successfully began operations on Friday, February
   25, 2000. In normal operations one instrument scans perpendicular to
   the Terra ground track in order to spatially sample the Earth. The
   other instrument samples the angular distribution of radiation. This
   image from February 26, 2000 shows the energy being lost from the Earth
   and the atmosphere by thermal emission. The blue colors originate from
   cold scenes, while the red colors are from hotter regions of the Earth.

MISR

   MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) measures
   top-of-atmosphere, cloud and surface angular reflectance functions, and
   measures surface BRDF, aerosol and vegetation properties using four
   spectral bands in each of nine pushbroom imaging cameras oriented at
   different angles along-track. Initially released MISR products
   consisted of Level 1 Radiance data from five Terra orbits. Image from
   MISR over James Bay. These MISR images of Hudson and James Bays were
   acquired on February 24, 2000. The true-color image on the left is from
   the downward-looking camera. The false-color image on the right is a
   composite of red band data taken by the forward, nadir and aftward
   cameras displayed in blue, green, and red colors. This example
   illustrates how multi-angle viewing can distinguish physical structures
   and textures. The images are about 400 kilometers wide.

MOPITT

   MOPITT (Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere) measures carbon
   monoxide and methane in the troposphere using correlation spectroscopy
   with pressure modulated and length modulated gas cells. Initially
   released MOPITT products consisted of Level 1 data. Image from MOPITT
   representing surface temperatures. The MOPITT instrument aboard Terra
   measures radiance in several channels to determine the amount of carbon
   monoxide (CO) and methane in the atmosphere. This image acquired on
   March 3, 2000 shows difference radiances which are sensitive to the
   temperature of the Earth's surface, the temperature of the atmosphere,
   and the amount of CO. Of these, the first two effects dominate. Thus,
   we see red colors, indicating high radiances and high surface
   temperatures from the subtropical deserts
