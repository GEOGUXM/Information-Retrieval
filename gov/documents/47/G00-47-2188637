   Welcome to Albuquerque Operations

   Albuquerque Operations Office is the major defense program field
   organization in the Department of Energy. Although its roots can be
   traced to the Manhattan Engineering District's efforts to provide the
   nation with a nuclear weapons capability, AL did not officially come
   into existence as a civilian organization until the establishment of
   the Atomic Energy Commission in 1956. Today, in managing a national
   program, our primary mission continues to be stewardship and
   maintenance of the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile. But as the
   Atomic Energy Commission evolved into its successor organizations, our
   mission portfolio diversified. In addition to our national security
   mission, we now also devote significant resources to restoring and
   improving the environmental quality of our operations, and extending
   the contributions of our national laboratories to basic and applied
   research in science and technology.

   We hope the information included in our Web site is useful,
   informative, and meets your expectations. As with all our efforts, we
   encourage suggestions and welcome your ideas for making it a better Web
   site.
