   Outreach Newsletter

   NIMH Outreach is an information resource about the National Institute
   of Mental Health's Constituency Outreach and Education Program and
   related topics. The Spring 2001 issue marks a particularly exciting
   milestone for the program, as we now have Outreach Partners in all 50
   States and the District of Columbia (listed in this issue on page 3).
   The first issue was completed in Summer 2000.

   Both issues appear below in *PDF and HTML formats. Web URL links can
   connect directly to the indicated sites. Like all other NIMH materials
   on this website, the NIMH Outreach newsletter is a document in the
   public domain and can therefore be downloaded and reproduced without
   further permission.
