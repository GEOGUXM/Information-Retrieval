     Silber and Associates Survey of ATP Awardees (02/12/96)

    The Silber study provides a comprehensive statistical analysis of one
      critical dimension of the success of the ATP: the progress of the
       organizations that conceive and carry out the R&D projects. The
    progress of these organizations in achieving their research goals --
    and the extent to which the ATP enables and accelerates that progress
   -- are critical factors not only in the development of the technologies
         but in the rapid application and commercialization of those
   technologies downstream from the ATP project. The survey was conducted
    by an experienced Ph.D. and included 150 questions. It covered all 60
        ATP projects initiated between 1990 and 1992 and 125 projects
                                participants.
