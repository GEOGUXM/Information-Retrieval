     __________________________________________________________________

   The Secretary of State's Office is the central filing office for
   certain financing statements and other lien documents provided for in
   the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). Filing with our office serves to
   perfect a security interest in named collateral and establish priority
   in case of debtor default or bankruptcy.
   Judgment liens, attachment liens, agricultural liens and equipment
   liens are also filed in the UCC section, as well as various tax liens
   submitted by state and federal taxing agencies such as the Franchise
   Tax Board and the Internal Revenue Service.
   On July 1, 2001, significant changes became effective under Revised
   Article 9 (RA9) of the Uniform Commercial Code. Chapter 5 of RA9 deals
   specifically with filing and the filing officer's responsibilities. If
   interested, you may want to attend one of our UCC RA9 Workshops.
   Filing office changes are highlighted in our Revised Article 9 pages to
   facilitate the awareness and understanding of the new requirements.
