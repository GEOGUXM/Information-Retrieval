   BIOGRAPHY

   [sv_bio_image.jpg] U.S. Senator George Voinovich

   Throughout his distinguished career in service to the people of Ohio,
   U.S. Senator George Voinovich has strived to make government "work
   harder and smarter and do more with less." These words provide good
   insight into the man who helped turn Cleveland around after it became
   the first major city to declare bankruptcy since the Depression, and
   who led the transformation of Ohio state government into a model of
   efficiency and effectiveness while controlling state spending and
   improving the quality of services. He builds on this legacy now as
   Ohio's U.S. Senator by listening to the people of the state he loves,
   and working to affect the change they need to make Ohio and our nation
   a better, stronger place.

   "How Does It Help Ohio?"

   Everything Senator Voinovich does has as its goal improving the lives
   of the people of Ohio. The simple question, "How does it help Ohio?"
   has always been central to his work. His roots in Ohio are deep and his
   focus on communities is strong. Senator Voinovich lives in the same
   Cleveland neighborhood where he grew up and returns to Ohio almost
   every weekend. His top priority is to meet with Ohioans and learn
   firsthand their thoughts and needs. Therefore, he keeps a busy schedule
   criss-crossing Ohio meeting with the people he serves. Senator
   Voinovich also maintains four Senate offices across the state staffed
   by representatives, and he maintains a joint casework office with Sen.
   Mike DeWine to help Ohioans solve problems with federal agencies and
   programs.

   Children and Families

   As a long-time and passionate advocate for early childhood education,
   Senator Voinovich has made improving access to preschool programs like
   Head Start his top priority. As governor of Ohio, Voinovich made such
   significant improvements to Head Start that Ohio became the national
   leader in state support for Head Start, the national leader in the
   percentage of eligible children served by Head Start, and the first
   state to provide broad distribution of distance learning training for
   early childhood educators. In the Senate, Voinovich introduced and the
   Senate passed, legislation that recruits more Head Start teachers so
   that the program could be expanded and improved to make sure more
   disadvantaged children have the opportunity to start school ready to
   learn.

   To help improve the quality of life for America's families and
   children, Voinovich has encouraged federal agencies to cooperate better
   in human service efforts, especially early childhood development.
   Modeled after the successful Families and Children First Initiative he
   introduced as Ohio's governor, which facilitated inter-agency
   cooperation to improve family support services, and Voinovich held
   hearings in his Subcommittee on the Oversight of Government Management
   to better coordinate efforts between the departments of Health and
   Human Services (HHS) and Education (ED). The hearings initiated a
   40-person task force made up of members from HHS and ED to focus on
   improving collaboration between the two agencies and completed a report
   to Senator Voinovich's Subcommittee in September 2000 outlining the
   three areas where HHS and ED have decided to focus their attention in
   order to increase collaboration.

   Freeing Americans From the Debt Burden

   Senator Voinovich has quickly become known as the U.S. Senate's leading
   "debt hawk" thanks to his work to focus attention on the need to pay
   down our nation's huge $5.6 trillion national debt. Our nation's
   unprecedented economic growth in recent years has provided a unique
   opportunity for the federal government to direct enormous resources to
   debt reduction - if only Congress will demonstrate the will to make it
   happen. Senator Voinovich continues to push his colleagues and the
   President to do more to pay down the national debt so that the 14
   percent of federal funding that currently goes to debt interest
   payments can be rerouted to other more important needs like Social
   Security and Medicare.

   [sv_image2.jpg] Making Government Work Better

   Because Ohioans work hard for their money, Senator Voinovich has always
   lived by the principle that government should work just as hard with
   the tax dollars Ohioans entrust to their government. Though government
   management is certainly not an issue that attracts the spotlight of
   attention, Senator Voinovich believes that the key to keeping
   government spending down and giving taxpayers the best services for
   their dollar, is making sure government programs and systems are well
   managed. In the process, he has earned national recognition as a leader
   in government management and improving the way government works.

   With half of all federal employees eligible for regular or early
   retirement by 2004, Senator Voinovich has become a leader in the effort
   to make sure this wave of retirements does not undermine our national
   security and cripple the federal government's ability to provide basic,
   needed services like Social Security. Through aggressive oversight and
   focused legislative changes, Senator Voinovich is working to make sure
   the federal government has the tools necessary to recruit and retain
   the skilled employees required to meet our country's changing needs.

   Controlling Government's Urge to Spend

   In the short time he has been in the Senate, Senator Voinovich's work
   to control government spending has brought him accolades from some of
   this nation's most prestigious business and advocacy groups.

   The Concord Coalition recognized Senator Voinovich as the Senate's most
   fiscally responsible Republican, giving him the highest rating in its
   2000 review. He also has been awarded the prestigious "Golden Bulldog
   Award" by the Watchdogs of the Treasury, supporting "realistic federal
   spending and controlling runaway debt."

   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce awarded Senator Voinovich its Spirit of
   Enterprise Award in 1999 for his support of "better jobs, increased
   productivity, and economic growth which go hand in hand with the
   success of American business." The National Federation of Independent
   Business named Senator Voinovich a "Guardian of Small Business" for
   1999-2000 and the National Association of Manufacturers presented the
   Senator its "Award for Manufacturing Excellence" for his support for
   American business and America's workforce in the 106th Congress.

   [sv_bio2.jpg] Defending American Interests at Home and Around the World

   Senator Voinovich believes that it is the fundamental responsibility of
   the federal government to protect its citizens from domestic and
   international threats. He has been active on many fronts regarding our
   nation's defense from helicopter safety to helping shape international
   policies. He understands that maintaining our nation's technological
   edge is key to protecting our citizens, which is why he continues to
   support millions of dollars in federal funding for Wright-Patterson Air
   Force Base so that the important technology and science work conducted
   at the base can continue.

   Voinovich considers one of his most significant accomplishments in the
   Senate his victory to enact legislation to provide Cold War-era defense
   workers made sick from exposure to life-threatening materials monetary
   compensation and lifetime health benefits. He has continued to work
   with Secretary Chao and the Bush Administration to ensure that these
   defense workers, wrongfully made ill while helping to keep the United
   States secure, are properly compensated.

   Since his arrival in the Senate, Senator Voinovich has played a leading
   role in shaping and implementing our nation's policy towards the
   Balkans. During the conflict, the senator visited the Balkans region
   with several colleagues in an effort to better understand the
   political, military and humanitarian issues facing the region. After
   witnessing firsthand the suffering of the Kosovo refugees, the
   continued plight of refugees from the Bosnia wars, and the poor state
   of the economies in the region, Senator Voinovich began to work on
   humanitarian relief and long-term economic prosperity in the aftermath
   of the bombing campaign. As a member of the Commission on Security and
   Cooperation in Europe, or the Helsinki Commission, he remains active in
   international policies and recently traveled to Lithuania to attend the
   NATO Parliamentary Assembly to discuss NATO expansion.
   Charting a New Course as Governor

   In 1990 Ohio was in recession and the state was faced with a looming
   budget shortfall. Though not an easy way to start a new job as
   governor, Voinovich was no stranger to governments in crisis. Though
   facing tough opposition, he curbed state spending and was able to
   balance the budget. It was the beginning of a wave of reforms of state
   government he led as governor that saw state spending curbed and
   budgetary growth held to its lowest rate in 30 years. Voinovich also
   established a rainy-day fund of almost $1 billion and enacted tax
   reductions for three straight years including a 10 percent cut in 1998
   for a total of $24 billion. He helped end the era of welfare dependence
   in Ohio by leading the nation in providing job training to welfare
   recipients. As a result, more than 362,000 were able to move from
   welfare to work.

   Under the Voinovich Administration, Ohio's unemployment rate fell to a
   25-year low - with more than 500,000 new jobs created - and Ohio was
   ranked first in the nation by Site Selection magazine for new and
   expanded business facilities. Voinovich also transformed Ohio's Bureau
   of Workers' Compensation from a bloated and expensive program that
   failed injured workers and hindered new job creation, into a lean
   well-managed service responsive to injured workers and employers. In so
   doing, he saved Ohio businesses and local governments more than $4
   billion. His service as governor, his dedication to the citizens of
   Ohio, and his ability to lead people to give their best and their all,
   earned him Governing magazine's "Public Official of the Year" for 1995.

   Architect of the Cleveland Turn-Around

   While serving as lieutenant governor in 1979 and well on his way to a
   career in statewide elected office, George Voinovich was asked by
   Cleveland's community leaders to come back to his hometown and serve as
   mayor. Cleveland has just become the first major city since the
   Depression to declare bankruptcy. He responded to this call for help
   and quickly put in place a unique system of public-private partnerships
   drawing upon the best minds in government and industry to rebuild city
   government and restore the public's pride and confidence in their city.
   The coalition that Voinovich led brought Cleveland back from the brink
   and today, thanks to the continued efforts of the city's leaders,
   Cleveland is a thriving, renewed community and a validation of
   Voinovich's first motto: "Together we can do it."

   [sv_bio3.jpg] His work as mayor earned him wide recognition, from being
   named one of four distinguished urban mayors in America by the National
   Urban Coalition, to being called "one of the top three mayors in
   America" by City and State magazine. Under his leadership, Cleveland
   was the only city in America to be named an "All-American City" three
   times in a five-year period.

   Senator Voinovich is married to Janet, his wife of 37 years. Together,
   they have three children, George, Betsy and Peter, three granddaughters
   and one grandson.
