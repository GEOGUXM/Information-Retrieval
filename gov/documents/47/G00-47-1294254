   When the Weather Outside Is Frightful
   By Pat Wood

   [snowwindow.gif] Many people may snuggle up in front of a warm
   fireplace when winter weather hits, but others may have fewer options.

   Perhaps they have no fireplace, maybe not even a place at all if they
   are homeless.

   Or maybe they have a house, but what if they dont have enough money to
   pay the heating bill, what with the rise in the price of oil?

   Whether we are rich or poor or somewhere in between, government
   resources and information online may help us say, "Let it snow, let it
   snow, let it snow. Were prepared, were prepared, were prepared."

   These government webpages will help you and your communities get
   prepared for winter.
