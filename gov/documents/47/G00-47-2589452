CCTC Apple Internships

     Internships allow an individual to be the teacher of record, or to
     serve as a counselor or administrator, while completing an organized
     professional preparation program. In California, there are two
     distinct types of internship programs. University internships are
     cooperative programs between a university and an employing school
     district that are administered by the university. University
     internships include teaching, counseling, school psychology, and
     administration programs. District internships are for teachers only
     and are administered by employing school districts. These programs
     may or may not involve university course work. Both types of
     internship programs result in a preliminary or professional clear
     credential. California also has a pre-internship program. It is
     designed to provide support and assistance to individuals who still
     need to meet the subject-matter requirement before entering an
     internship program. The leaflets listed below should answer your
     questions about internship programs. See also "Application

CCTC Apple Emergency Permits

     There is currently a shortage of teachers in California. In order to
     help employers fill vacant teaching positions, the Commission has
     established requirements for emergency permits. Each year an
     employer must file a Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified
     Educators with the Commission if the employer will need to hire
     individuals who do not yet possess teaching credentials to fill
     teaching positions. Once the Declaration is on file, the employer
     may apply for emergency permits for qualified individuals.
     Applicants may not apply directly to the Commission for these
     documents. The requirements for emergency permits are explained in
     the leaflets listed below and include, at a minimum, possession of a
     bachelor's degree and passage of CBEST. See also "Application
