The Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Tucson A.Z. has launched a new public
service called Expert Forum on Honey Bees. Expert Forum on Honey Bees is a
state of the art, user-friendly electronic question and answer information
resource available to all at no cost via the Internet.

                                 How To Use

     * When you click on the link below the Expert Forum window appears in
       which you are able to browse questions from a list that appears,
       perform multiple word searches or, ask an original question
       directly to Thomas Deeby and other experts here at the center and
       receive your answer by e-mail.
       Browse Question List

You may simply scroll through our list of questions and click on any of
interest to you. The complete answer will then appear.

"Keyword" Search

You may perform multiple word searches using the box labeled "keyword" at the
bottom right of the Expert Forum window. Enter your word or topic of interest
and click on the small magnifying glass to the right of the keyword box.
Clicking on the question allows you to view the entire answer.

Ask A Question

In order to ask a direct question of our Experts, select a forum, then click
on the envelope icon located in the lower right hand corner of our Expert
Forum window. Enter your question and e-mail address and click on the
envelope icon to the right. You will receive an answer by e-mail in a short
period of time.

   Important note: Since Expert Forum on Honey Bees sends the answer to
   your e-mail address, please make sure that you carefully input the
   e-mail address to which you wish to receive the answer. Also, since the
   e-mailed answer will have a system-generated address please disable any
   "spam guards," junk e-mail filters, or firewalls for a few days to
   ensure that the answer gets to you. If the answer doesn't reach you
   within a few days, please check Expert Forum on Honey Bees to see if
   your question has been answered and published without your having
   received the e-mail.
   The public will play a key role in developing this Expert Forum on
   Honey Bees. Thomas Deeby and other experts at the center will answer
   each relevant question, asked by any participant. Thereafter, both the
   question and answer will be edited and published in a permanent
   database. Answers to subsequent inquiries will thus be available to
   anyone, any time, day or night, seven days a week. Answers will be
   reviewed and updated as new information becomes available.

The public is invited to ask questions and help expand the Forum for the
benefit of all.
