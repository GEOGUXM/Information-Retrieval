   Cell Signaling Team

      Scientists in the Cell Signaling Team, working closely with leading
      experimental laboratories (e.g., Dr. Henry Metzger's laboratory at
      NIH), are attempting to develop predictive mathematical and
      computational models for the early steps in immunoreceptor signaling.
      The team is led by Byron Goldstein. Other scientists in the team
      include Bill Hlavacek, a new staff member, Tony Redondo, group leader
      of the Theoretical Chemistry & Molecular Physics group at LANL (T-12),
      and Carla Wofsy, who also holds an appointment as Professor in the
      Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New
      Mexico. The team is supported by NIH and DOE. For more information, see
      the team's home page.
