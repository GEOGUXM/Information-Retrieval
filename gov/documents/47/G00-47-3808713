Key Facts

   Date of incident: Mining activity began in late 1800s, peaked in late
   1940s-1950s
   Location: An inactive mine site in the Panther creek watershed, a
   tributary of the Salmon River in east central Idaho
   Trustees: NOAA, State of Idaho and the U.S. Forest Service
   Source: Inactive mine site
   Release: Copper and other hazardous materials
   Primary Injury: Loss of chinook salmon and steelhead habitat
   Restoration: Reintroduction of chinook salmon and in-kind habitat
   restoration (estimated cost $5.2 million)

                                SITE SUMMARY

   Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon (listed as threatened under
   the Endangered Species Act) were eliminated from Panther Creek by the
   early 1960s due to hazardous substances contamination.

   Panther Creek is one of the larger tributaries of the Salmon River and
   historically supported substantial runs of chinook salmon (2,000 adults
   returning annually). The stream also supported significant numbers of
   steelhead.

   In 1993, NOAA joined the State of Idaho and the U.S. Forest Service in
   a Natural Resource Damage Assessment and conducted extensive studies to
   determine the scope and scale of injuries caused by the Blackbird Mine.
   The trustees also developed a cost-effective program to restore injured
   resources to baseline, and to compensate the public for losses incurred
   in the period from the initial injury until completed restoration. Dam
   construction, as well as other factors not related to the mine, caused
   a significant decline in the number of fish returning annually to
   Salmon River Basin streams. The injury assessment, accounting for the
   depressed status of chinook salmon resources due to all factors,
   calculated that 200 adult chinook salmon were no longer returning
   annually to Panther Creek due to the release of hazardous substances.
   In 1993, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed the site to
   its National Priorities List for further investigation and possible
   cleanup under Superfund authorities. In 1994, EPA initiated a Remedial
   Investigation/Feasibility Study for site cleanup.

   The Settlement: The Consent Decree settling the case requires the
   parties responsible for the release to restore the water quality in
   Panther Creek by 2002. The responsible parties are also required to
   fund a program to reintroduce chinook salmon to Panther Creek;
   implement a Biological Restoration and Compensation Plan (BRCP) to
   restore, enhance, and create anadromous and resident salmonid habitat
   in site-impacted and out-of-basin streams; fund trustee oversight of
   BRCP implementation; and reimburse trustees' past damage assessment
   costs.

                                 RESTORATION

   Restoration activities in Panther Creek are being designed to improve
   water quality; restore, enhance, and create chinook salmon and
   steelhead habitat; and reintroduce spring/summer chinook salmon.

   Restoration Activites include:
     * Restore water quality in Panther Creek to support all life stages
       of salmonids
     * Reintroduce spring/summer chinook salmon to Panther Creek
     * Realign a section of Panther Creek to create and improve salmon and
       steelhead spawning and rearing habitat
     * Create off-channel habitat in Panther Creek to improve juvenile
       salmonid rearing conditions
     * Construct livestock exclusion fencing to restore degraded riparian
       habitats and improve spawning and rearing conditions for salmon and
       steelhead

   Major biological components of the restoration plan include:
     * Restoration of spring/summer chinook salmon to Panther Creek --
       production will be initiated by the introduction of progeny from a
       suitable donor stock. To accelerate run restoration, a fish
       barrier/trap and acclimation ponds will be maintained on Panther
       Creek for a period of time to capture returning adults and imprint
       juveniles.
     * Realignment of 1.2 miles of a straightened and channelized section
       of Panther Creek to conform to its natural meander pattern -- to
       improve and create salmon and steelhead spawning and rearing
       habitat.
     * Creation of off-channel habitat in Panther Creek -- to improve
       juvenile salmonid rearing conditions.
     * Fencing of 2.0 miles of heavily-grazed private land along Panther
       Creek, and 5.0 to 8.0 miles of heavily-grazed private land along
       other Salmon River Basin tributaries -- to allow regeneration of
       riparian vegetation and improve spawning and rearing conditions for
       salmon and steelhead.

   The responsible parties will implement components of the restoration
   plan with trustee oversight. Implementation will proceed over a period
   of years, with measures timed to coincide with water quality
   remediation. All decisions regarding implementation will be made by a
   Trustee Council comprised of representatives from NOAA, the U.S. Forest
   Service, and the State of Idaho. The responsible parties are arranging
   cattle exclusion provisions outside of Panther Creek and finalizing
   plans for projects after Panther creek water quality is restored. The
   trustees are working closely with EPA to ensure a coordinated,
   cost-effective remediation and restoration strategy.
