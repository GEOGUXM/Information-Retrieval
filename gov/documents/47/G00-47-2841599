   Doing Your Part Reporting Drug Smuggling
   1-800-BE-ALERT

   Drugs and drug smuggling pose a significant threat to America and are a
   major cause of crime and social ills in our society. The U.S. Customs
   Service is in the forefront in the effort to rid the country of illegal
   drugs. As the primary border agency of the nation, the U.S. Customs
   Service maintains high tech aircraft, vessels, and surveillance devices
   to help detect and interdict illegal drugs at or before they reach our
   borders.

   The policing of the thousands of miles of land and sea borders can be
   and is a daunting task. With limited resources and strained budgets,
   the U.S. Customs Service has done a remarkable job over the years in
   interdicting illegal drugs destined for American streets. The literally
   millions of pounds of illegal drugs seized by Customs officers is a
   testament to the commitment shown by the Customs Service to the drug
   interdiction mission.

   Because policing the borders is a daunting task, the U.S. Customs
   Service seeks the help of the public in the fight against drugs and
   drug smuggling. The public is urged to report suspected drug smuggling
   activity to the nearest U.S. Customs Office or call the 24 hour tipline
   at: 1-800-BE-ALERT.
