   NRCS Overview

      The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is the federal agency
      that works with private landowners to help them protect their natural
      resources.

      NRCS conservationists spend most of their time on agricultural
      land-cropland, and grazing land-the predominant use of private lands in
      South Dakota. They work in close cooperation with conservation
      districts through field offices that serve every county in the state.

      The agency emphasizes voluntary, science-based assistance,
      partnerships, and cooperative problem solving at the community level
      through the locally-led conservation process.

      Rural and urban communities seek our help in curbing erosion,
      conserving and protecting water, and solving other resource problems.
      We help local Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D) councils
      identify and solve human, economic, and environmental problems. Local,
      state, and federal agencies, policymakers, and special-use districts
      also rely on NRCS expertise.

      American Indian tribes work with NRCS on a variety of initiatives that
      include resource inventories and the adaptation of our conservation
      programs to fit the special needs of their people and their land.

      To help sustain our natural resources and the environment, NRCS
      provides leadership in a partnership effort to help people conserve,
      improve, and sustain our natural resources including soil, water, air,
      plants, and animals.

      Conservation Districts - USDA has a unique partnership with
      conservation districts. All 69 conservation districts in South Dakota
      have working mutual agreements with the United States Department of
      Agriculture (USDA) and the State of South Dakota. Conservation
      districts provide grassroots input to USDA through the Natural
      Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Local conservation district
      boards of supervisors are composed of five elected officials.
      Conservation districts are organized statewide, often following county
      boundaries. They generally are collocated with NRCS in USDA Service
      Centers.

      The South Dakota Association of Conservation Districts can be contacted
      by e-mail at: consrvSD@cam-walnet.com or at their website:
      www.sd.nacdnet.org/index.html

      Other Partners: The conservation partnership continues to expand where
      the goals of individuals, agencies, and groups are in harmony with our
      mission of helping people, conserve, improve, and sustain our natural
      resources and environment.
