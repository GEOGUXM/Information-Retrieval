ISTP/IACG CDAW Data Base

To: Solar Physics/Space Weather Community
From: Nat Gopalswamy

The Coordinated Data Analysis workshops (CDAW) have proven to be  the preferred
mode of data analysis  in recent times, especially when large data bases
involving multi-spacecraft data in conjunction with ground based data are
involved. The series of SOHO-Yohkoh CDAWs have resulted in very productive
collaborations  and scientific exchanges.  Taking this one step forward,  we
conducted an ISTP/IACG workshop (http://orpheus.nascom.nasa.gov) on  'Global
Picture of Solar Eruptive Events'  where data pre-processing was a unique
feature  so  the participants could  concentrate on extracting science from the
data sets rather than spending time on basic data handling. This proved to be
extremely useful  and a number of projects were identified and pursued.  The
workshop was conducted with the help of  scientists associated with  ISTP
missions  (especially SOHO and Wind),  SDAC and NSSDC.   The primary aim of the
workshop was to obtain a global perspective  and a "generic picture" of the
solar eruptive events  from the time they originate from the Sun to the time
they reach 1 AU and perhaps beyond. Towards this end, the following 5 topics
were addressed during the workshop:

          1. Near-surface manifestations
          2. Coronal Dimming and Arcade Formation
          3. Magnetic Field Changes
          4. Sources of Energetic Particles
          5. CMEs and Magnetic Clouds Science Program

Data were assembled from a number of space missions (SOHO, Yohkoh, Wind,  ACE,
IPM-8, CGRO, GOES, Ulysses) and from ground based instruments (Nobeyama
radioheliograph,  Nancay Radioheliograph,  Potsdam, Hiraiso,
SOONSPOT,  Nancay Decametric, RSTN and MLSO).  The CDAWeb data base was also
effectively used during the workshop. By the time we assembled all the data in
one place,  the data set was huge: ~ 20 GB.  The data base consisted
of solar imagery, interplanetary time series data and metric and longer
wavelength radio burst data. The participants found the preprocessed  very
useful so they could  look at plots,  movies and overlays  of images without
having to deal with the raw data.  All the necessary software tools were also
made available for new data analysis are improve upon
existing  analysis.  Several projects were identified during the workshop by the
five working groups.  Data analysis  has continued after the workshop and an
international conference  (http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/solar_events/) is
planned in Spring 2000 when the data would have been analyzed in more detail.

The  ISTP/IACG CDAW  relied heavily on computer workstations   and  xterms
provided by NSSDC and SDAC. These resources were available only on temporary
basis  and we appreciate the fact that neither NSSDC nor SDAC can
provide these resources on a longer term basis.  Since the scientific community
is interested in continuing this effort  and has found it to be very beneficial
and scientifically productive, the Center for Solar Physics and Space Weather
(CSPSW) has undertaken to maintain the data base, update it and make it
available to the scientific community without taxing the resources at SDAC and
NSSDC.  The CSPSW can also provide low level data analysis facilities for those
scientists who do not have software tools in their home institutions.

Judging by the community response to the  ISTP/IACG CDAW, the solar
physics/space weather community would find this data base useful as an on going
resource.  Furthermore,  we hope that this  effort will act as a catalyst for a
focussed community effort that is bound to result in enhanced scientific return.
