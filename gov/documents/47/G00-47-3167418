   Jim Gonsior
   District Conservationist
   Lower Elkhorn NRD

     1974 -- Received Bachelor of Science Degree in Natural Resources and
   Soil Conservation from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
   I grew up and worked on a family farm in Central Nebraska. I have 24
   years of experience working with the SCS/NRCS in various locations in
   Nebraska. I have worked as a Soil Conservationist, Resource
   Conservationist, Nebraska Whole Farm Ranch Planning Coordinator, and
   presently District Conservationist at Stanton, Nebraska.
   Resource Needs and Concerns
   The primary resource concerns as identified by the LENRD and local work
   group are:
     * Conserve Soil
     * Flood Control and Prevention
     * Stormwater Drainage Improvement
     * Conserve Groundwater Quantity and Quality
     * Develop and Manage Surface Water
     * Establish and Preserve Fish and Wildlife Habitat
     * Provide Recreation
     * Promote the Planting and Conservation of Trees

   Priorities Address by NRCS
   Excessive Soil Erosion and Surface and Ground Water Protection and
   Management are currently some of the primary priorities identified by
   the local entities. The NRCS in the LENRD can directly contribute to
   the protection and enhancement of the identified resources. By using a
   variety of federal, state, and local programs, cost-share incentives
   can be obtained and planning/application assistance can be provided.
   Primary Programs and Services
   CRP, NSWCP, NRD, EQIP, WRP, WHIP, Pheasants Forever, and Nebraska Games
   and Parks are the major suppliers of cost-share funding for
   conservation programs in the area. Technical assistance for planning
   and program implementation is provided by NRCS with assistance from our
   partners, the LENRD, NG&P, NFS, USF&WS, and the COE.
