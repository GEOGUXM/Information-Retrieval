  Ancient Life of New York - A Billion Years of Earth History

   July 14, 2001 - March 31, 2002
   Exhibition Hall
   life.jpg - 9450 Bytes

   Many of the life forms culled from the State Museum's exhaustive fossil
   collection will be unfamiliar to most anyone who views them at this
   exhibition, curated by the Museum's paleontologists. That is because
   the youngest of the specimens dates back 100 million years, when
   dinosaurs were in their heyday.

   The most ancient of the fossils, from blue-green bacteria found in
   shallow seas located in what are now the Adirondacks, are more than one
   billion-years-old. New York State, in fact, has the oldest animal
   fossils in the eastern United States. With this exhibition, viewers of
   all ages can get a glimpse of not only how old old can be, but also of
   the massive changes in animal and plant life that take place over
   geologic time.

   Included are tree stumps and spiders from Gilboa, Schoharie County,
   home to 380 million-year-old forests, the world's oldest. Also
   displayed are trilobites, best described as ancient relatives of the
   horseshoe crab, retrieved from muddy seas of Utica, Oneida County 450
   million years ago, and the armored fish that roamed the state's waters
   through the Devonian Period, 420 to 360 million years ago.

   Research staff will be on hand to tell the stories behind the
   long-extinct life forms, and give visitors a chance to handle large
   slabs containing fossils. Other hands-on activities and demonstrations
   are planned.

   In addition to shedding light on life that existed long before most
   people can imagine it, Ancient Life in New York shows the important
   role Albany has played for the last 165 years as a center of North
   American fossil research.

  The High Line

   A City Divided, A City United
   The Construction of Elmira's Railroad Elevations, 1932 - 1937
   May 4, 2001 - February 24, 2002
   Crossroads Gallery

   During the 1920s and 1930s, Elmira was served by four railroads: the
   Pennsylvania; Erie; Delaware, Lackawanna & Western; and Lehigh Valley.
   On the Erie alone, between 60 and 70 passenger and freight trains moved
   through the city each day, blocking over a dozen street crossings. By
   1924, Chemung County had 233 rail intersections with streets and
   highways, and the growing volume of automobile traffic meant these two
   forms of transportation were increasingly in conflict. The solution to
   the grade crossing problem was to elevate the railroads through Elmira
   and construct bridges for motor vehicles to bypass the rails in other
   parts of Chemung County.

   Historic photographs from the New York State Archives follow the
   progress of this monumental Depression-era project. Did the crossing
   elimination project unite Elmira, as local citizens hoped it would?
   Find out how the changes wrought by elevating the rails affected this
   upstate community and still resound to this day.

   This exhibition is organized by the Chemung Valley History Museum.

  Weird and Wonderful Dinosaurs

   Works by Bob Goodnough
   At the Discovery Place
   September 22, 2001 - January 6, 2002

   Artist Bob Goodnough loves dinosaurs and other weird creatures! This
   fall come to the Museum's Discovery Place to visit his friend Dinny the
   Dinosaur and other whimsical creations.

   This acclaimed New York artist, whose work is represented in major
   collections throughout the world, including the Empire State Plaza,
   became interested in dinosaurs many years ago after a visit to the
   dinosaur exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History in New York
   City. Since then he has painted and sculpted dinosaurs in varying
   degrees of abstraction to the delight of young art lovers everywhere.

   While dinosaurs are sometimes depicted as fierce and scary, the
   Goodnough dinosaurs are humorous and good-natured. These wild yet
   well-behaved creatures promise to be a fun-filled family adventure!

  All Along the Erie Canal

   The Pastels of J. Erwin Porter
   Exhibition Hall
   November 17, 2001 - April 17, 2002

   J. Erwin Porter (1903-1981) found inspiration for his artwork "all
   along the Erie Canal." The structures and the landscape along the
   historic route became the subject matter for a traveling exhibition
   that enjoyed a number of venues in the 1960s, including the Smithsonian
   Institution. In over 70 drawings and rubbings, now in the collection of
   the New York State Museum, he captured mid-20th-century scenes along
   the mid-19th century route, scenes which are now considered to be
   historic documents at the dawn of the 21st century. This exhibition
   will present a selection from this body of work.

   Porter was born in Medina, Orleans County, and resided in Penfield,
   Monroe County. A graduate of the Rochester Institute of Technology, he
   was a free-lance illustrator and the art director of several
   advertising agencies during his career, working in New York City and
   Rochester. Upon retirement in 1960, Porter began his ambitious series
   of Erie Canal scenes. "I knew I had found my mission," he said. "As
   time passed and my collection of pastels increased, instead of becoming
   bored, my enthusiasm for this historical subject enlarged."

  FLEET GREAT ART SERIES

   Meaning, Medium, and Method: Selections from the Whitney Museum of
   American Art: Works from the 1940s and 50s
   December 8, 2001 - February 24, 2002

   In the newly realized machine age after World War II, sculptors began
   to turn away from traditional methods of execution such as casting and
   direct carving and the use of time-honored materials such as plaster,
   wood, bronze, and stone. Working with metal and industrial materials
   became increasingly popular after the war, when they were readily
   available. The work produced during these years was uniquely
   American-it not only echoed the sentiments of the era in which it was
   produced, but established a firm beginning for modern sculpture as it
   continued to advance in 20th-century America. Organized by the Whitney
   Museum of American Art, the exhibition includes approximately 40 works
   from its permanent collection, including those by William Baziotes,
   Louise Bourgeois, Alexander Calder, and Isamu Noguchi.

  A Slave Ship Speaks: The Wreck of the Henrietta Marie

   December 16, 2001 - March 17, 2002
   Collections Gallery
   Teacher Resource Guide (1,278 kb)

   A Slave Ship Speaks: The Wreck of the Henrietta Marie is the first
   major traveling exhibition devoted to the transatlantic slave trade, as
   told though the 1972 discovery of the Henrietta Marie, the most
   complete slave ship ever to be discovered in the Western Hemisphere and
   the only one to be fully identified, recorded, and archaeologically
   examined and preserved.

   A Slave Ship Speaks: The Wreck of the Henrietta Marie examines the
   economic and social forces that drove the slave trade and provides
   insight into its impact on the material life and culture of Europe,
   Africa, and the Americas-an impact that continues to resonate to this
   day. The exhibition uses the artifacts and ship's records as a means
   for entering the daily lives of the Africans on board the ship as they
   made the journey to the New World as slaves; the seamen who manned the
   ship and managed its human cargo; and the traders who ran this
   notorious enterprise and integrated it into the economy of England.

   The exhibition is organized and circulated by the Mel Fisher Maritime
   Heritage Society, Key West, Florida.
