   Library and Vector Information:

   We array oligo dT-primed, directionally cloned plasmid cDNA libraries
   as part of several public EST projects
   , including clones from human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, Xenopus and
   primate libraries. Corresponding vector information can be found here.
   You can also use our Library Navigator to get information on selected
   libraries using species, tissue and/or library name. Select species of
   interest to begin: [Human_____________] Go

   Mouse clones receive MGI
   IDs along with I.M.A.G.E. cloneIDs. All sequences are promptly
   deposited in dbEST.

   Rearrayed clone sets:

   The I.M.A.G.E. Consortium has rearrayed selected sets of clones, many
   of which are being sequence-verified for highest quality. Please
   contact any of our authorized distributors
   for information on obtaining these rearrays.

   The rearrayed sets that are currently available include:

   MGC predicted full-length: These human and mouse clones have been
   computationally predicted to be full-length based on homology with
   known genes, and several other methods of prediction for novel genes.
   In 384-well format, the IRAK rearray contains ampicillin-resistant
   clones and the IRAL rearray contains chloramphenicol-resistant clones.
   Each plate contains clones from multiple libraries, but from one
   species and one vector only. These clones are being sequence-verified
   and fully sequenced. To access the full-length sequences, search
   Genbank (not dbEST) using the following format: "MGC:MGC_id" to return
   individual sequences or MGC [kywd] for all sequences. Please use the
   I.M.A.G.E. cloneID to order; it can be found in the FEATURES field of
   the Genbank entry.
   Data for each plate in this rearray as well as a cumulative plate file
   (IRAK_IRAL_cumulative.date) can be found on the anonymous ftp site at
   ftp://image.llnl.gov/image/rearrayed_plates.
   Status: ongoing

   MGC verified full-length: This is a subset of the IRAK/IRAL MGC
   predicted full-length set; these clones have been sequence-verified to
   match the EST already in dbEST, and have been fully sequenced to high
   accuracy (full-length sequences are submitted to the primate division
   of Genbank, NOT dbEST). This rearray is in 96-well format, with each
   plate containing clones from one species and vector only. Rearray names
   are IRAT (human, ampicillin-resistant vectors), IRAU (human,
   chloramphenicol-resistant vectors) and IRAV (mouse,
   ampicillin-resistant vectors). Periodic updates will be made as more
   full-length sequences are submitted. To access the full-length
   sequences, search Genbank (not dbEST) using the following format:
   "MGC:MGC_id" to return individual sequences or MGC [kywd] for all
   sequences. The I.M.A.G.E. cloneID can be found in the FEATURES field of
   the Genbank entry.
   A cumulative data file giving plate locations
   (IRAT_IRAU_IRAV_cumulative.date) can be found on the anonymous ftp site
   at ftp://image.llnl.gov/image/rearrayed_plates.
   Additional datafiles, including fasta files of all full-length
   sequences, can be found at the MGC website.
   Status: ongoing

   Mouse genes (lymphochip): This set of 13K unique mouse genes has been
   rearrayed in 96-well format (rearray name IRAP) and is currently being
   replicated for distribution. Sequence-verification is also planned. All
   clones are in ampicillin-resistant vectors, and each plate contains one
   vector only.
   A flatfile containing all the data (IRAP.preSV.data) can be found on
   the anonymous ftp site at
   ftp://image.llnl.gov/image/rearrayed_plates/IRAP.preSV.data.
   Status: rearray complete, no sequence verification

   The following rearrays are currently under construction:

   Human genes (glioma-related): This set of 5500 mostly unique human
   genes (rearray name IRAX) has been rearrayed in 96-well format and is
   currently being replicated for distribution. Each plate contains one
   vector only.
   A flatfile containing all the data (IRAX.preSV.data) can be found on
   the anonymous ftp site at
   ftp://image.llnl.gov/image/rearrayed_plates/IRAX.preSV.data.
   Status: rearray complete, no sequence verification

   Human genes (lymphochip): This set of 2500 known human genes (1415
   unique genes, 1100 of them represented by two independent clones) has
   been rearrayed in 96-well format and is currently being replicated for
   distribution. Each plate contains one vector only. IRAY is a
   non-redundant rearray of ampicillin-resistant clones, IRAZ is a
   non-redundant rearray of chloramphenicol-resistant clones, IRBA is a
   non-redundant rearray of ampicillin-resistant clones that completely
   overlaps the genes represented in IRAY, and IRBB is a non-redundant
   rearray of chloramphenicol-resistant clones that completely overlaps
   the genes represented in IRAZ.
   A flatfile containing all the data (IRAY_IRAZ_IRBA_IRBB.preSV.data) can
   be found on the anonymous ftp site at
   ftp://image.llnl.gov/image/rearrayed_plates/IRAY_IRAZ_IRBA_IRBB.preSV.d
   ata.
   Status: rearray complete, no sequence verification

   Unique human genes: This set of 6K unique human genes consists of known
   genes not currently represented in the MGC full-length set.

   The I.M.A.G.E. Consortium can provide custom arraying and rearraying
   services for public EST projects; please contact image@image.llnl.gov
   to discuss details.

   Additional Resources and Services:

   These primers
   were used by Washington University's Genome Sequencing Center to
   sequence I.M.A.G.E. clones.

   Mapping information produced by The International RH Mapping Consortium
   is now available for more than 30,000 human genes and ESTs (many from
   I.M.A.G.E.) as part of GeneMap'98
   .

   Brigham and Women's Hospital maintains a database containing mapping
   and other information for clones derived from the Morton fetal cochlea
   library.

   Clones and associated products (such as high-density hybridization
   filters, PCR products, and rearrayed sets of clones) are available from
   our authorized distributors
   .

   We have begun maintaining a list of clones that have been
   sequence-verified, with the data coming from several different groups.
   Washington University has resequenced and verified roughly 70,000 ESTs
   from mouse clones and has submitted these new entries to dbEST. More
   specific details can be found at their mouse EST project webpage. We
   also obtain some sequence verification information from our
   distributors, from groups involved in the MGC full-length sequencing
   project, and from our own internal quality control effort. The full
   list of sequence-verified clones, from all of these sources, can be
   accessed from our ftp site at
   ftp://image.llnl.gov/image/clones_verified.

   Hybridization data consisting of some di- and tri-nucleotide repeat
   positive cDNAs
   from the Soares 1NIB library is available.

   The Teacher's Lounge
   contains online resources for teaching genetics and human genomics.
