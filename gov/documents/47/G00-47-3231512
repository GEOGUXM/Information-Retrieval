               ... Spotter Training 2002 Getting Underway ...

   Spotter training classes are conducted every year, mainly from late
   winter through spring.  Classes focus on safely observing and reporting
   severe or hazardous weather, including tornadoes, thunderstorms, flash
   floods, and winter weather.  The program features numerous photos and
   video clips from the midwest, and most are from the local area.

   All classes are conducted by meteorologists from our office.  They are
   FREE, and last about 2 hours.  We try to conduct at least one class in
   each county in our area of responsibility. Please visit our spotter
   training calendar to find a class near you. (New to the calendar this
   year, we've added a "one stop shopping" comprehensive list of all the
   scheduled classes.)

   If you are an Emergency Manager or other local official and would like
   to schedule a class, please contact Jim.

                ... New Climate Normals are Now in Effect ...

   Climate normals are recalculated every 10 years, based on data from the
   previous 30 years.  New normals based on data from 1971-2000 went into
   effect on January 1, 2002. Please see this Information Statement for
   details on the new normals.  Also, it may take a few days to update
   this web site with all of the daily new normals for all of the
   stations.  For the next few days, please use the normals on this web
   site with caution.

   If you are interested in the nitty-gritty on how the normals are
   calculated, visit http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/normals.html
