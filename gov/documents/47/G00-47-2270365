   Jan 21, 2001 Grants New Markets Venture Capital Program

   Low-income communities in the United States face multiple and varied
   barriers to sustainable growth. A common obstacle for virtually all
   such communities is that they are unable to attract sufficient equity
   capital and technical assistance for starting and expanding businesses.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has observed that equity
   capital is crucial to the existence of an innovative and productive
   business community, especially in lower-income areas. Yet such
   communities do not have access to private equity-type capital.

   In December 2000, to address the unmet equity needs of low-income
   communities, Congress passed into law legislation creating the New
   Markets Venture Capital (NMVC) Program. Congress also appropriated
   FY2001 funding of $150 million for debenture guarantees and $30 million
   for operational assistance grants to supplement the private capital
   that is raised by NMVC companies. The U.S. Small Business
   Administration (SBA) will administer the program.
