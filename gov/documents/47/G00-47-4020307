   Large System Acquisition Tool
   __________________________________________________

   Project Description: For years the acquisition community and the
   security community have struggled to come together in a fashion that
   would result in successful procurement of very large systems with
   appropriate security properties. A major issue has often been that the
   security engineers designed and articulated their design using their
   own paradigm and language while the acquisition community procured
   systems and components using a different paradigm and language. Only at
   the very highest level of reference has the procurement paradigm and
   security community language come together to ensure the acquisition of
   secure systems. Even at this highest level of specification, most
   procurement strategies have been based on product level specification
   without consideration of the security properties of the system as a
   whole. This project will attempt to address these problems by offering
   a generalized paradigm for security properties to be articulated at
   acquisition time while laying the groundwork for security engineering
   to be performed as part of the lifecycle development of the system.

   Project Objectives: The objective of this project is to use research
   conducted at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the area of
   secure acquisition and attempt to generalize it for application by
   Federal agencies. Specifically, it involves taking FAA work that
   produced a Common Criteria (CC) protection profile template that merged
   the security and acquisition paradigms in a manner that produced an
   acquisition friendly approach to procuring very large systems with
   appropriate security mechanisms. This project will create a generalized
   PP template and vet the concept with appropriate acquisition officials
   in the U.S. Government. If accepted by the community, an automated tool
   will be designed to streamline its application.
