                                 REMARKS FOR

                       THE HONORABLE NORMAN Y. MINETA

                         SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION

                MARITIME ENERGY AND CLEAN EMISSIONS WORKSHOP

                              WASHINGTON, D.C.

                          TUESDAY, JANUARY 29, 2002

                                  8:30 a.m.


   Thank you, Captain Schubert, and the Maritime Administration, for
   inviting me to address this distinguished international audience.   I
   also want to thank my colleagues at the Department of Energy,  and the
   Environmental Protection Agency, for their assistance and support of
   this event.

   I am pleased to note that so many representatives from the private and
   public sectors from around the United States and abroad are
   participating in this two-day workshop.

   Indeed, it is a testament to the recognition, world-wide, of the need
   for a concerted, immediate joint approach to effecting and implementing
   a plan to operate our vessels and port facilities more profitably,
   while protecting the atmosphere of the communities they serve.

   These next two days provide an opportunity to examine ways and means of
   achieving a more effective marine transportation system that will be
   both efficient and environmentally friendly.

   All of us here now face the twin challenges of becoming more energy
   efficient while reducing air emissions in the maritime industry.

   This problem is not a new one.

   Almost a half century ago, the United States determined that toxic air
   emissions from trucks and automobiles were a serious problem in many of
   the major cities around the country.

   In a cooperative venture with auto and truck manufacturers, air
   pollution reductions of 95 percent have been achieved over the last
   three decades, while we increased energy efficiency by 37 percent.

   Similar initiatives were launched in the operation of the nations
   railroads with similar positive results.

   Now the spotlight is on all of us in the maritime sector.

   Annually, ferries in the United States carry more than 134 million
   passengers, and ships move more than 95 percent of our overseas trade
   through our ports.  Overall, the United States has 25,000 miles of
   navigable waterways.

   And while seagoing vessels account for only 5 percent of all
   transportation-related air pollution, the marine sector, relative to
   other modes of transportation, has not kept pace in reducing harmful
   air emissions.

   This factor provides the driving force behind the recent concerted
   efforts, worldwide, to regulate and reduce toxic air emissions from
   marine operations.

   So, Im pleased to note that the Department, through the efforts of the
   Maritime Administration, has served as a catalyst to bring about this
   two-day workshop to highlight the experiences of other industries and
   other governments that have already been dealing with these issues with
   beneficial results.

   All of us can learn a lot from them on how to map out a strategy to get
   where we need to go.

   This morning, you will hear from some of our port cities that have or
   are beginning to struggle with this challenge.  Later today, you will
   have the opportunity to hear from the Association of American Railroads
   and the American Trucking Association on their experiences and
   initiatives in tackling these issues.

   Additionally, representatives from the governments of Canada, the
   European Union, and Norway will outline the joint approaches they have
   taken with industry to meet these twin challenges.

   I encourage you to take advantage of these and other opportunities over
   the next two days to hear what other modes and other regions are doing
   to combat the issues of energy efficiency and emissions control.

   By these remarks, I dont mean to imply that nothing positive has been
   undertaken to date in the maritime industry.

   In fact, much initial progress has been made in examining ways of
   making marine vehicles and port operations more efficient and with
   lower levels of air polluting emissions.

   We at DOT have been working with our co-sponsors, other federal
   agencies, the private sector, and academia in partnerships to research
   how existing and new technologies can help the maritime community get
   ahead of the energy efficiency curve, and reduce emissions.

   Those initiatives address such things as:   more efficient engines,
   alternative fuels, fuel additives, and fuel cells.

   For example, tests are underway to examine bio-diesel fuel aboard a
   ferry in San Francisco.  And with the Department of Energy and the
   United States Navy, we are conducting additional laboratory tests with
   bio-diesel fuel.

   Additionally, there are programs to examine the use of hydrogen as a
   fuel for marine vessels and port equipment, along with the ability of
   fuel cells to operate in the marine environment.

   As you are probably aware, President Bush has committed this
   Administration to exploring all possible uses of fuel cell technology.

   We are also in the very early stages of exploring with the Department
   of Energy the use of fuel cell technology on the ferries that serve the
   Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbor.  We believe that with fuel cells
   these ferries would generate zero emissions, yet efficiently serve
   hundreds of thousands of visitors to that hallowed monument every year.

   It is certainly true that these and other efforts by all of us in
   government, and by our partners in academia and private industry, will
   be costly and time-consuming.  The rewards, however, will be important
   to us all.

   I look forward to working with all of you in this effort.

   The maritime community rallied to help us meet the security challenges
   following the September 11 terrorist attacks.  I am confident that I
   can rely on you to work cooperatively with us once again.

   In closing, my best wishes for a successful two-day workshop and thank
   you again for allowing me to speak to you today.
