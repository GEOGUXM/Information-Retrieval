NIST Net Home Page

   This is the NIST Net home page. NIST Net is a network emulation package
   that runs on Linux. NIST Net allows a single Linux PC set up as a
   router to emulate a wide variety of network conditions. Here is a brief
   blurb about NIST Net:

     The NIST Net network emulator is a general-purpose tool for
     emulating performance dynamics in IP networks. The tool is designed
     to allow controlled, reproducible experiments with network
     performance sensitive/adaptive applications and control protocols in
     a simple laboratory setting. By operating at the IP level, NIST Net
     can emulate the critical end-to-end performance characteristics
     imposed by various wide area network situations (e.g., congestion
     loss) or by various underlying subnetwork technologies (e.g.,
     asymmetric bandwidth situations of xDSL and cable modems).

     NIST Net is implemented as a kernel module extension to the Linux
     operating system and an X Window System-based user interface
     application. In use, the tool allows an inexpensive PC-based router
     to emulate numerous complex performance scenarios, including:
     tunable packet delay distributions, congestion and background loss,
     bandwidth limitation, and packet reordering / duplication. The X
     interface allows the user to select and monitor specific traffic
     streams passing through the router and to apply selected performance
     "effects" to the IP packets of the stream. In addition to the
     interactive interface, NIST Net can be driven by traces produced
     from measurements of actual network conditions. NIST Net also
     provides support for user defined packet handlers to be added to the
     system. Examples of the use of such packet handlers include: time
     stamping / data collection, interception and diversion of selected
     flows, generation of protocol responses from emulated clients.

   Note: NIST Net is basically beta level code, except when it is alpha!
   It has undergone an amount of testing, but I am sure various bugs or
   misfeatures still remain. The documentation is still a little sparse as
   well.

  NIST Net News

     * New! 14 March 2001 - 2.0.10 released. This one overhauls the
       library and statistics routines, adds some support for other
       protocols, and fixes various bugs. (Note: as usual, there was a
       "prerelease" on the 13th which had some minor problems. If you got
       that one, I'd suggest downloading again.)
     * 9 February 2001 - 2.0.9 released. This one fixes compile bugs for
       2.2.18 kernels, plus a few other miscellaneous changes.
     * 31 January 2001 - 2.0.8 released. Major overhaul, using the
       real-time clock as the timer source, making NIST Net entirely
       modular - i.e., no kernel patches required! Various other
       convenience updates as well. (Note: there was an abortive 2.0.7
       release, which unfortunately was missing a crucial line in
       flush_fast_timer_list().)
     * 19 October 2000 - 2.0.6 released. This merely fixes an install
       problem on Red Hat systems. If you didn't have install problems
       with 2.0.5, you don't have to bother with this one.
     * 16 October 2000 - 2.0.5 officially released! (Note: if you got the
       Friday the 13th prerelease, I'd suggest getting it again - the
       prerelease had a couple of flubs.) Click here for install and
       download
     * 3 May 2000 - 2.0a rev 4 released. A minor update.
     * 27 April 2000 - 2.0a rev 3 released. This fixes a number of bugs
       and misfeatures with the X user interface and library. Every alpha
       user should move to this release.
     * 17 April 2000 - 2.0a rev 2 released. This fixes a bug with CoS
       bits.
     * 12 April 2000 - 2.0a rev 1 released. This one now should install on
       both 2.0.xx kernels (2.0.27-2.0.38) and 2.2.xx kernels (2.2.5 -
       2.2.14).
     * 11 April 2000 - All the new releases are out, albeit in pretty raw
       form. Expect a little rockiness, as I get the install stuff
       straightened out a little bit. The details:
          + Version 1.3bis - stable version for 2.0.xx kernels - released
            22 March, click here to download (Small install bug fixed 31
            March; fetch again if you had install problems with the
            earlier one.)
          + Version 1.4a - alpha version for 2.0.xx kernels - released 31
            March. Note: this one has now been merged into the 2.0a
            release
          + Version 2.0a - alpha version for 2.2.xx kernels - released 11
            April.
     * New! 11 April 2000 - The alpha bug list is open for business (and
       already looks a bit too busy, hmm....)
     * 22 March 2000 New versions are rolling out!
          + Version 1.3bis - bug fix update to version 1.3, otherwise
            identical
          + Version 1.4 - entire revamp of the basic emulator code:
              1. New selection code (taken from NIST Switch) allows
                 emulator packet selection based on source and/or
                 destination IP address, port, protocol, and CoS/ToS bits.
                 Any or all of these may be wildcarded; the emulator picks
                 the best matching entry. (The matching done is controlled
                 through an array of bitmasks which may be set as
                 desired.)
              2. New emulator table structure (also from NIST Switch)
                 allows for truly enormous numbers (tens of thousands) of
                 emulator points.
              3. New statistical code allows setting linear correlation
                 between successive delay, drop, or duplication events.
                 This allows for more realistic modeling of actual
                 observed delays, packet loss, and so on.
              4. New statistical tools allow you to extract the
                 distribution and statistical properties of experimentally
                 observed values (e.g., a series of observed delay values)
                 and insert these into the emulator. This is a fairly
                 simple method for getting the emulator to reproduce
                 "real" network conditions.
              5. Revamped user interface gets rid of a lot of the old
                 Athena text widget annoyances.
          + Version 2.0 - straight port of the 1.4 code to the 2.2.xx
            Linux kernel stream (as found in Red Hat 6 or Slackware 7, for
            example).
       What's the schedule? Um, well...
          + Version 1.3bis is released
          + Version 1.4 alpha (i.e., highly buggy!) to be released by this
            Friday (24 March) (may slip until Monday)
          + Version 2.0 alpha alpha [sic] to be released by next Friday
            (31 March).
       More news later, after I emerge from the next two weeks of fun.
     * 4 June 1998 - New version (1.3) with the following features:
          + Support for (the router part of) explicit congestion
            notification, as in draft-shivkuma-ecn-diffserv-00.txt and
            draft-kksjf-ecn-00.txt
          + Fixes to (finally) compile and install properly on RedHat 5.0
          + Timer improvements
          + User interface improvements
          + Various other bug fixes
     * 30 Jan 1998 - Here is a patch to enable compilation against glibc
       2.0.6. (Patch is superseded by new release.)
     * 14 Jan 1998 - initial beta release
