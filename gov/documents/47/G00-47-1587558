   To search enter a single word, several words or a phrase in quotes.
   Punctuation marks and special characters (period, comma, #,@, ?, !
   etc.) can not be searched for.

   Use Quotation Marks when searching for an exact phrase. Without
   quotation marks, the search command will locate pages where the
   individual words in the phrase appear, as well as pages where the exact
   phrase is used.  Search words and/or phrases should be as specific as
   possible. For example, a search on the word "unemployment" finds 100
   documents, while the phrase "unemployment benefits" finds 28
   documents.)  x
