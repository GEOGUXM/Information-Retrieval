     Announcements




       A. Confidentiality

       Council members are reminded that all materials furnished for review
       purposes and discussions held during the closed portions of the
       meetings are considered privileged information. The contents of those
       documents and the outcome of those discussions during closed sessions
       may be disclosed only by staff, and only under appropriate
       circumstances. All communications from investigators to Council members
       regarding actions on applications must be referred to the Executive
       Secretary. Any attempts by members to handle questions from applicants
       could create difficult or embarrassing situations for the members, the
       Institute, and/or the investigators.

       B. Conflict of Interest Statement Procedures

       Advisors and consultants serving as members of public advisory
       committees may not participate in situations in which any violation of
       conflict of interest laws and regulations may occur. Responsible staff
       shall ensure that a committee member does not participate in and is not
       present during review of applications or projects in which, to the
       members knowledge, any of the following has a financial interest: the
       member, or his or her spouse, minor child, partner (including close
       professional associates), or organization with which the member is
       connected. To ensure that a member does not participate in the
       discussion of, nor vote on, an application in which he/she is in
       conflict, a written certification is required. A statement is provided
       for the signature of the member, and this statement becomes a part of
       the meeting file.

       At Council meetings when applications are reviewed in groups without
       discussion, i.e., "en bloc" actions, all Council members may be present
       and may participate. The vote of an individual member in such instances
       does not apply to applications from any institutions in which the
       member might be in conflict.

       C. State Higher Education Systems or Institutions

       The higher education systems and/or institutions of a state need not
       invariably be joined with the rest of the state governmental structure
       into one organization. Further, if a state has established individual
       institutions, and provides funds separately to them rather than through
       a system, these institutions may be considered to be distinct from each
       other as well as from the rest of the state government.

       D. Multicampus Systems

       The Secretary of HHS has provided a waiver generally permitting
       committee members from one campus of certain multicampus institutions
       to review applications from other campuses of the same institution. I n
       allowing the waiver, the Secretary determined that when committee
       members perform services for the Department and are affiliated with the
       specified multicampus institutions, the members' interests in matters
       affecting campuses other than those where they are employed are too
       inconsequential and too remote to affect the integrity of the services
       performed by those individuals. Thus, peer review advisors from those
       institutions may recommend on matters involving campuses other than
       those where they are employed or have other professional interests.
