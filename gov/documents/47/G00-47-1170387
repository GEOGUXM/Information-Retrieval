   FOR THE RESIDENTS OF GREATER LONG BEACH
   Concerns About Anthrax or Other Biological Hazards

   The City of Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)
   has been receiving a large number of calls from individuals who believe
   they are ill or have been exposed to possible anthrax, smallpox, or
   other biological hazards. In the event of a discovery of a questionable
   substance, fire and police and public health officials will respond to
   investigate the incident. Please note the following:

   1. At this time, there have been NO true anthrax exposures in
   California, despite numerous threats/hoaxes (over 12 events in Long
   Beach alone over the last 5 days have been hoaxes or overreactions to
   normal substances).

   2. At this time, there have been NO cases of anthrax disease or mail
   identified to be contaminated with biological hazards in California.

   3. There is NO recommendation for medical testing or treatment for
   those exposed to a non-credible substance; in the event of a
   documented biological hazard exposure, the DHHS will contact the
   exposed individuals to be tested and to start on antibiotics.

   In the event of an emergency, immediately contact 911. Please note that
   we are entering flu season. If you or members of your family develop
   flu like symptoms, it is much more likely to be the flu or related
   respiratory viruses than anthrax. The general public is at very low
   risk in developing anthrax disease or illness. If you have a condition
   requiring medical attention, please contact your physician. If you do
   not have a physician, please feel free to contact the DHHS at (562)
   570-4000 for a referral. Additional information regarding biological
   hazards may be obtained by visting the DHHS website, at
   www.ci.long-beach.ca.us/health or by calling the DHHS hotline at (562)
   570-4499.
