      The Tarantulas are the music-makers of Henry W. Coe State Park,
      playing jug-band and good-time music from the 1920s to the 1950s
      for events at Coe Park throughout the year.

                         Michael "Spider Mike" Billo
    (dobro, mandolin, saw, and mouth organ)
    Spider Mike traces his roots to long nights spent at San Francisco's
    infamous Coffee and Confusion on upper Grant Avenue, where he learned
    his unique saw-playing style watching John Lee Hooker floss his teeth
    between sets.

   Spider Bob is a former Coe volunteer, currently stationed in San Diego,
   where he is busy mastering blues pennywhistle.  Also a member of the
   folk duo Flatt & Nazell, Bob is proud of his vest, which his sister
   bought for him on Carnaby Street in 1963.

    Spider Bill was first spotted behind a sax, wearing a gold lame

                         David "Spider Dave" Perrin
    (percussion)
    Spider Dave has been a volunteer at Henry Coe since the days when you
    could actually keep horses in the Orestimba Corral.  Specializing on
    washboard, cannon-shell, and hubcap, Dave is alleged to have once
    laundered Joaquin Murietta's long-johns.

    (washtub bass)
    Spider Rosse is a long-time Pine Ridge Association member, and former
    Coe Park Volunteer.  When he's not playing gutbucket for The
    Tarantulas, you might find him at the campfire whipping up a batch of
    his famous five-alarm buffalo lasagna for the rest of the arachnids.
