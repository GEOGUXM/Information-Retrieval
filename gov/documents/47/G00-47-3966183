       Each country listing below contains the latest quarterly report, the
             reconstruction plan, and other items of interest. Country
       Reconstruction Plans in response to Hurricanes Mitch and Georges were
       submitted in the spring and summer of 1999. The documents review the
      extent of the damage caused by the hurricanes, USAID's country plan for
                     reconstruction, and anticipated results.
