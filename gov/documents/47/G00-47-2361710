THE OPAL OPACITY CODE

   The OPAL code was developed at the Lawrence Livermore National
   Laboratory to compute opacities of low- to mid-Z elements. Briefly, the
   calculations are based on a physical picture approach that carries out
   a many-body expansion of the grand canonical partition function. The
   method includes electron degeneracy and the leading quantum diffraction
   term as well as systematic corrections necessary for strongly-coupled
   plasma regimes. The atomic data are obtained from a parametric
   potential method that is fast enough for in-line calculations while
   achieving an accuracy comparable to single configuration Dirac-Fock
   results. The calculations use detailed term accounting; for example,
   the bound-bound transitions are treated in full intermediate or pure LS
   coupling depending on the element. Degeneracy and plasma collective
   effects are included in inverse bremsstrahlung and Thomson scattering.
   Most line broadening is treated with a Voigt profile that accounts for
   Doppler, natural width, electron impacts, and for neutral and singly
   ionized metals broadening by H and He atoms. The exceptions are one-,
   two-, and three-electron systems where linear Stark broadening by the
   ions is included.

Rosseland Mean Opacity Tables

   The monochromatic opacities for a mixture of 21 elements have been
   computed assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium and archived as a
   function of photon frequency on a R-T[6] mesh where T[6] is the
   temperature in millions of degrees, and R=r/T[6]^3 with r the density
   in g/cm^3. The elements included are: H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Na, Mg, Al,
   Si, P, S, Cl, Ar, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni. Although the
   calculations were done for a specific composition, opacities for
   different element abundances can be readily generated from the same
   monochromatic data by the principle of corresponding states.

   It is anticipated that most needs for astrophysical opacities can be
   met with a standard set of tables. Those currently available can be
   obtained by following this link to existing OPAL Opacity Tables.

Equation of State Tables

   Tabulation of thermodynamic variables poses different problems compared
   to opacity. Whereas heavier elements are crucial for the latter,
   elements heavier than O generally play a minor role in astrophysical
   equations of state. Nevertheless, analysis of helioseismic data
   requires highly accurate derivatives of the equation of state. To
   minimize the computer requirements, the astrophysical mixture was
   reduced to H, He, C, O and Ne where the abundance of Ne accounts for
   all heavier elements. More complete calculations were performed to
   verify that only small errors result from the reduced composition.

   The equation of state data is tabulated on a temperature-density grid.
   Three sets of data, along with interpolation codes, are available. The
   EOS and EOSPLUS sets where calculated with an earlier version of the
   OPAL equation of state code. These two sets differ only in the grid
   density; EOSplus has the denser grid. The EOS_2001 set was calculated
   with an improved version of the OPAL code. The main physics differences
   are that the electrons are now treated relativistically and the
   activity expansion method has been improved for repulsive
   inter-particle interactions. The spacing of the EOS_2001
   temperature-density grid is similar to EOSplus, but covers a
   significantly larger range in temperature and density.
