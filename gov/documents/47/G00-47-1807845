      White House Website Privacy Policy
      En Español

      Thank you for visiting the White House Website and reviewing our
      privacy policy. Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect no
      personal information about you when you visit our website unless you
      choose to provide that information to us.
      Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website:

      Information Collected and Stored Automatically

      If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website,
      read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
      information about your visit automatically. This information does not
      identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the
      following information about your visit:
       1. The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a
          private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect
          from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a
          number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
          are surfing the Web) from which you access our website;
       2. The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
       3. The date and time you access our site;
       4. The pages you visit; and
       5. If you linked to the White House website from another website, the
          address of that website.

      We use this information to help us make our site more useful to
      visitors -- to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the
      types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record
   information about individuals and their visits.

   If You Send Us Personal Information

   If you choose to provide us with personal information by sending an
   e-mail to the President or someone else in the White House, or by
   filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it
   through our website, we use that information to respond to your message
   and to help us provide you with information that you request. If you
   submit your resume through our website, we use your personal
   identification information only in considering your application for
   employment. We do not collect personal information for any other
   purposes. The information you provide is not given to any private
   organizations or private persons. The White House does not collect or
   use information for commercial marketing.

   We would share your e-mail with another federal government agency only
   if your inquiry related to that agency or if we were required to do so
   by law. The Presidential Records Act requires us to maintain some
   documents, including e-mails, received by the White House and requires
   public disclosure of some of these documents twelve years after
   President Bush leaves office. In addition, we would release documents,
   including e-mails, if required to do so by a congressional or judicial
   subpoena.

   If you submit resume information through the Presidential Personnel
   Application, this information will be shared only with White House
   employees involved in making hiring decisions and, if you express
   interest in employment with a federal executive agency other than the
   White House, with officials responsible for making hiring decisions in
   that agency. We are required by the Presidential Records Act to
   maintain your resume as a record, but your personal resume information
   is not subject to public disclosure under the Act.

   Links to Other Sites

   Our website has links to the websites of many other federal agencies.
   In a few cases, we link to private organizations, with their
   permission. Before leaving the White House website, a page will appear
   informing you that you are leaving our server. Once you link to another
   site, you are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.
