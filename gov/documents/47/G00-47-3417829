What lies beneath Lake Tahoe?

   The Lake Tahoe Bathymetry Mapping Project is a collaborative effort
   between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Water Resources, National
   Mapping, and Geologic programs. A bathymetric survey of Lake Tahoe was
   conducted on August 1998 using the latest-generation multibeam system
   by the footer image. USGS Western Region Coastal and Marine Geology
   Branch in cooperation with the footer image. Ocean Mapping Group (OMG)
   of the University of New Brunswick, Canada.

   The bathymetry survey of Lake Tahoe is a special project conducted to
   study the terrain of the lake floor. The multibeam mapping system
   records both the bathymetric data (depth information) and the
   backscatter data (the strength of sound energy that bounces back). This
   information can help scientists identify the materials that make up the
   lake floor, such as rock, sand, or mud. New data can shed light on the
   history hidden by the waters of Lake Tahoe.
