                         Office of Crime Victims Advocacy

   Summary

      The Office of Crime Victims Advocacy (OCVA) provides advice to local
      and state governments on practices and policies that impact crime
      victims and provides funding, training, and consultation to help
      communities develop programs to serve crime victims. This activity also
      includes advocacy for victims who encounter difficulty accessing
      services or who believe their statutory or constitutional rights have
      been denied. Additional activities include notification and assistance
      to victims whose offender has the potential for parole under sentences
      prior to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.

   Detail

      OCVA was established in 1990 in response to public input and
      recommendations from a Governor-appointed task force examining
      community protection from sex offenders. Crime victims and advocates
      spoke to the need for coordinated, state level representation and
      funding for sexual assault victims in particular, as well as crime
      victims in general.

      OCVA staff provide individual and system advocacy for crime victims.
      Individual victims may receive information, referral, assistance in
      accessing benefits or services for crime victims, and advocacy to
      support their constitutional rights. Systems serving crime victims
      benefit from OCVA's representation of their interests at the state
      level. Those interests include laws, policies, and funding that impact
      the development or enhancement of victim services at the community
      level.

      OCVA has a leadership role in facilitating training and service
      delivery information that assures communities are providing the best
      possible service. These efforts are implemented through the
      establishment and maintenance of a resource database, a library of
      resource materials, annual conferences and training, a quarterly
      newsletter, and a statewide guide to crime victim services, by county.

      OCVA's philosophy is that it is in the best interest of all citizens of
      Washington State that victims of crime are provided the opportunities
      and resources necessary to recover and return to being productive,
      contributing members of the community. It is essential that state
      government support the development and availability of needed resources
      and opportunities for crime victims
