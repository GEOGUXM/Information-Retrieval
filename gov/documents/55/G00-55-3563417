     The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), formerly the Soil
     Conservation Service, is the federal government agency that works
     hand-in-hand with the American people to conserve natural resources
     on private lands. Using our scientific and technical expertise, and
     our partnerships with conservation districts and others, we help
     people conserve all natural resources on private lands.
