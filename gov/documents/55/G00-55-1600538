   A National Weather Service FY2000 Outreach Action

   Plan, November 10, 1999 A-1

   1. Purpose. This chapter establishes policy for the National Weather
   Service (NWS) Outreach Program. The goals of the program are increased
   customer and partner:

    Response to warnings and critical weather events.

    Preparation for extreme weather events.

    Knowledge and support for the NWS.

    Feedback on services and requirements.

   2. Background. Outreach is a responsibility of all NWS employees. The
   NWS is a customer-oriented and a performance-based organization.
   Reaching out to our customers and partners enables us to develop the
   services our citizens expect. Headquarters, regions, National Centers,
   and field offices are responsible for developing outreach programs
   which help customers and partners provide feedback toward improved
   products and services.

   Outreach consists of the following elements:

    Public awareness and preparedness;

    Constituency building;

    Public and partner feedback;

    Partner technical education;

    Expand public knowledge of weather, water and climate for
   recruitment.

   Attachment A contains the Annual Outreach Action Plan. The plan
   provides a framework for the organization to conduct outreach, minimize
   duplication, share resources and provide universal outreach materials.
   The plan contains sections for each of the above elements as well as a
   section on national outreach campaigns.

   A new annual plan shall be created by the Office of Meteorology (OM)
   each fiscal year. The plan shall take into account recommendations to
   make outreach more effective. Customer and partner feedback promotes
   requirement development for enhanced services. The annual plan shall
   account for activities conducted in the Warning Coordination and Hazard
   Awareness Program, Weather Service Operations Manual (WSOM) Chapter
   C-49, and Service Evaluation Program, WSOM Chapter A-63.

   3. Organizational Responsibilities.

   3.1 Weather Service Headquarters (WSH). WSH, through OM, Customer
   Service Core, manages the program; coordinates activities across
   Headquarters, NCEP and regional offices; ensures a consistent message;
   creates an annual action plan; documents annual accomplishments; and
   conducts outreach activities with national customers and partners.

   3.2 Regional Headquarters Responsibility. Regions are responsible for
   implementing outreach policy and for coordinating outreach activities
   in their region. Regional Headquarters shall report on their
   significant outreach accomplishments as indicated in the Annual
   Outreach Action Plan.

   3.3 Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and Other Field Offices. The WFO is
   the center for most NWS outreach activities. The WFO Warning
   Coordination Meteorologist (WCM), working with the Service Hydrologist,
   is the focal point for the WFO outreach program. NWS Center Weather
   Service Units (CWSUs) and River Forecast Centers (RFCs) shall also
   conduct outreach activities in coordination with their nearest WFO.
   Each CWSU and RFC shall designate a focal point for outreach. WFOs,
   CWSUs and RFCs shall provide their Regional Headquarters with
   significant accomplishments according to reporting requirements
   outlined by their Regional Headquarters.

   3.4 National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The National
   Centers shall conduct customer and partner outreach activities. NCEP
   outreach shall include NWS field offices. These activities will assist
   NCEP in meeting field requirements and in educating the field on how to
   use NCEP products and services. Each NCEP Center shall designate a
   focal point for outreach activities. NCEP shall report on their
   significant outreach accomplishments as indicated in the Annual
   Outreach Action Plan.

   4. Reporting Requirements. The Annual Outreach Action Plan outlines
   specific activities to be completed each quarter along with the lead
   office responsible for the action. WSH offices, regional offices, and
   NCEP shall submit reports on their accomplishments to Headquarters
   according to the process established for the NWS Annual Operating Plan.

   National Weather Service

   FY2000

   Outreach Action Plan

   November 10, 1999

   National Weather Service (NWS) products and services are driven by
   customer and partner requirements. The NOAA Strategic Plan and the NWS
   Strategic Plan provides the guidance for our Outreach Program. Outreach
   is a critical aspect for every NWS employee. The Outreach Action Plan
   provides focus and consistency for NWS outreach efforts.

   The goal of this plan is to achieve the following results:

   Increased public responsiveness to warnings and critical weather events

   Better customer and partner preparation for extreme weather events

   Develop and strengthen existing partnerships

   Increase customer feedback to enhance our services.

   This three-part plan is divided into a listing of FY00 actions, a
   breakdown of sub-tasks for each FY00 priority action, and new outreach
   activities for FY01. All actions identify responsible offices and
   deliverable dates.

   No plan can cover the myriad of outreach activities our offices are
   involved in. This plan highlights the emphasis areas for the year and
   provides guidance on expected activities in each of the five outreach
   elements:

   1. Public Awareness and Preparedness

   2. Constituency Building

   3. Public and Partner Feedback

   4. Partner Technical Education

   5. Expand Public Knowledge of Weather, Water, Climate for Recruitment.

   Unless specific offices are identified, field offices should balance
   the guidance given in this plan with their own unique issues to create
   outreach activities which make the most sense for their local area.
