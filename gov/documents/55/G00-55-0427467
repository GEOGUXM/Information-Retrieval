           [meteor_storm-t.gif] The November Leonids: Will They Roar?

   Each November when the Earth runs into the dusty debris from periodic
   comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle, some Leonid meteor shower activity is noted.
   These annual displays of meteors, or shooting stars, seem to originate
   in the constellation Leo (the Lion) so they are termed Leonid meteors.
   Normally, the observed rate of the Leonid meteors is about 15 per hour
   under ideal observing conditions. However, every 33 years or so when
   the parent comet Tempel-Tuttle returns to the Earth's neighborhood,
   there is a possibility that the Leonid meteors rates can get
   substantially higher. In some years such as 1799, 1833, and 1966, when
   the Earth passed particularly close to the stream of debris following
   in the comet's wake, there were Leonid meteor "storms" noted of up to
   150,000 meteors per hour. Periodic comet Tempel-Tuttle passed closest
   to the sun (reached perihelion) most recently on Feb. 28, 1998 and a
   month later on March 5, the comet passed through the plane of the
   Earth's orbit about the sun.

   Another way of saying the same thing is to note that the comet passed
   through the ecliptic plane from north to south or it passed through its
   descending node. We can expect the maximum Leonid meteor shower
   activity when the Earth arrives close to this nodal crossing point. The
   peak Leonid meteor shower activity normally takes place within a few
   hours of this nodal crossing. In November 1998, there was a meteor rate
   peak at the expected time of 19:43 hours UT but there was an even
   stronger peak more than 16 hours earlier.

   Table 1. Predicted Leonid Shower Circumstances.
   The following table provides information on the past Leonid displays
   and predictions for future displays. The times noted can be considered
   the time at Greenwich England. Times on the east coast of the US would
   be 5 hours earlier for example. Meteor shower rates are often expressed
   in terms of the so-called zenith hourly rate (ZHR) or the hourly rate
   of meteors an observer would witness under ideal conditions with the
   meteors appearing directly overhead (at the zenith). The predicted
   shower times and rates in 2000, 2001, and 2002 are those provided by
   David Asher and Rob McNaught. This table is meant only as a rough guide
   to the upcoming Leonid events.

   If the predictions in Table 1 are correct, the 2001 Leonid visual
   displays will be impressive. The predicted meteor rates are relatively
   high and the moon will be nearly new. In mid-November, the
   constellation of Leo rises above the eastern horizon just after
   midnight local time so that the best time to try to observe the 2001
   Leonids would be in the early morning hours of November 18, 2001.
