   Connection to the National Standards
   Modeling the Sun
   K-4- Develop an understanding of objects in the sky
   Develop an understanding of changes in Earth and sky
   Develop an understanding of the position and motion of objects.
   Grades 5-8 Develop an understanding of Earth in the solar system
   Develop an understanding of the transfer of energy.
   Connection to the National Mathematics Standards
   Grades K through 4
   Use models, known facts, properties, and relationships to explain their
   thinking
   Use mathematics in other curriculum areas
   Explore estimation strategies
   Construct number meaning through real-world experiences and the use of
   physical materials
   Develop spatial sense
   Make and use estimates of measuring.
   Grades 5 through 8

   spatial
   reasoning and reasoning with proportions and graphs
   Understand and apply ratios, proportions, and percents in a wide
   variety
   of situations
   Represent numerical relationships in one and two-dimensional graphs
   Use computation, estimation, and proportions to solve problems
   Systematically collect, organize, and describe data
   Visualize and represent geometric figures with special attention to
   developing spatial sense.
   Differential Rotation of the Sun
   National Science Education Content Standard A, B, D, E, H:
   Develop abilities necessary to do scientific inquiry
   Develop an understanding of motions and forces
   Develop an understanding of origin and evolution of the Earth system
   Develop understanding about science and technology
   Develop understanding of science as a human endeavor and historical
   perspectives
   Benchmarks for Science Literacy:
   Telescopes collect information from across the entire spectrum of
   electromagnetic waves, space probes send back data from the remote
   parts of the solar system and that increasingly sophisticated
   technology is used to learn about the universe.
   National Mathematics Standards:
   Estimate, make and use measurements to describe and compare phenomena;
   select appropriate units and tools to measure to
   the degree of accuracy required in a particular situation; develop
   formulas
   and procedures for determining measures to solve problems.
   Coronal Mass Ejection Velocity with NIH Image Measuring the Motion of a
   CME Using NIH Image (Grades 9-12)
   National Mathematics Standards
   Understands and applies basic and advanced properties of the concept of
   measurement
   Has a basic understanding of the concept of velocity and how it is
   measured
   Has a basic understanding of the concept of acceleration and how it is
   measured
   Determines precision and accuracy of measurements
   Understands that scale drawings can help one measure distances and
   angles
   that are inconvenient to measure directly.
   National Science Education Standards, Science and Technology
   Understands the nature of scientific knowledge
   Knows that science distinguishes itself from other ways of knowing and
   from their bodies of knowledge through the use of empirical standards,
   logical arguments, and skepticism, as scientists strive for certainty
   of their explanations
   Knows that scientific explanations must meet certain criteria; they
   must be
   consistent with experimental and observational evidence about nature;
   and they must include a logical structure, rules of evidence, openness
   to criticism, reporting methods and procedures, and a commitment to
   making knowledge public
   Knows that because all scientific ideas depend on experimental and
   observational confirmation, all scientific knowledge is, in principle,
   subject to change as new evidence becomes available; in areas where
   data, information, or understanding is incomplete, it is normal for
   scientific ideas to be incomplete,but this is also where the
   opportunity for making advances may be greatest.
   Understands the nature of scientific inquiry
   Designs and conducts scientific investigations by identifying and
   clarifying the question method, controls and variables; organizing and
   displaying data; revising methods and explanations; presenting the
   results; and receiving critical response from others.
   Convection Cells (Grades 9-12)
   Connection to National Science Education Standards
   Understand energy types, sources, and conversions, and their
   relationship to
   heat and temperature
   Know that energy tends to move spontaneously from hotter to cooler
   objects by conduction, convection, or radiation; similarly, any ordered
   state
   tends to spontaneously become less ordered over time.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Sun is a ball of hot gases. By weight, it is 70 percent hydrogen;
   28 percent helium; 1.5 percent carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen; and 0.5
   percent other elements. The Sun's temperature is 10,000 degrees
   Fahrenheit at the surface and 27,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit at the
   center. The average distance from Earth to the sun is 93,000,000 miles.
   Light travels in 8 1/2 minutes from the sun to Earth. The diameter of
   the sun is 870,000 mile: 109 times larger than Earth's. Its volume is
   big enough to hold over 1 million Earths.

   The Sun gives us heat, light, food, and the air that we breathe. It
   powers the atmosphere to give us the wind and rain. Even the coal and
   oil that generate electricity for light and power come from plants and
   animals that lived hundreds of millions of years ago and depended on
   the Sun for life. The sun heats the land, oceans, and air. It
   evaporates water from lakes and oceans. When the water vapor cools, it
   drops as rain or snow, giving us the moisture we need for drinking
   water, and for plants and animals to grow. Green plants use the sun's
   rays to turn carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates. At the same
   time, the plants release oxygen that we use to breathe. The production
   of carbohydrates by green plants is called photosynthesis. The
   carbohydrates that plants form are used by them to grow, and we, in
   turn, use plants for our nourishment. Without the Sun, Earth would be a
   dark, cold, and dead place.

   Wedding Ring

   The final burst of light as the Moon's shadow slides over the sun's
   disk resembles a diamond wedding ring.

   Bailey's Beads

   The bright spots along the edges of the nearly covered Sun are known as
   Bailey's Beads. They are created by the last direct light from the Sun
   shining through valleys in the Moon's mountains.
