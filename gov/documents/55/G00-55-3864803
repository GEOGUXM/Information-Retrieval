   International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS). The authors of the
   study identify several characteristics of science education that are
   unique to Minnesota that explain the state's world-class performance in
   8th grade science. These characteristics include: high expectations for
   all students; focus and coherence in curriculum; alignment fostered by
   the existence of de facto science standards; continuity; and capacity
   within the teaching profession.
