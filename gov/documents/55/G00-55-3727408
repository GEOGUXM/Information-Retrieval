   Wildlife disease scientists from the USGS National Wildlife Health
   Center (NWHC) are utilizing their specialized biological containment
   facilities to provide diagnostic support and research results to
   Federal, State, and local wildlife agencies, as well as to public
   health departments that are utilizing dead wild birds as sentinels for
   detecting the West Nile virus (WNV). Wild bird mortality is an accurate
   indicator of the extent of WNV, and it continues to provide an early
   warning system for the emergence of the virus in new locations. The
   probable dissemination of the virus along migratory corridors offers
   new challenges for both public health and wildlife disease specialists.

   Animated WNV images USGS is working with the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention to learn the current geographic extent of WNV,
   to understand how it moves between birds, mosquitoes, and humans, and
   to predict future movements of the virus. The 3-year study utilizes
   active wild bird surveillance along the Atlantic Flyway, with
   simultaneous collection of mosquitoes, to detect the presence of WNV.
   This system, based on the ubiquitous presence of birds and their
   potential exposure to disease, will indicate the diffusion of pathogens
   across eastern America and provide a mechanism to detect novel
   pathogens in the environment, determine their geographic extent, and
   identify their relationship to the landscape and the environment.

   Scientists in the USGS Geographic Science Branch are providing the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as public health
   agencies, with real time geographic information on land-use and
   land-cover data, roads, and hydrography in areas where the virus is
   active. These data are being used by scientists in the field to
   identify bird and mosquito habitat and to determine the best locations
   for placement of mosquito traps.

   Information from the National West Nile Virus Surveillance System is
   being used to compile and produce graphical displays and animations
   showing the pattern and spread of the virus. An additional analysis is
   being performed to detect clusters of infections and, possibly, the
   geographic origin of the outbreak. Maps documenting West Nile virus
   activity in 2001 are available through the Center for Integrated
   National Disaster Information (CINDI).

   The surveillance system will provide basic information on the geography
   of WNV. The combination of this data with information about landscape
   characteristics and weather conditions, over space and time, will
   provide the foundation for developing spatial analytical and
   forecasting models.
