   Mt. Aetna Cave speleothems      While not as numerous or spectacular as
   caverns in Kentucky, Tennessee, or the Virginias, Maryland's caves are
   interesting and valuable resources. Caves are important habitats for a
   variety of plants and animals, some of which are endangered. Caves are
   often an integral part of the natural drainage system which collects
   and purifies ground water. Other caves are the source of drinking water
   for communities. As cultural resources, many Maryland caves have long
   and interesting histories. They have served as shelters for prehistoric
   populations, sources of minerals for commerce, and even as cold storage
   for dairy products. Some caverns contain fossils remains of ancient sea
   creatures and Ice Age mammals. For a detailed study of Maryland caves,
   see E.S. 3: Caves of Maryland.
         One Maryland cave, Crystal Grottoes in Boonesboro (Washington
   County), is open to the public. Crystal Grottoes is about an hour drive
   from Baltimore and Washington D.C. It is well worth the pleasant drive,
   and there are many other interesting places to see in the vicinity.
   Crystal Grottoes is located at 19821 Shepherdstown Pike, Boonesboro
   (301 432-6336). For more information on Crystal Grottoes see the U.S.
   Show Caves Directory.

   Caves of Maryland, took this photo, which was subsequently edited for
   use as a background.

       At least 53 caves occur in Maryland. Most of these are located in
   western Maryland, in Washington, Allegany, Garrett and Frederick
   Counties. There are no know caves on the Eastern Shore or southern
   Maryland. The reason for this uneven distribution is due primarily to
   two geologic factors: bedrock type and drainage. Caves usually form
   when ground water slowly dissolves slightly soluble minerals in
   limestone and marble. The water flows through the rock because gravity
   forces it along cracks, called joints, in the rock. The limestone
   minerals, mostly calcite and dolomite, dissolve in slightly acidic
   water. Rain water is naturally slightly acid because it absorbs
   atmospheric carbon dioxide to make a very dilute solution of carbonic
   acid. When rain water passes through soil, it can become even more
   acidic by absorbing more carbon dioxide and other organically-derived
   acids. This acidic water then filters down to the limestone bedrock
   where it flows through pores and joints. Over thousands of years, this
   process enlarges the voids and spaces in the limestone, forming caves.
   Maryland's caves occur mostly in limestone and marble. Exposures of
   these rocks are limited to the central and western parts of the state.
   Therefore, most of Maryland's caves are found in those regions. These
   caves are probably less than 10 million years old.

        The landscape that develops over limestone and marble regions is
   often shaped by the same geochemical process that forms caves. Sinking
   streams, sinkholes, and springs are often found in areas underlain by
   limestone. This type of topography is called karst. While visually
   interesting, karst topography can be a potential hazard. Sinkholes can
   develop unexpectedly and rapidly, swallowing up cars, houses and whole
   towns. For more information on karst and karst terrane hazards, see MGS
   Factsheet 11: Foundation Engineering Problems and Hazards in Karst
   Terranes.

        The mild temperatures and high humidities found in most Maryland
   caves are relatively constant throughout the year. This kind of
   environment makes caverns an ideal habitat for many animals. A variety
   of spiders, insects, amphibians, reptiles, fish and mammals make caves
   their seasonal or permanent homes. Salamanders, wood rats and several
   types of bats are particularly attracted to caves. These animals
   currently suffer from loss of habitat in Maryland due to development.
   Caves offer refuge to these creatures when forests and farmland are
   destroyed and surface streams are diverted and polluted. Other animals
   including cave crickets and cave moths live primarily in the
   subterranean world. In the past, aboriginal human populations used
   caves for shelter and religious ceremonies. More recently, some of
   these caves have been mined as a source of metal ores, and nitrates for
   gunpowder. Maryland caves have a rich natural and cultural history that
   requires careful preservation and study.

                                  CAUTION!
         Spelunking, the sport of cave exploring, is a popular hobby. For
     information about caving, see the links below. Do not explore caves
   unless you know what you are doing, and never enter a cave alone. Make
   sure you are accompanied by an experienced caver and you are outfitted
      properly. Many caves require rope work and rappelling skills, and
   explorers need to be in good physical condition. Always ask permission
   from the cave owner to enter a cave . Almost all Maryland caves are on
     private or restricted property. Some caves are expressly closed to
   exploration. Remove nothing from a cave. Failure to follow these rules
   can result in injury, arrest and prosecution, and death. For instance,
     there have been several reports of bad air in at least one Maryland
   cave ( HR3 Information - Testing Cave Air Quality; Cave Rescue, October
    14, 1977). Only an experienced caver, with specific knowledge of this
        cave would recognize the risk of entering this cave. For more
   information about caves, see MGS's newly reissued Educational Series 3:
   Caves of Maryland , and the list of educational resources in the table
                                   below.
