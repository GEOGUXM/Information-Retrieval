   About the Tools
   Warning -- Important Notices.
   Most Requested Statistics -- allows users to quickly retrieve BLS time
   series data from lists of those most commonly requested.
   Create Customized Tables (one screen) -- this application (previously
   called "Public Data Query") requires a Java-enabled browser. Choose the
   data you want from BLS databases on a simple, one-screen form.
   Create Customized Tables (multiple screens) -- a form-based query
   application which allows you to obtain BLS timeseries data based on
   choices you make (previously called "Selective Access")
   Flat Files (FTP) -- a link to the BLS FTP server. Given the limitations
   on the amount of data which can be extracted using any of the
   applications provided on the Web site, the FTP server can be ideal for
   those users requiring large volumes of timeseries data.

OTHER TYPES OF DATA ACCESS INCLUDE:

     Economic News Releases -- these news releases present the latest data
   produced by various BLS programs and surveys. News releases are grouped
   according to major BLS statistical categories (for example, Employment
   and Unemployment, Prices and Living Conditions, etc.) for quick
   reference and contain pre-formatted data tables along with text
   explanations provided by BLS economic staff.

     Series Report --this application uses BLS timeseries identifiers as
   input in extracting data from each survey-specific database, according
   to a specified set of date ranges and output options. Primarily for use
   by experienced users of BLS timeseries data, this application provides
   the most efficient path for those users who are familiar with the
   format of each survey-specific timeseries identifier and do not require
   any further assistance in formulating a query.

     Economy At a Glance -- tables which contain current data, organized
   by geography and by industry, on the various economic indicators
   produced by BLS.
