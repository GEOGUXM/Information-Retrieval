     [Up] The Reference System
     The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection
     Reference System is an electronic index to many (but not all)
     documents from the JFK Assassination Records Collection in the
     National Archives. The JFK Act of 1992 required agencies that held
     assassination records to record information about these records on
     Record Identification Forms (RIFs) for input into a master database.
     A copy of the RIF is also attached to each document. All of the
     records described are open for viewing and reproduction, but ARE NOT
     AVAILABLE ON LINE.

     Some documents in the database are still under review by certain
     agencies or have been postponed from disclosure. This information is
     noted in the RESTRICTIONS field or the CURRENT STATUS field of the
     RIF. Updates to the system are made as agencies complete their
     reviews and transfer newly opened records to NARA. The database was
     last updated on December 23, 1998, and currently contains 178,422
     records.

     Not all the material found in the Collection is indexed in the
     database. Material that was open for research on October 26, 1992,
     the day the JFK Act was signed, and was in the custody of the
     National Archives, did not have to be entered into the database.
     Most notably, most of the materials gathered by the President's
     Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy (commonly
     called the Warren Commission) have not been separately indexed.
     Additionally, documents received from private donors outside of the
     Federal government are not described in the database. Finding Aids
     describe records not in the JFK Database.
     [Up] Notice
     Users should be aware, this database is a compilation of entries
     input by the originating agencies. Although the National Archives
     and Records Administration provided guidelines for data entry, the
     master database is inconsistent in the terms used to describe
     records. Please keep this in mind when planning your database
     searches.
