              Welcome to our home page!
   Thank you for stopping by to visit our home page. I hope that the
   information contained within this site will be useful to you. If it's
   not, or if you have some suggestions on how we can make it better,
   please let us know.
   At the Natural Resources Conservation Service we are guided by an
   enduring vision of a nation where the use of resources is governed by a
   widely shared and deeply felt
   stewardship ethic.
   Our vision, as articulated by the first SCS chief, Hugh Hammond
   Bennett, is a nation where "every acre is used according to its
   capability and protected according to its needs." Like Bennett, we
   believe that good management of soil, water, and other natural
   resources will make possible a more abundant life for the people of
   Utah and the nation, both urban and rural, now and for all time.
   Again, thank you for your interest in conservation and in the Natural
   Resources Conservation Service.
   Sincerely,
   Phillip J. "Skip" Nelson

   Our Leader In Action Conservation Day
