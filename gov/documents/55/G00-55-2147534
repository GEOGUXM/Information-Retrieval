   Bio

      William E. Johnston is a Senior Scientist and head of the Distributed
      Systems Dept. in the National Energy Research Scientific Computing
      Division of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and project manager
      for the Information Power Grid at NASA Ames Research Center
      (www.ipg.nasa.gov).

      Research interests include high-speed, widely distributed,
      computational and data "Grids" and wide area network-based distributed
      systems; Public-Key security architectures and authorization systems,
      and; use of the global Internet to enable remote access to scientific,
      analytical, and medical instrumentation. Other professional activities
      include Principal Investigator for several US Dept. of Energy, Office
      of Energy Research and DARPA projects related to these topics, and
      executive committee co-chair for the Global Grid Forum
      (www.gridforum.org).

      Mr. Johnston has worked in the computing field for more than 30 years,
      and has taught computer science at the under graduate and graduate
      levels. He has an M.A. in Mathematics and Physics from San Francisco
      State University. He may be reached at wejohnston@lbl.gov.
