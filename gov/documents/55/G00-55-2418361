   Paleontology

   In the San Francisco Bay Region Project, paleontologists and geologists
   work closely to produce accurate geologic maps. Paleontologists provide
   critical age, stratigraphic, ecologic data about the rocks and the
   environments in which they formed.

   The age of a rock is determined by the use of index fossils which have
   a short, well-known time of existence. Similarly, the environment is
   determined by the use of organisms or charateristics which indicate
   specific environments such as the desert, forest, lake, or marine.
   Paleontologists must continually study fossils from a variety of times
   and environments to build a complete picture of the earth's history.

   Age and ecological interpretations are based on analysis of single or
   multiple fossil groups such as calcareous nannoplankton,
   silicoflagellates, diatoms, radiolarians, foraminifers, and mollusks,
   which are geologicallt short-lived or inhabit specific environments.

   In addition to age and environment, paleontologists can determine the
   geologic history of an area including movement of faults (active and
   inactive), erosion or deposition, glacial activity, and the presence of
   fresh or marine water.

   These activities are useful in geologic mapping, recognition of
   geologic hazards, the search for petroleum and minerals, identification
   of environmental quality and ecosystems, and understanding of global
   change and its impact on life.
