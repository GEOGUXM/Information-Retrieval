   Research Interests:

   Channels and transporters are two major classes of integral membrane
   proteins that mediate regulated passages of ions and solutes across
   biomembranes. Our research focus is to determine structures of
   representative channel and transporter proteins in order to elucidate
   the chemical basis of transmembrane active processes. X-ray
   crystallography is the tool of structural determination, and the
   cornerstone on which we will build our research program on two fronts.
   Theoretically, we will formulate theories to describe dynamics and
   energetics of transmembrane movements of ions and solutes. Practically,
   we will carry out structure-based drug design targeting disorders of
   transmembrane functions. Towards these ends, we are developing a
   general approach for crystallization of integral membrane proteins
   using multidisciplinary techniques of Protein Chemistry, Molecular
   biology and Membrane Biophysics.

   Dax Fu holds a joint appointment as an Assistant Professor in the
   Department of Pharmacological Science at the State University of New
   York at Stony Brook. He will participate in the teaching program with a
   focus on topic related to protein crystallization, structural biology
   and rational drug design.

   Three glycerol molecules define a transmembrane pathway through GlpF, a
   glycerol-conducting channel of E. coli. This integral membrane protein
   was crystallized in detergent micelles, and solved to 2.2Ã… resolution
   by MIR phasing. [GlpF_channel.jpg]
