   Birth Certificates

   We have birth records dating from July 1, 1907. If you are in
   Washington state and the birth certificate you are requesting is in the
   range of 1954 to present, you may contact your local county health
   department. Most of the county health departments are linked into the
   CHS database and can issue birth certificates state-wide 1954 to
   present. Some of the counties have same-day service. You must contact
   the local health department in your area to find out the issuing
   procedure, turnaround time, and hours of operation. Directions to some
   local health departments/districts.
