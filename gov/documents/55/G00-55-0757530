Introduction to using Consed on the Bldg6 server

   Consed is a graphical interface for Phred and Phrap which align
   sequences and aid in the editing of ABI trace files. For a brief review
   of Consed and info on its use read the Consed manual

   For greater detail on all the programs in the suit read the linked
   manuals: Consed, Phrap and Cross_Match, Phred, Swat, phd2fasta, Swat
   Cross_Match.

   If you are interested in using Consed for sequencing projects you must
   first request setup and access to Consed by e-mailing
   tuckerm@ba.ars.usda.gov. The use of Consed may be limited until an
   extended agreement has been approved by the Univ. of Washington.

   Each time you start a new project you will need to make a copy of the
   format directory tree. For example, cp -R format (new project name).
   This will create three directories (chromat_dir, edit_dir, phd_dir) and
   a vector.seq file (you may want to add vectors to this file in a fasta
   format) inside the the new project name directory. Put all your ABI
   trace file into the chromat_dir directory. Move to the edit_dir (i.e.,
   cd ~/Consed/(project name)/edit_dir). Once inside edit_dir type
   phredPhrap to run the perl script that creates the alignments and .ace
   file needed by the consed viewer. Once completed, run Consed by typing
   consed_sgi while still in the edit_dir directory. If you haven't used
   the expected naming for your sequence trace files (see consed manual)
   you will get an error message, but it will still work. Click on the
   contig that you wish to view. To view the trace, place the cursor in
   the sequence you want to view the trace for and then click the middle
   key (may be the left arrow on X-windows emulations). The darker the
   gray, the lower the confidence scor for that base. For more detail read
   through the brief tour in the Consed manual.
