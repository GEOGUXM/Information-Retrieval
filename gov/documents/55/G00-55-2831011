   OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE LA 200, John Adams Building, 110 Second Street,
   S.E. Washington, D.C. 20540-1999 CHARLES A. HUGHES, III, )
   Appellant/Employee, )) v. ) Case No. 98-SN-56 (RP) ) THE OFFICE OF THE
   UNITED STATES ) SENATE SERGEANT AT ARMS, ) Appellee/Employer. )) Before
   the Board of Directors: Glen D. Nager, Chair; Virginia A. Seitz,
   Member. DECISION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Appellant, Charles A.
   Hughes, III (Hughes), appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer
   dismissing his complaint for failure to comply with the time
   requirements of section 402(a) of the Congressional Accountability Act
   (CAA or Act), 2 U.S.C. § 1402(a). The Board concludes that Hughes
   failed to comply with the time limits in the Act and that the Hearing
   Officer did not abuse her discretion when she denied him equitable
   tolling of those time limits. The Board thus affirms the judgment of
   the Hearing Officer. I. a. According to Hughes, the facts are as
   follows: Hughes worked for almost 28 years in the Senate Services
   Department, a print shop/bindery, within the Office of the Senate
   Sergeant at Arms (SSA). Sworn Statement of Charles A. Hughes (April 21,
   1999) (Statement) at ¶ ¶ 2, 3. Hughes alleges that, on several
   occasions, he complained to SSA management, human resources personnel,
   and congressional offices about his Department's mismanagement, illegal
   acts, and unsafe working conditions, including violations of the
   OSHAct, as made applicable by the CAA. Transcript (tr.) at 20-21, 27,
   50, 51; Statement at ¶ 3. As a result, he asserts, on October 2, 1997,
   he was suspended without cause; on October 20, 1997, he was removed
   from his job as night shift supervisor and isolated in a day job
   without duties; and on November 12, 1997, he was officially notified
   that he would be terminated, effective December 19, 1997, and therefore
   took retirement. Statement at ¶ 3. Hughes acknowledges that he had a
   general familiarity with the CAA and the Office of Compliance (Office).
   He had received a memorandum about the CAA in 1995 and had been mailed
   brochures about the Office. He saved some of these materials in case he
   needed them, but did not read them in detail. Tr. at 46-47; Statement
   at ¶ 4. In addition, Hughes had experience in filing workplace
   grievances through other channels. Tr. at 27, 50-52, 57-58. Hughes had
   taken seminars in labor and employment law provided for SSA
   supervisors, tr. at 54, but he had declined to attend a seminar on the
   CAA because it was scheduled outside of his normal work hours, tr. at
   45. Hughes claims that, in October 1997, fearing that he was about to
   be fired, he telephoned the Office to "get a brief idea of what they
   were set up to do" and was told that he should speak to an Office
   counselor. Tr. at 21. He met with a counselor on or about October 20,
   1997 for about 45 minutes. Statement at ¶ 6. According to Hughes, he
   told the counselor that he needed help and that he thought that he was
   about to be terminated. Id. He brought documentation of his complaints
   of workplace violations and described incidents which he believed
   constituted, inter alia, safety violations and illegal discrimination.
   Tr. at 23. The counselor allegedly told Hughes that he had "a weak
   discrimination case," tr. at 27, 45; and that there was nothing that
   the Office could do for him, tr. at 31; Statement at ¶ 6. The counselor
   tried several times to explain to Hughes what he considered
   technicalities about the Act, which he did not understand. Tr. at 30,
   31, 45. The counselor gave Hughes a copy of the Procedural Rules of the
   Office (Procedural Rules or Rules). Tr. at 36. Hughes kept this copy of
   the Rules, but did not read it until more than a year later. See tr. at
   41, 53. Hughes does not recall the counselor explaining how to make a
   formal request for counseling; describing the processes and time limits
   for counseling and mediation; providing him with a form to file
   requesting formal counseling; or otherwise inquiring whether he wished
   to initiate the counseling process. Tr. at 31; Statement at ¶ 6. Hughes
   alleges that approximately two weeks later he spoke to the counselor
   briefly by telephone to arrange to pick up the materials he had left
   with her. Tr. at 32-34; Statement at ¶ 8. He maintains that he told her
   that he had additional reason to believe that he was about to be fired.
   Tr. at 32-33; Statement ¶ 8. Hughes came to the Office about ten days
   later and the counselor handed him his papers, again stating that he
   had a weak discrimination case. Tr. at 33- 34. She did not provide him
   with additional information about his rights under the CAA or the
   Office's processes. Tr. at 34; Statement at ¶ 8. On November 12, 1997,
   Hughes received notice that he would be terminated. Nonetheless, he had
   no further contact with the Office for over a year. He did not inform
   the Office of his forced retirement or inquire further about counseling
   or mediation. Tr. at 42. During the intervening period, he consulted by
   telephone or in person with approximately a dozen attorneys, taking
   with him to meetings the copy of the Procedural Rules that the
   counselor had given him. Tr. at 36; Statement at ¶ 9. But Hughes
   asserts that he did not read the Rules during that period and did not
   learn about the time limits for making claims under the Act until he
   met with his present attorney on or about November 18, 1998. See tr. at
   41. Apparently at the suggestion of his present attorney, Hughes met
   again with the Office counselor on November 24, 1998. Tr. at 38;
   Statement at ¶ 9. At that meeting, Hughes was given and filled out a
   form entitled, "Formal Request for Counseling." Statement at ¶ 11.
   Hughes was also given another copy of the Procedural Rules. Hughes and
   the counselor 2 reviewed a memorandum that Hughes' attorney had
   prepared describing Hughes' previous contact with her. Statement at ¶
   10. The counselor took issue with the memorandum's characterization of
   their prior meeting as formal counseling, stating, according to Hughes,
   "you didn't make a claim; it was up to you and you didn't make a
   claim." Tr. at 38. Hughes avers that, if the counselor had given him
   the counseling request form at his first meeting with her, he would
   have completed the paperwork "just to get the help." Tr. at 39. On
   November 27, 1998, the Office mailed Hughes a Notification of End of
   Counseling Period," by certified mail, return receipt requested. Office
   Of Compliance Certification (April 2, 1999) (Certification) at ¶ 2.
   Hughes acknowledged receipt on November 30, 1998 and requested
   mediation on December 1, 1998. Id. at ¶ 2-3. Hughes testified that he
   read the Procedural Rules for the first time as he was preparing for
   mediation. Tr. at 41. Hughes received a Notification of the End of
   Mediation on January 5, 1999. Id. at ¶ 4. When mediation failed, Hughes
   filed a complaint with the Office. I. b. In his complaint, Hughes
   alleged that the SSA violated section 207(a) of the CAA, ("Prohibition
   Of Intimidation Or Reprisal"), 2 U.S.C.§ 1317(a), by forcing him to
   retire in reprisal for his complaints about violations of the OSHAct,
   as made applicable by the CAA. The SSA moved to dismiss the complaint
   on the ground that Hughes had failed to request counseling within 180
   days after the date of the alleged violation, as required by section
   402(a) of the Act, 2 U.S.C. § 1402(a). After considering the pleadings,
   Hughes' sworn statement and testimony, and the briefs and argument of
   counsel, the Hearing Officer granted the motion and dismissed the
   complaint with prejudice. Memorandum of Decision and Order Dismissing
   the Complaint, (Decision) No.98-SN-56 (RP) (May 3, 1999) at 1. The
   Hearing Officer concluded that Hughes did not comply with the time
   requirements of the Act because more than 180 days had elapsed between
   the events giving rise to his retirement on December 19, 1997, and his
   November 24, 1998 request for counseling. Id. at ¶ 1.b. She found that,
   despite his timely initial contact with the Office on October 20, 1997,
   Hughes failed to "follow through on counseling, mediation, and
   procedures outlined in the material given to him." Id. at ¶ 1.c. The
   Hearing Officer rejected Hughes' argument that the October 20, 1997
   meeting with the counselor was a request for counseling as contemplated
   by section 402(a) of the Act. Id. at ¶ 2. Rather, she found that "he
   came to the Office of Compliance seeking advice . . . . and left
   feeling discouraged about the `technicalities' of the Act." Id. at ¶ 2.
   b. She further concluded that Hughes "did not behave as if he had
   initiated a counseling process." Id. at ¶ 2. c. She pointed out that,
   by his own admission, Hughes had failed to read the written materials
   the counselor had given him or to contact the Office, except to pick up
   his documents, for over a year after his initial October 1997 meeting:
   "He did not notify the Office that he wished to pursue any matters
   which he had discussed on October 20, 1997 until he filed a request for
   counseling on 3 November 24, 1998." Id. The Hearing Officer also
   concluded that there was no legal or equitable basis for tolling the
   limitations periods in the Act. Id. at ¶ 3. She found that Hughes was
   educated and capable of comprehending what rights were available to
   him, was generally informed about his rights under the Act, and was
   able to pursue those rights. Id. at ¶ 3. a-c. And she determined that
   the limitations period could not be equitably tolled because "[t]he
   Office of Compliance did not mislead Mr. Hughes or fail in its duties
   to him." Id. at ¶ 3. d. II The Hearing Officer concluded that, even
   assuming the facts asserted by Hughes were true, he had failed to
   satisfy the time requirements of the CAA and that the limitations
   periods in the Act should not be tolled. We must decide whether these
   conclusions are "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse or discretion, or
   otherwise not consistent with law." 2 U.S.C. § 1406(c)(1). To initiate
   a timely proceeding under the CAA, an employee must request counseling
   within 180 days of the alleged violation of the Act. 2 U.S.C. §1402(a).
   The Hearing Officer found, and Hughes acknowledges, that the complaint
   at issue arises from a counseling request that was filed substantially
   more than 180 days after the alleged violations of the Act. On November
   12, 1997, Hughes received official notice that he would be terminated.
   See Statement at ¶ 3. Assuming that to be the date of the violation,
   see Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 258 (1980), Hughes
   had to request counseling by May 11, 1998. This complaint arises from a
   formal request for counseling which Hughes made on November 24, 1998,
   see Certification at ¶ 2 % i.e., 197 days too late.1 Hughes asserts,
   however, that he timely requested counseling under the Act on October
   20, 1997, and that this request should toll the Act's time limits so as
   to make timely the complaint arising out of his November 24, 1998
   request for counseling. In making this assertion, Hughes acknowledges
   that he failed to pursue the mandatory processes of the Act after his
   October 20, 1997 meeting with the counselor. He did not seek mediation
   within fifteen days of the end of the thirty-day counseling period; a
   fortiori, he did not file a complaint with the Office or a civil action
   within ninety days of the end of a mediation period arising out of that
   alleged request for counseling. See 2 U.S.C. §§ 1403, 1404. But he
   attributes his omissions to the Office's failure to provide him with
   the necessary information at the October 20, 1997 meeting with the
   counselor and, on that basis, maintains that he is entitled to
   equitable tolling of the time limit to request counseling for a period
   of close to a year. We find no abuse of discretion in the Hearing
   Officer's conclusion that Hughes is not entitled to toll the time
   limits in the Act for so long a period. 1 The conclusion that the
   counseling request was untimely holds true even if the limitations
   period were deemed to commence running on the date of Hughes'
   retirement, December 19, 1998. 4 Preliminarily, we note that the
   October 20, 1997 date precedes the date of the principal violation of
   the Act alleged by Hughes % his wrongful forced retirement in lieu of
   termination. Thus, Hughes could not at this meeting have initiated
   counseling on his claim that he was unlawfully forced to retire. Hughes
   attempts to avoid this problem by asserting that counseling was
   "ongoing" throughout the thirty-day period and therefore that he was
   still in counseling on November 12, 1997, when the notice of
   termination occurred. This argument is difficult to square with Hughes'
   failure later to inform the counselor that he had in fact been forced
   to retire, especially in light of the Act's clear purpose to ensure
   that parties utilize the Act's mechanisms to adjust their disputes. For
   purposes of decision, however, we will assume without deciding that
   Hughes requested counseling on October 20, 1997; we also assume without
   deciding that Hughes may invoke the doctrine of equitable tolling under
   the Act;2 and we assume without deciding that the Office's alleged
   conduct might support some period of equitable tolling.3 Nonetheless,
   on the facts proffered by Hughes, he is not entitled to equitable
   tolling of the Act's time limits for a period long enough to make
   timely his November 24, 1998 request for counseling, because Hughes
   plainly failed to exercise due diligence to protect his rights during
   the period at issue. Even where a plaintiff has some justification for
   a late filing, he does not receive a limitless extension of the
   applicable limitations period. Rather, it is well established that a
   plaintiff seeking equitable tolling of a limitation period is obligated
   to act with due diligence to protect his or her rights. See Irwin v.
   Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 498 U S. 89, 96 (1990) ("We have generally
   been much less forgiving in receiving late filings where the claimant
   failed to exercise due diligence in preserving his legal rights."),
   citing Baldwin County Welcome Center 2 Equitable tolling is applied
   under some statutes and not others. Compare Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans
   Affairs, 498 U S. 89 (1990) (approving the application of equitable
   tolling against the government in Title VII case) to United States v.
   Brockamp, 519 U.S. 347 (1997) (disapproving the application of
   equitable tolling against the government in tax refund case). 3 Hughes
   assumes that the Office's alleged conduct mandates equitable tolling. A
   plaintiff is not always entitled to equitable tolling simply because he
   or she receives incorrect or incomplete information from a government
   agency employee. See, e.g., Kelly v. Nat'l Labor Relations Board, 79
   F.3d 1238, 1248-49 (1st Cir. 1996) (although agency failed to inform
   employee that regulations placed responsibility on charging party for
   service of process and erroneously instructed her attorney that agency
   would serve process, attorney's reliance on oral advice of low level
   employee was not reasonable in light of clear requirement of written
   regulation); Jarrett v. U.S. Sprint Communications Co., 22 F.3d 256,
   260 (10th Cir. 1994) (district court clerk's office failure to notify
   plaintiff that filing fee must be paid with a specified time
   insufficient to toll statute: "[i]n this circuit, a Title VII time
   limit will be tolled only if there has been active deception of the
   claimant regarding procedural requirements."). 5 v. Brown, 466 U S.
   147, 151 (1984)).4 Thus, the litigant who seeks to rely on equitable
   tolling "must sue as soon after the statute of limitations has expired
   as he obtains the information or would have done so had he been
   reasonably diligent." Wolin v. Smith Barney Inc., 83 F 3d 847, 852 (7th
   Cir. 1996) (emphasis added). See id. at 853 ("in a case of equitable
   tolling the plaintiff must be continuously diligent and sue (if he is
   beyond the statutory period) as soon as it is practicable for him to do
   so.").5 In the circumstances here, we agree with the Hearing Officer
   that it was not reasonable for Hughes to sleep on his claims for close
   to a year. Hughes is well educated and capable. He had a copy of the
   Office's Rules. There, in relatively straightforward language, the
   processes of the Act are explained and the time limits are clearly set
   forth. See Rule § 2.03. The Rules further explain that once the
   employee has formally requested counseling, the employee has the
   responsibility for going forward at all times. See Rule 2.03(k) ("Duty
   to Proceed. An employee who initiates a proceeding under this part
   shall be responsible at all times for proceeding, regardless of whether
   he or she has designated a representative."). Yet, for a period of
   almost a year after his last contact with the Office and after his
   retirement, Hughes failed to make any inquiry whatsoever about his
   case. He did not notify the Office of his notice of termination or
   forced retirement; he did not inquire about further counseling; he did
   not ask about mediation. 4 See also Flight Attendants Against UAL
   Offset (FAAUO) and United Air lines, Inc. v. Comm'r of Internal
   Revenue, 165 F.3d 572, 576 (7th Cir. 1999) ("It is . . .vital that a
   party who wants to appeal to the doctrine of equitable tolling to
   excuse a late filing show . . . that he tried diligently to file within
   the deadline or as soon afterwards as possible."). 5 Equitable tolling
   adjusts the rights of two innocent parties. It is for that reason, in
   part, that the doctrine tolls the limitation period only for the time
   deemed reasonably necessary to act. Cada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.,
   920 F.2d 446, 452 (7th Cir. 1990). Accord Early v. Bankers Life and
   Casualty Co., 959 F.2d 75, 81 (7th Cir. 1992) (assuming that the agency
   gave plaintiff misleading information, the question is whether he filed
   as early as he realistically could given that misinformation); Luckett
   v. Rent-A-Center, 53 F.3d 871, 873 (7th Cir.1995) (denying equitable
   tolling despite the court's failure to notify the plaintiff that her
   suit had been dismissed, because "we do not think that waiting fourteen
   months to hear from the court can be deemed reasonable"); Jarrett, 22
   F.3d at 260 (denying equitable tolling to a pro se litigant who sought
   to pay a filing fee five months after her request for appointment of
   counsel had been denied, even though the clerk's office had failed to
   notify her of the appropriate time limit); Catawba Indian Tribe of
   South Carolina v. United States, 982 F.2d 1564, 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1993)
   (even if ignorance of meaning of law could be grounds for tolling a
   limitations period, once the Tribe should have known of government's
   mistaken interpretation, further equitable tolling was unavailable);
   Demers v. General Dynamics, 779 F.2d 95, 99 (1st Cir. 1985) (no tolling
   when the grievant failed for three years to investigate whether the
   union was prosecuting his claim); Chappell v. Emco Machine Works Co,
   601 F.2d 1295, 1303 (5th Cir. 1979) (no tolling when employee waited
   five months to ask EEOC whether state employment commission employee
   had filed her EEOC complaint). 6 He did not even consult the brochures
   or the Rules in his possession. If, as he states, Hughes believed that
   he was engaged in counseling under the Act, at some reasonable time
   after the thirty-day counseling period, Hughes had a duty to inform the
   Office of his forced retirement or to make an inquiry about proceeding
   further under the Act or to look at the Rules. He failed to do so.6
   Accordingly, even assuming that Hughes initiated counseling on October
   20, 1997, it was not reasonable for him to fail to take any action to
   pursue his claims under the CAA for almost a year. He therefore was not
   entitled to equitable tolling of the time limits in the Act for that
   period. See Luckett, 53 F.3d at 873 (unreasonable delay when plaintiff
   waits 14 months to hear from the court); Jarrett, 22 F.3d at 260
   (failure to pay filing fee within five months unreasonable delay);
   Demers, 779 F.2d at 99 (failure to investigate union prosecution of
   claim for three years unreasonable delay). For these reasons, the
   Hearing Officer's conclusions that Hughes failed to satisfy the time
   limits in the Act and that Hughes was not entitled to equitable tolling
   of those limits were neither unlawful nor an abuse of discretion. 2
   U.S.C. § 1406. The judgment of the Hearing Officer is affirmed. IT IS
   SO ORDERED. 6 Hughes also apparently consulted with numerous lawyers
   about his claim. The failure of the many lawyers that Hughes consulted
   to spot the applicable limitations period does not justify equitable
   tolling. See Blumberg v. HCA Management, 848 F.2d 642, 644 (5th Cir.
   1988) (difficulty in obtaining counsel does not toll period); Stallcop
   v. Kaiser Found. Hosp., 820 F.2d 1044, 1050 (9th Cir. 1987) (no tolling
   where employee "gained the means of knowledge" by consulting three
   attorneys during applicable limitations period). 7
