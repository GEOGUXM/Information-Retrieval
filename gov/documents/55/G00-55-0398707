   Cancellation of the September meeting, and the resulting postponement
   to May 2002 of the scheduled October meeting in Dutchess County,
   requires a change in meeting dates.  Currently the May 2002 meeting
   dates are Wednesday and Thursday, the 22nd and 23rd.

   The dates are being changed to Tuesday and Wednesday, the 21st and
   22nd.
