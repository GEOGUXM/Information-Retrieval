      IMPORTANT ALERT

      This is to alert all Ginnie Mae issuers originating securities for
      settlement on the Federal Reserve's Fed-wire system (currently Ginnie
      Mae II Securities only) to take extra care to insert the proper
      delivery instructions on the form HUD 11705, Schedule of Subscribers
      and Ginnie Mae Guaranty Agreement. Minimum information to be included
      is the Clearing Bank ABA Number and Account Name and/or Number (however
      identified by the Clearing Bank). Required information varies depending
      on the institutions involved. Issuers are strongly encouraged to
      contact their Securities Settlement Department to obtain the required
      information from the appropriate broker/dealer making arrangements for
      the delivery of their securities. Failure to provide the above
      information could result in the delay of settlement of your securities.

      STATUS UPDATE - JANUARY 19, 2002

      As planned, on Saturday, January 19th, 2002, all Ginnie Mae II MBS,
      Ginnie Mae II Platinum as well as Ginnie Mae II REMIC securities with
      payable dates of the 20th and 21st were successfully moved to the
      Federal Reserve. All new issuances of the above security types will
      settle on the Federal Reserve's Fed-wire system. Next scheduled
      conversion weekend is the weekend of February 9th and 10th, 2002. See
      "Conversion Timetable" for more details.

      STATUS UPDATE - JANUARY 9, 2002

      As a reminder, the conversion of Ginnie Mae securities to the Federal
      Reserve will begin the weekend of January 19th and 20th, 2002 and
      concluded the weekend of March 23rd and March 24th, 2002. The weekends
      of April 6th and 7th, 2002 and April 20th and 21st, 2002 have been set
      aside as alternative conversion weekends, if needed.

      By now, you should have received a copy of Ginnie Maes GinnieNET 2020,
      Version 5.5 software. This software must be installed and used by
      program participants no later than January 14, 2002.

      For Ginnie Mae II pools scheduled for settlement from the period
      January 14, 2002 through January 31, 2002, issuers are required to
      include both contra account and clearing bank information on the form
      HUD 11705. Furthermore, for Ginnie Mae I pools scheduled for settlement
      from the period February 1, 2002 through the end of the conversion,
      issuers are required to include both contra account and clearing bank
      information on the form HUD 11705. Failure to follow the above
      procedures could result in delay of settlement of your Ginnie Mae
      pools.

      Account Executive. Thank you for your cooperation in working with
      Ginnie Mae to implement this important initiative that will benefit
