   Jen Anhalt researching swine odors

                      Click here for more information.

   NSRIC Research Technician, Jen Anhalt, is pictured using gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry to characterize odors
   emitted from swine production. Direct multicomponent analysis of VOCs
   emitted from swine production can be applied toward estimating
   perceived odor intensity.
