   RTECS Database

   What is the RTECS® Database: The Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical
   Substances (RTECS®) is a database of toxicological information
   compiled, maintained, and updated by the National Institute for
   Occupational Safety and Health. The program is mandated by the
   Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The original edition, known
   as the "Toxic Substances List," was published on June 28, 1971, and
   included toxicologic data for approximately 5,000 chemicals. Since that
   time, the list has continuously grown and been updated, and its name
   changed to the current title, "Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical
   Substances." RTECS® now contains over 133,000 chemicals as NIOSH strive
   to fulfill the mandate to list "all known toxic substances...and the
   concentrations at which...toxicity is known to occur."

   RTECS® is a compendium of data extracted from the open scientific
   literature. The data are recorded in the format developed by the RTECS®
   staff and arranged in alphabetical order by prime chemical name. No
   attempt has been made to evaluate the studies cited in RTECS®. The user
   has the responsibility of making such assessments.

   Who Should Access the RTECS® Database and Why: Anyone needing toxicity
   data on thousands of known substances. RTECS® provides:
     * Access to toxicity information for over 133,000 chemicals
     * Identification of six types of toxicity data including:
          + primary irritation,
          + mutagenic effects
          + reproductive effects
          + tumorigenic effects
          + acute toxicity
          + other multiple dose toxicity
     * Includes specific numeric toxicity values such as LD50, LC50, TDLo,
       TCLo
     * Identification of species studied and route of administration used
     * Each data line lists the bibliographic source to indicate actual
       studies cited
