     Central Valley Bay Delta Branch (CVBDB) GIS Unit


   Overview

   The Central Valley Bay-Delta Branch (CVBDB) is mandated to conduct
   fisheries and wildlife research and analysis of the San Francisco Bay
   and Delta and special water projects of the estuary and its
   tributaries. These special projects include the channel and aqueduct
   systems of the Delta, as well as, the natural river systems and
   extending north and south from the Delta.
   Mission

   The CVBDB's mission is to gather and provide information and recom-
   mendations that will permit others (such as other units of the DFG and
   other agencies such as the Envi- ronmental Protection Agency (EPA), the
   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
   (USBR), the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), and the
   Depart- ment of Water Resources (DWR) to develop proce- dures, policies
   and regulations that will protect the flora and fauna of the bay, Delta
   and adjoining tributary environments from harm, and that will enhance
   the survival of those species that are endangered.
   These recommendations are made in an atmosphere of competing interests
   for scarce resources from a variety of public and private sources.
   Water and other estuary resources are in demand by rural agriculture,
   cities, anglers, developers, environmentalists, and others. To provide
   a means of resolving demands while protecting species and habitat, a
   variety of federal and state laws, policies and regulations have been
   enacted. Federal and state laws mandate restrictions, and regulations
   relative to listed species, water policies, land development practices
   and other environmental and toxic issues.
