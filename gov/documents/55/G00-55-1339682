   Overview

   The Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative
   Methods (ICCVAM) was established in 1997 by the Director of the
   National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) to
   implement NIEHS directives in Public Law (P.L.) 103-43. This law
   directed NIEHS to develop and validate new test methods, and to
   establish criteria and processes for the validation and regulatory
   acceptance of toxicological testing methods. P. L. 106-545, the ICCVAM
   Authorization Act of 2000, established ICCVAM as a permanent committee.
   The Committee is composed of representatives from 15 Federal regulatory
   and research agencies; these agencies generate, use, or provide
   information from toxicity test methods for risk assessment purposes.
   The Committee coordinates cross-agency issues relating to development,
   validation, acceptance, and national/international harmonization of
   toxicological test methods. A list of the ICCVAM Members is available
   here.
   The National Toxicology Program (NTP) Interagency Center for the
   Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) was
   established in 1998 to provide operational support for ICCVAM, and to
   carry out committee-related activities such as peer reviews and
   workshops for test methods of interest to Federal agencies. NICEATM and
   ICCVAM coordinate the scientific review of the validation status of
   proposed methods and provide recommendations regarding their usefulness
   to appropriate agencies. NICEATM and ICCVAM seek to promote the
   validation and regulatory acceptance of toxicological test methods that
   will enhance the agencies' ability to assess risks and make decisions,
   and methods that will refine, reduce, and/or replace animal use. The
   ultimate goal is the validation and regulatory acceptance of test
   methods that are more predictive of adverse human and ecological
   effects than currently available methods. Such methods are expected to
   support improved protection of human health and the environment.
   The ICCVAM Test Method Evaluation Process
   When adequate information is available for a new test method, peer
   review panels are convened; these panels are composed of expert
   scientists from national and international industry, academia, and
   government. Peer review panels are charged with developing a scientific
   consensus on the validation status of the proposed test method,
   including its usefulness for generating information for specific human
   health and/or ecological risk assessment purposes. Workshops and expert
   panel meetings are convened as needed to evaluate the adequacy of
   current methods for assessing specific toxicities, to identify areas in
   need of improved or new methods, to assess the current validation
   status of methods, and to recommend additional research, development,
   and validation activities. In assessing the validation status of a
   method, panels consider available information for a specific test
   method and evaluate the extent to which the ICCVAM validation and
   acceptance criteria have been addressed. Panel deliberations are
   conducted in public session and the opportunity for public comment is
   provided before and during meetings. Published reports of panel
   evaluations and ICCVAM recommendations regarding scientific validity
   and potential acceptability of test methods are forwarded to agencies
   for their consideration. Each Federal agency then determines the
   regulatory acceptability of a method according to its statutory
   mandates.
   Recent Validation Review Activities
   The Murine Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA), a method for assessing the
   allergic contact dermatitis of chemicals, was reviewed in September
   1998, and the final peer review report was published in February 1999.
   The peer review panel concluded that the LLNA is a valid alternative to
   currently accepted guinea pig test methods, and that the LLNA reduces
   the number of animals required for testing and eliminates animal pain
   and distress. Compared to the traditional test, the LLNA can also be
   completed in a shorter timeframe and provides dose-response
   information. Additional recommendations on the usefulness and
   limitations of the LLNA are provided in the peer review report:
   http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/llnarep.pdf. U.S. EPA, FDA, and OSHA
   announced their acceptance of the LLNA in October 1999. An
   implementation workshop co-sponsored by ICCVAM and the International
   Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) was convened in January 2001. The
   workshop discussed how to conduct the assay and interpret the results
   in order to meet regulatory agency requirements. The LLNA is currently
   being considered as an international test guideline by the 30-member
   countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
   (OECD) in their Test Guidelines Programme
   (http://www.oecd.org/ehs/ehsmono/INDEX.HTM).
   A peer review panel reviewed the validation status of CorrositexÂ®, an
   in vitro method for assessing the dermal corrosivity potential of
   chemicals, in January 1999. The panel concluded that the method could
   be used to assess the corrosivity potential of certain chemical classes
   and could be used in a tiered approach for the testing of additional
   chemical classes. When used in this manner, the method provides for the
   refinement, reduction, and partial replacement of animal use. The final
   peer review report was published in June 1999, and acceptance by
   regulatory agencies was announced in March 2000. The peer review report
   may be requested from NICEATM and is available on the Internet at:
   http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/corprrep.htm. A draft test guideline will
   be proposed to the OECD Test Guidelines Programme in 2001.
   NICEATM and ICCVAM convened an expert panel meeting in May 2000, on
   FETAX, the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay in Xenopus. FETAX is
   proposed as a screening method to evaluate the developmental toxicity
   potential of chemicals. The panel reviewed the current validation
   status and current and potential applications of FETAX. The Panel
   recommended further research and development efforts to improve the
   method's accuracy and reproducibility. Recommendations for validation
   studies to further characterize the usefulness of FETAX were also
   developed. The meeting minutes are available here and the final report
   will be available in 2001.
   A peer review panel meeting to evaluate the validation status of a
   revised Up-and-Down Procedure for acute oral toxicity was held in July
   2000. The Panel endorsed revisions to further reduce the number of
   animals needed to estimate a median lethal dose necessary for hazard
   classification and labeling of chemicals and products. Results of the
   peer review were used to prepare a revised OECD Test Guideline and
   Guidance Document on Acute Toxicity that is expected to be adopted in
   2001. The minutes of the peer review panel meeting can be found on the
   Internet at: http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/udp.htm and a final report
   will be available in mid 2001.
   Recent Workshop
   An ICCVAM/NICEATM International Workshop on In Vitro Methods for
   Assessing Acute Systemic Toxicity was held in October 2000. Workgroups
   evaluated the current validation status of in vitro cytotoxicity
   methods for assessing acute toxicity, in vitro methods for assessing
   metabolism and toxicokinetics, and in vitro methods for assessing organ
   specific toxicity. Another workgroup addressed the development of a
   database of chemicals to be used for in vitro validation studies. The
   workgroups reviewed the status of in vitro methods for assessing
   various endpoints, recommended candidate methods for future evaluation
   and validation, recommended validation study designs, and identified
   priority research necessary to support further development of
   mechanism-based in vitro methods for acute systemic toxicity.
   The workgroup reports and recommendations are expected to be available
   for public distribution in mid 2001. Additional information can be
   found on the Internet at: http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/invitro.htm..
   Future Test Method Activities
   In collaboration with the U.S. EPA, ICCVAM and NICEATM are preparing
   comprehensive background review documents on in vitro screening methods
   to identify chemicals with potential endocrine disrupting effects.
   These documents will be used as the basis for an independent scientific
   peer review evaluation of the methods anticipated for early 2002.
   Two in vitro methods proposed to replace the in vivo Draize corneal
   irritation test (in certain situations) have been submitted to NICEATM
   for consideration. If sufficient data are available, peer reviews of
   the methods will be convened.
   Following completion of validation studies by the European Centre for
   the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), three i in vitro skin
   corrosivity test methods and an in vitro phototoxicity assay were
   recently approved by the European Commission. NICEATM and ICCVAM have
   developed an expedited review process to evaluate these methods and to
   develop recommendations for U.S. regulatory authorities.
   Federal Advisory Committee on Alternative Toxicological Methods (ACATM)
   The Department of Health and Human Services has established an NTP
   Federal Advisory Committee on Alternative Toxicological Methods (ACATM)
   to provide advice on the activities and priorities of NICEATM and
   ICCVAM, and to recommend ways to foster partnership activities and
   productive interactions among all stakeholders. ACATM is composed of
   knowledgeable scientists from academia, industry, public
   interest/animal welfare organizations, and other agencies. ACATM
   typically meets twice yearly, and minutes are available on the Internet
   at: http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/about/acatm.htm.
   Partnerships
   Opportunities for organizations and agencies to partner with NICEATM to
   support the development, validation, and review of new alternative
   testing methods are available. Interested individuals should contact
