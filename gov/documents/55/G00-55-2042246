   The Archives staff provides a range of research services, including
   assistance with locating historical records and answering questions
   related to JPL's projects and activities. Cataloged records are
   available for research use by JPL and NASA personnel, contractors and
   the general public.

   BEACON-Archives, the searchable on-line catalog, contains bibliographic
   information about processed collections that are available for research
   use. Records are inventoried to the document or file folder level, and
   many folder listings, available through the catalog in PDF format, can
   be viewed and searched using Acrobat Reader software. Some Archives
   holdings, including the History Collection, are currently indexed only
   in hard copy format, but will soon be added to the catalog, as will
   oral history interviews. Contact Archives staff for assistance with
   these materials.

   Photocopy reproductions of paper records and reproductions of JPL
   images in a variety of photographic formats are available. Contact the
   Archives staff for current reproduction fees and method of payment.
   Prepayment is required for all orders.
