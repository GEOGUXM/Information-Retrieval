   Help

   The NAS Systems Division web site sports a variety of features to help
   you navigate our pages quickly to pinpoint the content you're looking
   for. Some of these helpful features are reviewed below.

   Navigation
   The NAS home page links to three main areas:
     * About NAS
     * Research & Technology
     * User Services

   You can get directly to the main subsections for these areas from the
   home page. When you go to any of the main areas on the site, notice
   that the navigation choices for that section expand in the menu shown
   on the left. While the other main sections are still accessible, their
   subsections disappear to keep the menu more compact.

   The navigation is consistent on the first three levels of the NAS site,
   and we're slowly but surely bringing remaining levels up to date.

   Search
   Use our new Search tool to explore the entire NAS web site. Click on
   the search button at the bottom right corner of the NAS home page and
   at the top of all other pages.

   Staff Directory
   Get phone numbers and e-mail addresses for NAS staff with our new Staff
   Directory, located at the bottom left corner of the NAS home page and
   at the top of all other pages.

   To find someone who works at Ames Research Center, use the Ames X.500
   Directory Service.

   Sitemap
   For a bird's-eye view of the entire NAS web site, take a look at our
   Sitemap, and then follow the links to get where you want to go. The map
   link is at the bottom right corner of the NAS home page and at the top
   of all other pages.

   User Service Help Desk
   Users with accounts on computers at the NAS Facility can get
   round-the-clock help by sending e-mail to nashelp@nas.nasa.gov or
   calling our 24-hour help desk: 650-604-4444, toll-free 800-331-8737
   (331-USER).

   Designed for Universal Accessibility
   To make the NAS web site universally accessible -- particularly to
   people with disabilities -- a link to a text-based, alphabetical index
   is located in the top left corner of every page (above the NAS logo).
   Text equivalents (in the form of alt attributes) are included for
   logos, photos, graphics, navigation buttons, and submit buttons. Audio
   and video presentations are accompanied by text transcripts and
   descriptions. What's more, we've designed our pages to fit on 8 1/2" by
   11" sheets for printing.

   If All Else FailsÂ…
   If you have trouble accessing anything on our site, call 650-604-4444
   or toll-free 800-331-8737 (331-USER) 24 hours a day for support or send
   e-mail to support@nas.nasa.gov.
