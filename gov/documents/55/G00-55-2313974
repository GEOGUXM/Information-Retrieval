                               What is a trademark?

          A trademark includes any word, name, symbol, or device, or any
      combination, used, or intended to be used, in commerce to identify and
          distinguish the goods of one manufacturer or seller from goods
         manufactured or sold by others, and to indicate the source of the
                   goods. In short, a trademark is a brand name.

                              What is a service mark?

       A service mark is any word, name, symbol, device, or any combination,
      used, or intended to be used, in commerce, to identify and distinguish
       the services of one provider from services provided by others, and to
                       indicate the source of the services.

                           What is a certification mark?

          A certification mark is any word, name, symbol, device, or any
      combination, used, or intended to be used, in commerce with the owners
        permission by someone other than its owner, to certify regional or
         other geographic origin, material, mode of manufacture, quality,
       accuracy, or other characteristics of someone's goods or services, or
         that the work or labor on the goods or services was performed by
                     members of a union or other organization.

                            What is a collective mark?

       A collective mark is a trademark or service mark used, or intended to
      be used, in commerce, by the members of a cooperative, an association,
         or other collective group or organization, including a mark which
      indicates membership in a union, an association, or other organization.

                                                              Basic Questions

                        Do I need to register my trademark?

        No. However, federal registration has several advantages including
        notice to the public of the registrant's claim of ownership of the
       mark, a legal presumption of ownership nationwide, and the exclusive
       right to use the mark on or in connection with the goods or services
                          set forth in the registration.

                              ^ Back to the Contents

             What are the benefits of federal trademark registration?

         1. Constructive notice nationwide of the trademark owner's claim.
                    2. Evidence of ownership of the trademark.
                 3. Jurisdiction of federal courts may be invoked.
       4. Registration can be used as a basis for obtaining registration in
                                foreign countries.
         5. Registration may be filed with U.S. Customs Service to prevent
                     importation of infringing foreign goods.

                              ^ Back to the Contents

         Do I have to be a U.S. citizen to obtain a federal registration?

         No. However, an applicant's citizenship must be set forth in the
          record. If an applicant is not a citizen of any country, then a
         statement to that effect is sufficient. If an applicant has dual
       citizenship, then the applicant must choose which citizenship will be
      printed in the Official Gazette and on the certificate of registration.

        Are there federal regulations governing the use of the designations
                           "TM" or "SM" with trademarks?

       No. Use of the symbols "TM" or "SM" (for trademark and service mark,
        respectively) may, however, be governed by local, state, or foreign
        laws and the laws of the pertinent jurisdiction must be consulted.
       These designations usually indicate that a party claims rights in the
         mark and are often used before a federal registration is issued.

                              ^ Back to the Contents

      When is it proper to use the federal registration symbol (the letter R
                 enclosed within a circle -- ® -- with the mark.

       The federal registration symbol may be used once the mark is actually
        registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Even though an
      application is pending, the registration symbol may not be used before
         the mark has actually become registered. The federal registration
      symbol should only be used on goods or services that are the subject of
       the federal trademark registration. [Note: Several foreign countries
       use the letter R enclosed within a circle to indicate that a mark is
         registered in that country. Use of the symbol by the holder of a
                       foreign registration may be proper.]

                              ^ Back to the Contents

              Do I need an attorney to file a trademark application?

      No, although it may be desirable to employ an attorney who is familiar
         with trademark matters. You may access the trademark forms, plus
        information about applying for a trademark, by clicking Basic Facts
       About Trademarks. The forms may be downloaded, filled out and mailed
        in. Or, by clicking PrinTEAS, you can fill out, validate and print
        trademark and service mark applications via the PTO web site. Many
      applicants find it beneficial to search a mark (to see if there are any
          registered, pending, or previously used marks) before filing a
        trademark application. You can search our trademark database on the
      World-Wide Web at. http://tess.uspto.gov. Word marks (marks consisting
      only of words) may be searched at one of the many Patent and Trademark
      Depository Libraries (PTDLs) located throughout the United States. For
          a listing of these locations, please click here PTDLs. You must
        actually go to the library itself and perform the search yourself.
       However, the Patent and Trademark Depository Librarians are extremely
       helpful in getting you started. Searches can also be performed at the
          Patent and Trademark Office at 2900 Crystal Drive, 2^nd Floor,
      Arlington, Virginia. If you need to locate an attorney specializing in
      trademark law, local bar associations and the Yellow Pages usually have
                   attorney listings broken down by specialties.

                       What constitutes interstate commerce?

        For goods, "Interstate commerce" involves sending the goods across
       state lines with the mark displayed on the goods or the packaging for
        the goods. With services, "interstate commerce" involves offering a
      service to those in another state or rendering a service which affects
        interstate commerce (e.g. restaurants, gas stations, hotels, etc.).

              How do I find out whether a mark is already registered?

          In order to determine whether any person or company is using a
      particular trademark, a trademark search can be conducted. Searches can
          be performed at our offices at 2900 Crystal Drive, 2^nd Floor,
      Arlington, Virginia. Also, word marks may be searched at over 70 Patent
      and Trademark Depository Libraries located throughout the country. For
                 a listing of these locations, please click PTDL.

            Is a federal registration valid outside the United States?

           No. Certain countries, however, do recognize a United States
       registration as a basis for registering the mark in those countries.
        Many countries maintain a register of trademarks. The laws of each
                 country regarding registration must be consulted.

      Is it advisable to conduct a search of the Office records before filing
                                  an application?

       Yes. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) Public Search Library for
        trademarks is located at 2900 Crystal Drive, 2nd Floor, Arlington,
      Virginia 22202. The Public Search Library is open between 8:00 a.m. and
      5:30 p.m. Use of the Public Search Library is free to the public. Also,
           certain information may be searched at a Patent and Trademark
        Depository Library. For locations, click PTDL. These libraries have
         CD-ROMS containing the database of registered and pending marks.
         (However, the CD-ROMS do not contain images of the design marks.)

                 Can the Office conduct a search for an applicant?

       No. After a trademark application is filed, the Patent and Trademark
         Office (PTO) will conduct a search of the records as part of the
       official examination process. The official search is not done for the
       applicant but rather to determine whether the mark applied for can be
        registered. It is advisable to search the records before filing the
          application. A search may be conducted on the World-Wide Web at
         http://tess.uspto.gov, or by visiting the Trademark Public Search
        Library, between 8:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. at 2900 Crystal Drive, 2nd

                            What are common law rights?

           Federal registration is not required to establish rights in a
           trademark. Common law rights arise from actual use of a mark.
      Generally, the first to either use a mark in commerce or file an intent
          to use application with the Patent and Trademark Office has the
          ultimate right to use and registration. However, there are many
                    benefits of federal trademark registration.

       What is a common law search? How can I do one? Is doing a common law
                                 search necessary?

       A common law search involves searching records other than the federal
      register and pending application records. It may involve checking phone
        directories, yellow pages, industrial directories, state trademark
      registers, among others, in an effort to determine if a particular mark
        is used by others when they have not filed for a federal trademark
        registration. A common law search is not necessary but some find it
         beneficial. Telephone numbers for search firms that perform these
        searches for a fee can be found in the yellow pages of local phone
                    directories and through an Internet search.

                              ^ Back to the Contents

      In searching the trademark data base on the Web there are records that
      appear to be a registrations but the registration numbers are shown as
                            0000000. Is this an error?

      No, this is not an error. The registration number 0000000 is associated
       with PTO records that have serial numbers that begin with "89-". The
         prefix "89-" is assigned to material that the PTO is obligated to
       protect either by law or treaty. However, since this material is not
          actually registered under the Trademark Act, it is not issued a
                               registration number.

      There are two types of material that are assigned "89-" serial numbers.
      One type is material that is used by U.S. federal agencies that should
        not be registered as trademarks unless the agencies themselves are
       filing the trademark applications. The second type is material we are
      obligated to protect under various international treaties. The entities
        holding this material may be international organizations or foreign
         governments. These filings are not assigned registration numbers
          because the "89-" materials are not "registered"; they are only
       deposited in the PTO for reference and informational purposes. During
      the PTO examination of pending applications, the "89-" material will be
           referenced as a bar to the registration of a mark undergoing
         examination if it is determined that the mark in the application
      creates a false association with entity holding the "89-" material [15
      U.S.C. 1052(a)] or if the "89-" material is the official flag, coat of

                                           Trademarks, Patents and Copyrights

          How do I find out if I need patent, trademark and/or copyright
                                    protection?

        Patents protect inventions and improvements to existing inventions.
      Copyrights cover literary, artistic, and musical works. Trademarks are
        brand names and/or designs which are applied to products or used in
                             connection with services.

                          How do I register a copyright?

      The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) does not handle the registration
      of copyrights. The Copyright Office is part of the Library of Congress
         (202-707-3000). For more information, click on Copyright Office.

                                                          Application Process

                 How do I obtain a federal trademark registration?

          A registration may be applied for by filing a properly executed
            application with the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). The
       application, and any accompanying communications, should be addressed
         to "Assistant Commissioner for Trademarks, Box New App/Fee, 2900
      Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202-3513." You may access the trademark
        forms, plus information about applying for a trademark, by clicking
       Basic Facts About Trademarks. The forms may be downloaded, filled out
      and mailed in. Or, by clicking PrinTEAS, you can fill out, validate and
        print trademark and service mark applications via the PTO web site.

                           Who may file an application?

          Only the owner of the trademark may file an application for its
      registration. An application filed by a person who is not the owner of
         the mark will be declared void. Generally, the person who uses or
       controls the use of the mark, and controls the nature and quality of
      the goods to which it is affixed, or the services for which it is used,
                             is the owner of the mark.

                              ^ Back to the Contents

           Do I have to use the application form provided by the Office?

         No, but the format used must comply with all Patent and Trademark
         Office (PTO) requirements. The prepared PTO form is provided as a
       convenience. The PTO recommends use of the form to avoid the omission
                             of important information.

              Can a fax copy or photocopy of an application be filed?

      Yes. However, there is no provision for filing an application by means
          of facsimile transmission, i.e., by "faxing" it to the Office.
      Applications, whether originals or copies, must be filed either by hand
       or by mail. A faxed copy can be submitted either by U.S. mail or hand
                                     delivery.

                                What is a specimen?

      A specimen is a real-world example of how the mark is actually used on
      the goods or in the offer of services. Labels, tags, or containers for
         the goods are considered to be acceptable specimens of use for a
        trademark. For a service mark, specimens may be advertising such as
        magazine advertisements or brochures. Actual specimens, rather than
      facsimiles, are preferred. However, if the actual specimens are bulky,
       or larger than 8½" x 11", then the applicant must submit facsimiles,
       (e.g., photographs or good photocopies) of the specimens. Facsimiles
       may not exceed 8½" x 11". ONE SPECIMEN IS REQUIRED FOR EACH CLASS OF
                  GOODS OR SERVICES SPECIFIED IN THE APPLICATION.

      Specimens are required in applications based on actual use in commerce,
      Section 1(a), 15 U.S.C. §1051(a), and must be filed with the Amendment
      to Allege Use, 15 U.S.C. §1051(c) , or the Statement of Use, 15 U.S.C.
       §1051(d), in applications based on a bona fide intention to use the
      mark in commerce, Section 1(b), 15 U.S.C. §1051(b). Specimens are not
      required for applications based on Section 44 of the Trademark Act (for
      owners of foreign trademark applications and registrations), 15 U.S.C.
                                      §1126.

                               What is the drawing?

         The "drawing" is a page which depicts the mark applicant seeks to
         register. In an application based on actual use, Section 1(a), 15
      U.S.C. §1051(a), the drawing must show the mark as it is actually used,
      i.e., as shown by the specimens. In the case of an application based on
       a bona fide intention to use, Section 1(b), 15 U.S.C. §1051(b), the
       drawing must show the mark as the applicant intends to use it. In an
        application based on a foreign application or foreign registration,
      Sections 44(d) or 44(e), 15 U.S.C. §§1126(d) and (e), the drawing must
            depict the mark as it appears or will appear on the foreign
        registration. The applicant cannot register more than one mark in a
      single application. Therefore, the drawing must display only one mark.

                              ^ Back to the Contents

          If an applicant submits specimens, is a drawing still required?

        Yes. A drawing is required in all applications, and is used by the
          Office for several purposes, including printing the mark in the
         Official Gazette, and ultimately, on the registration certificate
       itself. Specimens, on the other hand, are required as evidence that a
                        mark is in actual use in commerce.

                   Do I need an attorney to file my application?

       No, but an applicant is responsible for observing and complying with
       all substantive and procedural issues and requirements whether or not
         represented by an attorney. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO)
      cannot select an attorney for an applicant. The names of attorneys who
      specialize in trademark law may be found in the telephone yellow pages,
                     or by contacting a local bar association.

           On what bases can a foreign applicant file an application for
                                   registration?

        1.  Use in interstate commerce or commerce between the United States
        and a foreign country.
        2.  Bona fide or good faith intention to use the mark in interstate
        commerce or commerce between the United States and a foreign
        country.
        3.  Ownership of an application filed in a foreign country (if
        within six months of the foreign filing date).
        4.  Ownership of a foreign registration (with a certified copy).

                              ^ Back to the Contents

                     Can the Office refuse to register a mark?

      Yes. The Office will refuse to register matter if it does not function
       as a trademark. Not all words, names, symbols or devices function as
      trademarks. For example, matter which is merely the generic name of the
                  goods on which it is used cannot be registered.

      Additionally, Section 2 of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C. §1052) contains
       several of the most common (though not the only) grounds for refusing
      registration. The grounds for refusal under Section 2 may be summarized
                                        as:

        1.  the proposed mark consists of or comprises immoral, deceptive,
        or scandalous matter;
        2.  the proposed mark may disparage or falsely suggest a connection
        with persons (living or dead), institutions, beliefs, or national
        symbols, or bring them into contempt or disrepute;
        3.  the proposed mark consists of or comprises the flag or coat of
        arms, or other insignia of the United States, or of any State or
        municipality, or of any foreign nation;
        4.  the proposed mark consists of or comprises a name, portrait or
        signature identifying a particular living individual, except by that
        individual's written consent; or the name, signature, or portrait of
        a deceased President of the United States during the life of his
        widow, if any, except by the written consent of the widow;
        5.  the proposed mark so resembles a mark already registered in the
        Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) that use of the mark on
        applicant's goods or services are likely to cause confusion,
        mistake, or deception;
        6.  the proposed mark is merely descriptive or deceptively
        misdescriptive of applicant's goods or services;
        7.  the proposed mark is primarily geographically descriptive or
        deceptively geographically misdescriptive of applicant's goods or
        services;
        8.  the proposed mark is primarily merely a surname; and
        9.  matter that, as a whole, is functional.

                 Can I get a refund of monies paid to the Office?

        Not usually. Only money paid by mistake or in excess (that is, paid
      when not required, or not required in the amount paid) may be refunded.
      A filing fee will be returned if submitted with a defective application
      which is denied a filing date. However, once the application receives a
      filing date, the filing fee will normally not be returned. All requests
      for refunds should be referred to the Finance Office, or the Examining
                                Attorney assigned.

      How can I check on the status of a pending U.S. trademark application?

      Once you receive a filing receipt containing the serial number of your
       application, you may check on the status of a pending case by calling
       our status line at (703) 305-8747.  You may also check the status of
       applications and registrations through the Trademark Applications and
      Registrations Retrieval (TARR) database on the Office's World Wide Web
                          site at http://tarr.uspto.gov .

                              ^ Back to the Contents

                How long does it take for a mark to be registered?

      It is difficult to predict how long it will take for an application to
      mature into a registration, because there are so many factors that can
         affect the process. Generally, an applicant will receive a filing
      receipt approximately six months after filing. The filing receipt will
      include the serial number of the application. All future correspondence
        with the PTO must include this serial number. You should receive a
        response from the Office within six to seven months from filing the
      application. However, the total time for an application to be processed
       may be anywhere from almost a year to several years, depending on the
           basis for filing, and the legal issues which may arise in the
      examination of the application. Current status information on trademark
         applications and registrations may be obtained by dialing: (703)
        305-8747, or by accessing Trademark Applications and Registrations
         Retrieval (TARR) database on the Office's World Wide Web site at
      http://tarr.uspto.gov . Applicants should check on the status of their
                      pending applications every six months.

                              ^ Back to the Contents

                   How long does a trademark registration last?

         For a trademark registration to remain valid, an Affidavit of Use
      ("Section 8 Affidavit") must be filed: (1) between the fifth and sixth
      year following registration, and (2) within the year before the end of
       every ten-year period after the date of registration.  The registrant
       may file the affidavit within a grace period of six months after the
        end of the sixth or tenth year, with payment of an additional fee.

      The registrant must also file a §9 renewal application within the year
      before the expiration date of a registration, or within a grace period
      of six months after the expiration date, with payment of an additional
                                       fee.

         Assuming that an affidavit of use is timely filed, registrations
            granted PRIOR to November 16, 1989 have a 20-year term, and
        registrations granted on or after November 16, 1989 have a 10-year
                                       term.

       This is also true for the renewal periods; renewals granted PRIOR to
      November 16, 1989 have a 20-year term, and renewals granted on or after
                      November 16, 1989 have a 10-year term.

                              ^ Back to the Contents

           When did the renewal period change from twenty to ten years?

       November 16, 1989. Registrations issued on or after November 16, 1989
                 have a ten-year term, renewable every ten years.

       How long does an Intent-to-Use applicant have to allege actual use of
                               the mark in commerce?

       An applicant may file an Amendment to Allege Use any time between the
        filing date of the application and the date the Examining Attorney
      approves the mark for publication. If an Amendment to Allege Use is not
      filed, then applicant has six months from the issuance of the Notice of
      Allowance to file a Statement of Use, unless the applicant requests and
      is granted an extension of time. If the applicant fails to file either
      an Amendment to Allege Use or a Statement of Use within the time limits
           allowed, then the application will be declared abandoned. No
                           registration will be granted.
