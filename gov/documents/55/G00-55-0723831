                               Mission Statement

   As described in NOAA Organization Handbook . . .

   The NOAA Civil Rights Office (formerly NOAA Civil Rights Staff) advises
   and assists the Under Secretary in carrying out NOAA's responsibilities
   relative to Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as
   amended; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; the
   Rehabilitation Act of 1973; as well as any other laws, Executive
   Orders, regulatory guidelines affecting affirmative action and
   non-discrimination within the Federal Government; and matters regarding
   equal employment opportunity (EEO) or affirmative action policy
   recommendations, objectives, and progress in meeting goals. The Staff
   processes and adjudicates complaints of discrimination; and plans,
   develops, monitors, and evaluates NOAA-wide Affirmative Employment
   Program plans. It conducts studies on systemic employment problems,
   assesses the effect of policies and practices on equal employment,
   identifies employment barriers, recommends solutions, and develops
   written guidance for management on all of the foregoing. The Staff
   provides advice to all principal Line and Staff Office officials and
   managers concerning all aspects of NOAA's EEO/Civil Rights Program.
