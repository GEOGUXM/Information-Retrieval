   In the FY98 Performance Agreement between The Secretary of Energy and
   the Acting Assistant Secretary for Environment, Safety and Health, the
   Office of Worker Health and Safety committed to "Implement an
   integrated initiative across the DOE Complex to enhance the conduct of
   internal radiation dosimetry programs for the protection of workers."
