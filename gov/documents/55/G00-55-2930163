                  Software Metrics Research and Development

   The objectives of the software metrics program of the SATC encompass
   three areas:
     * Quality Assessment
     * Risk Management and Control
     * Process Improvement

   To accomplish these objectives, the SATC works with project managers
   and developers (both NASA and contractor) to collect measurements and
   develop metrics that assist them in evaluating the quality of the
   products (requirement documents, design documents, code, test plans,
   etc.) and the risks to their projects.

   The SATC has been successful in disseminating results and knowledge
   through paper presentations, technical papers, and tutorials at various
   conferences and workshops. For a complete listing of these
   presentations, papers and tutorials, please reference the SATC Support
   and Outreach page. Text of many of the papers is available on-line.

   NEW The SATC has been collecting code metrics for over 7 years.  SATC
   has  metrics for 7 programming languages, both non-object oriented and
   object-oriented metrics.  Click here to view the SATC Code Metric
