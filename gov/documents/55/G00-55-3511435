   Frequently Asked Questions

   Q: How many federally recognized Indian tribes are there in Washington
   State?

   A: There are 28 federally recognized tribes in Washington State

   Q: What is a Federally recognized tribe?

   A: "Federally recognized," means these tribes and groups have a
   [langdonwalla.jpg] special, legal relationship with the U.S.
   government. This relationship is referred to as a
   government-to-government relationship. Members of Federally recognized
   Tribes who do not reside on their reservations have limited relations
   with the BIA and HIS, since BIA and HIS programs are primarily
   administered for members of Federally recognized tribes who live on or
   near reservations.

   Q: How does one trace Native American ancestry and become a
   member of a tribe?

   Many people think that the BIA retrieves genealogical information from
   a massive national Indian registry or comprehensive computer database.
   This is not true. Most BIA offices, particularly the central
   (headquarters, Washington, DC) and area (field) offices do not keep
   individual Indian records and the BIA does not maintain a national
   registry. The BIA does not conduct genealogical research for the
   public.
   If an individual does not wish to conduct their own research,
   researchers are available for a fee. Please write to the Board of
   Certification of Genealogists or the Association of Professional
   Genealogists and request their listings of genealogical researchers for
   hire. Their addresses are:
   Board of Certification of Genealogists
   P.O. Box 14291
   Washington, D.C. 20044

   The Association of Professional  Genealogists
   P.O. Box 40393
   Denver, Colorado 80204

   Q: How does an Native American become a member of a Tribe?

   [sealioncatch.jpg] A: A Tribe sets up its own membership criteria,
   although the U.S. Congress can also establish tribal membership
   criteria. Becoming a member of a particular Tribe requires meeting its
   membership rules, including adoption. Except for adoption, the amount
   of blood quantum needed varies, with some Tribes requiring only proof
   of descent from an Native American ancestor, while others may require
   as much as one-half.

   Q: What benefits and services are available to federally recognized
   tribe?

   A: The two main federal agencies which provide benefits and services to
   recognized Indian tribes are the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the
   Indian Health Service (HIS). The BIA is a unit of the U.S. Department
   of the Interior and the HIS is a branch of the U.S. Department of
   Health and Human Services (USDHHS). Major benefits and services
   provided by these agencies include, but are not limited to, the
   following: medical and dental care, grants and programs for education,
   housing programs, aid in developing tribal governments and courts,
   resource management, and other services based upon tribal needs and
   interests.

   Q: What does tribal sovereignty mean to Native Americans?

   A: When Indian Tribes first encountered Europeans, they were dealt with
   because of their strength in numbers and were treated as sovereign
   governments with whom treaties were made. When tribes gave up their
   lands to the U.S., the retained certain sovereignty over the lands they
   kept. While such sovereignty is limited today, it is nevertheless
   jealously guarded by the tribes against encroachments by others.

   Q:  Where can I find census information on Native Americans/Alaska
   Natives?

   A: You can access population information at the United States Census
   Bureau's website:  U.S. Census Bureau American Indian and Alaska Native
   Populations
