   CTAS Overview

   The Center TRACON Automation System (CTAS) provides automation tools
   for planning and controlling arrival air traffic. CTAS generates air
   traffic advisories designed to increase fuel efficiency, reduce delays,
   and provide automation assistance to air traffic controllers in
   achieving acceptable aircraft sequencing and separation as well as
   improved airport capacity. CTAS accomplishes this without decreasing
   safety or increasing controller workload.

   Twenty areas approximately 400 miles across make up the airspace of the
   48 contiguous states. These areas, known as Air Route Traffic Control
   Centers (ARTCCs) or ``Centers'' for short, are further divided into
   sectors. CTAS's Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) helps a Center's
   Traffic Management Coordinator (TMC) optimize the arrival traffic flow
   and create a plan. At the same time, CTAS's Descent Advisor (DA)
   assists the air traffic controllers of each sector by probing for and
   resolving conflicts between aircraft, and providing air traffic control
   advisories to carry out the TMC's plan.

   In addition, CTAS assists controllers handling arrival air traffic in
   an area within 40 miles of a major airport. Within these areas, known
   as Terminal Radar Approach Controls (TRACONs), CTAS's Final Approach
   Spacing Tool (FAST) assists approach controllers to assign aircraft to
   runways as well as sequence and schedule aircraft onto the final
   approach to the runway.

   CTAS integrates these functions and thereby provides assistance to air
   traffic coordinators and controllers in both Centers and TRACONs.
   Moreover, it can incorporate the actions of controllers by refreshing
   advisories automatically whenever it receives controllers inputs or
   detects unplanned events. To insure accuracy, CTAS makes use of highly
   sophisticated performance models of the major aircraft types
   encountered at Centers and TRACONs including jets, turboprops, and
   piston engine aircraft. Also, each element of CTAS adapts to changes in
   the traffic situation, air traffic controller imposed constraints, and
   pilot and airline preferences. Each tool provides a distinct benefit
   while the entire suite of tools greatly improves the coordination
   between sectors and facilities.

   CTAS is being developed at the NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett
   Field, California under the scientific leadership of Dr. Heinz
   Erzberger. Basic research and development has been ongoing since 1968
   when early 4-D trajectory synthesis and air traffic control concepts
   were first explored.
