   Marking Turnaround, New CSB Budget Request Seeks Increase

                                                       TRANSLATE THIS PAGE

   (Washington, DC April 12, 2001): The CSB has released its annual budget
   justification and performance plan for fiscal year (FY) 2002. The new
   budget, transmitted to Congress and the President, requests an
   appropriation of $9 million to support Board operations during the
   fiscal year beginning October 1.

   Congress appropriated $7.5 million for CSB operations in FY2001. Just
   over $1 million of the requested increase is slated for personnel
   costs, due largely to the CSBs successful hiring program over the last
   twelve months. The balance of the increase will fund additional
   training, contract support, and office space rental. By law, the Board
   prepares and submits its budget to Congress independent of the
   Executive Branch.

   Commenting on the new budget, Board Member Dr. Andrea Kidd Taylor said:
   The Boards requested increase will support our dramatically
   strengthened Investigations & Safety Program and will result in
   heightened productivity. Weve rebuilt this program from the ground up,
   responding to the directions of Congress. We have worked closely with
   Congressional auditors and established the basis for solid
   organizational development.

   Taylor said she was pleased with the agencys record of achievement over
   the past year, including the completion of three accident investigation
   reports and a five-year strategic plan. The Board also began work on a
   much-anticipated special investigation on reactive chemical hazards,
   and so far this year launched two new investigations of incidents in
   Georgia and Indiana.

   The CSB is an independent federal agency whose mission is to ensure the
   safety of workers and the public by preventing chemical incidents. The
   CSB is a scientific investigatory organization, not an enforcement or
   regulatory body. The Board determines the root causes of accidents,
   issues safety recommendations, and performs special studies on chemical
   safety issues.
