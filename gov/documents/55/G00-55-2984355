                      Introduction to the 14th Edition

   The Alternative Farming Systems Information Center (AFSIC) is one of
   several Information Centers at the National Agricultural Library that
   provide in-depth coverage of specific subject areas relating to the
   food and agricultural sciences. AFSIC focuses on alternative farming
   systems that aim at maintaining agricultural productivity and
   profitability, while protecting natural resources. Such systems include
   sustainable, low-input, regenerative, biodynamic, and organic farming
   and gardening. Support for the Center comes from the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture's Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE)
   program and a cooperative agreement with the University of Maryland,
   College Park.

   The U.S. and international institutions and organizations in this
   directory were selected based on their curricula or programs offering
   education, training, or information in organic, alternative, or
   sustainable agriculture. Inclusion of an organization does not imply a
   recommendation by AFSIC.

   Another source to search is a Web page maintained by CABI Publishing
   with information on organic agriculture courses. This site may be found
   at http://www.organic-research.com/ac/courses.htm.

   Farms offering internships or apprenticeships are no longer included
   here, but may be found in a registry maintained by Appropriate
   Technology Transfer for Rural Areas (ATTRA), an organization that
   provides information and resources to the agriculture community. If you
   are interested in on-farm internships please check the ATTRA web site
   at http://www.attra.org under "Resources."

   Each listing in this updated edition of the directory has been verified
   with the organization. Our thanks to all those who contributed. We
   always appreciate hearing from those not listed who have programs or
   educational contributions to offer. Helpful suggestions from users of
   this directory prompted us to alter the format for this edition and we
   hope you find these changes beneficial. Additions and changes will be
   added throughout the year to the Web version of this directory. AFSIC's
   Web site address is listed below.
