                        Volunteering at the Arboretum

   group picture of curator and volunteers

   The National Arboretum has over 200 volunteers, many of whom have been
   with us over 15 years. Volunteers play an integral role in Arboretum
   programs and assist in almost every area and endeavor, performing jobs
   ranging from gardening to administrative and research support. Over
   17,600 hours of volunteer service were provided in 2000. Many
   volunteers contribute their time and talent on weekdays, although there
   are some weekend positions available. We ask most of our volunteers to
   contribute a minimum of 4 hours weekly.

   Volunteers receive orientation and training. Most positions entail a
   one-year commitment.

   opportunities at the U.S. National Arboretum, please contact:
