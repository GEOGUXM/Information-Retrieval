      Performance Ratings
      The Performance Ratings are a key component of the ODIN program because
      they set the bar against which NASA/Alterion measure suppliers
      offerings. While the Market Survey will produce Performance Ratings for
      a number of products, only the 100% rating carries contractual
      consequences. Based on the ODIN seat classifications, suppliers
      products ratings must demonstrate a performance level within a given
      percentage range of that top performing product.
        * Alterion does not charge the vendor to have a product included on
          the Market Survey.
