   ON THE ROAD, ACROSS THE STATE
   In 1975, when Tom Harkin was a congressman, he had a mobile office
   which traveled the Fifth congressional District to provide easy access
   to the services of the his office. In 1985, as a U.S. Senator, he
   continued this operation, and now Tom's mobile office visits each of
   Iowa's 99 counties at least once a year, bringing to the people of Iowa
   information about important legislative issues, holding listening posts
   to hear Iowans' concerns, and touring local projects that have received
   or are interested in looking at federal funding.
