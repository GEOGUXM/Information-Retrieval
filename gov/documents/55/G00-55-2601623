   Safety
   Title Dateline Description
   Fire and Radiation Safety Get New Emphasis From Space Research December
   13, 2001 NASA's mission success starts with safety.
   The Phantom Torso May 4, 2001 An unusual space traveler named Fred is
   orbiting Earth aboard the International Space Station. His job? To keep
   astronauts safe from space radiation.
   2001 Mars Odyssey March 19, 2001 NASA's Mars Odyssey Orbiter will seek
   out underground water-ice and explore space weather around the Red
   Planet. OBPR developed the Martian radiation environment experiment
   (MARIE) onboard the Odyssey.

   Life Support
   Title Dateline Description
   Microscopic Stowaways on the ISS November 26, 2000 Wherever humans go
   microbes will surely follow, and the Space Station is no exception.
   Breathing Easy on the Space Station November 13, 2000 Life support
   systems on the ISS provide oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide, and manage
   vaporous emissions from the astronauts themselves. It's all part of
   breathing easy in our new home in space.
   Water on the Space Station November 2, 2000 Rationing and recycling
   will be an essential part of life on the International Space Station.
   In this article, Science@NASA explores where the crew will get their
   water and how they will (re)use it.

   Exploration
   Title Dateline Description
   Can We Go to Mars Without Going Crazy? April 17, 2001 On a manned
   mission to the Red Planet, the biggest challenge will most likely be
   keeping the crew's spirits up, tempers down, and minds sharp for three
   years and an 800-million-mile round-trip.
   Microscopic Stowaways on the ISS November 26, 2000 Wherever humans go
   microbes will surely follow, and the Space Station is no exception.

   The Body in Space
   Title Dateline Description
   Healthline Radio Spots These radio news stories featuring NSBRI
   research were produced and distributed free-of-charge as part of Baylor
   College of Medicine's Radio Healthline series.
   Good Vibrations November 2, 2001 A new treatment under study by
   NASA-funded doctors could reverse bone loss experienced by astronauts
   in space.
   Space Bones October 1, 2001 Weightlessness sure looks like a lot of
   fun, but prolonged exposure to zero-G in space can have some negative
   side effects -- like the weakening of human bones!
   Wide Awake in Outer Space September 4, 2001 Space travel can be
   exciting -- and restless! NASA researchers are exploring ways to help
   astronauts enjoy a better night's sleep on the space station ... and
   beyond.
   Mixed up in Space August 7, 2001 Humans can become confused and
   disoriented -- and even a little queasy -- in an alien world where up
   and down have no meaning.
   Gravity Hurts (so Good) August 2, 2001 Gravity hurts: you can feel it
   hoisting a loaded backpack or pushing a bike up a hill. But lack of
   gravity hurts, too: when astronauts return from long-term stints in
   space, they sometimes need to be carried away in stretchers.
   The Body in Space January 1, 2001 A voyage to Mars may be every
   astronaut's dream, but the health risks to even the most superbly
   conditioned earthlings are formidable indeed.
   Biomedical Science for Space Travelers Radio Documentary Series The
   Morehouse School of Medicine, in collaboration with WABE-AM in Atlanta
   and SoundPrint, Inc., produced the six-part series Biomedical Science
   for Space Travelers, which discusses the effects of space travel on the
   human body. The topics covered in the radio series are: Space Aging,
   Getting Your Bearings, The Human Clock, The Enigma Force, Health Over
   the Horizon, The Long Distance Patient

   Fluids
   Title Dateline Description
   Suds In Space September 21, 2001 Bubbly, frothing and ticklish -- soft
   drinks and beer promise a welcome taste of home to faraway space
   travelers. For the tradition of beer and its fizzy cousins to continue
   as people begin settling space, a few questions must first be answered.
   Flowing Sand in Space November 17, 2000 NASA scientists are sending
   sand into Earth orbit to learn more about how soil behaves during
   earthquakes. Their results will help engineers build safer structures
   on Earth and someday on other planets, too.
   Geophysical Fluid Flow Cell Experiments March 6, 2000 'Planets in a
   test tube' experiment yields hints about planetary circulation
   The Physics of Orange Juice November 3, 1998 Shuttle experiments target
   the behavior of fluid mixtures in microgravity.
   The Man Who Defies Gravity July 2, 2001 "Chuck Rosenblatt can levitate
   liquid. This article about his OBPR sponsored research in the area of
   liquid crystals appears in the spring issue 2001 of CWRU Magazine.
   Bizzare Boiling September 7, 2001 The next time you're watching a pot
   of water boil, perhaps for coffee or a cup of soup, pause for a moment
   and consider: what would this look like in space? Would the turbulent
   bubbles rise or fall? And how big would they be? Would the liquid stay
   in the pan at all?

   Plants
   Title Dateline Description
   Space Seeds Return to Earth July 25, 2001 Seed pods from a commercial
   gardening experiment aboard the ISS are back on our planet. The far-out
   pods could hold the key to long-term habitation of space.

   glowing plants--part mustard and part jellyfish-- to help humans
   explore Mars.
