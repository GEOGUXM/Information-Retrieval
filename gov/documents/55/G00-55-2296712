    Instructions for Filing an Appeal for Petitioners not Represented by an
    Attorney
        ____________________________________________________________

   NOTE: THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ONLY INTENDED TO SERVE AS AN ADDITIONAL
   AID TO PETITIONERS WHO ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY. THE FULL SET
   OF RULES OF PROCEDURE ARE FOUND IN THE REGULATIONS OF THE COMMISSIONER
   OF EDUCATION (PARTS 275, 276 AND 277). ALL PETITIONERS ARE ENCOURAGED
   TO CONSULT WITH THEIR OWN ATTORNEY BEFORE FILING AN APPEAL.

   A ยง310 appeal is a formal appeal to the Commissioner of Education which
   must be initiated within 30 days of the decision or action complained
   of. If you have not filed your petition within 30 days of the action
   complained of, you must include in your petition the reasons your
   papers have been filed after the deadline. The Commissioner will then
   decide if you have shown "good cause" for late filing.

I. GENERAL GUIDELINES

    1. The petitioner is the person bringing the petition and verifying it
       (see description of verification below). While any individual may
       assist the petitioner in preparing the petition, the named
       petitioner in the appeal must be a person in parental relationship
       to the child. "Persons in parental relationship" include parents,
       guardians, custodians or persons having the care, custody or
       control of the child. If the student is over the age of 18, that
       individual may be the petitioner.
       If an appeal is brought involving issues unrelated to specific
       students, the petitioner must be an individual who has suffered
       personal damage or impairment of his or her civil, personal or
       property rights.
    2. The board of education (school district) or BOCES usually is the
       respondent.
    3. You may refer to the parties as petitioner (yourself) and
       respondent (the board of education, BOCES and/or their staff) in
       your papers.
            ________________________________________________________

      II. DRAFTING A PETITION

    1. To bring an appeal you must provide:
         a. A Notice of Petition as the first page of the petition. (see
            Form 1)
         b. A Petition (see sample petition- Form 6).
              1. The petition must be signed by the petitioner with
                 petitioner's name, post office address and telephone
                 number.
              2. The petition must be verified - A verified petition is a
                 petition, signed by the petitioner, in the presence of a
                 Notary Public, establishing that the petitioner is, in
                 fact, the person making the complaint, is familiar with
                 the facts of the complaint, and believes them to be true.
                 (see Form 2)
    2. A caption should appear on the top of the first page of your
       petition and on all other forms and affidavits. (see sample
       petition- Form 6)
         a. You may wish to attach affidavits (sworn statements) from
            persons other than the petitioner, exhibits or other documents
            to your petition. If you do, you must label each exhibit (A,
            B, C, etc.) and refer to them in the petition.
    3. Your petition must be:
         a. typewritten
         b. double spaced
         c. on white 8 1/2 x 11 paper
         d. your claims must be set forth in short, numbered paragraphs.
              1. Each numbered paragraph must contain clear and concise
                 statements to show why you are entitled to relief as a
                 result of the actions or decisions complained of.
              2. Be sure the petition sets forth a clear statement of the
                 actions of the school district about which you are
                 complaining.
         e. You must end the petition with a demand for relief where you
            tell the Commissioner what you want him to order (e.g. stop
            the practice, restore the grade, return the student to school,
            etc.).
         f. If you wish to request an opportunity to appear before the
            Commissioner to present oral argument of the matter, you must
            include your request for oral argument in your petition.
        ____________________________________________________________

III. REQUEST FOR A STAY

   The Commissioner can temporarily undue the school district's action
   until your case is decided. This is called a "stay." If you want to
   request a stay of the opposing party's action while your case is before
   the Commissioner, you must include your request for a stay in the
   petition and state the facts and legal reasons why you believe a stay
   should be granted. You must include as part of your Notice of Petition
   an additional paragraph stating:

          "Please take further notice that the within petition contains an
          application for a stay order. Affidavits in opposition to the
          application for a stay must be served on all other parties and
          filed with the Office of Counsel within three (3) business days
          after service of the petition."

   NOTE:
   The request for a stay should be included in the petition and served at
   the same time.
        ____________________________________________________________
