                     An interactive television broadcast

                    Explosive Effects and Countermeasures
                                 (ERO-170D)
                          Tuesday, October 2, 2001
                              10 AM - 12 PM EDT
                                     OR
                               1 PM - 3 PM EDT

     Because there are no breaks for lunch, consider bringing a sack lunch
                              to the classroom.

      Presentations:

        * Benefits of Enforceable Standoff Distances and Vehicle Barriers
          (PowerPoint Presentation)
        * Building Blast (Movie - .mpg)
        * INMM Paper - Blast Effects and Barriers
          (Adobe Acrobat - .pdf)

      Abstract
      The impact of a vehicle bomb blast on a building can be determined by
      analyzing all of the following:

       1. Over pressure that the building structural elements can withstand
       2. Standoff distance that can be enforced
       3. Potential damage from a specific amount of explosives detonated at
          an enforceable standoff distance

      This presentation addresses the potential effects of a postulated bomb
      blast and identification of protective measures to reduce risk. Section
      one describes the effects of a bomb blast on the buildings and
      occupants (e.g., columns, walls, windows, and personnel) as well as
      charts and graphs for determining blast effects. Section two shows how
      to calculate the kinetic energy and the maximum attainable vehicle
      speed for a moving vehicle. Section three provides suggestions for
      conducting such an analysis, including the use of available software.

      Who will benefit
      The primary audience is DOE and contractor emergency management and
      security supervisors/staff and persons responsible for emergency
      management or security oversight or training.

      Prerequisites
      None
