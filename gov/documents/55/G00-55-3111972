     Special Note: Today there are very many fine Web sites for Astronomy
     Education. We cannot and should not duplicate those pages here, nor
     can we include links to all of them. Instead, this page includes
     information on using ADC resources and links to selected external
     resources for learning about or teaching astronomy. If you have
     suggestions for additional links, please send them to the curators
     at the e-mail addresses listed at the bottom of the page. We regret
     that we may not be able to accommodate every such request. THE ADC
     IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENT OF EXTERNAL SITES LINKED FROM

   Educational Uses of ADC

  Educational Resources from the ADC:

     * ADC's Space and Astronomy Quiz
     * ADC's Astronomical Word Finding Puzzle

  How can I use the ADC in my classroom?

   The Astronomical Data Center specializes in archiving and distributing
   collections of data that have been published by professional
   astronomers. Most of these data sets are in the form of
   computer-readable tables of numbers, rather than images. (Check out our
   ADC CD-ROMs which contain hundreds of astronomical catalogs.)

   In spite of our emphasis on serving professional astronomers, we have
   data that can be used by educators for hands-on astronomy learning.
   Examples of the kinds of questions that students could address are:
    1. Make a model of the stars within 20 light years of the sun. Make
       the balls to size and color them appropriately.
    2. Make another model to show the positions of these stars 10,000,000
       years from now.
    3. Make a series of drawings to show how the appearance of the Big
       Dipper changes with time at 10,000 year intervals.
    4. What color (spectral type) are most variable stars with periods
       longer than 200 days? Is the answer the same for stars with periods
       less than 1 day?
    5. Are there any variable stars you might be able to see from where
       you live without a telescope? At what time of the year? How
       frequently would you have to look at them to see them vary? To plot
       a light curve?
    6. In what direction, with respect to the sun, do stars with radial
       velocities larger than 100 km/sec move?
    7. Among the stars nearer than 200 light years, do any appear to be
       approaching the sun? If so, how close to the sun will each come?
       When?

   Where can I find:
     * The positions of the 100 brightest stars?
     * Stars identified by their Bayer, Flamsteed, or common
       (navigational) names?
     * The stars within 50 light years?
     * The twenty nearest stars?
     * Accurate modern positions for stars?
     * Information about Hipparcos catalogs?
     * Information about the Copernicus Atlases?
     * Information about the Messier Catalog?
