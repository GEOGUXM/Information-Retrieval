   12. How fast does a Space Shuttle travel? What is its altitude? How
   much fuel does it use?
   The Space Shuttle must reach speeds of about 17,500 mph (28,000
   kilometers per hour) to remain in orbit. The exact speed depends on the
   shuttle's orbital altitude, which normally ranges from 190 miles to 330
   miles (304 kilometers to 528 kilometers) above sea level, depending on
   its mission.

   Each of the two solid rocket boosters on the shuttle carries more than
   one million pounds of solid propellant. The shuttle's large external
   tank is loaded with more than 500,000 gallons of super-cold liquid
   oxygen and liquid hydrogen, which are mixed and burned together to form
   the fuel for the shuttle's three main rocket engines.

   13. How do I get satellite information?
   Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is the NASA center
   responsible for satellite programs. It has information on satellite
   images, the Hubble Space Telescope space tracking and space debris. The
   phone number is 301-286-5566.

   14. Where can I find more technical information on NASA's research?
   Requests for NASA technical publications and papers should be directed
   to:
     NASA STI Help Desk
     NASA Center for Aerospace Information
     7121 Standard Drive

   On-line portraits are also available.

   16. How can I become an astronaut?
   Competition is extremely keen, with an average of more than 4,000
   applicants for about 20 openings every 2 years. Astronaut recruiting
   occurs periodically. For more information, write to:
    Astronaut Selection Office
    NASA Johnson Space Center

   19. Is there any chance for a school to run a science experiment on the
   shuttle?
   NASA's Get Away Special (GAS) program allows science and
   engineering-oriented experiments to fly aboard the Space Shuttle for as
   little as $3,000, often funded by private industry. If you or your
   school is interested in this program, more information may be obtained
   by contacting:
    Shuttle Small Payloads Project
    Customer Support Office, NASA/GSFC/740
    Greenbelt, MD 20771
    Telephone (301) 286-3388; Fax (301) 286-1694;
    E-mail: sspp.office@cc-mail.gsfc.nasa.gov.

   20. Where can I get NASA's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
   regulations, a listing of NASA FOIA contacts and general information
   regarding FOIA?
   Information on NASA FOIA can be reached at
   http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/FOIA/guide.html or by calling
   202/358-1753.

   21. What is NASA's budget, and why not divert money spent on space
   exploration into social programs?
   NASA's funding represents only about one penny out of every dollar in
   the U.S. federal budget. Diverting this money into social programs
   would provide a very minimal increase for those immediate needs, while
   eliminating resources devoted to the future and new solutions to
   problems. Information on NASA's budget can be found at
   http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/budget/2001/budget_summary.pdf.

   22. How has NASA benefitted the United States?
   * NASA has the smallest budget of the major agencies in the federal
   government, less than 1 percent since 1977.

   * NASA has expanded human knowledge through a program of exploration
   and discovery.

   * Virtually every aircraft utilizes technology pioneered by NASA.
   Aeronautics is one of the nation 's strongest industries, employing
   almost one million Americans.

   * The U.S. Aerospace industry generates over $40 billion in annual
   exports and $30 billion in positive balance of trade each year.

   * New industries have been built on space technology, including
   personal computers, advanced medical equipment, communications
   satellites, weather forecasting and natural resource mapping.

   * NASA's high-technology research and development generates jobs, the
   demands for goods and services, and new technologies in the private
   sector.

   * Many NASA technologies contribute to research in education,
   transportation, pollution control, rain forest protection and health
   care. For a sample of these see the NASA publication, Spinoff.

   23. When are we going to Mars?
   NASA currently plans to operate the Space Station for at least the
   first decade of the next century then send astronauts back to the moon
   or on to Mars during the second decade of the new century. This time
   frame could change with technological breakthroughs.
