   Breaker number 4 on the outside of the building was found to be
   tripped. Tried to reset the breaker but it would immediately trip
   again. Contacted Dan Nelson in order to gain access into the building.
   Found that the UPS was causing the breaker to be tripped. Installed a
   spare UPS that Craig Webb had on hand. This allowed the instrument to
   be put back in service. Contacted Lee Harrison and he is going to send
   us another UPS to replace the one that was not operating. We are to
   return the original UPS back to the address he will ship with the new
   UPS next week.
