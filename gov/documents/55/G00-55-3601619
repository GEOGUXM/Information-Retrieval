    The Florida Caribbean Science Center is dedicated to conducting sound
      scientific research supporting the needs of the Department of the
   Interior, and States in the southeastern region.  Established in 1985,
       the original mission of the center was to study the impacts of
   nonindigenous species in the U.S., to restore imperiled freshwater and
   estuarine species, and restore anadromous fish populations.  The Center
   has since evolved into a multidisciplinary research center, devoted to
   answering the regional ecological questions raised by both manmade and
     natural environmental changes in the southeastern United States and
                              Caribbean Basin.

     As part of the Biological Resources Division of the U.S. Geological
   Survey we work on large-scale issues impacting the nation's resources.
    Biologists, ecologists, and technicians are involved in research from
       Alabama to Tennessee to the U.S. Virgin Islands, and of course
                             throughout Florida.

     We invite you to explore this site to learn more about us.  If you
   would like more information or have further questions about the Center
   when you've completed you online tour, or if you'd like to suggest how
        we might improve our materials, please send your comments or
                   suggestions via electronic mail to the
   Webmaster, or you can write to:
