     Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) within our court setting is a
     group of practices, procedures or techniques for resolving and
     managing disputes short of full-scale court process and trial.
     Because this Court has long recognized that full, formal litigation
     of claims can impose serious economic burdens on parties and can
     delay resolution of disputes for considerable periods, the Court
     provides various ADR and settlement programs with panels of private
     attorneys and professionals as well as judicial officers and court
     personnel to help prevent delay and save costs. These procedures are
     authorized by federal statute, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and
     Local Court Rules. The options include:
     * Mediation
     * Early Neutral Evaluation
     * Arbitration
     * Judicial Settlement Conferences
     * Summary/Advisory Trials

     The ADR Administrator, Ann Marshall, is available to answer
     settlement conference questions and to help parties determine which
     ADR program is most suitable to a particular case or to customize an
     ADR process to meet parties needs. Contact Ann Marshall by phone:
     (405) 609-5078.

     Mediation Program

     Mediation is a flexible, non-binding process in which an impartial
     third person, the mediator, facilitates communication between
     disputing parties, assists negotiation and promotes understanding,
     reconciliation and settlement. The purpose of this procedure in this
     Court is to provide parties a very early dispute resolution process
     before positions harden and costs become too great.

     Early Neutral Evaluation (ENE) Program

     ENE brings all parties and their counsel together early in the
     pretrial period for a confidential session to receive a non-binding
     assessment by an experienced neutral attorney with subject-matter
     expertise. The objective of ENE is to expedite the legal process,
     clarify issues and position the case for early resolution by
     settlement, dispositive motion or trial thereby potentially reducing
     costs. The evaluator can serve as a mentor in the case evaluation
     process, will provide case planning guidance and, if requested by
     the parties, may offer settlement assistance.

     Arbitration Program (non-binding and binding)

     Non-binding arbitration is essentially an adjudicative process in
     which an arbitrator or panel of three arbitrators issues a
     non-binding award on the merits after an expedited, adversarial
     hearing. It was originated for contract or tort cases of more modest
     dollar amounts; however any case may consent to use the program. It
     is less formal and less expensive than a full trial. Limited use of
     witness testimony and limited cross-examination under oath are
     allowed. The non-binding award can be used as a basis for subsequent
     negotiations or can be accepted and entered as judgment. Either
     party may reject the non-binding award and file a demand for trial
     de novo in writing and pay the required deposit fees of $150 for one
     arbitrator or $300 for a panel of three arbitrators.

     At any time prior to the commencement of the arbitration hearing,
     the parties may, by written stipulation, or joint application
     approved by order of the assigned judge, waive the right to a trial
     de novo following the award and proceed as in voluntary arbitration.
     The parties may continue to utilize the ADR staff and program
     administration to bring the case to conclusion. In the event of such
     a stipulation, the provision of state and federal law governing
     review of awards rendered in voluntary, binding arbitration shall
     govern.

     Judicial Settlement Conferences

     This is a facilitative, evaluative and collaborative process in
     which a full-time magistrate judge assists negotiation and
     resolution among the parties for every case set on a published trial
     docket.

     Summary Trials and Other Court ADR

     A summary jury or bench trial is a flexible, non-binding process
     before a regular federal court jury or judge designed to promote
     settlement thereby saving costs in complex, trial-ready cases headed
     for protracted trials. The judge or jurys non-binding verdict can
     be used as a basis for subsequent settlement negotiations. The
     parties may stipulate to be bound by the summary decision. Summary
     bench trials are usually presented to a magistrate judge. These
     processes are described in more detail in the Supplement to the
     Local Rules, Plan for Alternative Dispute Resolution and Settlement
     Procedures and Rules of Practice at LCvR16.3 Supp. §§ 6.1 through
     7.8. Executive mini-trial is also an option available. See LCvR16.3
     Supp §8.1 et seq.
