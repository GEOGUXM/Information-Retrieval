                                   Mediation

   Mediation is a fair and efficient process to help you resolve your
   employment disputes and reach an agreement. A neutral mediator assists
   you in reaching a voluntary, negotiated agreement. Choosing mediation
   to resolve employment discrimination disputes promotes a better work
   environment, reduces costs and works for the employer and the employee.

   A few satisfied customers ...

     "I was very satisfied with the process and I think all the managers
     would agree with that. The outcome was far better than anything that
     could have been obtained through administrative proceedings."
     Mike Godfrey, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, FINA

     "I have been involved in four separate mediations conducted by the
     EEOC. I think the process is effective and efficient, particularly
     when an employee is still employed by the respondent."
     Julia Carter
     Arizona Center for Disability Law

     "Our resolution rate in mediation between the EEOC and state and
     local agencies is 70 percent resolution at the table, and that
     typically is in the one-day mediation stage. You get it done and
     focus on resolution."

     Director of Fair Employment for Giant Food, Inc.
