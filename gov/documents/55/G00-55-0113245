   The Ulysses Mission is the first spacecraft to explore interplanetary
   space at high solar latitudes. Ulysses is a joint endeavor of the
   European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration (NASA) of the USA. The spacecraft and spacecraft
   operations team are provided by ESA, the launch of the spacecraft,
   radio tracking, and data management operations are provided by NASA.
   Scientific experiments are provided by investigation teams both in
   Europe and the USA.

    The spacecraft was launched on Oct. 6, 1990 by the shuttle Discovery
    with two upper stages. To reach high solar latitudes, the spacecraft
   was aimed close to Jupiter so that Jupiter's large gravitational field
    would accelerate Ulysses out of the ecliptic plane to high latitudes;
   no man made launch vehicle could by itself provide the needed velocity
                   for Ulysses to achieve high latitudes.

     Encounter with Jupiter occurred on February 8, 1992, and since then
   Ulysses travelled to higher latitudes with maximum Southern latitude of
     80.2 degrees being achieved on Sept. 13, 1994. Ulysses will travel
   through high Northern latitudes during June through September of 1995.
    These high latitude observations are being obtained during the quiet
   (minimum) portion of the 11 year solar cycle. The spacecraft's orbital
      period is six years and, if kept in operation, the high latitude
    observations will be obtained during the active (maximum) portion of
                              the solar cycle.
