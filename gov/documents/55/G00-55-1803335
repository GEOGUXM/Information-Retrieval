   Workforce Information

   Overview
   Demographics are particularly useful to managers in the workforce
   planning process.  These data are also used by Congressional staffers
   and others who have an interest in the size and makeup of the federal
   workforce, and by public and private organizations and individuals
   interested in the diversity of DOT for a wide variety of reasons.
