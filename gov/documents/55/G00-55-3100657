   Working through conflicts related to the environment, natural
   resources, and public lands involves using a range of methods of
   alternative dispute resolution. Unlike traditional litigation, in which
   a judge or jury may impose a judgement or make a final determination,
   alternative methods of assisted negotiation  such as facilitation,
   mediation, and conflict assessment  allow all parties or stakeholders
   in a dispute to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement on their own
   terms. The process of mediation, for instance, provides stakeholders
   with an opportunity to work out their differences and arrive at joint
   solutions with the help of an impartial mediator. Doing so can save
   time and avoid many of the costs of traditional legal proceedings. In
   addition, stakeholders who work toward a shared, positive outcome can
   often achieve better results than they would have received in court.

   The Institute also provides assistance in consensus-based processes,
   such as negotiated rule-making, community-based collaborations, and
   policy dialogues. Here, the goal is to engage representatives from all
   groups affected by proposed federal policies or actions in
   participating in their formulation, revision, or implementation.
