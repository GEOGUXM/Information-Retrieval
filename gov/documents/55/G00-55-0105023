   Success Stories

      The concept for an initiative with the vision of accelerating the
      ability of DOE to meet its missions through advanced computing and
      communications technologies was born over five years ago--it was
      referred to as DOE2000 and developing national collaboratories was a
      key element of the program. The vignettes highlighted here were made
      possible in part by funding of that initiative. However, some of
      vignettes are a result of the influence of the program's successes.
        * Remote Operation Of Unique Instrumentation Can Speed Up Research
        * Remote Operation Works Internationally
        * Collaboratories Are Influencing Industry Directions
        * Real-time Reconstruction of Microtomographic Data Becomes Possible
        * Going Paper-Free in the Clean Room

   Bottom line, look only DOE Logo

   The U.S. Department of Energy's
   National Collaboratories program is
   sponsored by the Office of Mathematical,
   Information, and Computational Sciences.
