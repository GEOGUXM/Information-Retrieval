   The base privileges listed below are provided to Uniformed Service
   members and their eligible dependents, often on a space-available
   basis.  These privileges are regulated by the Department of Defense
   (DOD) but administered by the local base command.  While usage is
   generally the same for all bases, the local commander has the authority
   to limit or restrict access as he/she deems necessary.  Presentation of
   a Uniformed Services identification (ID) card is needed to access these
   services.  An ID card may be obtained through the agency/program where
   the officer works or the nearest DoD facility.
