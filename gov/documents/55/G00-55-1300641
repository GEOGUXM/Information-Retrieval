      For the TESP Initiative, "critical facilities" are defined as those
      that perform functions critical to the monitoring, control, support,
      signaling, and switching of the voice telecommunications infrastructure
      (terrestrial and satellite). These facilities are divided into the
      following three categories:

   Category I

      Network facilities or elements essential to monitoring, controlling, or
      supporting network operations (e.g., network management control
      centers, operations support systems, signaling network elements).

   Category II

      All switching nodes identified as serving essential NS/EP end users in
      local exchange carrier (LEC) or interexchange carrier (IC) networks,
      (e.g., end offices, access tandems, IC switches, international
      gateways).

   Category III

      Other network elements (not identified in Categories I or II) essential
      to network operation for call completion (e.g., regenerators) and
      identified by service vendors.
