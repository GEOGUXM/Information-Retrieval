   Geomagnetism
   The Geomagnetism program was formed as part of the USGS Magnetic Field
   Monitoring and Charting Program to meet the growing needs for
   geomagnetic data and information.
   The National Geomagnetic Information Center (NGIC) was formed as part
   of the USGS Magnetic Field Monitoring and Charting Program to meet the
   growing needs for geomagnetic data and information.
   USGS operates thirteen Magnetic Observatories
   A magnetic observatory is a controlled facility with a non-magnetic
   environment for the continuous monitoring of the Earth's magnetic
   field. The USGS observatories send their data to the NGIC data
   processing center directly via satellite.
   US Regional Magnetic Charts
   The United States charts show the 48 conterminous states at a scale of
   1:5,000,000, and Alaska and Hawaii (on the back) at 1:3,500,000, on
   Albers Equal-Area projections. They are multicolored and are 31 x 45
   inches in size.
