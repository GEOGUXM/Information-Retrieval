   Issues

      The population of the southwestern United States has grown rapidly over
      the past two decades and is projected to increase greatly over the next
      several decades. As the population has grown, climatic variations that
      would have affected relatively few people in the past will impact the
      lives of millions. Rapid and wide-spread climatic changes, such as
      those seen thousands and hundreds of years ago in the region and those
      projected for the future, may profoundly change the character of the
      region. Arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern U.S. are among
      the most sensitive regions to changes in climate and land use, but the
      potential interactions between climatic change and land use are largely
      unknown.

      U.S. Geological Survey and collaborating scientists are seeking to
      understand how climatic characteristics and land use have influenced
      surficial geologic processes that modify landscapes and ecosystems.
      Such understanding is then used to model the landscape's response to
      future changes in climate and land use over time scales of seasons, of
      a few years, and of a few decades, so that information and
      interpretations can be applied by federal, state, and local agencies,
      as well as by Native American governments, for their land-use planning
      and management of resources.

      Project scientists work with biologists, hydrologists, geographers,
      cartographers, and archeologists to address questions about:
        * the causes and timing of changes in alluvial environments (rivers,
          streams, hillslopes), such as flooding, the cutting and filling of
          arroyos, and sediment discharge;
        * the interrelations among climate, vegetation, human activity, and
          eolian (wind-related) processes;
        * the role of eolian dust for soil fertility, invasion of exotic
          species, hydrology, and surface stability in deserts;
        * the interaction of physical and biologic processes critical for
          ecosystem functions;
        * how climate in the southwest has varied over decades, centuries,
          and millennia;
        * how future climatic variations will affect the Southwestern land
          surface (in terms of flooding, landslides, erosion, sand-dune
          activity, dust-storm frequency);
        * how past climatic changes and environments affected prehistoric
          cultures.

   Goals

   To Understand:

        How past climatic change affected the land surface: soil loss,
      fluvial erosion & alluviation, sand-dune mobilization, ecosystems
      Time frames: Past decades, centuries, millennia

     Today's interplay among climate, land use and surface processes (both
   geologic & ecologic)

     Impacts of future climate on the land surface
   Time frames: Seasons; El Niño/La Niña cycles; multi-year wet/drought
   periods; and decades, as atmospheric CO[2] increases

   A major goal is to interact with federal, state, and local government
   agencies as well as non-governmental organizations to provide
   information useful for management decisions regarding land-surface
   vulnerability to natural and human disturbances. Another goal is to
   provide ongoing remote sensing and meteorological monitoring bearing on
   land-surface change.
            _____________________________________________________

Approaches

     * Compare geologic and climatic records
     * Monitor weather and land-surface change
     * Focus on ecologically sensitive areas (ecosystem studies)
     * Modeling
          + Process models (geologic-climatic-biologic)
          + Regional climate model for the Southwest
     * Compile GIS and remote sensing data to characterize Southwestern
       land surfaces
            _____________________________________________________

Products

   The studies will generate the following kinds of products:

     * Maps of surficial deposits, vegetation, climate parameters,
       detected change (especially eolian vulnerability) prepared in GIS
       and other map formats from surface and remote-sensing mapping and
       from climate data.
     * GIS-derived maps of demographics, resources, and land use.
     * Maps of fluvial deposits and channels.
     * Data sets of meteorological observations (that help define climatic
       variability), landscape responses, and hydroclimatology.
     * Mapped summaries of areas, characterized by type of disturbance or
       impact (e.g., regional maps showing vulnerabilities to types of
       disturbance such as arroyo-cutting, sand-dune reactivation, or
       vegetation change).
     * Compilations of data sets that document the history of climatic
       change.
     * Interpretive reports and maps on geologic deposits, processes, and
       forecasts.
     * Maps of process response to climate variability from regional
       climate modeling.

   These studies are supported by the USGS Earth Surface Dynamics Program
   and are conducted in collaboration with many federal, state, and local
   agencies including the National Park Service, NASA, NOAA, BLM, and DoD,
   as well as with university and non-governmental cooperators.
