     Welcome to Wyoming's web site for Comprehensive Nutrient Management
   Plan (CNMP) development! This web site is designed to take you through
   the process of developing a CNMP for your operation. It is meant for
   use by livestock producers of all kinds including cattle-feeders,
   dairies, cow-calf operations, horse owners, and poultry and pork
   producers. Crop and environmental consultants may also find it useful
   to help their clients.
   The purpose of this web site is to help you develop your own CNMP. The
   first thing you may want to do is determine whether you have an Animal
   Feeding Operation, and might benefit from the development of a CNMP.
   So what is a CNMP? A CNMP is a detailed plan that includes the
   following components: feed management, manure handling and storage,
   land application of manure, land management, record keeping, and other
   utilization options. In the workbook, we've broken this down to 15
   short sections which you can complete at your own pace. We recommend
   you print the sections, complete them, and store them in a notebook.
   Please let us know if you have ideas for improving this workbook or if
   you have any questions. E-mail Paul Shelton (paul.shelton@wy.usda.gov)
   at USDA-NRCS with your input.
