         The Engineering Directorate (ED) provides quality aerospace
     crosscutting engineering services, technologies, and products to a
                 broad range of Center and Agency customers.
     Our primary customers are the various Product Line Directorates and
         Project Offices at MSFC, including the Space Transportation
   Directorate, the Flight Projects Directorate, the Science Directorate,
    and the Space Shuttle Projects Office. A listing of primary programs
     and projects supported for each of these key customers is provided
                                   below.

   ED leads or supports a number of Agency-level programs or initiatives,
    including the Space Environments and Effects (SEE) Program, the NASA
    Technical Standards Program, the NASA Operational Environmental Team
       (NOET), and Intelligent Synthesis Environment (ISE) activities.

      We support other Centers, other agencies, and industry through a
   variety of Intra-agency agreements, Inter-agency agreements, and Space
    Act Agreements. In addition, ED actively participates in a number of
    independent research initiatives through the Independent Research and
     Development (IR&D) and Center Director's Discretionary Fund (CDDF)
                                   forums.

   Our customers depend on us to consistently deliver quality products and
   services in a timely and cost effective manner. In accordance with our
   Center values, we are accountable to our customers and are committed to
                 customer satisfaction and mission success.
