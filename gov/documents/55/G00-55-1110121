                            What is the FairTax?

   On July 17 of this year, I sponsored The FairTax Act of 2001, H.R.
   2525. The FairTax is one of the most exciting proposals to ever reach
   the American people. It offers long-needed tax relief in the form of
   lower prices, nearly nonexistent compliance costs, and the ability to
   choose how much to spend in taxes to all Americans, while eliminating
   the income tax and allowing Americans to keep 100 percent of their
   paycheck. The FairTax will dramatically reduce prices, protect and
   ensure funding of Social Security and Medicare, empower the low-income
   earners, and put choice and control back into the hands of every
   American. All the crucial elements are in place: a public that is eager
   and ready for a fairer tax system, and a Congress willing to seriously
   consider genuine tax reform. To be competitive in the next century and
   to renew the American dream, we must change the way we fund our
   national government.

    The FairTax Act:
     * Repeals the all corporate and individual income taxes, payroll
       taxes, self-employment taxes, capital gains taxes, estate taxes and
       gift taxes.
     * Imposes a revenue-neutral national sales tax on all new goods and
       services at the point of final purchase for consumption.
       Business-to-business transactions and used products (which have
       already been taxed) are not subject to the sales tax.
     * Offers a universal rebate in an amount equal to the sales tax on
       essential goods and services so that no American pays taxes on the
       purchase of necessities.

    Results of the FairTax:
     * Dramatically reduce the costs of goods and services by 20 to 30
       percent.
     * Allow you to keep 100 percent of your paycheck, pension, and Social
       Security payments.
     * Gross Domestic Product will increase by almost 10.5 percent in the
       first year after enactment.
     * Compliance costs would decrease by 90 percent.
     * Real investment would initially increase by 76 percent relative to
       the investment that would be made under present law.  While this
       increase would gradually decline, it remains 15 percent higher than
       under the existing tax structure.
     * Exports would increase by 26 percent initially and would remain
       more than 13 percent above the level under the current tax system.
     * Real wages will increase.
     * The working poor would experience an increase in real lifetime
       consumption of between 8 and 14 percent.
     * Increases incentives to work by as much as 20 percent in many
       households, leading to higher economic growth and efficiency.
     * Interest rates will fall 25 to 35 percent.
