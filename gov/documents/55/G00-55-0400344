   EOS Desktop Pictures

   Introduction
   These images are derived from the Earth Observatory's Image of the Day
   and Visible Earth. They include text from the original captions to help
   explain the image. We're working on text-less versions of these images
   for those just wanting the image. We hope you find these as great
   back-drops for work or play. Enjoy!

   Directions
   Please take a look at the preview image which is a smaller version of
   the desktop picture. This should give you a good idea if you would like
   to download the full-sized version. Then simply follow the link to the
   resolution of the picture you want. The picture will appear in your
   browser. Then click and hold on the picture and select "Save this Image
   As..." from the popup menu. You may also be able to click and hold on
   the picture and drag it to your desktop to save it.

   Note: These images may take a while to download due to their size,
   especially for the larger resolutions.
