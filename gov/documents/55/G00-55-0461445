                            MAIL DELIVERY NOTICE

       The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Columbia is currently
   experiencing problems sending and receiving mail from the U.S. Post
   Office.  We are not sure how long this will last.  You may want to
   explore alternate ways of sending documents and other mail to the
   courthouse.  The court is generally waiting an additional four days
   after the deadline for the filing of any objection, opposition, or
   answer before acting on a matter as unopposed.  As we receive updated
   information, we will make that available.

   Thank you for your patience.
