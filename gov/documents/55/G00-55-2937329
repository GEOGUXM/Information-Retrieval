     __________________________________________________________________

       The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) maps, describes, and seeks to
    understand Minnesota's mineral, water, and biological resources. The
     USGS is known for impartial data collection and data interpretation
    that enable resource planners and others to make informed decisions.
     Today's issues are more pressing than ever-- understanding natural
   hazards to minimize their effects on life and property, the continuing
   need for mineral- and water-resource development, and understanding the
   effects of human activities on water resources. As the Nation's leading
   natural-science agency, the USGS works with other Federal agencies and
       State and local agencies in addressing these issues. Watershed
   districts; soil- and water-conservation districts; Tribal governments;
      mining industries; educators; city, county, regional, State, and
   Federal planning agencies; consulting firms; crop consultants; farmers;
     and other private citizens use USGS maps, interpretive reports, and
                    data to manage Minnesota's resources.
              _________________________________________________

                              Mineral Resources
   Economic growth and development in Minnesota depend, in part, on the
      availability of local sources of minerals for use in industry and
       manufacturing and for maintaining and upgrading transportation
    networks. Raw materials, such as sand and gravel, are needed by State
     agencies and private industrial and construction firms to construct
     roads and buildings. To ensure continued growth and development of
      industry, new sources of construction materials and other mineral
   resources must be identified because existing supplies are limited and
     because land-use constraints rule out exploitation of some geologic
    resources. Minnesota not only contains identified resources of iron,
    copper, and nickel, the State also has potential for developing gold,
      zinc, platinum, and other minerals of local, national, and global
   importance. Extraction and processing of these mineral resources could
          form the basis for enhanced local and regional economies.

     The USGS is developing an integrated digital geologic, geochemical,
        geophysical, and mineral-resource database and assessment of
   undiscovered mineral resources in the State. This database can be used
      to address regional land use, environmental, and mineral-resource
    issues. A recent product, prepared in cooperation with the Minnesota
    Geological Survey, is the digital geologic bedrock map for Minnesota,
     Wisconsin, and Michigan. Maps and reports in digital and paper form
     assist Federal, State, and local land-management agencies to ensure
       adequate supplies of minerals at low cost and to promote sound
          management of the region's substantial mineral resources.

                              Geologic Mapping
    The USGS statemap Program is supporting detailed geologic mapping at
   the 1:24,000 scale of an area of rapidly expanding population southwest
   of Minneapolis. The Program provides digitized geologic data for use by
       planners and resource managers in dealing with land-use issues
    including well-head protection, septic-system regulation, open-space
     set-asides, sand and gravel resource protection, and flood-related
                                   zoning.

                             Water Availability
   Water is a significant economic and recreational resource of Minnesota,
     making the State well known as ``The Land of 10,000 Lakes.'' During
      1995, about 79 percent of all Minnesotans obtained their domestic
     supplies from ground water and nearly 750 million gallons of ground
   water were withdrawn every day. During the past 20 years, ground-water
       withdrawals from glacial and bedrock aquifers in Minnesota have
       increased, particularly for irrigation in areas of sandy soils.
      Irrigated acreage in many sandy areas increased by a factor of 10
       during the 1970's, according to the soil and water conservation
     districts. Anticipated future changes in land use, population, and
      economic development also will increase ground-water withdrawals.
      Because of these increased demands, State and local agencies are
     concerned about the effects of drought on water supplies, long-term
       sustainable yields of wells, effects of pumping on ground- and
   surface-water levels, and interferences among nearby wells pumping from
                              the same aquifer.

           Minnesota, 1980-1997 (click to view full-sized image).

    The USGS is the leading Federal agency in Minnesota that collects and
       interprets water-resource data and information used by resource
   managers, planners, and the general public. To define the availability
     of water for public, irrigation, and industrial supplies, the USGS
      monitors streamflow, lake levels, and ground-water levels at many
     locations and has studied numerous aquifers in Minnesota (fig. 1).
         These studies have mapped and quantified water supplies for
        Minneapolis, St. Paul, Rochester, Moorhead, and other cities.
      Typically, the studies describe the effects of present and future
   ground-water withdrawals on the levels and quality of ground water and
                                  streams.

       Some specific uses of the USGS studies by cities, counties, and
    regional groups include development of ground-water protection plans,
     enhancement of water-supply systems, and evaluation of the possible
    effects of urban development. Some study results were instrumental in
     helping water-resource managers evaluate the vulnerability of local
   ground-water resources to contamination. Tribal officials of the Grand
     Portage Indian Reservation used results of a USGS study to develop
          alternative community water supplies from Lake Superior.
          ________________________________________________________

                                Water Quality
       Expansion of urban and industrialized areas and development of
   agricultural resources during the past 50 years have adversely affected
    some water resources. State and local water managers and the citizens
    of Minnesota are concerned about the effects of human activity on the
     quality of Minnesota's streams and ground water. There is increased
    emphasis on relating land use to effects on water quality of streams
      and aquifers, not only within a drainage basin, but in downstream
   basins as well. Consequently, many of the most recent requests for USGS
     assistance have been related to water-quality issues. Of particular
    interest to water managers are the water-quality effects of applying
               nutrients and pesticides to agricultural crops.

   To determine the quality of water in Minnesota's streams and lakes, the
    USGS maintains 4 surface-water-quality stations, 2 sediment stations,
      12 lake stations, and 1 precipitation station. The USGS also has
    completed numerous studies of ground-water quality. The USGS studies
      water quality at scales that range from a farm field (fig. 2) to
     regional drainage basins in the 12-State Midwest Corn Belt. Ongoing
     regional studies of water quality cover most of the major drainage
    basins in Minnesota. A study of the Minnesota River Basin determined
   how suspended sediment, agricultural chemicals, and bacteria impair use
    of the river water. The effects of conventional and improved farming
     practices on water quality are being examined in several farm-field
   studies. The results of one study have shown that as much as one-third
    of the nitrogen applied to a typical corn crop in sandy soils reaches
    the ground water. The USGS also is studying the environmental effects
       of an oil spill near Bemidji that is similar to other sites of
     contamination across the Nation. The results of this study may help
         reduce the costs of cleaning oil-contaminated ground water.
                                  figure 2
     Figure 2. Irrigating a corn field (click to view full-sized image).

    The results of USGS water-quality studies provide water managers with
   essential information needed to make ground-water management decisions
    throughout Minnesota. State regulatory agencies are using the results
    of USGS studies to develop new agricultural best-management practices
    for farmers to reduce stream and ground-water contamination. The USGS
       is evaluating hydrologic changes due to changes in agricultural
       practices, such as adding vegetative and woody buffer strips in
    cropland watercourses. Tribal officials used study results to develop
   plans to close existing landfills, to site new landfills, to assess the
    health of a large lake, to evaluate mercury contamination of a major
     river, to assess nitrate contamination of ground- and surface-water
         resources from a large feedlot operation, and to develop a
   pesticide-control ordinance. Networks of USGS monitoring wells in many
   of the aquifers in Minnesota are now used by State and local groups to
                           monitor water quality.
          ________________________________________________________

                      National Water-Quality Assessment
   A critical factor in understanding water quality is the ability to make
       comparisons among different locations through time. Nationally
        consistent and comparable information is needed to make valid
   statements about regional and national water-quality conditions now and
     in the future. Assessments are needed that identify the natural and
     human factors that affect the quality of the Nation's surface- and
     ground-water resources. The USGS National Water-Quality Assessment
           (NAWQA) Program was established to address these needs.

    NAWQA studies in the Red River of the North and the Upper Mississippi
      River Basins investigate nonpoint- and point-source water-quality
    issues in Minnesota and adjacent States. Within the Red River of the
   North Basin, the quality of water in streams and surficial aquifers is
      dependent on geology, soils, and hydrology. Only small amounts of
    agriculturally applied pesticides and nutrients have reached streams
     and shallow ground water. Streams draining areas with much cropland
    have the highest concentrations of nutrients. Although differences in
   fish communities appear to be governed by natural environment factors,
       chemicals associated with modern industrial sources were widely
             detected in fish and stream sediment in the basin.

    The results of sampling in the Upper Mississippi River Basin suggest
   that urban use contributes to elevated concentrations of nutrients and
   several pesticides and synthetic organic compounds in ground water and
    streams. Nutrient concentrations in streams and rivers generally are
    related to land use, and concentrations are greatest in the St. Croix
   River, a National Scenic Waterway. The results of the NAWQA study along
      the St. Croix National Scenic Waterway (fig. 3) will benefit the
    National Park Service in managing this scenic recreational area. The
       NAWQA studies are prompting cooperation among State agencies in
      Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin and various Provincial and
        Federal agencies in Canada to consider consistent, basin-wide
    approaches to monitoring water quality in the Red River of the North
                   and the Upper Mississippi River Basins.

                   Interaction of Ground Water and Streams
      The quantity and quality of streamflows in most of Minnesota are
    controlled by ground water during periods of low rainfall. State and
       local agencies are concerned about the effects of ground-water
      withdrawals on streamflow and stream-water quality. There also is
     concern that contamination within the aquifers or the streams could
   adversely affect public water supplies. Water managers can benefit from
    additional information about how streams are affected by ground-water
   withdrawals from adjacent aquifers and about how poor water quality in
                       these aquifers affects streams.

   The USGS has studied the interaction of ground water and streamflow at
    several sites in Minnesota. One study found that, during the 1988-89
      drought, the Mississippi River did not lose water to the adjacent
   ground-water system. The city of Minneapolis and the U.S. Army Corps of
    Engineers used results of this study to plan for future droughts. The
     USGS is studying interaction of the Rock River with the surrounding
     alluvial aquifer because sources of contamination to the river are
    present upstream from ground-water-supply wells in Luverne. State and
    local water managers are benefiting from significant project results
   about how ground-water quality is affected as a result of inducing flow
    from the Rock River into the aquifer, which is one of the largest and
     most productive alluvial aquifers in southwestern Minnesota. Recent
     USGS work in the Red River of the North Basin used chemical dating
       methods to determine the age of water in a shallow aquifer. The
   youngest water was near the surface of the aquifer, which also had the
   highest concentration of nitrate. The results have strong implications
    for nitrate transport in ground water, and the results may be useful
   for resource managers and planners for devising ground-water protection
                                 strategies.
          ________________________________________________________

                                  Wetlands
    Wetlands are an ecologically important but disappearing component of
     the natural landscape. Wetlands provide habitat for many species of
    plants and animals that would not exist otherwise. Minnesota has lost
        about 50 percent (8 million acres) of its wetlands since the
   mid-1800's, primarily from draining for agricultural purposes. The loss
       of wetlands can cause flooding, soil erosion, and water-quality
                                  problems.

   The USGS is studying how existing and restored wetlands in agricultural
      and other landscapes can store flood water, settle suspended soil
      particles, and alter or remove fertilizer and pesticides by plant
   uptake and microbial action. The USGS studies provide water managers in
        Federal and State agencies with a better understanding of how
     efficiently restored wetlands can reduce flooding and improve water
    quality. Such information will help water managers identify locations
   where wetland preservation and restoration can strike the best balance
                between ecological and economic imperatives.

      Coastal wetlands of Lake Superior protect the drinking water and
        shoreline communities of Minnesota. Many processes have been
     interacting to cause the deterioration of Lake Superior's wetlands
    since the glaciers melted. Histories of wetlands along the Minnesota
   coast are included in a geographic information system map that is being
    prepared for Lake Superior. Use of the map to monitor the changes in
    the wetlands through time will provide a predictive tool for land-use
      planners, political jurisdictions having to sort out conflicting
     best-management practices, and scientists trying to understand the
                     geological limits of biodiversity.
          ________________________________________________________

                         Hydrologic Data Collection
     Hydrologic data are needed for hazard warning, hydroelectric power,
      irrigation, management, operation, planning, pollution abatement,
    water-resource development, water supply, and wildlife management. To
   address the needs of water managers and the citizens of Minnesota, the
    USGS operated 170 daily- or partial-record streamflow-gaging stations
   in 1997 (fig. 4). Data from these stations are added to a national data
                       base each year for easy access.
          ________________________________________________________

                             Floods and Droughts
   Floods throughout the State threaten lives and property, annually cause
      millions of dollars in property damage and remediation costs, and
   disrupt commerce. The damage to bridges and other structures caused by
   channel scour or migration during a flood can cost millions of dollars.
   Because many of Minnesota's cities are adjacent to rivers, knowledge of
   probable flood discharges and river elevations is needed for designing
              new bridges or near-stream housing developments.
                                  figure 4

                                   image).

   The 1988-89 drought and the 1993 flood (fig. 5) are two recent natural
      disasters that illustrate the need for the long-term, consistent
       hydrologic information obtained by the USGS. During the 1988-89
       drought, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources required
   continuous streamflow information throughout the State to protect fish
   and guard against excessive water use. In addition, USGS data were used
   by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to manage and operate their locks,
   dams, and reservoirs and were used by many cities to manage their water
    supplies and sewage-treatment plants. During the 1993 flood, the U.S.
      Weather Service depended on the USGS for accurate and continuous
   water-flow data to forecast flooding and prevent or minimize damage to
                        public and private property.

                             Topographic Mapping
      Among the most popular and versatile products of the USGS are its
       topographic maps at the scale of 1:24,000 (one inch on the map
    represents 2,000 feet on the ground). This scale is useful for civil
   engineering, land-use planning, natural resource monitoring, and other
    technical applications. Minnesota is covered by 1,725 of these maps,
     which have long been favorites with the general public for outdoor
    uses, including hiking, camping, exploring, and back-country fishing
   expeditions. Since 1991, Minnesota's Land Management Information Center
   (LMIC) has cooperated with the USGS to update more than 100 topographic
                               maps (fig. 6).

     The USGS has produced statewide coverage of digital raster graphics
   (DRG's), through cooperation with other agencies. These products can be
   as used an accurate base for a geographic information system. The DRG's
      are available for all 1:24,000-, 1:100,000-, and 1:250,000-scale
                       topographic maps in the State.

       The USGS and LMIC have cooperated to produce statewide digital
    orthophoto quads (DOQ's). These digital images provide a ``snapshot''
   of the Earth's surface that has the accuracy of a topographic map. The
     DOQ data are available for most counties in the State on CD-ROM's.
     Also, the USGS has produced digital elevation models that cover the
                          State at 1:24,000 scale.

     The Department of the Interior's Federal Geographic Data Committee
   (FGDC) and the State of Minnesota have actively participated to promote
      data sharing in the State. The FGDC has recognized the Minnesota
    Governor's Council on Geographic Information (GCGI) as a cooperating
   partner in developing of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure. The
    FGDC also awarded a grant to the LMIC, the GCGI, and the Metropolitan
   Council of the Twin Cities as part of a Framework Demonstration Project
              Program to assess multipurpose data requirements.

                     Lake Superior Shoreline Submergence
     The Lake Superior shoreline in Minnesota and other areas is slowly
   sinking as a result of residual uplift of the outlet following glacier
   retreat 9,800 years ago. The lake level is controlled by the outlet at
   Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan; the outlet is rising more rapidly than most
    other points along the shore. Consequently, the lake level is rising
   about 1 inch per decade near Duluth where the Lake has risen as much as
    18 feet. Submerged wetlands and forests are evident below the present
     lake level. Rising lake levels attributable to uplift at the outlet
     will continue to inundate low-lying areas and river mouths, expand
     wetlands, and contribute to erosion of exposed and erodible shores.
    Engineers and water managers in Duluth, and elsewhere along the Lake
    Superior shoreline, will benefit from results of this study in making
                            management decisions.

                      Earth Science Information Centers
    The Earth Science Information Centers (ESIC's) provide information to
         the public about USGS programs, products, and technological
   developments. The ESIC in St. Paul was established under a cooperative
    agreement with the LMIC. The University of Minnesota's Wilson Library
       in Minneapolis also is a State ESIC. As part of a national ESIC
        network, these offices provide information on topics such as
       cartography, geography, digital data, remote sensing, geology,
   geophysics, geochemistry, hydrology, geohydrology, aerial photography,
                                and land use.
