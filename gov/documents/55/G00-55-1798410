      NIS-4 is a design-to-completion science and engineering group that
      develops and produces sensors, instruments, and systems for
      applications requiring advanced monitoring, detection, and evaluation
      technology.

      NIS-4 develops high-quality, reliable instruments and systems for
      unattended, stable, long-term, failure-free operation in
      high-radiation, high-temperature, high-pressure, or caustic-fluid
      environments such as deep wells. An integrated engineering approach
      permits close interactions among the scientists, the modeling and
      analysis personnel for sensor device physics, the photonics engineers
      associated with the optical data acquisition system, and the
      electronics and mechanical engineers. NIS-4 has developed more than 400
      instruments and systems from design to completion with no significant
      failures.
