   Program aims to reduce injuries to teens working in fast-food
   restaurants; Yakima first in line for safety workshop

   The Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) and the Washington
   Restaurant Association (WRA) are launching a joint program to reduce
   injuries to teen workers in fast-food restaurants throughout the state.

   It will begin in the Yakima area, with a Jan. 23 safety-training
   workshop for restaurant managers and supervisors.

   The statewide program will focus on preventing slips, falls, cuts,
   burns and sprains, which account for more than 85 percent of teen
   injuries in restaurants. Participating quick-service restaurants will
   be asked to implement new safety procedures, send managers and
   supervisors to safety-training classes, conduct regular crew safety
   meetings and place stickers on equipment prohibited for use by teens.

   "With aggressive support from employers and the Washington Restaurant
   Association, we're convinced we can continue to see a significant
   reduction in teen injuries," said Gary Moore, director of L&I. "Making
   our workplaces safer should be a comforting goal for teens, their
   parents and their employers."

   The teen-safety initiative was begun in the restaurant industry because
   it employs 50 percent of teenage workers.

   "Many young people get their first job in our industry and go on to
   have wonderful careers in food service," said Gene Vosberg, WRA
   president. "We want that first experience to be positive and
   injury-free, and this program provides a significant new way to reach
   that goal."

   Using workers' compensation claims data to identify a workplace-safety
   issue and then addressing the problem in collaboration with private
   industry is a growing new direction for L&I.

   "In this case, workers will benefit from reduced injuries," said Moore.
   "For employers, not only do they have the potential of reducing their
   workers' compensation costs as reportable injuries decrease, but they
   also will benefit from the goodwill of employees and customers who
   appreciate an emphasis on safety."

   L&I and the WRA began developing a joint program last year that
   included a three-month teen-safety pilot project in Thurston County.
   Results of the program involving about two dozen restaurants were
   encouraging enough to expand the program statewide.

   Employers wanting more information about the Yakima workshop or the
   overall program should call L&I's Mary Miller at 360-902-6041.
