   Publication of Federal Register notice:

   The Commission has approved publication of a Federal Register notice
   announcing changes in the two threshold figures that define when it is
   unlawful for an individual to serve as an officer or director of two or
   more competing corporations. Under the new thresholds, effective
   immediately, Section 8 of the Clayton Act is applicable to such
   arrangements (with certain exceptions) if each of two companies has
   capital, surplus, and undivided profits in excess of $18,193,000, and
   the competitive sales of each corporation exceed $1,819,300.

   As detailed in the notice, which is also posted on the Commission's Web
   site, Section 8 of the Clayton Act charges the FTC with preventing and
   eliminating unlawful interlocking directorates. A 1990 amendment to
   Section 8 requires the FTC to adjust the thresholds that trigger the
   prohibition - originally set at $10 million and $1 million,
   respectively - each year, based on the change in the Gross National
   Product.

   The Commission vote to adjust the threshold levels and announce the
   changes in the Federal Register was 5-0. (FTC File No. P859910; staff
   contact is Gabriel Dagen, Bureau of Competition, 202-326-2573.)
