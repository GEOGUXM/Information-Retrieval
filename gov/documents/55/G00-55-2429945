USGS Annual Hydrologic Data Report of Pennsylvania

   The annual hydrologic data report of Pennsylvania is one of a series of
   annual reports that document hydrologic data gathered from the U.S.
   Geological Survey's surface-water and ground-water data-collection
   networks in each State, Puerto Rico, and the Trust Territories. These
   records of streamflow, ground-water levels, and quality of water
   provide the hydrologic information needed by State, local, and Federal
   agencies, and the private sector for developing and managing our
   Nation's land and water resources. Hydrologic data for Pennsylvania are
   contained in 3 volumes.
     * Volume 1. Delaware River Basin
     * Volume 2. Susquehanna and Potomac River Basins
     * Volume 3. Ohio River and St. Lawrence River Basins

   Water Year 1999 is the first Pennsylvania annual hydrologic data report
   to be made available on the internet. Previous water data reports,
   beginning with the 1971 water year, are for sale as paper copy from the
   National Technical Information Service, U. S. Department of Commerce,
   Springfield, Virginia 22161.
