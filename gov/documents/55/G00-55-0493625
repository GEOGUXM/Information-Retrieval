 Hacker Into United States Courts Information System Pleads Guilty

 United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Roscoe C. Howard,
 Jr., announced today that United States District Court Judge Richard
Roberts accepted the guilty plea of Nicholas Mamich, 44, of Bowdoinham,
 Maine, to one felony count of Fraud in Connection with Computers, in
   violation of United States Code, Title 18, Section 1030(a)(2)(B).
  Assistant U.S. Attorney Miriam Smolen informed the Court that this
charge arose from Nicholas Mamichs conduct in hacking numerous times
into the computer system which houses the United States Federal Courts
docket and electronic filing information, including the computer system
which houses the information for the Court in front of which he pleaded
                                guilty.
 The Public Access to Court Electronic Records, (PACER) is a computer
   system operated by the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts, a government agency, which maintains Court docket information,
 electronically stored case related documents, case statistic reports,
 and other related information. PACER allows the public to access the
   stored information, and, with an authorized password, to print or
download the information for a fee of several cents per computer page.
 Each District Court maintains its own PACER server which houses that
 districts data. PACER may be accessed from a kiosk in an individual
   courthouse, or off-site through the Internet. PACER has a billing
 program which tracks the charges an authorized PACER user accrues for
                 downloading or printing information.
  Between approximately May 2000 and November 2000, from his home in
  Bowdoinham, Maine, Nicholas Mamich gained unauthorized access to 65
   PACER computer servers belonging to United States District Courts
around the country on several hundred occasions and downloaded millions
  of pages of data to his personal computer. Mamich devised a program
that placed hidden files on the PACER servers which bypassed the PACER
 billing program, so that no charges would accrue. The Administrative
Office of the United States Courts estimated that it incurred expenses
  of at least $40,000 to discover and repair the damage caused by the
  defendants hacks into the PACER servers. The system has now been
              configured to prevent this type of conduct.
   The specific charge to which Mamich pleaded guilty focused on his
conduct in hacking into the PACER server of the United States District
   Court of the District of Columbia over twenty times from May 2000
through October 2000, and downloading information without charge valued
                          at least at $5,000.
As a result of his plea today, Nicholas Mamich could be sentenced up to
five years imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, or both. Mr. Mamich has also
  agreed to pay full restitution for the damage prior to sentencing.
              Sentencing is scheduled for March 12, 2002.
     United States Attorney Howard commended the assistance of the
  Administrative Office of the United States Courts, and praised the
  investigative work of Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent
   John T. Curran. Mr. Howard also commended Assistant U.S. Attorney
                Miriam Smolen who prosecuted the case.
