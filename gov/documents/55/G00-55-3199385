   Specially Constructed Vehicles- Emission Control

   What's New?

   Effective January 1, 2002, the first 500 owners to apply for original
   registration of specially constructed passenger vehicles and pickup
   trucks may choose whether smog requirements that apply to their
   vehicles are based on the engine model year or the vehicle model year.

   If your application is one of the first 500 received by the Department
   of Motor Vehicles, a numbered Specially Constructed Vehicle (SPCNS)
   Certificate of Sequence will be issued for your vehicle.

   NOTE: Due to the limited number of SPCNS Certificates of Sequence
   available, you may wish to submit your application for registration in
   person at a local DMV office.
            _____________________________________________________

     As of close of business on January 29, 2002, 461 of 500 sequence
     certificates are unassigned and available.
            _____________________________________________________

   How To Apply for Registration of a Specially Constructed Vehicle
    1. First, verify that your vehicle meets the definition of a specially
       constructed vehicle according to Vehicle Code Section 580. If your
       vehicle does not fit the description, this information does not
       apply.
    2. Visit DMV to begin the application process.
    3. Contact the California Highway Patrol (CHP) for an appointment to
       have your vehicle verified.
    4. To contact the Bureau of Automotive Repair (BAR) for an appointment
       to have your vehicle smog inspection performed by a BAR referee,
       check BAR's Contact Page.

     NOTE: Have the Vehicle Identification Number (CHP verification) and
     the SPCNS Certificate of Sequence number available when scheduling
     your appointment with the BAR Referee.
    5. Resubmit your application to DMV to complete the registration
       process.

     NOTE: All documents-including the original (or the certified copy)
     of the SPCNS certificate, vehicle verification, and BAR Referee
     Datasheet-are part of your registration documentation and must be
     submitted to DMV to complete the registration process.

   Additional Information

   Senate Bill 100, passed during the 2001 legislative session, was
   chaptered into law with an effective date of January 1, 2002. The bill
   added section 44017.4 to the Health and Safety Code. This section
   annually allows only the first 500 SPCNS vehicle applicants to choose
   whether their vehicle is inspected by the BAR smog referee based on
   engine or vehicle model year.
