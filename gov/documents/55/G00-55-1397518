                  Welcome to the "America's Coastline Album".

      Enjoy this sampling of America's 95,000 miles of coastline and the
     adjacent coastal regions. NOAA and its predecessor agencies have
     been observing, studying, and surveying America's coastline for
     nearly 200 years. Indeed, the Coast Survey, the forerunner of all
     United States science agencies, was formed specifically to chart the
     United States coastline and the immediate offshore waters.

     The coastline pictures that you will see in this album have come
     from personnel associated with virtually all elements of NOAA
     including latter-day Coast Surveyors, fisheries scientists, oceanic
     and atmospheric researchers, weather observers, and even NOAA
     librarians. Although most images are relatively recent, there are
     sketches and drawings dating back to the early Nineteenth Century
     found within this album. Come join us now and view the waves and
     flying spray, rocky shores and sandy beaches, marshes and mangroves,
     and seaside villages and great port cities that collectively make up
     America's Coastline.
