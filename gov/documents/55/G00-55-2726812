   II 107TH CONGRESS 1ST SESSION S. 425 To establish the Rocky Flats
   National Wildlife Refuge in the State of Colorado, and for other
   purposes. IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES MARCH 1, 2001 Mr. ALLARD
   (for himself and Mr. CAMPBELL) introduced the following bill; which was
   read twice and referred to the Committee on Armed Services A BILL To
   establish the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge in the State of
   Colorado, and for other purposes. 1 Be it enacted by the Senate and
   House of Representa- 2 tives of the United States of America in
   Congress assembled, 3 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 4 This Act may be cited
   as the ``Rocky Flats National 5 Wildlife Refuge Act of 2001''. 6 SEC.
   2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 7 (a) FINDINGS.-Congress finds the following:
   8 (1) The Federal Government, through the 9 Atomic Energy Commission,
   acquired the Rocky 10 Flats site in 1951 and began operations there in
   2 1 1952. The site remains a Department of Energy fa- 2 cility. Since
   1992, the mission of the Rocky Flats 3 site has changed from the
   production of nuclear 4 weapons components to cleanup and closure in a
   5 manner that is safe, environmentally and socially re- 6 sponsible,
   physically secure, and cost-effective. 7 (2) The site has generally
   remained undisturbed 8 since its acquisition by the Federal Government.
   9 (3) The State of Colorado is experiencing in- 10 creasing growth and
   development, especially in the 11 metropolitan Denver Front Range area
   in the vicin- 12 ity of the Rocky Flats site. That growth and devel- 13
   opment reduces the amount of open space and there- 14 by diminishes for
   many metropolitan Denver com- 15 munities the vistas of the striking
   Front Range 16 mountain backdrop. 17 (4) Some areas of the site contain
   contamina- 18 tion and will require further remediation. The na- 19
   tional interest requires that the ongoing cleanup and 20 closure of the
   entire site be completed safely, effec- 21 tively, and without
   unnecessary delay and that the 22 site thereafter be retained by the
   United States and 23 managed so as to preserve the value of the site
   for 24 open space and wildlife habitat. *S 425 IS 3 1 (5) The Rocky
   Flats site provides habitat for 2 many wildlife species, including a
   number of threat- 3 ened and endangered species, and is marked by the 4
   presence of rare xeric tallgrass prairie plant commu- 5 nities.
   Establishing the site as a unit of the National 6 Wildlife Refuge
   System will promote the preserva- 7 tion and enhancement of those
   resources for present 8 and future generations. 9 (b) PURPOSE.-The
   purpose of this Act is to provide 10 for the establishment of the Rocky
   Flats site as a national 11 wildlife refuge while creating a process
   for public input 12 on refuge management and ensuring that the site is
   thor- 13 oughly and completely cleaned up. 14 SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. 15
