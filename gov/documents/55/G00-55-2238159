How to Access the ZOOM cvs Repository

To obtain read-only access to the ZOOM cvs repository (which allows you to check
out and update ZOOM packages):

     * setenv CVSROOT
       :pserver:anonymous@zoomcvs.fnal.gov:/usr/people/cvsuser/repository
     * In your home directory, the file .cvspass must contain the line
:pserver:anonymous@zoomcvs.fnal.gov:/usr/people/cvsuser/repository A+.(=0BB&

   This provides access even if the local system does not use Kerberos for
   secure logins.

   To obtain write privilege for a specific ZOOM package, which goes via
   the CVSROOT cvsuser@zoomcvs.fnal.gov:/usr/people/cvsuser/repository,
   please contact the zoom support group.

   Write access to the ZOOM repository does require Kerberos.

List of ZOOM-supported platforms: A platform means some combination of specific
hardware, operating system, and compiler.

The list of mandated platforms for ZOOM to support is determined by the Run II
Computing Steering Committee, and approved requests from the Run II experiments.
All ZOOM products at beta release or later should work on all these supported
platforms.

Current supported platforms are:

     * KAI compiler (KCC 3.4) under IRIX 6.2 and higher
     * KAI compiler (KCC 4.0d) under IRIX 6.2 and higher
     * KAI compiler (KCC 3.4) under Linux
     * KAI compiler (KCC 4.0d) under Linux
     * KAI compiler (KCC 3.4) on Sun
     * KAI compiler (KCC 4.0d) on Sun
     * GNU compiler (gcc 2.95.2) under IRIX 6.2 and higher
     * GNU compiler (gcc 2.95.2) under Linux
     * Microsoft compiler (VC++ 6.0) under NT4 and NT5 with Cygwin
     * Microsoft compiler (VC++ 6.0) under NT5 with Cygwin
     * GNU compiler (gcc 2.95.2) under NT5 with Cygwin

   Four platforms were specified initially, all for SGI machines:

   As of Dec. 1, 1997, the following x86 PC architecture platforms were
   added by the Committee:
     * KAI compiler (KCC) under Linux
     * Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 compiler under Windows NT
          + NT-specific distribution is coordinated with SoftRelTools and
            relies on the cygwin "Unix shell" product.
          Due to problems with interactions among SRT, ISOcxx, CYGWIN and
            NT, we are presently not capable of supporting ZOOM packages
            on NT at a level compatible with D0 usage.
          + The current NT compiler version in common use is 6.0, and
            support is targetted for that rather than 5.0.

   As of June 1, 1998, the committee has eliminated gcc from the list, at
   least until some variant properly supports namespaces. The ZOOM
   products generally still work with gcc as long as ZM_USE_NAMESPACES is
   not defined and the user makes no use of namespaces.

   OSF/1 for the Alpha architecture using the KAI compiler was informally
   added to this list but no longer is actively being pursued.

                                  [bar.gif]

     __________________________________________________________________

   [blueball.gif] Allocator module (Walter Brown)
   A simple allocator that greatly speed up code that frequently builds up
       many std::vectors of objects. The Zoom Allocator package provides a
       memory-management subsystem. This subsystem has an interface whose
       design follows the model of the std::allocator class, while
       featuring significantly improved performance for dynamic memory
       management. This performance benefit is achieved by takes advantage
       of known fixed-size properties to reduce the average per-allocation
       performance overhead, and using the strategies of recycling deleted
       storage and bulk allocation.

   [blueball.gif] CLHEP module (Mark Fischler)
   A common version of the CLHEP library, with all sub-packages compilable
       on the ZOOM-supported platforms. CLHEP is a collection of routines
       written by physicists around the world, and an organization for
       assigning "editor" responsibility to those packages.
       For ZOOM purposes, we categorize the sub-packages that make up
       CLHEP by level of support:

     * PRESENT -- These have been tried out on each of the ZOOM platforms
       and put into a form where they compile and build with no apparent
       problems. However, no claim is made as to quality, applicability,
       or correctness, and no responsibility is taken for bug fixes
       (beyond reporting bugs to package editors).
     * VALIDATED -- These are components of CLHEP that ZOOM recommends Run
       II users employ wherever needed. Beyond compiling, they have been
       validated for at least rudimentary correctness against ZOOM (and/or
       other) tests. ZOOM will not be creating packages that duplicate the
       semantics of these validated parts of CLHEP.

   [blueball.gif] CLHEP Random validation (John Marraffino and Mark
   Fischler)
   Validation against randomness test suite, completion of set of
       distributions, and additional random engines.

   Page is not up to date with regard to validation of distributions.

   [blueball.gif] CLHEP StdHepC++ (Lynn Garren)
   StdHep contains a set of translation routines which convert Herwig,
       Jetset, Isajet, or QQ events to and from the standard HEP event
       format. StdHep also contains utility routines to work with the
       HEPEVT common block and a set of I/O routines.
       StdHepC++ implements that functionallity in C++, and takes
       advantage of the object-oriented nature to provide conceptually
       clean interfaces.

   [blueball.gif] ErrLogEx module (Mark Fischler)
   Tools involving both the Exceptions and the ErrorLogger packages. For
       example, a way to route messages produced by ZMexceptions, through
       the output destinations associated with an ErrorLog.

   [blueball.gif] ErrorLogger module (Mark Fischler)
   Flexible multi-destination logging and statistics facility designed for
       use in the D0 and CDF frameworks. Central control of logging to
       multiple destination logs, with uniform formatting, filtering by
       severity level at each destination, throttling of multiple
       appearences of messages, and error statistics summaries. Automatic
       appending of time, module/package, and context (run/event)
       information

   [blueball.gif] Exceptions module (Mark Fischler)
   A mechanism to permit, under user control, selective ignoring,
       handling, and throwing of any exceptions potentially raised by ZOOM
       modules. Selected features include:

     * a standard handler for exception objects, while permitting
       installation of custom handlers
     * a standard mechanism for logging, to user-specified destinations,
       both raised exceptions and user-generated explicit log messages
     * user-selectable logging policies (e.g., by exception severity),
       while permitting installation of custom loggers
     * an extensible design to allow users to define, handle, and log
       their own exception objects via the same machinery used by
       ZOOM-generated exceptions
     * a base class and special logger to connect user or ZOOM exceptions
       to the ErrorLogger package, so that statistics and multiple
       destinations are available

   [blueball.gif] HepTuple module (Philippe Canal)
   An interface to several underlying HEP histogramming and Ntuple
       collection packages including HBOOK, Histoscope, and ROOT.

   [blueball.gif] ISOcxx module (Walter Brown)
   The goals of the ISOcxx C++ Portability package are to:

     * document known features and defects of C++ development environments
       for supported Run II platforms
     * provide, to the extent possible, C++ standard-compliant fixes and
       workarounds that serve as cures for known defects' consequences
     * provide a framework for testing known defects and for testing
       compliance code proposed as cures for defects
     * provide a centralized source of information regarding known
       problems and possible cures for various platforms
     * provide a framework for easily adding newly-discovered defects and
       new (or improved) defect cures to the package

   The package is designed to be used independently but, for Run II
   projects, interfaces with the Fermilab SoftRelTools (SRT) package for
   environment definitions.

   [blueball.gif] LinearAlgebra module (Leo Michelotti)
   Matrix manipulations, with specific attention paid to efficient
       operations for small-matrix cases.

   Currently in beta release, with the following
       restrictions/dependencies:

     * math functions (like cos, sin) have not been implemented
     * does not use the Exception package yet
     * not available on gcc yet due to problems with dynamic_cast
     * requires ZMutility v0.02

   [blueball.gif] PhysicsVectors (3- and 4-Vectors) module (Mark Fischler)
   3-vector and Lorentz Vector concepts commonly used in High Energy
       Physics calculations; boosts, rotations, invariant masses, and so
       forth.
       Now these classes are derived from CLHEP Vector classes (which have
       been given the added ZOOM capabilities).

   [blueball.gif] SIunits (SI Library of Unit-Based Computation) module
   (Walter Brown)
   Types representing quantities with basic and derived units (such as
       Length and Energy), and dimension analysis checking when working
       with these numerical quantities.
       Implements all concepts recognized by the Systeme International
       d'Unites (SI) and a comprehensive set of other terms and constants
       found in various physics texts.
       Dimension checking is done at compile time and incurs no run-time
       overhead or increase in memory for these quantities.
       Code compatibility but without strong dimension checking on VC++ /
       Windows NT.
       The SIunits package has been placed into KITS and is available
       through FermiTools.

   [blueball.gif] SpecialFunctions (GNU Scientific Library) module (John
   Marafino)
   Based on the Special Functions section of the Gnu Scientific Library,
       this provides various functions such as Bessel functions, Legendre
       polynomials, Elliptic integrals, and so forth.

   [blueball.gif] ZMtools module (Walter Brown)
   A collection of useful codes contributed by non-ZOOM physicists
       (generally at FNAL) who have solved specific problems that others
       may share. Also includes codes developed by ZOOM as needed
       auxiliaries, which may be useful to physicists in their own right.
       assertN.h

   A set of graded assert macros.
       Related macros that employ the ErrorLogger mechanism are given in
       ErrorLogger/ELassertN.h .

   Block
   Simple templated class that behaves like an STL container but can also
       be block-initialized like a fixed-size native C++ array.

   HolderPtr
   Simple templated class that can serve as a pointer to an object, with
       the property that when the HolderPtr is copied, it creates its own
       copy of the object pointed to as well.

   IteratorFilter
   Provides a simple means of selecting certain of a container's members
       while traversing (iterating through) the container.

   ZMexAugmented
   Classes implementing "augmented ZMexceptions" which are the ZOOM
       Exceptions that utilize the ErrorLogger output (and routing and
       filtering and statistics...)

   ZMtimer
   Simple timer classes, providing semantics similar to those in
       Tools.h++, and more. (This builds on work independently contributed
       by Randy Herber and Fritz Bartlett.)

   [blueball.gif] ZMutility module
   (Walter Brown)
   A collection of auxiliary headers and small routines that were needed
       for other ZOOM packages, many of which may also be of use to users.
       FixedTypes

   Uniform nomenclature for 32, 64, and 128-bit floats, and 1, 2, 4, and
       8-byte integers, along with defines allowing the compiler to use
       the appropriate types for Float8, Int2, and so forth.

   Reference-counting
   Counter and handle classes, useful for general-purpose
       reference-counting. (Inspired by code published separately by
       Bjarne Stroustrup and Andrew Koenig.)

                                  [bar.gif]

Modules under active development:

   Work toward the following modules has begun. Information on each is
   maintained by the indicated person.

   [blueball.gif] StdHep (Lynn Garren)
   Bridge among the various Hep simulation and event generation packages.
       StdHepC++ is already in CLHEP, but is to undergo major improvements
       in terms of object oriented approach.

     * A design for the ParticleData and related classes has been done,
       and initial codingis underway.
     * The instance code will be restructured using the concept of a
       container class representing a Directed Acyclic Graph. Attempts are
       being made to coordinate this with code developed by HepMC rfor
       ATLAS.

   [blueball.gif] Coordination with CLHEP (M. Fischler)
   Several ZOOM packages are being incorporated into (Exceptions,
       ErrorLogger) CLHEP for more general availability. PhysicsVectors
       has been merged with the CLHEP Vector package.
       CLHEP has also expressed a desire to merge in ZOOM Exceptions and
       the ErrorLogger, and willingness to coordinate configuration issues
       under the umbrella of the ZOOM ISOcxx package.

                                  [bar.gif]

Possible future modules:

   The following modules were originally intended at some low level of
   priority. These are modules which have been at one point identified as
   possible development targets, but which are for the present not slated
   for being done:

   [blueball.gif] MINUIT++
   A wrapper for MINUIT or some other means of getting a good minimization
       package into the HEP public domain.
       Assuming somebody else in the HEP community does this, ZOOM will
       not have to.

   [blueball.gif] Particle data book data
   Is now part of StdHepC++, which we provide for CLHEP.
