                        SAGE3/Meteor-3M Mission Patch

   The SAGE III/Meteor-3M satellite mission is a joint partnership between
   NASA and the Russian Aviation and Space Agency (RASA). It was initiated
   by the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission in 1994 and extends a long-term
   working relationship between the United States and Russia to understand
   Earth's environment.

   SAGE III was successfully launched onboard a Meteor-3M spacecraft on
   December 10, 2001 at 17:18:57 UTC from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in
   Kazakhstan. The satellite is in a sun-synchronous orbit with an
   ascending node time of about 9 AM.

   The Meteor-3M spacecraft is an advanced model of the Meteor spacecraft
   that was developed over 30 years ago. The payload includes SAGE III and
   other instruments designed to measure temperature and humidity
   profiles, clouds, surface properties, and high energy particles in the
   upper atmosphere.

   The instrument is commanded and controlled by personnel at the SAGE III
   Mission Operations Center at NASA Langley Research Center. Data are
   downlinked twice daily to Wallops Flight Facility and to a Russian
   receiving station. It will be processed and will made available at the
   Langley Research Center's Atmospheric Sciences Data Center.

   Routine measurement operations are expected to begin in March 2002.
