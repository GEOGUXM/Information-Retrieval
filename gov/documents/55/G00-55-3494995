   The Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center (GCMRC), a program of
   the U.S. Geological Survey, convened a science symposium at the Little
   America Hotel in Flagstaff, AZ, on April 26 and 27, 2001. The symposium
   reported on physical, biological, cultural, recreational and economic
   resource studies conducted on the Colorado River ecosystem within Glen
   Canyon National Recreation Area and Grand Canyon National Park. In
   addition, the results of studies during the low steady summer flows in
   2000--conducted primarily to benefit endangered fish--were presented.
