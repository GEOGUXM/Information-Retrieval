                    THE FUTURE FOR SOLID EARTH's WEB SITE
     __________________________________________________________________

   At the Solid Earth's Division Meeting we discussed several problems and
   some positive aspects of our Web Site.

        NAVIGATION: (SEG and NGDC both) Poor navigation which requires a
                user to know our structure to find data and information.
                Navigation styles are inconsistent from division to
                division, and within our own division.

                PHILOSOPHY - We have no guiding philosophy for SEG or NGDC
                to help evolve our web site. What are we trying to do and
                for whom?

                SEARCH CAPABILITIES - Site wide searching a must, but we
                were returning too many hits many of which were
                irrelevant, incorrect, or no longer in existence. A site
                map and good search capability would be an asset.

                APPEARANCE: Many of our pages are out-dated, old style,
                appearance, and capability. Our site varies too much from
                division to division and within a single division. It
                often appears to users as if they have left NGDC and gone
                'elsewhere'. We should have consistent appearance and
                navigation with the division.

                MAINTENANCE: Content is often old, outdated and difficult
                to update. Hard to know which links work and which are
                broken, therefor many broken links.

                BROWSERS: We have to support Navigator 2.0 through the
                latest browsers. This makes some definate demands on what
                we display.

                PROCEDURE ON UPDATING PAGES: We as a division are too
                restrictive in what is posted. We as a division are too
                permissive in what gets posted. The method for review is
                too time consuming and cumbersome.

   At the Division meeting in May, a small group was formed to review
   SEG's web site and make suggestions to improve it. The first meeting of
   many occured on June 11, 1998. We will post the results of these
   meetings from this page to help keep the division up to date on
   developments and progress.
