   Real-time mesoscale model weather forecasts using the non-hydrostatic
   Penn State/NCAR mesoscale model (MM5) are being produced once-daily by
   the Models and Assimilation Team at NSSL/MRAD. This 00 UTC forecast is
   usually available after 08 UTC and data fields are available out to 36
   h. The model grid spacing is set at 32 km.

   The model is initialized using the National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction early eta model forecast fields available at 25 mb vertical
   increments. Boundary conditions also are provided by the eta model
   forecast at 6 h intervals. One of the major differences between this
   version of MM5 and the eta model is that MM5 uses a Kain-Fritsch
   convective parameterization scheme that was developed specifically for
   mesoscale modeling. The scheme includes the effects of downdrafts and
   has been shown to organize convection owing to downdraft processes.

   Since the mission of NSSL is to improve the Nation's severe weather
   warnings and forecasts in order to save lives and reduce property
   damage, the MM5 output fields that we highlight are directed toward a
   depiction of the severe weather threat. Some of the parameters shown
   are experimental.

   The software used to convert from eta model output to MM5 input was
   obtained from the Department of Meteorology at the University of Utah ,
   while the MM5 is maintained by the Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology
   Division at NCAR.
