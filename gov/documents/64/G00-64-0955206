        President Bush to Sign Two-Year Ban on Internet Access Taxes

   By Rob Wells
   Washington, Nov. 16 (Bloomberg) -- President George W. Bush will sign
   legislation banning for two years taxes targeting Internet service
   providers such as America Online and Microsoft Corp.
   ``The Administration believes that government should be promoting
   Internet usage and availability, not discouraging it with access taxes
   and discriminatory taxes,'' the White House said in a statement.
   The comment came shortly before the U.S. Senate approved, by voice
   vote, the Internet tax ban, the same measure the House approved Oct.
   16. Passage came after the Senate rejected an effort to resolve a
   broader dispute on taxing online sales.
   The bill the Senate approved would ban multiple and discriminatory
   taxes that target the Internet, such as levies on e-mail traffic or
   data usage. The bill also would ban taxes on Internet service
   providers.
   ``The bottom line is that consumers know that for the next two years,
   the Internet will not be singled out for unfair tax treatment,'' said
   Representative Christopher Cox, Republican of California.
