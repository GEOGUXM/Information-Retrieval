  Working Capital Guarantee Program

   E
   x-Im Bank's Working Capital Guarantee Program encourages commercial
   lenders to make loans to U.S. businesses for various export-related
   activities.

   The program facilitates the expansion of U.S. exports. It helps small
   and medium-sized businesses that have exporting potential but need
   funds to buy or produce goods, and/or to provide services, for export.
   It may be used to cover working capital loans to a U.S. business if the
   lender shows that the loan would not have been made without Ex-Im
   Bank's guarantee, and Ex-Im Bank determines that the exporter is
   creditworthy.

   The exporter may use the guaranteed financing to:

    1. Purchase finished products for export.
    2. Pay for raw materials, labor and overhead to produce goods and/or
       to provide services for export.
    3. Cover standby letters of credit serving as bid bonds, performance
       bonds, or payment guarantees.
    4. Cover retainages and warranties.
    5. Finance foreign receivables.

   Ex-Im Bank's working capital guarantee covers 90 percent of the loan's
   principal and accrued interest. Guaranteed loans must be fully
   collateralized. Acceptable collateral may include export-related
   inventory, export-related accounts receivable, or other assets.
   Inventory purchased with disbursements under the Ex-Im Bank guaranteed
   loan may be used as collateral, as may the accounts receivable
   generated from the transactions supported. For companies in the service
   sector, costs such as engineering, design, and allocable overhead may
   be treated as collateral. The loan can be structured to finance one or
   more specified transactions, or as a revolving line of credit.

   Exporters must demonstrate a successful track record of past
   performance including at least one full year of operations and a
   positive net worth. Financial statements must show sufficient strength
   to accommodate the requested debt.

   Exporters may apply directly to Ex-Im Bank for a preliminary commitment
   for a guarantee. If approved, the exporter may then approach various
   lenders to secure the most attractive loan package. A preliminary
   commitment is valid for six months. The lender must apply for the final
   commitment.

   Ex-Im Bank imposes no interest rate ceilings or maximum fee
   limitations; however, lenders should take into account that 90 percent
   of the risk is covered by an agency of the U.S. Government and price
   their loans accordingly.

   Ex-Im Bank charges:

    1. A processing fee of $500 with each application for a preliminary
       commitment, $400 of which will be applied toward the Facility Fee
       on the operative final commitment, if any; OR
    2. A processing fee of $100 with each application for a final
       commitment. (No additional fee is charged for conversion of a
       preliminary commitment to a final commitment.)
    3. An up-front Facility Fee of 1.5 percent of the total loan amount,
       based on a one-year loan. (For loans of up to six months, the
       Facility Fee is 0.75 percent of the total loan amount.)

   To expedite processing, Ex-Im Bank has established a City/State
   Program, consisting of state and municipal organizations whose staff
   receive training in Ex-Im Bank programs and can guide the exporter
   through the application process. A listing of the participants in this
   valuable resource is available from Ex-Im Bank.

   Accelerated Processing For Lenders

   Ex-Im Bank offers lenders accelerated processing of requests through
   the Priority Lending Program (PLP) and Delegated Authority Program
   (DA). Lenders must send two people to a three and a half day Ex-Im Bank
   seminar in order to qualify for either of these programs. Under the
   PLP, lenders who have made at least two transactions operative under
   the Working Capital Guarantee Program may submit a complete write-up of
   the exporter and transaction and be given a 10-day turnaround on their
   application. Since most of the work has already been done, Ex-Im Bank
   can make its decision sooner.

   Since October 1994, Ex-Im Bank has given DA to qualified lenders which
   allows them to commit Ex-Im Bank's guarantee as soon as they have made
   their credit decision. No further analysis is done by Ex-Im Bank. As an
   added incentive, Ex-Im Bank allows the lender to retain a portion of
   the Facility Fee. DA is available at four levels, based on prerequisite
   requirements:
