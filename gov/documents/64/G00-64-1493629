   To:      District Superintendents
            Superintendents of Schools
   From:    Kathy A. Ahearn
   Subject: Computer Technology In Schools

    A. Introduction.
       As education moves increasingly from the realm of books and papers
       to instructional technology, questions have arisen about the proper
       use of this new technology. Two critical issues that have emerged
       are commercialism associated with the use of computers and the
       internet in the classroom and equal access to such technology for
       all students, regardless of parents' ability or willingness to pay.
       This memorandum provides a general legal framework within which the
       use of technology should be evaluated. It is not intended to be an
       exhaustive legal analysis of this complex subject. Rather, as with
       any important policy decision, school administrators and boards of
       education should carefully review these issues with the guidance of
       your legal counsel before adopting or implementing technology
       plans.
    B. Commercialism.
       Regents Rules. Part 23 of the Regents Rules prohibits commercialism
       in public schools. Specifically, §23.2 provides that boards of
       education cannot enter into contracts, agreements or arrangements
       in exchange for a promise to permit commercial promotional activity
       on school premises. "Commercial promotional activity" is defined
       as:

     any activity, designed to induce the purchase of a particular
     product or service by students, or to extol the benefits of such
     product or service to students for the purpose of making its
     purchase more attractive, that is conveyed to students
     electronically through such media as, but not limited to, television
     and radio.
       §23.1(b). While the rule does not specifically identify computers
       as a kind of media through which promotional activity is
       prohibited, the Department interprets the rule to include
       computers. This is because the rule does not purport to provide an
       exhaustive list of prohibited marketing tools, stating instead that
       it applies, but is not limited to, television and radio. The rule
       does allow commercial sponsorship, which is distinguished from
       commercial promotional activity as "the sponsorship or the
       underwriting of an activity on school premises which does not
       involve the commercial promotion of a particular product or
       service."
       State Statute. School districts considering entering into
       agreements to obtain technology in exchange for marketing rights or
       advertising on computer screens or school premises should carefully
       examine their statutory authority to do so. Education Law §§1709
       and 1804 set forth the powers of boards of education. As creatures
       of statute, school boards have only those powers expressly conveyed
       upon them pursuant to law (Bassett v. Fish, 75 NY 303 [1878]).
       These powers include, among other things, the authority to enter
       into employment contracts, to accept gifts on behalf of the
       district, and to raise funds through tax levies. In Opinion 79-475,
       the Comptroller of the State of New York held that a school
       district had no authority to raise revenues by selling advertising
       space in the school newsletter. He further noted that "advertising
       is a private enterprise and is not in any manner related to the
       public functions of a school district." The Attorney General has
       also opined that advertising is a private business in which a
       government unit is not authorized to engage, absent specific
       statutory authority. 1973 Opns. Atty. Gen. 51.
       New York State Constitution. The New York State Constitution
       prohibits a gift or loan of school property for private gain. The
       Constitution states that "[n]o county, city, town, village or
       school district shall give or loan any money or property to or in
       aid of any individual, or private corporation or association..."
       N.Y. State Const. Art. VIII, §1. This provision has been
       interpreted to prohibit the use of public property for private
       advertising. (Village in violation of Art. VIII, §1 of the State
       Constitution where it accepted as a gift and then erected on
       village property and buildings laminated signs containing maps of
       the village together with private advertising.) Opns. St. Compt.
       1980, No. 80-735.
       In analyzing Art. VIII, §1, the courts have held that private
       persons may "use" public property where the use is for a public
       purpose and the private benefit is only incidental. See Murphy v.
       Erie County, 28 NY2d 80 (1971). The courts' analysis of "public
       purpose/incidental private benefit" has been adopted by the
       Commissioner in cases where the proposed use of school facilities
       was for a school purpose and the benefit to the private undertaking
       was only incidental. See Matter of Puls, 18 Ed Dept Rep 530 (1979);
       Matter of Jones, 16 id. 156 (1976); Matter of Hoyt, 17 id. 174
       (1977).
       A program that has a combined school and private commercial purpose
       may pass constitutional muster, provided that the private
       commercial benefit is only incidental to the greater school
       purpose. Whether there is a valid "school purpose" and whether the
       private commercial purpose is "incidental" to the school purpose
       depends upon the particular facts presented by the arrangement
       under consideration.
    C. Equal Access.
       A plan to provide computer technology may also implicate issues of
       equal access. Every child is entitled under the State Constitution
       to a free public education. If computers are an integral part of
       the district's instructional program, they should be made available
       equally, to all students in the district's instructional program,
       free of charge. See Matter of Gordon, 14 Ed Dept Rep 358 (1975).
    D. Conclusion.
       Rapidly changing technology will ensure a constant flow of new
       questions and challenges. The Department is engaging these emerging
       issues so that we may provide school districts with additional
       legal and programmatic guidance in the future. Questions on the
       analysis provided herein should be directed to your school
       attorney.
