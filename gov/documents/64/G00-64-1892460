   Purpose of the Simulation:
   To provide the public with an interactive simulation to experience the
   challenges of spacecraft docking

   The space shuttle docking simulation, showcased at the San Jose Tech
   Museum of Innovation's 2001: Destination Space exhibit section, was
   developed by the Smart Systems Research Lab, located at NASA Ames
   Research Center at Moffett Field, CA. This simulation is a simplified
   version of the rendezvous and docking scenario performed by astronauts
   when docking the Space Shuttle to the International Space Station
   (ISS). When the Shuttle docks with the ISS, the operation takes several
   hours and requires precise accuracy.

   An astronaut works in six degrees-of-freedom environment (which means
   he/she has to worry about the x-translation, y-translation,
   z-translation, pitch-rotation, yaw-rotation, and roll-rotation). The
   astronaut uses two separate joysticks to handle all six
   degrees-of-freedom. In this particular simulation, the operating
   scenario has been reduced to three degrees-of-freedom (x-translation,
   z-translation, and roll-rotation) with one joystick. There are also
   orbital mechanic effects in space that make maneuvers more difficult
   (briefly, orbital mechanic effects cause maneuvers to have a slight arc
   because the earth's gravity pulls objects back towards it). Again, to
   simplify matters, the orbital mechanic effects have been neglected in
   this simulation (when you push the joystick forward, in the +z
   direction, the shuttle will just translate forward in the +z
   direction).

   Note however that space is a frictionless environment. If the joystick
   is pushed in any direction, even for just a brief second, the shuttle
   will keep going in that direction unless the joystick is pushed back in
   the opposite direction to counteract the thrust that had been
   initiated. Flying the shuttle in space is very different from driving a
   car or flying a plane. There is no friction to slow the shuttle down.

   SSRL is using a more complicated form of this simulator (i.e. full six
   degrees-of-freedom, integrating orbital mechanics effects, etc.) to
   test out various control and optimization techniques to validate and
   simulate various scenarios (it would be impractical and highly unsafe
   to perform these tests on the actual shuttle with astronauts onboard).

   The Smart Systems Research Lab (SSRL) conducts cutting-edge research on
   various projects that require utilization of advanced soft computing
   techniques to achieve smart operation resulting in improved
   performance. One of these projects deals with Spacecraft Docking. The
   objective of this research is to increase safety, accuracy, and
   efficiency of spacecraft docking. SSRL is developing computer-aided
   joystick control using adaptive neurocontrol technologies that can
   learn in near real-time change in spacecraft mass properties,
   degradation in thruster strengths, and effects of uncontrolled venting
   (e.g. uncontrolled gas venting on Apollo 13 resulting from an onboard
   explosion). Thus, if thruster strengths or the mass properties of the
   spacecraft change, an adaptive control system is able to adapt and
   compensate for the variation and assists the astronaut. The technology
   developed could make spacecraft docking safer, more accurate, faster,
   and more fuel efficient.
