   Instrument Markup Language

   Background

      Instrument Markup Language (IML) is a vocabulary based on the W3C
      standard, the Extensible Markup Language (XML). IML is under
      development by NASA/GSFC and Commerce One. The approach taken by the
      development team is to create a very general and highly extensible
      framework that applies to virtually any kind of instrument that can be
      controlled by a computer. To this end, the Astronomical Instrument
      Markup Language (AIML) is the first implementation of the more general
      Instrument Markup Language, which has been created based on experience
      gained by focusing on the astronomy domain (and infrared instruments in
      particular). However, the key aspects of our approach to instrument
      description and control apply to many domains, from medical instruments
      (e.g., microscopes) to printing presses to machine assembly lines. The
      concepts behind IML apply equally well to the description and control
      of instruments in general.

   Goals

      The main project goals are to:
        * Provide as much platform independence as possible.
        * Create a system that is easy to develop, modify, maintain, and
          extend.
        * Explicitly promote reuse by design by utilizing emerging
          technologies that enable reuse.
        * Greatly reduce the implementation time for facility instruments
          (i.e., reliable, robust, state-of-the-art instruments that are easy
          to use by scientists other than the instrument designers).
        * Clearly define the interface between hardware and software
          engineers.
        * Facilitate multiple iterations of the instrument description during
          design and implementation by means of a software architecture that
          is readily adaptable to such changes.
        * Cleanly separate implementation (representation) from description.

   Scope

      Aspects addressed by IML include (but are not limited to):
        * Graphical user interfaces to control and monitor the instrument
        * Command set and command formats (arguments, data types,
          constraints, etc.)
        * Data streams (responses to commands and other telemetry from the
          instruments)
        * Visualizations of instrument telemetry
        * Support for different types of communication mechanisms
        * Online help and documentation (from terse ToolTips to detailed
          information to user manuals)

   Examples

        * IML Schema (used with the upcoming version 3 of IRC framework),
          iml.xsd and iml_shared.xsd. The first file is the IML definition.
          It includes the iml-shared definitions. These iml-shared
          definitions are used in other schemas as well, such as the
          definitions of command procedures also used in IRC.
        * Example IML file of the HAWC Housekeeping subsystem which uses
          iml.xsd.
        * Prior versions of IML.

        * IML Document Type Definition (DTD), (version used prior to XML
          schema availability) iml.dtd (formerly called aiml.dtd)
        * Example XML file of the HAWC instrument which uses iml.dtd.

   Presentations

     * PowerPoint 97 poster presentation from the 193rd Meeting of the AAS
       (January 1999): Using XML for Instrument Description, Communication
       and Control of the SOFIA / HAWC Instrument
     * Word 97 description of IML and AIML and how they are being used on
       SOFIA

   browser, download the files and open them with any text editor.
