   Welcome to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) web site on
   risk-informing the technical requirements of Part 50 to Title 10 of the
   Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR Part 50), "Domestic Licensing of
   Production and Utilization Facilities." An agency policy paper
   SECY-98-300 (at Related Sites) identifies three options for
   risk-informed modifications to 10 CFR Part 50. Option 3 from
   SECY-98-300, which is the subject of this web site, involves a study of
   risk-informed changes to specific requirements in the body of the
   regulations, including general design criteria. The details of the plan
   for risk-informing the technical requirements of 10 CFR Part 50 are
   specified in policy paper SECY-99-264 (see Related Sites).
   One important key to the success of this program is maximizing
   stakeholder feedback. Accordingly, this site contains information
   regarding upcoming meetings and announcements, as well as providing a
   forum for reviewing current documents on this effort. These documents
   may be reviewed on-line, and any comments, feedback, revisions, etc.,
   may be submitted here (see Document Reviews). In addition, we welcome
   feedback on the overall process for risk-informing the technical
   requirements of 10 CFR Part 50 (see Project Comments), and on the web
   site itself (see Web Site Feedback). Please note: Any comments
   submitted are considered public comments and will be available to
   anyone accessing this web site (see Public Comment).
