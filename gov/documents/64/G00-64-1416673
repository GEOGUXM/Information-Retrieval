Maps:

     * Complete Biological Response Map (80 Cell Line)
       The anti-cancer GI50 response space for all the compounds in the
       DTP August 1999 release. Out of the 32,918 compounds, 19,867 had
       sufficient response signal and these were used to create the
       biological response maps. Project your own GI50 data.
     * Mechanism of Action Map
       ~400 compounds which comprise the standard anti-cancer agents where
       the mode of the therapeutic effect is known.
     * Standard Anti-Cancer Agents Map
       An annotated map containing the standard set of anti-cancer agents.
     * Alternate Biological Response Map
       (60 cell line)
       An alternate GI50 response space map for the DTP August 1999
       release. It uses the DTP 60 standard cell lines.
     * Bit-Vector Structure Map
       A map of all compounds from the DTP August 1999 data set based on
       structural bit vectors.
