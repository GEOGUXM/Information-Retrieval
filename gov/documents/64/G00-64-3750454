   Edy's Grand Ice Cream Issues Urgent Recall of Girl Scouts Samoas Ice
   Cream in Parts of the Southeast

   Oakland, CA - January 24, 2002 -- Edy's Grand Ice Cream is recalling
   5,000 cartons of its Limited Edition Girl Scouts Samoas Cookie Ice
   Cream distributed in Columbus (Ohio), and parts of Georgia, Alabama,
   Mississippi, Tennessee and the Florida panhandle, because the ice cream
   may contain peanuts and egg not identified on the label. The peanuts
   and egg may be included in the ice cream, not the cookie pieces.

   Only individuals who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to peanuts
   or egg may run the risk of serious or potentially life-threatening
   allergic reaction if they consume this product. People with a peanut or
   egg allergy or sensitivity to peanuts or eggs should not consume the
   ice cream and should immediately dispose of the product.

   The potentially affected cartons of Edy's Girl Scouts Samoas Cookie Ice
   Cream are the 1.75-quart size and have a code date of 48-18-42 09 20
   AL. The code date can be found on the bottom of the carton.

   No other Edy's ice cream products are affected.

   No consumers have reported symptoms of allergic reaction. Edy's is
   working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in implementing this
   voluntary product recall and is investigating the incident. Edy's is
   also working with the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network to alert
   consumers in the affected areas.

   Consumers should send the bottom of the carton to Edy's Grand Ice
   Cream, Consumer Relations, 5929 College Avenue, Oakland, California
   94618, for a full refund. Consumers with questions may call Edy's
   Consumer Call Center at 1 888 837-4438.

   Edy's Grand Ice Cream manufactures and distributes premium and
   superpremium ice creams in the Midwest and Eastern United States.
