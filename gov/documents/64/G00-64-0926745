   NEW NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE HOME PAGES

   The National Weather Service (NWS) is considering a new set of home
   pages beginning in 2002. These home pages are being designed to provide
   easier access to the complete suite of NWS products generated on both
   local and national scales.

   Each page will have a similar banner on the top and a menu on the left
   hand side. In the center of the page, a graphical interface has been
   set up to guide you through some of the highlighted NWS products.

   Careful thought has been put into the design to address user
   accessibility, particularly for individuals with disabilities.

   The page is a prototype. It is not complete, and is subject to change.

   We would greatly appreciate your assistance. Please email any comments
   you may have to: NWSWebimage.Feedback@noaa.gov
