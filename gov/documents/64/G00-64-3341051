                           Mound Action Committee
   The next MAC Committee Meeting to be held on:
   Friday, February 8, 2002, 9:00a.m. - 10:00 a.m.
   Community Room, City Building, 10 North First Street, Miamisburg


   Objective
   The U.S. Department of Energy encouraged the formation of Mound Action
   Committees to promote the exchange of information between DOE and
   members of Mound's interested public. It was felt that such a group
   could be a source of community values to be factored into decisions
   about the cleanup and reuse of the Mound Plant site.


   Description
   MACs are designed to be open forums for public discussion and
   information sharing. A steering committee made up of representatives of
   the community, DOE, and its contractor coordinates MAC activities and
   meetings. The committee receives monthly updates of environmental
   information from Mound and plans the presentations for the larger
   quarterly MAC meeting.  The steering committee is a volunteer  group of
   MAC members committed to the success of the MAC's public participation
   objectives. All interested stakeholders are invited to participate on
   the steering committee.
