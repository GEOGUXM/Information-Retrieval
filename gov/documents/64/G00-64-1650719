                              Version 2.0, 2001
             Includes sequence tags from 5229 independent clones
            For comments or questions contact: Jeffery L. Miller
   This search page was designed to provide an internet-linked summary of
    information available for all genetic sequences deposited in Hembase.
       Sequence information from two separate libraries generated from
    proliferating human erythroid cells are included. Clones from the two
   libraries are distinguished by the prefixes AD versus AX in the unique
       identifier code. More information about the Hembase project is
                 available at: http://hembase.niddk.nih.gov

    Use the table above to rapidly access the sequence-based information
    files. If the unique identifier (example: ad09b07) or name (example:
     beta globin) of a sequence or gene is known, a direct search may be
   performed. The database may be searched for sequences sharing homology
     to genes with known or hypothesized function. Additionally, Hembase
    clone subsets may be selected based upon their homology with genomic
     sequences assigned to each chromosome (Draft Human Genome Browser).

    Enter as much or as little of the ID number or name as you prefer. An
    asterisk (*) may be entered in the Unique ID box to see a list of all
     data files. An asterisk may also be used if a partial name is known
    (for instance, carbo*). You may select one or more than one category
    during a single search. However, a lack of identified data files may
    result from the simultaneous selection of multiple categories. Click
     the reset button to redefine your search with new parameters or to
                             begin a new search.

   Once you have defined the parameters of your inquiry, click the "Search
    Hembase" button. Your computer will be directed to a "Hembase Search
   Results" page that lists the unique identifier (ID NO.) and name of the
    files matching the parameters selected. Clicking on the ID (shown in
               red) provides access to individual data files.

   Each Hembase file comprises primary sequence data as well as summaries
         of Unigene and Blast homology searches (National Center for
        Biotechnology Information). Individual files will be updated
     periodically (search dates are included in each file). For the most
   current information available, the primary sequence data may be used to
                 search Unigene, Blast, or other databases.
