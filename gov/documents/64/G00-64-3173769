                   CRAPO JOINS ADVOCATES FOR SUGAR PROGRAM

           Amendment to strike program defeated on procedural vote


   Washington, DC - During debate on the Farm Bill in the U.S. Senate
   today, the latest attack on U.S. agriculture came in an amendment to
   eliminate the current U.S. sugar program. Idaho Senator Mike Crapo
   joined in the floor debate, which ended in a procedural vote that kept
   the program intact. The motion to table the Gregg amendment was agreed
   to on a vote of 71 to 29.

   During debate, Crapo debunked a number of false arguments against the
   sugar program and demonstrated that the program operates at no cost to
   the U.S. Treasury. He cited examples of sugar prices and predatory
   trade practices used by other countries, and advocated strongly in
   favor of maintaining the program.

   Crapo said, "Historically, the U.S. sugar program operates at no cost
   to U.S. taxpayers and, in fact, puts dollars in the Treasury which are
   then allocated to other important priorities in our country. Whether
   we're talking about the consumer in the United States, the taxpayer in
   the United States, or the sugar growers in the United States, the sugar
   program is a program that is designed for well-intentioned purposes and
   is working well. There is no reason that we should have to go through
   this debate endlessly as those who would like to drive the price of
   sugar down even further in the United States continue to attack the
   sugar program."
