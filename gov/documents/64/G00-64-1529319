     Georgia Flood-Frequency Information

   The USGS Georgia District flood-frequency information Web site presents
   and illustrates methods of estimating the magnitude and frequency of
   floods having recurrence intervals of 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, and
   500 years for rural Georgia streams. Data are based on flood-frequency
   analyses of annual peak-discharge data at streamflow monitoring sites
   through September 1990.

   This Web site includes:
     * regional relations for estimating the magnitude and frequency of
       flood discharges on rural, ungaged, non-regulated streams
     * method for estimating flood-frequency data at gaged and ungaged
       sites on rural streams
     * flood-frequency data on mainstem streams with drainage basins
       located in more than one region
