   Information Report Services

   As a supplement to standard reports available through the Laboratory's
   business systems, ECT staff can provide custom reports referencing data
   residing on one or more of the laboratoryÂ’s business systems. This
   assumes, of course, that the requesting person has the appropriate
   permissions to read the contents of these reports. In addition to hard
   copy, electronic versions can also be created for downloading for use
   with MS Excel, MS Access, or other tools on the customer's desktop.

   For more information, contact the Information Systems Department office
   at 630-252-7156.
