What is GPO Form 3868?

   Entitled "Notification of Intent to Publish," this form is the primary
   means of notifying the Superintendent of Documents of a new publication
   in all media. Form 3868 is designed to insure that your publication
   will receive proper consideration for inclusion in our Sales and
   Federal Depository Library Programs.

   By providing complete information prior to submitting your printing
   requisition, you can be assured that we will have adequate time to make
   the best decision.

   Individual copies of GPO Form 3868 do not need to be prepared for
   publications if they are produced regularly under a term contract.
   Dated (e.g., regularly issued) periodicals, which are part of an annual
   subscription service, are an example of this type of publication.
   However, if a publication is printed under a "general usage" or
   miscellaneous publication contract, a Form 3868 should be submitted for
   each title published.

   The "Notification of Intent to Publish" Form can be completed and
   submitted online.  If you prefer to mail the form to the Superintendent
   of Documents, you can print the PDF version or request copies (which
   include instructions for completion) from GPO's Regional Printing
   Procurement Offices, Documents Control Branch (address listed below),
   or from your GPO Account Representative.
