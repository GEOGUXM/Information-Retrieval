                        Welcome to the BEST Program!

   The BEST Program is a monitoring and assessment program of the
   Biological Resource Division of the United States Geological Survey
   (USGS). BEST evaluates environmental contaminants and their effects on
   species and lands under the stewardship of the Department of Interior
   to provide scientific information and guide management actions.

   The goals of the BEST Program are to measure and assess the effects of
   contaminants on selected species and habitats throughout the Nation;
   conduct research and synthesis activities directed at providing
   innovative biomonitoring methods and tools for operational
   applications; and deliver effective and efficient tools to DOI bureaus
   for assessing contaminant threats to species and lands under their
   stewardship.
