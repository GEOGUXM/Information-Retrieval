         ACTS Experiments Operations Concluded

         On May 31, 2000 the ACTS Experiments Program officially came to a
         close.   After the satellite's launch in September 1993 and
         two-and-a-half month on-orbit system checkout, the Experiments program
         began on December 1, 1993.  Experiments were continuously supported for
         78 months of operations.  The conclusion of the Experiments Program was
         celebrated at the recent 6th Ka-Band Utilization Conference held in
         Cleveland, Ohio on May 31-June 2, 2000.  The first day of this
         conference was devoted to presenting results from the ACTS Project
         Experiments and spacecraft operations. The satellite supported 103
         experiments and over 80 demonstrations.
         The 103 experiments were proposed by 61 unique principal investigator
         (PI) organizations coming from government, industry, or academia.  Of
         the 103 selected experiments over the whole program, 50% were from
         government organizations, 34% from industry, and 16% from academia.
         Experiment hours on the spacecraft totaled over 74,000 throughout the
         whole program.
