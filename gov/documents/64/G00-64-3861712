      250m Products

      These are the products that will be distributed by the Land Discipline
      team.

      Note: The ESDT in the filename of 250m products has been renamed to
      MOD09Q1, MOD09Q1C, and MOD13Q1 to prevent confusion with the 500m
      products distributed through the EDC DAAC.

   MODIS 250m Surface Reflectance      MOD09Q1
   Eric Vermote (PI)                   Level 3
   An 8 day gridded (250m/500m) surface reflectance product.

   A coarse resolution (5km) product name MOD09Q1C is also made available
   for QA purposes.
   MODIS 250m Vegetation Indices       MOD13Q1
   Alfredo Huete (PI)                  Level 3
   A gridded (250m) vegetation indices product
   MODIS 250m Vegetation Cover Change  MOD44A
   John Townshend (PI)                 Level 3
   A gridded (250m) vegetation cover change product

      Sample Products

      Most images found on this site are quasi-true-color images (MODIS band
      1 in red, band 4 in green, and band 3 in blue) illustrating the MODIS
      Land Surface Reflectance product. A few images may use a different band
      combination, as indicated.

      For more imagery samples visit the MODIS Land Image Gallery.

      Quality Assurance

      Quality Assurance of products is a focus of the MODIS Land Discipline
      team. Both the developers of the product and the Land Discipline
      Quality Assurance personnel will be analyzing the products for quality
      and consistency. A description of the MODLAND approach to QA can be
      found at the MODIS Land Discipline QA Site.

   Product Validation

   The MODIS 250m products will be validated through a number of field
   based activities. A description of the MODLAND approach to validation
   can be found at the MODIS Validation web site.

   250m Surface Reflectance

   [SouthAfrica.A2000158.0900.150x115.jpg] The MODIS level 3 surface
   reflectance product, MOD09_L3, is an 8-day composite of the gridded
   level 2 surface reflectance products, MOD09_L2G. This product is
   generated by process MOD_PR09A of PGE21,  and runs for each tile and
   for each eight-day period. The required inputs are all the MOD09 level
   2G files produced by MOD_PRMGR (PGE13), at each resolution, that are
   generated on the days being processed and that overlap the tile being
   processed. Additionally, MOD_PR09A requires the pointer files at the
   resolution (MODPTQKM) and the level 2G geolocation angle files
   (MODMGGA), all of which are the products of MOD_PRMGPNTR (PGE12).

   Observations in the MOD09_L2G files are composited in a multi-step
   process. Observations from overlapping orbits are composited by overall
   pixel quality, or score, and by observational coverage; then,
   observations from different orbits are composited by score and by the
   minimum of the 500m band 3 value. Note that the compositing algorithm
   first eliminates pixels with a low score (e. g., bad data) or low
   observational coverage, and applies minimum band 3 compositing only to
   pixels that are equal in terms of overall quality and coverage.
