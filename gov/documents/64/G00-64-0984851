    The Laboratory of Biochemistry has a long tradition of commitment to basic
    research. It consists of eleven independent groups organized in five
    sections addressing a diverse set of research problems in molecular biology,
    genetics, microbiology, protein chemistry, biophysics, and immunology with
    the common goal of solving basic mechanisms of cellular regulation. The
    success of this multidisciplinary approach is achieved by a sustained policy
    to recruit and support young independent investigators and to provide them
    with a laboratory equipped with state-of-the-art equipment.

   Tenured investigators in the Laboratory of Biochemistry are:

     Claude B. Klee, M.D., Principal Investigator, Laboratory Chief, and
   Chief of the Protein Biochemistry Section

     Yawen Bai, Ph.D., Principal Investigator

     Dhruba K. Chattoraj, Ph.D., Principal Investigator

     Florence Davidson, Ph.D., Principal Investigator

     Dean Hamer, Ph.D., Principal Investigator and Chief of the Gene
   Structure and Regulation Section

     Edward Kuff, Ph.D., Scientist Emeritus

     Michael Lichten, Ph.D., Principal Investigator

     Kira K. Lueders, Ph.D., Staff Scientist

     Mark A. Mortin, Ph. D., Principal Investigator

     Bruce M. Paterson, Ph. D., Principal Investigator and Chief of the
   Biochemistry of Gene Expression Section

     Maxine F. Singer, Ph.D., Scientist Emeritus

     Sriram Subramaniam, Ph.D., Principal Investigator and Chief of the
   Biophysics Section

     Barbara J. Thomas, Ph. D., Principal Investigator

     Ngoc-Diep Vu, Ph.D., Staff Scientist

     Michael Yarmolinsky, Ph.D, Principal Investigator and Chief of the
