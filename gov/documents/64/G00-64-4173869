        The Fort Worth ARTCC Traffic Management Unit (TMU) received the
       Champion of Public Service Award for outstanding customer service from
       the DFW Federal Executive Board recognizing the on-going joint
       development with NASA on utilization of the Center/TRACON Automation
       System (CTAS), a system designed to help provide efficient usage of the
       arrival runways at Dallas/Fort Worth International airport. Presently,
       only a handful of the nations 20 air route traffic control centers
       (ARTCC) are involved in the testing of this system that is projected to
       be operational in the nations en route centers and Terminal Radar
       Approach Control (TRACON) facilities in the next five years.

       In addition to CTAS development, Fort Worth ARTCC TMU served as a test
       facility for the Integrated Terminal Weather System (ITWS). By using
       this tool, Fort Worth ARTCC TMU has been able to pinpoint the times and
       duration when certain routes will be unusable due to convective weather
       activity, resulting in minimized weather related delays to the
       customer.

       Fort Worth ARTCC TMU recently achieved a commendable rating by the FAA
       in an internal evaluation as a result of positive customer feedback and
       outstanding customer service provided by the facility through the
       Traffic Management Unit. The unit also worked together with Continental
       Airlines in a Collaborative Decision Making Initiative involving
       northbound Continental Airlines traffic departing from Houstons
       Intercontinental Airport and traversing Fort Worth ARTCC during periods
       of heavy air traffic activity. The initiative being developed is an
       attempt to enhance system capacity and effectiveness while reducing
       delays on the ground and in the air, further evidence of the TMU
       commitment to customer service.
