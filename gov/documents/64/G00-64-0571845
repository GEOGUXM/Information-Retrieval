       All payments must be made in guaranteed funds such as a cashiers

       checks if we have a letter of guarantee on file from your bank.
       The guarantee must be filed within two weeks prior to the sale. It
       must be from an officer of the bank and state that the bank will
       guarantee a specific amount or up to whatever amount stated. It
       also must have their account number and phone number of the bank.
       This letter is only valid for duration of the sale. The Treasurer's
       Office requires a new letter of guarantee each year to purchase
       liens.

       the exact amount directed to avoid any overpayments.

       eligible parcels. This list will be available in mid-February.  The
       parcels will be available for purchase beginning February 19, 2002
       through January 31, 2003. These purchases will have additional fees

       The Treasurer's Office is PAPERLESS.  Certificates are no longer
       printed. When a person purchases a certificate the list is
       validated (AT THE TIME OF PAYMENT), this list represents the
       receipt for purchase.
   19. How can I get a replacement certificate?
       The Office will send a Final Tax Sale report a week following the
       close of the sale. An annual Unmatured Portfolio will be sent to
       every buyer the first week of March.
   20. How do I know if my liens have been redeemed?
       Monthly Activity statements will be sent out the third business day
       of each month to ONLY those buyers that have activity in that
       month. For those paperless buyers, the Office will process the
       refund check the same day or following business day. If multiple
       redemptions occur in the same day, a person may receive one check
       for various liens. The stub will be itemized with the parcel, CP
       and dollar amount per lien. The Office has the capability to
       include 11 redemption amounts per check.
