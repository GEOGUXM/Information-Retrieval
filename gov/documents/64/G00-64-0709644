                                  Abstract

   We found an important piece of evidence for magnetic reconnection
   inflow in a flare on 1999 March 18. The flare occurred on the northeast
   limb, displaying a nice cusp-shaped soft X-ray loop and a plasmoid
   ejection typical for the long-duration events. The EUV observation of
   the same flare shows us a bubble-like void ejection. The core of this
   EUV void corresponds to the soft X-ray plasmoid. Moreover, as this void
   is ejected, magnetic reconnection occurs at the disconnecting point. A
   clear ongoing pattern toward the magnetic X-point is seen. The velocity
   of this apparent motion is about 5 km s^-1, which is an upper limit on
   reconnection inflow speed. Based on this observation, we derive the
   reconnection rate as M[A]=0.001-0.03, where M[A] is an Alfvén Mach
   number of the inflow.

   The EIT instrument aboard SOHO obtains full disk images of the Sun
   through four channels at Fe IX,X (171 A), Fe XII (195 A), Fe XV (284
   A), and He II (304 A). We construct a model differential emission
   measure (DEM) map, using the EIT images from the four channels which
   accurately covers the temperature range 80,000 - 2.2 MK. We use the DEM
   map to calculate absolutely calibrated images of individual lines or
   passbands in addition to the four EIT channels. The validity of our
   model is shown with a long term comparision to the SOHO SEM instrument
   full disk irradiances. An important application presented here is the
   time history from 1996-2000 of the pure He II (304 A) solar irradiance.
   Additional spatial and spectral comparisons can be done using the SOHO
   CDS instrument and the SERTS rocket flight.

                                  Abstract

   We have modeled the contribution to solar radio emission at 328 and
   1446 MHz from free-free thermal bremsstrahlung emission, using a full
   disk differential emission measure (DEM) map of the Sun. The DEM map is
   produced from four EUV images (171 A, 195 A, 284 A, and 304 A) for a
   selected day from the EIT instrument on the SOHO satellite, using a
   method developed previously by Cook, Newmark, and Moses. The EIT
   instrument images the Sun out to 1.4 R, with a pixel size of 2.6 arc
   sec and spatial resolution of 2 pixels. We perform the radiative
   transfer calculation, determining the optical depth scale for free-free
   emission and the emergent absolute intensity for each pixel in the
   field-of-view using the individual DEM of that pixel, and transforming
   integrals over the line-of-sight into integrals over temperature via
   the DEM. We can compare our model calculation with the VLA radio
   observations of Vourlidas from 1998 January 31. Our model is in good
   agreement outside of active regions, where free-free emission should
   truly be the dominant emission mechanism. In areas such as sunspots,
   where the strong magnetic field leads to additional gyro resonance
   radiation, the difference between the observed total intensity and our
   calculated thermal component should be a good estimate of the
   nonthermal gyro radiation. This work is supported by NASA under
   W-19,348 and by the Office of Naval Research.

                                  Abstract

   In this paper we study the three-dimensional structure of hot
   (T[e]~1.5-2.5 MK) loops in solar active region NOAA 7986, observed on
   1996 August 30 with the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on
   board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). This complements a
   first study (Paper I) on cooler (T[e]~1.0-1.5 MK) loops of the same
   active region, using the same method of Dynamic Stereoscopy to
   reconstruct the three-dimensional geometry. We reconstruct the
   three-dimensional coordinates x(s), y(s), z(s), the density n[e](s),
   and temperature profile T[e](s) of 35 individual loop segments (as a
   function of the loop coordinate s) using EIT 195 and 284 Å images. The
   major findings are as follows. (1) All loops are found to be in
   hydrostatic equilibrium, in the entire temperature regime of
   T[e]=1.0-2.5 MK. (2) The analyzed loops have a height of 2-3 scale
   heights, and thus only segments extending over about one vertical scale
   height have sufficient emission measure contrast for detection. (3) The
   temperature gradient over the lowest scale height is of order
   dT/ds~1-10 K km^-1. (4) The radiative loss rate is found to exceed the
   conductive loss rate by about two orders or magnitude in the coronal
   loop segments, implying that the loops cannot be in quasi-static
   equilibrium, since standard steady-state loop models show that
   radiative and conductive losses are comparable. (5) A steady state
   could only be maintained if the heating rate E[H] matches exactly the
   radiative loss rate in hydrostatic equilibrium, requiring a heat
   deposition length λ[H] of the half density scale height λ. (6) We find
   a correlation of p~L^-1 between loop base pressure and loop length,
   which is not consistent with the scaling law predicted from
   steady-state models of large-scale loops. All observational findings
   indicate consistently that the energy balance of the observed EUV loops
   cannot be described by steady-state models.

   We found a piece of evidence of magnetic reconnection inflow in a flare
   on March 18, 1999. This is a flare occurred on the north-east limb that
   showed a nice cusp shape soft X-ray loop and a plasmoid ejection
   typical for the long-duration-events. The EUV observation of the same
   flare shows us a bubble-like void ejection. The core of this EUV void
   corresponds to the soft X-ray plasmoid. Moreover, as this void is
   ejected, magnetic reconnection occurs at the disconnecting point. And a
   clear ingoing pattern toward the magnetic X-point is seen. The inflow
   velocity is about 5 km/s. Based on this observation, we derived the
   reconnection rate to be M[A] = 0.007, where M[A] is a Alfven Mach
   number of the inflow.

   Active region 7968 was observed during runs of a coordinated SOHO,
   Yohkoh and ground-based observatory program (Joint Observing Program,
   JOP, 17). The region appeared and decayed in a seven day period (June 3
   to 10, 1996). In this time, mainly during June 6, it presented a very
   dynamical behaviour. Flux emerged in between the two main polarities
   and Arch Filament Systems (AFS) were observed to be linked to this
   emergence. We analyze the evolution of some over dark arches observed
   during flux emergence, forming two systems of AFS. Modelling the
   magnetic field, we find that these systems were associated to field
   lines having dips tangent to the photosphere (the so called "bald
   patches", BPs). We discuss their evolution in terms of emergence of the
   dipped portion of the lines or of magnetic field reconnection.

                                  Abstract

   We report observations obtained with the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging
   Telescope (EIT) on board SOHO of a large-scale coronal transient
   propagating across the disk of the Sun at a speed of 250 km s^-1, in
   apparent association with a flare and coronal mass ejection. The
   observations consist of a series of images taken in the Fe XII 195 Å
   bandpass at an average cadence of 15 minutes. A visible increase in
   coronal emission propagates away from the erupting region, traveling
   across most of the solar disk in less than an hour. As the wave
   propagates through the ambient corona, its path is not homogeneous, and
   it is less observable near strong magnetic features such as active
   regions and magnetic neutral lines. The characteristics of this event
   appear to be representative of several other ``EIT waves,'' which we
   identify as strong candidates for the coronal manifestation of Moreton
   waves.

                                  Abstract

   We have developed a procedure to produce a differential emission
   measure (DEM) map of the Sun using images from the four channels of the
   EIT instrument at 171 (Fe IX/X), 195 (Fe XII), 284 (Fe XV), and 304 A
   (He II). We use images from the EIT CalRoc sounding rocket flight on 16
   October 1997. Our DEM procedure could also be applied to calibrated
   SOHO EIT images and to TRACE observations. We find that the slope of
   the DEM distribution over the temperature range log T = 5.5 to 6.0 is
   typically near +1 for quiet areas, but is +3/2 for active regions. In
   their thermal structure active regions are not just areas brighter than
   quiet areas whose DEM distributions continue to rise to even hotter
   temperatures, but have greater relative amounts of hotter material to
   cooler material toward 1M K and above than do quiet areas. The DEM
   should not be modeled in terms of an average structure, either plane
   parallel or with loop geometry. Since at least the time of the SO82A
   spectroheliograph observations from Skylab it has been clear that
   structures observed in the temperature range of any one line differ
   from structures observed in a hotter or cooler line. Any DEM
   distribution is obtained from intensity observations through all
   structures in the line-of-sight, and is composed from the combined
   individual DEM distributions of these structures. We interpret the DEM
   map in terms of ensembles of individual loops of differing
   temperatures, where the ensembles are characteristically different in
   quiet and active areas of the Sun.

                                  Abstract

   The three-dimensional structure of solar active region NOAA 7986
   observed on 1996 August 30 with the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging
   Telescope (EIT) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
   is analyzed. We develop a new method of dynamic stereoscopy to
   reconstruct the three-dimensional geometry of dynamically changing
   loops, which allows us to determine the orientation of the mean loop
   plane with respect to the line of sight, a prerequisite to correct
   properly for projection effects in three-dimensional loop models. With
   this method and the filter-ratio technique applied to EIT 171 and 195 Å
   images we determine the three-dimensional coordinates [x(s), y(s),
   z(s)], the loop width w(s), the electron density n_e(s), and the
   electron temperature T_e(s) as a function of the loop length s for 30
   loop segments. Fitting the loop densities with an exponential density
   model n_e(h) we find that the mean of inferred scale height
   temperatures, T^lambda_e=1.22+/-0.23 MK, matches closely that of EIT
   filter-ratio temperatures, T^EIT_e=1.21+/-0.06 MK. We conclude that
   these cool and rather large-scale loops (with heights of h~30-225 Mm)
   are in hydrostatic equilibrium. Most of the loops show no significant
   thickness variation w(s), but we measure for most of them a positive
   temperature gradient (dT/ds>0) across the first scale height above the
   footpoint. Based on these temperature gradients we find that the
   conductive loss rate is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the
   radiative loss rate, which is in strong contrast to hot active region
   loops seen in soft X-rays. We infer a mean radiative loss time of
   tau_rad~40 minutes at the loop base. Because thermal conduction is
   negligible in these cool EUV loops, they are not in steady state, and
   radiative loss has entirely to be balanced by the heating function. A
   statistical heating model with recurrent heating events distributed
   along the entire loop can explain the observed temperature gradients if
   the mean recurrence time is <~10 minutes. We computed also a potential
   field model (from SOHO/MDI magnetograms) and found a reasonable match
   with the traced EIT loops. With the magnetic field model we determined
   also the height dependence of the magnetic field B(h), the plasma
   parameter beta(h), and the Alfvén velocity v_A(h). No correlation was
   found between the heating rate requirement E_H0 and the magnetic field
   B_foot at the loop footpoints.

   Solar EUV images recorded by the EUV Imaging Telescope (EIT) on SOHO
   have been used to evaluate temperature and density as a function of
   position in two largescale features in the corona observed in the
   temperature range of 1.0-2.0MK. Such observations permit estimates of
   longitudinal temperature gradients (if present) in the corona and,
   consequently, estimates of thermal conduction and radiative losses as a
   function of position in the features. We examine two relatively cool
   features as recorded in EIT's Feix/x (171Å) and Fexii (195Å) bands in a
   decaying active region. The first is a long-lived loop-like feature
   with one leg, ending in the active region, much more prominent than one
   or more distant footpoints assumed to be rooted in regions of weakly
   enhanced field. The other is a near-radial feature, observed at the
   West limb, which may be either the base of a very high loop or the base
   of a helmet streamer. We evaluate energy requirements to support a
   steady-state energy balance in these features and find in both
   instances that downward thermal conductive losses (at heights above the
   transition region) are inadequate to support local radiative losses,
   which are the predominant loss mechanism. The requirement that a
   coronal energy deposition rate proportional to the square of the
   ambient electron density (or pressure) is present in these cool coronal
   features provides an additional constraint on coronal heating
   mechanisms.

                                  Abstract

   A comparison of the COBE 1 Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment
   (DIRBE) all-sky survey with the locations of known galaxies in the IRAS
   Catalog of Extragalactic Objects and the Center for Astrophysics
   Catalog of Galaxies led to the detection of as many as 57 galaxies. In
   this paper, we present the photometric data for these galaxies and an
   analysis of the seven galaxies that were detected at lambda > 100 mu m.
   Estimates of the ratio of the mass of the cold dust (CD) component
   detected at Td = 20-30 K to a very cold dust (VCD) component with Td ~
   10-15 K suggest that between 2%-100% of the cirrus-like CD mass can
   also exist in many of these galaxies as VCD. In one galaxy, M33, the
   DIRBE photometry at 240 mu m suggests as much as 26 times as much VCD
   may be present as compared to the cirrus-like component. Further
   submillimeter measurements of this galaxy are required to verify such a
   large population of VCD. We also present 10 galaxies that were detected
   in the sky region not previously surveyed by IRAS and that can be used
   to construct a flux-limited all-sky catalog of galaxies brighter than
   1000 Jy with a modest completeness limit of about 65%.

                                  Abstract

   In 1.5 years of operation, The Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope
   (EIT) on SOHO has obtained over 40,000 images of the Sun in four
   wavebands between 171 Angstroms and 304 Angstroms, with spatial
   resolution limited only by the pixel scale of 2.59 arcsec. These
   images, and in particular compilations of time series of images into
   digital movies, have changed several of our ideas about the corona at
   temperatures of 0.9 - 2.5 MK.

   For the first time, we are able to see outflow in polar plumes and
   microjets inputting momentum into the high-speed, polar wind flow. For
   the first time, in conjunction with the LASCO coronagraphs and
   ground-based He I imagers, we have been able to see all the structures
   involved in coronal mass ejections (CMEs), from the surface of the Sun
   to 30 solar radii above it. In several cases, we have been able to
   observe directly the dramatic Moreton waves emanating from the active
   region where the CMEs originate, and radiating across virtually the
   entire visible hemisphere of the Sun. We interpret these large-scale
   coronal disturbances as fast-mode waves. Such events appear in the
   SOHO-LASCO coronagraphs as earthward-directed, and several have been
   detected by solar wind monitoring experiments on SOHO and other
   spacecraft.

   We have been able to view a variety of small-scale phenomena as well,
   including motions in prominences and filaments, macrospicular and polar
   microjet eruptions, and fine structures in the polar crown filament
   belt. The multi-wavelength capability of EIT makes it possible to
   determine the temperature of the coronal plasma and, here, too, we have
   been afforded a novel view: the heating in coronal active regions
   occurs over a considerably larger area than the high-density loops
   structures alone (i.e., bright features) would indicate.

                                  Abstract

   The three-dimensional (3D) structure of solar active region NOAA 7986
   observed on 1996 August 30 with the Extrem-ultraviolet Imaging
   Telescope (EIT) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO)
   is analyzed. We develop a new method of Dynamic Stereoscopy to
   reconstruct the 3D geometry of dynamically changing loops, which allows
   us to determine the orientation of the loop plane with respect to the
   line-of-sight, a prerequisite to correct properly for projection
   effects in 3D loop models. With this method and the filter-ratio
   technique applied to EIT 171 angle and 195 angle images we determine
   the 3D coordinates [x(s),y(s),z(s)], the loop width w(s), the electron
   density n_e(s), and the electron temperature T_e(s) as function of the
   loop length s for 30 loop segments. Fitting the loop densities with an
   exponential density model n_e(h) we find that the mean of inferred
   scale height temperatures, T_e^{lambda} = 1.22 plus or minus 0.23 MK,
   matches closely that of EIT filter-ratio temperatures, T_e^{EIT} = 1.21
   plus or minus 0.06 MK. We conclude that these cool and rather
   large-scale loops (with heights of h ~30-225 Mm), which dominate the
   EIT 171 angle images, are in hydrostatic equilibrium. Most of the loops
   show no significant thickness variation w(s), but we can measure for
   most of them a positive temperature gradient (dT/ds > 0) across the
   first scale height above the footpoint. Based on these temperature
   gradients we find that the conductive loss rate is about two orders of
   magnitude smaller than the radiative loss rate, which is in strong
   contrast to hot active region loops seen in SXR. We infer a mean
   radiative loss time of {tau}_{rad} ~40 minutes. For steady state
   models, the heating rate has to balance the radiative loss, i.e. the
   heating rate has to scale with the squared density (E_H propto n_e^2).
   From potential-field extrapolations we determine also the magnetic
   field strength B(s), the plasma beta-parameter beta(s), and the Alfven
   velocity v_A(s) along the loops, and discuss the findings in the
   context of coronal heating models.

   The Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on board the SOHO
   (SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory) satellite provides wide-field
   images of the corona and transition region on the solar disc and up to
   1.4 solar radii above the limb. Its normal incidence multilayer-coated
   optics select spectral emission lines from FeIX (171 Ang), FeXII (195
   Ang), FeXV (284 Ang), and HeII (304 Ang) with 2.6 arcsecond resolution
   which allow us to describe Solar activity over a wide temperature
   range. EIT is providing unique EUV observations of the structure and
   evolution of active regions. Here we show movies of active region 8059
   from July 3-10, 1997. The high temporal variability of the AR loops is
   very evident. Initial temperature and density diagnostics are explored
   as well as a comparison with diagnostics from the SOHO-CDS instrument.

   SOHO EIT spectroheliograms showing the polar coronal holes during the
   present sunspot minimum are compared with National Solar Observatory
   (Kitt Peak) magnetograms taken in Fe I lambda 8688 and Ca II lambda
   8542. The chromospheric lambda 8542 magnetograms, obtained on a
   routine, near-daily basis since 1996 June, reveal the Sun's strong
   polar fields with remarkable clarity. We find that the Fe IX lambda 171
   polar plumes occur where minority-polarity flux is in contact with flux
   of the dominant polarity inside each polar hole. Moreover, the
   locations of "plume haze" coincide approximately with the patterns of
   brightened He II lambda 304 network within the coronal hole. The
   observations appear to be consistent with mechanisms of plume formation
   involving magnetic reconnection between unipolar flux concentrations
   and nearby bipoles. The fact that minority-polarity fields constitute
   only a small fraction of the total magnetic flux within the polar holes
   suggests that plumes are not the main source of the high-speed polar
   wind.

   The SOHO Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) recorded a series
   of events on April 1, 1997 with a 12-minute cadence of 195 Angstrom (Fe
   XII) images. A Moreton wave was observed emanating from a flaring
   active region beginning at 13:56 UT 1-April-1997. The wave travelled at
   initial speeds of approximately 300 km/sec, spreading across the solar
   disk radially from the flare. The CME observed by SOHO/LASCO was
   observable at both the east and west limbs in the C2 (2-6 solar radii)
   and C3 (3.7-30 solar radii) coronagraphs. The event was the site of
   strong emerging flux, and a number of explosive jet-like surges were
   observed at the east edge of the region prior to, throughout, and
   following the event.

   The discussion will include topology, comparison to Moreton wave/MHD
   theory predictions, and solar wind signatures.

                                  Abstract

   The EUV Imaging Telescope (EIT) on the SOHO provides the capability for
   multi-wavelength imaging of the corona in four spectral bands, centered
   at 171, 195, 284, and 304 Angstroms, using multilayer telescope
   technology. These bands encompass coronal temperatures from 1 MK to 2.5
   MK as well as the upper chromosphere, at about 60,000 K. In particular,
   nearly simultaneous imaging in the 171 and 195 Angstrom bands, the
   former including major Fe IX and Fe X emission lines, the latter
   including a strong Fe XII line, provides a capability to infer the
   morphology and characteristics of the corona at temperatures of 1.0 -
   1.7 MK. We have examined the corona in this temperature range over an
   active region observed from SOHO from May - September, 1996 and find
   that low-lying loops (below a density scale height of 75,000 km,
   characteristic of Fe X) vary little in brightness and temperature along
   their length. For features extending to greater heights, however, both
   brightness gradients and temperature gradients are observed.
   Preliminary analysis of the observations when the region was on the
   West limb on September 30 indicates a small positive temperature
   gradient of approximately 0.5 K/km in one loop system that extended
   above 100,000 km. On the other hand, a nearly radial feature extending
   to the edge of the EIT FOV was isothermal or had at most a slight
   negative temperature gradient. Such measurements may have application
   to the modeling of coronal loops and streamers and the processes of
   coronal heating and solar wind acceleration.

                                  Abstract

   We present unique time series of high-resolution solar images from the
   normal-incidence Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on board
   the SOHO spacecraft. With a pixel scale of 2.6 arc sec and a detector
   dynamic range of > 10(4) , the EIT can be used to study the dynamics of
   chromospheric and coronal features in multilayer bandpasses optimized
   for He II 304 Angstroms (0.08 MK), Fe IX/X 171, 173 Angstroms (0.8 -
   1.0 MK), Fe XII 195 Angstroms (1.5 MK), and Fe XV 284 Angstroms (2.0 -
   2.5 MK). Among the most striking features of the digital movies we will
   display are: the dynamic nature of small-scale loop features in the
   polar coronal holes, the constant activity of the polar crown filament
   systems, the locations of the bases of polar plumes, the presence of
   dark (scattering) filament material in the coronal emission line
   images, and the evolution of a unique, linear, dark feature in a young
   active region. The latter feature is suggestive of the ``coronal void''
   observed in the electron scattering corona by Macqueen et al./ (1983).
