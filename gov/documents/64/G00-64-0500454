Mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences

   The mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences
   (NIGMS) is to support basic biomedical research that is not targeted to
   specific diseases. NIGMS funds studies on genes, proteins, and cells,
   as well as on fundamental processes, like communication within and
   between cells, how our bodies use energy, and how we respond to
   medicines. NIGMS attempts to ensure the vitality and continued
   productivity of basic biomedical research, while producing the next
   generation of scientific breakthroughs and training the next generation
   of scientists. Throughout all of NIGMS' research and research training
   programs, emphasis is placed on increasing the participation of
   underrepresented minorities in the biomedical research enterprise. One
   important consequence of a more diverse research community is likely to
   be increased attention to areas of research that can reduce health
   disparities. It is expected that this report, which reflects NIGMS'
   current strategic plan for reducing health disparities, will be amended
   over time as needed, so comments and other feedback are welcome.

Health Disparities Focus Areas

   Pharmacogenetics

   Pharmacogenetics is the effect of inheritance on drug action.
   Individual variability occurs in both the desired therapeutic effects
   of drugs, as well as in their toxicity (or side effects). In 1998, it
   was reported that adverse drug effects account for 100,000 deaths per
   year, as well as 5 to 10 percent of hospital admissions. Some of these
   problems can be prevented through simple adjustments in medication
   choices or amounts, once the basic underlying scientific principles are
   understood. The knowledge from basic research will help guide
   "personalized medicine"--the development of drug therapies intended to
   treat people as individuals.

   Ethnogeographic differences in drug responses are known to exist
   between populations. The best known instances are associated with the
   enzymes of drug clearance. Genetic polymorphisms significantly affect
   the elimination of several major classes of important drugs in clinical
   use today, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, several
   cardiovascular drugs, antiepileptics, and anti-ulcer drugs. For some of
   the enzymes involved in drug clearance, much less is known. For
   example, it has been observed anecdotally that African Americans
   frequently require higher doses of cyclosporine A, an immunosuppressant
   drug given for transplants and a substrate of an enzyme required to
   eliminate a very large proportion of medications in use today. However,
   the basis for the higher dosage requirement is not understood. These
   genetic differences can have serious clinical consequences,
   particularly in chronic dosing situations. Knowledge that is acquired
   by studying the effects of inheritance in any selected group can also
   be used to improve the health of individuals with similar genetic
   characteristics who are members of other population subgroups.

   NIGMS' pharmacogenetics initiatives are designed to discern the role
   that human genetic variation plays in drug responses. The goal of the
   Pharmacogenetics Research Network and Knowledge Base is to
   systematically collect and interpret information about inherited
   variations in humans that determine both therapeutic and adverse
   responses to medications. Basic scientific knowledge will be stored in
   an information repository (the PharmGKB) that is intended for research
   purposes. (For more information on NIGMS' pharmacogenetics initiatives,
   see http://www.nigms.nih.gov/pharmacogenetics.)

   Goal: Expand the scope of the Pharmacogenetics Research Network and
   Knowledge Base to aid in the discovery of genetic variations associated
   with clinically important variations in drug responses that occur
   across populations with different ethnic and racial backgrounds

     Actions: 1) Promote exploratory clinical studies to identify
     populations where functional genetic variation is believed to exist,
     and 2) Develop common resources for network usage, such as tissue
     sample banks, with samples obtained by appropriately informed
     consent. This will be done through competing supplements to
     cooperative agreements funded as part of RFA (request for
     applications) GM-99-004 "Pharmacogenetics Research Network and
     Knowledge Base." Funding will be provided for up to six supplements.

   appropriations levels: 5 percent, 10 percent, and 15 percent increases
   over the FY 2001 President's budget.

   NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository

   The NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository contains cell and DNA samples
   that allow investigators to study the causes of a large variety of
   genetic disorders, some of which affect minority populations
   disproportionately. Among these are samples for the study of
   adult-onset diabetes, sickle-cell anemia, and glucose-6-phosphate
   dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The repository also contains the DNA
   Polymorphism Discovery Resource, a set of 450 cell lines established in
   collaboration with the National Human Genome Research Institute,
   designed to reflect the genetic diversity of the U.S. population. This
   resource enables investigators to identify DNA sequence polymorphisms
   that serve as an important starting point in the search for genes
   involved in the etiology of complex genetic disorders. Some of these
   complex genetic disorders, such as cardio- and cerebrovascular disease,
   hypertension, obesity, asthma, prostate cancer, end-stage renal
   disease, and systemic (lupus) erythematosus lupus, occur
   disproportionately in African Americans.

   Goal: Provide a resource for investigators studying the etiology,
   diagnosis, and treatment of genetic disorders.

     Actions: Continue support for the Human Genetic Cell Repository.

     Ongoing Funding Levels: This is support for a broad, ongoing
     program. Portions directly related to reducing health disparities
     cannot be estimated.

   Complex Genetic Diseases

   Heritable traits, including genetic disorders and susceptibility to
   disease, tend to arise and concentrate in specific populations, often
   in response to an environmental stress. For example, there is strong
   evidence that the genes for genetic disorders, among them sickle-cell
   anemia, Tay-Sachs disease, and cystic fibrosis, served to protect
   populations from infectious diseases. Genetic and environmental
   differences between populations, both present and past, are part of the
   equation that explains health disparities. As more data on genetic and
   environmental differences become available, the challenge will be to
   interpret it correctly. Studying the architecture of traits,
   particularly complex ones, such as cardiovascular diseases, asthma, and
   obesity, that differ among populations, requires the application of
   mathematical and statistical models that account for current genetic
   information and past population history. Current models only account
   for a fraction of the information needed to fully understand the
   genetics of traits related to health disparities.

   Goal: Provide greater understanding of the architecture of traits
   related to health disparities through mathematical and statistical
   approaches.

     Actions: Provide support for genetic research using these
     approaches.

     Ongoing Funding Levels: This is support for a broad, ongoing
     program. Portions directly related to reducing health disparities
     cannot be estimated.

   Differences in the Response to Injury

   Unintentional injuries and subsequent adverse effects are the fifth
   leading cause of deaths in the United States for all ages. Intentional
   injuries (excluding suicide) rank thirteenth. Data from the Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention show that injury-related death rates are
   greater for underrepresented minorities (African Americans, Hispanics,
   and American Indians and Alaska Natives) than for Caucasians. While
   access to appropriate medical care is likely to be an important factor
   in these differences, the question of whether underlying differences
   exist between racial or ethnic groups in the physiological response to
   injury remains to be adequately addressed.

   Studies with animal models are just beginning to find discrete genetic
   reasons for differing responses to injuries. Also, studies have
   demonstrated real and clinically important variations in the responses
   to defined injury based on gender differences. Preliminary clinical
   studies on humans have suggested that there are several potential
   mechanisms that could explain gender or racial differences to injury.
   For example, genetic deficiency in one enzyme has been linked to high
   morbidity and mortality in severely injured African-American males.
   Also, the sex-linked hormones estrogen and testosterone have been
   independently associated with different mechanisms altering responses
   to injury. More study is required to discover and fully delineate
   mechanisms responsible for how different populations respond to a
   similar challenge.

   It has long been believed that pain perception has a strong cultural
   component. While the control of pain is an extremely broad topic,
   whether there is a gender, racial, or ethnic difference in pain
   perception and therapeutic modulation following burn injury is not
   known. Such studies are seriously hindered by the limited number of
   burn victims treated by individual burn centers, which may also have
   skewed demographics. Thus, a widespread, multi-center assessment of
   post-burn pain is required to provide the essential data required to
   answer the question in this specific group of injury victims.

   Beyond the immediate post-injury period, gender, racial, or ethnic
   characteristics may influence the restoration and repair of tissue as
   well. For example, keloid formation remains a serious problem during
   wound healing for many members of underrepresented minority groups.
   Severe burn victims now routinely survive, and their future quality of
   life may be significantly enhanced if the repaired tissues closely
   match their natural texture and tone.

   Goal: Determine the genetic basis for the host response to injury, with
   particular reference to genes known to be prevalent in underrepresented
   minority populations.

     Actions: Issue a program announcement requesting new R01 or P01
     applications for research to either assign relative importance of
     already known allelic differences to all aspects of the injury
     response or discover new allelic differences yielding diverse
     responses. Also, enhance the ability of existing grants
     (particularly those with ongoing human studies, including research
     center grants) using appropriate model or experimental systems to
     include determination of the genetic basis for the host response to
     injury. Either individual grants or groups of several linked to
     promote collaboration may be appropriate. Applications will be
     solicited through a program announcement offering competing
     supplements to existing applications and mechanisms to foster
     integrative and collaborative projects ("glue grants").


     Anticipated Funding Levels: Level FY 2002 Funding
                                 5%    $1.0 Million
                                 10%   $2.0 Million
                                 15%   $2.0 Million

   Goal: Assess whether the perception and management of pain following
   burn injury differs based on gender, racial, or ethnic factors or
   whether it is entirely individualized.

     Actions: Provide support to establish a network between existing
     burn centers that will allow collection of uniform data on the
     quantity and quality of post-burn pain throughout the prolonged
     recovery period and across gender and racial lines.


     Anticipated Funding Levels: Level FY 2002 Funding
                                 5%    $2.0 Million
                                 10%   $2.0 Million
                                 15%   $2.0 Million

   Goal: Encourage research on the molecular and cellular basis of keloid
   formation, mechanisms of severe wound contraction, and the means to
   allow skin grafts to regain pre-burn appearance, emphasizing the need
   to expand into considerations of unique properties and characteristics
   of the skin of subpopulations.

     Actions: Release a program announcement requesting new applications
     in this area.


     Anticipated Funding Levels: Level FY 2002 Funding
                                 5%    $500,000
                                 10%   $1.0 Million
                                 15%   $1.0 Million

   Differences in Response to Anesthetics among Ethnic or Racial Groups

   In recent years, there has emerged a growing body of literature on
   patient response to pain and pain-modulating drugs (prostaglandins,
   alcohol, beta-blockers, psychotropics) based on gender and ethnicity.
   In contrast, there are virtually no studies to date exploring the
   effects of either gender or ethnicity on patient responses to the
   administration of anesthetic agents, despite the fact that anesthesia
   is administered to over 20 million patients annually.

   Differences may exist in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
   anesthetic agents among ethnic groups and could contribute to
   variability in depth of anesthesia, emergence from anesthesia, and
   incidence of side effects. Particularly in severely ill patients
   undergoing surgery, even subtle differences in how individuals
   metabolize and respond to these drugs could be magnified and result in
   increased morbidity and mortality. There is a clear need to explore the
   potential racial or ethnic differences in response to anesthetic drugs
   and insure that these drugs are administered to all patients with
   maximum efficacy and safety.

   Goal: Encourage currently funded investigators to expand the scope of
   their projects to include studies that explore possible racial- or
   ethnic-based differences in patient responses to anesthetics. Also
   stimulate new applications and studies in this area.

     Actions: Issue a program announcement in this area, soliciting
     competing supplements to ongoing funded grants. Provide funding for
     up to six supplements. Also, issue a program announcement to expand
     the number of new R01 research projects in this area. Provide
     funding for up to five new R01 applications.


     Anticipated Funding Levels: Level FY 2002 Funding
                                 5%    $1.2 Million
                                 10%   $1.5 Million
                                 15%   $1.8 Million

Research Infrastructure

   One of the ways in which NIGMS addresses the issue of health
   disparities is through its programs to increase the number and
   capabilities of underrepresented minority biomedical scientists, some
   of whom can be expected to pursue research related to health
   disparities in minority populations. The focal point for this effort
   within the Institute is the Division of Minority Opportunities in
   Research (MORE). The MORE Division has three components: the Minority
   Biomedical Research Support (MBRS) Branch, the Minority Access to
   Research Careers (MARC) Branch, and a section that handles special
   initiatives.

   The MBRS Program has recently undergone reorganization and has
   experienced an increase in the number of institutions that are eligible
   for research and institutional development support due to their
   substantial minority student enrollments. Along with this increase in
   the number of potential applicants for MBRS grants has been a rise in
   the average size of requested grant awards, making these grants
   comparable in size to most NIGMS research grants. As a result, MBRS'
   needs have grown substantially, and NIGMS has allocated additional
   resources to it. The MBRS Program comprises three subcomponents: the
   Support of Continuous Research Excellence (SCORE) initiative, the
   Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement (RISE), and the
   Initiative for Minority Student Development (IMSD).

   Together, the MORE programs cover the educational spectrum from the
   undergraduate level to the postdoctoral level, by providing support in
   two broad areas of need: institutional development and student and
   faculty training and career development. The goal of MORE's
   institutional development support is to enhance the science curricula
   and faculty research capabilities at institutions with substantial
   minority enrollments. The goal of MORE's support for training and
   career development is to encourage minority students to pursue training
   for scientific careers and strengthen the research skills of minority
   students and faculty. The wide range of opportunities provided by these
   programs allow for the participation of all types of institutions, from
   2-year colleges to research-intensive institutions with doctoral
   programs.

   Ongoing Institutional Development

   Goal: To enhance the science curricula and faculty research
   capabilities at institutions with substantial minority enrollments.

     Actions: Support institutional development through two NIGMS
     programs, SCORE and an Information Technology Infrastructure
     Development Program.

     SCORE. The purpose of the SCORE Program is to develop biomedical
     research faculty at minority-serving institutions that are committed
     to improving competitive research programs and increasing the number
     of underrepresented minorities professionally engaged in biomedical
     research. This is achieved by providing financial assistance to
     competitive developing research programs in all areas of biomedical
     and behavioral research at institutions with significant
     underrepresented minority student enrollment. The program supports
     faculty-initiated, scientifically meritorious research projects,
     including pilot research projects.

     Information Technology Infrastructure Development. NIGMS plans to
     continue a communications and technology grant supplement program to
     enable MBRS-supported institutions to develop or upgrade an
     Internet/Intranet communications infrastructure that will strengthen
     their research and research training capabilities. At present, many
     minority institutions are still without Internet/Intranet
     communication capabilities. This is a shortcoming that greatly
     hampers research at these institutions. This program will provide
     support for six to eight institutions each year.

     Ongoing Funding Levels for Institutional Development:


       Level FY 2002 Funding
       5%    $56.6 Million
       10%   $59.3 Million
       15%   $62.0 Million

   Ongoing Training and Career Development

   Goal: To encourage minority students to pursue training for scientific
   careers and strengthen the research skills of minority students and
   faculty.

     Actions: Provide support for training and career development through
     several new and ongoing programs.

     RISE. RISE seeks to enhance the research environment at
     minority-serving institutions through faculty and student
     development. The overall goal is to increase the interest, skills,
     and competitiveness of students and faculty in pursuit of biomedical
     research careers. The program offers support for faculty and student
     development activities, which can include on- or off-campus
     workshops, specialty courses, travel to scientific meetings, and
     research experiences at on- or off-campus laboratories. Support is
     available for evaluation activities as well. RISE also offers some
     support for institutional development, which includes limited funds
     for the renovation or remodeling of existing facilities to provide
     space for an investigator to carry out developmental activities,
     limited equipment purchases, and the development of research
     courses.

     IMSD. IMSD encourages domestic private and public educational
     institutions with fully developed and funded research programs to
     initiate and/or expand innovative programs to improve the academic
     and research capabilities of underrepresented minority students and
     to facilitate their progress toward careers in biomedical research.
     The application may be directed toward the development of
     underrepresented minority scientists who are in any phase of their
     career development, from the undergraduate level through the Ph.D
     level. Awards under this program use the institutional education
     project grant mechanism.

     MARC Training and Fellowships. MARC supports special research
     training opportunities for students and faculty at educational
     institutions with substantial minority enrollments. MARC programs
     also enable grantee institutions to develop and strengthen their
     biomedical research training capabilities. As a result, these
     schools are able to interest students in, and prepare them for,
     pursuing doctoral study and biomedical research careers.

     MARC accomplishes these goals through Undergraduate Student Training
     in Academic Research (U*STAR) institutional grants, predoctoral
     fellowships, faculty predoctoral and senior fellowships, a visiting
     scientist program, and grants for MARC ancillary training
     activities. Like MBRS, MARC announced one-time supplemental grants
     for communications and technology in FY 1998.

     In addition to the programs described above, MARC has formed
     relationships with professional scientific societies to develop
     innovative programs aimed at increasing the number of
     underrepresented minority biomedical scientists. These societies
     include the American Society for Cell Biology, the American Society
     for Microbiology, the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native
     Americans in Science, and the Federation of American Societies for
     Experimental Biology. With MARC support, the societies have
     sponsored activities that engage minority students and faculty
     members in the biomedical sciences, including visiting scientist
     programs, summer research opportunities, and scholarships enabling
     attendance at national scientific meetings and conferences.

     National Predoctoral Fellowships for Minorities. NIGMS also
     participates in an NIH-wide program providing predoctoral fellowship
     support for minorities. The National Research Service Award
     Predoctoral Fellowship for Minority Students provides up to 5 years
     of support for research training leading to the Ph.D. or equivalent
     research degree; the combined M.D./Ph.D. degree; or other combined
     professional degree and research doctoral degree in the biomedical
     or behavioral sciences or in health services research. These
     fellowships are designed to enhance the racial and ethnic diversity
     of the biomedical, behavioral, and health services research labor
     force in the United States. Accordingly, academic institutions are
     encouraged to identify and recruit students from underrepresented
     racial and ethnic groups who can apply for this fellowship.

     IRACDA. In FY 1998, NIGMS announced a new program that is designed
     to facilitate the progress of postdoctoral candidates toward
     research and teaching careers in academia. The Institutional
     Research and Academic Career Development Award (IRACDA) combines a
     traditional mentored postdoctoral research experience with an
     opportunity to develop teaching skills through mentored assignments
     at a minority-serving institution (MSI). The goals of the program
     are to provide a resource to motivate the next generation of
     scientists at MSIs and to promote links between research-intensive
     institutions and MSIs, which can lead to further collaborations in
     research and teaching.

     Bridges to the Future. One special initiative supported by NIGMS is
     the Bridges to the Future Program, which is co-sponsored by NIGMS
     and the NIH National Center on Minority Health and Health
     Disparities. The mission of the Bridges to the Future program is to
     make available to the biomedical science research enterprise and to
     the nation the intellectual talents of an increasing number of
     underrepresented minority group members. It does so by facilitating
     the transition of students from associate to baccalaureate
     degree-granting institutions and from master's to doctoral
     degree-granting institutions. The program promotes effective
     inter-institutional partnerships that lead to improvement in the
     quality and quantity of underrepresented minority students being
     trained as the next generation of scientists. Examples of activities
     supported through the Bridges Program include laboratory research
     experiences, mentoring and academic counseling programs, curriculum
     enrichment, visiting lectureships, and course development.

     Research Supplements for Underrepresented Minorities. As part of an
     NIH-wide program, principal investigators holding NIGMS research
     grants may request supplemental funds to support minority scientists
     and students. The aim of these supplements is to attract and
     encourage minority individuals to pursue biomedical research
     careers. Any principal investigator at a domestic institution
     holding an active NIGMS research grant, program project grant,
     center grant, or cooperative agreement research program grant, with
     a reasonable period of research support (usually 2 years or more)
     remaining at the time of the supplemental award, is eligible to
     submit a request to NIGMS for an administrative supplement to the
     grant.

     Ongoing Funding Levels for Student and Faculty Training and Career
     Development:


       Level FY 2002 Funding
       5%    $64.9 Million
       10%   $67.8 Million
       15%   $70.6 Million

   National Research Service Award (NRSA) Institutional Research Training
   Programs

   In addition to the MORE training and career development programs, NIGMS
   also provides training support through its traditional NRSA training
   programs. All Institute-supported training programs are required to
   establish acceptable minority recruitment plans to encourage the
   participation of underrepresented minority students in traditional
   research training grants. These recruitment efforts are an integral
   part of the Institute's ongoing research training programs, and their
   costs cannot be separated from NIGMS' total research training budget.

   New Training and Career Development Initiatives

   Post-Baccalaureate Training

   NIGMS is developing a proposal to establish a new program, the
   Post-Baccalaureate Apprentice Scientist Award, to encourage
   underrepresented minority students who hold a baccalaureate degree in
   the biomedically relevant sciences to pursue a research doctorate after
   postponing their application to graduate school. The purpose of this
   program is to maintain the interest of post-baccalaureate participants
   in scientific research and to promote and instill an interest in
   research on health disparities. Participation in this program is
   expected to facilitate the development of a cohort of researchers who
   will address health problems disproportionately affecting minorities
   and the medically underserved.

   Goal: Maintain and promote baccalaureates' interest in scientific
   research and encourage them to continue on to graduate school.

     Action: Issue a program announcement for applications for this type
     of program.


     Anticipated Funding Levels: Level FY 2002 Funding
                                 5%    $2.7 Million
                                 10%   $2.9 Million
                                 15%   $3.2 Million

   Collaborations with Other Agencies

   The MORE Division is also developing plans to collaborate with the
   Indian Health Service to improve and expand health research involving
   American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and people. This collaboration
   is expected to enhance and expand the capacity and skills of tribal
   organizations and Native American researchers to conduct high-quality
   biomedical and behavioral health research and to apply successfully for
   competitive research grants.

   Goal: Increase the capacity and skills of tribal organizations and
   Native American researchers, allowing them to conduct high-quality
   research.

     Action: Establish collaborative programs with the Indian Health
     Service.


     Anticipated Funding Levels: Level FY 2002 Funding
                                 5%    $2.1 Million
                                 10%   $2.2 Million
                                 15%   $2.3 Million

Public Information/Outreach

   Outreach and Technical Assistance to Minority-Serving Institutions

   The recent restructuring of the MBRS Program and new MORE initiatives
   have resulted in an increase in the number and frequency of staff
   outreach visits to explain new program requirements, review incoming
   applications, and monitor ongoing programs. In addition, NIGMS staff
   have made presentations at several regional workshops targeted at
   minority-serving institutions not currently funded by NIGMS to
   introduce the workshop participants to NIH and NIGMS and to familiarize
   them with the Institute's efforts to recruit minorities into science
   careers. NIGMS also provides outreach through several Web sites
   designed to provide information on ongoing NIGMS minority programs and
   initiatives. In addition to staff outreach efforts, NIGMS provides
   extramural funding for technical assistance activities performed by
   third parties, such as professional societies.

   Goal: Provide minority-serving institutions with the knowledge and
   assistance required to take advantage of research and training
   opportunities for underrepresented minorities at NIGMS and NIH.

     Action: Continue outreach and technical assistance activities.


     Ongoing Funding Levels: Level FY 2002 Funding
                             5%    $1.4 Million
                             10%   $1.5 Million
                             15%   $1.6 Million

   Pharmacogenetics Populations Advisory Group

   As a part of NIGMS' pharmacogenetics initiatives, a Pharmacogenetics
   Populations Advisory Group was assembled to consider possible areas of
   misunderstanding and the ramifications of such research. It is
   important and necessary to consider issues of stereotyping and
   stigmatization of communities, as well as any possible resulting harm
   to individuals (e.g., discrimination in access to various social
   benefits) that may arise from membership in an identified group.
   Members of the advisory group, as well as participants in several
   follow-up focus groups, believed that the likely benefits of
   pharmacogenetics research outweighed the risks. However, they
   recommended that a clear statement be provided to the public on the
   goals of the research and the issues involved (which was developed by
   NIGMS as a brochure intended for a lay audience). They recommended that
   NIGMS ensure that the appropriate mechanisms are in place to maintain
   privacy and confidentiality. They also urged a continued dialogue on
   this topic.

   Goal: Expand the role of the NIGMS Pharmacogenetics Populations
   Advisory Group, in conjunction with the Pharmacogenetics Research
   Network and Database. Encourage bi-directional exchange of ideas and
   advice between members of the advisory group, or their designees, and
   collaborative centers funded through the Pharmacogenetics Research
   Network and Knowledge Base.

     Action: Award administrative supplements to support partnerships in
     which an individual from the advisory group attends twice-a-year
     meetings at a collaborative center site (this could lead to a model
     for a competing supplement program, if sufficient interest
     develops). Up to eight travel awards, administered from the
     collaborative sites, would be funded each year.


     Anticipated Funding Levels: Level FY 2002 Funding
                                 5%    $30,000
                                 10%   $30,000
                                 15%   $30,000

   Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues in Genetic Research

   It is recognized that people of different ethnic and geographic
   backgrounds may have different alleles of genes that predispose them to
   complex genetic disorders, and identifying such genes would be valuable
   for diagnosis and development of therapies. However, studies on members
   of specific populations raise the possibility of discrimination,
   stigmatization, and stereotyping. NIGMS has taken the lead in efforts
   to develop approaches that would permit investigators to conduct these
   important genetic studies while protecting the subjects and the
   populations from which they come from negative impact. To this end,
   NIGMS held a meeting in July 1999 that led to the concept of special
   oversight groups that would assure that tissue samples are acquired and
   studied with due protections for the population. A large, follow-up
   meeting titled "Community Consultation on the Responsible Collection
   and Use of Samples for Genetic Research" will be held in the summer of
   2000. This meeting is designed to seek input and advice from many
   members of various ethnic groups on the concept of oversight groups.

   Goal: Develop approaches to permit investigators to conduct genetic
   studies while protecting the subjects and the populations from which
   they come from negative impact.

     Action: Explore concept of oversight groups and other approaches to
     assure that tissue samples are acquired and studied with adequate
     protections for populations.
