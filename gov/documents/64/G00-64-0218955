   Educational Outreach

   NASA's Strategic Plan calls for the Agency to "foster partnerships with
   teachers and students". The NASA Implementation Plan for Education
   states "We involve the educational community in our endeavors to
   inspire America's students, create learning opportunities, and
   enlighten inquisitive minds". The IV&V Facility has aligned its
   Educational Outreach program to support these agency-wide strategies.
   The educational mission of the IV&V Facility is to inspire young and
   old alike, to broaden their perspectives on the future, and to bring to
   them the experience and richness of space science.
   The Educational Outreach initiatives of NASA are an integral part of
   the IV&V Facility's mission. The IV&V Facility provides access to NASA
   learning materials via its Educator Resource Center (ERC). The ERC is a
   resource library, which allows educators to enhance their existing
   curriculum with information generated by NASA programs, technologies,
   and discoveries.
   Another main focus of the IV&V Facility Educational Outreach is to
   provide opportunities to participate in internship programs by high
   school students. These internships increase student understanding of
   scientific processes through direct experience under the guidance of
   computer scientist, engineers who serve as mentors.
   The IV&V Facility is fully committed to investing resources in the
   educational outreach arena with educational programs that seek to
   actively engage students, teachers, and parents in our projects and
   programs to enhance knowledge and to contribute to the NASA mission.
