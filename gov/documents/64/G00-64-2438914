   Aetna Foundation
          Grants from $1,000 to $270,000 have been made in recent years by
          the Aetna Foundation for projects that improve the performance
          of at-risk young people, which address issues of systemic
          reform, and broaden students' academic and career horizons.
          Aetna has some preference for projects that deal with the
          transition between middle grades and high school and between
          high school and college. Aetna has fifteen "focus regions"
          across the nation through which it made grants outside the
          immediate Hartford, Connecticut area.

          development effort and to integrate lessons learned from these
          efforts into ongoing teacher training programs. PIE 3 grants
          will consist of Apple hardware, software, telecommunications,
          and a 10-day professional development retreat for five-member
