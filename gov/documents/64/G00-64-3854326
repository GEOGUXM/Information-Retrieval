   Whats new at the Internal Revenue Service? Its "News for You 2002."

   "News for You 2002" highlights the many changes taking place at the IRS
   since the agency undertook the largest reorganization effort in nearly
   50 years. It represents a renewed effort to keep taxpayers and tax
   practitioners informed of the latest events that directly affect them.

   "News for You 2002" contains 13 fact sheets outlining tax law and IRS
   changes to help individuals, businesses and tax practitioners. For
   example, many individuals and businesses will have new addresses to
   file their tax returns. Tax practitioners will have a new nationwide
   toll-free hotline number. And, some taxpayers may be eligible for
   additional tax relief.

   "For 2002, we are continuing the modernization process by making
   significant changes in our service center and other operations -
   changes we are confident will improve service to taxpayers," said IRS
   Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti.

   In an effort to better meet taxpayers needs, the IRS will begin
   processing tax returns at facilities dedicated to either business or
   individual taxpayers. "News for You 2002" contains a listing of new
   addresses where practitioners, businesses and taxpayers should mail
   returns and payments. Alternatively, "News for You 2002" also outlines
   the changes that make filing tax returns electronically easier than
   ever.

   Beginning January 2, tax professionals will be able to call a new
   toll-free nationwide support line. IRS customer service representatives
   trained to handle practitioners questions will staff the new
   Practitioner Priority Service. The telephone number, which will be
   distributed later to practitioners, will be available weekdays, 7:30
   a.m. to 5:30 p.m.

   "News for You 2002" also explains how those taxpayers who are eligible
   but did not receive the full amount of their advance credit payment may
   complete a worksheet in their tax package to claim the difference and
   reduce their tax liability. The advance refund payment was mailed to
   most taxpayers this summer.

   "News for You 2002" outlines changes in the alternative minimum tax,
   the child tax credit, the tax rate reduction and other new provisions
   enacted by Congress.
