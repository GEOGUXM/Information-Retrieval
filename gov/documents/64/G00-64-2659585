  Properties of Biological and Artificial Muscles/EAP

   What are muscles? - "Skeletal Muscle is a Biological Example of a
   Linear Electro-Active Actuator," Dr. Richard L. Lieber, UCSD (SPIE
   paper 3669-03)
   What are the names of human muscles? - Atlas of the Body The Muscles -
   Side View
   How is muscles compared with other actuators? - MIT's actuators
   comparison table
   How are EAP compared with other electroactive materials? - SRI
   International comparison tables/charts. These tables and charts are
   based on preliminary data. We would like to encourage the research
   community to challenge the data and help us make it as accurate as
   possible.

   Terminology
   Electrostriction - the none linear reaction of ferroelectric EAP
   (relating strain to E^2)
   EAP - general term describing polymers that respond to electrical
   stimulation
   Electronic EAP - polymer that change shape or dimensions due to
   migration of electrons in response to electric field (usually dry)
   Ionic EAP - polymer that change shape or dimensions due to migration of
   ions in response to electric field (usually wet and contains
   electrolyte)
   Longitudinal EAP - polymer that responds with change in length
   Bending EAP - polymer that responds with bending (it may be the result
   of use of multiple layers as bimorph or inherent property)
