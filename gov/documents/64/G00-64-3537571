  Research Interests:

  Theoretical and computational aspects related to biomolecular dynamics and
  statistical mechanics.

   My main reaserch objectives are to understand the dynamics and
   stability of biomolecules. I have developed a method for extracting
   molecule's optimal dynamical coordinates (MODC) that best describe the
   biomoleule's fluctuations. These modes are non-linear in the sense that
   multiple basins of attraction are sampled during a molecular dynamics
   trajectory.

   Another aspect of my reasearch has been to develop Potentials of Mean
   Force that describe a biomolecule's hydration and ionic interactions.
   Our first application of the PMF approcah to describe the
   electrostatics of DNA stability, succesfully described ionic
   concentration and temperature dependence of salt-driven structural
   transitions of DNA oligomers. The application of the PMF to describe
   the structural hydration of biomolecules reproduces the hydration
   patterns of high resolution DNA and protein crystals. Currently the PMF
   approach is being extended to calculate conformational free energies.
