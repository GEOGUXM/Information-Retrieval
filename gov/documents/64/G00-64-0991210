   ammonia ice particles, he said, noting that "It is only because we got
   a clear shot of a fast-growing cloud in an unusually G a l i l e o
   turbulent region that we were able to see the ammonia ice crystals
   before their surfaces were altered." Planetary scientists have known
   that Jupiter contains lots of f i n d i n g s ammonia gas, because the
   gas absorbs certain wavelengths of light. Scientists would then expect
   that the low temperatures in Jupiter's outer atmosphere would cause the
   ammonia gas to condense into h i g h l i g h t ice. Until now,
   localized ammonia ice clouds have never been seen, despite the cold
   temperatures and the abundance of ammonia. Closer examinations by
   Galileo's spectrometer in May 1999 and p l a n e t a ry May 2000
   revealed that the spot was a heavy concentration of am- monia ice
