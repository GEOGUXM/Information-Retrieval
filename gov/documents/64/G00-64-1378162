  “And I submit that as we live in times of change, we must be architects
          of that change or we will most certainly be its victims.

             John A Volpe, speech to the Western Association  of
         State Highway Officials, Salt Lake City, Utah, June 6, 1972



    Transportation Decision Making: A Policy Architecture for the 21st
   Century

   Economic globalization and economic growth, rapid technological change,
   and increasingly accessible information, streamlined government
   programs and privatization of many previous government functions will
   lead to new challenges and new opportunities.  Simultaneously,
   increasing environmental concerns including global climate change, and
   the conflict of globalization with local customs and priorities, are
   bringing greater awareness of future impacts into transportation
   decision-making.

   As part of a continuing effort to be both visionary and vigilant, the
   Department has taken steps to prepare the transportation industry for
   the next 25 years.  Secretary of Transportation Secretary Rodney A.
   Slater and each of the operating administration chiefs have been
   conducting an extensive series of meetings with stakeholders – both
   internal and external partners in transportation – in the Year 2000.
