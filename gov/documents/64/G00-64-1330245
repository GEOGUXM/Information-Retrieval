                                  About NPP
     __________________________________________________________________

   The purpose of the NPP series is to provide an informal regular forum
   for those interested in Nuclear and Particle Physics (NPP) and broadly
   related subjects, to meet and talk about their work, across the
   divisional and administrational boundaries which all too often divide
   us.

   The NPP talk is not intended to be another technical seminar. It is
   more important in the NPP venue to convey the goals and intrinsic
   interest of one's research to a general audience, rather than attempt
   to give technical detail suitable only for experts in the area.
   Accordingly, speakers are asked to limit their presentation to a
   maximum of 20 min., allowing another 10 min. for questions and
   discussion.

   Topics are not necessarily limited to Nuclear and Particle Physics, and
   in fact, some of the best attended and most interesting talks in the
   past couple of years were those given by people outside the NPP area.
   All are welcome to join us.

   The location alternates between TA-53, LANSCE, Rm. A234 and TA-3,
   Theoretical Div., Rm. 121 in order to draw upon both an experimental
   and theoretical audience. Generally, experimental talks are held in
   T-Div., while theoretical talks take place at LANSCE.

   The time of the NPP meeting is Friday afternoons at 4 pm., close to the
   end of the day, and beginning of the weekend. Coffee, tea and cookies
   or donuts are provided each week.

   The following people have agreed to act as NPP coordinators in their
   groups and areas of interest:
     *


    Anna Hayes, T-2
     *


    Peter Herczeg,T-5

    Michael Holzscheiter, P-23

   Automated e-mail announcements of NPP talks are sent out on Tuesday and
   Friday mornings of the week of the talk. Send e-mail to
   npp-admin@gita.lanl.gov if you would like to be added (or deleted) from
   our automated e-mail list. Alternatively, you may contact one of the
   NPP coordinators above, especially if you would like to give an NPP
   talk, know of someone (such as a visitor or collaborator) who would
   like to give a talk, or are interested yourself in acting as a NPP
   coordinator for your group or subfield of interest.
