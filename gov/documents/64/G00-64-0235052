   The Regional Plan is a joint undertaking by the City of Flagstaff and
   Coconino County addressing the long-term issues involved with our
   communities' growth and development. The Regional Plan is a
   comprehensive document which provides goals, policies, and strategies
   to provide guidance in determining where development will occur and
   areas that are to be protected as open spaces. The numerous systems,
   such as transportation, water, wastewater, stormwater, parks and
   others, needed to support development are anticipated and mapped and
   are included in the Regional Plan. It is a plan that will be used by
   both the City and County for a 525-square-mile area.

                       View the 1999 Draft Plan here.
