                              The SPDF Mission

   The mission of the Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF) is to enhance the
   scientific return from NASA programs in Space Physics including the
   disciplines of: Solar Physics; Cosmic and Heliospheric Physics;
   Magnetospheric Physics; and Ionospheric, Thermospheric and Mesospheric
   Physics. The SPDF will lead in the definition, development, and
   operations of data systems and services for space physics research,
   promote collaborative efforts in the collection and utilization of
   space physics data and models, and respond to the research needs of the
   space physics community. The SPDF will work closely with other elements
   of the Goddard Space Sciences Directorate, and with other organizations
   and groups, both within and outside NASA, to pursue the strategic
   objectives of the Directorate and of Goddard, and to contribute to the
   excellence of the NASA Space Physics Program.


   To address these goals, the SPDF will
     * Support current thrusts in NASA Space Physics programs (e.g.,
       ISTP/GGS) and their international extensions (e.g., IACG/IASTP)
          + In the design, development and implementation of innovative
            information systems to promote effective management,
            distribution and use of space physics data and models;
          + In the coordination and planning of science operations and
            data collection;
          + In the definition and promotion of standards and policies to
            ensure the generation and effective use of science data
            products;
          + In the organization and implementation of programs to enable
            national and international cooperation in addressing
            correlative science objectives.
     * Work to ensure that space physics data are properly archived and
       accessible
          + As an integral part of the SPDF support for the ISTP and IACG;
          + As part of the key role of the SPDF in the Space Physics Data
            System (SPDS);
          + As a partner of the National Space Science Data Center
            (NSSDC), as one element of the Space Science Data Operations
            Office (SSDOO), and with other GSFC organizations (e.g., the
            Solar Data Analysis Center).
     * Perform space physics and information systems research
          + To be knowledgeable of the needs of the space physics research
            community and to best apply the latest computer and
            information systems technologies to satisfy those needs;
          + To create or acquire space physics models and implement them
            into the appropriate data systems;
          + To verify and validate space physics data, data systems and
            models;
          + To contribute directly to the preeminence of NASA in space
            sciences and technology.
     * Communicate significant discoveries from the NASA space physics
       programs and advance science education
          + By publishing scholarly papers in scientific journals;

   By participating in scientific, public, and educational programs and
   forums, including appropriate cooperative graduate education and other
   training programs.
