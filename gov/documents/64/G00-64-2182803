                        SAPHIRE User Group Membership Information
         Support for the SAPHIRE software is available through the SAPHIRE Users
          Group at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory
                                        (INEEL).
           Note that submittal of this form does not commit you to anything or
         send any data to us. It simply allows you to view (and print from your
                   screen) a license agreement tailored to your needs.

          3. Click on the "Build Form" button to generate the appropriate
             license. Once the license is on screen, print the license
          4. On the printed license, fill in the "point of contact" information
          5. On the printed license, sign and date in the box and at the end of
             the license (note that distribution of SAPHIRE outside the U.S. may

         The User Group membership package will not be shipped until payment is
                                 received at the INEEL.
         The price of membership in the Users Group only covers our direct costs
          of providing support and material to end users. Since the INEEL is a
          national "cost-recovery" laboratory, we are not permitted to (and do
            not) maintain a "profit margin" on activities associated with the
                                  SAPHIRE Users Group.
           Details on the membership package are available for the following:
