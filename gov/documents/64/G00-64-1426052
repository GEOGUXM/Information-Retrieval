                                   About the DCL

      Goals:

      The Detector Characterization Laboratory (DCL) is a facility for the
      complete optical and electrical characterization of UV, optical, and
      infrared detectors. The goal of the DCL is to become a self-sufficient
      facility serving the needs of the GSFC scientific and engineering
      community, as well as academic and commercial customers.

      The laboratory currently supports the characterization of CCD's and
      HgCdTe detectors for the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3
      instrument. The laboratory resides in Room 83 of Building 20 at the
      Goddard Space Flight Center with support from Building 21, Code 685
      laboratories (Rooms 163 and G83).

      DCL Capabilities:

      The DCL provides flight detector screening and detailed
      characterization for WFC3 detectors. It is capable of extreme-accuracy
      characterization of a wide variety of imaging sensors. Examples of
      standard DCL procedures include:
        * Readout noise, dark current and other low-level noise source
          characterization using optimized readout systems.
        * Charge transfer efficiency measurements (using ^55Fe and other
          techniques).
        * Flat field uniformity measurements.
        * Absolute quantum efficiency (photometric calibration).
        * Spatial resolution and MTF including PSF and low-level halo.
        * Stability of detector characteristics.
        * Timing pattern generation and optimization.
        * Support for simultaneously measuring up to four detectors.
        __________________________________________________________________

      DCL Development:

      The DCL is a joint venture between Code 680 and Code 550.

   Code 550:

      The Instrument Technology Center (ITC) develops state-of-the-art earth
      and space science instrument components and systems. The center is part
      of the Applied Engineering and Technology Directorate at the Goddard
      Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland. It includes over 100
      engineers and technicians working in optics, detectors, lasers,
      microwave, and cryogenics, who work closely with earth and space
      scientists to develop technology that meets changing scientific needs.
      The ITC has developed and continues to maintain a large array of world
      class instrument facilities, together with the tools for developing
      instrument technology.

   Code 685:

      The Infrared Astrophysics Branch (Code 685) in the Laboratory for
      Astronomy and Solar Physics (LASP, Code 680) of the NASA/Goddard Space
      Flight Center supports a variety of space missions, suborbital
      missions, and detector development activities. Using these
      observational tools, its members explore the infrared sky in order to
      learn about the constituents of the early Universe and its origins.
