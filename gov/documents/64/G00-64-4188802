   The Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) serves as the all-sky
   monitor for the Compton Observatory, detecting and locating strong
   transient sources called gamma-ray bursts as well as outbursts from
   other sources over the entire sky. There are eight BATSE detectors, one
   facing outward from each corner of the satellite, which are sensitive
   to gamma-ray energies from 20 keV to over one thousand keV.
   At the heart of the BATSE detectors are NaI crystals which produce a
   flash of visible light when struck by gamma rays. The flashes are
   recorded by light-sensitive detectors whose output signal is digitized
   and analyzed to determine the arrival time and energy of the gamma ray
   which caused the flash. Each BATSE detector unit consists of a large
   area detector sensitive to faint transient events along with a smaller
   detector optimized for spectroscopic studies of bright events.
