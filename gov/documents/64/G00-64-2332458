     __________________________________________________________________

   The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics fulfills
   important review and advisory functions relative to health data and
   statistical problems of national or international interest, stimulates
   or conducts studies of such problems, and makes proposals for
   improvement of the Nation's health statistics and information systems.
   NCVHS has become increasingly active over the past several years,
   addressing issues relating to uniform health data sets, medical
   classification systems, the need for improved mental health statistics,
   data needs for minority health and the medically indigent, and State
   and community health data needs.

   Over its forty-eight year history, the Committee has stimulated a host
   of improvements in national and international health data and
   statistics. The Committee has been associated with ground-breaking
   contributions in such areas as disease classification, health surveys,
   health data sets and standards as well as privacy protection for health
   information.

   The 1990's have witnessed striking changes in health and health care
   and in health data and information systems. Both the national
   environment for health information systems and the nature of the
   information systems issues which the Department is confronting have
   changed dramatically. The new electronic information environment is
   raising new privacy issues and magnifying the importance of insuring
   that the Department's current policies are appropriate for new
   technologies.

   The 1996 revisions to the NCVHS charter and appointments of new members
   were designed to refocus the NCVHS to reflect these changes. Of
   particular concern is the lack of shared standards for health data.
   Consensus on such standards could dramatically reduce paperwork burdens
   and increase the analytic potential of health data. In addition,
   nationally uniform standards for the confidentiality of health
   information are required to assure the safety of the shared
   information. The NCVHS was given a broader role on these issues by the
   Health Insurance Portability and Accountabilty Act of 1996 which became
   P.L. 104-191.

   The NCVHS is in a unique position to serve as a national forum for the
   collaboration of interested parties, with the long-term goal of
   improving the compatibility of private sector, state, and federal
   health information systems while assuring the confidentiality of the
   information collected. In particular, the new charter enables the NCVHS
   to foster collaboration on voluntary means to facilitate and accelerate
   the development of consensus across the public and private sectors
   around these key data standards and privacy issues.

   The Committee informs HHS data policy decision-making as well as
   private sector and State data policy decision-making. Participants
   bring their expertise, perspectives, and concerns to the Committee, and
   bring back to their respective industries and organizations the
   collective recommendations and rationale of the Committee.

  Membership:

   The Committee is composed of 18 individuals distinguished in the fields
   of health statistics, electronic interchange of health care
   information, privacy and security of electronic information,
   population-based public health, purchasing or financing health care
   services, integrated computerized health information systems, health
   services research, consumer interests in health information, health
   data standards, epidemiology, and the provision of health services.
   Sixteen of the members are appointed by the Secretary of HHS for terms
   of four years each; with about four new members being appointed each
   year. Early each year, a Federal Register Notice announces the openings
   to be filled and invites nominations. An ad hoc selection committee is
   convened to review the letters of nomination and the curriculum vitae
   of those nominated. A slate of the most highly qualified people is
   reviewed by the HHS Data Council and recommendations are made to the
   Secretary for appointment. In the selection process, the Department
   gives close attention to equitable geographic distribution and to
   minority and female representation. Appointments are made without
   discrimination on the basis of age, race, gender, sexual orientation,
   HIV status, cultural, religious or socioeconomic status. Two additional
   members are selected by Congress.
