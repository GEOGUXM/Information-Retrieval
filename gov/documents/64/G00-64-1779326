          Statement of Congressman Sanders on 1/29/2002 regarding:
            Response to the President's State of the Union Speech

   The President laid out many ideas tonight, some of which I firmly agree
       with. Given that Vermont borders Canada, I want to see a strong
     homeland defense program, including increased resources for border
    security and protections against attack, especially against nuclear,
                      biological and chemical threats.

      However, I strenuously disagree with the Presidents plan to make
   permanent the $500 billion in tax breaks that will go to the wealthiest
    one percent over the next ten years - people with a minimum income of
    over $350,000 a year. In my view, with a $6 trillion national debt, a
    growing deficit, and the government dipping into the Social Security
    Trust Fund, and with enormous unmet needs such as a prescription drug
      benefit under Medicare, veterans health care, affordable housing,
     special education funding and child care, these tax breaks for the
                        wealthy should be rescinded.
