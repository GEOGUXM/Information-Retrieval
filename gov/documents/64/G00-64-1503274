                              2.3 Locator Tutorial

   Location specific data output is provided by the Locator.

   At the heart of the Tabular Output system is the "Command Menu" which
   is displayed at the bottom of every screen. Users should be aware that
   the "Command Menu" should be their primary means of navigating through
   the Locator Tabular Ouput portion of the Satellite Situation Center.

   CAPTION: Standard Interface Command Menu

   As pictured above the menu is divided into four areas. The numbers
   beside each of the first three areas are intended to provide the user
   with a reminder of the order in which these options should be accessed.
   Each option will be described in detail in the following sections.

2.3.1 Spacecraft/Time Range Selection Screen

   The "Spacecraft/Time Range Selection" option presents the screen that
   is first displayed by the Locator Tabular Output.

   [Lscreen1.gif]

   CAPTION: Standard Interface Spacecraft Selection Screen

   This screen allows the selection of one or more spacecraft and an
   associated time range. See the section navigation tips for how to
   select more than one spacecraft. The date and time range may be entered
   in any combinations of the formats displayed below the "Time Range"
   label. Entering the time is also optional. If the time is not entered
   the system will assume a time of 00:00:00 hours.

   The time range specifed must be valid for ALL the selected spacecraft.
   To view the valid time ranges for all of the available spacecraft the
   user may select the image at the top of the page titled "Available
   Spacecraft and Times". This will display the Database Information Page.

  2.3.1.2 Database Information

   The Database Information option displays a list of the entire SSC
   database holdings, both on-line and off-line. In general, off-line data
   consists of all ephemeris data prior to 1991. To access off-line data,
   contact the user support office at the location specified in the
   Introduction to this guide.

   The list displays the satellite Name, Resolution of the ephemeris data
   in seconds, Time Range for which ephemeris data is available, and an
   indication of whether the data is Predictive or Definitive.

   This screen also provides the capability to reduce the volume of the
   tabular output. This is accomplished by changing the value in the field
   labeled:

   "Display1 out of every X points"

   This is refered to as the "Database Resolution Factor" and will cause
   the output to only print out every X^th point.

   Once the desired selections have been made on this screen the user
   should proceed to the "Output Options" screen via the button bearing
   the same name. If the parameters entered on the first screen are not a
   valid combination the user will be returned to the "Spacecraft/Time
   Range Selection Screen" with an appropriate error message displayed at
   the top.

2.3.2 Output Options

   The "Output Options" screen allows the user to specify what values will
   appear on the output screen.

   [Lscreen2.gif]

   CAPTION: Standard Interface Output Options Screen

   As shown in the figure above the user is presented with a wide array of
   options. Down the left hand side are the available coordinate systems
   that the software can format the output of the ephemeris data in. In
   the case shown the output will contain the XYZ, and Lat and Lon for
   both the GEI/TOD and the GEI/J2000 coordinate systems. The first two
   columns are provided as a short cut for selecting X,Y and Z as well as
   Lat and Lon for output. Selection of any of the additional options will
   result in those values being displayed on the output as well.

   The selection for output of GEO and/or GM coordinates of magnetic field
   line footpoints in either magnetic hemisphere (i.e. resulting from a
   north or south magnetic field line trace) may be obtained by selecting
   the appropriate checkboxes at the bottom of the screen. The field line
   in question is that which passes through a spacecraft at a given point
   in time. In addition to field line footpoints, the arc length of the
   line from the spacecraft to either footpoint can also be obtained.

   Once the user has selected the output for the locator run the system
   will produce valid output. The next sections are optional and deal with
   reducing the output by filtering on values that will be output by the
   software as well as the format of the output.

2.3.3 Filtering Options

   If the user selects "Filtering Options" the following screen will be
   displayed.

   [Lscreen3.gif]

   CAPTION: Standard Interface Filtering Options Screen

   This form allows one to specify constraints on the data that is to be
   generated. The components listed down the left side of the form pertain
   to the coordinate system whose name is displayed in the form's title.
   The contents of this form will change depending on what was selected
   for output on the "Output Options" screen.

   There are two types of filters.

   Those listed under the column labeled: "Return: Mns Mxs" when selected,
   allow one to have returned in the output the lines of data that contain
   the item which is the minimum and/or maximum value of its kind.

   Under the column labeled:

   "Return values that are..."
   "greater than: less than:"

   there are fields that allow one to specify a range in which the
   computed value must lie if it is to become part of the output.

    Regions Filter

   At the bottom of the screen there may be one or more "Region Filters"
   depending on what was selected on the "Output Options" screen.

   "Regions" denotes a naming convention of three dimensional and two
   dimensional zones that are associated with a spacecraft's location for
   a particular point in time. The "Regions Filter" section of the screen
   screen displays the four type(s) of regions that can be generated. The
   specific regions that constitute each region type are listed below.
   When in the 'Regions Filter' screen, a selection of a region type will
   display a selectable list of the regions specific to that region type.

   Selecting specific regions will constrain the displayed results to
   spacecraft locations that are in at least one of those selected regions
   for a particular region type. If the request "meet 'ALL' region
   filters" has been made, then the displayed results will be constrained
   to spacecraft locations that are in at least one of the selected
   regions OF EACH REGION TYPE for which specific regions have been
   specified.

     * SPACECRAFT REGIONS - (3 dimensional zones) Such a region is based
       on the spacecraft's position. A spacecraft can occupy only one
       region of this region type at any given time. A spacecraft region
       assignment can be one of the following:
          + Interplanetary medium,
          + Dayside Magnetosheath, Nightside Magnetosheath,
          + Dayside Magnetosphere, Nightside Magnetosphere,
          + Dayside Plasmasphere, Nightside Plasmasphere,
          + Plasma Sheet,
          + Tail Lobe,
          + LLBL (Low Latitude Boundry Layer),
          + HLBL (High Latitude Boundry Layer - formerly known as the
            Mantle)
     * RADIAL TRACED FOOTPOINT REGIONS - (2 dimensional zones) Such a
       region is based on the location on the Earth's surface where a
       straight line would intersect when connecting the spacecraft and
       the Earth's center. A radial traced region assignment can be one of
       the following:
          + North Polar Cap, South polar Cap,
          + North Cusp, South Cusp,
          + North Cleft, South Cleft,
          + North Auroral Oval, South Auroral Oval,
          + North Mid-Latitude, South Mid-Latitude,
          + Low Latitude
       Note: The North and South Mid-Latitude regions are defined as the
       two bands about the Earth that extend from: +30 degrees latitude to
       the North Auroral Oval, and -30 degrees latitude to the South
       Auroral Oval. The Low-Latitude is the band that extends from +30
       degrees latitude to -30 degrees latitude.
     * NORTH B TRACED FOOTPOINT REGIONS - (2 dimensional zones) Such a
       region is based on where the magnetic field line that passes
       through the spacecraft intersects the Earth's surface in the
       Earth's northern magnetic hemisphere. North B traced footpoint
       region assignments are the same as the 'North' regions and the Low
       Latitude region used for assigning a radial traced footpoint
       region.
     * SOUTH B TRACED FOOTPOINT REGIONS - (2 dimensional zones) Such a
       region is based on where the magnetic field line that passes
       through the spacecraft intersects the Earth's surface in the
       Earth's southern magnetic hemisphere. South B traced footpoint
       region assignments are the same as the 'South' regions and the Low
       Latitude region used for assigning a radial traced footpoint
       region.

2.3.4 Output Units/Formatting

   The Output Units/Formatting screen allows the user to select the format
   for the outputs for date, time, distance, degrees, and direction/range.

   [Lscreen4.gif]

   CAPTION: Standard Interface Output/Formatting Screen

   In addition the user can select the number of lines per page. The
   default as shown in the figure above shows a value of 1 line per page
   in the output. This value will produce one header for each column
   instead of every XX number of lines. If the user enters a 0 in this
   field the output will have no column headers.

   The user may also select to output the information into a CDF file.
   This will create as CDF file in the public FTP area. The user may then
   download this file.

                       2.5 The Locator Advanced Interface

   . The bottom line of the command menu contains a pair of radio buttons
   labeled "Interface Style: Standard Advanced". The button is defaulted
   to the Standard button. However, at any time the user can select the
   Advanced button and when the next page is loaded the advanced interface
   will be shown. There are several major differences between the Standard
   and Advanced interfaces. The changes revolve around the Command Menu
   and the number of options that are available for filtering.

   [Lcmdmenu2.gif]

   CAPTION: Advanced Interface Command Menu

   As shown in the above figure there are now several more choices under
   the "Optional Settings". These additional options are an expansion of
   the available filtering options. As shown in the next four figures the
   filtering options are expanded to allow you to filter on any of the
   avaiable output parameters whether or not that parameter is included in
   the output.

   [Lscreen5.gif]

   CAPTION: Advanced Interface Spacecraft/Time Range Selection Screen

   As shown in the figure the Spacecraft/Time Range Page has changed
   significantly. Upon closer examination though only on thing has really
   changed. Now instead of a single field to enter a "Database Resolution
   Factor" that applies to all spacecraft the user can specify a "Database
   Resolution Factor" for each spacecraft that is selected.

   [Lscreen6.gif]

   CAPTION: Advanced Interface Region Filter Screen

   As shown in the figure above you can now filter based on any of the
   available coordinate systems as apposed to just those selected for
   output.

   [Lscreen7.gif]

   CAPTION: Advanced Interface Region Filter Screen

   As shown in the figure above you can now filter based on any of the
   spacecraft region or trace region.

   [Lscreen8.gif]

   CAPTION: Advanced Interface Additional Filters Screen

   As shown in the figure above you can now filter based on any distance
   parameters or field values.
