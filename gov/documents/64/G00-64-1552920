   Landslides are an expensive, dangerous, and sometimes deadly geologic
   hazard in the San Francisco Bay region.

   Landslides can damage or destroy homes, roadways, and utility
   infrastructure costing millions of dollars and endangering lives.

   Landslides occur during a normal San Francisco winter, but can be
   especially numerous in an El Niño winter, which brings extra
   precipitation.

   In anticipation of landsliding associated with forecasts of heavy, El
   Niño precipitation in 1997-98, scientists and GIS specialists from the
   San Francisco Bay Landslide Team created maps to assess the hazard in
   the San Francisco Bay region.

   Following the intense 1997-98 El Niño event, scientists from the San
   Francisco Bay Region Project and the National Landslide Hazards Program
   conducted a field reconnaissance of the Bay area and found that 480
   damaging slides had caused $140 million in damage.

   Project members are continuing their study of slides in the Bay region
   by developing digital landslide distribution databases, landslide
   susceptibility maps, and computer models of landsliding.
