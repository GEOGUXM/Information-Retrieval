    [1. Dr. Minkoo Kim Joins the EE-IR Center ]

   We are pleased to welcome aboard a new member to the EE-IR Center
   initiative, Dr. Minkoo Kim, now employed as a Research Scientist at
   CACS. Author of numerous articles and presentations, Dr. Kim received
   his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Pennsylvania State University in
   1989. Dr. Kim was previously teaching in the Department of Information
   and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, Korea. His current
   research interests are intelligent information retrieval, intelligent
   character agents, and multimedia authoring.

    [2. Latest EE-IR Center Continuation Report on the Web ]

   Twice per year the Energy and Environmental Information Resources
   Center writes a "Continuation Progress Report." This report is sent to
   our project liaison, Dr. Dennis Traylor, at the Department of Energy's
   Office of Science, Technology & Information. The back issues of our
   reports are all available on the EE-IR Center Web site, at
   http://eeirc.nwrc.gov/pubs.htm . You can read the lastest report in
   .pdf format at the following address:

    [3. EE-IR Center, RAC, and LAGIC Meet to Discuss Collaboration ]

   On 20 August, Larry Handley, Brent Yantis, Nathan Handley, Suzanne
   Harrison, Dan Foley, Adam Chandler and Lynda Wayne met to discuss the
   relationship and possible cooperative activities between the NASA/USL
   Regional Applications Center, the Louisiana Geographic Information
   Center, and the Energy and Environmental Information Resources Center.

   The most obvious common thread between the three research groups is
   FGDC-compliant metadata. Since all three groups are involved in the
   production and distribution of metadata and data sets, there is a need
   therefore, to communicate and cooperate to eliminate duplicate effort.

   The EE-IR Center and RAC have a close working relationship already,
   primarily through the work of Suzanne Harrison, who is involved in both
   projects. Suzanne writes FGDC-compliant metadata for both groups and
   has completed six FGDC metadata records for data sets produced or
   housed at RAC. Her colleague, Dan Foley writes Dublin Core and Marc
   versions of these FGDC metadata records.

   The main topic discussed at the meeting was to decide which node should
   the EE-IR Center FGDC metadata be placed in. There are several options.
   The two most sensible choices we all agree are to either send the
   metadata records to LAGIC, or to create and operate a node running at
   RAC: this node would run the ISITE Z39.50 software, and would then be
   indexed and available through both the NBII and FGDC Clearinghouse
   sites, thus making the metadata and data sets therein described
   available through those additional access points. The LAGIC node is
   close to being online, and will house metadata created through the
   LOSCO and LSU teams to start. (A decision was made after the meeting to
   establish a RAC/EE-IR Center metadata node.)

   Nathan Handley, now employed by a private firm in Texas, proposed a
   model for metadata distribution within Louisiana that was discussed and
   critiqued.

    [4. EE-IR Center Joins Internet Scout Project as a Research Collaborator ]

   The EE-IR Center is pleased to report that a collaborative research
   relationship is being established with the Internet Scout Project. The
   Internet Scout Project is a National Science Foundation sponsored
   Internet information service based in the Computer Sciences Department
   at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.

   The EE-IR Center will be collaborating on their distributed metadata
   research initiative, called Isaac. The Isaac Network uses the
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). The EE-IR Center will be
   operating one of the first Isaac nodes. We will place our 250+ Dublin
   Core metadata records in the node server, thus providing ANOTHER access
   point to our high quality, subject-specific metadata. More detail on
   the project will appear in future issues of the EE-IR Center
   e-Newsletter.

    [5. Mid-South ASPRS Fall Meeting Info ]

   "Toolkits and Applications for Natural Resource Management" is the
   theme for the 1999 Mid-South Region of the American Society for
   Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing fall meeting. The meeting is being
   held at the University Center, Stephen F. Austin State University
   Nacogdoches, Texas, 7 - 8 October 1999.

   Larry Handley and Suzanne Harrison will be presenting a paper, titled
   "The Energy & Environmental Information Resources (EE-IR) Center: A
   Partnership in Spatial Data Handling."

    [6. Feature: Decimal Degree Conversion Tools ]

   Decimal Degree Conversion Tools
   By Dan Foley

   GIS specialists, map librarians, and others interested in geospatial
   data sets may want to convert decimal degrees (DD) to
   degrees-minutes-seconds (DMS) or vice versa (DMS to DD). This can be
   done with a calculator on many Windows PCs, by using converters
   available at two Internet sites, or by using mathematical formulas.

   The information here was submitted as responses to a question about
   decimal degree conversion posted to MAPS-L, the list of the American
   Library Association's Maps and Geography Round Table (MAGERT):

   I. Scientific Calculator

   The calculator on many Windows PCs has two formats: standard and
   scientific. The latter can be used for decimal degree conversion. Go to
   Start -> Accessories -> Calculator, then and select "Scientific" under
   View. (Information provided by Jenny Stone, GIS Librarian, Map
   Collection, University of Washington Libraries.)

   To convert DD to DMS, enter a latitude or longitude and click the "dms"
   button.

   Examples:

   Enter latitude of Lafayette, La. = 30.22389, click "dms" = 30.1326004 =
   30 deg 13'26.004"

   Enter longitude of Lafayette, La. = 92.01972, click "dms" = 92.0110992
   = 92 deg 01'10.992"

   To convert DMS to DD, enter a lat/long, check "Inv" box, then click
   "dms".

   Examples:

   Enter 30 deg 13'26" = enter 30.1326, "Inv", "dms" = 30.22389
   Enter 92 deg 01'11" = enter 92.0111, "Inv," "dms" = 92.01972

   II. Converters on the Internet
   There are at least two converters (DD to DMS and DMS to DD) available
   on the Internet, from the University of Northumbria and Vancouver Web
   sites. The latter also provides elevation in feet or meters and has a
   clickable map for approximate coordinates.

   University of Northumbria converter by Gary J. Park: DD to DMS:

   http://www.unn.ac.uk/~evgp1/gary/dec2deg.htm   and DMS to DD:
   http://www.unn.ac.uk/~evgp1/gary/deg2dec.htm   (Information provided by
   Mark Thomas, Public Documents & Maps, Perkins Library, Duke
   University.)

   Vancouver Web sites converter by Andrew Daviel:

   DD to DMS : http://vancouver-webpages.com/META/DD.html and DMS to DD:
   http://vancouver-webpages.com/META/DMS.html (Information provided by
   Mary Larsgaard, Map Librarian, University of California at Santa
   Barbara.)

   III. Mathematical formulas
   Bill Thoen of Computer Terrain Mapping, Inc. (http://www.ctmap.com)
   provides the following information:

   "Remember that there are 60 minutes in a degree and 60 seconds in a
   minute, or 3600 seconds to the degree. So to convert DD to DMS: First
   convert the sign to a direction. A negative longitude means "West";
   positive is "East". If the coordinate is latitude, a negative means
   "South"; positive is "North".

   D = int(DD) degrees
   M = int((DD-D)*60) minutes
   S = (DD-D+M/60)*60 seconds

   The int() function means "take the integer part of the result between
   the parentheses, and ignore the numbers to the right of the decimal
   point."

   So a coordinate of -105.234156, 39.978832 becomes 105 14 2.96 W, 39 58
   43.79 N

   To go back again it's: DD = D + M/60 + S/3600

   Another formula for DD to DMS conversion is given in "Map Use", by
   Muehrcke and Muehrcke (1992). (Information provided by Naomi Heiser,
   Map Library, University of Colorado Libraries.)

   Multiply decimal portion of degree by 60 to get minutes:
   Example: 39.54712 = .54712 x 60 = 32.83 minutes

   Multiply decimal portion of this number by 60 to get seconds:
   Example: .83 x 60 = 50 seconds

   Reconstruct degrees, minutes and seconds:
   Example: 39Â° 32' 50"

    [7. Article Link: "Satellite Justice: Ikonos as Legal Defense" ]

   One of the interesting challenges associated with the acquisition of
   satellite imagery is imagining practical applications for the data.
   Brent Yantis, Director of the NASA/ULL Regional Applications Center
   (where a steady stream of satellite data are pumping in) is responsible
   for finding wider applications for their data. (You may send your ideas
   to Brent Yantis or to the EE-IR Center Newsletter editor.)

   This week an article appeared on the space.com Web site about a San
   Francisco Bay area company, Visual Forensics, that is utilizing
   satellite imagery as evidence in legal cases, creating simulations by
   assembling satellite imagery in to moving pictures. The full-text of
   the article is on the Web:
