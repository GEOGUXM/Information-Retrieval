   I 107TH CONGRESS 1ST SESSION H. R. 1781 To require the Secretary of
   Energy to develop a plan for a magnetic fusion burning plasma
   experiment for the purpose of accelerating the scientific understanding
   and development of fusion as a long term energy source, and for other
   purposes. IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MAY 9, 2001 Ms. LOFGREN (for
   herself, Mr. NETHERCUTT, Mr. HALL of Texas, Mr. CUNNINGHAM, Mr. HOLT,
   Mr. CALVERT, Mr. GORDON, Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia, Mr. HONDA, Mr.
   ISSA, Mrs. THURMAN, Mr. DOOLITTLE, Mr. FILNER, Mr. WAMP, Ms. HARMAN,
   Ms. LEE, Mrs. DAVIS of California, Mr. BACA, and Mrs. TAUSCHER)
   introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on
   Science A BILL To require the Secretary of Energy to develop a plan for
   a magnetic fusion burning plasma experiment for the purpose of
   accelerating the scientific understanding and development of fusion as
   a long term energy source, and for other purposes. 1 Be it enacted by
   the Senate and House of Representa- 2 tives of the United States of
   America in Congress assembled, 3 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 4 This Act may
   be cited as the ``Fusion Energy 5 Sciences Act of 2001''. 2 1 SEC. 2.
   FINDINGS. 2 The Congress finds that- 3 (1) economic prosperity is
   closely linked to an 4 affordable and ample energy supply; 5 (2)
   environmental quality is closely linked to en- 6 ergy production and
   use; 7 (3) population, worldwide economic develop- 8 ment, energy
   consumption, and stress on the envi- 9 ronment are all expected to
   increase substantially in 10 the coming decades; 11 (4) the few energy
   options with the potential to 12 meet economic and environmental needs
   for the 13 long-term future must be pursued aggressively now, 14 as
   part of a balanced national energy plan; 15 (5) fusion energy is a
   long-term energy solution 16 that is expected to be environmentally
   benign, safe, 17 and economical, and to use a fuel source that is 18
   practically unlimited; 19 (6) the National Academy of Sciences, the 20
   President's Committee of Advisers on Science and 21 Technology, and the
   Secretary of Energy Advisory 22 Board have each recently reviewed the
   Fusion En- 23 ergy Sciences Program and each strongly supports 24 the
   fundamental science and creative innovation of 25 the program, and has
   confirmed that progress to- *HR 1781 IH 3 1 ward the goal of producing
   practical fusion energy 2 has been excellent; 3 (7) each of these
   reviews stressed the need for 4 the Fusion Energy Sciences Program to
   move for- 5 ward to a magnetic fusion burning plasma experi- 6 ment,
   capable of producing substantial fusion power 7 output and providing
   key information for the ad- 8 vancement of fusion science; 9 (8) the
   National Academy of Sciences has also 10 called for a broadening of the
   Fusion Energy 11 Sciences Program research base as a means to more 12
   fully integrate the fusion science community into the 13 broader
   scientific community; and 14 (9) the Fusion Energy Sciences Program
   budg- 15 et is inadequate to support the necessary science and 16
   innovation for the present generation of experiments, 17 and cannot
   accommodate the cost of a burning plas- 18 ma experiment constructed by
   the United States, or 19 even the cost of key participation by the
   United 20 States in an international effort. 21 SEC. 3. PLAN FOR FUSION
   EXPERIMENT. 22 (a) PLAN FOR UNITED STATES FUSION EXPERI- 23 MENT.-The
   Secretary of Energy (in this Act referred to 24 as ``the Secretary''),
   on the basis of full consultation with, 25 and the recommendation of,
   the Fusion Energy Sciences *HR 1781 IH 4 1 Advisory Committee (in this
   Act referred to as 2 ``FESAC''), shall develop a plan for United States
   con- 3 struction of a magnetic fusion burning plasma experiment 4 for
   the purpose of accelerating scientific understanding of 5 fusion
   plasmas. The Secretary shall request a review of 6 the plan by the
   National Academy of Sciences, and shall 7 transmit the plan and the
   review to the Congress by July 8 1, 2004. 9 (b) REQUIREMENTS OF
   PLAN.-The plan described 10 in subsection (a) shall- 11 (1) address key
   burning plasma physics issues; 12 and 13 (2) include specific
   information on the scientific 14 capabilities of the proposed
   experiment, the rel- 15 evance of these capabilities to the goal of
   practical 16 fusion energy, and the overall design of the experi- 17
   ment including its estimated cost and potential con- 18 struction
   sites. 19 (c) UNITED STATES PARTICIPATION IN AN INTER- 20 NATIONAL
   EXPERIMENT.-In addition to the plan de- 21 scribed in subsection (a),
   the Secretary, on the basis of 22 full consultation with, and the
   recommendation of, 23 FESAC, may also develop a plan for United States
   par- 24 ticipation in an international burning plasma experiment 25 for
   the same purpose, whose construction is found by the *HR 1781 IH 5 1
   Secretary to be highly likely and where United States par- 2 ticipation
   is cost effective relative to the cost and scientific 3 benefits of a
   domestic experiment described in subsection 4 (a). If the Secretary
   elects to develop a plan under this 5 subsection, he shall include the
   information described in 6 subsection (b), and an estimate of the cost
   of United 7 States participation in such an international experiment. 8
   The Secretary shall request a review by the National 9 Academy of
   Sciences of a plan developed under this sub- 10 section, and shall
   transmit the plan and the review to the 11 Congress by July 1, 2004. 12
   (d) AUTHORIZATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOP- 13 MENT.-The Secretary,
   through the Fusion Energy 14 Sciences Program, may conduct any research
   and develop- 15 ment necessary to fully develop the plans described in
   this 16 section. 17 SEC. 4. PLAN FOR FUSION ENERGY SCIENCES PROGRAM. 18
   Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment 19 of this Act, the
   Secretary, in full consultation with 20 FESAC, shall develop and
   transmit to the Congress a plan 21 for the purpose of ensuring a strong
   scientific base for 22 the Fusion Energy Sciences Program and to enable
   the 23 experiment decribed in section 3. Such plan shall include 24 as
   its objectives- *HR 1781 IH 6 1 (1) to ensure that existing fusion
   research fa- 2 cilities and equipment are more fully utilized with 3
   appropriate measurements and control tools; 4 (2) to ensure a
   strengthened fusion science the- 5 ory and computational base; 6 (3) to
   ensure that the selection of and funding 7 for new magnetic and
   inertial fusion research facili- 8 ties is based on scientific
   innovation and cost effec- 9 tiveness; 10 (4) to improve the
   communication of scientific 11 results and methods between the fusion
   science com- 12 munity and the wider scientific community; 13 (5) to
   ensure that adequate support is provided 14 to optimize the design of
   the magnetic fusion burn- 15 ing plasma experiments referred to in
   section 3; and 16 (6) to ensure that inertial confinement fusion 17
   facilities are utilized to the extent practicable for the 18 purpose of
   inertial fusion energy research and devel- 19 opment. 20 SEC. 5.
   AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 21 There are authorized to be
   appropriated to the Sec- 22 retary for the development and review of
   the plans de- 23 scribed in this Act and for activities of the Fusion
