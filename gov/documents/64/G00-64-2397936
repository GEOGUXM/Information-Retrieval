   The primary outlet for the Commissions recommendations consists of two
   reports, published in March and June of each year. Over the next two
   years, the Commission also will publish additional reports on a variety
   of subjects, as required under the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of
   1999. Topics will include quality improvement standards in traditional
   Medicare and Medicare+Choice plans and the regulatory burden of the
   Medicare program.

   In addition to these reports, MedPAC testifies frequently before the
   Congress on a range of Medicare issues, including the impact of policy
   changes under the Balanced Budget Act of 1999 (BBA), risk adjustment,
   problems facing rural hospitals, special Medicare payments, and
   accounting for new technology in hospital prospective payment systems.

   The Commission also submits formal comments on regulations issued by
   the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well
   as on reports to the Congress about Medicare payment policy. Recently,
   most of the Commissions comments have been in response to regulations
   implementing BBA policy changes.
