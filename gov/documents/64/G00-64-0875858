         Treasury Responsibilites in Investment Fund Administration

     The Department of the Treasury recently convened a Task Force to
     conduct a comprehensive review of the administration of trust and
     investment funds within Treasury, to document Treasury's role in the
     administration of these funds and to evaluate that role on the basis
     of appropriateness and efficiency. The result of the review was a
     report for the Secretary, " Treasury Responsibilities in Investment
     Fund Administration." The report details the group's evaluation of
     Treasury's fulfillment of these responsibilities, and it provides
     recommendations to enhance the Department's performance of its
     duties in certain key areas.
