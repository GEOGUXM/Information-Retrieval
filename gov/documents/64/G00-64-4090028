                          INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS
     __________________________________________________________________

   Written agreements between NIST and foreign agencies and organizations,
   known as international agreements (IAs) must be reviewed and cleared by
   the Deputy Chief Counsel to ensure that statutory authority exists for
   the proposed IA and that NIST's legal interests are protected. All
   proposed IAs must also be reviewed and cleared through the Office of
   International and Academic Affairs (OIAA), which has jurisdiction over
   NIST's cooperative activities with foreign countries. These two offices
   will coordinate their reviews to determine whether the proposed IA
   requires interagency review, which is conducted by the Department of
   State.

   The following international agreement (IA) types includes a description
   of the agreement, appropriate titles for specific instances and
   appropriate levels of signature.

   Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or Protocol: These title should only
   be used for binding agency-to agency international agreements that
   commit both parties to specific actions, such as the protection of
   intellectual property. This type of agreement is typically broad in
   scope and would cover any cooperative activity between NIST and the
   foreign entities. MOUs/Protocols must be signed by the Deputy Director
   of NIST or higher.

   Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA): An MRA should be used when NIST and
   the foreign laboratory or agency agree that they are competent to carry
   out a specific measurement or accreditation , and those measurement or
   accreditations will be acceptable in each others' countries. MRA's
   should be signed by the Deputy Director of NIST or higher.

   Cooperative Research Project (CRP): This title should be used when a
   research project commits both parties to specific activities but is not
   under a the auspices of a pre-existing MOU. This would be a binding
   project agreement. CRP's should be signed by the Laboratory Director or
   his/her designee.

   Implementing Arrangements or Project Annexes: Implementing Arrangements
   or Project Annexes should be used to describe a specific research
   project or activity under an existing MOU or Protocol. Implementing
   Arrangements or Project Annexes should be signed by the Laboratory
   Director or his/her designee.

   Statement of Intent or Statement of Interest: Statements of Intent or
   Statements of Interest indicate that the two sides intend to cooperate
   in areas of mutual interest, or to explore areas of mutual interest.
   This would not be a binding document and would not commit either party
   to any specific activity. Statement of Intent or Statement of Interest
   should be signed by the Division Chief or higher.

   Record of Discussion (RoD): These would be informal documents
   describing discussions that have taken place that do not commit either
   party to any specific activity. These should be used only when both
   parties agree that they would like some record of their discussions.
   RoD's should be signed by the principals involved.

   The following table is a list of NIST's international agreements.
