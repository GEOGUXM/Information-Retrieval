   The technology behind GPS is relatively simple. Each of the 24
   satellites, orbiting 11,000 miles above the surface of the earth, emits
   signals to receivers below. By measuring the travel time of a signal
   transmitted from each satellite, a receiver can calculate its distance
   from that satellite. Satellite positions are used by a receiver as
   precise reference points to determine the location of a receiver. When
   receiving the signals from at least 4 satellites, a receiver can
   determine latitude, longitude, altitude, and time. The basic GPS
   service provides users with approximately 100 meter accuracy 95% of the
   time anywhere on or near the surface of the earth.
