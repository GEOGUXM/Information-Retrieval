          Deadline Approaching for Annual Phoenix Kids Pride Award
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Jan. 23, 2001

     Do you know youth who are committed to community service? Then the
     organizers of the annual Phoenix Kids Pride Awards want to hear from
     you.

     For the eighth year, the awards program is seeking young people in
     the Phoenix area who have made community involvement a priority in
     their lives. The deadline for nominations is quickly
     approaching-March 18.

     At an awards ceremony each spring, young people are recognized for
     their ingenuity and leadership for organizing and participating in a
     variety of programs. Some have included counseling youth on
     resolving issues without violence, aiding pregnant teens, outreach
     to the homeless, fundraising for non-profit groups, neighborhood
     clean-ups and raising awareness for various causes.

     This year the awards program has been expanded to include Phoenix
     youth who are doing work on behalf of the national relief effort
     following the events of Sept. 11 and those who are working to
     benefit communities in other parts of the world.

     To be eligible for a Phoenix Kids Pride Award, candidates must
     either:

     1) live in Phoenix but conduct a volunteer campaign benefiting a
     neighboring community in the metro area, 2) live elsewhere in the
     Valley but do work that benefits Phoenix communities, 3) live in
     Phoenix and have the volunteer project benefit a Phoenix community
     or, 4) live in Phoenix and do work that benefits other parts of the
     world.

     Projects initiated by an individual or a group must have taken place
     between March 19, 2001 and March 18, 2002, the entry deadline.
     Self-submissions or nominations by parents or other adults are
     welcome.

     A panel of judges comprised of Phoenix residents and community and
     business leaders reviews the nominations. Each applicant receives a
     certificate of participation signed by Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza.

     The Phoenix Pride Commission's Kids Pride program honors dozens of
     Valley youth each year in grades K-12 and provides cash awards of
     $500. Since its inception, the program has awarded nearly $50,000.

     The sponsors of the program are St. Luke's Health Initiatives, which
     provides financial support; and the Arizona Diamondbacks, which
     hosts the annual awards ceremony at Bank One Ballpark in May and
     also donate game tickets to the winners.
