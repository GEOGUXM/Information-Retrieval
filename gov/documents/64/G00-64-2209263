                     Independent Investigator Proposals

   Independent investigators are invited to submit requests for beamtime
   at the Advanced Light Source by completing an Independent Investigator
   Proposal and Request for Beamtime Form for the general sciences or for
   protein crystallography. Guidelines for the completing this form,
   contact information, and a description of the review process are
   detailed below.
   Beamtime Cycles and Submission Deadlines

                  General Sciences Protein Crystallography
         Beamtime in the general sciences runs in two annual cycles:
     * June-November
     * December-May

     Rapid Access: Beamtime requests are now submitted and reviewed on a
       monthly basis. Beamtime cycles will also run on a monthly basis
                                 beginning:
     * Februrary 2002

                          Next Submission Deadline

         June 1, 2002, for beamtime from December 2002 to May 2003.

                              January 15, 2002
    Note: Protein crystallography beamtime requests must be submitted by
     the 15th of each month for beamtime beginning the following month.

   Guidelines

   Proposals may be for experimental programs or single experiments on
   existing beamlines. Allocation of beamtime for independent
   investigators is generally set at 25% of available time for bend-magnet
   beamlines, with the exception of Beamline 1.4, where 100% of available
   beamtime is allocated to independent investigators. The amount of
   available beamtime for independent investigators on insertion-device
   beamlines is determined in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
   established by each PRT for a specific beamline. Current available
   beamtime allocations, by beamline, are as follows:

     Beamline 4.0.2 - - 30%
     Beamline 5.0.2 - - 40%
     Beamline 7.0.1 - - 67%
     Beamline 8.0.1 - - 50%
     Beamline 9.0.2 - - 40%
     Beamline 10.0.1- -30%
     Beamline 12.0.1- -25%

   If a proposal specifies a particular beamline, the independent
   investigator must contact the appropriate Participating Research Team
   (PRT) spokesperson or the local contact (named in the individual ALS
   Beamline Tables) before submitting the proposal. In addition,
   investigators must contact the ALS User Services Office and the
   relevant PRT for permission to use any beamline endstations that are
   either independently owned or whose use is restricted. Special
   procedures must be followed to conduct proprietary research at the ALS.
   For more information, contact the ALS User Services Office (see below).

   Before submitting an Independent Investigator Proposal, it is
   recommended that principal investigators:
     * review the ALS Beamline Tables to learn about ALS beamlines'
       capabilities
     * contact ALS User Services Group Leader Gary Krebs (see below) for
       information about beamlines available to independent investigators
     * contact the PRT spokesperson or local contact listed in the
       individual ALS Beamline Tables to ask about individual beamlines
     * read Writing an Independent Investigator Proposal for the ALS:
       Guidelines from the Proposal Study Panels

   Proposal Review Process
   All submitted proposals are reviewed by:
     * ALS personnel for technical feasibility and safety
     * PRT members for conformance to the beamline's capabilities
     * the Proposal Study Panel (PSP), which rates the proposals following
       the criteria endorsed by the International Union of Pure and
       Applied Physics (IUPAP) in the IUPAP Recommendations for the Use of
       Major Physics Users Facilities, and makes recommendations on the
       requisite beamtime

   For an overview of the review process, see the Experiment Proposal and
   Review Path for Independent Investigators flowchart. Additional
   information about proposal procedures and policies is available in User
   Policy at the Advanced Light Source.

   Responses to the proposals are given about two months after the
   submission deadline. Each proposal is given a numeric rating that is
   then communicated to the investigator along with comments from the PSP.
   In some cases, a cutoff score, below which no beamtime is allocated, is
   determined for oversubscribed beamlines. This score will be published
   on the Web so that independent investigators may decide whether to
   rewrite their proposal, remove it, or keep it in the active pool. The
   most recent proposal scores for all beamlines and cutoff scores (where
   applicable) can be viewed at:
     * Independent Investigator Proposals: Scoring Information and Results
       for June 1, 2000 Submissions
       (General Sciences)
     * Independent Investigator Proposals: Scoring Information and Results
       for March 15, 2000, Submissions
       (Protein Crystallography)

    Allocating Beamtime for Independent Investigators

   Once all proposals have been reviewed and assigned a score, beamtime
   for independent investigators is scheduled by the ALS User Services
   Office in consultation with the beamline PRT spokesperson and the
   beamline scientist. This process is overseen by the Division Deputy for
   Science. The available beamtime is allocated according to the rank
   order of score, i.e., beginning with the best score and continuing
   until the beamtime allotment for independent investigators has been
   met. (Cutoff scores, below which no beamtime is allocated, vary by
   beamline.) A summary of the final beamtime allocations is sent to the
   relevant PSP, and the beamtime scheduling dates are finalized by the
   beamline scientist in consultation with users.

     Score Normalization
     On highly oversubscribed undulator beamlines, proposals that receive
     similar scores close to the cutoff score will receive beamtime in
     alternate cycles, i.e. , proposals near the cutoff score may be
     allocated beamtime only once each year or less. This procedure is
     maintained at the discretion of the PSP. For additional information
     and an example of this process, see Score Normalization in Beamtime
     Allocation.

    Maintaining an Active Proposal

   All proposals for beamtime will have the option to remain active for
   two years (i.e., four six-month cycles). Users can keep an ongoing
   proposal active by submitting a completed ALS Experiment Report and
   Request for Beamtime form by email to the ALS User Services Office. The
   form is in Rich Text Format (RTF) and can be saved to your hard disk,
   filled out, and attached in an email message with the key words
   "Experiment Report" in the subject header.

   Note: Only investigators who have ACTIVE proposals may submit an ALS
   Experiment Report and Request for Beamtime.
