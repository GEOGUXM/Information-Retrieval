     __________________________________________________________________

   1. What is Washington's minimum wage?

   L&I enforces the state's minimum wage law.  The minimum wage is $6.72
   per hour through Dec. 31, 2001 and will rise to $6.90 on Jan. 1,
   2002.
     * More information about the minimum wage can be found here.
     * Frequently asked questions about wage and employment issues can be
       found here.

   2. Why do I have to pay for industrial insurance?

   The premium paid by both employers and workers helps pay for medical
   expenses and lost-time benefits for work-related injuries or illnesses.
   This system has been in effect in Washington since 1911. It provides
   prompt payment for expenses in contrast to having to go to court to
   determine who should pay for worker injuries.

   3. Who decides how much I have to pay for industrial insurance?

   What you pay is based on the accident and illness rates in your
   industry-specific type of job and for your particular company. Rates
   can vary widely, depending on how risky a job is. For instance,
   employers and workers in logging operations may pay several dollars per
   hour worked. But in less risky clerical and office employee jobs, the
   rate is just a few cents an hour. Rates for a particular logging
   operation or office setting could vary from those numbers, depending on
   the amount of workers' compensation claims filed by that company.

   4. What is the status of my workers' compensation claim (where is my
   time-loss check)?

   L&I handles nearly 200,000 workers' compensation claims a year. We get
   many calls on the status of particular claims. Each claim has a number
   and is assigned to a particular claims manager. You will be notified
   shortly after a claim is filed as to what your number is and how to
   contact your claims manager. L&I maintains a toll-free number for
   questions about claims (1-800-831-5227.)

   5. What does it mean that a contractor is registered by L&I?

   It means that the contractor has a business license and insurance and
   is bonded and has paid a registration fee to the department.

   7. How can I make sure my business/the place I work is meeting state
   safety and health standards?

   You can call our toll-free line, 1-800-423-7233. You also can contact
   one of our 22 offices around the state. We're listed in most phone
   books. The Thurston County office is at the Labor and Industries
   building at 7273 Linderson Way SW in Tumwater, (360) 902-5799. We
   provide technical assistance to businesses. We also investigate worker
   safety and health complaints.

   8. What is WISHA?

   WISHA is an acronym for a state law called the Washington Industrial
   Safety and Health Act. This law sets up a system for protecting worker
   health and safety. Safety standards are established for the wide
   variety of workplaces and occupations in our state. L&I provides
   technical assistance to businesses to foster a safe and healthful
   workplace environment. Compliance inspections also take place and
   employers can be penalized for violations of workplace safety and
   health standards. See our WISHA Services web for more information.

   9. What would be an allowable workers' compensation claim?

   The program is intended to pay costs for work-related injuries and
   health problems. This might include doctor, hospital and related costs
   necessary to the treatment and recovery of an injured worker. Employees
   are paid a percentage of their regular wages if they are unable to work
   for wages because of an industrial injury or illness. Injured employees
   who are unemployable as a result of their industrial injuries may
   qualify for vocational rehabilitation services. Partial disability
   payments, disability pensions and survivor benefits also may be paid.

   10. What can I do to reduce costs of workers' compensation?

   You can develop an active and effective safety program at your
   business. This could include:
     * Careful hiring policies to ensure the applicant is fit for the
       required job duties.
     * Employee safety training and use of proper equipment. This can
       identify potential hazards and how best to deal with them.
     * Clear workplace safety and health rules. This will minimize unsafe
       work practices.
     * Safety and health incentive programs to promote and reinforce
       on-the-job safety.
     * Monitor claims consistently be assigning someone to handle your
       employees' claims.
