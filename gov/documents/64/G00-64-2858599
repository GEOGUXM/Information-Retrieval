Format for Search Pattern

   The search string should be a list of words to search for, separated by
   the operators "|" and "&", where "|" stands for "or" and "&" stands for
   "and". Items can be grouped using parentheses. "|" has lower precedence
   than "&". The search is case insensitive.

  Examples

     * Search for a document that contains the word "electron":
       Search string = electron.
     * Search for a document that contains "io" and "torus":
       Search string = io & torus.
     * Search for a document that contains either "io" and "torus" or
       "ion" and "acoustic":
       Search string = io & torus | ion & acoustic.
