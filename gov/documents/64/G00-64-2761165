        designated disabled parking. No overnight parking or camping. The
        parking lot surface is large gravel that makes accessibility
        difficult. Westbrook Resort, which rents boats and cabins and also
        has a convenience store, is located next to the access site. A
        neighbor mentioned that swimmers will sometimes impede boaters
        wishing to launch or load. Swimmers in the area will also migrate
        over to nearby private property and "take over" a dock. The posted
        speed limit on Horseshoe Lake is 5 miles per hour. The vault toilet
        is a 'round' fiberglass unit.
