             Environmental Protection Indicators
             for California

   The California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA) has delegated
   responsibility to the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment
   (OEHHA) for developing environmental indicators, using an open,
   participatory process. These environmental indicators, as part of
   Cal/EPA's strategic planning process, will enable Cal/EPA to refine
   goals, efficiently allocate resources, and promote greater
   accountability in the State's environmental programs. Cal/EPA's
   environmental indicators will also provide information to the public
   regarding the state of California's environment..
