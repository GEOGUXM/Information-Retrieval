   Introduction

   The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has closely followed and
   reported on the transportation
   issues related to agricultural trade between the United States and
   China because efficient transportation is essential to improved trade
   between the two countries. As Hong Kong became a Special Administrative
   Region of China in mid-1997, this report reflects the ports status as
   one of Chinas own. But with Hong Kong receiving about 74 percent of
   U.S. containerized agricultural exports for the whole of China, the
   report in many cases separates out the Hong Kong traffic to better
   reveal the growing importance of more northern Chinese ports like
   Shanghai, Qingdao, Dalian, and Xingang. And because Chinas exports to
   the United States impact U.S. to China container rates and container
   availability, inbound trade volumes and rates are included in this
   report.

   From the perspective of the Chinese importer and the U.S. agricultural
   exporter, the ocean liner industry, composed of shipping lines like
   COSCO, Maersk-SeaLand, and Hanjin, is a vital link between U.S. farms
   and the Chinese consumer. Understanding which shipping firms are doing
   the majority of the business, how products move through Asia to China,
   at what level shipping firms price their services, and what can be done
   to lower shipping costs is essential to establishing long-term,
   profitable marketing operations. This report details how containers,
   the main mode of transporting high-valued and refrigerated agricultural
   products, move from the United States to China and how those services
   are priced.

   Major findings in this report are:

   ** From 1999 to 2000, the number of containers of agricultural products
   shipped from the United
   States to China, including Hong Kong, has increased by 9 percent.

   ** U.S. cotton exports dropped significantly from 1997 to 1999,
   reflecting a change in Chinese cotton
   production and import policies which affected all foreign imports.
   However, cotton exports rebounded in 2000 by 71 percent over the
   previous year.

   ** In northern Chinese ports, the volume of U.S. exports increased by
   34 percent with leather and
   hides, animal feed, cotton and grocery items showing strong increases
   over the previous year.

   ** In Hong Kong, although imports of U.S. products were up only
   slightly from 1999 to 2000,
   shipments of fresh oranges increased by 41 percent while nuts increased
   by 59 percent. Cotton rebounded into Hong Kong by 103 percent over the
   previous year.

   ** COSCO, the principal Chinese national shipping line, has maintained
   the greater share of traffic to
   northern Chinese ports. Competition among the many lines serving China
   remains strong.

   ** In 2000, 34 percent of containers were transshipped through other
   Asian ports (e.g., Pusan, Kobe,
   Yokohama, Kaohsiung) before arriving in northern Chinese ports.

   ** Since 1997, the majority (80 to 90 percent) of U.S. agricultural
   containers arrived in Hong Kong,
   with the remainder being shipped to other Chinese ports.

   ** Other ports of entry for U.S. agricultural products include
   Shanghai, Qingdao, Dalian, Xingang
   (Tianjin), Huangpu (Guangzhou), Shekou, and Fuzhou.

   ** Apple rates to Hong Kong are 6 percent lower today, at $3,257 per
   container, than they were 4
   years ago.

   ** Apple rates to Hong Kong do not differ dramatically from rates to
   Taiwan or Singapore. In June
   2001, container rates were only slightly lower into Taiwan (10 percent)
   and slightly higher into Singapore (11 percent).

   ** Rates for frozen beef shipments to other Asian port destinations
   were from 19 percent (Hong
   Kong) to 38 percent (Kaohsiung) lower than to Xingang port, near
   Tianjin, China.

   ** The Westbound Transpacific Stabilization Agreement, a "discussion
   group" of 12 Pacific Ocean
   shipping lines, announced that in 2000, it intended to increase
   shipping rates for refrigerated commodities like apples by about $1,200
   this year. Due to competition, rates have increased by less than $500.

   ** Chinas agricultural exports to the United States, including Hong
   Kong, totaled 80,788 TEUs in
   2000, about 43 percent of what was shipped from the United States to
   China. Over 85 percent of the products originated from ports other than
   Hong Kong.

   ** Nearly 19 percent of all U.S. imports were fish and fish products,
   while about 12 percent were
   grocery items. Rates were roughly comparable to Westbound rates for
   northern Chinese ports but much higher from Hong Kong to the United
   States.

   Major Agricultural Commodities in U.S.-to-China Container Trade: Tables
   1 and 2 list the top 10
   agricultural commodities shipped in containers from the United States
   to Chinese ports for calendar years 1999 and 2000. Hong Kong is
   included in a separate table to better highlight the growing importance
   of container terminals in the north. Total shipments of containerized
   agricultural commodities shipped to these Chinese ports, excluding Hong
   Kong, for 2000 was 44,141 TEUs, a standard measure used in ocean
   shipping. (See table 1.) This amount of imports from the United States
   increased 34 percent over the 1999 level but was still down from the
   1997 level of 60,330 TEUs.

   The decrease in the number of agricultural shipments overall was almost
   exclusively due to a drop in
   cotton shipments of more than 33,000 TEUs from 1997 to 2000. In 1997,
   Chinese agricultural policy makers began encouraging more domestic
   production and enforcing regulations which restricted foreign imports.
   Overall, Chinese cotton imports fell from 783,000 tons in 1997 to
   52,000 tons in 2000 [Annual Cotton Reports, Foreign Agricultural
   Service, Beijing].

   Top cotton suppliers, the United States, Australia, and Uzbekistan, all
   reported significant declines in exports to China. The United States,
   which had achieved a 50-percent share of the Chinese market, was most
   affected.

   *TEU = 20-foot equivalent container unit. Both 20-foot and 40-foot
   containers are regularly used in the U.S.-China
   trades. A 20-foot container generally weighs between 9 and 15 tons
   depending on the commodity. (Source: PIERS, Journal of Commerce, New
   York)

   Despite the overall decline in U.S. cotton exports to China from 1997
   levels, other product lines were
   able to achieve significant gains. From 1999 to 2000, leather and hides
   increased 46 percent, animal feed increased by 47 percent, and even
   cotton experienced a 29 percent rebound. Grocery items (which include
   foodstuffs, pastes, sauces, and soups) continued as a strong beginner
   in the trade with an 85 percent increase over the year before.
   Traditional imports, like frozen fish, frozen poultry, fishmeal, frozen
   potatoes, and dairy products, all maintained approximate levels with
   the year before.

   Imports of U.S. agricultural products into China through the port of
   Hong Kong present a significantly different picture than through other
   Chinese ports. Higher valued products, like frozen poultry, fresh
   fruit, citrus, fresh and frozen vegetables, grocery items, nuts and
   beef, replace lower valued commodities, like cotton, hides, and grain
   products. (See table 2.) Although imports of U.S. products were up only
   slightly from 1999 to 2000, shipments of fresh oranges increased by 41
   percent while nuts increased by 59 percent. Cotton rebounded into Hong
   Kong by 103 percent over the previous year. Frozen poultry, grocery
   items, and beef showed some decline but overall exports remained fairly
   stable.

   Major Shipping Lines in the U.S.-to-China Trades: A major advantage of
   the ocean container shipping market is the degree of competition that
   exists. Competition among shipping lines tends to drive down shipping
   rates and increase services. Policies of the Governments of China and
   the United States encourage the services of worldwide shipping lines to
   call at each nations ports, allowing shippers a wide range of shipping
   services and more frequent service. Table 3 lists the top 10 shipping
   lines serving the U.S.-China trade in 1999 and 2000, excluding Hong
   Kong.

   Because carriers sometimes specialize in services (refrigerated
   containers versus non-refrigerated or dry containers) or commodities
   (some carriers have contracts with major shippers of cotton, grain
   products, fruits, or other products), the ranking of top shipping lines
   is likely to change from year to year. COSCO, the principal Chinese
   national shipping line, has maintained the greater share of traffic for
   Chinese ports, excluding Hong Kong. Other carriers, like
   Maersk-SeaLand, Hanjin, American President Lines (APL), and Hyundai
   were all top shipping firms in 2000, with market shares differing only
   slightly from 1999. Even with the SeaLand merger with Maersk and APL
   merger with Neptune Orient Lines, the U.S.-to-China trade exhibits good
   competition among shipping firms carrying agricultural products. Most
   of these same carriers serve Hong Kong, and competition among carriers
   at that port is as good as or better than most northern ports, given
   the size of the Hong Kong market.

   On May 1, 1999, new U.S. regulations concerning all ocean shipping
   companies that call on U.S. ports
   took effect. Probably the most dramatic event relating to the
   regulations has been the demise of ocean shipping cartels, notably the
   Transpacific Westbound Rate Agreement which dominated pricing in the
   U.S.-to-Asia trades. Ocean carriers are still allowed to meet and
   discuss rate levels and capacity in the trades but the cartels are much
   less disciplined, and carriers do not necessarily have to maintain
   standard rate levels. These changes have largely been brought about by
   newer, more liberal confidential contracting arrangements, which are
   now possible between shippers and ocean carriers. Industry analysts
   believe that 80 to 90 percent of all container movements will
   eventually occur under contract. U.S. exporters and Chinese importers
   should explore establishing contractual shipping services with one or
   several carriers as a way of reducing rates or setting service
   standards. Shipper associations, whether for import or export, are
   being explored and formed to pool container volumes and enhance shipper
   bargaining power when negotiating with carriers.

   Major U.S.-to-China Shipping Routes: Tables 4 and 5 list the amount of
   direct versus transshipped containers and the major transhipment points
   from 1998 to 2000 into Chinese ports other than Hong Kong. Hong Kong
   has been excluded from the table to better reveal shipments into other
   Chinese ports which are of growing importance. In 2000, 34 percent of
   containers shipped primarily from U.S. West Coast ports had to be
   transshipped through other Asian ports before arrival. Shallow port
   depth, inadequate container handling equipment, and the lack of
   sufficient China-bound cargos per ship are the primary reasons ocean
   liner companies prefer to transfer containers onto smaller vessels from
   the larger (4,000 to 6,000 TEU) vessels which regularly leave the
   United States. The trend to ship through foreign ports has remained
   relatively steady since 1998. Pusan, Kobe, Yokohama, and Kaohsiung are
   in a good geographic position to benefit from the increasing trade
   between the United States and northern Chinese cities. Port market
   shares for these transshipment cargos vary from year to year given the
   particular shipping lines which are moving the containers and the
   efficiency and cost of transshipping through any particular port.

   Major Chinese Ports of Entry: Since 1998, the majority (about 80 to 90
   percent) of U.S. agricultural cargoes first arrived in Hong Kong, with
   the remainder being shipped to other Chinese ports (table 6). Despite
   the growing efficiency of other Chinese container ports, Hong Kong has
   increased its share of cargos landed in China from 82 percent in 1998
   to 91 percent in 2000. Hong Kong (along with Singapore) handles nearly
   15 million containers (TEUs) of all commodities per year, almost three
   times as much as their closest competitors, Kaohsiung, Rotterdam, and
   Pusan. Shanghai ranks around 10th in the world for number of containers
   handled at approximately 3 million TEUs per year.

   Other ports of entry for U.S. agricultural products include Shanghai,
   Qingdao, Dalian, Xingang (Tianjin), Huangpu (Guangzhou), Shekou, and
   Fuzhou. Market shares among these ports have varied only slightly over
   the last 3 years with the exception of Shanghai which significantly
   increased its market share over the last year. All ports are looking to
   increase their container handling capacity, with Shanghai, Xingang, and
   Dalian planning extensive investments in new terminal capacity through
   joint ventures [Drewry Shipping Consultants, 1999].

   The Cost of Exporting to China: As mentioned previously, Hong Kongs
   large container throughput, mainly as a transshipment center for
   Southeast Asia and other Chinese ports, translates directly into cost
   savings for products shipped into Hong Kong and its environs. In table
   8, the rates charged by ocean carriers serving selected Asian ports are
   compared for apples.

   In the case of apple shipments from Seattle, WA, to Hong Kong, rates to
   Hong Kong do not differ significantly from rates to Taiwan or
   Singapore. In June 2001, the rates to Hong Kong ($3,257) were higher
   than into Taiwan (by 10 percent) and lower than into Singapore (by 11
   percent). Because some of the ports differ considerably in distance
   from the United States, the rates to these ports were divided by
   statute mile distances to compute a "cost-per-mile" figure for a
   representative container of apples. Discounting distance in this way,
   the cost was $0.58 per mile to Hong Kong and $0.55 per mile into
   Taiwan. It should be emphasized that using a cost-per-mile figure has
   its limitations because a vessel may stop at one or more ports before
   it arrives at a particular port or containers may be transshipped from
   another country.

   Apple rates to Hong Kong are lower today than they were 4 years ago by
   only about 6 percent.  Since September 1997, apple rates have dropped
   from a high of $3,475 to a low of $2,634 in May of 1998. Over the past
   3 years, apple rates to Hong Kong have risen significantly to $3,257 in
   June 2001. The Westbound Transpacific Stabilization Agreement, a
   "discussion group" of 12 Pacific Ocean shipping lines, announced
   publicly on May 16, 2000, that they intended to increase refrigerated
   shipping rates for commodities like apples by about $1,200 in 2001.
   Although many carriers sought such an increase, the net effect was less
   than $500 per container because of competition from other carriers.

   Table 9 compares the rates for frozen beef shipments to Xingang port,
   near Tianjin, China, versus other Asian port destinations. Rates to
   other destinations were from 19 percent (Hong Kong) to 38 percent
   (Kaohsiung) lower than to Xingang. Beef rates to Xingang in June 2001
   were about $800 more per container than a year ago.

   The necessity to transship Xiagang containers through these other major
   ports or other transshipment ports increases the cost per container
   into Xiagang. Currently, this may be the cheapest way of providing
   service to the port. As traffic volumes increase and the ports
   container terminals increase their capacity to handle larger ships on
   mainline routes, rates will eventually decrease in comparison to these
   larger container hubs.

   China to U.S. Agricultural Shipping: Chinas agricultural exports to the
   United States, including Hong
   Kong, totaled 80,788 TEUs in 2000, about 43 percent of what was shipped
   from the United States to China. Over 85 percent of the products
   originated from Chinese ports other than Hong Kong. Nearly 19 percent
   of all U.S. imports were fish and fish products, while about 12 percent
   were grocery items (e.g., foodstuffs, pastes, sauces, and soups). Other
   products include herbs, spices, canned vegetables, canned fruit, and
   other higher-valued or processed products.

   Frozen seafood rates from Qingdao to Southern California ports were
   $5,308 per container on average in August 2001. This is comparable to
   the $5,246 beef rate from Southern California to the nearby Chinese
   port of Xingang. Frozen seafood rates from Hong Kong to Southern
   California were considerably more at $7,514 per container. Apple rates,
   quoted previously, from Washington State to Hong Kong were 56 percent
   less at $3,257 per refrigerated container.

   Selecting an Ocean Carrier: Although international traders are
   optimistic that the economic and political climate is right for
   northern Chinese port investment, importers and exporters must continue
   to deal with relatively higher ocean freight rates relative to other
   Asian ports in the region. Selecting an ocean carrier with the lowest
   cost that delivers superior services is no easy task. Carriers are
   continuously changing the rates they charge and their shipping
   schedules to take advantage of shifting trade volumes and opportunities
   for increased profits. U.S. exporters who are selling the product at a
   delivered price are faced with which shipping line to select. Many
   times, however, Asian importers are quoted agricultural commodity
   prices based on which carrier they select, so it is important for the
   importer to have knowledge of carrier performance and cost. Table 10 is
   representative of monthly reports, called the Ocean Freight Rate
   Bulletin, published by USDA to better inform importers and exporters
   about ocean services and rates for specific commodities between
   specific destinations.

   Each Bulletin lists all ocean carriers (e.g., COSCO, Maersk-SeaLand,
   APL) participating in a particular trade (e.g., Seattle/Takoma ports to
   Hong Kong) for a particular commodity and the market share for the
   shipping line. Each bulletin lists the number of TEUs that were shipped
   the previous month along with the total shipped so far for the year.
   Transit times between the United States and the destination ports are
   also listed for each carrier. The ocean rate is then calculated based
   on a per-container rate along with ancillary charges like Bunker (fuel)
   Adjustment Factors, Container Yard Receiving charges, Currency
   Adjustment Factors, and any other charges that apply.

   With this information, a shipper can see which carriers are in a
   particular market, how much of the
   market they command, approximately how long the product will be in
   transit, and what prices ocean carriers charge. Ocean Freight Rate
   Bulletins are currently produced for apples, almonds, beef, cherries,
   cotton, frozen potatoes, grapes, grapefruit, lemons, lettuce, oranges,
   pears, pistachios, poultry, and raisins. Bulletins are only produced
   during major shipping periods for fresh fruits and other products.
   Also, there must be sufficient activity in a particular trade to
   warrant the production of a Bulletin.

   Bulletins are available by mail from USDA or on the Internet at
   http://www.ams.usda. gov/tmd/Ocean/Index.htm. Another useful
   publication posted on the Internet is the Directory of Freight
   Forwarders Serving Agricultural Shippers (1999). The directory has
   recently been formatted to work as an interactive database that will
   allow the user to search for freight forwarders who handle agricultural
   products by the commodity they generally handle and region of the world
   they generally serve. The vast majority of U.S. exporters use freight
   forwarders as do many importers. This publication and many others that
   may prove useful to U.S. exporters to China and Chinese importers may
   be found at http://www.ams.usda.gov/tmd/tmdsea.htm.
