                                             * When leaving Dulles Airport take the exit for the Greenway Toll
       Road (267) to Leesburg, VA. This will be one of the first available
       exits. Take the toll road ($2.00) until it ends at Route 7. Exit
       from the left lane and take Route 7 west toward Winchester.

       Hillsboro and Charles Town. Continue through Hillsboro, over the
       Blue Ridge Mountains and the Shenandoah River.

     * Do NOT take the bypass around Charles Town, but continue directly
       through town, and around the traffic circle in adjoining Ranson,
       still following Route 9 towards Martinsburg.

     * About 1.5 miles west of the railroad tracks, turn left on the
       Leetown Pike (brown sign for the "National Fisheries Center"; and
       just before Buick agency on the right).

     * At deadend, turn right to Leetown Science Center, parking lot is on
       the left.
