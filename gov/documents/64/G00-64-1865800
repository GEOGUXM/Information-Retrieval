                        Space Team Online Description

   Join the men and women who make the space shuttle fly and learn about
   their diverse and exciting careers. We'll peek behind the scenes as
   these folks train astronauts, prepare the shuttle between missions and
   then launch it, manage the mission from Mission Control and then bring
   the shuttle home with a safe landing. Also, we'll meet the people who
   are making the International Space Station a reality.

   Curriculum supplements about flying rockets and microgravity
   experiments are available to help teachers incorporate the lessons of
   the shuttle into their classrooms.

   We hope that this will prove to be an exciting learning resource for
   you and your students. We think it will be a great ride. So prepare
   yourself for blastoff.
