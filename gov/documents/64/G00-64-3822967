   Battelle Chlorinated Solvent Bioremediation Design Service for In Situ
   Bioremediation and Natural Attenuation

   Battelle Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle Northwest) has been
   developing and applying in situ bioremediation of chlorinated solvents
   and reactive transport software for the last decade.  Key contributions
   include development of the RT3D numerical code and successful
   applications of both accelerated in situ bioremediation (ISB) and
   monitored natural attenuation (MNA).  Battelle Northwest has conducted
   numerous projects for both federal government and private clients
   demonstrating strong capabilities in accelerated in situ bioremediation
   design and natural attenuation evaluation.
   Services That Battelle Northwest Provides
     * Laboratory Microcosms
        Battelle Northwest has extensive experience evaluating a variety
            of microbial metabolisms for reductive and co-metabolic
            dechlorination through use of laboratory microcosms studies.
            Battelle Northwest structures these studies within a context
            of reactive transport analysis to specifically obtain the
            information important to design an accelerated ISB system or
            evaluate natural attenuation.
     * Customized Reaction Modules for RT3D
        Battelle Northwest can efficiently develop customized reaction
            expressions within the RT3D reaction module framework to
            describe reactions at the level of detail needed for specific
            sites.  For instance, coupled reactions for substrate use and
            subsequent dechlorination can be used to describe reductive
            dechlorination induced by lactate amendment or methanotrophic
            co-metabolic dechlorination.  Standard first-order
            representation of dechlorination for evaluation of natural
            attenuation can be improved to include non-sequential
            dechlorination pathways, inhibition terms, and electron
            acceptor dependencies for the reactions.  Customized reaction
            modules provide a technical basis for reactive transport
            simulations that supports better designs for accelerated ISB
            and better defensibility with regulatory authorities for
            evaluations of MNA.  Battelle Northwest has a variety of
            technical resources and can develop custom reaction modules
            for RT3D for applications other than chlorinated solvent
            bioremediation.  For instance, descriptions of biological or
            chemical (e.g., oxidation) reactions for other organic
            contaminants or inorganic contaminants can be included in
            custom reaction modules.
     * Customizations of RT3D
        In some cases, modifying the RT3D code may help in conducting
            simulations for your site.  For example, in one recent
            project, Battelle Northwest modified RT3D to accommodate
            cyclic flow conditions induced by seasonal variations in river
            stage at one of the boundaries for the simulation.  Instead of
            entering boundary conditions for 120 time points to describe
            this variation over the 30-year simulation, only 4 time points
            were input.  Additional features can also be added to RT3D.
            An example is the ability to calculate injection well
            concentrations during recirculation between an extraction and
            injection well pair.
     * Accelerated ISB Design
        Battelle Northwest has significant experience in designing
            accelerated in situ bioremediation systems.  Battelle
            Northwest personnel have performed all system design aspects,
            including well network design, nutrient amendment strategy,
            equipment specification, and system installation and
            operation.
     * Natural Attenuation Evaluation
        Battelle Northwest provides technical support for evaluation of
            natural attenuation and development of long-term monitoring
            plans associated with implementation of MNA.  For sites
            requiring significant fate and transport analysis, Battelle
            Northwest can provide technical support for RT3D-based
            modelling.  Battelle Northwest also has significant resources
            for addressing site-specific technical issues such as
            including the evaluation of DNAPL source areas (e.g.,
            multi-phase transport assessment and estimates of source flux)
            with the evaluation of MNA for the dispersed plume.  MNA
            evaluations require a thorough description of relevant
            attenuation mechanisms and development of lines of evidence
            for how these attenuation mechanisms are occurring at the
            site.  Battelle Northwest can provide the technical
            information needed for these descriptions and serves as a
            respected technical expert when communicating these lines of
            evidence to regulatory authorities.
     * Remediation Alternative Evaluation
        Battelle Northwest can efficiently evaluate the viability of
            accelerated ISB or natural attenuation options through
            application of RT3D-based reactive transport assessment.
            Battelle Northwest has performed this type of remediation
            alternative evaluation for sites at Hanford, Point Mugu, and
            INEEL.  Battelle Northwest has ready access to experts on
            non-bioremediation technologies as well if the client is
            interested in a broader assessment of potential remediation
            alternatives.

   Working with Battelle Northwest

   For typical arrangements, Battelle Northwest is a subcontractor to the
   prime contractor for remediation work and provides technical input in
   the areas mentioned above.  Under some conditions, Battelle Northwest
   can also serve as the prime contractor.  A relationship with Battelle
   Northwest can be initiated at any point in a project, however, bringing
   in Battelle as part of a team to co-author proposals should be
   considered as an effective and mutually beneficial starting point.
