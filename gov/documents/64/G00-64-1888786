   Diversions

   So what is a SHEIK anyway?

SHEIKS : Diversions
     __________________________________________________________________

   Now let's be honest for a moment. We are all only human. We all suffer
   human frailties. We all know that man cannot live on work alone. As
   such, it sometimes becomes necessary for us to shed the bonds which
   have tied us to our chosen endeavor and set forth into the world in
   search of life-replenishing sustenance. For years these primal urges
   have been satisfied almost exclusively by the only institution capable
   of meeting such a tall order:

                 The In-N-Out Burger of Pinole, California.

                        The SHEIKS at In-N-Out Burger

   Here we see some of our younger members posing for a picture in front
   of this hallowed building after having lavished the savory goodness of
   two Double Meats with only tomatoes and spread. Notice the pleasant
   smiles and the firm grip on the palm-tree-covered soda cups. As long as
   In-N-Out Burger continues its proud tradition of hamburger excellence
   we will be there consume its astounding product.

   Visit In-N-Out Burger on the web at www.In-N-Out.com or learn some of
   the secret In-N-Out lingo.

   Our hunger satiated we sometimes succumb to the temptation of an
   electronic palace mere minutes away:

                     The Best Buy of Pinole, California.

                           The SHEIKS at Best Buy

   The collection of CDs, flat-screen TVs, and home theatre systems is too
   enticing not to give an occasional look. Here we see the proud owner of
   a new CD displaying his purchase for all the world to see.
