      A Message from Ron Dick, Director of the National Infrastructure
                    Protection Center Picture of Ron Dick

   I would like to welcome you to the web site of the National
   Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC). Located in the FBI's
   headquarters building in Washington, D.C., the NIPC brings together
   representatives from U.S. government agencies, state and local
   governments, and the private sector in a partnership to protect our
   nation's critical infrastructures.

   Established in February 1998, the NIPC's mission is to serve as the
   U.S. government's focal point for threat assessment, warning,
   investigation, and response for threats or attacks against our critical
   infrastructures. These infrastructures, which include
   telecommunications, energy, banking and finance, water systems,
   government operations, and emergency services, are the foundation upon
   which our industrialized society is based.

   Our society is increasingly relying on new information technologies and
   the Internet to conduct business, manage industrial activities, engage
   in personal communications, and perform scientific research. While
   these technologies allow for enormous gains in efficiency,
   productivity, and communications, they also create new vulnerabilities
   to those who would do us harm. The same interconnectivity that allows
   us to transmit information around the globe at the click of a mouse or
   push of a button also creates unprecedented opportunities for
   criminals, terrorists, and hostile foreign nation-states who might seek
   to steal money or proprietary data, invade private records, conduct
   industrial espionage, cause a vital infrastructure to cease operations,
   or engage in Information Warfare.

   Protecting our critical infrastructures in the Information Age raises
   new challenges for all of us. Above all, it requires a partnership
   between the government and private industry to reduce our vulnerability
   to attack and increase our capabilities to respond to new threats. The
   NIPC provides an important vehicle for carrying that partnership
   forward.
