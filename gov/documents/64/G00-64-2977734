    1. We believe that to be successful and to be of value this site must
       be developed, maintained and supported by Federal employees and for
       Federal employees. We want this to be YOUR web site and to make
       this a better resource for fellow Feds. We encourage maximum
       feedback from the Federal employee community. And we intend to use
       that feedback to make continuous improvements. Please advise us
       what works for you and what doesn't. We want to encourage
       participation by offering as many opportunities to contribute your
       ideas and experiences as possible.
    2. This web site is located on a governmental site operated by the
       Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration. There
       are innumerable resources on the Internet provided by commercial
       vendors interested in selling their products and services. The
       authors are grateful to these vendors for the value derived from
       the presence of many of these resources on the site. However, since
       this is a Federal site, it would be inappropriate for this web site
       to endorse specific products and services. Needless to say, we have
       not and will not accept any payments to list or endorse any such
       products and services.
