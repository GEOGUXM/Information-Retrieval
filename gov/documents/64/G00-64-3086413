                 Abortion pill studied as oral contraceptive

   NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters Health) - The results of a small study of
   women in the UK and China suggest that the abortion pill mifepristone
   could be developed into an estrogen-free oral contraceptive.

   Researchers found that in low daily doses, mifepristone--also known as
   RU-486--suppressed ovulation in a majority of the women they studied.
   And no pregnancies occurred during the 4-month study period, according
   to findings published in the January issue of the Journal of Clinical
   Endocrinology and Metabolism.

   When used with another drug called misoprostol, mifepristone can induce
   an abortion if taken within 7 weeks of a woman's last menstrual period.
   Mifepristone works by blocking the effects of the female hormone
   progesterone.

   It is this anti-progesterone activity that makes the drug potentially
   useful in birth control, according to the new study's authors, led by
   Dr. David T. Baird of the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.

   They studied 50 women in Edinburgh and 40 in Shanghai, all of whom
   received either 5- or 2-milligram doses of mifepristone each day for
   about 4 months.

   Overall, the drug prevented a majority of ovulations, but was more
   effective among the Chinese women. Among UK women, 38% of those on the
   lower dose ovulated once during treatment. On the higher dose, 19%
   ovulated once. Among the Shanghai women, there were only three
   instances of ovulation, according to the report.

   In addition, treatment halted monthly periods in a majority of
   women--although this was more common among those in China--and two in
   the UK experienced extended bleeding. Within a month of going off
   mifepristone, all women resumed ovulation, Baird's team reports.

   The researchers suggest that the greater ovulation suppression in
   Chinese women may have to do with their diet and lower body mass.

   Although there were no pregnancies during the study, Baird's team
   points out that these preliminary findings do not indicate how
   effective mifepristone might be as a contraceptive. Moreover, they
   note, more research is needed see whether daily doses of mifepristone
   might pose a health hazard to the endometrium--the lining of the
   uterus.

   There is some concern, the authors explain, that progesterone-blocking
   agents might cause abnormal overgrowth of the endometrium or even
   promote cancer, as such drugs would allow the tissue to be continuously
   exposed to estrogen levels that are unbalanced by progesterone.

   However, the researchers note, there were no signs of endometrial
   enlargement in this short-term study.

   "We conclude that mifepristone in low daily doses inhibits
   ovulation...and has the potential to be developed as a novel
   estrogen-free oral contraceptive pill," Baird and colleagues write.
