   [line.gif] 2002 Summer Seminars and Institutes for School Teachers

   Each year the NEH offers teachers opportunities to study humanities
   topics in a variety of Summer Seminars and Institutes. The dates and
   duration of each project are listed under each title. The application
   deadline is March 1, 2002.

   Amount of Award
   All teachers selected to participate in a seminar or institute will be
   awarded a stipend of $2,800, $3,250, or $3,700 (depending on the length
   of the seminar or institute) to cover travel costs, books and other
   research expenses, and living expenses. Additionally all participants
   who teach in New Jersey will be awarded an additional travel stipend
   (from $250 to $1,000, depending on the location of the seminar or
   institute) by the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation of Morristown, New
   Jersey.

   Eligibility
   Full-time teachers in American K-12 schools, whether public, private,
   or church-affiliated, are eligible to apply to seminars and institutes.
   Americans teaching abroad are also eligible if a majority of the
   students they teach are American citizens. Librarians and school
   administrators may also be eligible. Applicants should consult the
   guidelines and application information received directly from seminar
   and institute directors concerning any additional eligibility
   requirements specific to the project. Selection committees are directed
   to give first consideration to applicants who have not participated in
   an NEH-supported seminar or institute in the last three years.

   How to Apply
   Please send or e-mail a request for application information and
   expanded project descriptions to the seminar and institute directors
   listed here. When doing so, please include your regular mailing address
   since directors may send application material through the mail. You may
   request information about as many projects as you like, but you may
   apply to no more than one project. The application deadline is March 1,
   2002 (postmark).

   Information
   Please direct all questions concerning individual seminars and
   institutes as well as all requests for application materials to the
   appropriate director. General questions concerning the National
   Endowment for the Humanities' Seminars and Institutes Program may be
   directed to 202/606-8463 or e-mail: sem-inst@neh.gov.

   Seminars

   A seminar for school teachers enables fifteen participants to explore a
   topic or set of readings with a scholar having special interest and
   expertise in the field. The core material of the seminar need not
   relate directly to the school curriculum; the principal goal of the
   seminar is to engage teachers in the scholarly enterprise and to expand
   and deepen their understanding of the humanities through reading,
   discussion, writing, and reflection.

   Institutes

   An institute for school teachers, typically led by a team of core
   faculty and visiting scholars, is designed to present the best
   available scholarship on important humanities issues and works taught
   in the nation's schools. The 25 to 35 participating teachers compare
   and synthesize the various perspectives offered by the faculty, make
   connections between the institute content and classroom applications,
   and often develop improved teaching materials for their classrooms.
