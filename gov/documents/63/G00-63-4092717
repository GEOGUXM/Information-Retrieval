     STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT REGARDING THE UNITED STATES' DECISION TO
      STOP DEGRADING GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM ACCURACY THE WHITE HOUSE
                        Office of the Press Secretary
           _______________________________________________________
                                For Immediate
                             Release May 1, 2000
     STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT REGARDING THE UNITED STATES' DECISION TO
              STOP DEGRADING GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM ACCURACY

   Today, I am pleased to announce that the United States will stop the
   intentional degradation of the Global Positioning System (GPS) signals
   available to the public beginning at midnight tonight. We call this
   degradation feature Selective Availability (SA). This will mean that
   civilian users of GPS will be able to pinpoint locations up to ten
   times more accurately than they do now. GPS is a dual-use,
   satellite-based system that provides accurate location and timing data
   to users worldwide. My March 1996 Presidential Decision Directive
   included in the goals for GPS to: ?encourage acceptance and integration
   of GPS into peaceful civil, commercial and scientific applications
   worldwide; and to encourage private sector investment in and use of
   U.S. GPS technologies and services.? To meet these goals, I committed
   the U.S. to discontinuing the use of SA by 2006 with an annual
   assessment of its continued use beginning this year.
   The decision to discontinue SA is the latest measure in an on-going
   effort to make GPS more responsive to civil and commercial users
   worldwide. Last year, Vice President Gore announced our plans to
   modernize GPS by adding two new civilian signals to enhance the civil
   and commercial service. This initiative is on-track and the budget
   further advances modernization by incorporating some of the new
   features on up to 18 additional satellites that are already awaiting
   launch or are in production. We will continue to provide all of these
   capabilities to worldwide users free of charge.
   My decision to discontinue SA was based upon a recommendation by the
   Secretary of Defense in coordination with the Departments of State,
   Transportation, Commerce, the Director of Central Intelligence, and
   other Executive Branch Departments and Agencies. They realized that
   worldwide transportation safety, scientific, and commercial interests
   could best be served by discontinuation of SA. Along with our
   commitment to enhance GPS for peaceful applications, my administration
   is committed to preserving fully the military utility of GPS. The
   decision to discontinue SA is coupled with our continuing efforts to
   upgrade the military utility of our systems that use GPS, and is
   supported by threat assessments which conclude that setting SA to zero
   at this time would have minimal impact on national security.
   Additionally, we have demonstrated the capability to selectively deny
   GPS signals on a regional basis when our national security is
   threatened. This regional approach to denying navigation services is
   consistent with the 1996 plan to discontinue the degradation of civil
   and commercial GPS service globally through the SA technique.
   Originally developed by the Department of Defense as a military system,
   GPS has become a global utility. It benefits users around the world in
   many different applications, including air, road, marine, and rail
   navigation, telecommunications, emergency response, oil exploration,
   mining, and many more. Civilian users will realize a dramatic
   improvement in GPS accuracy with the discontinuation of SA. For
   example, emergency teams responding to a cry for help can now determine
   what side of the highway they must respond to, thereby saving precious
   minutes. This increase in accuracy will allow new GPS applications to
   emerge and continue to enhance the lives of people around the world.
