                     Life Event & Affinity Design (LEAD)

   Governor Gray Davis has directed state government to improve
   effectiveness and provide better service by utilizing technology.
   Generally called "eGovernment," this effort includes a number of
   technology initiatives that are proposed or underway.

   Rather than take a scattershot approach, the Governor's Office for
   Innovation in Government helped guide a coordinated effort by using
   innovative techniques that ensured the customer was at the forefront of
   all decisions.

   The centerpiece of this initiative was the groundbreaking Life Event
   and Affinity Design (LEAD) workshops held around the state. Sponsored
   by the Governor's Office for Innovation in Government, the primary goal
   of the LEAD workshops was to leverage the best technology and to break
   down bureaucratic barriers to customer service.

   A design team of private sector and state and local government
   representatives worked to define the LEAD workshop objectives. Invited
   to attend were a cross-section of citizens, service providers,
   students, technologists and others with an interest in improving
   government services. They were asked to identify "life events," where
   citizens interface with government, and then they considered current
   and possible future services associated with the event. A number of
   innovative tools were used to help customers visualize and articulate
   what effortless access to government services would be like. Workshop
   organizes helped attendees identify "affinities," or relationships of
   events that Californians typically experience.

   The ideas that grew out of the LEAD workshops were refined and
   reported, and have influenced the design of the California "portal"
   website and various other eGovernment initiatives.
