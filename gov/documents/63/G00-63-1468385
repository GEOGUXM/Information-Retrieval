   The Space Station Fluids & Combustion Facility (FCF) is a modular,
   multi-user facility to accommodate microgravity science experiments on
   board the US Laboratory Module of the International Space Station. The
   FCF shall be a permanent facility aboard the ISS, and will be capable
   of accommodating up to ten science investigations per year. It shall
   support the NASA Science and Technology Research Plans for the
   International Space Station which requires sustained systematic
   research of the effects of reduced gravity in the areas of fluid
   physics and combustion science. The FCF is being developed by the
   Microgravity Science Division (MSD) at the NASA Glenn Research Center.
