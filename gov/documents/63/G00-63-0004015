                                    Hints

    Problem  Possible Solutions
   The search found nothing when searching for a keyword.

   Try an alternate spelling of the word.

   Try turning SUBSTRING MATCHING on and searching for part of the word.
   The search found nothing for several keywords.

   Try separating the words with or or a combination of and and or.

   Try eliminating a keyword and submitting the search again.

                            Other things to check

   Do not include hyphens or quotation marks in the query box.
   Eg: A search for a "CAMAC crate controller" should be entered as this:

   CAMAC crate controller

   Not this:

   "CAMAC crate controller"

                                    Notes

    1. Search Engine Response to Keywords:
       The search engine is not case-sensitive. That is, it will convert
       any text in upper-case to lower-case. For example, a search for the
       word "CAMAC" or "Camac" will actually result in a search for the
       word "camac." Since the search library does not index uppercase
       words or characters (see 3 below), this does not restrict the
       results of the search.
       Also, keywords not seperated by "and" or "or" will automatically be
       searched for using the "and" parameter. That is, the search will
       look for documents with all of the specified keywords. For example,
       the search "octal discriminator" will actually search for "octal
       and discriminator."
    2. Search Engine Response to Special Characters
       The search engine is set to ignore any special characters such as
       quotation marks and hyphens. Do not use a hypen in a query. Enter
       any keywords normally hyphenated without the hyphen(s). For
       instance, to search for "linear fan-out" you would enter "linear
       fan out" in the query field.
    3. Search Engine Index
       The search engine works by searching through an index of keywords
       from the specification pages in the Prep Catalog. The indexer
       stores a given word (in lower case only) and the number of times it
       occurs in a specific Web page. The Prep Catalog indexer has been
       set to only index the FIRST page of all documents in the Prep
       Catalog.
    4. Query responses
       When the Equipment Catalog Search returns a query, the set of
       information presented to the browser should be as follows:
          + The preferences that were set by the user for the search.
          + The name of the document/module as a hypertext link.
          + The path to that specific file.
          + For each keyword:
               o The keyword (or variations) as it appears in the index
                 (in quotation marks)
               o The number of times that word appears in the document
               o The keyword as the user typed it (in parentheses)
