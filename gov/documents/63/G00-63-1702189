          Use the form below to search for documents in this web containing
          specific words or combinations of words. The text search engine will
          display a weighted list of matching documents, with better matches
          shown first. Each list item is a link to a matching document; if the
          document has a title it will be shown, otherwise only the document's
          file name is displayed. A brief explanation of the query language is
          available, along with examples.

          information and retrieval
                 finds documents containing both 'information' and 'retrieval'

          information not retrieval
                 finds documents containing 'information' but not 'retrieval'

          (information not retrieval) and WAIS
                 finds documents containing 'WAIS', plus 'information' but not
