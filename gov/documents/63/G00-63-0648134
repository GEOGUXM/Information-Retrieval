   Background Check Requirement

   All community care license applicants, employees, adults who reside in
   the facility and other specific individuals, identified by statute and
   licensing regulations, must submit fingerprints to the Department of
   Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the purpose of
   conduct a criminal background search.

   Live Scan Method of Submitting Fingerprints

   This is the method recommended by the Community Care Licensing
   Division.

   Live Scan is an electronic method of submitting fingerprints. This
   technology electronically transfers images of fingerprints and personal
   information to the Department of Justice (DOJ) in a matter of seconds,
   compared to the days currently required to send fingerprint cards
   through the U.S. mail. The results of the DOJ fingerprint check are
   sent to Community Care Licensing (CCL).

   CDSS, in partnership with Sylvan/Identix Fingerprinting Centers, offers
   Live Scan fingerprinting services by appointment at each Community Care
   Licensing Regional Office and other convenient locations throughout
   California.  There will be a Live Scan transmission cost of $16
   (effective 7/1/00) for certain applicants, which may be less than other
   commercially available fingerprinting services.  This fee is separate
   from the mandatory Department of Justice (DOJ) fees for all
   applicants.  Your local regional office can answer your questions on
   fingerprinting requirements.

   Please read the following steps to help you understand the Live Scan
   Fingerprint process.

     * The individual fills out the form and calls the Live Scan vendor at
       1-800-315-4507 to schedule an appointment. At that time, the
       appointment scheduler will ask you to provide the information on
       the Applicant Submission form. You will then be given an
       appointment time at a district office. (Note: It is very important
       that if you can not keep this appointment, that you call to cancel
       within 24 hours of your scheduled appointment.)
     * When you go to the regional office, the Live Scan operator will
       already have your information in the computer. You will then have
       your fingerprints scanned by the operator.
     * The Live Scan operator will then inform you of the charges, which
       include all necessary services DOJ, CACI, and FBI (CACI if
       applicable only) and the transmission of prints.
     * After recording the fingerprints and personal information, the data
       will be electronically transmitted to DOJ for processing.
     * DOJ will send the results of the fingerprint check to CCL.

   you are interested in setting up a billing account you may do so by
   calling the above (800) phone number.

   Card Method of Submitting Fingerprints:

   Another method of submitting fingerprints is by using a fingerprint
   card. If you choose to use the card method, you must submit one
   complete FD 258 (CCL) fingerprint card for each person. The card will
   be used for both a California and an FBI criminal background check. The
   card must be sent directly to the Department of Justice. If you are an
   applicant, do not send the card until you have received a letter from
   the Department telling you that your application has been accepted and
   have been assigned a facility number. Be sure to include the
   appropriate processing fee (see link below). Do not fold or staple the
   card.

   You may order fingerprint cards through the CDSS Warehouse. You may

   specific facility type below. Fax or mail your request to the CDSS
   Warehouse, P.O. Box 980788, West Sacramento, CA 95798. The fax number
