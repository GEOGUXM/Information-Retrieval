   space With at least 28 moons and several rings circling it, Jupiter is
   the largest planet in our solar system. This giant planet is surrounded
   by an enormous magnetic field called the magnetosphere, which has a
   million times the volume of Earth's magnetosphere. Its immense, complex
   atmosphere includes the Great Red Spot, a 300-year-old storm that is
   almost the size of three Earths.

   NASA's Galileo spacecraft has been orbiting Jupiter since December
   1995, providing a stream of discoveries about the planet, its four
   largest moons and the surrounding environment. The moon Europa shows
   evidence of a deep ocean of melted water under an icy crust. Closer to
   Jupiter, the moon Io is continuously resurfacing itself with fresh
   volcanic eruptions. Io's internal heat comes from tidal flexing due to
   Jupiter's gravitational pull. Galileo also dropped a probe into
   Jupiter's atmosphere to make the first in-place studies of the planet's
   clouds and winds. Galileo was preceded by NASA's Pioneer and Voyager
   spacecraft, which flew past Jupiter in the 1970s. A mission now in
   development, Europa Orbiter, is designed to follow up on the Galileo
   mission's discoveries about that world as a potential life-supporting
   habitat.
