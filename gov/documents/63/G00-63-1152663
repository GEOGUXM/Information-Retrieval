   Science And Math Initiatives and The Teacher Help Service

   Originally a project of the Boulder Valley School District, Boulder,
   Colorado, funded by the Annenberg/CPB and the US West Foundation, and
   supported by the Los Alamos National Laboratory

   Creating Connections was a rural math and science initiative funded by
   the Annenberg/CPB and by the US West Foundation. The ultimate goal of
   the project was to improve math and science education in rural
   settings. The project consisted of three components. The first
   component involved training rural math and science teachers on the use
   of Internet at 20 regional sites in the United States. Each site hosted
   approximately 26 rural math and science teachers for a two day workshop
   during the summer of 1994.

   The second component to the project consisted of building a data base
   called SAMI (Science And Math Initiatives). SAMI is a clearing house of
   resources, funding, and curriculum for rural math and science teachers.

   The third component was a two year online support piece for the
   original workshop participants. Support was provided through e-mail, an
   800 phone line, and a newsletter. This two year piece also included an
   online course to further enhance the participants knowledge of
   Internet.

   [p_about1.gif] Funding for SAMI was provided by Annenberg/CPB. Support
   for continuation of SAMI is provided by Los Alamos National Laboratory.
   SAMI is under constant development and will be updated on a daily basis
   on the Los Alamos National Laboratory's SAMI server.
