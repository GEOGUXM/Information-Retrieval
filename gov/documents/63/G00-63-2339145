   The USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory strives to serve the national
   interest by helping people to live knowledgeably and safely with
   volcanoes and related natural hazards including earthquakes,
   landslides, and debris flows in the western United States and elsewhere
   in the world. CVO assesses hazards before they occur by identifying and
   studying past hazardous events. We provide warnings during volcanic
   crises by intensively monitoring restless volcanoes and interpreting
   results in the context of current hazards assessments. We investigate
   and report on hazardous events after they occur to improve our
   assessment and prediction skills, and to help develop new concepts of
   how volcanoes work. -- Excerpt from: Preparing for the Next Eruption in
   the Cascades, 1994
