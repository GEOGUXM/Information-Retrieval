   Do you want to send us a question?

   Unfortunately, there are very few of us here in Space Science at NASA
   HQ, and we are swamped with work. We cannot search the Web for you,
   answer general science questions, help you write your science project,
   or evaluate your personal theory. We encourage you to use the resources
   above, as well as your local library, encyclopedias, and online search
   engines. If you send us a specific question regarding the overall Space
   Science program, something we are uniquely in a position to answer, we
   will try to answer it. But before you ask, please check here to make
   sure that we haven't already answered it. Thanks!
