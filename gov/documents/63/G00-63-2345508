                         Economic & Community Development

      Since 1974, the City of Chattanooga has been the recipient of the
      entitlement funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
      Development (HUD) for a variety of housing and community development
      activities.  Planning for the use of the funds has always been a key
      element in successful revitalization projects.

      The Office of Economic and Community Development administers three
      federal programs through its office; the Community Development Block
      Grant (CDBG), the HOME Investment Partnership Act (HOME), and the
      Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG).
