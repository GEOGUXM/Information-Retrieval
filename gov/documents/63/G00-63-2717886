   Berkeley Lab is a multidisciplinary national laboratory that conducts
   nonclassified research. We are located in Berkeley, California on a
   site in the hills directly above the campus of the University of
   California at Berkeley.  Overlooking both the campus and San Francisco
   Bay, the site consists of 76 buildings located on 183 acres.

   People visit the Laboratory both to do research and for the pleasure of
   seeing and learning more about the Lab. In the case of those who visit
   to conduct research, each year the Lab hosts more than 2,000
   participating guests. The Laboratory also conducts public tours that
   showcase some of our national user facilities such as the Advanced
   Light Source and NERSC.  Tours are available by prior appointment.

   The Lab employs some 4,000 people -- about 1,000 staff scientists,
   almost a thousand undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral
   fellows, and more than 1,500 technical and support personnel.
