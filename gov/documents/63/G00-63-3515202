   Common Criteria / Methodology Development and Maintenance
   __________________________________________________

   Project Description: The Common Criteria (ISO/IEC 15408) is an
   international IT security standard that is being used by Federal
   agencies and industry for the evaluation of commercial products needed
   for the protection of government systems and networks. As the standard
   continues to be used worldwide, there is a demonstrated need for
   enhancements and modifications to the criteria based on lessons learned
   during actual evaluations. In addition, due to the subjective nature of
   the Common Criteria, there is a continuing need for standardized
   interpretations of requirements for all testing laboratories in
   participating evaluation and validation schemes around the world. This
   project provides the essential resources necessary to support ongoing
   Common Criteria and Common Evaluation Methodology maintenance tasks
   including the development of next generation criteria and methodology.

   Project Objectives: To develop necessary interpretations of Common
   Criteria security requirements and needed modifications and
   enhancements to the Common Criteria and Common Evaluation Methodology,
   as appropriate.
