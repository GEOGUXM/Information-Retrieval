SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION

13 CFR Part 121

RIN 3245-AE56


Small Business Size Standards; Inflation Adjustment to Size
Standards

AGENCY: Small Business Administration.

ACTION: Interim final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Small Business Administration (SBA) is adjusting its
monetary-based size standards, (e.g., receipts, net income, net worth,
and assets) for the effect of inflation. This action is intended to
maintain the value of size standards in inflation-adjusted terms. From
1994 to the third quarter of 2001 the general level of prices in the
United States increased approximately 15.8% as measured by the chain-
type price index for gross domestic product. This change will restore
eligibility to firms that may have lost small business status solely
due to the effect of inflation.
    SBA is adding a provision in its regulations that will require, at
least once every five years, an assessment of the inflationary impact
on monetary-based size standards. This periodic review will generally
ensure that monetary-based standards are current with inflationary
factors, as appropriate, and that firms will not lose small business
status due solely to the effect of inflation.
