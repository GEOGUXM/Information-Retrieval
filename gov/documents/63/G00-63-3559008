                      NEO EARTH CLOSE APPROACH TABLES

   Tables (updated daily) showing future and past NEO close-approach data,
   including uncertainties, are available sorted as follows:

     * (Future or Past) sorted by date
     * (Future or Past) sorted by nominal distance
     * (Future or Past) sorted by minimum possible distance
     * (Future or Past) sorted by N-sigma
     * (Future or Past) sorted by name

   More information about the uncertainties used in these tables is
   available.
