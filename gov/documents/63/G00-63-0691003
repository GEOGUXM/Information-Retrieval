                    About Flagstaff
   Community Profile
   Flagstaff, located at the intersection of Interstate 17 and l-40, is
   the largest city and is the regional center of northern Arizona. It is
   the county seat for Coconino County, the second largest county in the
   48 contiguous states, with 12 million acres. Flagstaff, at 7,000 feet,
   is one of the highest U.S. cities and its breath-taking backdrop is
   even higher. The community sits at the base of the San Francisco Peaks,
   Arizona's highest point at 12,633 feet.

   Flagstaff is a year-round mecca for visitors. Many Arizonans maintain
   second homes here. Summer temperatures average 20 degrees cooler than
   Phoenix which is 146 miles south on Interstate 17. In winter there is
   skiing, ice skating and hunting.

   Flagstaff has long been a transportation hub. Located along an old
   wagon road to California, Flagstaff began after the railroad arrived in
   1881. Today the town links 1-40 to l-17, Highway 89 to Page and Utah,
   and Highway 180 to the Grand Canyon. Historic Route 66 passes through
   Flagstaff.

   Flagstaff's name comes from a tall pine tree made into a flag pole in
   1876 to celebrate the Declaration of Independence Centennial.

   PRINCIPAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES

   Flagstaff is a governmental, educational, transportation, cultural and
   commercial center. Tourism is a major source of employment. Traditional
   economic activities continue to employ people.

   New scientific and high tech research and development industries have
   located in Flagstaff. Approximately 16,000 students attend Northern
   Arizona University. More than 100,000 people do business in Flagstaff,
   both in the historic downtown area and at several shopping centers.
   Most of Flagstaff is a designated Enterprise Zone.
