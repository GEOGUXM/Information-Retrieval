                            ALEXIS Current Status

    Recent Dual Ported Ram failures have resulted in data only available
    from telescope pairs #1 & #2 and from the Blackbeard experiment. Data
      quality in the telescopes has been degrading as solar maximum is
    approached. Telescope operations will be scaled back over the winter
     holiday break (Dec 24-Jan3) and will resume after the Y2K event has
                                    past.
