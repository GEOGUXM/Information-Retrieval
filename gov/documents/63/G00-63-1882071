Plea for restraint

   I am a NASA engineer that operates KSC's toplevel Internet Server, but
       I don't work for the Public Affairs Office. Currently there is
       nobody at KSC that is staffed full time to answer E-mail from the
       general public. The closest E-mail address for that function is
       webteam@news.ksc.nasa.gov. If you send E-mail to that address you
       will have a better chance of getting a response.
       I love my job and the space program and if I had more time, I
       wouldn't mind communicating with people about NASA. Unfortunately,
       after years of trying, I've realized that I can't possibly keep up
       with the flood of E-mail and do my real job as well. I currently
       get over 300 E-mail messages a day which equates to roughly a new
       E-mail message every 5 minutes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Due
       to other job duties, I get approximately 8 hours a week to devote
       to WWW activities. If I can spend the majority of this time
       improving the KSC WWW Services instead of answering E-mail, then
       more people can benefit. Please don't ask me to forward messages to
       an astronaut or get an autograph, I can't help you. The astronauts
       live at the Johnson Space Center and not the Kennedy Space Center.
       Please don't ask me to get you a launch pass, if you are interested
       in launch passes, read the section NASA Public Affairs Fact Sheet
       on getting Car Passes in the Frequently Asked questions section. If
       you want to find out about visiting the Kennedy Space Center,
       please go to the KSC Visitors Complex Home page or if you are
       interested in Space Camp, go to the U.S. Space Camp Home page.
       Also, please don't ask me how you can get a job out here. I can't
       help you but perhaps you should visit our Administration Office
       Home Page or the NASA Jobs Home Page.
       If you are trying to contact me to request a new feature to the
       WinVN Network News program, please use the WinVN mailing list
       winvn@news.ksc.nasa.gov instead or connect to the WinVN World Wide
       Web Home Page
       Please don't send me E-mail asking about the next shuttle launch,
       next non-manned launch or that you heard a rumor that a particular
       launch date slipped. I can only update our WWW site with published
       manifest information from our Public Affairs Office and I can't
       give you anymore information than what is currently available on
       the Shuttle Mission Information pages or the Shuttle Countdown
       pages. I also don't know anything about UFO's or the Face on Mars
       and inspite of what you may think, a failure to get a response from
       me about UFO's does not imply a NASA coverup. If you want to learn
       more about UFO's, Read the US Air Force Fact Sheet 95-03.
       Please don't ask me a question unless you've previously Searched
       the KSC WWW or the NASA Wide Search Engine for the answer. I am
       generally very slow in responding to individual questions (if at
       all) and you will probably get a faster response if you use the
       search option instead.
       However, Please do E-mail me if you need me to edit any links or if
       you find a problem with any links at KSC (generally ones that start
       with "http://www.ksc.nasa.gov") or if you find any items on the KSC
       server that are incorrect or not functioning.
