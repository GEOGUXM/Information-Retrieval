   Aviation Career Education "ACE" Camp Program

   One-week summer aviation education programs for middle and high school
   students which are co-sponsored by the FAA along with many other
   organizations. This program is designed to provide students with a wide
   range of aviation career exploration experiences. Focus is on aviation
   career clusters identified by FAA, with emphasis on opportunities for
   women and minorities. The plan is to have one program in each state and
   U.S. territory. This program reaches 1,500-2,000 students.

   These one-week summer programs expose students to a wide range of
   aviation career exploration. Students experience instruction in
   aviation history, the physics of flight, field trips to aviation sites
   and hands-on activities. Dates, locations, cost and age requirements
   vary according to sponsoring organizations.
