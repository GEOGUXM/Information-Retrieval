AIPL Email Announcements

   We have developed TWO email announcement systems that are available to
   any user who subscribes:
     __________________________________________________________________

What's New Listserver

   Subscribers to this list will receive email notification when there is
   something new at AIPL's web site. A summary of the new information will
   be provided in the email, with a link to the complete information. This
   list will enable subscribers to know immediately when AIPL's What's New
   Page has been updated.

   Please ensure your e-mail address is correct before submitting your
   request!

Evaluation Listserver

   Subscribers to this list will receive email announcements when the
   evaluation files have been posted at the AIPL web site. As well, if any
   errors are detected in the evaluations, subscribers will be informed
   immediately of the problem and/or correction (we hope we will not need
   it for this use).

   Please ensure your e-mail address is correct before submitting your
   request!
