   Modeling of multiphase flows in industrial applications

          Co-investigator for the development of a modeling capability of
          gas and mixed solids in multiphase flows.



   Self-organizing knowledge creation on distributed networks with human
   interaction

     Founder of a new project for the enhancement and investigation of
     problem solving on distributed networks that combine unique
     abilities of information networks and human problem solving.
     Research focuses on mechanisms for the higher system functionality
     based on self-organizing problem solving, without competition or
     cooperation.


   Role of diversity in social, ecological, economic, and organizational
   systems.

     Studies into the role of diversity across many natural and human
     systems, focusing on the how diversity can be either advantageous or
     detrimental to the global processes.

    injection.

     Principal Investigator on multi-laboratory project to develop an
     opposed-piston diesel engine.

    Inertially-confined fusion.

     One of three designers in the development of a novel concept for
     inertially confined fusion.

    Interface reconstruction in CAVEAT, an ALE code.

     Co-developed and implemented the first interface reconstruction of
     mixed cells in a nonorthogonal mesh.

    Modeling of low speed viscoelastic and Newtonian flows.

     Developed an original numerical method for solving complex
     viscoelastic flow problems; included the first free-Lagrangian
     technique for incompressible fluid flow; also included artificial
     intelligence techniques in solution method.

    Development of code for cavity radiation and radiation to outer surfaces.

     nonisotropic material properties.

    Solving sets of highly nonlinear algebraic equations.

     Developed numerical convergence techniques for highly nonlinear
     algebraic equations that increase radius and speed of convergence,
     included first known technique that employed self-regulation (A.I.
     techniques) to optimize convergence properties.

    Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics in polymeric systems.

     Developed the first nonlinear molecular model to describe the change
     in non-Newtonian viscoelastic behavior from dilute to semidilute
     polymer solutions.

     Co-developed the first nonlinear chain model for describing
     nonlinear viscoelasticity.
