        West Nile Virus

   Culex pipiens mosquito After a second winter of dormancy, the West Nile
   Virus reappeared for the 2001 season: hundreds of dead crows found this
   summer -  from Canada to Florida, Maryland to Wisconsin - have tested
   positive for the virus. Confined largely to the northeastern states in
   1999, the virus was detected in dead birds found throughout the
   mid-Atlantic and upper southeast in 2000. As of September 2001, more
   than 150 dead birds have already tested positive for WNV, and one human
   death has been attributed to the virus. Scientists suspect that the
   actual numbers of infected birds, and humans, may be much higher than
   these figures. Human and wildlife health experts anticipate the slow
   but steady spread of WNV to new states, as well as a continued presence
   across the Eastern seaboard of the United States.
     * according to the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, 76 bird
       species have been infected with the West Nile Virus. Certain wild
       and domesticated mammals have also tested positive.
     * last year, two human deaths from encephalitis were attributed to
       the West Nile Virus; seven such deaths occurred in 1999.
     * as of September 2001, the virus has been detected in wildlife
       populations in 18 states, as well as in Canada: as far north as
       Toronto, as far west as Milwaukee, as far south as northern
       Florida, and across the Eastern seaboard.
