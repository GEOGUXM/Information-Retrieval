   JET-EFDA Jun 00 * The FIRE web site has been developed to make
   information on FIRE and fusion science accessible and up to date. A
   steady stream of about 150 visitors per week log on to the FIRE web
   site since the site was initiated in early July, 1999. Burning Plasma
   Physics is Widely Accepted as the Primary Objective for a Next Step in
   Fusion Research * Grunder Panel and Madison Forum endorsed Burning
   Plasmas as next step. * NRC Interim Report identified "integrated
   physics of a self-heated plasma" as one of the critical unresolved
   fusion science issues. * The Snowmass Fusion Summer Study endorsed the
   burning plasma physics objective, and that the tokamak was technically
   ready for high-gain experiment. * R. Pellat, Chair of the CCE-FU has
   stated that "the demonstration of a sustained burning plasma is the
   next goal" for the European Fusion Program. * SEAB noted that "There is
   general agreement that the next large machine should, at least, be one
   that allows the scientific exploration of burning plasmas" and if Japan
   and Europe do not proceed with ITER "the U. S. should pursue a less
   ambitious machine that will allow the exploration of the relevant
   science at lower cost." "In any event the preliminary planning for such
   a machine should proceed now so as to allow the prompt pursuit of this
   option." Physics Requirements for Next Step Experiments Study Physics
   of Fusion Plasmas (transport, pressure limits, etc.) * Same plasma
   physics if * = /a, = c/ b and are equal Requires BR5/4 to be equal to
   that of a fusion plasma Study Physics of Burning Plasmas (alpha
   confinement, self heating, etc) * Alpha particle confinement requires

   edge) provides flexibility for lower current AT modes without large
   alpha losses due to ripple. * Double-null divertor configuration for
   H-mode and AT modes with helium pumping that is
   maintainable/replaceable/upgradeable remotely * Double wall vacuum
   vessel with integral shielding (ITER-like) to reduce neutron dose to TF
   and PF coils, and machine structure. * Cooling to LN2 allows full field

   Innovations have Markedly Improved the Technical Basis for a Compact

   (1989-1999) have developed enhanced confinement modes that scale
   (e.g.,ITER-98H) 1.3 times higher than the 1989 CIT design assumption.
   Alcator C-Mod - the prototype for Compact High Field tokamaks has
   shown: * Confinement in excess of 1.4 times the 1989 design guidelines
   for CIT and ~1.15 times the recent ITER-98H design guidelines. *
   Successful ICRF heating at high density in shaped diverted plasmas. *
   Successful detached divertor operation at high power density. D-T
   experiments on TFTR and JET have shown: * Tritium can be handled safely
   in a laboratory fusion experiment!!! * D-T plasmas behaved roughly as
   predicted with slight improvements in confinement in plasmas with weak
   alpha-heating. Engineering Innovations to increase capability and

   Access High-Gain Advanced Tokamak Regimes for Long Durations * The
   coupling of advanced tokamak modes with strongly burning plasmas is a
   generic issue for all advanced "toroidal" systems. The VLT PAC,
   Snowmass Burning Plasma and Energy Subgroup B recommended that a
   burning plasma experiment should have AT capability. * FIRE, with
   strong plasma shaping, flexible double null poloidal divertor, low TF
   ripple, dual inside launch pellet injectors, and space reserved for the
   addition of current drive (LHCD) and/or a smart conducting wall, has
   the capabilities needed to investigate advanced tokamak regimes in a
   high gain burning plasma. * The LN inertially cooled TF coil has a
   pulse length capability ~250 s at 4T for DD plasmas. This long pulse -
   AT capability rivals that of any existing divertor tokamak or any under
   construction. The coils are not the limit. * Recent AT regimes on
   DIII-D (Shot 98977) sustained for ~ 16 !E serve as demonstration
   discharges for initial AT experiments on FIRE. Need to develop
   self-consistent scenarios with profile control on FIRE with durations ~

   Year * Even with ITER, the magnetic fusion program will be unable to
   address the alpha- dominated burning plasma issues for 15 years. *
   Compact High-Field Tokamak Burning Plasma Experiment(s) would be a
   natural extension of the ongoing "advanced" tokamak program and could
   begin alpha- dominated experiments by ~ 10 years. * More than one high
   gain burning plasma facility is needed in the world program. * The
   information "exists now" to make a technical assessment, and decision
   on a magnetic fusion burning plasma experiment(s) for the next decade.

   Issues for FIRE and Magnetic Fusion The critical physics and
   engineering issues for FIRE are the same as those for fusion, the goal
   of FIRE is to help resolve these issues for magnetic fusion. The issues
   and questions listed below need to be addressed in the near future. *
   Physics - confinement - H-mode threshold, edge pedestal, enhanced
   H-mode, AT-modes - stability - NTMs, RWM, disruptions: conducting wall?
   feedback coils? VDE(DN)? - heating and current drive - ICRF is
   baseline: NBI & LHCD as upgrades? - boundary - detached divertor
   operation, impurity levels, confinement - self-heating - fast alpha
   physics and profile effects of alpha heating Development of
   self-consistent self-heated AT modes with external controls *
   Engineering - divertor and first wall power handling (normal operation
   and disruptions) - divertor, first wall and vacuum vessel for long
   pulse AT modes - evaluate low inventory tritium handling scenarios,
   higher fluence TF insulator - complete many engineering details
   identified in FIRE Engineering Report - evaluate potential sites for
   Next Step MFE experiment - complete cost estimate for baseline,
   identify areas for cost reduction Major Conclusions of the FIRE Design
   Study * Exploration, understanding and optimization of alpha-dominated
   (high-gain) burning plasmas are critical issues for all approaches to
   fusion. * The tokamak is a cost-effective vehicle to investigate
   alpha-dominated fusion plasma physics and its coupling to advanced
   toroidal physics for MFE. The tokamak is technically ready for a next
   step to explore fusion plasma physics. * The FIRE compact high field
   tokamak can address the important alpha- dominated plasma issues, many
   of the long pulse advanced tokamak issues and begin the integration of
   alpha-dominated plasmas with advanced toroidal physics in a $1B class
   facility. * The FIRE design point has been chosen to be a "stepping
   stone" between the physics accessible with present experiments and the
   physics required for the ARIES vision of magnetic fusion energy. * A
   plan is being developed for an Advanced Tokamak Next Step that will
   address physics, engineering and cost issues in FY 2000-1 with the goal
   of being ready to begin a Conceptual Design in 2002.
