                        Solar Absorption Spectrometry

   During the brief passage of solar radiation through the Earth's
   atmosphere, certain frequencies are selectively absorbed. Since each
   different atmospheric gas has its own unique absorption pattern,
   determined from laboratory measurements on pure gas samples, it is
   possible to determine which gases are present in the atmosphere and
   quantify their abundances. To date, over 30 different gases have been
   measured using this technique including H[2]O, CO[2], O[3], N[2]O, CO,
   CH [4], N[2], O[2], NO, NO[2], HNO [3 ], HNO[4], N[2]O[5], ClNO[3 ],
   HOCl, HCl, HF, SF[6], COF[2], CF[4], CH [3]Cl, CHFCl [2], CFCl[3],
   CF[2]Cl [2], CCl[4 ], OCS, HCN, C[2]H[2], C [2]H[6] and many isotopic
   variants.

   Ozone is created and destroyed by complex reactions involving
   ultraviolet radiation from the sun and gases in the middle atmosphere.
   While some of those gases occur naturally, concentrations of
   destructive chemicals are increasing due to human activity. To fully
   understand the many factors that drive atmospheric chemical reactions
   and to predict changes, scientists must have a comprehensive knowledge
   of the gases which make up the atmosphere.
