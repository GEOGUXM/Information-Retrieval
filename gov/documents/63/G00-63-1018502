    Distribution Tree Hierarchy
     In general, the implementation of the API is isolated to the gov/nist
   branch of the tree. Classes that are defined as part of the
   specification have thier implementation at that location (i.e., JavaTV
   classes are implemented in the javax.tv.* branch of the tree, where as
   the JavaTV interfaces are implemented under the gov.nist.* branch of
   the tree).

    Release Notes
     The NIST DASE Development Environment PAE prototype implementation
   adheres to the ATSC DASE specification (version T3-531 R4) dated
   November 20, 2001.
     __________________________________________________________________

     The Simulation platform requires JDK 1.2 and a C compiler (for
   certain features). The NIST system uses GNU C 2.8.1. The API
   implementation only uses classes defined in the DASE pJava
   specification ( i.e., pJava plus some additional classes). However, the
   entire NIST Development Environment (API implementation and STB
   simulation) is built and ran using the JDK version 1.2 which is not
   pJava only. Specifically, the simulation platform makes use of classes
   that are not found in DASE pJava. NIST has produced its own internal
   version of the DASE pJava libraries for testing the API implementation.
   However, due to copyright and IP issues, we can not distribute this jar
   file.

     The implementation of data carousels required modification to the
   Java Runtime Envoronment (JRE). Specifically, functionality was added
   to several java.io classes. Because changes were made to the Java
   source code, they are not included as part of the NIST DASE Development
   Environemnt distribution. Instructions to make these modifications can
   be found in the User's Guide and in the README file that comes with the
   source code distribution.

     The stubs org.atsc.dom and org.w3c.dom packages exist in the
   distribution tree. However, none of these classes are implemented.
