   Mint Police

   Established in 1792, the United States Mint Police is one of the oldest
   federal law enforcement agencies in the nation.  Responsible for
   establishing the standard "As secure as Fort Knox," our officers
   continue to meet that standard everyday.  The U.S. Mint Police are
   responsible for protecting over $100 billion in Treasury and other
   Government assets stored in facilities located at Philadelphia, PA; San
   Francisco, CA; West Point, NY; Denver, CO; Fort Knox, KY; and our
   headquarters in Washington, DC.

   Today, U.S. Mint Police Officers have the primary responsibility for
   protecting life and property, preventing, detecting, and investigating
   criminal acts, collecting and preserving evidence, making arrests, and
   enforcing Federal and local laws.

    employees, thousands of visitors and $100 billion in gold, silver and
                                   coinage
