   The goal of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) is to
   facilitate the process of bringing promising, novel, investigational
   anticancer and anti-HIV agents to the public as quickly and as safely
   as possible. CTEP offers a unique combination of resources and
   expertise to assist an Industry Collaborator in clinical development of
   new therapeutic agents and the ability to evaluate investigational
   agents in a wide variety of tumor types and disease settings. This
   section of the CTEP web site provides information regarding the process
   for co-developing an investigational anticancer agent with the NCI. In
   addition, we have provided links to other online resources to assist
   with technology development, clinical development resources, and small
   business research funding.

   For those of you who want to learn about the policies and procedures
   involved in clinical drug development, CTEP has developed the
   Investigator's Handbook (now available online!). If you want to find
   information on research and funding by NCI for AIDS-related
   malignancies, we have developed the AIDS-Oncology Resources site for
   basic and clinical research. We hope you find this information useful,
   and please give us feedback on how we can make this site more useful.
