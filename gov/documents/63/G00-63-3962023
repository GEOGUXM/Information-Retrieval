      A search on "usa" will match "Usa", "USA", and "usA", while the term
      "USA" matches only its uppercase version.

      The asterisk is a powerful search tool, but has some limitations. It
      cannot span words - that is, the query "powerfu*earch" would not match
      the first sentence of this paragraph - and it can represent at most
      four letters or numbers. To avoid overly broad searches, the asterisk
      can only be used in words or phrases which have at least three
      alpha-numeric characters. A search for "th*" would be ignored.
