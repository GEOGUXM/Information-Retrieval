        adoption social worker at your local Division of Children and Family
        Services office.

        your birth parent and whether you have filed a certified statement
        with the Health Department that allows or prohibits release of
        information about you to your biological parent. If the petition is
        granted, the court appoints someone called a "confidential
        intermediary." The intermediary discreetly searches for the birth
        parent(s). If the birth parent(s) is not alive, or can't be located,
        the intermediary searches for immediate birth parent family members.
