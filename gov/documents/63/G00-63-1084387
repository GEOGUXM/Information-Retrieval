                       "Algie Lance Best Paper Award"



     This years Algie Lance Best Paper Award conferred at the 2001
     Measurement Science Conference (MSC) was won by Joseph R. Kinard, Jr.
     and Thomas E. Lipe, Jr. in EEELs Electricity Division and to their
     co-authors T.F. Wunch, R.P. Manginell,O.P. Solomon of the Sandia
     National Laboratories, and K.C. Jungling of the University of New
     Mexico. The title of their paper was Recent Advances in Ac-dc Transfer
     Measurements Using Thin-filmThermal Converters. In this paper, the
     authors described recent success in designing and fabricating new,
     thin-film thermal converters having improved sensitivity and accuracy
     over conventional single-junction thermoelements. The MSC 2001 was held
     this year on January 15-19 in Anaheim, CA.
