                                How to Navigate
        _____________________________________________________________

     In addition to the normal web browsing, you can found your way
     around our site using a number of navigational tools.

     Home Home will return you to the opening page for the site from
     anywhere.

     Index For a quick rundown of the topics available, and/or to jump to
     a specific page, use the Index.

     Forward To browse forward through the pages in a (somewhat) linear
     fashion, use the Forward button. This is useful if you wish to take
     a "tour" of the site.

     Back To jump out of a topic, use the Back button. This will return
     you to the next level up.

     Top Top will take you up to the top of whatever page you are on.

     DOL ETA These buttons will take you to the Department of Labor and
     the Employment and Training Administration Home Pages.

     Both the Forward button and the Back button may not always take you
     where you expect to go, due to the "web" nature of this site. Use
     the Index if you get lost. We also have plans to implement a search
     engine for this site in the future.
