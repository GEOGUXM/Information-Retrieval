                              Data Usage Policy

   We make preliminary sequencing data available as a service to the
   scientific community. Due to the considerable investment in time and
   effort in acquiring these data, we ask that if you use preliminary data
   obtained from this site you follow these guidelines. Users of
   unfinished data should not publish or otherwise release this data
   without proper acknowledgement. The form of proper acknowledgement is
   as follows:

   "This sequence data was produced by the Brookhaven Genomics Group at
   Brookhaven National Laboratory. They can be obtained from the BGG
   web-site at HTTP://genome.bnl.gov/Sequence"

   All data should have a genbank ascension number, either in the normal
   section or in the HTG division.
   When using unfinished data please use the latest version. We are
   constantly finishing data, and correcting errors as they are found. If
   you are planning to use unfinished data please contact us so we can
   make sure you have the latest version.

  Disclaimer

   The Brookhaven Bacterial Genomics Group provides these data in good
   faith, but makes no warranty, nor assumes any legal liability or
   responsibility for any purpose for which the data are used.
