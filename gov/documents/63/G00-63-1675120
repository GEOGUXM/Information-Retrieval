            Alaska Primary Care & Rural Health Unit

   The Alaska Primary Care & Rural Health Unit, also referred to as the
   Alaska Primary Care Office (PCO), works to improve access to primary
   health care for the underserved, increase availability of primary
   health care providers in underserved areas, increase access to maternal
   and child health services for at-risk populations, and maximize public
   and private reimbursement for community-based primary care services.

   Staff within the unit analyze the state's health policy environment,
   the unmet need for preventive and primary care services, and the
   state's major health disparities and marketplaces. In partnership with
   other organizations, the staff also develop integrated strategies and
   activities to strengthen and expand preventive and primary care
   capacity.

   The Alaska PCO also maintains a list-serve, where we post important
   events, information about community funding opportunities, and other
   information of interest to the primary care community. To subscribe,
