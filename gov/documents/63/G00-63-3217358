   Principle Collaborators

   DOD Role
   The Mojave Desert Ecosystem Program (MDEP) represents a Department of
   Defense (DOD) effort to meld together a shared scientific database that
   can be used to affect dynamic sustainable land management decisions. It
   is not itself a management process, but a tool to enable more accurate
   modeling of environmental factors that will facilitate data driven
   management within the Mojave ecoregion. The program directly supports
   the military readiness in the region through provision of a framework
   for determining research strategies, mitigation measures and designing
   enlightened, long-term resource planning to ensure ongoing activities,
   including training mission objectives. It will provide all users
   (federal, state, local, and private) easy Internet access to
   georeferenced natural and cultural resource data for the entire
   ecoregion. The program is a model for the sharing and integration of
   data and expertise from a long list of participants including the
   National Training Center, Fort Irwin; Naval Air Weapons Station, China
   Lake; Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards Air Force Base; Marine
   Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Twenty Nine Palms; and Marine Corps
   Logistics Base, Barstow.

   DMG Role
   The California Desert Managers Group (DMG) was formed to provide desert
   wide operational collaboration for ecosystem management, customer
   service and organizational efficiency. The DMG was instrumental in the
   formulation, support and guidance of the MDEP. Through its Science and
   Data Management Team, a major role of the DMG has been to provide the
   link between the technological capabilities and the on the ground user
   requirements for a diverse array of agency missions and management
   directions. This overview provides the priorities for data collection,
   the encouragement for funding and the coordination of input from on
   going science and research projects.

   BLM Role
   The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) provided the Assistance
   Representative for the project that also was the focal point for all
   administrative activities. In this role the BLM provided the
   administrative oversight for the Task Order with Utah State University
   (USU.), the Interagency Cooperative Agreement with the US Geological
   Survey, and the Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of
   Defense at Ft. Irwin. They CO-chaired the Legacy Management Oversight
   Group (LMOG) and assisted in facilitation needed to accomplish each of
   the four identified Phases of the USU. Task Order. The BLM provided
   extensive field data for the project and participated in recommending
   of priorities to the USU. Task Order. Each of the LMOG meetings
   logistical support, agendas and final minutes for the project were
   carried out by the BLM. The Bureau was also the focal point for all
   financial support functions of the project as it related to the above
   mentioned agreements and MOU.

   USGS Role
   The US Geological Survey (USGS) designed the Mojave Clearinghouse
   Network, provided much of the data, and served as science advisor for
   the program. The Mojave Clearinghouse Network was established with a
   main node at Ft. Irwin using Internet protocols compliant with National
   Spatial Data Infrastructure guidelines. Digital topographic, geologic,
   and soils data were interpreted and mosaicked to provide seamless
   regional coverage. These data as well as digital cartographic and image
   data, and assistance with map production, were provided to Utah State
   University for integration and distribution of data for the Task Order.
   USGS was represented on the Legacy Management Oversight Group (LMOG)
   where they provided scientific advice.

   USU Role
   The College of Natural Resources at Utah State University (USU) was
   given the lead role for the execution of the Mojave Desert Ecosystem
   Program. USU provided the technical expertise and management required
   to design, compile, and realize the MDEP. Collaboration with the US
   Geological Survey, who was charged with the design and implementation
   phase of the network delivery system for the Mojave Clearinghouse
   Network, provided an integrated system to assemble, store, and deliver
   environmental data. USU was responsible for accomplishing the spatial
   data acquisition and assembly into unified seamless coverage. Data were
   made accessible through the creation of user-interfaces that facilitate
   queries and data recovery.

   MDEP Acknowledgments

   The following is an acknowledgement of the personnel who supported the
   MDEP activities during the production phase. Their contributions helped
    to ensure success in the development and implementation of the MDEP.
     Every attempt has been made to identify all the principles in this
   effort, whether supporting the MDEP on a full time or part time basis.
