              FEMA Approves Grant For N.C. State Highway Patrol

     Atlanta, G.A., January 14, 2002 -- The Federal Emergency Management
    Agency (FEMA) has approved a grant of $690,000 to the North Carolina
   State Highway Patrol to expand its radio communication system as a key
   element in safely evacuating coastal North Carolina during hurricanes.

    "It is critical that state and local law enforcement agencies be able
     to communicate with each other during natural disasters," said FEMA
    Region IV Director Kenneth O. Burris, Jr. "This expanded radio system
   will help in moving evacuees away from the coast well in advance of any
      approaching hurricane and will minimize the potential for loss of
                                   life."

     "The system will support radio communications from Brunswick County
   north to the Carteret County beaches and inland along the I-40 corridor
     to I-95," according to N.C. Highway Patrol Commander Colonel R. W.
    Holden. "This is the area of North Carolina that hurricanes have hit
        most often during the past 10 years and where seamless voice
      communications system for state and local partners is absolutely
                                   vital."
