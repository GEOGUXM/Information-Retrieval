       projects;
     * educate personnel on how to use metrics and lifecycle cost
       analysis;
     * engage trainees in best practice scenarios and scenario-based
       exercises;
     * improve energy efficiency and water conservation programs;
     * and provide sufficient training with minimal disruption to the
       user's work pattern.

   This residential program will include meals, lodging, tuition, tips and
    gratuities, funded by NASA Headquarters. Centers will be responsible
