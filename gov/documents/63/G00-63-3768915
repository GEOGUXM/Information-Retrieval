                                     Join your hosts Brandt Secosh
                                     and Mike Ciannilli

                                     Live from the Kennedy Space Center

                                     This series will follow the processing of the Shuttle from landing
   through Launch, introducing you to the people of NASA who are
   responsible for the various jobs involved. Each episode will surround a
   WebCast accompanied by a full complement of chats with NASA experts who
   are working in the area covered by the preceding episode. Preparation
   and lesson materials will be referenced to assist teacher use in the
   classroom. Lesson plans will be gathered from a variety of sources, and
   we will make every attempt to cover a variety of curricular needs.
   These will include primarily fifth grade through university materials,
   but there are easy adaptations for younger and older students. We
   encourage your creativity and would be delighted to have you share your
   ideas with us. Feel free to send your contributions and concerns to:
   Linda Conrad.
