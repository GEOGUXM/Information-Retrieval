   Evans' Papers Released

      The Secretary of State's Office Archives Division has finished
      processing the papers of our state's only three-term governor, Dan
      Evans. The papers detail Evans' extraordinary career in public service
      that spanned three decades.

      From 1956 to 1964, Evans served in the Washington State House of
      Representatives. He was then elected Governor of Washington three
      times, leading the state of Washington from 1965 to 1977. Evans also
      served as President of The Evergreen State College and Chairman of the
      Northwest Power Planning Council.

      Evans' return to public service came in 1983 after the death of Senator
      Henry "Scoop" Jackson. Washington State Governor John Spellman
      appointed Evans to the United States Senate to fill Jackson's seat. He
      then won a special Senate election on November 8, 1983 to serve out the
      rest of the term, which expired in January of 1989. While in the
      Senate, Evans served on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and
      the Foreign Relations Committee. He was vice-chairman of the Select
      Committee on Indian Affairs.

      The "Guide to the Papers of U.S. Senator Daniel J. Evans" is a
      file-level catalog of Evans' papers, listing the file titles and dates
      of the material within each file. In addition to his Senatorial papers,
      it includes collections of Evans' personal and private papers.
