   WHAT IS AN INSPECTION?

     A property inspection is the way that the City ensures that new and
     remodeled buildings are constructed according to the plans approved
     by the Department of Planning and Building. By actively inspecting
     in-progress and completed construction, the City can help ensure
     that buildings meet all health and safety regulations.

   WHEN IS AN INSPECTION NEEDED?

     Any work which requires a permit will require inspections (a
     separate brochure called "Construction Permits" can help determine
     if a project requires a permit). When a permit is received, an
     Inspection Record Card will be issued. This card must be posted on
     the job site. The plans which were approved by the Planning and
     Building Department must also be available during each inspection.

   HOW CAN AN INSPECTION BE ARRANGED?

     The Inspection Record will indicate the first inspection required
     for a job. An inspection request can be made by calling (562)
     570-6105.

     This number is connected to an answering machine and should be used
     only to request inspections. These machines are available 24 hours a
     day. When calling to request an inspection, please have the
     following information available:
    1. The address of the job.
    2. Type of inspection required.
    3. The type of building (i.e. single family, apartment, commercial)

     During the first inspection, the inspector will determine the amount
     of work which can be completed before the next inspection. Do not
     work past this point. This process will be repeated for each
     succeeding inspection.

     Some commonly needed inspections are:
     * Grading: If a project requires grading of the site before
       construction, a registered inspector must be on-site to provide
       continuous inspection during grading. In most cases grading is
       necessary only for projects requiring the removal or addition of
       large amounts of earth.
     * Foundation/Slab: This inspection is performed after rough grading
       and placement of concrete forms and reinforcing steel, but prior to
       pouring any concrete.
     * Framing: Inspection is required after the roof covering is
       installed, doors and windows installed, flashed, and caulked, and
       electrical, plumbing and heating systems are prepared for rough
       inspection.
     * Energy Insulation: Inspection is required after installation, but
       prior to walls and ceilings being covered.
     * Lath/Drywall: Exterior lath is inspected after interior nailing of
       wall cover is completed and paper and wire have been nailed and
       trim is in place.
     * Final: This last inspection will occur when all fixtures are in
       place and the building is ready for occupancy.

   HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?

     The cost of building inspection is included in the permit fee.
     However, there is a $30.00 reinspection fee if an inspection call is
     made but the work is not ready for inspection or required
     corrections have not been completed. A reinspection fee will also be
     charged if the approval plans are not available or the inspector
     cannot gain access to the site to perform the inspection.

   SPECIAL INSPECTIONS

     Special inspections are a service offered by the Planning and
     Building Department to assist property owners in determining the
     condition of an existing building.

     A special inspection is sometimes required by lending agencies when
     a property is sold or refinanced. Before starting a major
     remodeling, a Special Inspection for minimum housing requirements
     may help identify any existing hazardous conditions. Some new
     businesses will also require Special Inspections in order to obtain
     a business license.

     Separate inspections of the electrical plumbing, mechanical, and
     structural systems in buildings are available.

     Homeowners can receive a combined inspection covering minimum
     housing health and safety requirements.

     Owners will only be required to repair problem areas which have the
     potential to pose a life-safety hazard.

   HOW MUCH DOES A SPECIAL INSPECTION COST?

     The fees for special inspections normally range from $65 - $120.00;
     however, the fee may be greater for large or complex projects.

     Further information can be obtained by calling (562) 570-6651
     between 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.
