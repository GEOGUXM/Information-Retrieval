   Real-Time Control Systems Library -- Software and Documentation
        __________________________________________________________________

      The Real-Time Control Systems library is an archive of free C++ and
      Java code, scripts, tools, makefiles, and documentation developed to
      aid programmers of software to be used in real-time control systems
      (especially those using the Reference Model Architecture for
      Intelligent Systems Design).

      The following documents describe the library in more detail:

      Public FTP RCS Library Download Directory
             The directory containing all the ".tar.Z" and ".zip" files with
             source code, compiled object files, tools, etc related to the
             RCS Library. (See getrcs.html. for instructions.)

      OSU/NIST-RCS Library: Tools for Control System Development
             The Control Research Laboratory (CRL) at the Department of
             Electrical Engineering at The Ohio State University is currently
             working in coordination with NIST to develop a catalog of
             generic controller and estimation routines for the NIST-RCS
             Library. At their web site you will find:

             + A catalog of downloadable generic controller and estimation
               routines that can be used in both RCS and non-RCS
               applications,
             + A short introduction the theory and methodology of RCS,
             + A description of a university laboratory course on the RCS
               Library,
             + A description of a handbook that is currently being written
               about the RCS Library,
             + A short description of some of the current NIST RCS
               applications, and
