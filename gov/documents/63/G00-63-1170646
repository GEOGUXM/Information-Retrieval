                            Year 2000 seismicity
          Seismicity on the Big Island of Hawai`i for the year 2000

   Vast amounts of seismic data provide a wealth of information on the
   active processes occurring within and beneath Hawai`i's volcanoes.
   Seismologists at HVO study the regional seismicity of the Island of
   Hawai`i, in particular the tectonic and volcanic earthquakes as they
   relate to major fault zones and to the eruptions and intrusions of
   magma. Volcanic earthquakes are directly associated with magma
   movement; earthquake swarms frequently precede eruptions or accompany
   intrusions. Commonly, earthquakes occur ahead of intruding magma,
   permitting us to anticipate the probable location of the outbreak of
   lava at the surface. On the other hand, tectonic earthquakes occur in
   fault zones or other regions away from the principal areas of magma
   movement.

Annual Seismicity for 1992 through 2000

   Learning to identify the various types of seismic signatures recorded
   on our seismographs is the first basic step to understanding Hawaiian
   seismicity. Our seismographs record ground vibrations caused not only
   by natural phenomena but also by human and cultural activity. Different
   kinds of earthquakes will also have different seismic signatures.
