   Summary

   The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) invites
   interested parties to submit applications for the Charge grant program.
   The purpose of the Charge program is to help create a network of public
   access electric vehicle (EV) charging stations throughout the Bay Area.
   Grants will be available to both public and private entities to
   purchase and install EV chargers within the boundaries of the
   nine-county BAAQMD. Funding for the Charge program is provided by the
   Transportation Fund for Clean Air (TFCA), administered by the BAAQMD.

   Background

   The vast majority of CaliforniaÂ’s populace, including San Francisco Bay
   Area residents, live in regions with air quality problems. The Bay Area
   is currently designated as a non-attainment area for the federal ozone
   standard. Tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks are the primary
   source of air pollution in the Bay Area. Emissions from oil refining as
   well as pumping at gas stations are also significant sources of air
   pollution. To address the automobile's impact on air quality, the
   California Air Resources Board issued a zero emission vehicle mandate
   that requires increasing electric vehicle (EV) sales over time. As a
   result of the mandate, major automobile manufacturers are now marketing
   battery operated EVs in California. Zero-emission EVs offer great
   promise for reducing motor vehicle emissions, but they are not
   currently widely used in the Bay Area. One barrier to increased market
   penetration of EVs is their limited driving range. While EVs may
   operate well on the local level, drivers remain concerned about
   regional trips. To increase EV range and boost consumer confidence, a
   network of public access EV charging stations is needed in the Bay
   Area. Substantial EV charging networks have already been installed in
   the Los Angeles and Sacramento areas.

   Program Description

   Charge grants will be available to both public and private entities
   throughout the BAAQMD to purchase and install EV chargers. All charger
   stations must be accessible to the general public. Charge grants will
   be limited to 40% of the total cost to purchase and install one
   inductive charger and one conductive charger, with a maximum funding
   cap of $7,000 for such a charging site. Exceptions may be made for
   locations that wish to install only one form of charger, in which case
   a grant of $3,500 will be available, regardless of the number of
   chargers installed. If three or more chargers are desired, sites may
   have the $7,000 cap increased by $1,000 for each additional charger
   beyond the first conductive and inductive charger. Only one grant award
   will be available per site.

   Information on EV Charging Systems

   The hardware and installation for all chargers that receive Charge
   grants must comply with the "Level 2" EV charging standards established
   in SAE 1772 / NEC 625. A description of EV charging technology is
   available on the California Energy Commission website at
   www.energy.ca.gov/afvs/ev/evtech.html. The site also describes building
   codes and standards that apply to EV charging sites.

   How to Apply

   To apply for a Charge! grant, the site owner must complete the
   "Application Form." (See Attachment A included in the downloadable
   files at the top of the page.) Potential applicants are encouraged to
   contact BAAQMD staff (see below) to discuss their site prior to
   submitting an application. Applications may be submitted at any time.
   The application must include an estimate of the hardware and
   installation costs for the charging site. BAAQMD staff can provide
   references to qualified contractors who can perform estimates and
   install chargers.

   Applications for Charge funds will be evaluated by BAAQMD staff based
   upon the "Site Selection Criteria." (See Attachment B included in the
   downloadable files at the top of the page.) Owners of approved sites
   will be required to enter into a written contract with the BAAQMD to
   ensure compliance with the terms of the grant. Grant funds will not be
   disbursed until the charger(s) are fully installed and operational.
