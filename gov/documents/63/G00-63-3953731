     13 Key Questions

     The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an agency of the US
     Department of Agriculture, provides technical assistance, information,
     and advice to citizens in their efforts to conserve soil, water, plant,
     animal, and air resources on private lands. Employees of NRCS,
     cooperating agencies and groups, the conservation partnerships, and
     local partners deliver services to customers through 2500 county
     offices (USDA Service Centers). NRCS managers and strategic planners
     ask thirteen key questions to determine how effective the agency and
     conservation partnerships are in accomplishing their mission.
