   Solicitations


   The Solicitations Process

   OIT provides about $150 million annually in cost-shared funding for
   R&D. We award this funding through an open, competitive solicitation
   process designed to meet the top technology needs identified in
   industry's roadmaps. Industry representatives often participate in the
   technical review process.

   Our solicitations typically require collaborative partnerships, which
   may include manufacturers, universities, suppliers, national labs, and
   others. Industry partners are generally expected to provide matching
   funds (equal to the Federal investment).

   Streamlining
   We recently streamlined our solicitation process so that successful R&D
   partnerships can receive their funds faster and begin work sooner. Is
   there a solicitation you'd like to pursue?

   Active Solicitations
   Check out our active solicitations table for cost-sharing opportunities
   that meet the efficiency improvement needs of your business. We list
   all OIT solicitations that are currently open and accepting proposals.

   Future Solicitations
   Plan ahead. Scan our future solicitations table for a list of requests
   for proposals that will be made by OIT in the near future.

   Closed Solicitations
   Our closed solicitations table provides you a 6-month history of
   requests for proposals that have been released by OIT and are now
   closed. When available, information on award recipients is provided.
