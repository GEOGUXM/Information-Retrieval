   Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy Measures Carbon in Soils in a Flash

   The U.S. Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists
   have developed a small, portable instrument that uses a laser to analyze the
   amount of carbon in soils, which can give scientists a better understanding
   of terrestrial processes that could accelerate or retard global warming. The
   new technology was highlighted in the November-December 2001 issue of the
   Journal of Environmental Quality.


   Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy Measures

      November 26, 2001With increasing international concern about
      greenhouse gases and global warming, scientists have sought better and
      more cost-effective approaches for measuring changes in the amount of
      land-based carbon, much of which is located in soils. But because the
      amount of carbon varies considerably from one spot to the next,
      measuring significant changes in land-based carbon in fields, ranch
      lands and forests is difficult.

      The newly developed Los Alamos technology will aid scientists as they
      try to determine how soil-based carbon is released into the air through
      natural or manmade causes, or whether atmospheric carbon is being
      absorbed into soils.

      "Carbon truly is the currency of life," said Los Alamos ecologist David
      Breshears, a co-author of the paper. "For years, scientists have sought
      to improve accounting of Earth's carbon budget. This instrument will
      help us improve that accounting and our understanding of how soil
      carbon responds to different types of land management."

   A New Way to Visualize Cells and Nuclei

   The U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Life
   Sciences and Computing Sciences divisions have joined forces to apply new
   biological and computational methods to mark and detect the boundaries of
   closely packed cells and nuclei crowded together under the microscope.


   Cells and Nuclei

      November 5, 2001To learn how tissues develop and maintain their
      organizationand especially to learn what goes wrong when cancer
      strikesit's essential to study individual cells and their nuclei
      within tissues. The problem is that in real tissues, and in many cell
      cultures grown in the laboratory, cells are often tightly clustered;
      their boundaries and the borders of their nuclei are hard to
      distinguish.

      Now Carlos Ortiz de Solorzano of Berkeley Lab's Life Sciences Division
      and Ravi Malladi of the Lab's Computing Sciences Division, with their
      colleagues Sophie Lelièvre and Stephen Lockett, have joined forces to
      apply new biological and computational methods to mark and detect the
      boundaries of closely packed cells and nuclei crowded together under
      the microscope. Their methods work not only with the envelopes of
      nuclei but with the membranes of tightly clustered cells as well.
