                        Safe Shelters & Indoor Safety

What is a Safe Shelter?

     A house or other substantial building offers the best protection
     from lightning. In assessing the safety provided by a particular
     structure, it is more important to consider what happens if the
     structure gets struck by lightning, rather than whether the
     structure will be hit by lightning. For a shelter to provide
     protection from lightning, it must contain a mechanism for
     conducting the electrical current from the point of contact to the
     ground. These mechanisms may be on the outside of the structure, may
     be contained within the walls of the structure, or may be a
     combination of the two. On the outside, lightning can travel along
     the outer shell of the building or may follow metal gutters and
     downspouts to the ground. Inside a structure, lightning can follow
     conductors such as the electrical wiring, plumbing, and telephone
     lines to the ground.

Avoid Unsafe Shelters!

     Unless specifically designed to be lightning safe, small structures
     do little, if anything, to protect occupants from lightning. Many
     small open shelters on athletic fields, golf courses, parks,
     roadside picnic areas, schoolyards and elsewhere are designed to
     protect people from rain and sun, but not lightning. A shelter that
     does not contain plumbing or wiring throughout, or some other
     mechanism for grounding from the roof to ground is not safe. Small
     wooden, vinyl, or metal sheds offer little or no protection from
     lightning and should be avoided during thunderstorms.

How Lightning Enters a House or Building

     There are three main ways lightning enters homes and buildings: (1)
     a direct strike, (2) through wires or pipes that extend outside the
     structure, and (3) through the ground. Regardless of the method of
     entrance, once in a structure, the lightning can travel through the
     electrical, phone, plumbing, and radio/television reception systems.
     Lightning can also travel through any metal wires or bars in
     concrete walls or flooring.

Stay Safe While Inside

     Phone use is the leading cause of indoor lightning injuries in the
     United States. Lightning can travel long distances in both phone and
     electrical wires, particularly in rural areas. Stay away from
     windows and doors as these can provide the path for a direct strike
     to enter a home. Do not lie the concrete floor of a garage as it
     likely contains a wire mesh. In general, basements are a safe place
     to go during thunderstorms. However, there are some things to keep
     in mind. Avoid contact with concrete walls which may contain metal
     reinforcing bars. Avoid washers and dryers since they not only have
     contacts with the plumbing and electrical systems, but also contain
     an electrical path to the outside through the dryer vent.

Remember Your Pets

     You may want to consider the safety of your family pets during
     thunderstorms. Dog houses are not lightning-safe. Dogs that are
     chained to trees or chained to wire runners can easily fall victim
     to a lightning strike.

Protect Your Personal Property

     Lightning also causes significant damage to personal property each
     year. In addition to direct strikes, lightning generates electrical
     surges that can damage electronic equipment some distance from the
     actual strike. To the extent possible, unplug any appliances or
     electronic equipment from all conductors well before a thunderstorm
     threatens. This includes not only the electrical system, but also
     the reception system. If you plan to be away from your home when
     thunderstorms are possible, be sure to unplug unneeded equipment
     before you leave.

Summary of Lightning Safety Tips for Inside the Home

    1.

   Avoid contact with corded phones
    2.

   Avoid contact with electrical equipment or cords. If you plan to unplug
   any electronic equipment, do so well before the storm arrives.
    3.

   Avoid contact with plumbing. Do not wash your hands, do not take a
   shower, do not wash dishes, and do not do laundry.
    4.

   Stay away from windows and doors, and stay off porches.
    5.

   Do not lie on concrete floors and do not lean against concrete walls.
