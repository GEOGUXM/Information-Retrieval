   RELEASE: 01-108AR

   NASA SUPPORTS 200 HIGH SCHOOLS IN ROBOTICS COMPETITION

   NASA and its corporate partners will support robotics education for
   about 200 high schools next year by sponsoring teams that will
   participate in a national robotics competition.

   The NASA-sponsored teams will join hundreds of others in constructing
   robots that will compete in regional contests and a final, national
   competition in April 2002 at Walt Disney World's EPCOT Center, Orlando,
   Fla. Students at the competing schools will be challenged to design a
   robot that will complete a specified set of tasks within rules to be
   outlined next week.

   "Education is key to the success of our country, and this approach
   represents one of the most powerful ways to get students motivated,"
   said Mark Leon, project manager of the Robotics Education Project at
   NASA's Ames Research Center, in California's Silicon Valley. "Some of
   these students may go on to help NASA engage in bold new missions of
   exploration of our solar system. The idea here is to involve students
   in hands-on activities to turn them on to science and math."

   The robotics project will kick off Jan. 5, 2002 at the Verizon Center
   in Manchester, N.H., with a demonstration of the task for this year's
   regional and national competitions. Rules, goals and other details,
   such as the layout of the playing field, will be revealed during NASA
   TV's broadcast of the ceremony. Detailed requirements of the robotic
   games are carefully guarded until announced at the kickoff event.

   Following the ceremony, students and their advisors will have six weeks
   to design and construct remote-control robots, using identical kits of
   material.

   The annual nationwide robotics competition is conducted by the
   non-profit FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and
   Technology) organization in Manchester and sponsored by NASA and a
   number of corporations. Each year FIRST presents a game problem and
   identical parts kits to each team. The teams, composed of high school
   students and professional engineers and scientists, work together to
   construct their robots for the competition. The engineers come from
   NASA, private industry, other government agencies and universities.

   Students also will organize marketing, public relations, fund-raising
   and management groups to compete for the award-winning solution. Each
   year's competition is different, so returning teams always have a new
   challenge.

   NASA-sponsored teams will receive a total of about $1.5 million. Each
   school received a $5,000 credit toward registration fees, and about
   $1,000 for travel to the kickoff ceremony. The group of NASA-sponsored
   teams includes many from disadvantaged schools. For a complete list of
   the awards issued by NASA, see:

   details are included on the FIRST website at:

   FIRST was started in 1989 by inventor Dean Kamen to persuade American
   youth that engineering and technology are exciting fields. The annual
   robotics competition is patterned after Massachusetts Institute of
   Technology professor Woodie Flowers' engineering design course. NASA
   participation in the FIRST program is provided through the NASA Office
   of Space Science and is directed by Dave Lavery.
