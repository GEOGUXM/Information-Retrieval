       Searches for all keywords and stopwords in exact order and
       position.
   contains in order

       test operator is for short text fields only.)

   Search Examples

   Searching multiple fields:
   Choose appropriate field connector from droplist box at the bottom of
   the search form.

   Sort Options:
   You may sort your search results by any of the fields in the droplist
   box at the bottom of the search form. You may also sort them in either
   ascending or descending order. If you select $RANK as the sort
   criterion, then the documents will be sorted according to how many hits
   were found in each. (A hit is a term in the document that matches the
   search value you specified.) If you keep the default value of NONE,
   then the documents will not be sorted.

   Note: When you specify $RANK for the Sort By box, the system will list
   the documents in descending order no matter what value you have
   selected in the Sort Order box.
