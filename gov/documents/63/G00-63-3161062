   CONTACT: Deborah Bortner FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE __360-902-8760 `Prime
   bank' scams on the rise, state securities regulators warn; Bogus
   schemes called `Crime of the Century' OLYMPIA (January 17, 2002)  With
   low interest rates and volatile equity markets causing Americans to
   rethink their investment strategies, Washington state's top securities
   regulator warned Thursday that losses from "prime bank" scams  over
   $1.5 billion last year, by one estimate  are rising dramatically.
   Securities Division Director Deborah Bortner says that the recession
   and volatile stock markets are making investing through the supposedly
   secretive portfolios of "prime banks" more appealing to investors.
   Promoters claim that prime bank trading programs can yield huge returns
   with no risk. "People want to believe there are secret ways to make
   fabulous amounts of money," said Bortner. "But there are no shortcuts
   in investing. Simply put, prime banks don't exist." In a typical pitch,
   increasingly made over the Internet, investors are promised access to
   secret, high-yield investments made through trades among the world's
   top or "prime" banks. So many prime bank scams succeed that the
   Commercial Crime Bureau of the International Chamber of Commerce calls
   them the "fraud of the century." Over the past three years, state
   regulators have brought actions on behalf of more than 41,000 people
   nationwide who invested at least $470 million in prime bank scams.
   During that time, regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission
   have shut down roughly three dozen prime bank scams, with losses
   totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. Promoters often used investor
   funds to lead lavish lifestyles. For example, promoters for Tri-West
   Investment Club, a $50 million prime bank scam shut down jointly by
   West Virginia, Washington, British Columbia and federal regulators,
   used investor funds to buy expensive homes, a helicopter, a yacht and
   luxury automobiles, including 10 antique cars. Bortner says that
   recently, the Securities Division entered a Final Order to Cease and
   Desist against Dennis Eugene Kluver of Spokane in connection with the
   Tri- West scheme. "Between July 2000 and April 2001," Bortner says,
   "Kluver allegedly solicited at least 41 persons to invest at least
   $195,000 in fictitious securities. Over that same time period, we
   believe he received at least $65,000 from Tri-West in "interest
   payments" and "recruiting fees" for his solicitations. The payments
   were represented as coming from the profits of the prime bank
   instrument trading," she explains, "when in fact they consisted of the
   funds of other investors." Bortner warns that con artists use a lot of
   financial jargon and appear financially sophisticated. "The investors
   don't question them because they don't want to appear Page 2 na√Øve. But
   there are no dumb questions when it comes to your money. If it sounds
   too good to be true, it probably is," she adds. One reason prime bank
   scam artists are able to mislead people is because the instruments they
   claim to be using  standby letters of credit, bank debentures and
   bank-secured trading programs, to name a few  mimic legitimate
   financial instruments closely enough to deceive people outside the
   specialized world of international banking. "The explosive growth of
   prime bank fraud is tied to the innovations we've seen in finance over
   the past 20 years," says Bortner. "The con artist invents
   great-sounding but phony investment products that sound similar to the
   hundreds of new, legitimate products. Investors too often let visions
   of above-market returns cloud their judgment," she points out. "When
   the big returns fail to happen, con artists often promise even higher
   returns 1,000 percent annually or more  to persuade their victims to
   "reinvest. "In prime bank schemes like these, investors should ask
   themselves `Why me?'" said Bortner. "If this scheme really works, why
   is some stranger in a hotel meeting room or on the telephone or the
   Internet offering to cut me in on it? Prime bank trading programs don't
   pass the smell test." Before making any investment, investors should
   ask the following questions: Has the seller given you written
   information that fully explains the investment? Make sure you get
   proper written information, such as a prospectus or offering circular,
   before you buy. The documentation should contain clear and accurate
   information to allow you or your financial adviser to evaluate and
   verify the particulars of the investment. Watch for jargon that sounds
   sophisticated but makes no sense. Are claims made for the investment
   realistic? Some things really are too good to be true. Use common sense
   and get a professional, third-party opinion when presented with
   investment opportunities that seem to offer unusually high returns in
   comparison to other investment options. Pie-in-the-sky promises often
   signal investment fraud. Does the investment meet your personal
   investment goals? Whether you are investing for long-term growth,
   investment income or other reasons, an investment should match your own
   investment goals. Are the seller and the investment licensed and
   registered in Washington? To check them out or get information on
