                   2000 ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE REPORTED FOR
                             CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS

               SACRAMENTO-"Today marks the beginning of the second year
     for California's comprehensive accountability system for public
     schools," State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin
     said as she released the 2000 Academic Performance Index (API)
     reports for public schools throughout the state.

               "The release is much more than the beginning of the API
     reporting cycle for 2001," Eastin said. "It is a result of hard work
     from educators, parents, community and business leaders, and elected
     officials throughout the state to build an accountability system. We
     have come a long way in a very short time."

               The API is the cornerstone of the Public Schools
     Accountability Act (PSAA-Senate Bill 1X), a Governor Gray
     Davis-sponsored bill signed into law in April 1999. This law
     authorized the establishment of the first statewide accountability
     system for California public schools. The system includes three
     major components: the API, the Immediate
     Intervention/Underperforming Schools Program (II/USP), and the
     Governor's Performance Award (GPA) Program.

               The purpose of the API is to measure the academic
     performance and progress of schools. It is a numeric index that
     ranges from a low of 200 to a high of 1000. The 2000 API establishes
     this year's baseline for a school's academic performance and sets an
     annual target for growth. The state has set 800 as the API score
     that schools should strive to meet.

               Eastin noted that the statewide target of 800, adopted by
     the State Board of Education in November 1999, represents a high
     level of student performance. Approximately 17 percent of schools
     statewide have attained this score, up from 12 percent in 1999. "The
     2000 API results reset the baselines and growth target for our
     schools. In effect, each new reporting cycle provides a fresh
     beginning for every school," Eastin said. "What is important is
     that, wherever schools are on the API scale, they can and must show
     academic progress. This improvement in student achievement is the
     goal of our accountability system."

               The statewide median elementary school API score for 2000
     is 675, up from 629 in 1999. The median middle school API score is
     657, up from 633 in 1999; and the median high school API score is
     636, up from 620 in 1999. The median means that one half of the
     schools are at or above that number, and half are below.

               The API Internet reports for schools will be posted on the
     California Department of Education Web site at http://api.cde.ca.gov
     on January 17 by 10 a.m.

               Results of the Stanford 9 test, given in spring 2000 as
     part of the state's Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR)
     program, were used to calculate each school's API for 2000. In
     grades 2-8, the API measures student performance in mathematics,
     reading, language, and spelling. In grades 9-11, the API measures
     performance in mathematics, reading, language, history/social
     science, and science. Grades K, 1, and 12 are not tested.

               Two types of 2000 API reports are being posted, depending
     on the number of students participating in the STAR program at a
     school. Reports include the 2000 API base score, statewide and
     similar school rankings, and annual growth targets for elementary,
     middle, and comprehensive high schools that have 100 or more valid
     student scores from the Stanford 9 test. Reports for schools with
     fewer than 100 valid student scores (but more than 10) include only
     a 2000 API score marked with an asterisk. The asterisk indicates the
     greater statistical uncertainty of an API based on fewer than 100
     test scores. Small school API reports do not include statewide or
     similar school rankings or growth targets.

               Alternative accountability system models are currently
     under development for small schools (fewer than 100 valid scores),
     special education schools and centers, and alternative schools
     (continuation high schools and county-administered schools for
     high-risk student populations). Future eligibility for school awards
     or interventions programs is contingent upon legislative action,
     including the appropriation of funds for awards to schools in the
     alternative accountability system.

               The same methodology and indicators used to calculate the
     1999 API were used to calculate the 2000 API. The only change in
     calculating the 2000 API was the inclusion of Stanford 9 results for
     first-year students in high school districts if those students came
     from an elementary school district that normally feeds into that
     high school district.

               The 2000 API reports posted for schools with 100 or more
     valid scores feature two types of rankings for schools. First, those
     schools receive an API score between 200 and 1000; then these scores
     are ranked statewide in ten groups of equal size (deciles) from
     decile one (lowest) to decile ten (highest). Schools are separated
     by school category (elementary, middle, and high) and then ranked
     within a category. A second decile ranking (also from one to ten)
     compares each school's 2000 API scores to other schools with similar
     characteristics.

               Each school's 2000 Base API report, except for small
     schools, includes the 2000-2001 growth target and the target score
     for the year 2001. A school's annual growth target is 5 percent of
     the distance between the 2000 Base API and the statewide performance
     target of 800. Targets are reset each year, based on the Base API
     for the current year.

               In addition to rankings and targets for the schools as a
     whole, API scores and growth targets are reported for schools with
     significant ethnic and socio-economically disadvantaged subgroups.

               "California's accountability system requires that all
     numerically significant groups of students within a school grow
     academically. This requirement makes a strong statement that the
     achievement of all students in a school is important," Eastin said.
     "No student should be left behind."

               Schools must annually report their API rankings in their
     local School Accountability Reports Cards. Each school district's
     governing board must discuss these results at a regularly scheduled
     public meeting.

               The second half of the API reporting cycle is scheduled
     for this fall. The school reports posted at that time will show how
     well schools and their subgroups achieve their targets based on
     growth from the 2000 API.

               The California Department of Education (CDE) plans to add
     other indicators of a school's academic performance to the API as
     soon as they are available. These indicators are scheduled to
     include results of the California Standards Tests that are aligned
     to state-adopted content standards. It is anticipated that results
     from the California Standards Test for English-Language Arts will be
     added as an indicator for calculating a school's Base API in 2001.
     Other indicators scheduled to be included in the future are a high
     school exit exam, and graduation and attendance rates. The law
     requires that test results make up at least 60 percent of the API.

               "We will add other data to the API when we feel confident
     that the information used is accurate, valid, and reliable," Eastin
     said.
