                Landsat TM Satellite Image Mosaic of the Southwestern U.S.
                                                                         &
                               Capturing Dust Storms with Digital Cameras!

   Wind-induced emission of dust from the land surface is a process of
   degradation: depleting fine-grained minerals critical for optimum
   vegetation growth, creating potentially hazardous air quality to humans
   on a local and regional scale, and adversely affecting climate on a
   regional and world-wide scale. The continued predictions of increasing
   concentrations in greenhouse gases also include predictions of
   increased aridification of continental interiors and the likelihood of
   enhanced dust emission. At this stage it is not understood how regional
   and global climate change will affect dust emissions and, in turn, how
   dust emission will affect the climate.

   At this web site we display some of our evolving work related to the
   use of remotely sensed satellite images to detect and study
   climate-induced and man-caused dust storms and vegetation change in the
   southwestern United States. We are currently using satellite-image data
   to detect and map active dust sources and sites of vegetation change.
   Ultimately we will focus our effort to provide a regional-scale
   database into which measurements of:
    1. meteorlogical parameters,
    2. sand- and dust-emission, and
    3. vegetation change.

   These data are acquired at local, highly instrumented sites may be used
   to develop and validated a dust-emission/vegetation change algorithm
   that can be used in a regional-scale, numerical, climate-prediction
   model. The intended results are:
    1. more accurate predictions of the consequences and magnitudes of
       expected climate change in the southwestern United States, and
    2. possible transfer of the algorithms and procedures to other arid
       areas of the world.

     Project Objective [Top]
     __________________________________________________________________

   The initial phase of this project is to investigate the use of
   satellite image data and their potential to detect active dust storms
   and/or detect and map areas vulnerable to eolian erosion. The satellite
   image data being investigated include those from GOES, Landsat MSS,
   Landsat TM, WiFS, and SeaWiFS. Below (under the Image Data heading) is
   a table showing the spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions of the
   various data sets and clickable thumbnail images linked to examples of
   some of our image results generated using data from that particular
   sensor.

     * Mapping Eolian Erosion Vulnerability
       Many parameters influence the amount of wind erosion that occurs,
       however, several are critical in the eolian process. Two of these
       critical parameters are the percent of vegetation cover and the
       type of surface soils. Using satellite digital multispectral data a
       simple model has been developed that allows an image to be
       generated that emphasizes areas with low vegetation density and
       high reflectance soils. Generally, this automatically highlights
       two of the important eolian erosion parameters (i.e., amount of
       vegetation cover/density and general surface soil type). Using this
       algorithm, an image can be generated that shows areas where these
       two conditions occur simultaneously. The red and near-infrared
       spectral bands, along with their ratio, are used in the algorithm.
       In this first-order eolian erosion vulnerability image map, various
       shades of yellow indicate different levels of low vegetation
       density and high reflectance soils, and serve as a guide to the
       relative level of erosion potential/ vulnerability to wind, and can
       be used to generate an Eolian Mapping Index (EMI) value at each
       pixel. In general, both the Landsat TM and WiFS image products
       shown on this webpage yellows have a higher eolian erosion
       potential, with the non-yellows having little or no wind erosion
       potential. The WiFS image data saturated in the brightest parts of
       many dry lake beds, so the resulting vulnerability image maps have
       anomalously bright yellow areas. These areas should be yellow, but
       not as bright as shown in the images. Part of the project in the
       future will include the radiometric calibration of the WiFS data to
       the Landsat TM so that resulting eolian erosion vulnerability image
       maps are comparable.
