      Artwork of future spacecraft travelling at warp speeds by artist Les

   To say that space is a big place doesn't begin to do it justice!
   Combine that with the limited life span of human beings and we learn
   pretty quickly that what we know today will not take us to the stars
   anytime soon! As magnificent as they are, chemical rockets are
   incapable of taking us on a round trip to even the nearest stars in a
   human lifetime. To become true star voyagers, we must expand our
   knowledge into new areas of science that offer new possibilities and
   opportunities. Just as Galileo, Copernicus and Newton did centuries
   ago, and Einstein, Hubble, Bohr, and others did in the 20th century, we
   must find the new science to take us where we want to go. We don't know
   the answer. But we know the question: How can we travel to the stars
   and retun in a human lifetime? Science @ NASA brings you stories about
   NASA research to answer that question.


                           beyond rocketry stories

   Fantastic Voyage Voyage of the Nano-Surgeons - January 15 :
   the cutting edge
   NASA-funded scientists are crafting microscopic vessels that can
   venture into the human body and repair problems, one cell at a time.

   bird Buck Rogers, Watch Out! - March 01 :
   the cutting edge
   NASA researchers are studying insects and birds, and using smart
   materials with uncanny properties to develop mindboggling new aircraft
   designs.

   M2P2 magnetic bubble Hitching a Ride on a Magnetic Bubble - October 04
   :
   space transportation
   NASA-funded scientists are experimenting with miniature magnetospheres
   as an innovative means of space transportation. If the group succeeds,
   next-generation spacecraft may come equipped with fuel-efficient
   magnetic bubbles that speed their occupants from planet to planet and
   ward off the worst solar flares.

   space elevator Audacious & Outrageous: Space Elevators - September 07 :
   space transportation
   Science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke was once asked when the "space
   elevator," a notion he helped to popularize, would become a reality.
   Clarke answered, "Probably about 50 years after everybody quits
   laughing." Nowadays NASA scientists are taking the idea seriously.
