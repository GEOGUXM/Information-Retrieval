   BILL CLANCEY AND MAARTEN SIERHIUS PRESENTATION AT NATO CONFERENCE
   Bill Clancey (Code IC) and Maarten Sierhuis (RIACS) attended the NATO
   Future Modeling and Simulation Challenges Conference, November 12-14,
   2001. The meeting was held at the Royal Military Academy in Breda,
   Netherlands. Clancey presented the joint paper "Multiagent Work
   Practice Simulation: Progress and Challenges" to an enthusiastic
   audience representing fifteen countries.
   This was the third meeting organized by the NATO M&S Group, part of the
   Research and Technology Organisation (RTO). Most of the briefings
   summarized the member country's modeling and simulation programs. Ms.
   McGlynn (Office of the Deputy for Under Secretary of Defense Operations
   Research) spoke for the US. The emphasis throughout the conference was
   strongly on military battlefield training using graphic displays of
   terrain and armaments. The chief technical problem is the
   interoperability of simulations developed by different countries, hence
   NMSG promotes high-level architectures and standards.
   The Clancey and Sierhuis presentation related well to the research of
   the participating universities and institutes (e.g., Chiva's MASA Group
   in Paris). Their briefing showed how an integrated simulation of
   people, technology, and facilities can be used to design future mission
   operations, using as an example the Victoria Lunar Rover simulation
   developed by Sierhuis and Mike Sims (Code IC).
