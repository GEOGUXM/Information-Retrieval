   The Space Project Mission Operations Control Architecture (SuperMOCA)
   is a NASA-sponsored task aimed at developing an architecture and a set
   of technologies and associated open system specifications for the
   monitor and control of remote space vehicles and supporting remote
   ground networks.

   The SuperMOCA task is being carried out by NASA in cooperation with
   DoD, commercial space operators, academia, and the U.S industrial base
   of space mission project suppliers. The forum for the cooperation for
   this effort is the
   Spacecraft Control Working Group (SCWG).
