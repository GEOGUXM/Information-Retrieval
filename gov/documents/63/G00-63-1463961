   Special Agent

   Special Agents come from a broad range of backgrounds and professions,
   but what they all have in common is a desire to fight crime and pursue
   a meaningful and rewarding career. To qualify for training as an FBI
   Special Agent, you must be a citizen of the U.S. or of the Northern
   Mariana Islands, and be between 23 and 36 years of age. Candidates must
   be available for assignment throughout the world, have uncorrected
   vision not worse than 20/200 (Snellen) and corrected 20/20 in one eye
   and not worse than 20/40 in the other. Candidates must pass color
   vision and hearing tests. Candidates must be in excellent physical
   condition.

   Applicants must possess a four-year degree from a college or university
   accredited by one of the regional or national accrediting associations
   recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education.

   There are four entry programs: Law, Accounting, Language, and
