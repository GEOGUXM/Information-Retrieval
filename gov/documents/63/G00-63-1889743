   Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus 2001 Edition Alan R. Aronson May 9,
   2001 1. Introduction The UMLS® Metathesaurus® denotes explicit
   ambiguity by appending an ambiguity designator, a number in angle
   brackets, to the end of an ambiguous string. Because strings with
   ambiguity des- ignators require significant special processing, the
   original string (with possible case changes) is always included as
   another string for the concept involved.1 Thus each concept with a
   string `aaa ' also has string `aaa' (ignoring case differences). But
   now any application which gains access to the Metathesaurus textually,
   cannot tell the difference among the concepts of an ambiguous cluster
   `aaa ' each of which is represented by `aaa'. The purpose of this
   report is to examine ambiguity in the 2001 release of the Metathesaurus
   in the context of its effect on natural language processing (NLP)
   applications. The number of explicitly ambiguous Metathesaurus terms in
   the 2001 edition has grown signifi- cantly over the 2000 edition. Table
   1 shows several counts that indicate that growth in broad 1999 2000
   2001 Strings with an ambiguity designator 7,912 9,416 (+19%) 12,840
   (+36%) Concepts with one or more ambiguity 6,565 7,409 (+13%) 9,637

   Measures of ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus terms. Some examples
   will clarify the meaning of the counts. There are 55 Metathesaurus
   strings `Other ' for n ranging from 1 to 55; these strings occur in 55
   distinct concepts but represent a single case of ambiguity. Some
   concepts contain more than one ambiguous string, i.e. they are
   ambiguous in more than one way. In fact, the concept `Optic Nerve
   Glioma, Childhood' has 37 ambiguous strings. A more manageable example
   of a concept with multiple ambiguities is `Arthrogryposis' which has
   the following six ambiguous strings: 1. This year there are some
   exceptions to this rule: the strings `Antitussive <2>',
   `Antigonadotrophins, antiestro- gens, antiandrogens, not elsewhere
   classified <1>' and `Other psychotropic drugs, not elsewhere classified
   <1>' have no corresponding string without the ambiguity designator. 1
   1. Introduction Amyoplasia congenita <1> Congenital Arthromyodysplasia
   <1> Congenital multiple arthrogryposis <1> myodystrophia fetalis
   deformans <2> myodystrophia foetalis deformans <2> pterygium universale
   <2> All but the last string are ambiguous with the concept `Amyoplasia
   congenita disruptive sequence'. The concept containing `pterygium
   universale <1>', however, is `Multiple pterygium syndrome'. The
   information in Table 1 shows that the amount of ambiguity in the
   Metathesaurus increased by about 30% from 2000 to 2001. Examining the
   cases of ambiguity more closely, consider the degree of ambiguity,
   i.e., the number of ways a string is ambiguous, or the number of
   concepts in which it occurs. `Other ', for example, has degree 55.
   Table 2 contains the distribution of Degree of ambiguity 1999 cases

   (+19%) 5,571 (+28%) Table 2. Metathesaurus ambiguity distribution by
   degree ambiguities in the Metathesaurus according to degree. Note that
   an ambiguity of degree one is not actually an ambiguity. `Abbreviations
   <1>', for example, is not ambiguous since there are no other
   `Abbreviations ' strings in the Metathesaurus. The most important thing
   to note about the table is that, with the exception of degree 17 cases,
   changes in ambiguity are focused on ambi- guities of degree six or less
   and mainly of degree two. The sixty new cases of ambiguity of degree 17
   would be problematic except for the fact that most of them are
   suppressible synonyms. So for 2001 there is effectively no
   proliferation of the problematic ambiguity of high degree. Table 3
   shows the ambiguity distribution after excluding suppressible synonyms.

   Section 2 of this report reviews the higher degree (5 or more)
   ambiguity cases; section 3 summa- rizes section 2; section 4 focuses on
   the cases of ambiguity of lesser degree (4 and 3 but not 2); section 5
   contains additional ambiguities discovered while preparing for MetaMap
   suppression; and section 6 contains a final summary of the results and
   recommendations for handling ambigu- ity in the Metathesaurus. 2.
   Higher Degree Ambiguity The most ambiguous English Metathesaurus
   strings are listed below in decreasing order of degree of ambiguity.
   Bold text indicates a difference between the 2000 and 2001
   Metathesaurus. Expla- nations for all cases of degree 5 or more are
   given below; in addition, the reader is referred to pre- vious editions
   for other explanations. * 55 `Other ' (was 54) * 23 `Protocols ' * 18
   `Patient Education Plans ' * 17 `Administrative procedure ' ... (Except
   for `Assessment ', there are a total of 59 cases of ambiguity of degree
   17; all are new, and their ambiguous forms are marked as suppressible.
   See section 2.4 below for an example, and see the appendix for the
   complete list.) Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2001 Edition) 3 2.

   string is `Other <55>' for concept `Miscellaneous Dietary Supple-
   ments'. Besides the legitimate concept `Other', the five cases of
   unsuppressed ambiguity are for concepts 1. `Other location of
   complaint' (<2>) 2. `Other activities involving preparation of a
   routine non-injectable drug product' (<52>) Ambiguity in the UMLS
   Metathesaurus (2001 Edition) 4 2. Higher Degree Ambiguity 3. `Other
   activities involving preparation of compounded non-parenteral
   medications' (<53>) 4. `Other activities involving preparation of
   compounded parenteral medications' (<54>) 5. `Miscellaneous Dietary
   Supplements' (<55>) These should all be marked as suppressible
   synonyms. 2.2 `Protocols ' All 23 strings `Protocols ' are
   generalizations of their preferred names and should be marked as
   suppressible. Their concepts are 1. `Protocols documentation' 2.
   `Protocols: Activities' 3. `Protocols: Bowel Elimination' 4.
   `Protocols: Circulation' 5. `Protocols: Cognition' 6. `Protocols:
   Coping' 7. `Protocols: Fluid and Electrolyte' 8. `Protocols: Health
   Behavior' 9. `Protocols: Immunology' 10. `Protocols: Medications and
   Blood Products' 11. `Protocols: Metabolism' 12. `Protocols: Nutrition'

   21. `Protocols: Tissue Integrity' 22. `Protocols: Tissue Perfusion' 23.
   `Protocols: Urinary Elimination' 2.3 `Patient Education Plans ' All 18
   strings `Patient Education Plans ' are generalizations and should be
   suppressed. Their concepts are 1. `Patient Education Plans: Activities'
   2. `Patient Education Plans: Bowel Elimination' 3. `Patient Education
   Plans: Circulation' 4. `Patient Education Plans: Coping' 5. `Patient
   Education Plans: Health Behavior' 6. `Patient Education Plans:
   Immunology' 7. `Patient Education Plans: Medications and Blood
   Products' 8. `Patient Education Plans: Metabolism' 9. `Patient
   Education Plans: Nutrition' Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2001
   Edition) 5 2. Higher Degree Ambiguity 10. `Patient Education Plans:
   Physical Regulation' 11. `Patient Education Plans: Pre- or Intra- or
   Post-Procedure' 12. `Patient Education Plans: Respiration' 13. `Patient
   Education Plans: Role Relationship' 14. `Patient Education Plans:
   Safety' 15. `Patient Education Plans: Self-Care' 16. `Patient Education
   Plans: Sensation, Pain and Comfort' 17. `Patient Education Plans:
   Tissue Integrity' 18. `Patient Education Plans: Urinary Elimination'
   2.4 `Administrative procedure ' The concepts associated with the 17
   senses of `Administrative procedure' are 1. `Administrative procedure'
   2. `Administrative procedure, BLOOD/BLOOD FORMING ORGANS/IMMUNE MECHA-
   NISM' 3. `Administrative procedure, CIRCULATORY' 4. `Administrative
   procedure, DIGESTIVE' 5. `Administrative procedure, EAR' 6.
   `Administrative procedure, ENDOCRINE/METABOLIC/NUTRITIONAL' 7.
   `Administrative procedure, EYE' 8. `Administrative procedure, FEMALE
   GENITAL SYSTEM INCLUDING BREAST' 9. `Administrative procedure, MALE
   GENITAL SYSTEM INCLUDING BREAST' 10. `Administrative procedure,
   MUSCULOSKELETAL' 11. `Administrative procedure, NEUROLOGICAL' 12.
   `Administrative procedure, PREGNANCY, CHILDBEARING, FAMILY PLANNING'
   13. `Administrative procedure, PSYCHOLOGICAL' 14. `Administrative
   procedure, RESPIRATORY' 15. `Administrative procedure, SKIN' 16.
   `Administrative procedure, SOCIAL PROBLEMS' 17. `Administrative
   procedure, URINARY SYSTEM' The first concept, simply `Administrative
   procedure', occurs in sources ICPC2E, ICPC93, SNMI98 and RCD99. The
   remaining concepts only occur in ICPC2E, and their ambiguous forms are
   already marked as suppressible. 2.5 `Assessment ' The concepts
   associated with the 16 senses of `Assessment' are 1. `Assessment: Bowel
   Elimination' 2. `Assessment: Circulation' 3. `Assessment: Cognition' 4.
   `Assessment: Coping' 5. `Assessment: Fluid and Electrolytes' 6.
   `Assessment: Health Behavior' 7. `Assessment: Medications and Blood
   Products' 8. `Assessment: Metabolism' 9. `Assessment: Pre- or Intra- or
   Post-Procedure' Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2001 Edition) 6 2.
   Higher Degree Ambiguity 10. `Assessment: Respiration' 11. `Assessment:
   Safety' 12. `Assessment: Self-Care' 13. `Assessment: Sensation, Pain
   and Comfort' 14. `Assessment: Urinary Elimination' 15. `Knowledge
   acquisition using a method of assessment' 16. `Nutrition Assessment'
   `Assessment ' is of degree 16, but this year the string `Assessment
   <17>' has been added to the concept, `Assessment: Cognition', which
   already has string `Assessment <5>'. The concepts occur in eight
   sources including PCDS97, MSH2001, PSY97 and ICPC2P. All of the
   ambiguous forms should be marked as suppressible. 2.6 `Limited
   function/disability ' All ambiguous forms for the 16 `Limited
   function/disability ' concepts are already marked as suppressible. 2.7
   `cde genotype ' The 8 strings `cde genotype ' differ only in the case
   of `c', `d' or `e'. They seem to be legiti- mate concepts from RCD99.
   In a case sensitive environment, there is no ambiguity; the presence of
   strings with ambiguity designators, although not harmful, is not
   necessary. When case is ignored, the ambiguity exists and the
   additional strings are warranted (albeit possibly confusing because
   they appear with mixed case). Thus, the ambiguous forms are correctly
   not suppressed. 2.8 `Driver injured in collision with other and
   unspecified motor vehicles in nontraffic accident ' and other cases The
   8 strings `Driver injured ... ' occur in RCD99 and ICD10 with some
   variation in the wording. The concepts for these strings are 1. `Bus
   driver injured in collision with other and unspecified motor vehicles
   in nontraffic accident' 2. `Car driver injured in collision with other
   and unspecified motor vehicles in nontraffic accident' 3. `Driver
   injured in collision with other and unspecified motor vehicles in
   nontraffic accident' 4. `Driver of three-wheeled motor vehicle injured
   in collision with other and unspecified motor vehicles in nontraffic
   accident' 5. `Driver pedal cycle injured in collision with other and
   unspecified motor vehicles in non- traffic accident' 6. `Heavy
   transport vehicle driver injured in collision with other and
   unspecified motor vehicles in nontraffic accident' 7. `Motorcycle
   driver injured in collision with other and unspecified motor vehicles
   in non- traffic accident' 8. `Pick-up truck or van driver injured in
   collision with other and unspecified motor vehi- cles in nontraffic
   accident' Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2001 Edition) 7 2.
   Higher Degree Ambiguity Except for the third case, the ambiguous
   strings are generalizations and should be suppressed. (Note that it
   does no harm to suppress all ambiguous forms because the third case is
   the preferred form for its concept; these are normally not suppressed
   by MetaMap.) Similar analyses apply to * `Driver injured in collision
   with other and unspecified motor vehicles in traffic accident ' *
   `Passenger injured in collision with other and unspecified motor
   vehicles in nontraffic accident ' * `Passenger injured in collision
   with other and unspecified motor vehicles in traffic acci- dent ' i.e.,
   all ambiguous forms should be suppressed. 2.9 `Cold ' The concepts
   associated with the six senses of `Cold' are * `Chronic Obstructive
   Airway Disease' (which has strings `COLD' and `Chronic Obstructive Lung
   Disease') (<3>) * `Cold Sensation' (<5>) * `Cold Therapy' (<4>)
   [consider suppressing] * `Cold brand of
   chlorpheniramine-phenylpropanolamine' (<6>) * `Common Cold' (<2>) *
   `cold temperature' (<1>) Senses <3>, <4> and <6> are currently
   suppressed by MetaMap for mainly practical reasons (see 2000 Edition),
   The only sense that might be marked as suppressible in the
   Metathesaurus is sense <4>, `Cold Therapy', and even that sense has
   been found in MEDLINE citations. 2.10 `Other injuries ' All ambiguous
   forms for the 6 `Other injuries' concepts are marked as suppressible.
   The concepts are * `Other auditory injuries' * `Other digestive system
   injuries' * `Other hematologic injuries' * `Other neurologic injuries'
   * `Other ocular injuries' * `Other respiratory injuries' 2.11 `Stomach
   ' and other cases The concepts associated with the 6 senses of
   `Stomach' are * `Benign neoplasm of stomach' (<3>) * `Carcinoma in situ
   of stomach' (<2>) * `Neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behavior of
   stomach' (<4>) * `Procedures on the stomach' (<6>) Ambiguity in the
   UMLS Metathesaurus (2001 Edition) 8 2. Higher Degree Ambiguity *
   `Stomach' (<1>) * `Stomach problem' (<5>) The new sense for 2001 is
   `Procedures on the Stomach' and represents a systematic introduction of
   ambiguity arising from ICD10AM, i.e., many body parts exhibit the same
   ambiguity. Only the concept `Stomach', itself, is a legitimate sense of
   the word stomach. Except for the new sense, the ambiguous forms for the
   other concepts are already marked as suppressible. Those for `Proce-
   dures on the stomach' should also be so marked. The concepts for the 6
   senses of `urethra' are * `Benign neoplasm of urethra' (<3>) *
   `Malignant neoplasm of urethra' (<2>) * `Neoplasm of uncertain or
   unknown behavior of urethra' * `Procedures on Urethra' (<6>) *
   `Urethra' (<1>) * `Urethral Diseases' (<5>) Sense <6> is new, only
   sense <1> is legitimate, senses <2> through <4> have already been
   marked as suppressible, and senses <5> and <6> should also be marked as
   suppressible. The concepts for the 5 senses of `Appendix' are *
   `Appendix' (<1>) * `Benign neoplasm of appendix' (<4>) * `Malignant
   neoplasm of appendix' (<3>) * `Neoplasm of uncertain or unknown
   behavior of appendix' (<2>) * `Procedures on Appendix' (<5>) Sense <5>
   is new, only sense <1> is legitimate, senses <2> through <4> have
   already been marked as suppressible, and sense <5> should also be
   marked as suppressible. The concepts for the 5 senses of `Bladder' are
   * `Benign neoplasm of bladder' (<3>) * `Bladder' (<1>) * `Carcinoma in
   situ of bladder' (<2>) * `Neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behavior of
   bladder' (<4>) * `Procedures on bladder' (<5>) This case is identical
   to `Appendix': sense <5> should be marked as suppressible. The concepts
   for the 5 senses of `conjunctiva' are * `Benign neoplasm of
   conjunctiva' (<3>) * `Conjunctival Diseases' (<4>) * `Malignant
   neoplasm of conjunctiva' (<2>) * `Procedures on conjunctiva' (<5>) *
   `conjunctiva' (<1>) Sense <1> is the only legitimate sense, senses <2>
   and <3> are already marked as suppressible, and senses <4> and <5>
   should also be marked as suppressible. Ambiguity in the UMLS
   Metathesaurus (2001 Edition) 9 2. Higher Degree Ambiguity The concepts
   for the 5 senses of `Esophagus' are * `Benign neoplasm of esophagus'
   (<3>) * `Carcinoma in situ of esophagus' (<2>) * `Esophagus' (<1>) *
   `Esophagus problem' (<4>) * `Procedures on the esophagus' (<5>) Sense
   <1> is legitimate, senses <2> through <4> are already marked as
   suppressible, and sense <5> should also be marked as suppressible. The
   concepts for the 5 senses of `Kidney' are * `Benign neoplasm of kidney'
   (<2>) * `Kidney' (<1>) * `Kidney problem' (<4>) * `Neoplasm of
   uncertain or unknown behavior of kidney' (<3>) * `Procedures on Kidney'
   (<5>) Sense <1> is legitimate, senses <2> through <4> are already
   marked as suppressible, and sense <5> should also be marked as
   suppressible. The concepts for the 5 senses of `Larynx' are * `Benign
   neoplasm of larynx' (<2>) * `Carcinoma in situ of larynx' (<3>) *
   `Larynx' (<1>) * `Neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behavior of larynx'
   (<4>) * `Procedures on larynx' (<5>) Sense <1> is legitimate, senses
   <2> through <4> are already marked as suppressible, and sense <5>
   should also be marked as suppressible. The concepts for the 5 senses of
   `Liver' are * `Benign neoplasm of liver' (<2>) * `Liver' (<1>) * `Liver
   brand of Vitamin B 12' (<4>) * `Liver problem' (<3>) * `Procedures on
   liver' (<5>) Senses <1> and <4> are legitimate (although MetaMap
   suppresses <4>), senses <2> and <3> are already marked as suppressible,
   and sense <5> should also be marked as suppressible. The concepts for
   the 5 senses of `Pancreas' are * `Benign tumor of pancreas' (<2>) *
   `Pancreas' (<1>) * `Pancreas extract' (<3>) * `Pancreas problem' (<4>)
   * `Procedures on Pancreas' (<5>) Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus
   (2001 Edition) 10 2. Higher Degree Ambiguity Sense <1> is legitimate,
   senses <2> and <4> are already marked as suppressible, and senses <3>
   and <5> should also be marked as suppressible. Note that this case of
   body part ambiguity is dis- tinct because of the concept `Pancreas
   extract'. The concepts for the 5 senses of `Penis' are * `Benign tumor
   of penis' (<3>) * `Carcinoma in situ of penis' (<2>) * `Penile
   Diseases' (<4>) * `Procedures on Penis' (<5>) * `penis' (<1>) Sense <1>
   is legitimate, senses <2> and <4> are already marked as suppressible,
   and senses <3> and <5> should also be marked as suppressible. The
   concepts for the 5 senses of `Pineal Gland' are * `Benign neoplasm of
   pineal gland' (<3>) * `Malignant neoplasm of pineal gland' (<2>) *
   `Neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behavior of pineal gland' (<4>) *
   `Pineal gland' (<1>) * `Procedures on Pineal Gland' (<5>) Sense <1> is
   legitimate, senses <2> through <4> are already marked as suppressible,
   and sense <5> should also be marked as suppressible. The concepts for
   the 5 senses of `prostate' are * `Benign neoplasm of prostate' (<3>) *
   `Carcinoma in situ of prostate' (<2>) * `Neoplasm of uncertain or
   unknown behavior of prostate' (<4>) * `Prostate' (<1>) * `Prostatic
   Diseases' (<5>) Again, sense <1> is legitimate, senses <2> through <4>
   are already marked as suppressible, and sense <5> should also be marked
   as suppressible. The concepts for the 5 senses of `Rectum' are *
   `Benign neoplasm of rectum' (<3>) * `Carcinoma in situ of rectum' (<2>)
   * `Neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behavior of rectum' (<4>) *
   `Procedures on Rectum' (<5>) * `Rectum' (<1>) Yet again, sense <1> is
   legitimate, senses <2> through <4> are already marked as suppressible,
   and sense <5> should also be marked as suppressible. The concepts for
   the 5 senses of `Ureter' are * `Benign neoplasm of ureter' (<2>) *
   `Disorder of ureter' (<4>) * `Neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behavior
   of ureter' (<3>) Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2001 Edition) 11
   2. Higher Degree Ambiguity * `Procedures on Ureter' (<5>) * `Ureter'
   (<1>) Sense <1> is legitimate, senses <2> and <3> are already marked as
   suppressible, and senses <4> and <5> should also be marked as
   suppressible. The concepts for the 5 senses of `Vagina' are * `Benign
   neoplasm vagina' (<2>) * `Carcinoma in situ of vagina' (<3>) *
   `Procedures on Vagina' (<5>) * `Vagina' (<1>) * `Vaginal Diseases'
   (<4>) Again, sense <1> is legitimate, senses <2> and <3> are already
   marked as suppressible, and senses <4> and <5> should also be marked as
   suppressible. 2.12 `[SO] Premolar tooth ' and `Premolar tooth ' These
   two cases involve the same concepts with identical ambiguity
   designators: * `Bicuspid' (<1>) * `Permanent lower right second
   premolar tooth' (<5>) * `Permanent upper left first premolar tooth'
   (<4>) * `Permanent upper left second premolar tooth' (<3>) * `Permanent
   upper right first premolar tooth' (<2>) As observed in the 1999
   Edition, this is not a true case of ambiguity. The ambiguous forms for
   all senses should be marked as suppressible. 2.13 `adjustment ' The
   concepts for the 5 senses of `adjustment' are * `Adjustment -
   classification term' (<4>) * `Adjustment Action' (<3>) * `Clinical
   Adjustment' (<2>) * `Individual Adjustment' (<1>) * `Psychological
   adjustment' (<5>) Except for sense <4>, this is legitimate ambiguity.
   Sense <4> is self referential and should be marked as suppressible.
   2.14 `cd ' The concepts for the 5 senses of `cd' are * `CP protocol' *
   `Cadmium' * `Compact discs' * `Diagnosis, clinical' * `candela'
   Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2001 Edition) 12 2. Higher Degree
   Ambiguity This is legitimate ambiguity (although it is not clear why
   `CP protocol' is related to `cd'). How- ever, the ambiguous forms are
   suppressed in MetaMap because they are abbreviations. 2.15 `Cl ' The
   concepts for the 5 senses of `Cl' are * `Chloride Ion' * `Chloride
   measurement' * `Chlorine' * `Cycloleucine' * `centiliter' Like `cd',
   the senses are legitimate but are suppressed in MetaMap. 2.16 `Injuries
   ' The concepts for the 5 senses of `Injuries' are * `Female genital
   injuries' (<4>) * `Injury inflicted to the body by an external force'
   (<2>) * `Male Genital Injuries' (<5>) * `Physical trauma' (<1>) *
   `urologic injuries' (<3>) Senses <1> and <2> are legitimate (they may
   be synonymous) and the remaining senses are already marked as
   suppressible. 2.17 `P ' The concepts for the 5 senses of `P' are *

   tourniquet cuff inflation' (<3>) * `Manual tourniquet application'
   (<4>) * `Tourniquet cuff inflation' (<5>) * `Upper tourniquet cuff

   made ambiguous using the expression `Tourniquet on'. All senses should
   be marked as suppressible. Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2001
   Edition) 13 3. Summary of Higher Degree Ambiguity 3. Summary of Higher
   Degree Ambiguity This section summarizes the recommendations of the
   previous section to add new strings to the Metathesaurus or to mark
   some Metathesaurus strings as suppressible. 3.1 Missing strings for
   ambiguous concepts The following strings only occur with an ambiguity
   designator: * `Antitussive <2>' * `Antigonadotrophins, antiestrogens,
   antiandrogens, not elsewhere classified <1>' * `Other psychotropic
   drugs, not elsewhere classified <1>' Corresponding strings without it
   should be added to the appropriate concepts: * `Antitussive' *
   `Antigonadotrophins, antiestrogens, antiandrogens, not elsewhere
   classified' * `Other psychotropic drugs, not elsewhere classified' 3.2
   Strings which should be marked suppressible Some concepts have
   ambiguous forms which should be marked as suppressible, where ambiguous
   forms means a string with an ambiguity designator and one or more
   strings without it. Note that some concepts such as `Assessment:
   Cognition' have more than one ambiguous form with ambi- guity
   designator, `Assessment <5>' and `Assessment <17>' in this case. The
   concepts, sometimes followed by the relevant ambiguity number, are *
   `Other location of complaint' (<2>) * `Other activities involving
   preparation of a routine non-injectable drug product' (<52>) * `Other
   activities involving preparation of compounded non-parenteral

   considered in this section. Because of the large number of cases of
   such ambiguity (68 and 479, respectively), the section will be written
   over time and only those cases calling for some action will be
   reported. Ambiguous forms for concepts shown in bold should be marked
   as suppressible, and other recommendations specific to the
   Metathesaurus are also shown in bold. Recommendations for cases which
   are not clear are indicated with a question mark or by the word

   Conclusions The analysis in this and previous editions of this report
   reveals some classes of ambiguity com- monly occurring in the
   Metathesaurus: * Body part/disease ambiguity. This class of false
   ambiguity is exemplified by the string `Pros- tate' for `Prostatic
   Diseases'. It arises from terms which require context within their
   vocabulary in order to be properly understood. * Body part or medical
   device/procedure ambiguity. Similar to the above class, this class of
   false ambiguity is exemplified by `Stomach' and `Procedures on the
   stomach' or by `Prosthe- sis' and `Prosthesis Implantation'. This kind
   of ambiguity is not as clearly false ambiguity as the previous class. *
   Substance/measurement ambiguity. This class, exemplified by `Thyroid
   stimulating immuno- globulins' and `Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins
   assay', generally represents true ambi- guity, especially in patient
   records but also in the biomedical literature. Note that it is a non-
   trivial exercise to decide when the strings for a given concept should
   be split into two concepts. These first three cases of ambiguity
   represent a spectrum: concepts for the first class should be split;
   those for the last should not be split; and those for the middle class
   could probably be decided either way. * Generalization ambiguity. This
   is also false ambiguity caused by grouping several concepts together
   using a more general term. For example, 23 concepts including
   `Protocols documenta- tion' and `Protocols: Activities' are generalized
   to `Protocols'. * Abbreviation ambiguity. This is another, large class
   of ambiguity caused by distinct concepts having the same acronyms (or
   abbreviations). An example from above is that `Mitral Valve Stenosis',
   `Multiple Sclerosis', `Morphine Sulfate' and `millisecond' all have
   abbreviation `MS' or `ms'. Although this class represents true
   ambiguity in a strict sense, it is better to disal- low it in many text
   processing situations, especially those in which authors define the
   abbrevia- tions they use. Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2001
   Edition) 28 7. Appendix * Meta ambiguity. This new class of ambiguity,
   represented by strings such as `Other complica- tions of procedures NEC
   in ICD10', contain meta information. In this case it is the name of the
   vocabulary, ICD10 in the example. As opposed to the first class of
   ambiguity above in which strings such as `Prostate' meaning `Prostatic
   Diseases' do not say enough about themselves, these strings say too
   much. It is true that the meaning of a string containing `NEC', `not
   else- where classified' or like phrase, depends upon its vocabulary,
   but such information is already available in the MSRO file (where it
   belongs). It is also true that such strings have different meanings and
   strictly speaking should be different concepts. But the practical
   result of such a representational scheme is to introduce an ambiguity
   that most users do not want or need to resolve. (It is not even clear
   that those who do want to resolve the ambiguity can do so with the
   information available in the Metathesaurus.) Trying to decide what
   level of ambiguity is acceptable in some textual application is
   analogous to determining what granularity of meaning is appropriate in
   a knowledge source such as the Meta- thesaurus. Different levels are
   appropriate for different purposes. One reasonable way to divide
   responsibility for handling ambiguity is to * mark the following kinds
   of ambiguity as suppressible in the Metathesaurus: Body part/disease,
   Body part or medical device/procedure, Generalization, and Meta1
   ambiguity; * suppress Abbreviation ambiguity within MetaMap; and * do
   nothing for Substance/measurement ambiguity. One limitation of this
   study is that there is no follow-up of ambiguous strings discovered
   while examining the strings for a given case. For example, the set of
   all strings for the concepts contain- ing a `sound measurement ' string
   include the ambiguous strings `Ultrasonography ', `Echography ',
   `Ultrasound ', `Echotomography ' and `ultrasound scanning '. If the
   ambiguous forms for `sound measurement ' are to be marked as
   suppressible, how does that affect the other ambiguous strings. Each of
   them is part of a cluster of concepts, possibly dif- ferent from the
   one for `sound measurement '. Although it is probably not necessary to
   explore the new concept clusters, it is essential to examine the
   original cluster for additional ambiguous forms to suppress. Finally,
   the study ignores the almost 5,000 cases of ambiguity of degree 2.
   Manual examination of them would be very time-consuming. However, it
   would be worthwhile to search for patterns such as `Procedures on ...'
   or ` of ...' which occur frequently in ambiguity of higher degree in
   order to discover further strings to mark as suppressible. 7. Appendix
   7.1 List of Ambiguity Cases of Degree 17 The following 59 cases of
   ambiguity have degree 17 in the 2001 Metathesaurus. All are suppress-
   ible (except for a few appropriate cases as noted). 1. Consider
   completely removing meta ambiguity strings which mention a vocabulary,
   collapsing what are now the ambiguous forms for the concepts into a
   single concept. This would reinstate the previous way of han- dling
   such cases (i.e., by doing nothing). Ambiguity in the UMLS
