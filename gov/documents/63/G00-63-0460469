                                 Board Mission

   The General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals was
   established under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41 U.S.C. §§
   601-613, as an independent tribunal to hear and decide contract
   disputes between government contractors and the General Services
   Administration.  The Board also hears and decides disputes between
   contractors and other executive agencies of the United States,
   including the Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, and Education.

   The Board uses a variety of techniques intended to shorten and
   simplify, when appropriate, the formal proceedings normally used to
   resolve contract disputes.  The Board fully supports the use of
   alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in all appropriate cases; it
   encourages the prompt, expert, and inexpensive resolution of contract
   disputes as promoted by the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act.

   In addition, the Board provides to other executive agencies, on a
   reimbursable basis and by agreement of the parties, alternative dispute
   resolution services on contract-related matters, whether arising before
   or after a contract has been awarded.

   Finally, the Board hears and decides three additional classes of
   cases.  The Board decides claims by federal employees under 31 U.S.C. §
   3702 for reimbursement of expenses incurred while on official temporary
   duty travel or in connection with relocation to a new duty station,
   claims by carriers or freight forwarders under 31 U.S.C. § 3726(i)(1)
   involving rate determinations, and claims under 5 U.S.C. § 5564 for the
   proceeds of the sale of property of certain federal civilian employees
   who are dead, ill or missing.
