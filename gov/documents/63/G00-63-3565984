   HAZARDS OF RED IMPORTED FIRE ANTS!
   Updated: 01/29/02 4:00 p.m.
   TCWD is partnering with the Orange County Fire Ant Authority to notify
   the public to report fire ants they might suspect they have.
   Currently, fire ant reporting has decreased, but with springtime and
   warmer weather approaching, fire ants will begin their emergence from
   the soil. If you believe you have seen fire ants, please contact the
   State hotline number - 1 (888) 4 FIREANT. Or, you may link to the
   Orange County Fire Ant Authority (www.ocfireant.com) through TCWD's
   website.
