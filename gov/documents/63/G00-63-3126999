    _____________________________________________________________________

   California-Mexico Fellows Program In partnership with the Pacific
   Council on International Policy and the University of California
   Institute for Mexico and the United States (UC MEXUS), the Office of
   the Lieutenant Governor has created the California-Mexico Fellows
   Program. This program, governed by a bi-national Executive Board, will
   facilitate the training of an elite group of students to become the
   future bicultural leaders of the country of Mexico and the State of
   California.

   The California-Mexico Fellows Program will provide fellowships for
   Mexican post-graduate students to study at selected California
   universities, including Stanford, USC, the University of California and
   Cal Tech. Likewise, California post-graduates or college-graduating
   seniors will be selected to study at premiere Mexican universities and
   centers of higher learning and research, such as ITAM, Colegio de
   Mexico, Tecnologico de Monterrey, and UNAM).

   This program will provide academic and financial support for one to two
   years, extendable to a third year for students who wish to complete a
   degree. Support will include assistance in tuition and fees, health
   insurance, a living stipend, round-trip airfare, and a fund for
   educational materials.

   The fellows may be chosen from any field of study. Preference, however,
   will be given to those areas that lend themselves to the development of
   future leaders and that are fundamental to the relationship between
   Mexico and California: agriculture, business and commerce, law,
   political science, public health, and public policy.

   Along with the academic portion of the fellowship, the students will be
   provided the opportunity to engage in the public and private sectors
   through internships and meetings with civic, business and other
   professional leaders. In addition, the program will consist of
   extracurricular trips and events that will expose the fellows to the
   different regions of either Mexico or California. This portion of the
   program will allow the fellows to acquire a wide spectrum of the
   political, economic, social, and cultural environments within the two
   countries.

   The California-Mexico Fellows Program will provide California and
   Mexicos best and brightest young people with a rewarding academic and
   cultural experience. It will also provide both places with a pool of
   future leaders who truly understand and appreciate both California and
   Mexico.
