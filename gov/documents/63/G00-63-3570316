     MTD Board
     The MTD Board is made up of five directors. Two are appointed by the
     County Board of Supervisors and two are appointed by the Santa Barbara
     City Council. The fifth member, also known as the at-large director, is
     appointed by the other four members of the board. Currently the five
     serving directors have a combined wealth of transit experience which
     has proven to be a great benefit to MTD and the community of Santa
     Barbara.
