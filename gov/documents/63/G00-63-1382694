Visiting Marshall

   Are you planning on a visit to Huntsville, Alabama? If yes, this
   website is for you! In the heart of the Rocket City is one of NASA's
   largest installations, Marshall Space Flight Center. Here engineers and
   scientists are dedicated and committed to our mission of bringing space
   to people.
   We have agency-wide responsibilities in Space Propulsion, Microgravity,
   Space Optics, and Space Transportation. With these responsibilities,
   Marshall is excited to provide the general public an opportunity to
   visit our Official Visitor Center, the U.S. Space and Rocket Center and
   take a bus tour of Marshall. On the bus tour, you will see displays and
   exhibits about current research conducted at Marshall.
   Use the map of Marshall to help you become oriented with the research
   facilities. Take advantage of updated information about upcoming tour
   stops and how we plan to enhance existing tour stops.
