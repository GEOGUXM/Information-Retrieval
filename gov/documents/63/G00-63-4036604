   This document could not have been produced without the support of the
   U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant
   Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (DHHS/ASPE). Special thanks go to
   Jennifer Tolbert for her direction and encouragement.

   Thanks also go to the many state officials who participated in
   interviews and reviewed the draft:
     * Kimberly Davis Allen and Jacqueline Gray of Alabama
     * Maresa Corder of Florida
     * Dennis Janssen, Diana Kading, and Dann Stevens of Iowa
     * Deborah Blanchette, Katherine Levasseur, Brenda McCormick, and Gino
       Nalli of Maine

     * Nancy Austin, Charlene Benson, Melinda Jones, and Rebecca
       Pasternik-Ikard of Oklahoma
     * Jill Melton, Susan Milam, Dee Sportsman,and Cynthia Walker of the
       state of Texas, and Carla Barnes, Vicki Jones, Ann Prescott, and
       Sandy Tyler of Birch and Davis (the plan administrator for Texas'
       PCCM program)
     * Scott Cannady of Virginia

   Finally, the authors would like to thank the physicians who agreed to
   be interviewed for the report:
     * Roger Hofford, M.D., of Virginia
     * Burtt Richardson, M.D., of Maine

   We appreciate that these individuals took time from their very busy
   schedules in order to help us better understand their primary care case
   management programs. We salute them for their hard work in developing
   and administering these innovative programs.

                              Executive Summary

   Primary care case management (PCCM) is a system of managed care used by
   state Medicaid agencies in which a primary care provider is responsible
   for approving and monitoring the care of enrolled Medicaid
   beneficiaries, typically for a small monthly case management fee in
   addition to fee-for-service reimbursement for treatment. States began
   enrolling beneficiaries in their PCCM programs by the mid-1980s to
   increase access and reduce inappropriate emergency room and other high
   cost care. State use of PCCM grew steadily during the 1990s.

   In many ways, early PCCM programs were more like traditional
   fee-for-service Medicaid than their managed care counterpart,
   risk-based programs. Some states developed PCCM as a stepping stone to
   risk-based managed care, and therefore considered their MCO contracts
   as the predominant managed care system. That emphasis has been
   shifting, however, in those states that are experiencing a decrease in
   contractors as MCOs choose to exit Medicaid managed care.

   PCCM programs have evolved significantly over time. Each state has
   taken a slightly different approach, depending in part on the state's
   particular managed care environment. The eight states studied for this
   paper (Alabama, Florida, Iowa, Maine, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas,
   and Virginia) were chosen for the range of strategies used in their
   PCCM programs. What these states have in common is a desire for
   increased accountability among their provider networks, in order to
   ensure high quality care for Medicaid beneficiaries.

   As PCCM programs have matured, state goals have changed from simply
   expanding access to better management of the quality of care provided.
   To this end, case-study states are using strategies in managing their
   PCCM programs that are similar to network management principles used by
   MCOs. The case-study states are employing innovative strategies in the
   areas of:
     * Organizational structure and administration, such as use of a plan
       administrator to implement the state's policies and decisions
       (Texas), programs focusing on population management (North
       Carolina), and a demonstration project geared to Medicaid
       beneficiaries who are receiving long-term care services at home
       (Maine).

     * Provider recruitment and retention, including a greater focus on
       supporting participating providers through specially designated
       provider outreach staff (Alabama, Florida, Virginia, Texas),
       provider hotlines (Alabama, Iowa, Maine, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
       Texas, Virginia), feedback mechanisms such as provider profiling
       (Maine, Alabama, Texas), and strategies to gain providers' input
       and suggestions (nearly all case-study states).
     * Quality activities, such as disease management programs (Florida,
       North Carolina, Oklahoma), use of HEDIS or other measures to gauge
       PCP performance (Iowa, Maine, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas),
       individual and community health needs assessments (Maine, Texas),
       community-based preventive health educational campaigns (Maine,
       Texas), and nurse advice lines (Oklahoma, Texas).
     * Finance modifications, such as incentive payment systems (Maine,
       Oklahoma) and capitating primary/preventive services (Oklahoma).
     * Service management, such as care coordinators within PCP offices
       for people eligible to receive long-term care services at home
       (Maine) and health needs assessments (Maine, North Carolina).
     * Enrollment functions, such as targeted processes used to facilitate
       the enrollment of populations with special needs (Alabama,
       Oklahoma).
