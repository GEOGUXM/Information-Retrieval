   The Western New York Chapter of the American Meteorological Society is
   looking for new members.  You need not be a professional or an AMS
   member, but just have an interest in the weather and the desire to
   share that passion with other weather-minded folks.

    The Western New York Chapter, currently has about 20 members.  It has
    been in operation continuously since 1980 and schedules monthly
    meetings for fun. The meetings are held from October to May each
    season.  These meetings include field visits to the Buffalo National
    Weather Service, TV stations, Universities and Airport facilities.  A
    picnic is usually held to cap off the season in June.
