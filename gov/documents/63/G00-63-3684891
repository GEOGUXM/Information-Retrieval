   High Performance Table Lamp

   [updownpixsmall.JPG] LBNL's High Efficiency Table Lamp provides
                        an efficient light source both for task lighting
                        as well as ambient light.

Energy-Efficient Torchieres

     Several energy efficient torchieres have been designed and tested in
     the Fixtures Lab and many more are in development. Check out the
     latest in energy efficient torchieres for the home and office and
     learn about our design and testing process.

Hotel Lighting Demonstration Project

     A study was conducted in order to better understand the lighting
     usage and energy consumption patterns in typical hotel guestrooms.
     This involved a multi-phase research, development, and demonstration
     program.


   US Post Office: Task Lighting Project

                                                         [ Press Release ]

     A unique integrated lighting approach was applied to US Postal
     facilities: achieving significant energy savings while greatly
     improving lighting quality in the workplace.


Residential Downlights Scoping Study

     Through evaluating a sample of residential downlight models
     currently available in the market, this study explores the current
     state of downlight fixture performance.

        Historical Lighting
        Projects at LBNL:

     Fiber Optic Research

          Using fiber optic cable specifically made for lighting is a
          relatively new and exciting market in the lighting industry. The
          Fixtures Lab is developing efficient methods of illuminating fiber
          optic cable using high wattage, high efficacy sources.

   High-Efficiency Sulfur Lamp

        A unique bi-phase reflector was developed by the Fixtures Lab to
        distribute light from a 1000 Watt electrodeless sulfur lamp broadly
        and evenly throughout a large indoor space. This technology was
        demonstrated in the lobby of the Sacramento Muliciple Utility
        District's headquarters.
