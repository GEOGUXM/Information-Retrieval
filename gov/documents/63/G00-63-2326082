   Commercial Technology Division

      Quote from Agenda for Change The Commercial Technology Division at NASA
      Headquarters provides strategic direction and oversight for NASA's
      Commercial Technology Mission, which encompasses the NASA-wide
      implementation of the Commercial Technology program, the Small Business
      Innovative Research (SBIR) program, and associated technology
      commercialization initiatives and activities.

      In keeping with the Commercial Technology Mission and Policy and the
      NASA Strategic Plan, NASA seeks to foster private/public partnerships
      to develop technology for NASA missions and commercial purposes, and to
      facilitate the transfer and commercialization of NASA-funded research
      and technology. These efforts--building upon the agency's rich history
      of technology transfer and partnership with U.S. industry--serve to
      stimulate U.S. economic growth, strengthen the international
      competitiveness of U.S. industry, and improve the effectiveness of
      NASA's Strategic Enterprises.

      The Director of the Commercial Technology Division is Dr. Robert L.
      Norwood; this Division is under the auspices of the NASA's Office of
      Aeronautics and Space Transportation Technology. Please consult the
      NASA Commercial Technology Network for further information on how NASA
      is moving technology from the lab to the marketplace.
