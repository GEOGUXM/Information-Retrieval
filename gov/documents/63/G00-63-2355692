    OREA's mission is to protect public safety by continuously improving
     and promoting the integrity and professionalism of the real estate
             appraisal industry. OREA protects public safety by:
     * Investigating complaints against licensees and persons acting in a
       capacity that requires a license.
     * Investigating the background and conduct of applicants and
       licensees and
     * Investigating complaints against educational course providers.

     There are four types of investigations commonly conducted by OREA,
                 which are described in the following table:
