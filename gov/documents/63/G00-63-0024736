     Overview

     The NIAMS both supports and conducts medical research. The majority
     of our budget goes to fund researchers to undertake a wide spectrum
     of basic, clinical, epidemiologic, training and other programs in
     universities, medical schools, and academic health centers - known
     as "extramural" research. We also have a cadre of scientists who
     conduct research on bones, joints, muscles, and skin in laboratories
     on the NIH campus in Bethesda - known as "intramural" research. The
     goal of all of the research that we support - whether at the NIH or
     in other laboratories across the country - is to advance our
     scientific knowledge to improve public health.
