   PNNL Diversity Programs
   People People

   Programs focused on the need to accommodate the changing workforce have
   increased significantly in the past 10 years.  PNNL has developed
   programs in support of an inclusive work culture, staff development and
   partnering with the community.

   SUPPORTING AN INCLUSIVE WORK CULTURE
   The Laboratory initiated the Quality of Work Life Survey as a way to
   measure how well we support our diverse workforce.  The results from
   annual QWL surveys have led to the implementation of many programs that
   serve our staff, some of which are outlined below. For more detailed
   information about PNNL's quality of work life and diversity issues, go
   to the QWL web site (internal access only).

   DEVELOPING OUR WORKFORCE
   PNNL pursues strategies to retain staff and identify and recruit new
   staff to further enhance our diverse workforce.  In doing so, we
   provide resources for quality education, training, and development
   programs that increase staff knowledge and skills and contribute to
   professional growth, and develop new networks and relationships that
   assist with recruitment.

   PARTNERING WITH THE COMMUNITY
   Along with supporting a diverse workforce, we support diversity
   interests of our staff in the community.  Our 3,500 staff members
   volunteer countless hours to activities that range from science
   demonstrations in local classrooms to dramatic rescues on the Columbia
   River.
