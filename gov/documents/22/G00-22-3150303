   Description
   research involves experimental, numerical, and observational
   approaches. We are responsible for geophysical laboratories;
   experimental and operational drilling rigs and associated shops and
   equipment; deployed and deployable seismometers; and borehole logging
   equipment. Our program areas include nuclear explosion monitoring,
   studying weapons effects, environmental restoration, hard and deeply
   buried targets, petroleum exploration, and reservoir characterization.
   EES-11 focuses on five general areas, which are organized around
   disciplinary capabilities. Following is a statement of each of our five
   teams capabilities and recent accomplishments, many of which are
   explained in more detail in the Research Highlights and Project
   Descriptions sections of this report.

   Research Areas
     * nuclear explosion monitoring,
     * weapons effects,
     * environmental restoration,
     * hard and deeply buried targets,
     * dynamic non-linear elasticity,
     * petroleum exploration, and
     * reservoir characterization.

   Projects and Progams
   EES-11 focuses on five general areas organized around disciplinary
   capabilities.
     * Nuclear Explosion Monitoring (NEM) - This team acquires, processes,
       and interprets geophysical and geological data for the DOE Nuclear
       Explosion Monitoring program. New methods and tools for reliably
       locating earthquakes and for discriminating earthquakes from
       explosions are being developed. Our results are being integrated
       into the DOE Knowledge Base, which will be used by the Air Force
       Technical Applications Center to monitor unreported nuclear
       explosions. We recently delivered a substantial amount of data,
       documentation, application tools, and correction surfaces to the
       DOE Knowledge Base. This delivery was the most comprehensive to
       date for the Southeast Asia region and included a special field
       experiment component containing results of ground-truth
       experiments. Our team completed studies of the 1997-1998
       hole-closure explosions at the former Soviet Shagan River Test Site
       in Kazakhstan, collecting the first seismic data ever acquired by a
       U.S. team at this site.
     * Geodynamics - The geodynamics team develops computational tools and
       experimental methods that are applied to national security issues
       that require modeling of the response of geological materials to
       large and rapid deformations. The team is currently studying a
       variety of nuclear and conventional weapons effects and examining
       issues associated with coupling of explosions, including detecting,
       discriminating, and characterizing the underground environment. Our
       team undertook a project sponsored by a geophysical service company
       to apply computational tools to developing and fielding improved
       seismic sources. Our results demonstrated our ability to couple our
       strong-motion finite-difference code, termed Solid Mechanics Code
       (SMC) with our Anelastic Finite Difference Code (AFD) to model the
       near-source energy deposition imparted to the rock media by the
       explosive charges. This was used to model the far field seismic
       wave propagation of that energy.
     * Seismic Modeling and Imaging - The seismic modeling and imaging
       team conducts basic and applied research in wave propagation,
       seismic imaging, scattering, and the interaction of acoustic waves
       with rock mass structure, fabric, and pore fluids. We are
       developing and testing a wide range of new methods for rapid
       modeling of seismic wave propagation and for obtaining improved
       seismic images of the Earths subsurface, using seismic migration
       in regions of geological complexity. We currently have three
       projects: one is focused on investigating improvements to the
       standard ray-theoretical Kirchhoff-based approach; another is
       focused on a class of methods that we call generalized dual-domain
       Fourier methods; and the third is focused on the evaluation of
       elastic and anisotropic wave propagation effects on seismic
       imaging, which is conventionally done with the assumption that the
       earth is acoustic and isotropic. In each project, we are developing
       new methods, implementing them on parallel computers, and
       investigating the range of applicability of the methods by doing
       tests on synthetic (numerical) and field datasets. We demonstrated
       methods to obtain improved images on both the synthetic and field
       datasets. All three projects are collaborative studies with the
       petroleum industry. The team also makes observations and
       interpretation of seismicity that is induced by fluid injection and
       production in energy reservoirs. The team has developed new methods
       for obtaining precise relative locations of the seismic events; we
       have found that the precisely located events often occur along
       structures that are likely flow paths in the reservoirs.
       We have made rapid progress studying the dynamic nonlinear
       elasticity of earth materials. We are developing a comprehensive
       theoretical and experimental framework that (1) employs static and
       dynamic laboratory investigation of materials to provide a
       macroscopic and microscopic description of the elastic state and
       (2) provides for turning the microscopic description into a
       prescription for material properties that can be used to predict
       change in stress state, both static and dynamic.
     * Drilling Systems and Borehole Instrumentation - The drilling team
       develops cutting-edge drilling methods and tools. We also support
       drilling operations for the Environmental Restoration Project. In
       collaboration with the U.S. petroleum industry, this team is
       conducting a broad-based initiative to reduce the cost and impact
       of drilling by using microborehole technology. As part of this
       initiative, the team is adapting commercial coiled-tubing
       technology for surface-based microhole drilling.
     * National Defense - The national defense teams capabilities include
       geology, geophysics, expertise in the geologic phenomena associated
       with explosion dynamics, both subsurface and above ground, and
       intelligence gathering and interpretation using remote sensing
       techniques. Team members support many Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
       requirements, including geologic and intelligence activities. The
       team developed the manual for the conduct of on-site inspection
       activities that ensure treaty compliance. Other team activities
       include geologic modeling for hard and deeply buried targets.

   Vision for the Future

   Geophysical methods are becoming increasingly important for addressing
   a wide range of important issues that face our society, and our group
   is addressing many of these issues. For example, oil exploration is now
   occurring in regions in which resources are more difficult to find and
   characterize because of the complexity of the geology that overlays the
   resource. Because drilling in such regions has become increasingly
   expensive, we need better methods to characterize the earth and
   drilling methods that are less costly. The groups capability to
   develop inexpensively drilled small boreholes and emplace sensors will
   aid both resource exploration and hazard assessment of earthquake
   damage. Characterizing the Earth by modeling wave propagation, another
   skill we are developing, is essential to predict and ultimately
   mitigate the danger posed by large earthquakes in metropolitan areas.

   The willingness of countries to enter into agreements to restrict or
   eliminate nuclear testing is influenced by the ability to verify those
   agreements using seismic observations. And understanding how explosions
   interact with realistic geological structures is important for seismic
   exploration and for defense scenarios.

   Our capabilities indicate that we are well equipped to investigate all
   these problems. By combining our understanding of the Earth with our
   capability for observing and conducting experiments, we are well
   positioned to address problems of relevance to national defense and
   society.
