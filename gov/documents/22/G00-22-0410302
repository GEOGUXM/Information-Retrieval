                   Civil Aviation Authorities of the World
                  and related civil aviation organizations


     Civil aviation authorities are the FAA-equivalent organizations in
       other countries responsible for civil aviation safety matters.

      Questions on regulatory requirements and other information for a
    particular country should be directed to the civil aviation authority
               or other relevant organization in that country.

    Contact us if your government has a civil aviation authority Web site
                              not listed here.
