   The Global Hydrology Resource Center (GHRC) provides both historical
   and current Earth science data, information, and products from
   satellite, airborne, and surface-based instruments. The GHRC acquires
   basic data streams and produces derived products from many instruments
   spread across a variety of instrument platforms. The GHRC is supported
   by NASA and is the data management and user services arm of the Global
   Hydrology & Climate Center (GHCC) in Huntsville, Alabama.

   Space-based lightning observations are obtained from the Lightning
   Imaging Sensor (LIS), the Optical Transient Detector (OTD, 1995-2000),
   and surface validation networks in the continental U.S. and Brazil.
   Global hydrological parameters such as sea surface temperature,
   atmospheric water vapor, wind direction, and atmospheric temperature,
   are derived from several passive microwave instruments aboard the
   Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), NOAA-15, NOAA-16, and
   Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) satellites.

   The GHRC is the host of the Passive Microwave Earth Science Information
   Partner (PM-ESIP), providing measurement of maximum tropical cyclone
   wind speeds, global tropospheric and atmospheric temperatures, and
   observations of tropical rainfall, sea surface temperature, and wind
   speed.

   The Convection and Moisture Experiment (CAMEX) archive provides data
   from the 1998 CAMEX-3 field experiment and has just completed the
   CAMEX-4 field experiment in Jacksonville Florida (August-September,
   2001). CAMEX experiments produce high-resolution spatial and temporal
   information of hurricane structure, dynamics, and motion.

   Most data are publicly available, although some restrictions apply on
   the distribution of commercially obtained data. All data and products
   are currently free of charge. Select Dataset list from the menu for a
   complete list of our data holdings. Please contact GHRC User Services
   if you need additional information or assistance in navigating these
