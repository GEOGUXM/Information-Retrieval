   The Space Telescope Operations Control Center, or STOCC, is where
   controllers direct Hubble's exploration of the Universe. The focal
   point of all Hubble Space Telescope operations, the STOCC is located at
   NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Here Hubble's
   controllers monitor the telescope's health while they direct its
   movements and science activities. Throughout Hubble's 20-year mission,
   the STOCC operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

   During a servicing mission, the STOCC becomes even busier than usual.
   The ground control team trains long, hard hours to prepare for their
   important servicing role. Shortly after launch, they will instruct
   Hubble to stop normal science operations. To prepare it for rendezvous
   and capture, the team will command Hubble's aperture door to close and
   its high gain antennas to be stowed. After capture, as the astronauts
   install new equipment on Hubble, the STOCC team will immediately test
   it. Later, while the crew sleeps, ground controllers will perform more
   detailed checkouts.

   At the end of the mission, the STOCC team will deploy Hubble's high
   gain antennas and open its aperture door. They will reactivate and
   check out all Hubble equipment powered off during the servicing call.
   Then, Discovery's robot arm will release Hubble and normal science
   operations will resume.
