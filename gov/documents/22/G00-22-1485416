                     Heating System Fuel Cost Calculator

    This calculator is designed to compare the yearly operating costs of
    two different heating systems, based on the efficiency of the heater,
   the distribution system, the cost of fuel in your area, and assumes an
              equal amount of space to be heated in both cases.

     For best results, maximize your browser window to full screen when
