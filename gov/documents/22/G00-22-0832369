   Technology Initiative Page from the NASA Stennis Space Center. We
   expect the Stennis page will soon replace this page as the main SSTI
   page.

   This is an experimental service provided by the Small Spacecraft
   Technology Project Office staff at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC.
   The Home Pages's objective is provide a timely and useful service to
   all individuals interested in this subject. We will seek to establish
   connections to all known sources of information and Internet tools
   relevant to this subject. New information will be added as time permits
   and the organization Home Page will change at any time to accommodate
   it.

   SmallSat Goal: Demonstrate a new approach to small spacecraft design
   and development which reduces the cost by an order of magnitude for a
   variety of mission applications.
