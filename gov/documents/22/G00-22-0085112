      [ARO.gif] The Berkeley Lab Archives and Records Office is committed to
      ensuring the comprehensive and on-going collection of records
      documenting the Laboratory and its work. A professional archival and
      records management program, as outlined in the Berkeley Lab Regulations
      and Procedures Manual, provides a unique opportunity to preserve
      multiple levels of documentation such as laboratory administration,
      research and development, and dissemination of information. The
      Archives and Records Office works in close cooperation with the
      National Archives and Records Administration's (NARA's) Pacific Region
      (San Francisco) Records Services Facility in San Bruno to preserve,
      maintain, and provide access to laboratory records, including textual
      records, photographs, maps, architectural and engineering records,
      motion-pictures, videotape, and machine-readable data.
