   Ï Ï Ï Ï Ï Ï Ï JOINT REPORT NO. 7 OF PLAINTIFFS' AND DEFENDANTS' LIAISON
   COUNSEL Plaintiffs' Liaison Counsel (PLC) and Defendants' Liaison
   Counsel (DLC) jointly submit this Report No. 7. I. Virtual Document
   Depository - (Minute Entry, November 16, 2000) PLC and DLC continue to
   discuss the issues regarding a virtual document depository. Considering
   the fact that the documents are being conveniently produced in CD-ROM
   form, the parties may conclude that a virtual document depository is
   not necessary. II. Master Complaint/Answer - (PTO 2 - VI(B)) On March
   22, 2001 the PLC delivered to DLC a draft of the Plaintiffs Position
   Paper Regarding the filing of a Master Complaint and Answer. DLC will
   furnish a draft response to the Plaintiffs Position 1 Paper before the
   Monthly Status Conference. The parties will be prepared to discuss
   their respective positions at the May Monthly Status Conference. III.
   Update of Rolling Document Production and Electronic Document
   Production - (PTO 2 - IX) DLC advises that the next production of
   documents will be rolled out the week of May 14, 2001, with the
   delivery of approximately 700,000 pages on CD-ROM. The documents to be
   produced at this time primarily include materials from the following
   departments: (1) Operations; (2) Research Foundations; (3) Global
   Clinical R&D; (4) Global Site Management; (5) Pharmacology; (6) J&J
   State Government Affairs; (7) Regulatory Affairs; and (8) Medical
   Services. With this production, the total number of pages produced on
   CD-ROM so far will be approximately 2.2 million. With respect to
   electronic preservation and production and Pretrial Order No. 10,
   attachments A and B were inadvertently not included with Pretrial Order
   No. 10, and the parties will file the appropriate motion to provide for
   the attachments of A and B. Continued discussions concerning production
   of electronic data and allocation of associated costs are taking place.
   In the meantime, the parties are also discussing a nominee for Special
   Master as required by Section H(3) of PTO 10. IV. Electronic
   Service/Verilaw - (PTO 2-IV(C)(C)) Verilaw has raised a question
   concerning the security of documents filed under seal that are uploaded
   to Verilaw and served electronically. PLC and DLC are discussing this
   issue with representatives of Verilaw and will report to the Court at
   the Monthly Status Conference concerning what additional measures, if
   any, are necessary to provide appropriate security for documents filed
   under seal or otherwise subject to the provisions of the
   Confidentiality Order that are uploaded to Verilaw and served 2
   electronically. V. State Liaison Counsel - (Minute Entry, November 16,
   2000) State Liaison Counsel have participated in coordination telephone
   calls, depositions and document review. PLC and DLC will be prepared to
   report further about these contributions at the Monthly Status
   Conference, and representatives of the State Liaison Committee will be
   on hand to contribute to the Monthly Status Conference as appropriate.
   VI. 30(b)(6) Deposition Regarding Corporation Organization A 30(b)(6)
   deposition of the Beerse operation will take place in Belgium on June
   5, 2001. Derk Reyn will be designated as the corporate representative
   to respond to the notice. The parties stipulate that there is no need
   to issue a subpoena or otherwise conduct discovery pursuant to the
   Hague Convention and that the deposition will be conducted in Belgium
   as if it were taken in the United States at a mutually agreeable time
   and place. VII. Patient Profile Form and Authorization As of Friday,
   May 11, 2001, defendants have received 202 Patient Profile Forms
   (PPFs). One hundred ninety-four (194) are currently overdue and 35 PPFs
   will become due within thirty (30) days. Each Friday DLC delivers to
   the PLC a status report and list of PPFs that are currently overdue.
   Each week in response to this list, PLC sends out a letter directly to
   the plaintiff attorneys whose PPFs are indicated to be overdue.
   Additionally, DLC has sent 22 letters directly to plaintiff counsel
   with copies to PLC, to attorneys representing plaintiffs whose PPFs are
   more than thirty (30) days overdue. VIII. Depositions in State Matters
   that have been Cross Noticed The deposition of Gary Pruden, Janssen
   Director of Marketing, was taken in state court litigation 3 and cross
   noticed in the MDL. The deposition occurred on April 25-27, 2001, and
   representatives of the PSC were present. The deposition of Stephen
   Spielberg, M.D., Janssen Vice President of Pediatric Drug Development,
   occurred on May 10-11, 2001, and representatives of the PSC were also
   present for that deposition. All of these depositions were cross
   noticed subject to the MDL's reservation of rights to retake these
   depositions. IX. Subpoena to FDA On May 8, 2001, PLC and DLC received a
   fax from the Associate Chief Counsel of the FDA concerning this
   subpoena. The Associate Chief Counsel requested a specific
   authorization from defendants with respect to the release of FDA files,
   and defendants will provide this specific authorization. The Associate
   Chief Counsel also explained certain logistical issues involving the
   Bates numbering format that has been requested by the litigants, and
   PLC and DLC are attempting to respond to these issues with the FDA.
   Approximately 4,600 pages shall be produced by FDA in the initial
   production, and another 11 cartons are to be produced following FDA's
   review. The timing of this production is being discussed with FDA. X.
   Service List of Attorneys Since the last Monthly Status Conference,
   representatives of PLC and DLC met with the Deputy Clerk with respect
   to providing for the development of a complete and correct service
   list. At the June Monthly Status Conference, PLC and DLC will deliver
   to the Court and its staff what is believed to be the most current and
   complete service list. The Court has since modified its Consolidation
   Order, which is distributed to all newly transferred cases to MDL 1355,
   to instruct counsel to contact Liaison Counsel upon the transfer of
   their case to the Court. (See paragraph 12 of Minute Entry of April 19,
   2001). Upon the 4 appearance of new plaintiff counsel, PLC will send a
   letter to each new plaintiff counsel advising about: (1) the Court's
   Propulsid website; (2) the necessity to submit a Verilaw questionnaire;
   and (3) the deadline for furnishing Patient Profile Forms. DLC will
   send a letter to newly enrolled defense counsel informing them of the
   Court's Propulsid website and the ready availability to review all
   issued PTOs and the docket from the website. XI. Ongoing Studies The
   parties are continuing to discuss the development of a protocol for the
   production of ongoing studies. In the meantime, defendants have already
   produced some materials involving ongoing studies. XII. New Agenda
   Items: 1. Third Party Subpoena Duces Tecum Issued by PSC. 2. Scheduling
   Presentation of Class Certification Motion. 3. Documents Described in
   the Court's Docket as "SEALED document." 4. Discussion of Tolling
   Agreements. Respectfully submitted, /s/ Russ M. Herman RUSS M. HERMAN,
