     Welcome to the NIH's Bioethics Resources on the Web! The Internet is
     replete with resources available to those with an interest in
     bioethics including education, research involving human participants
     and animals, medical and health care ethics, and the implications of
     applied genetics and biotechnology. This website contains a broad
     collage of annotated web links, and while this list is
     comprehensive, it is not totally inclusive. The listed resources
     provide background information and various positions on issues in
     bioethics. Where possible, we have linked directly to those
     positions. Click here for more information on this site.
