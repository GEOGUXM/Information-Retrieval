      Newsroom Resources

      Press Releases

      Press releases provide the latest information from NASA about present
      and future missions to Mars.

      Press Kits

      Press kits are prepared before major spacecraft missions. Each press
      kit offers detailed background on the mission. However, press kits are
      not subsequently updated, so the content provides a snapshot of the
      mission at a particular point in time.

      Fact Sheets

      Mission fact sheets provide concise overviews of JPL's Mars missions.
      This information is relatively brief, but usually up-to-date.

      High-Resolution Images

      View our favorite images of Martian surface features, future spacecraft
      and more. For more high-resolution images of Mars, visit NASA's
      Planetary Photojournal.
