                  Welcome to e-Portals in Commerce (e-PIC)!

     __________________________________________________________________

   e-Portals in Commerce (e-PIC) is an e-business system designed to
   smartly capture the global marketplace and profile information about
   organizations providing products and services. The system is designed
   to function on a Web platform and links users of the system conducting
   market research or seeking sources of supplies and services to this
   virtual market place.

   System Sponsorship: Designed, developed, and implemented by the
   National Institutes of Health Small Business Office, with technical
   guidance support and co-project direction from the Office of the
   Director (OD), Office of Information Technology (OIT). e-PIC system
   design and development was accomplished with contractor support and
   input from a "Test Study Group" comprised of Federal and private
   officials from cross-functional areas of business processes.

   System Administration: The NIH Small Business Office, with contractor
   support, serves as the System Administrator." e-PIC resides on the NIH
   OD/OIT SQL and Web servers in the office that serves as the "System
   Technical Administrator."

   System Design Structure and Features: e-PIC embraces new ASP and IIS
   Web technology, while residing on the MS SQL Server 7 to provide
   cross-platform connectivity. e-PIC comports with Federal and
   International Web standards for design and development, including with
   "508" compliancy. e-PIC design was based on a modular and layered
   conceptual framework and is able to expand both horizontally and
   vertically through new design, bridges and plug-ins to other systems.
   e-PIC engages a simple user-friendly interface for system registration
   and searching. e-PIC maintains a community bulletin board for
   networking and business development. e-PIC links to the Federal Object
   Classification Code system to facilitate purchasing and to itâ€™s own
   unique North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS)engine,
   which serves as an encyclopedic reference for acquisition
   classification and size information. e-PIC links to various contract
   vehicles and Federal past performance systems.

   Registration: The registration process only is required for
   organizations interested in showcasing and promoting organizational
   information, including an organization's products and/or services.
   Registration is not required to conduct "searches" of the system.

   Data Collection: Organizational profile information, such as name,
   address, business description, etc., and pertinent NAICS codes and
   other related information is input on-line, around the clock by
   regis-trants, who create, manage and secure their unique passwords and
   hyperlinked organizational information. Data collection is accomplished
   directly through data field input or HTML enabled forms that are
   accessible through profile hyperlinks. This information is smartly
   crossed with other secured data fields, e.g. "number of employees" and
   "average annual sales" to correctly size organizations for Federal
   acquisition purposes.

   Profile information is dynamic and portable. Pages I through III of
   registration collect mandatory information. Pages IV through VIII
   collect optional information. Completing optional information data
   fields is strongly recommended, since a more comprehensive and robust
   organizational profile will present itself, when e-PIC is searched.

   Accessibility and Cost: e-PIC is accessible by "registrants" and
   "searchers" at no cost. System navigation requires no training and is
   accomplished with uniform and convenient navigational tools throughout
   the system.
