     Many people would say that Holtville is a community that has changed
     very little since the beginning of the century. However, Holtville
     has had a colorful history and will surely have a colorful future.
     The city of Holtville, or Holton as it was first called, was founded
     by W.F. Holt. Holt was a banker from Missouri who moved to the west
     for health reasons. Holt had a vision of what the Imperial Valley
     would become, and in the process he was the first to envision a town
     east of the Alamo River.

     In 1903, the city of Holtville was born. Construction of the new
     town was slow in the beginning because of a town policy which only
     allowed  brick construction. That policy was later changed. On June
     20, 1908 the city of Holtville was incorporated.

     At a cost of $15,000, the first permanent structure was built in
     Holtville. The grand Alamo Hotel was a two story building with hotel
     rooms on the second floor and a restaurant on the bottom floor.
     Since Holtville was about 16 feet below sea level, the hotel's
     slogan was "Eat below sea level, sleep above sea level."

     By 1904, the development of the Holton Inter-Urban railroad provided
     freight service between the cities of Holtville and Imperial. In
     1918, a special car was used on the Inter-Urban.  It was a car that
     was fitted with wheels that permitted it to run on the train tracks,
     as well as, drive on the street like a normal car. W.F. Holt`s
     design made it possible for the Inter-Urban to provide door-to-door
     deliveries of people and goods.

     The city of Holtville had a master plan for  its downtown district.
     The city was designed so that businesses faced Holt Park, which
     formed a town square. Holt Park is the focus for the city of
     Holtville which boasted large, lush shade trees, and the City Hall
     building... a two story structure that was built in the center of
     the Park. There have been several changes in Holt Park but it still
     remains the gem of the city. At one time, the Park even had a monkey
     cage and a fish pond. However, what remains today is a time capsule
     which is to be opened in the year 2015.

     Fire has been a major tragedy to the city of Holtville and, in some
     ways, has affected all the citizens of Holtville. In the 1960's, the
     Holtville Unified School District, which consisted of a two story
     structure, was destroyed by a fire. A theater that once graced Main
     Street in Holtville was also destroyed by fire in the 1970's.  And
     sadly, a large section of the Holtville Business District was also
     destroyed by fire in the 1980's.

     All in all, Holtville is a wonderful town that has a lot to offer.
     With its colorful past and bright future, people will continue to
     call Holtville home. Once you have lived in Holtville, it will
     always be the place you call home.
