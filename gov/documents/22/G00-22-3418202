   Discrimination
   gold bar with blue star
   The Department's Civil Rights Division is the primary institution
   within the federal government responsible for enforcing federal
   statutes prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, sex,
   handicap, religion, and national origin.

   Initiative to Combat the Post-9/11 Discriminatory Backlash
   The Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights has directed the Civil
   Rights Divisions National Origin Working Group to help combat
   violations of federal civil and criminal rights laws affecting
   individuals perceived to be of Middle Eastern descent.

   Federal Protections Against National Origin Discrimination explains the
   laws prohibiting national origin discrimination. Laws that prohibit
   national origin discrimination make it illegal to discriminate because
   of a person's birthplace, ancestry, culture or language. The brochure
   also gives information on how to file a complaint based on this type of
   discrimination.
