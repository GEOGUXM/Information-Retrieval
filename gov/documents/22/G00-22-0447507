      STD Sequence Databases [BUTTON Input] (not implemented)___________

   These specialized databases are an expansion of the human
   papillomavirus project funded by the Sexually Transmitted Diseases
   Branch of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,
   National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National
   Institutes of Health, Bethesda Maryland. The scope of the project now
   includes molecular information pertaining to sexually transmitted
   bacteria and viruses -- especially, though not limited to, molecular
   sequence data. It is anticipated that the database and analysis project
   will run for approximately five year s starting in 1998, and therefore
   that its content will be continually expanding. (A specialized database
   is one in which analysis and compilation go hand in hand) In the
   earliest version, the focus was upon the recently sequenced genomes of
   Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium,
   Treponema pallidum, Ureaplasma urealyticum, as well as Human
   Papillomavirus. Human Herpesvirus 1 (HSV - 1) and Human Herpesvirus 2
   (HSV - 2) were aded in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Neisseria
   gonorrheaeand Haemophilus ducreyi will be added as they become
   available.

   The Oral Pathogen Sequence Databases are funded by the National
   Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) within the
   National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Maryland. The Oral Pathogen
   Databases now have their own URL and are available at:
   www.oralgen.lanl.gov.
