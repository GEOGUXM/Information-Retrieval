   Our 4th annual Kids Fishing Derby was held on May 20th, at the Goddard
   Pond. 13 youth and their parents endured drizzle and cool temperatures,
   but everyone had a great time. Shown below are some photographs of the
   event collected so far. (Thanks to Joe Joyner for providing the first 3
      images, and thanks for Debbie and Lisa for the photographing and
                             scanning the rest).
