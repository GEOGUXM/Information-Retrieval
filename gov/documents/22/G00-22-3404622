Waiver Process

For the California State Board of Education

   This page is designed to provide local educational agencies with
   information and forms to prepare a waiver request.

   The purpose of a waiver is to provide flexibility in a school district
   or county office of education without undermining the basic intent of
   the law. The governing boards of school districts and county offices of
   education can waive parts of the California Education Code under the
   State Board of Education's (SBE) general waiver authority, Sections
   33050-33053. Specific waivers are under the authority of specific
   education codes sections and are more limited in scope.
