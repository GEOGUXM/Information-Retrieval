How NTIS Helps You

   Whether you are a research scientist, corporate librarian, or
   government engineer, NTIS can help you today and tomorrow through its
   mission as the central source for U.S. Government scientific,
   technical, and business information. For example, you can conduct
   detailed subject searches through the NTIS Government Research Center's
   online databases at http://grc.ntis.gov. You also can use our Web site,
   www.ntis.gov, to lookup any of the 400,000 documents in our collection
   since 1990. Perhaps you purchase annually the U.S. Statistical Abstract
   and need to know when it will be available for sale this year. You can
   locate that information from our Web site under our bestsellers list.

   The NTIS customer comments collected over the last 50 years value the
   breadth and depth of the NTIS collection, and also praise the speed of
   locating and fulfilling product orders with friendly customer service.
