     Medical Applications Subcommittee Holds Workshop on Bone Palliation
                            Radiopharmaceuticals

   An estimated combined total of 80,000 people die of breast or prostate
   cancer in the United States every year. Of these cases, a significant
   number (60-80 %) will experience the excruciating pain associated with
   bone metastases. Many new drugs in a class of radiopharmaceuticals,
   called bone palliation agents, are being developed every year in an
   effort to relieve this condition.

   On September 27, 1996, NIST and the Council on Ionizing Radiation
   Measurements and Standards (CIRMS) Medical Subcommittee held a workshop
   to discuss the current status of research in bone palliation
   radiopharmaceuticals and to identify future measurement needs in the
   radiopharmaceutical industry in general. Among the invited speakers
   were representatives from the three nuclear reactor facilities in the
   U. S. that produce most of the radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine
   in this country (University of Missouri, Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
   and Brookhaven National Laboratory), as well as representatives from
   the two largest isotope-production facilities in Russia (Research
   Institute of Atomic Reactors, Dimitrovgrad and Institute of Physics and
   Power Engineering, Obninsk). The workshop was also attended by
   representatives of several radiopharmaceutical and instrument
   manufacturers (Bio-Nucleonics, Capintec, DuPont Merck, Mallinckrodt,
   and Nordion), as well as the U. S. government agencies involved with
   radiopharmaceutical production and regulation (Department of Energy,
   Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and Food and Drug Administration).

   Talks by the invited speakers allowed the Medical Subcommittee to
   examine the Measurement Program Description (MPD) given in the January
   1995 CIRMS Needs Report. The workshop concluded with an open session to
   discuss concerns of the attendees regarding measurement and regulation
   of radiopharmaceuticals.

   The main concern that was expressed is the need for a consistent
   measurement protocol at all stages of radiopharmaceutical production
   and administration in a way that is traceable to NIST. Currently, these
   agents are usually measured in geometries at the manufacturing
   facilities and at the radiopharmacies that differ from NIST standards.
   This can result in a difference of up to 10 % or more between the
   amount of radioactivity actually delivered to the patient and that
   which would obtained using NIST measurement methodologies.
   Standardization of these measurement protocols can result in increased
   safety to the patient and to the hospital staff and can help to reduce
   patient costs.

   Brian Zimmerman at NIST is revising the MPD for radionuclide standards
   to include the information presented at the workshop.

   A Message from the President

   CIRMS, your organization, was pleased to note in the previous
   newsletter its recognition before Congress in the testimony given by
   Dr. Katherine Gebbie, Director of the Physics Laboratory at NIST, of
   CIRMS's role in facilitating the implementation of standards for
   mammography testing, as outlined in one of our Measurement Program
   Descriptions (MPD's). CIRMS, however, has achieved much more than this.

   At our recent second annual Executive Committee retreat, a one day
   session held at NIST for the members of the Executive Committee and the
   Chairs of the Subcommittees of the Science and Technology Committee, we
   reviewed the status of all of the twentytwo MPD's defined in the
   CIRMS's "Report on National Needs in Ionizing Radiation Measurements."
   Beyond the completion of the MPD on mammography testing, we are pleased
   to report that considerable progress has been made on most of the MPD's
   and that new MPD's are being entertained by each of the four
   subcommittees. To further the progress towards implementation, Larry
   DeWerd has developed roadmaps or program plans for a couple of the
   MPD's so that strategies needed to fulfill CIRMS's proactive posture
   can be defined. These types of plans will now become part of each MPD.

   This may give you an insight into how CIRMS operates. Besides our
   annual meeting and this newsletter, CIRMS conducts most of its business
   through the activities of the four subcommittees of the Science and
   Technology Committee Chaired by Joe McDonald. These subcommittees cover
   the diverse areas involved in ionizing radiation, the Medical area,
   chaired by Tom Heaton, the Occupational Protection area, chaired by Ken
   Swinth, the Public/Environmental Protection area, now chaired by Dave
   McCurdy, and the Radiation Effects area, chaired by Paul Farrell. Each
   of these subcommittees attempts to meet at least one time during the
   year outside of our own annual meeting. Since CIRMS is a volunteer
   organization, not being part of NIST, but serving in an advisory
   capacity to NIST and others, we hope that you will follow your own
   interests and become involved in one of these subcommittees. The first
   day of our annual meeting, November 12, has been set aside to welcome
   your involvement. This is where the action is; this is how we stimulate
   CIRMS's proactive mission.

   To facilitate our communications with you, Bob Loesch and Bill Casson
   are in the process of developing a CIRMS home page on the world wide
   web. To better serve you our members, CIRMS's Executive Committee makes
   routine use of email and regularly holds monthly teleconference calls.

   As in all areas of science and technology, such progress is built on
   the efforts of those who have proceeded us, PastPresidents Marsh
   Cleland, Peter Almond and Tom Bell and our Past Chairman of the Science
   and Technology Bill Koch. Now I would like to welcome you, your company
   and your organization to share in this progress. At our annual meeting,
   we will discuss more about the advantages of CIRMS membership. While
   not large in numbers, CIRMS is evolving as a significant influence in
   all areas involving ionizing radiation. See you at the annual meeting.

   CIRMS Focuses Fifth Annual Meeting on University Contributions to
   Ionizing Radiation Measurements and Standards

   Following publication of the first CIRMS Report on National Needs in
   Ionizing Radiation Measurements and Standards in January, 1995, the
   CIRMS subcommittees have been looking at how these high-priority needs
   could be translated into "roadmaps" for the measurements community. The
   most widely known and successful industry roadmap is the Semiconductor
   Industry Association Roadmap on Semiconductor Technology. The working
   groups that prepared the semiconductor roadmap made the interesting
   observation that universities contribute research and technology at two
   distinct phases in process research and development. Eight to ten years
   before the introduction of new process technology the universities are
   engaged in innovative research. Two to four years prior to introduction
   of new technology, the universities are involved in collaborative R&D
   with industry in developing the underpinnings of the new technology.

   It was evident to the CIRMS Executive Committee that the reason that
   university-based scientists have been enthusiastic supporters of CIRMS
   is that they too are involved in new radiation detection and
   measurement technology in ways that parallel those noted in the
   semiconductor industry. Some of the university research is directed
   towards long-term problems. In other instances, they are working in
   collaboration with industry, national laboratories and government
   agencies to solve more immediate measurement problems. Many of these
   immediate problems were identified in the 1995 Needs Report.

   For this year's CIRMS annual meeting we have invited sixteen speakers
   from university research departments to talk about their research
   programs. In each of the four areas covered by CIRMS scientific
   subcommittees - medical applications, occupational radiation
   protection, environmental radioactivity, and radiation effects on
   materials - the CIRMS community will get an update on the key research
   agendas in these sixteen academic departments. Their collective input
   will be very important in helping the CIRMS subcommittees in their
   roadmapping exercises. For example, if these Measurement Program
   Descriptions (MPDs) that CIRMS has identified are important, we expect
   to find that universities are already devoting graduate students and
   postdoctoral personnel to those efforts. Through this, CIRMS hopes to
   strengthen the bond between university activities and national needs as
   perceived by industry and government.

   CIRMS Holds Second Executive Committee Retreat

   The CIRMS Executive Committee, which is composed of the President,
   former President, the first and second vice-Presidents, the Chairman of
   the Science and Technology Committee, the four chairmen of the Science
   and Technology Subcommittees, the Secretary/Treasurer, and the
   appointed NIST representative, met at NIST in September to discuss
   future directions and goals for the CIRMS organization. The meeting,
   headed by President Tony Berejka, discussed the cores values of the
   organization and the implementation of the Measurement Program
   Descriptions (MPDs). In addition, groundwork was laid for the upcoming
   annual meeting of the Council at NIST in November.

   Emphasis during the meeting was placed on the MPDs since that is where
   the Council will have the greatest impact on the direction of the
   radiation measurements and standards community. The MPDs are divided by
   subject according to the specific subcommittee of the Science and
   Technology Committee which is responsible for sponsoring the effort.
   The subcommittees are: the Medical Subcommittee, Public/Environmental
   Subcommittee, Occupational Radiation Protection Subcommittee, and the
   Radiation Effects on Materials Subcommittee.

   The following is a list of discussed MPDs:

   Medical Subcommittee

   A-1 National Air-Kerma Standards for Mammography

   Leading Medical Accelerator Manufacturer Acquired

   MeV Industries S.A. has become part of the Thomson-CSF Group. The new
   company will be known as Thomson-CSF Linac. Thomson-CSF Linac will
   continue to provide design, installation, and maintenance for
   industrial linear accelerators including those used widely for
   sterilization of medical products, conservation of food, and the
   polymerization of materials. CIRMS looks forward to the participation
   of the new company in the measurements and standards community.

   CRADA Leads to Commercialization of EB Curing of Epoxy Resins

   Recent licenses have been granted for the marketing of a new technology
   related to the development of new epoxy resins which can be cross
   linked by ionizing radiation, specifically electron beams. The
   Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) sponsored by the
   U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Defense Programs was granted to
   the Oak Ridge Centers for Manufacturing Technology (ORCMT) and several
   industrial partners.

   Applications of the new technology is expected to be very wide,
   including applications to aerospace, automobile, sporting goods and
   other manufacturing areas. Although e-beam curing has been applied to
   crosslinking polymers the applications have been limited due to the
   lack of range of the applications of the available materials. The new
   materials and technologies will allow improvements which include rapid
   curing in assembly line environments, increased dimensional stability,
   improved product end characteristics, lower tooling cost, reduced
   emissions, and increased applications which will allow manufacturing of
   components which could not be economically mass produced in the past.
