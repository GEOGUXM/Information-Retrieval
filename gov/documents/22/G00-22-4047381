                 Federal Government Operating Status on Oahu


    "Federal agencies on Oahu are OPEN; employees are expected to report
    for work on time."

   The information above will be updated whenever operating status is
   anything other than OPEN.

   This page provides current information on the operating status of
   federal agencies on Oahu.  Information will be posted whenever there is
   a situation in which significant numbers of employees are prevented
   from reporting for work on time or which require agencies to close all
   or part of their activities.

   Procedures are applicable to Oahu only due to the limitations of the
   Emergency Notification System and diverse conditions of the neighbor
   islands.  Agencies who have offices on the neighbor islands should
   provide guidance to their managers and supervisors to make decisions
   regarding dismissal as dictated by local conditions.

   See the FEB Guidelines for Dismissal of Federal Employees during
   Emergency Situations for further information.
