   Federal Register Documents  U.S. Department of Education

   This directory contains documents published in the Federal Register by
   the U.S. Department of Education. ED documents are obtained from the
   Federal Register database maintained by the Government Printing Office
   (GPO). The GPO database, which includes the complete and up-to-date
   contents of the 1994-present Federal Register in a searchable database,
   is accessible through GPO's menu of Federal Depository Library
   Gateways.

   Documents from October 1995 through the present are included in this
   ED-specific subset. In each category, documents are listed in reverse
   chronological order, with the most recent documents at the top of the
   list. In addition to basic text, most documents are also available in
   portable document format (PDF). Documents available in PDF format are
   denoted with the PDF icon: PDF Icon
     * Proposed Regulations, Priorities, and Other Rules
     * Final Regulations, Priorities, and Other Rules
     * Announcements (Grant Competitions, Requests for Comment, etc.)
     * Other (Information Collections, Meetings, etc.)

   As a convenience to the user we also provide a search capability that
   covers all our Federal Register Document holdings.
