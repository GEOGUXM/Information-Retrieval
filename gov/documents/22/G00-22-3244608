   SFINANC2 PsN: SFINANC2 FOREWORD One of the highest honors that can come
   to a Member of the U.S. Senate is to serve on the Committee on Finance.
   The Committee on Finance has since its creation been associated with
   some of the most significant and most controversial issues in U.S.
   history. For well over a century protectionism versus free trade was
   the major domestic economic issue in this country. Borrowing authority
   handled by the Committee has to a large extent financed the major wars
   of this century; and income taxes initiated more than sixty years ago
   represent the major source of governmental income today. Legislation
   acted on by the Committee on Finance raises virtually all of the
   Federal revenue; expenditures authorized in legislation handled by the
   committee represent almost one-half of the Federal budget. Overall, the
   Committee on Finance handles legislation involving more money than any
   other Committee in the Congress. The Committee on Finance today
   consists of 20 members. On the basis of the present ratio of party
   representation in the Senate, eleven Republicans and nine Democrats
   serve on the Committee. These mem- bers are held in high esteem by
   their fellow Senators. It is an indica- tion of the high regard in
   which Finance Committee members are held that a special committee,
   chaired by the late John F. Kennedy, former Senator from Massachusetts
   and President of the United States, se- lected as five outstanding
   Senators in U.S. history five men all of whom had served on the
   Committee on Finance. This brief history of the Committee and its areas
   of jurisdiction is intended to acquaint the reader with the involvement
   of the Com- mittee in the major public issues in which the Finance
   Committee par- ticipates and to give some indication of the Committee's
   major role in shaping U.S. policy in these areas. ROBERT J. DOLE,
   Chairman. (V) VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:50 Sep 18, 2001 Jkt 072962 PO

   FINANCE COMMITTEE ROLE OF SENATE COMMITTEES TODAY To many people, the
   Congress appears to work in mysterious ways to produce mysterious
   things. The principal mystery seems to be the almost miraculous
   emergence of complex legislation, fullblown in a myriad of technical
   details. In fact, however, the legislative process is characterized by
   hard work rather than mystery. In iceberg fashion, the bulk of the work
   is below the surface and not readily visible. Most of this
   ``invisible'' effort is performed in the committee rooms of the Con-
   gress. Everyone would agree that legislation affecting the entire
   Nation should receive most thorough, expert, and informed review prior
   to being formally voted upon by the full Senate. The committees of the
   U.S. Senate are designed to-and do-provide the mechanism for that
   thorough and expert consideration. As the Nation's problems become more
   complex, the committee sys- tem is ever more useful and ever more
   necessary to the effective func- tioning of the Senate. Legislation
   designed to deal with complex prob- lems is often, of necessity,
   intricate. Few Senators can devote the time required to develop the
   expertise necessary for a thorough under- standing of the background
   and details of every major legislative pro- posal. Much of their time
   is taken up in seeing constituents from home, helping individuals,
   groups, and communities-indeed their en- tire State-with problems
   before the many Federal agencies, answering voluminous correspondence,
   and appearing at various meetings, and State and community functions
   back home. For this reason, most Mem- bers tend to rely upon their
   committees to provide them with legisla- tive recommendations based
   upon the experience and expert knowl- edge of the members and staffs of
   those committees which have juris- diction over the subject matter of
   particular bills. The virtues of the Senate's committee system are
   generally recog- nized by all Senators. It is for this reason that a
   bill which has been (1) VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:50 Sep 18, 2001 Jkt

   SFINANC2 2 considered and approved by a committee is usually approved
   by the full Senate. A special committee set up to study the
   organization of Congress reported in 1966 that over 90 percent of all
   legislation is fi- nally passed in the form reported out by the
   appropriate committee to the floor. At the same time, those bills which
   have not had the ben- efit of committee consideration are seldom
   enacted into law. Another important function of the committee structure
   is that each committee provides a source of expert advice and
   assistance in the areas of its competence to all Senators, members and
   nonmembers of the committee alike. A Senator, for example, might call
   upon a com- mittee to assist him in drafting legislation or request its
   informal com- ments upon the merits of a proposal he is considering. He
   might also request a committee to examine the operation of existing law
   or even to investigate a problem which might ultimately require
   legislation to provide a remedy. The committee has an ``oversight''
   responsibility also. It has the au- thority and duty to investigate,
   review, and evaluate the effectiveness of existing laws over which it
   has legislative authority. How well is a par- ticular agency of the
   executive branch administering the legislation en- acted by the
   Congress? Is a particular law or section of law, being ad- ministered
   in a manner consistent with the intent of the Congress when it enacted
   that law? What changes might be required in a law to improve and
   enhance it? The committee system is a mechanism by which Congress
   satisfies itself that the laws of this country are sound, and that they
   are administered according to the intent of Congress. It is a process
   which involves a continuing search for improved ways and means of
   meeting the needs of the American people in efficient and economical
   fashion. Finally, the committees of the Senate serve to strengthen the
   ``sepa- ration of powers'' provisions of the Constitution of the United
   States. True separation of powers could not be achieved, for example,
   if the Senate were dependent solely upon the executive branch for
   informa- tion and advice. Through its committees, the Senate has access
   to its own sources of information, expertise, and knowledge. Thus,
   there ex- ists a meaningful check upon the executive branch. If the
   Senate were forced to rely solely upon the executive branch, it could
   be subjected to self-serving and biased information which would have to
   go largely unchallenged. Fortunately, the elected representatives of
   the people, through the committee system, can serve as members of a
   truly inde- pendent and coequal branch of the Federal Government. THE

   importance may in large part be gaged from an examination of the areas
   of legislation over which it has VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:50 Sep 18, 2001

   PsN: SFINANC2 3 jurisdiction. In terms of this yardstick, the Finance
   Committee is sec- ond to none in the Senate in terms of the legislative
   responsibilities entrusted to it. Senate rule XXV states that at the
   commencement of each Congress there shall be appointed a: Committee on
   Finance, to which committee shall be referred all pro- posed
   legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters re-
   lating to the following subjects: 1. Bonded debt of the United States *
   * * 2. Customs, collection districts, and ports of entry and delivery.
   3. Deposit of public moneys. 4. General revenue sharing. 5. Health
   programs under the Social Security Act and health pro- grams financed
   by a specific tax or trust fund. 6. National social security. 7.
   Reciprocal trade agreements. 8. Revenue measures generally * * * 9.
   Revenue measures relating to the insular possessions. 10. Tariffs and
   import quotas, and matters related thereto. 11. Transportation of
   dutiable goods. Under the Constitution, revenue measures must originate
   in the House of Representatives. Thus the work of the Finance Committee
   typically falls in the latter months of the session. CASE STUDY OF A
   BILL The language of a Senate or House bill often appears to have a
   cold and impersonal character. The cool quality of formal legislative
   lan- guage is basically the product of efforts at precision and
   brevity. It is deceptive, however, as most important legislative
   proposals are, in fact, subjected to substantial amounts of both heat
   and light during the course of congressional consideration.
   Congressional proposals, and ultimately the laws themselves, must be as
   precise as possible in order that the intentions of the sponsors of the
   legislation and the Congress be clearly understood by those af- fected,
   including the public agencies charged with implementing our laws and
   the courts which may eventually be called upon to interpret them. But
   the language of enacted legislation is not always sufficient indica-
   tion of congressional intent. It is at this point that the public
   agencies and the courts look to the various stages of the legislative
   process lead- ing to enactment of the statute for clarification and
   explanation of in- tent. In this regard, committee reports on
   legislation are a primary source of guidance and reliance. Committee
   reports often provide ex- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:50 Sep 18, 2001 Jkt

   SFINANC2 4 planations-pages in length-describing the background and
   purpose of a provision which may consist of only one short sentence in
   a stat- ute. There are several stages in the legislative history of a
   public law which are capable of serving as guideposts to congressional
   intent. Each reference point has a different priority in terms of
   evaluating in- tent. It is possible to find a clear explanation of a
   provision at one point which is contradicted at another. In this entire
   procedure, the key to resolution of contradiction and confusion is the
   determination of who said what and when. The ``who'' of greatest
   importance is the committee having jurisdic- tion over the legislation
   involved. The ``when'' of significance is the last statement dealing
   with the matter in question made by the com- mittee or its
   representative, the ``floor manager'' of the bill as reported by the
   committee. It is only when these sources prove inadequate, or when an
   amendment is adopted during floor debate on the bill, that there is
   recourse to the statements of the individual sponsors of the
   legislation and general floor discussion of the proposal. It would be
   helpful, therefore, in understanding the role of the Fi- nance
   Committee in the congressional process. to chart the progress of a
   significant piece of legislation through the formal and informal stages
   of its consideration and eventual passage by Congress. Public Law 8997,
   the Social Security Amendments of 1965, offers a good example of
   legislation which has been exposed to the full range and breadth of
   congressional consideration. (In Public Law 8997, the ``89'' indicates
   that the law was passed by the 89th Congress; the ``97'' denotes that
   this law was the 97th public statute enacted by the 89th Congress.)
   Public Law 8997, while including a number of important amendments to
   the Social Security Act, is principally known as the Medicare law. It
   represents the legislative culmination of many years of controversy,
   discussion. and hard work. 1. Introduction of the bill.-In January
   1965, Senator Clinton P. Ander- son, joined by more than 40 other
   Senators, introduced the proposal to establish a program of hospital
   insurance for the aged as part of the social security system. The
   Anderson bill, strongly supported and rec- ommended by President Lyndon
   B. Johnson, was Senate bill 1 of the 89th Congress. An identical bill
   was introduced in the House of Rep- resentatives by Representative
   Cecil R. King as H.R. 1. Of course, the King-Anderson bill did not
   suddenly appear on the congressional scene. Its legislative genesis was
   years earlier. In fact, the Senate had voted on a Medicare amendment in
   the 86th, 87th, and 88th Congresses. The proposal was rejected in the
   86th and 87th Con- gresses, but it was approved by the Senate in the
   88th Congress. How- ever, in the 88th Congress, tile House of
   Representatives and the Sen- ate could not formally resolve their
   differences with respect to the var- ious amendments to the Social
   Security Act, and the Medicare amend- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:50 Sep 18,

   SFINANC2 PsN: SFINANC2 5 ment approved by the Senate ``died'' with the
   adjournment of that Congress. 2. Action by House of
   Representatives.-The Constitution requires that all revenue measures
   originate in the House of Representatives. The committee with
   responsibility for revenue legislation in the House is the Ways and
   Means Committee. Amendments to the Social Security Act are classified
   as ``revenue'' legislation since they generally involve adjustments in
   the payroll taxes required to finance the program. For that reason, as
   with revenue proposals generally, the Senate and its Fi- nance
   Committee do not usually act on social security amendments in the
   absence of a social security or other revenue bill which has been
   passed by the House of Representatives and forwarded to the Senate for
   its consideration. During January and February 1965, the Committee on
   Ways and Means held 11 days of executive (nonpublic) hearings on H.R.
   1, the Medicare bill. Public hearings lasting several weeks had
   previously been held by the committee during the 88th Congress.
   Following those exec- utive hearings and a series of committee
   meetings, a substantially re- vised and expanded bill representing the
   consensus of a majority of the members of the Ways and Means Committee
   was introduced by the chairman, Representative Wilbur D. Mills, as a
   new proposal, H.R. 6675. It was this bill, as further amended, which
   ultimately became Public Law 8997. On March 29, 1965, H.R. 6675 was
   reported out of committee to the House of Representatives. The
   ``reporting'' procedure included sub- mission of a lengthy committee
   report H. Rept. 213) explaining and justifying the various provisions
   of the bill. Following consideration by the Rules Committee of the
   House, a res- olution was adopted by the House setting the ``ground
   rules'' for House consideration of the bill. The Rules Committee has
   responsi- bility for assigning priorities to legislation to facilitate
   orderly floor con- sideration of bills. Ten hours of debate was
   provided for, as well as a ``closed rule.'' Under a ``closed rule'' the
   bill may not, generally, be changed by amendments offered on the floor
   of the House of Rep- resentatives during consideration of the measure.
   This feature is unique to the House of Representatives. In the Senate,
   debate is not limited except by unanimous consent or by adoption of a
   cloture peti- tion. On April 8, 1965, H.R. 6675 was passed by the House
   of Representa- tives by a vote of 313 yeas to 115 nays. The bill was
   then forwarded to the Senate for its consideration. 3. Action by
   Senate.-Following the favorable action of the House of Representatives,
   the Finance Committee, to whom the bill was referred, decided on prompt
   consideration of H.R. 6675. Beginning April 29, 1965, the committee
   held a total of 15 days of public hearings. During VerDate 11-MAY-2000

   HISTORY.001 SFINANC2 PsN: SFINANC2 6 that time a massive amount of
   testimony was received from proponents and opponents of the many
   provisions contained in the bill. The print- ed transcript of those
   hearings total 1,256 pages. The committee had previously considered
   similar legislation in August 1964-some 8 months prior to the 1965
   hearings. In 1964, the public hearings cov- ered 7 days and the
   transcript ran to 729 pages. Thus, in a period of less than 1 year, the
   Committee on Finance held a total of 22 days of public hearings on tile
   subject, with a printed record of almost 2,000 pages. At the conclusion
   of the public hearings, the Finance Committee held almost 3 weeks of
   executive sessions during which time it evalu- ated the testimony it
   had received and determined which provisions of the House Passed bill
   were acceptable to it, which provisions should be changed or deleted,
   and what new provisions should be added. H.R. 6675, as amended by the
   Finance Committee, was favorably re- ported to the Senate on June 30,
   1965 (S. Rept. 404). The bill was de- bated and discussed from July 6
   through July 8. Senator Russell B. Long, then the second ranking
   majority member of the Committee on Finance, served as floor manager of
   the bill during its consideration by the full Senate. In that capacity,
   it was his responsibility to defend the committee's report and views on
   the bill from attacks and amend- ments by other Senators, and to fully
   explain the committee position on the many features of this complex
   legislation. Additionally, Senator Long, after consultation with other
   members of the committee, an- nounced which amendments to the bill,
   offered on the floor of the Senate, were acceptable to the committee.
   On July 9, 1965, the amended bill was passed by the Senate by a vote of
   68 yeas to 21 nays. 4. Conference action.-H.R. 6675 as passed by the
   Senate differed in many important respects from the bill as passed by
   the House of Rep- resentatives. For this reason the floor manager of
   the bill concluded that the Senate should request a conference with the
   House in order to resolve the differences in the House and Senate
   versions of the bill. In accordance with usual procedure, the President
   of the Senate ap- pointed conferees from among the senior members of
   the Committee on Finance. Conferees are usually suggested by the
   chairman of the committee having jurisdiction over the legislation
   involved and gen- erally they comprise the senior members of the
   committee. In similar fashion, the Speaker of the House appointed
   conferees from among the senior members of the Committee on Ways and
   Means. (Of course, the House of Representatives, as is the case from
   time to time, could have accepted the Senate amendments, making a
   conference unneces- sary. Or, if the Senate had not requested a
   conference, the House could have.) The conferees were charged with

   possible-compromising only where necessary. There followed a full week
   of meetings, during which time the dif- ferences between the two Houses
   of Congress on the measure here re- solved, the House conferees
   accepting certain Senate amendments, and the Senate conferees yielding
   on others. Still others were com- promised. 5. Final action on H.R.
   6675.-The Ways and Means Committee filed the conference report,
   describing the actions taken, with the House of Representatives on July
   26, 1965. On July 27, the House agreed to the conference report by a
   vote of 307 to 116. Following an explanation and discussion of the
   conference agree- ment, the Senate approved the conference report by a
   vote of 70 to 24 on July 28, 1965. A conference report may not be
   amended but must be approved or disapproved as a whole. The purpose of
   this procedure is to avoid the possibility of interminable
   conferences-for a bill finally must he passed in identical form by both
   Houses of Congress. On July 30, 1965, the President formally approved
   H.R. 6673 at which time it became Public Law 8997. NOMINATIONS In
   addition to its legislative responsibilities, the committee has the
   responsibility of considering presidential nominations and making rec-
   ommendations to the Senate whether the nominee should be con- firmed.
   Nominations referred to the Finance Committee include: Secretary,
   Deputy Secretary, Under Secretaries, Assistant Secre- taries, and
   General Counsel of the Treasury Department; Secretary, Under Secretary,

   COMMITTEE JURISDICTION TODAY The jurisdiction of the Committee on
   Finance today encompasses vital areas which affect every American
   citizen: 1. Tax matters.-The Finance Committee has the responsibility
   for all revenue used to finance the Federal Government. This amounted
   to $666 billion in fiscal year 1984. The committee also has
   responsibility for the terms and conditions under which the Government
   borrows money. A total of $170.8 billion was borrowed from the public
   in fiscal year 1984. 2. Social Security.-The Social Security program
   which provides retire- ment, survivorship, and disability benefits for
   workers and their families involved fiscal year 1984 expenditures
   totalling $180 billion. 3. Medicare.-In fiscal year 1984, the cost of
   health insurance under the Medicare program for aged and disabled
   social security bene- ficiaries was $62 billion. 4. Supplemental
   security income.-The supplemental security income program assures all
   aged, blind, and disabled persons a minimum level of income. The cost
   of this program in fiscal year 1984 (including both the basic Federal
   benefit and certain State-funded supplementary pay- ments) was over
   $10.2 billion. 5. Family welfare programs.-In fiscal 1984, Federally
   aided welfare pro- grams for families required about $15 billion in
   Federal, State, and local costs. More than half of these costs were met
   with Federal funds. 6. Social services.-In fiscal year 1984, Federal
   financing of about $3.3 billion was provided to assist States in
   operating programs of social services, child welfare services, adoption
   assistance, foster care, and re- lated training. 7. Medicaid.-Medical
   assistance is provided for needy persons under the Medicaid program.
   Federal, State, and local costs for this program totaled $38 billion in
   fiscal year 1984. Federal funds accounted for 56 percent of this
   amount. 8. Unemployment compensation.-In fiscal year 1984, expenditures
   from the unemployment trust fund for benefits and administrative costs
   amounted to about $19.4 billion. 9. Maternal and child health.-The
   maternal and child health pro- grams are authorized in the Social
   Security Act and fall under the juris- diction of the Senate Finance
   Committee. These programs operated at a level of about $400 million in
   fiscal year 1984. 10. Revenue sharing.-For fiscal year 1984, the
   revenue sharing pro- gram provided fiscal assistance to local units of
   government totalling $4.6 billion. 11. Tariff and trade
   legislation.-The committee has the responsibility for all legislation
   affecting tariffs and import trade. The total amount of our
   international trade-imports and exports-was $559 billion in 1984.

   debt including related fiscal and monetary policy.-On Sep- tember 30,
   1984, the public debt stood at $1.57 trillion. Considered overall, the
   Finance Committee handles legislation in- volving more money than any
   other committee in the entire Congress. Each of these spheres of
   jurisdiction involves consideration of mat- ters which are often quite
   technical and detailed. Proper handling of such legislation demands
   expertise, knowledge, and skills which are the products of long
   experience. Furthermore, there are interrelationships between the
   different areas of jurisdiction which must be properly un- derstood in
   order to give adequate consideration to a given piece of legislation.
   For example, the Revenue Act of 1971 provided a system of tax in-
   centives for U.S. corporations to increase their exports, thereby
   strengthening the U.S. trade position. Additionally, tax adjustments
   must also be viewed in terms of fiscal policy-that is, how would a tax
   reduction affect the national economy? What is the relationship be-
   tween trade policy and domestic unemployment? Between social secu- rity
   benefits and payments to needy aged persons? These and other questions
   receive careful consideration in the evaluation of legislation. Though
   it is today taken for granted that the Finance Committee has
   jurisdiction over major tax, trade, and social security bills, some
   inter- esting aspects of the committee's jurisdiction seldom receive
   the spot- light. Trade.-In the years following World War II, U.S.
   customs duties were still relatively high, since classification
   determined rates of duty, it was an important question well in to the
   early 1970's, even though today such cases go to the U.S. Court of
   International Trade. However, in the 1950's and 1960's the spirit of
   tariff laws was often violated when foreign producers contrived ways of
   manipulating their products to take advantage of the letter of the law
   to fit their exports within sub- stantially lower U.S. tariff
   categories. From time to time the Finance Committee had to act to
   insure that tariff loopholes were closed so that the original
   congressional intent could be achieved. The following ex- amples serve
   to illustrate this kind of problem. Foreign textile manufacturers had
   found that by combining a small quantity of high-value flax with a
   large quantity of low-value wool (gen- erally reprocessed or reused
   wool) they could create a fabric which as 75 to 85 percent wool by
   weight. Since, however, the chief value of the fabric was flax
   (although its commercial use was as a woolen), its duty was only 10
   percent ad valorem instead of the tariff on woolens of 35 cents per
   pound plus 60 percent ad valorem-a rate more than 6 times as high. In
   1965, legislation was enacted to close this loophole. No sooner had
   this loophole been closed than a new one was de- vised. A new type of
   woolen fabric was manufactured containing small quantities of
   high-value rabbit hair and large quantities of low-value re- VerDate

   rabbit hair comprised the chief value of the fab- ric, its tariff rate
   was only 17.5 percent, rather than the much higher rates for wool
   fabrics. To deal with this new device for tariff avoidance, legislation
   was enacted in 1966. Once again the fabric was manipulated to avoid the
   high wool fabric tariffs. One method involved a combination of
   low-value wool with high-value silk in such a way that the resultant
   fabric was preponder- antly wool by weight. However, since its chief
   value was silk, it as duti- able at a rate substantially below what its
   rate would have been had its chief value been wool. Because of the
   substantial discrepancy between silk and wool tariffs, imports of the
   fabric increased from 234,000 square yards in 1965 to more than 3
   million square yards in 1966 and 1967. Once again in 1968 the Finance
   Committee initiated legislation to eliminate this loophole by assuring
   that any fabric which for prac- tical purposes is a woolen fabric will
   be subject to the duties which should apply to woolen fabrics. Evasion
   of import quotas by manipulating the product was also prev- alent in
   the case of rubber-soled footwear. In 1953 and 1954 certain footwear of
   the tennis shoe or sneaker type were imported, which, in all essential
   respects, had the characteristics of rubber-soled footwear subject to
   the high-tariff American selling price system of valuation. However, a
   strip of expensive leather had been inserted between the inner and
   outer sole of each shoe with the result that the soles of such imports
   were in chief value of leather (not rubber) and the shoes were subject
   to a lower duty. This loophole was closed in 1954. In 1955 a new
   avoidance practice was developed. It con- sisted of making the tennis
   shoe or sneaker with a tongue of high- grade leather, thereby making
   the shoe in chief value of leather again subject to a lower rate of
   duty. This practice was terminated in 1958. Legislation also was
   enacted in 1965 in order to provide uniform valuation treatment to
   imports of certain protective rubber footwear (boots, galoshes,
   rainwear, etc.). Although such footwear of natural rubber was not
   commercially distinguishable from footwear of synthetic rubber and was
   dutiable under the same provision at the same rate, the natural rubber
   footwear was dutiable on the basis of American sell- ing Price while
   synthetic rubber footwear was not-with the result that imports of the
   latter were dutiable at a lesser amount than imports of the former.
   Taxation.-Jurisdiction over tax legislation is broader than merely set-
   ting rate on income or excise taxes. The Finance Committee has han-
   dled tax legislation dealing with a variety of subjects. Some taxes are
   specifically designated in the Internal Revenue Code as ``regulatory
   taxes.'' Taxes are levied on the manufacture production, or importation
   of opium, coca leaves and opium for smoking, and also upon the transfer
   of marihuana. In addition, every person who im- VerDate 11-MAY-2000

   sells, deals in, dispenses, or gives away narcotic drugs or marihuana
   is required to register with the Treasury Department and pay a special
   occupational tax. Severe pen- alties are provided for persons failing
   to pay these marihuana, nar- cotics, or occupational taxes. Other
   regulatory taxes relate to white phosphorus matches (which are highly
   poisonous and are taxed at such a high rate that they cannot be made
   profitably), adulterated and process butter, and certain contracts for
   the sale of cotton futures. Reg- ulatory taxes are also imposed on
   average bank circulation outstanding; this tax was enacted in the Civil
   War period in order to tax State bank notes out of circulation as the
   new uniform national currency was es- tablished. An excise tax is
   levied on wagering transactions (bets), and profes- sional gamblers
   (persons who take wagers) must register with the Treasury Department
   and pay an occupational tax annually. As with, narcotics taxes, severe
   penalties are provided for wagering tax evasion. (The wagering tax has
   been weakened because of a 1967 decision of the Supreme Court which
   largely nullified this tax.) An excise tax is also imposed on sawed-off
   shotguns rifles, machine- guns, and silencers; an occupational tax is
   imposed on importers, man- ufacturers (regular or otherwise), and
   dealers handling these weapons. Many of the gangsters and mobsters of
   the 1930's were finally con- victed of violation of these regulatory
   taxes and of income tax evasion. Thus, the tax laws serve to further
   the enforcement or objective of the criminal laws of the State and
   Federal Governments. Tax law has also had direct bearing on social
   issues. Substantial tax benefits are afforded to businesses for private
   pension plans as an en- couragement for their adoption; under the
   Internal Revenue Code, the Treasury Department must insure that the
   pension plans meet certain minimuin standards for the company to
   receive the tax benefits. Work- ing parents may claim a credit for
   child care expenses: under another provision of the tax law, employers
   hiring welfare recipients may be eli- gible for a tax credit. Proposals
   for innovative ways to provide a broad base of support for political
   campaign financing have been acted on by the Senate Finance Committee
   because of their connection with tax law. This work reached fruition in
   1971, when legislation was enacted allowing a tax- payer to designate
   on his Federal income tax return if he wishes $1 of his tax to be set
   aside to help fund the next presidential election campaign. The 1976
   Presidential campaign was the first one to be paid for with public
   funds. Social Security.-Two Medicare provisions illustrate the broad
   range of areas affected by social security legislation. One of these
   provisions changed the method of paying for inpatient hospital services
   under Medicare from cost-reimbursement to one which pays prospectively

   based on the patient's diagnosis. The new system represents a major
   departure from traditional hospital payment methods. It is in- tended
   to create an incentive for hospitals to operate more efficiently by
   allowing them to retain payment amounts that exceed their costs while
   incurring losses where their costs exceed the payment. Another
   provision calls for the establishment of Professional Review Organiza-
   tions through which practicing physicians review services furnished in
   their geographic area to Medicare and, at the State's request, Medicaid
   patients. FAMOUS COMMITTEE MEMBERS With its prestige and broad
   jurisdiction, it is not surprising that many of the most famous members
   of the Senate served on the Finance Committee. Many of these Senators
   were honored on stamps and cur- rency; this document includes
   illustrations of some of these. Some years ago, the Senate charged a
   special committee chaired by Senator John F. Kennedy to select five
   outstanding Senators in U.S. his- tory. The five Senators selected had

   HISTORY.001 SFINANC2 PsN: SFINANC2 [2] THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE
   FROM ITS ORIGIN TO THE CIVIL WAR EVENTS LEADING TO THE CREATION OF THE
   FINANCE COMMITTEE The important role of the Finance Committee does not
   date from the First Congress which convened in 1789. In fact, for years
   after its establishment the Senate had no standing legislative
   committees at all. One of the very first acts of the new organized
   Senate of the First Congress was to direct a select committee of
   Senators to prepare a sys- tem of rules for conducting business in the
   Senate. The 19 rules rec- ommended by this committee were adopted by
   the Senate on April 16, 1789. One of the rules stated that ``all
   committees shall be appointed by ballot, and a plurality of votes shall
   make a choice.'' Though the rule refers to use of committees, the only
   standing com- mittees established by the Senate during its first 27
   years were basically administrative rather than legislative in
   function. Two major reasons ac- counted for this. First, the Senate was
   at that time a small body. In 1789 it began with only 20 Senators-the
   same number that serve on the Finance Committee today. Even by 1816,
   when the standing legisla- tive committees were first established, this
   number had grown to only 36 Senators. A second reason that the Senate
   was able to carry on its business ex- peditiously without recourse to
   the standing committees was that it handled a relatively small volume
   of business. In those days Senate rules made it difficult for
   individual Senators to introduce bills. The Senate rules provided a
   bill could only be introduced by a Senator after permission had been
   granted by a majority of the Senators present, and then only after 1
   day's notice had been given of his inten- tion to request such
   permission. Senators did not hesitate to deny per- mission when they
   objected to the purpose of a bill. For example, a request of Senator
   Ray Green for permission to introduce a bill repeal- ing the tax on
   stamped vellum was denied by the Senate in 1789. The result of such
   obstacles to the introduction of bills by individual Sen- (15) VerDate

   Sfmt 8461 HISTORY.002 SFINANC2 PsN: SFINANC2 16 ators was a severe
   limitation on the number of bills introduced. Only four bills were
   introduced in the Senate in the first session of the First Congress. A
   more common means of initiating legislation in the Senate was. for a
   Senator to move that a committee be appointed to report a bill
   achieving a specific goal. In this event, a committee was selected
   whose existence terminated once its specified task was completed. The
   most striking feature of the use of committees by the Senate during the
   early Congresses was its flexibility. All legislative committees during
   this period were appointed for a specific purpose; and when that
   purpose had been accomplished, the committee passed out of ex- istence.
   This meant that the number of committees named during a session was
   very large, but it also meant that the committees were directly re-
   sponsive to the will of the Senate as a whole. Since they were under
   the immediate control of the Senate, committees could be used for a
   wide variety of purposes as dictated by the needs of the moment. In
   addition to appointing committees to initiate legislation in a
   particular area, as noted above, the Senate used committees to draft
   legislation once basic policy on a particular subject was decided by
   the Senate as a whole; to study a subject and report legislation if
   desirable; to study sections of the Presidents annual message to
   Congress with instructions to report what legislation, if any, was
   required; to review petitions and memorials submitted to the Senate; to
   consider nominations for offices in the executive branch submitted by
   the President; and for such ad- ministrative purposes as preparing or
   delivering messages from the Senate to the President. These were only
   some of the uses to which committees were put; and it should be noted
   that the Senate often acted as a body on particular matters of
   legislation without the use of committees at all. As time went on, it
   became clear that a more efficient use of experi- ence and knowledge
   would have to be developed. In 1801 the Senate added to its rules the
   following: When any subject or matter shall have been referred to a
   select committee, any other subject of a similar nature may, on motion,
   be referred to such committee. This new provision of the rules had
   already been followed in prac- tice, and it was increasingly used as
   time went on. In addition, the practice developed of appointing the
   same Senators to committees dealing with similar subject matter. Thus,
   though a number of tem- porary select committees were established in
   the 13th Congress to deal with subjects of taxes, tariff duties, and
   other measures affecting the Treasury, a few Senators were repeatedly
   appointed to these commit- tees. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:50 Sep 18, 2001

   PsN: SFINANC2 17 Finally, the Senate during the 14th Congress took the
   first formal step leading to the development of standing committees as
   we know them today. On Tuesday, December 5, 1815, President Madison
   deliv- ered his annual message to the Congress. On Friday, December 8,
   Sen- ator Bibb of Georgia submitted a series of motions to refer parts
   of the President's message to various select committees. One of his
   motions was recorded in the Senate Journal as follows: (Resolved, That
   so much of the message of the President of the United States, as
   relates to finance and an uniform national currency. be referred to a
   select committee, with leave to report by bill or other- wise. The
   Annals of Congress record that on the following Monday- Appointed to
   the committee were Senators Campbell (chairman, Tennessee), Chace
   (Vermont), Bibb (Georgia), King (New York), and Mason (New Hampshire).
   It had not been uncommon before this for portions of the Presi- dent's
   annual message to be referred to select committees for consider- ation
   and recommendations of appropriate action. But the select com- mittees
   created previously had been dissolved upon completion of their
   immediate task. The select committees of the 14th Congress, first ses-
   sion, however, were utilized throughout the session for a variety of
   leg- islative measures. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:50 Sep 18, 2001 Jkt

   SFINANC2 18 Though the new Committee on Finance and an Uniform National
   Currency (as it was subsequently referred to) remained a select, and
   theoretically temporary, committee, it soon proved its mettle by han-
   dling the two most important legislative measures enacted by the 14th
   Congress: the Tariff Act of 1816 and the Bank Act. Some background is
   necessary to appreciate the significance of these two acts. The War of
   1812 had left U.S. finances in a chaotic state. Expendi- tures had
   risen sharply because of the war, but customs revenues, which had
   represented 90 percent of Federal income, were cut in half by the drop
   in trade during the war. Excise taxes were levied too late to be a
   significant source of income during the war. As a result, the national
   debt, which had declined from $81 million to $45 million be- tween 1801
   and 1811, almost tripled to $127 million by 1815. In addition, the
   charter of the United States Bank had been allowed to expire in 1811.
   The Bank had issued uniform currency, acted as a depository for Federal
   funds, and cooperated closely with the Treasury in attempting to
   stabilize the money market and protect the banking system. With the
   United States Bank defunct, the war years saw a tre- mendous growth in
   State-chartered banks, each issuing its own notes. Since Government
   spending was very heavy and taxes were not im- posed, price inflation
   resulted. Soon the public lost its faith in bank notes and attempted to
   redeem them. The banks themselves refused to accept bank notes from
   banks chartered by other States. After the summer of 1814, the entire
   U.S. banking and currency system broke down. For practical purposes,
   much of the Treasury's revenue was use- less, since it was collected in
   State bank notes which were not accepted in other States. Faced with
   this situation, President Madison, in his annual message to the
   Congress delivered December 181 urged the Congress ``that the benefits
   of an uniform national currency should be restored to the
   community''-if necessary, through the reestablishment of a national
   hank. The President also suggested that tariffs be raised both to in-
   crease Federal revenues and to protect infant industry in the United
   States. On March 15, 1816, the House sent to the Senate ``An Act to
   incor- porate the subscribers to the Bank of the United States;'' the
   bill was ``referred to the Committee on Finance and an Uniform National
   Cur- rency.'' The committee reported the bill one week later, and
   following Senate passage, the House accepted the Senate amendments and
   sent the bill to President Madison for his approval on April 10. The
   act chartered a national bank for 20 years, with the Government
   providing one-fifth of the capital; notes of the Bank were acceptable
   in payment of all public debts. The Bank Act ended the chaotic fiscal
   situation of the prior 5 years. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:50 Sep 18, 2001

   PsN: SFINANC2 19 On April 9, 1816, the Senate received from the House
   ``An act to regulate the duties on imports and tonnage.'' Although the
   section of the President's message dealing with tariffs had been
   referred to a Se- lect Committee on Manufactures, the House-passed
   Tariff Act of 1816 was referred to the Committee on Finance and an
   Uniform National Currency. The bill was reported by the committee
   shortly and, fol- lowing House concurrence in the Senate amendments,
   was signed into law on April 26. This bill served as the basic U.S.
   tariff law for the fol- lowing 8 years. Thus did the nascent Finance
   Committee achieve its first two legisla- tive landmarks. But the
   committee handled other issues as well, of a different character. For
   example, in 1816 there had been referred to the committee a memorial of
   the Bible Society of Philadelphia praying ``that a law may be passed
   exempting from duty such stereotype edi- tions of the sacred
   scriptures, and such Bibles and Testaments in for- eign languages, as
   may be hereafter imported into the United States from foreign countries
   by Bible societies.'' In one of its first printed reports, the Finance
   Committee states its appreciation of the ``laudable efforts of the
   Bible societies to disseminate the knowledge of the sacred scriptures
   among the various classes of society in different countries;'' however,
   the committee felt that exemption from duty of Bibles im- ported by
   Bible societies ``might have the effect of preventing or dis- couraging
   the importation of those kinds of books by other descrip- tions of
   persons, and might also discourage the printing them in our own
   country.'' The committee therefore recommended that the re- quest not
   be granted. At the beginning of the second session of the 14th
   Congress, in De- cember 1816, following the delivery of President
   Madison's annual message, Senator Sanford of New York offered a set of
   motions to refer parts of the message to select committees, as had been
   done in 1815. But this time, no action was taken on these motions.
   Instead, the fol- lowing day Senator Barbour of Virginia offered a
   motion to establish specified standing committees as part of the Senate
   rules. Senator Barbour's motion was approved, and on December 10, 1816,
   the Com- mittee on Finance was established as a standing committee of
   the Sen- ate. Three days later, its members were appointed: Senators
   Campbell (chairman, Tennessee), Mason (New Hampshire), Thompson (New
   Hampshire), King (New York), and Troup (Georgia). Three of its members,
   including the chairman, had served on the Select Committee on Finance
   and an Uniform National Currency; Senator Bibb of Geor- gia, a member
   of the previous year's select committee, had resigned at the end of the
   first session. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:50 Sep 18, 2001 Jkt 072962 PO

   20 SELECTION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN THE SENATE The Senate had in 1789
   adopted the rule that ``all committees shall be appointed by ballot,
   and a plurality of votes shall make a choice.'' The significance of
   this rule took on a new dimension with the estab- lishment of standing
   committees. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:50 Sep 18, 2001 Jkt 072962 PO 00000

   first, the choice of committee chairmen and members continued to be by
   ballot of the whole Senate. But this system led to embarrassing
   situations. In 1816, three of the five members of the Finance Com-
   mittee were members of the minority' Federalist Party, though the
   chairman was a Democrat; in the first session of the 24th Congress,
   Chairman Daniel Webster and two other members of the five-man Fi- nance
   Committee were members of the minority Whig Party. In the 17th and 21st
   Congresses, the entire membership of the Finance Com- mittee was of the
   majority party. In 1823, Senator Eaton proposed that the chairmen of
   the Finance Committee and four other major committees be selected by
   ballot, and that these five chairmen select the remaining members of
   all standing committees. After consideration of this proposal, the
   Senate voted in- stead to amend the rules to provide that all
   committees ``shall be ap- pointed by the presiding officer of this
   House, unless otherwise or- dered by the Senate.'' Since Vice President
   Tompkins virtually never attended Senate sessions, it was the President
   pro tempore, an officer chosen by and responsible to the Senate, who
   made the appointments. But the next Vice President, John Calhoun, was a
   political enemy of President John Quincy Adams. Exercising his function
   as Presiding Of- ficer of the Senate, in 1826 he appointed to the
   Finance Committee only one Senator not hostile to the Adams
   administration. In view of the strong political nature of these and
   other committee assignments by the Vice President, the Senate, whose
   majority supported the Presi- dent, soon stripped the Vice President of
   the power to appoint com- mittees and restored the original rule of
   committee choice by ballot. In 1826, the procedure was also adopted of
   appointing committee chairmen separately by majority vote, and then
   voting by one ballot for the remaining committee members. But this too
   proved unsatisfactory since the ranking committee member by this method
   would often be a member of the minority party, who would head the
   committee in the event of the chairman's absence. In the following
   dozen years the Senate experimented with various ways of dealing with
   the problem, aiming always for a solution which would enable the parent
   body to keep some control over committee appointments while avoiding
   the capricious results that sometimes fol- lowed from the timeconsuming
   balloting procedure. In 1846, the Senate finally adopted the method of
   committee selec- tion which has been followed to this day: the parties
   selected the com- mittee chairmen and members, and the resulting lists
   were approved by the Senate as a whole. The method of choosing the
   committee chairman also underwent modification. Senator William Maclay,
   a member of the select com- mittee appointed in 1789 to recommend the
   Senate's first set of rules, proposed that the chairman of each
   committee ``shall be the Senator VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:50 Sep 18, 2001

   PsN: SFINANC2 22 from the most northerly State of those from whom the
   committee is taken.'' The proposal was not even considered. In fact,
   for its first 37 years the Senate rules made no provision for choice of
   committee chairman. Jefferson's Manual of Senate Procedure (compiled
   during his Vice Presidency) merely states that ``The person first named
   is gen- erally permitted to act as chairman. But this is a matter of
   courtesy, every committee having a right to elect their own chairman
   who pre- sides over them, puts questions, and reports their
   proceedings.'' In 1808, John Quincy Adams declared it to be the
   Senate's prevailing practice that ``the member having the greatest
   number of votes is first named, and as such is Chairman.'' But this was
   before the standing legislative committees were created. Only after
   their creation did the chairmanship begin to assume the sig- nificant
   role characteristic of a later period. Eventually, after the kind of
   experimentation noted above, chairmanship was decided on the basis of
   party and committee seniority, as it is today. THE FINANCE COMMITTEE
   FROM ITS CREATION TO THE CIVIL WAR The Finance Committee had well shown
   its value to the Senate by its activity during the first session of the
   14th Congress. But the stand- ing committees did not immediately assume
   the role they have today. Today, with extremely rare exceptions, every
   bill in the Senate is re- ferred to one of the standing committees; the
   jurisdiction of each com- mittee is set forth explicitly in the Senate
   rules. In 1816 and the ensuing decades, the Senate had not fully
   decided on the way it was to use its standing committees. In the early
   years after the Finance Committee's establishment, referral of bills to
   committees was determined by motions on the Senate floor. Sometimes
   bills deal- ing with similar subject matter were referred to different
   committees; sometimes temporary select committees were created to deal
   with par- ticular legislation (as had been done before the standing
   committees were created); often, bills were considered directly on the
   Senate floor without recourse to committees at all. Tariff
   measures.-Though the Finance Committee had handled the Tariff Act of
   1816, it was years before its authority over all tariff bills was
   recognized. The sections of the 1815 President's message dealing with
   tariffs had been referred to a Select Committee on Manufactures. This
   committee became the standing Committee on Commerce and Manufactures in
   December 1816; its membership in the second session of the 14th
   Congress was limited to Senators from Rhode Island, New Hampshire, New
   York, and Pennsylvania. Given its composition: it was naturally
   sympathetic to raising tariffs to protect American industry. Proponents
   of high tariffs argued that their purpose was not pri- marily to raise
   revenues, but rather to protect American industry: and VerDate

   certain goods are raised high enough, revenue ceases since legal
   importation of those goods stops. Be that as it may, protectionists
   were partially successful in diverting some tariff bills to the
   sympathetic Committee on Commerce and Manufactures. In 1816, two out of
   the four tariff bills introduced in the Senate or passed by the House
   were referred to the Committee on Commerce and Manu- factures, while
   the Finance Committee received two; for the next 10 years, no
   significant tariff bill was referred to the Finance Committee. A
   distinction was apparently made between tariff measures for revenue
   purposes only (such as the duty on salt), which were referred to the
   Finance Committee, and tariff measures on manufactured goods for the
   purpose of protection, which were referred to the other com- mittee.
   But even this rule of thumb often was not followed, and in a number of
   cases tariff bills were directly considered on the Senate floor without
   referral to either committee. The conflict over jurisdiction is shown
   in Senate action on the House bill that was to become the protectionist
   Tariff Act of 1824. When the bill was sent to the Senate following
   House passage, Senator Lloyd of Maryland (who did not serve on either
   the Finance Com- mittee or the Committee on Commerce and Manufactures)
   moved to refer the bill to the Finance Committee on the grounds that it
   would have a profound effect on the finances of the country. This
   motion gave rise to considerable discussion on the propriety of such a
   referral, and opponents of the motion contended that the subject
   properly be- longed to the Committee on Commerce and. Manufactures. A
   vote was taken, and the motion to refer the bill to the Finance
   Committee was defeated, 23 to 22. It was then referred to the Committee
   on Com- merce and Manufactures. An even more protective tariff law,
   called the ``Tariff of Abomina- tions,'' was enacted in 1828. But the
   Committee on Manufactures, with its extreme protectionist sentiments,
   was not able to maintain its juris- diction over tariff matters. In
   1833, Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky (who was not yet a member of the
   Committee on Finance) introduced his ``Compromise Tariff'' bill to
   reduce tariffs. Senator Dickerson of New Jersey, chairman of the
   Committee on Manufactures, moved that the bill be referred to his
   committee. Senator Grundy of Tennessee recommended instead that a
   seven-member special committee, chosen from different parts of the
   country, be set up under Clay's chairmanship to deal with this ``meas-
   ure introduced in a spirit of conciliation and harmony, with a view to
   the settlement of the dangerous collisions of opinions which exist be-
   tween different sections of the country. The motion to refer the bill
   to the Committee on Manufactures was defeated by a vote of 26 to 12,
   and the special committee was appointed under Clay's chairmanship.

   25 This vote of no confidence proved a turning point in jurisdiction
   over tariff bills. Beginning in 1834, all tariff bills were referred
   initially to the Finance Committee. The important Tariff Act of 1842
   was han- dled by the Finance Committee, as were a number of minor bills
   in the decade following the Compromise Tariff of 1833. In 1846, a bill
   to reduce tariffs was passed by the House and sent to the Senate on
   July 6. The Senate leaders wished to take the bill up on the Senate
   floor immediately; a motion to refer it first to the Fi- nance
   Committee was narrowly defeated. 24 to 22. After 6 weeks of floor
