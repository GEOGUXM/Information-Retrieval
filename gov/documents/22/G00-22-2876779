   The goal of automated software engineering is to increase by orders of
   magnitude both the quality and the productivity of software
   engineering. The cross-cutting research done by the Automated Software
   Engineering group of Code IC at NASA Ames draws upon several
   disciplines including: Artificial Intelligence - particularly automated
   reasoning and knowledge representation; Formal Methods; programming
   language theory; mathematical logic; and advanced compiler methods. Our
   focus is on strategic research - research that is directed to the 5 -
   15 year time horizon, aiming to make large impacts rather than
   incremental advances. Our research is done in the context of pacing
   NASA applications, as a means of both providing us feedback as we
   progress and as a means of making contributions to NASA's goals as we
   progress. We currently have space-related projects in space science
   code generation, software verification for deep-space missions. For
   civilian aviation, we are engaged in research on next-generation
   autocoding technology, and high-assurance software design. We are also
   developing innovative educational technology, and have some sample
   lessons for students and teachers based on work done so far.
