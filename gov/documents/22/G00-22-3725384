   What is the SSDS?
   The Space Science Data System is the confederation of groups supported
   by NASA's Office of Space Science to provide public access to and to
   ensure the usability of science data from OSS missions and selected
   other data. Some SSDS groups develop tools and services for finding and
   using these data. Long-term data accessibility is ensured by SSDS
   archiving and preservation of the data.

   Who are SSDS' customers?
   The SSDS customer community ranges from the NASA and international
   space science research communities to students, educators and the
   general public.
