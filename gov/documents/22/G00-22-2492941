   e-File W-2s to SSA
   File your W-2 reports electronically by using SSA's Employer Services
   Online link. Just register with SSA for a PIN and Password and you'll
   be ready to e-File.

    1. Submitters filing under the MMREF format can e-File their W2REPORT
       instead of creating magnetic media to mail to SSA.
    2. Submitters filing fewer than 10 W-2s can complete the forms right
       on their personal computer.

   It's Just That Simple!
