   Wildland fires are an important ecosystem process throughout the
   western United States. Coniferous forests have long been subject to a
   frequent fire regime of low-intensity fires, which played an important
   role in reducing hazardous fuels and in rejuvenating the forests. In
   chaparral shrublands of California, high-intensity crown fires have
   been a strong force guiding the evolution of plant life, and regulator
   of ecological communities. In many desert habitats, fires have been far
   less frequent, and often are a more severe disturbance. Today the
   natural role of fire in these ecosystems is complicated by the fact
   that fire potentially favors plant invasions and these aliens in turn
   may alter fire regimes.

   To restore more normal fire dynamics to a particular region, managers
   need to know how fire has historically affected the local system, and
   how it functions today. Researchers at the Western Ecological Research
   Center (WERC) are making contributions to this effort through detailed
   studies of fire history and fire ecology in the Sierra Nevada forests,
   the California shrublands, and the Mojave and Sonoran deserts.
   Knowledge from these studies is forming the basis for new policies
   aimed at restoring fire cycles that will present a lower risk to human
   life and property, and help safeguard the stability and diversity of
   Pacific Southwest ecosystems.

   WERC research is being conducted in the Sierra Nevada forests, the
   California shrublands, and the Mojave and Sonoran deserts.
