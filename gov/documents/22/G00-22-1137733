   About the Library
   The Department of Labor Library, established in 1917, is one of the
   oldest Cabinet-level libraries. Large segments of its collection -
   which document the history of labor, labor unions and the growth and
   development of the labor movement in a national and world context --
   are unique either in their nature and content or in the length and
   completeness of their coverage.

   The Library's role as information repository and access point is
   central in supporting the day-to-day regulatory, monitoring and
   analytical work of the Department. To accomplish this, the Library is
   moving toward the virtual environment, delivering information to
   Departmental officers and staff at their desktops. The Library's large
   journal collection is predominantly historic. Enterprise licenses with
   individual publishers make their titles available electronically to the
   Library's users. The Library's online catalog comprises approximately
   67,000 titles. All catalog records, however, have not been converted to
   electronic format and a card catalog still provides access to most
   holdings acquired prior to 1975, almost 248,000 records.

   On March 28, 2000 the Library was dedicated in honor of former
   Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz and Mrs. Jane Wirtz to become the
   Wirtz Labor Library of the United States Department of Labor. In the
   same year, the Library was designated a Millennium Library by the White
   House Millennium Council in recognition of its unique historical
   holdings.
