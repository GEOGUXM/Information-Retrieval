   IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR VIEWING YOUR OFFICIAL PERSONNEL FOLDER (OPF) VIA
                                  THE INTERNET!

                   Updated Windows 2000 information 09/11/2000
                         Updated MAC information 11/8/99

   Print a copy of these instructions to have by your computer the first
   time you try to view your OPF!

                  DO NOT USE THE ADOBE ACROBAT READER!!!!!!

   In order to view the documents contained in your OPF you must take
   certain actions on your computer that let it know how to deal with the
   images that make up your file. These steps will differ if you are using
   a Windows based computer or an Apple computer.

   For Windows based computers ,  an image viewer has been provided as
   part of the operating system since the second release of Windows 95.
   What we need to do is tell your computer to use this program when
   viewing your online OPF.

   First you need to get to the part of the website that will permit you
   to view your OPF by selecting the "Officer & Liaison Activities Area".
   Log in using the ID and Password previously provided (this part of the
   website is secure).  A new button will allow you to select the option
   of accessing your OPF.  You will have to accept the Privacy Act
   conditions then will be given several options to select.  Click on the
   View OPF option.  The next choice will permit viewing the entire OPF,
   or a subset.  Selecting "entire OPF" will generate a list of all
   documents indexed in your OPF. This can be printed and will provide a
   convenient Table of Contents view of your OPF.  Clicking on any of the
   document links will take you to a screen with more information and
   links to the individual images that make up each document. (Please
   note: I am working on a way to combine images, but it is not yet
   ready.) Now comes the "tricky" part.

    For Internet Explorer: When you click on the link that says "Click to
   view Document Page x" a dialog box should open up on your screen asking
      you what to do with the file; either open it up from its current
     location or save it. Click on open from current location.  Now the
   computer wants to know what to use to open the file. A box will open on
     the screen asking you what program to use to open the image. Choose
      "other" (a button on the lower right side of that box). Enter the
             appropriate information for your operating system:

                              For Windows2000:

        C:\Program Files\Windows NT\Accessories\ImageVue\kodakimg.exe

                               For WindowsNT :

        C:\Program Files\Windows NT\Accessories\Imagevue\wangimg.exe

                              For Windows 98 :

                           C:\Windows\kodakimg.exe

      For Windows 95 SR2:  C:\windows\wangimg.exe  EARLIER VERSIONS OF
                       WINDOWS 95 --- SEE NOTE BELOW!

       MAKE SURE YOU ENTER THE ABOVE PATHS EXACTLY AS THEY ARE SHOWN!

   After you enter the information, click on "open".  Make sure the box
   that says "Always use this program to open this type of file" is
   checked then click OK.  This should allow you to view the image.  When
   you are done looking at that particular image, close the viewer. When
   you click on another link to view an image, you will get the "what do
   you want to do" box again --- this should be the last time. Click on
   open from current location, and UNCLICK THE BOX THAT SAYS "ASK BEFORE
   OPENING FILES OF THIS TYPE".  This should open the image. From now on,
   when you click on an image link, it will automatically open the viewer.

   For Netscape Navigator:  The process is basically the same with the
   following exception. Netscape will open a box that says "UNKNOWN FILE
   TYPE"  and ask what you want to do. Click on "Pick App....". In the
   next box, type the path information for your operating system from
   above and click OK. The next screen asks if you want to open it, or
   save it to disk.  Select "open it" and UNCHECK THE ALWAYS ASK BEFORE
   OPENING THIS TYPE OF FILE BOX". Then click OK.

   If you have an earlier version of Windows 95 , you can download the
   image viewer from the Microsoft website. Use the "keyword" search and
   look for the word IMAGING for Windows 95. Follow the posted
   instructions to install the viewer.  I don't know of a free viewer for
   Windows 3.1.

   For MAC Computers :  I have not been able to get my hands on an Apple
   computer, but I expect the browsers to work the same way. If you have
   one and can provide me with instructions that work, please send them to
   me.  The Imaging viewer available from NIH that I mentioned before will
   NOT work with these images.  However, folks there (who corrected my
   assumption -- thanks Newlin) have indicated that a program called
   "Graphic Converter" worked.  From Bev Wilcox (thanks for the info) a
   search of Version Tracker (http://www.versiontracker.com ) is a way to
   find Graphic Converter.  Also, a search of Altavista
   (http://www.altavista.com) using the phrase "graphic converter" listed
   several sources for the program. Again, please let me know.  Send email
   to  dcphelpdesk@psc.gov
