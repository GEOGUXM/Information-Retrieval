   Information For Small Biotech Companies

   Numerous small biotech companies have emerged in recent years in an
   effort to research the potentially large number of new drug targets
   arising from advances in molecular biology. These firms often are very
   knowledgeable of the basic science pertaining to their respective areas
   of expertise, but they often have less expertise in other aspects of
   drug development and clinical trials design, or they may not have
   facile access to large chemical libraries or high throughput screens.
   Small biotech companies have access to our discovery services including
   repositories, screening, and with an academic partner, the Rapid Access
   to NCI Discovery Resources (R·A·N·D). They may also access our
   development services: Rapid Access to Intervention Development (RAID)
   (with an academic collaborator) and the Drug Development Group (DDG).
   Furthermore, NCI offers small business funding opportunities.

   While forging an alliance with a larger corporate entity is certainly
   one means to drug development resources, working with NCI offers the
   ability to minimize the risk of development costs while assuring that
   the most scientifically meritorious approaches find the most rapid
   route to enter clinical trials. NCI is not ultimately in the business
   of marketing drugs, but its development process and clinical trials
   network, like funded grants, can allow a product to become more
   attractive to the private sector to manufacture and develop into a New
   Drug Application (NDA).
