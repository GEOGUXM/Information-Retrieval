   ASSIST: This Guide is designed to assist you if (i) you want to file a
   lawsuit in federal court or you have an active role, either as a
   plaintiff or defendant, in a case that you or someone else has filed
   already in federal court, and (ii) you have elected to proceed without
   assistance of a trained and licensed attorney. SOME BASIC DEFINITIONS:
   Plaintiffs and defendants in court cases generally are referred to as
   the "parties" or "litigants." The plaintiff asserts a claim or right
   protected by law against the defendant; the defendant denies the claim
   or right, and the court determines whether the asserted claims or
   rights have merit. The great majority of litigants who appear in this
   court are represented by an attorney who has been trained in the law
   and is familiar with the applicable court rules and procedures. Parties
   or litigants who are not represented by licensed attorneys and who
   elect to represent themselves generally are referred to as pro se
   parties or pro se litigants. Likewise, plaintiffs or defendants who
   represent themselves generally are referred to as pro se plaintiffs or
   pro se defendants. HOW THIS GUIDE WAS DESIGNED TO HELP YOU: This Guide
   will not answer all your questions about what you need to do to
   represent yourself effectively as a pro se litigant. The Guide outlines
   the basic steps that are required to properly file an action, or
   lawsuit, with this court. It also provides some general guidance on the
   next steps in the process of litigating the action once you have filed
   it with the Clerk of Court. However, you are responsible for learning
   about and following the procedures that govern the court process.
   Although the staff of the clerk's office can provide pro se litigants
   with general information concerning court rules and procedures, they
   are forbidden as a matter of law from providing legal advice, from
   interpreting and applying court rules, or otherwise participating,
   directly or indirectly, in any action. In addition, the judges of this
   court cannot give you legal advice since they will ultimately be
   charged with ruling on motions submitted by the plaintiff and defendant
   and with trying the case with or without a jury. A WORD OF ADVICE:
   Self-representation carries certain responsibilities and risks pro se
   litigants should be aware of before they proceed. The court encourages
   all individuals who are considering pro se or self-representation to
   carefully review the risks associated with self- representation and to
   educate themselves regarding potential consequences. WARNING: Rule 11
   of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure prohibits filing of lawsuits
   that are clearly frivolous or filed merely to harass an individual. If
   after reviewing your complaint, the court determines that you have
   filed a lawsuit for an improper or clearly unnecessary purpose, it may
   impose sanctions against you, including ordering you to pay a fine to
   the court or pay legal fees of the person or persons against whom you
   filed the law suit. In certain types of cases, such as employment
   discrimination cases, if you lose, you may be required to pay the legal
   fees of the winning party. In all cases, if you lose, you may be
   required to pay some of the costs the winning party incurred in the
   course of the lawsuit. 3 SECTION I **** IMPORTANT ISSUES YOU SHOULD
   CONSIDER BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO REPRESENT YOURSELF IN AN ACTION BEFORE
   THIS COURT A. IS THIS COURT THE APPROPRIATE COURT TO HEAR YOUR DISPUTE?
   The United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia is
   one of 94 trial courts in the federal court system. Federal courts can
   only hear limited kinds of cases. As is the case in all federal trial
   courts, this court is authorized only to hear disputes that fall into
   the following four categories: 1. Those that deal with a question
   involving the United States Constitution; 2. Those that involve
   questions of federal law (as opposed to state law); 3. Those that
   involve the United States of America as a party, whether plaintiff or
   defendant; and, 4 Those that involve a dispute among residents of
   different states with an amount in controversy over $75,000. If your
   complaint does not fall under any of these categories, you should not
   file it in this court. B. IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE TO APPEARING PRO SE
   (REPRESENTING YOURSELF) THAT IS AFFORDABLE? Most people who file and
   pursue litigation in the federal court employ a licensed attorney who
   practices law, has appeared in court, and is familiar with the rules of
   procedure that govern court processes. Some attorneys are willing to
   accept your case on a contingency basis where they would receive an
   agreed upon percentage amount for their fee if you win your case and
   nothing if you do not prevail. There are provisions under some laws
   that require the other side to pay for your attorney should you win
   your case. Most attorneys are careful when screening cases before
   agreeing to accept them in order to make sure potential clients have a
   viable chance for winning a case which would allow them to collect a
   fee. If an attorney rejects your case, reasons for such action could be
   based on 4 considerations such as: (1) There may be no merit to your
   case; (2) You may not be able to prove anyone liable for wrong done to
   you; (3) The wrong done to you may not be severe enough to warrant
   monetary damages; (4) You have no witnesses; or, (5) Your witnesses are
   not credible. If you would prefer to have an attorney to represent you
   but are unable to retain one who will take your case on a contingency
   basis or you simply cannot afford to pay high hourly fees, you may want
   to consider contacting Georgia Legal Services whose staff can explain
   the various options for obtaining and paying for legal services. If you
   are unable to find an attorney to represent you, you have the right to
   pursue your claim(s) in the court by appearing without representation
   or pro se, a Latin phrase meaning "for yourself." Bear in mind that as
   a pro se litigant, you are representing only yourself and presenting
   only your claims and defenses. Under the law, you cannot speak for
   another person, a company, or other entity such as a club or
   association that includes other individuals. When you appear pro se,
   you must follow the same rules and procedu.160y.008c.00 0.00160yD

   WITH YOUR CASE A. HOW DO YOU GET YOUR CASE ESTABLISHED IN OUR COURT?
   Preparing Your Complaint: The plaintiff or person bringing the lawsuit
   to court files a complaint. The complaint outlines a problem or reason
   for the lawsuit, also known as a cause of action. When preparing your
   complaint, you should use 8 ½" x 11" (letter size) paper. The contents
   should include the following: (1) A short and plain statement of the
   grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends, unless the court
   already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new grounds of
   jurisdiction to support it. (2) A short and plain statement of the
   claim showing that you are entitled to relief; and, (3) A demand for
   judgment for the relief to which you deem yourself entitled. The
   complaint (and any other type of pleadings that are filed such as
   motions, etc.) should contain a caption setting forth the name of the
   court, the title of the action, the case number (if already assigned),
   and a designation such as "Complaint", etc. Refer to Appendix A for the
   proper format. In setting forth your claim against defendants, you are
   only required to state exactly what happened by stating facts, not
   conclusions, and what relief you want. For example, a complaint setting
   forth conclusions might read: "The Commissioner of the Social Security
   Administration denied me my right to Social Security benefits."
   whereas, a complaint setting forth facts would read: "The Commissioner
   of the Social Security Administration issued an unfavorable decision on
   July 27, 1997." Your statement of claim should not contain legal
   argument or citations of cases. However, 6 these may be submitted
   separately from the complaint if desired. You should clearly identify
   all defendants by name and address and it is your responsibility to
   determine the identity of any and all defendants you wish to sue. It is
   usual for the name of one or more defendants to be unknown at the time
   of filing the complaint. Frequently, plaintiffs will identify a
   defendant by name of "John Doe" or "Jane Doe". If, after your case has
   been filed, you determine the proper name of a defendant previously
   identified as "John Doe" or "Jane Doe", you should file a Motion to
   Amend your complaint, stating the correct name (and address) of any
   such defendant. Check to see that you have included all relevant names,
   addresses, and dates in your complaint. You may attach as an exhibit
   any written instrument you have referred to in your complaint which you
   would like to make a part of the complaint. You must sign the complaint
   and state your address and phone number. If there is more than one
   plaintiff, each must sign the complaint as well as all future
   pleadings. Filing Your Complaint: Generally, you may file a civil case
   in the district where any defendant resides or where the claim arose
   (see 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (Venue generally)). As to which of the six
   divisions within this district that you should choose to file in, the
   choice belongs to the plaintiff. According to Local Rule 3.4, a
   plaintiff may file a civil case in the division in which the plaintiff
   resides, the defendant resides, or the claim arose. To help you
   determine which division your case would be filed in, the following
   information is provided. The U.S. District Court for the Middle
   District of Georgia is geographically divided into six divisions:
   Albany, Athens, Columbus, Macon, Thomasville, and Valdosta. Thomasville
   is staffed and opens only when court is in session so you would not be
   able to deliver your lawsuit or any other pleadings to that office for
   filing; rather, they should be filed in the Valdosta division since all
   Thomasville case files are maintained by that office. Division offices
   in this district and associated counties for each are: (1) Albany
   Division: Baker, Ben Hill, Calhoun, Crisp, Dougherty, Early, Lee,
   Miller, Mitchell, Schley, Sumter, Terrell, Turner, Worth, and Webster;
   (2) Athens Division: Clarke, Elbert, Franklin, Greene, Hart, Madison,
   Morgan, Oconee, Oglethorpe, and Walton; (3) Columbus Division:
   Chattahoochee, Clay, Harris, Marion, Muscogee, Quitman, Randolph,
   Stewart, Talbot, and Taylor; (4) Macon Division: Baldwin, Bibb,
   Bleckley, Butts, Crawford, Dooly, Hancock, Houston, Jasper, Jones,
   Lamar, Macon, Monroe, Peach, Pulaski, Putnam, Twiggs, Upson,
   Washington, Wilcox, and Wilkinson; 7 (5) Thomasville Division: Brooks,
   Colquitt, Decatur, Grady, Seminole, and Thomas; and, (6) Valdosta
   Division: Berrien, Clinch, Cook, Echols, Irwin, Lanier, Lowndes, and
   Tift. You can file your complaint by hand-delivering it or mailing it
   to the Clerk's Office. Street and post office box addresses and phone
   numbers for each office are: U.S. District Court U.S. District Court

   (229)242-3616 Whether you deliver or mail your complaint to the court,
   you must submit: (i) an original and one copy of the complaint, (ii) a
   completed cover sheet (blank forms can be obtained from the clerk's
   office or from our court's Internet web site at www.gamd.uscourts.gov)
   and (iii) the $150.00 filing fee (unless you are proceeding in forma
   pauperis as discussed on Page 13 of this guide). Although pleadings and
   papers may be filed in any divisional Clerk's Office within this
   district, it is recommended that they be filed in the divisional office
   in which the case file will be maintained as indicated above. Once
   received in the Clerk's Office, the complaint is given a case number
   and assigned to a district judge. Service of Your Complaint: Each
   defendant or person whom the plaintiff claims is responsible for the
   problem must be notified of the lawsuit through a process that is
   specified by law. The responsibility for notifying each defendant rests
   with the plaintiff and is referred to as service of process. Detailed
   instructions for service of process are described in Rule 4 of the
   Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; you should carefully review this rule
   to make sure you are familiar with these instructions. If these service
   of process requirements are not followed correctly, the case can be
   dismissed for failure to effect proper service. 8 As described in Rule
   4, service of process requirements can be satisfied in one of three
   ways: (1) Personal Service - Using this method, you direct someone else
   to deliver or serve a copy of the complaint and summons on the
   defendant(s). Such service can be performed by anyone who is over
   eighteen years of age and who is not a party named in the case. Private
   process servers will do this for a fee. The standard summons form can
   be obtained from the Clerk's Office or this court's web site at
   www.gamd.uscourts.gov and it must be completed by you. After you have
   completed the form, staff of the Clerk's Office officially issue the
   summons which means that an authorized court employee will sign the
   form and emboss it with the official seal of the court. Both the
   summons and the complaint are then served on the defendant. The person
   who serves the summons must record on the back of the summons form his
   or her name, the name of the person who was served, and the date and
   time of service. This section of the summons form is referred to as the
   return of service, and if not completed, service of process is not
   complete. Rule 4 requires confirmation that service has been completed.
   Such confirmation or proof that the documents have been served on the
   defendant(s) requires that the original summons form with the return of
   service completed be returned to the court and that a copy of the form
   be left with the defendant(s). (2) Waiver of Service - Rule 4 permits a
   defendant to waive personal service of process. This means the
   defendant agrees to respond to your complaint without being personally
   served with a copy of it. The Clerk's Office can provide you a waiver
   form you can mail to the defendant along with the complaint.
   Alternatively, you can obtain the form from the court's web site at
   www.gamd.uscourts.gov. If the defendant completes and returns the
   waiver, you will be spared the burden of personal service as described
   above. (3) Service by the U.S. Marshal - If a judge approves your
   application for waiver of the requirement to pay the $150 case filing
   fee as described in Section IV of this guide, and otherwise determines
   that your case should go forward, the judge will direct the U.S.
   Marshal to serve the summons and complaint at government expense. After
   you file your complaint with the Clerk's Office, you have 120 days to
   serve a copy of it and the summons on the defendant(s). It is your
   responsibility to effect service; if you fail to do so within the 120
   days, your case may be dismissed. IMPORTANT NOTE: Although a judge may
   order that a defendant be served with process, it may be several weeks
   from the date of the order directing service before service is
   complete. When a judge orders that a defendant be served, typically the
   order will only require that a copy of the complaint and a waiver of
   service form be mailed to the defendant's last known address (as
   provided by the plaintiff). If a defendant refuses to waive service,
   even though a waiver of service form is sent to him/her, that defendant
   must then be served by personal service. 9 B. WHAT HAPPENS ONCE THE
   DEFENDANT(S) HAS BEEN SERVED? Once the defendant(s) has been served
   with a copy of the complaint, the defendant(s) must file with the court
   an answer or some response within a specified number of days. Under the
   rules governing service of process, each defendant is required to
   provide a copy of the response to the plaintiff. Once each defendant
   named in the lawsuit has filed a response, the case is considered to be
   at issue. C. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A CASE IS AT ISSUE? Once the case is at
   issue, any one of a number of different actions may occur which
   include: Referral to a U.S. Magistrate Judge: As set forth in the
   court's Local Rules, the district judge to whom the case is assigned
   may refer the case to a U.S. Magistrate Judge for assistance in
   managing it. To do so, an Order of Referral is executed. Once a case
   has been referred to a magistrate judge, subsequent court proceedings
   may be conducted before that judge. Filing of Motions and Objections:
   Either party, the plaintiff or the defendant, may request that the
   court take specific action related to the case. To do so, the party
   prepares a formal request or what is referred to as a motion. The party
   then signs the motion, submits it or files it with the Clerk of Court
   and sends a copy to the opposing party. Unless the assigned judge
   directs otherwise, every motion must be accompanied by a memorandum of
   law citing supporting legal authorities (see Local Rule 7). The
   opposing party may then file with the Clerk of Court an objection or
   responsive pleading to the motion. This objection sets forth the
   reasons why the court should deny rather than grant the motion. You
   should familiarize yourself with the rules and time limits set forth in
   Local Rule 7 with regard to motions and responsive pleadings filed in
   this court. (Dispositive vs. Non-dispositive Motions Defined): Motions
   fall into two broad categories: dispositive and non-dispositive.
   Dispositive motions, if granted, dispose of the case; non- dispositive
   motions, if granted, affect the case but do not dispose of it. District
   judges have the authority to rule on both kinds of motions. Magistrate
   judges are authorized to rule only on non- dispositive motions unless
   all parties in the law suit have consented to allow their case to
   proceed entirely with the magistrate judge; if the case has full
   consent of all parties, the magistrate judge has the authority to rule
   on both dispositive and non-dispositive motions. Motion Review: The
   district or magistrate judge normally rules on a motion by issuing a
   written order that either grants, denies, or partially grants and
   partially denies the relief sought in the motion. The court generally
   does not schedule hearings in order for the parties to argue the motion
   or objections. 10 Filing of Magistrate Judge Report and Recommendation:
   Where a case has been referred to a magistrate judge and one of the
   parties files a dispositive motion, the magistrate judge is authorized
   to prepare a written Report and Recommendation, essentially a
   recommendation that the motion be either granted or denied and stating
   the reason(s) why. This Report and Recommendation is forwarded to the
   district judge assigned to the case and copies are sent to the parties.
   As a party, you have a certain number of days to file objections you
   may have to the Report and Recommendation. All objections that are
   received within the specified time are forwarded to the district judge.
   The district judge reviews the Report and Recommendation and any
   objections that have been filed and subsequently issues an order that
   adopts, rejects, or adopts in part and rejects in part the magistrate
   judge's Report and Recommendation. Where the judge's order dismisses
   the complaint, the clerk of court will prepare and enter judgment in
   the case. Such judgment is final and can be appealed to the United
   States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit located in Atlanta,
   Georgia. Recusal of the Judge: Occasionally, parties involved in a
   proceeding are unhappy with the decision(s) of the judge who is
   handling their case so they file a motion requesting that the judge
   recuse himself to allow another judge to hear the case. A party who is
   considering filing a motion to recuse should note that a judge's
   ruling(s) on a particular case rarely provides a basis for requiring
   the judge to recuse himself from that case. D. WHAT COURT FEES AND
   COSTS ARE YOU REQUIRED TO PAY? The fee for filing a complaint and
   opening a civil case in any U.S. District Court is $150 as specified
   previously under the section entitled Filing Your Complaint. This may
   be paid by cash, money order, or personal check. If you are unable to
   pay the filing fee, you may apply for permission of the court to
   proceed in forma pauperis, which is Latin for "in the form of a
   pauper." Information on filing in forma pauperis is located in Section
   IV on Page 14 of this guide. If the court allows you to proceed in
   forma pauperis, you are not exempted from paying other costs associated
   with pursuing or litigating your case. If, for example, you need copies
   of original documents in your case file, the clerk's office is required
   to charge the standard rate of 50 cents per page. Other expenses you
   will incur include the costs of preparing the original and copies of
   the papers you file with the court, and mailing or hand-delivering a
   copy of each paper to the opposing party to satisfy the requirements of
   service. If your case goes to trial, you may be responsible for certain
   costs associated with bringing your witnesses to court. E. WHAT IS THE
   PROCEDURE FOR SUBMITTING DOCUMENTS TO THE COURT? As a matter of policy,
   the court only requires parties to submit for filing with the Clerk of
   Court an original of motions or pleadings. However, should you need a
   file-stamped copy of a pleading or motion for your records, submit an
   extra copy along with the original and a self- addressed stamped
   envelope for return mailing. The Clerk's Office will file stamp both
   the original 11 l ORMATION ABOUT THE STATUe eeeeeeOF YOUR CASE?f and
   the copy, place the original in the court's case file, and return the
   copy to you. You may file pleadings with the court in person or by mail
   (see Section II on Page 8 for office locations and mailing addresses).
   Our offices, with the exception of Thomasville, are open to the public
   from 8:30 A.M. until 5:00 P.M., Monday through Friday, except on
   federal holidays. For ease of filing, the Clerk maintains a twenty-four
