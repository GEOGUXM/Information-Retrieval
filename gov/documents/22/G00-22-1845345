      I would like to use some of the imagery from Earth from Space. What are
                       NASA's rules for using this imagery?

      All of the imagery on this site is public domain. There are, however, a
       few restrictions on its use you should be aware of. Details on NASA's
                           usage policy can be found at:
                      http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/policies.html.

                     How do I download images to my computer?

        To download images, just browse through the site until you find an
      image you are interested in, then click on the appropriate link to view
      the low resolution or high resolution version of the image. These links
      are available on every image information page on Earth from Space, such
                                   as this one:
           http://earth.jsc.nasa.gov/photoinfo.cgi?PHOTO=STS090-732-076

      Once the image has completely loaded into your Web browser window, take
              the following steps to save it to your computer.

                             Windows Computers:

   Right-mouse-click on the image in your Web browser, and an small window
    will open with a menu of options. Select "Save Picture As" (Internet
     Explorer) or "Save Image As" (Netscape) from the menu. A new window
    will open. In this window, select a location on your computer to save
     the image to and click the Save button. That's it! The image is now
                        downloaded to your computer.

           This technique will work on any image on any Web site.

     Why don't you have any pictures of my city or region on your site?

     The imagery on this site is selected based on aesthetic quality and
        scientific interest rather than geographical location. Photo
   opportunities are also constrained by the orbital path of the Shuttle,
              prevailing weather conditions, and other factors.

    New images are added periodically to Earth from Space, so check back
                                 frequently!

     Are high-resolution, uncompressed versions of these images, such as
                       TIFF files, available on-line?

          No. Due to the extremely large file size of uncompressed
     high-resolution images, we are unable to provide on-line access to
                                    them.
