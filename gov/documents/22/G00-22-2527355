   Strategic Directions for the Washington State Library (01-01-4101)
   The 2000 Legislature directed the Washington State Institute for Public
   Policy "to study the mission, programs, and usage of the state
   library."  This study focused on three key questions related to this
   direction:  1)  Are there options for redefining the roles and
   functions of the Washington State Library (WSL)?  2) What value can the
   WSL add to the delivery of information to the legislature and state
   government agencies?  3) Is the current location of the WSL on the
   capitol campus essential to its effective operation?  Results of
   interviews, focus group meetings, and a survey of state government
   users are incorporated into the final recommendations.  [Kay Knapp -
