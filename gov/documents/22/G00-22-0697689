It is the mission of the Warning Research & Development Division of the
National Severe Storms Laboratory...

   To perform research to gain understanding of severe and hazardous
   weather (wind, hail, tornado and rain); Research Images
   Applications Images to identify and diagnose severe weather signatures
   in observational data,


   and to develop and transfer new scientific understanding, applications,
   and techniques (including warning decision support systems) to the
   National Weather Service and other customers to enhance their
   capability to provide accurate warnings and nowcasts of hazardous
   weather.
