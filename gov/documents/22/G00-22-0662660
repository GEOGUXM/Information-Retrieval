   During the 1999-2000 academic year, more than a quarter million degrees
   (approximately 78,000 associates, 121,000 bachelors, 44,000 masters,
   5,500 doctorate, and 7,800 first professional) were awarded by
   California degree-granting institutions. Though there is significant
   increase at all degree levels during the past thirty years, the biggest
   increase was noticed for first professional degrees (147%), followed by
   masters (127%) and bachelors (79%) degrees.
