   Howard Hall
   Program Leader
   The MCAP mission is to focus on CMS core capabilities to solve key LLNL
   materials problems. As its primary responsibility, MCAP strategically
   manages and invests in CMS scientific capabilities to sustain and
   enhance their value to the Laboratorys mission and programs. MCAP
   committee members represent the three divisions within CMS, with Howard
   Hall as Program Leader. MCAP was implemented in FY98 as CMS Strategic
   New Initiative with Louis J. Terminello as Program Leader.

   Major FY00 Accomplishments
     * Managed $1.6M of Institutional General Purpose Equipment (IGPE)
       investment in CMS capabilities.
     * Transitioned human capability investments concepts to the Tech
       Development construct.
     * Managed and oversaw the retirement of the Analytical Science
       Research and Support recharge, assisting staff in redeploying to
       programs and ending the unsupported corporate analytical
       capability at LLNL.

   Continued implementation of CMS recharge service centers to one
   Directorate-wide service center buffered the extreme oscillations in
   demand and funding resulting from the LLNL-wide decision to redirect
   resources to NIF.

   FY00 IGPE Investments
     * Aerosol Time-of-FlightMass Spectrometer,
     * MALDI Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer,
     * FTIR/Ramon Microscope,
     * Low Background GAB Counters,
     * Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometer (FTMS), and
     * Agilent Technology HP6890 Gas Chromatograph and Agilent Technology
       HP1100 Liquid Chromatograph.

   FY01 Strategic Actions
     * Continue improving MCAP business practices,
     * Enhance customer satisfaction, and
     * Continue developing formalized MCAP investment strategies that map
       onto CMS strategic vision.
