   Press & Reading Rooms Press releases, speeches by board members,
       publications, and testimony before Congress inform the public about
       Finance Board's position on safety and soundness issues of the
       FHLBank System.
    Freedom of Information Act
       The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which can be found in Title
       5 of the United States Code, section 552, provides that any person
       has the right to request access to federal agency records or
       information. All agencies of the United States government are
       required to disclose records upon receiving a written request for
       them, except for those records that are protected from disclosure
       by the nine exemptions and three exclusions of the FOIA. This
       right-of-access is enforceable in court.
       The Finance Board maintains both public and nonpublic records.
       Public records are available at the Finance Board's conventional
       reading room, an electronic reading room, and on its web site. A
       FOIA request is not required to view these records.
       A FOIA request is required to obtain certain nonpublic records. If
       you cannot find the records or information on the Finance Board's
       web site, you may file a FOIA request for that data.
       A FOIA written request for information consists of a clear and
       specific description of the records or information being sought,
       along with the requester's name, address, telephone number, and
       electronic mail address, if any. The Finance Board may assess a
       fee, in accordance with our FOIA regulation, to process this
       request. FOIA requests should be sent by regular mail to: FOIA
       Officer, Federal Housing Finance Board, 1777 F Street NW.,
       Washington, DC 20006. Requests may be submitted by fax at
       202/408-2895, or electronically at foia@fhfb.gov.
       For further assistance, e-mail the Finance Board at foia@fhfb.gov
       or call 202/408-2511.
