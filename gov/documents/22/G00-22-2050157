   Harassment, and Sexual Orientation.

   For specific information on the discrimination complaint process,
   please refer to Administrative Procedure, EOMI 3, Discrimination
   Complaint; and, Administrative Procedure, EOMI  2, Sexual Harassment
   Complaint.

   Department employees or candidates who feel they have been
   discriminated against have the option of expressing their concerns in
   the informal or formal discrimination complaint procedure. These
   concerns are presented to trained and qualified
   counselors/investigators with the fullest assistance from the EOMI
   Office.

   INFORMAL

   The Department places great emphasis on EEO Counselors to resolve
   discrimination complaints at the informal level. The Counselorsâ€™ role
   is to provide a channel of communication through which applicants and
   employees may ask questions, express and discuss concerns, and obtain
   resolutions to potentially discriminatory problems. If you are faced
   with a situation that you feel is discriminatory, please contact the
   Counselor of your respective division/district/office, or call the EOMI
   Office. EEO Counselors are located in every division/district/office.
   For further details about the informal discrimination complaint
   process, please refer to Administrative Procedure EOMI 3.

   FORMAL

   When allegations of discrimination are raised at the formal level, an
   EOMI Office Investigator is assigned. The investigator may be part of
   the EOMI Office staff or a Department employee who is trained and
   qualified to conduct formal investigations. The investigator will
   conduct an investigation and submit an objective written Report of
   Findings to the EOMI Office Chief. The EOMI Office Chief then presents
   the findings to the EEO Review Committee, a group that advises the
   Director. The group is composed of: the Deputy Director, Chief of Legal
   Office, Chief of Administrative Services, and Chief of EOMI Office.
   Lastly, the Director issues a Letter of Determination to the
   complainant that identifies the merit or lack of merit .
