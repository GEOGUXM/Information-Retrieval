                                Climate History

   USGS conducts research to develop high quality records of past climates
   and environments and provide synoptic reconstructions of past climate
   conditions from evidence preserved in the geologic record. Our emphasis
   is on the late Cenozoic with greatest effort expended on the Pliocene
   and Quaternary. Our research is designed to determine the natural range
   of climate variability on time scales ranging from interannual to
   thousands of years; to identify and characterize conditions during
   intervals of rapid change; to determine the response of natural
   systems, climate- sensitive regions, and ecotones to past change,
   especially abrupt change; and to develop regional to global scale
   paleoenvironmental reconstructions for key intervals and events of the
   past.
