   Mid-Atlantic Major Land Resource Area (MO14)

   The Mid-Atlantic MO14 office produces high-quality soil surveys within
   areas not
   having a soil survey and explores new ways to provide soils information
   to our clients.

   National Resources Inventory (NRI) The National Resources Inventory
   (NRI) is a statistically based survey that has been designed and
   implemented using scientific principles to assess conditions and trends
   of soil, water, and related resources on non-Federal lands in the
   United States.

   The NRI is conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural
   Resources Conservation Service in cooperation with the Iowa State
   University Statistical Laboratory. It is a compilation of natural
   resource information on non-Federal land--nearly 75 percent of the
   Nations total land area.

   The 1997 NRI captures data on land cover and use, soil erosion, prime
   farmland soils, wetlands, habitat diversity, selected conservation
   practices, and related resource attributes at more than 800,000
   scientifically selected sample sites. Data used for the NRI were
   collected using a variety of imagery, field office records, historical
   records and data, ancillary materials, and a limited number of on-site
   visits. The data have been compiled, verified, and analyzed to provide
   a comprehensive look at the state of the Nations non-Federal lands.

   Wetlands. Wetlands are an important bridge between land and water. They
   filter pollutants from water, reduce flood damage, and recharge
   aquifers. Because they are so biologically rich, wetlands and adjacent
   upland represent an important habitat type for many wildlife species.
   They benefit many people economically as a result of fishing, hunting,
   and recreational opportunities.

   The rate of wetland loss on agricultural land has fallen dramatically
   since the 1950's, when agriculture, with government encouragement, was
   responsible for much of the nation's wetland conversions. Contributing
   today to the decline in agricultural wetland losses are conservation
   efforts by America's farmers and ranchers along with incentives
   provided by the Wetlands Reserve Program and the Emergency Wetlands
   Reserve Program.

   Despite progress, agricultural wetlands remain the most vulnerable to
   conversion, but also offer the greatest potential for restoration or
   enhancement. Opportunities exist to integrate wetland conservation
   goals with conservation goals for cropland, watersheds, grazing land,
   and wildlife habitat, among others.

     Did you know?

   Water quality benefits from agriculture's efforts to curb soil erosion,
   manage animal waste and agrichemical use, and adopt other practices
   that foster a sustainable agriculture.

   Wetland conservation is being integrated with the other conservation
   goals of farmers and ranchers.

   Soil erosion control has been a major accomplishment of our nation's
   farmers.

   Soil quality is the foundation of agricultural productivity and land
   health.

   Grazing lands -- key to the health of many watersheds -- present
   landowners with major conservation challenges.

   Land use in the United States is incredibly diverse and dynamic and
   constantly changing the landscape.

   People on the land -- farmers, ranchers, and other private landowners
   -- are building strong conservation partnerships to ensure the health
   of our land,
   the vast majority of which is in private hands.
