   Background

   Residential Thermal Distribution Systems generally refer to the method
   of distributing heating and cooling throughout a house. This includes
   the most popular systems that blow air through ducts and other systems
   that use water (e.g., radiant floors and hot water radiators) and
   electricity (e.g., baseboard heaters). Studies by LBNL and other
   researchers have shown that forced air systems have the potential for
   significant energy losses because of air leaks and their installation
   outside the heated and cooled parts of the house. Recent research
   funded by DOE and CIEE through LBNL has therefore concentrated on
   forced air distribution systems and found that typically a quarter of
   the energy (and therefore money) used for heating and cooling is wasted
   through duct system energy losses.

   The problems with forced air systems:
     * They are installed outside. In many places in the country the ducts
       (and the furnace and air conditioning coils) are located in attics,
       crawlspaces, garages, basements and other locations outside the
       heated or cooled parts of the house. Ducts in these locations not
       only leak air to and from outside, but any heat lost through the
       walls of the duct (by heat conduction) is also lost to outside
       instead of heating and cooling the house. This combination of air
       leaks and heat conduction losses means that a great deal of the
       energy (and money!) used to heat or cool the house actually ends up
       outside. It should be noted that in some places basements are lived
       in and are considered part of the conditioned space of the house.
       It is also common for these houses with conditioned basements to
       have all the ducts, the furnace and the air conditioner in the
       basement where any air leaks or heat conduction losses go to the
       basement and are therefore NOT lost to outside. In these cases the
       energy (and monetary) penalty for leaks and conduction losses is
       negligible. However, systems with lots of leaks will not supply
       sufficient heating or cooling to rooms in the house located far
       from the furnace or air conditioner, making these rooms
       uncomfortable for the occupants. In other words - losses from ducts
       count, even if they are not lost directly to outside.
     * They leak. Air leaks in and out of ducts at all the connections
       within a system (e.g. at plenums and behind registers). This
       leakage means that air that occupants have paid to have heated or
       cooled escapes from the heating or cooling system and does not heat
       or cool the house. Also, air leaks into the heating or cooling
       system increase the amount of outside air that must be heated or
       cooled. Outside air is usually cooler (for heating) or warmer and
       more humid (for cooling) than air inside the house and the heating
       or cooling capacity of the system is then used to heat or cool this
       outside air instead of the air in the house. Even with the heating
       and cooling system off, the leaks in the ducts increase the
       ventilation rate of the house - increasing the need for heating or
       cooling. The "leakage" from water and electric based systems is
       much rarer due to the somewhat catastrophic nature of leakage from
       these systems. In fact, building codes are extremely sensitive to
       leakage from water and electric based systems and there are strict
       controls regarding construction and installation of these systems
       due to the safety problems associated with their possible failure.

   Duct Installations

   In almost all new houses (and many existing houses) in California and
   elsewhere in the U.S., the most popular place to put the duct system is
   in the attic. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst places to put the
   ducts, particularly when cooling a house in the summer. Attics become
   extremely hot on summer afternoons (temperatures over 150Â° F are
   common) due to the sun shining on the roof. This heats up the ducts and
   the air inside them (particularly air leaks into ducts on the return
   side of the system). This results in air coming through the registers
   at higher temperatures and decreases the ability of the air
   conditioning system to cool the house. In particularly poor systems,
   the air supplied to the house through the registers can be HOTTER than
   the air in the house and the air conditioner actually heats the house!

   Duct systems tend to be ignored during building design and it is the
   installing contractor who has to decide where to put all the ducts.
   This results in systems that are difficult to maintain, service and
   retrofit or repair (to reduce losses). If you go and look in your
   attic, you will probably be met with a sight something like this where
   ducts fill much of the attic space in no organized fashion. Can you see
   the furnace in this picture? How would you change the furnace filter or
   repair this system?

   Where Ducts Leak

   Measurements of air leakage from ducts have shown that in most houses
   this leakage is more important than conduction losses and so much work
   at LBNL has focussed on duct leaks. Ducts are usually made from sheet
   metal (more common in older houses) or flexible plastic duct (used in
   almost all new houses - as shown in image (a)). Little or no air leaks
   out through the plastic or metals walls of these ducts. The air leaks
   out at the connections: from the furnace/air conditioner to the duct,
   at branches in the duct system (image b), and at connections from the
   duct to the registers (image c). Lastly, one of the greatest leakage
   problems occurs when there simply isn't any duct, and the walls or
   floors of the house are used as the "duct system" (image d).

   Leakage Testing

   A key aspect of recent work has been to look at different methods for
   measuring air leakage from ducts. A common method is to seal over the
   air supply registers and blow air into the system. This method is used
   for duct efficiency credits by utilities in energy efficient home
   rebate plans and by the California Energy Code, Title 24 (prepared by
   the California Energy Commission ). Because the intentional air outlets
   (the registers) are sealed any air blown into the system must be
   leaving through the leaks. By measuring the pressures in the ducts and
   the quantity of air blown into the ducts we can characterize the
   effective size of all unintentional air leaks in the duct system. Other
   tests include pressurizing the house at the same time as the ducts or
   using the fan in the furnace or air conditioner and measuring pressure
   changes in the house with the system operating. Alternative methods are
   currently being pursued through workshops with duct leakage testing
   experts and the results of these workshops will be used to provide
   utilities, home energy raters and code enforcement officials with
   improved and standardized test methods. The American Society for
   Testing and Materials) has a standard test method for duct leakage
   testing that we will be rewritten based on the results of field testing
   and these workshops.

   Duct Sealing

   Of course, when ducts are originally installed, an attempt is made to
   seal up the connections. After gathering anecdotal evidence from many
   sources regarding the failure of duct sealant methods, we have begun to
   document sealant failures and also perform laboratory tests on sealants
   to determine which sealants perform better than others. The most common
   sealant is duct tape and we have found that it often peels off duct
   systems leaving a characteristic residue (a & b) that is the remains of
   the adhesive. On new installations, tape may fall off due to poor
   surface preparation because ducts are installed in dirty and dusty
   locations and conditions. On other than brand new systems, the tape
   falls off as it ages and the adhesive dries out and the tape tends to
   wrinkle (c & d).

   Duct Sealant Testing

   To confirm the anecdotal evidence regarding duct tape failures we
   developed a laboratory test procedure that alternately blows hot and
   cold air through sample duct connections. This test does not simulate
   what happens to ducts in a specific installation, but it does provide a
   basis for comparison between different duct sealants. We tested 19
   different sealants including: cloth, metal foil and plastic backed
   tapes, mastic and an aerosol sealant developed at LBNL. The major
   result was that the only sealant to fail was the cloth backed tapes.
   This result generated considerable media interest led to numerous
   newspaper articles, press releases, radio interviews and even a mention
   on NPR's "cartalk". For more information see our duct tape page. We are
   currently drafting an ASTM Standard test procedure based on our
   experiments, that can be used by others to rate the relative longevity
   of duct sealants. The following figure shows eight samples in our test
   apparatus.

   Duct Insulation

   Usually ducts are only insulated if they are outside the conditioned
   space. Older duct systems made of sheet metal are often found in
   basements and have no insulation. Some of these older sheet metal ducts
   have an asbestos based thin layer of insulation added to them. This
   thin layer of asbestos gives the ducts a small increase in thermal
   resistance. Occasionally, these poorly insulated sheet metal ducts can
   also be found in unconditioned spaces, such as attics or crawlspaces.

   Ducts in new houses are often made of insulated flexible plastic duct.
   This duct is usually labeled on the outside liner with its R-Value. The
   heat stopping ability of insulation is indicated by the R-value, with
   higher R-values denoting better performance. Most flexible plastic
   ducts have R4 insulation (compared to about R1 for uninsulated sheet
   metal ducts). In some cases a mixture of insulation will be seen. For
   example, glass fiber insulation without a paper, plastic or foil
   backing is often used around duct connections and plenums. In recent
   years, innovative methods for insulating ducts have been developed. For
   example, ducts can be laid on the attic floor; they are then surrounded
   by cardboard channels and cellulose insulation in blown in around and
   over the ducts.

   When houses or heating/cooling systems are renovated, insulation is
   added to existing ducts, because it can be cheaper than replacing the
   ducts. The following illustration shows ducts being wrapped in foil
   backed insulation (often called "duct wrap"). The potential for energy
   and cost savings can be significant, particularly when adding
   insulation to poorly insulated ducts. Even when ducts are inside the
   living (conditioned) space these conduction losses can be important
   because the losses from long duct runs can lead to rooms being
   uncomfortable because they not receive enough heating or cooling.

   The term "duct efficiency" indicates how much energy entering a duct
   system is provided to the house, thus, higher efficiency ducts are
   better. To evaluate the effects of duct losses, LBNL has been involved
   in the development of ASHRAE Standard 152P"Method of Test for
   Determining the Design and Seasonal Efficiencies of Residential Thermal
   Distribution Systems" (ASHRAE 1999). Using the calculation procedures
   in the standard allows us to estimate the effects of duct insulation on
   duct system efficiency. Note that only the seasonal efficiencies from
   152P are discussed here because they are the most appropriate for
   estimating energy consumption in buildings. The effects at peak
   conditions will be greater than those shown here due to the more
   extreme weather conditions, and therefore more extreme duct location
   temperatures. Examples are given here for typical systems in six cities
   chosen to represent a wide range of weather conditions. The maximum
   benefit gained by insulating ducts is when the ducts are in locations
   that have acute temperatures. These effects are highly variable - being
   greater for more extreme climates and duct locations, so it is
   necessary to take these variables into account when assessing the
   cost-effectiveness and other benefits of duct insulation.

   As insulation is added in steps from R2 to R8 there are diminishing
   returns with each step as shown in the accompanying figure. If we also
   include practical space considerations (R8 adds about six inches (150
   mm) to the duct diameter) a couple of optimum options appear. For new
   installations that can be more flexible about duct size, R6 ducts are
   good for most cases. Similarly, if decisions are being made about
   adding insulation to ducts, and the ducts already have R4.2 or greater
   insulation, then it is unlikely to be a practical and cost-effective
   measure to add insulation. Below this level however, ducts do receive
   considerable benefit from the added insulation. Lastly, in some cases
   the added insulation has very little benefit particularly when the
   ducts are in locations where temperature differences between air in the
   ducts and their surroundings is negligible.

   Changing the Marketplace

   With regard to energy losses, we have worked on the development of
   proposed ASHRAE Standard 152P (that is currently being redrafted after
   its public review). This standard will be used by building designers,
   by the home energy rating industry and in building and energy codes to
   account for duct system energy losses more precisely than current
   practice. For example, a simplified version of the proposed standard
   has already been incorporated into the Alternative Calculations Manual
   in the California State Energy Code (Title 24) for low-rise residential
   buildings. In addition to incorporating this calculation procedure we
   have provided technical advice for Title 24, including recommended
   leakage levels for ducts, information required to perform the necessary
   testing and energy loss calculations and advice for sampling houses to
   be tested. A very important aspect of the changes to Title 24 is that
   field testing will be required to obtain an energy credit for having
   good ducts. This is a considerable change from previous practice in
   building/energy codes where a simple specification for performance of a
   building component was given and no testing required to determine if
   the specification was met.

   Comfort and Sizing

   Air conditioning cooling capacity is often measured in "tons". A ton of
   cooling represents the heat energy required to melt one ton of ice in
   24 hours. Because duct systems lose energy that is supposed to heat or
   cool the house, they change the effective capacity of the heating and
   cooling equipment. For example, a three ton air conditioner connected
   to a duct system of 70% efficiency effectively becomes a two ton air
   conditioner. Given that the homeowner has paid for the three ton unit
   and pays its operating costs (it still consumes all the electricity
   required for three tons of cooling) they need to know just how much of
   what they have paid for they are getting. A way of doing this is to
   evaluate the whole heating and cooling system by looking at the actual
   heating or cooling delivered at the air supply registers to the
   occupied space. For cooling we have coined the phrase "Tons at the
   register" (TAR) to describe this number. This capacity at the register
   is what is needed to keep the occupants comfortable.

   We have also developed a sophisticated computer simulation tool that
   calculates building loads, duct losses and equipment performance (based
   on weather, refrigerant charge and extra loads due to poor ducts). We
   have used this tool to estimate how fast a house can be cooled down
   after it has been allowed to heat up all day. This is called the
   PULLDOWN time and is a critical factor in keeping occupants
   comfortable. The quicker a system pulls down the indoor temperature to
   that set by the occupants the better the system because the occupants
   have to spend less time in an overheated house. We used field tests in
   real houses to determine input data for the simulations.

   Simulation results showed that improved ducts (low leakage) and
   improved system installation (moving ducts into conditioned space form
   the attic) can allow the use of a smaller nameplate capacity air
   conditioner without reducing the TAR or the pulldown time. (A three ton
   unit can be used rather than a four ton for a typical house in
   Sacramento, CA.) If system nameplate capacity is unchanged, either
   improving duct systems (to minimize air leakage) and correctly
   installing the equipment, or moving the ducts to inside the conditioned
   space results in the pulldown being reduced by more than an hour, so
   the occupants become comfortable sooner.
