NIS-7 Overview

   Safeguards Systems Capabilities include:

   Systems studies for nonproliferation analyze complex interactions
   between nuclear facility operations and verification technologies and
   procedures. The studies define technical and policy options for the
   implementation of nonproliferation regimes. Areas of development and
   capabilities demonstrated by systems studies include design and
   evaluation of domestic safeguards systems, design and evaluation of
   international verification systems, safeguards systems design
   optimization, policy development and analysis for DOE, facility
   simulation, signature/indicator analysis and evaluation of nuclear
   facilities, familiarity with all aspects of nuclear facility
   operations, security of safeguards information systems, and computer
   security.

   Information analysis covers a broad area of algorithm development: data
   analysis, anomaly detection (identifying anomalies in safeguards
   information, satellite data, review of video and sensor data, and fraud
   detection), risk analysis, and automatic database assessment (utilizing
   expert systems, neural networks, and statistical decision procedures).

   The growing area of information management includes the development of
   nuclear material accounting software to help manage DOE's nuclear
   material (incorporating the technologies of relational database design
   and graphical user interfaces), the use of open source information, and
   the storage and retrieval of large quantities of safeguards-relevant
   text.

   NIS-7 provides services to many organizations and countries throughout
   the world, including:


   [bluedot.gif] DOE (nuclear materials control and accounting software,
   image processing software, and technical support to policy development
   in nonproliferation)
   [bluedot.gif] International Atomic Energy Agency (reprocessing
   safeguards methods)
   [bluedot.gif] National Security Agency (data analysis software)
   [bluedot.gif] Japan (systems studies, simulations, and anomaly
   detection for mixed oxide fuel fabrication and reprocessing facilities)
   [bluedot.gif] Russia, Kazakhstan, and the Ukraine (materials control
   and accounting support and training)
   [bluedot.gif] South Korea (technical interactions in safeguards)

   In addition, NIS-7 is a member of the Nuclear Safeguards organization,
   which also includes
   Safeguards Science and Technology (NIS-5) and Advanced Nuclear
   Technology (NIS-6).
