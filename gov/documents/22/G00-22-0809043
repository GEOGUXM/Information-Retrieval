Tips for Ferry Travel

     * Avoid the summer weekend/holiday rush. Arrive at the terminal at
       least one to two hours before scheduled sailing time.
     * Whenever possible, use local transport and leave you car behind;
       foot passengers and cyclists dont have to wait for the next ferry!
     * Bring a jacket. Outside decks offer a refreshing ride, but they can
       get breezy.
     * Eat on board. Enjoy specialty beverages, light meals and snacks in
       the ferry caf√©, or bring your own picnic.
     * Pets are allowed on the car deck only.
