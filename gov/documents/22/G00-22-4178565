   * What is the Resource?

   The Resource provides access to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
   primary breast cancer tissue with associated clinical and follow-up
   data for research studies, particularly those studies focused on
   translating basic research findings into clinical application. The
   Resource database contains pathologic and clinical information linked
   to a large collection of breast tissue specimens that is available for
   research. Researchers can determine whether the Resource has the
   tissues and patient data they need for their individual research
   studies by searching the database.

   The organizations contributing to the Resource have access to tissue
   and data from local patients in four geographically diverse areas of
   the United States. Participants include:


            *     Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA
            * Kaiser Foundation Research Institute, Portland, OR
            *           University of Miami, Miami, FL
            *       Washington University, St. Louis, MO.

   The central database is maintained at Information Management Services
   in Rockville, MD.

   * How does the Resource work?

   Tissue sections will be prepared to meet the requirements of approved
   research protocols. The Resource will also provide clinical and outcome
   data, including demographic data, diagnosis, extent of disease,
   treatment, follow-up, recurrence, survival, and vital status. The
   Resource cannot provide information that would identify any patient or
   family member. There is a charge for the preparation of sections and
   for shipping. Studies on Resource material may be funded by Federal or
   non-Federal sources. The Resource does not provide funding for
   research.

   * Who can obtain specimens?

   Specimens and data are available for research judged meritorious by the
   Research Evaluation Panel (REP), an independent scientific review
   group. The Resource collection is particularly well-suited for
   evaluation of diagnostic and prognostic markers since it includes
   primary breast cancer tissue with associated clinical and outcome data.
   The Resource will document the availability of the specimens required
   for approved studies to support applications for research funding. The
   Resource is available both to academic and commercial researchers.
