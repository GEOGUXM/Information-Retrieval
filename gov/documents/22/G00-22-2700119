   The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
   hosted a public workshop to examine technological tools and
   developments that can enhance consumer privacy online. The workshop was
   webcast in RealAudio on the day of the event. In partnership with the
   Internet Education Foundation, NTIA also hosted a Technology Fair to
   demonstrate the use and capabilities of a broad spectrum of online
   privacy technologies. An agenda for this workshop is available, as is a
   list of demonstrators at the Technology Fair, and a transcript of the
   workshop proceedings.
