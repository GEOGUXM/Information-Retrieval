   Environmental Management (EM) projects are capturing an increasing
   large amount of public funds. In order to improve cost estimating and
   cost management of environmental management projects in DOE, the
   Applied Cost Engineering (ACE) team of the Environmental Management
   program, in coordination with the Environmental Cost Engineering
   Committee (ECEC) developed an Environmental Cost Element Structure
   (ECES). This structure provides a common set of elements that can be
   used to describe the technical and administrative components with
   related costs for completed EM projects. Cost collection for these
   projects and cost estimates for planned and active projects are
   expedited by using ECES.

   The ACE team has also developed the Environmental Cost Analysis System
   (ECAS) to create and maintain a database of completed Department of
   Energy Environmental Management projects. The ECAS was developed to
   store and retrieve data using the ECES structure and cost driving
   parameters (secondary parameters) down to level 3 elements and lower
   (level 5) if necessary. ECAS will allow the users to enter project
   information interactively or in batch mode (using standard file
   formats) . The system will provide reporting and querying capabilities
   of ECAS data to enable users to develop estimates for new projects,
   establishing bench marks, cost control and cost management purposes.

   Anyone using Internet Explorer (Netscape and other web browsers will
   NOT work) can access the Environmental Cost Analysis Systems Test
   Module by setting their User Name as ECAS and their Password as
   ECASUSER or by clicking on the following button:

   Access to the actual cost data in the system is restricted as follows:

    1. All DOE personnel will have "read-only" access to ECAS and all
       details.
    2. DOE Contractors have access to ECAS and all detail data for their
       own sites.
    3. DOE Contractors from another site wanting access to ECAS detailed
       information will need to contact and get approval from the Site of
       where the data is coming.
    4. DOE contractors otherwise will only have "read-only" access to
       summary level canned report (at this time).
    5. Only designated DOE contractors will have "read-write" access for
       their own site data.
     6. Fed POC information will be included in the summary report sheet,
         for getting clarification regarding project cost data or other
                              related information.
    7. Data will be QA by NETL before the information is included in the
       production database (i.e., what everyone can see).

        Anyone wanting access to the ECAS database cost data or ECAS
   "read-only" access should contact Terry Brennan or Jake Appetta, NETL.
         Terry Brennan and Jake Appetta can be contacted on phone at
                412-386-5989 and 412-386-4762 or by e-mail at
   terry.brennan@netl.doe.gov and jake.appetta@netl.doe.gov respectively.

    As ECAS is a new system, users may find some glitches in entering the
     data or getting access to the any part of the system, please inform
              about those glitches to Jake Appetta by e-mail at
                         jake.appetta@netl.doe.gov.


    You must use Internet Explorer to access ECAS. Netscape and other web
    browsers cannot be used as they will not properly support some of the
    functions in the system.
