       Welcome to the offices of Senator Pat Roberts via the World Wide
   Web.  It is my hope that this information will help to keep you
   informed of my Floor activities, Committee involvement and other
   materials of interest to the constituents of our great State of Kansas.

   Flag Orders: Our office is now accepting flag requests.  Please note
   that it could be months before your request is received, processed and
   sent to you. The Senate flag office is receiving limited shipments of
   flags.   I'm sorry  for the inconvenience and I appreciate your
   patience and understanding during this time.
