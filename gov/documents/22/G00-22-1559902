   The mission of the Team Battelle Volunteer Program is:

     "To positively impact the quality of life in communities where
     Battelle staff live and work by supporting and initiating
     volunteer-driven programs and activities that meet the community's
     needs, capitalize on staff's interests, and are consistent with
     Battelle's corporate citizenship priorities."
