      Researchers Identify Potential Treatment for Learning Disability in

Overview

   Researchers studying learning disabilities associated with
   neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF1, have traced the problem to excessive
   activity of a crucial signaling molecule and have successfully reversed
   the disabilities in mice by giving them an experimental drug. The
   findings provide hope that these learning problems may one day be
   treatable in humans.

   Researchers studying learning disabilities associated with
   neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF1, have traced the problem to excessive
   activity of a crucial signaling molecule and have successfully reversed
   the disabilities in mice by giving them an experimental drug. The
   findings provide hope that these learning problems may one day be
   treatable in humans.

   This study provides the first clear picture of what causes learning
   impairments in NF1, says study author Alcino J. Silva, Ph.D., of the
   University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

   NF1 is a genetic disorder that affects about one in every 4000 people.
   Patients with the disorder have an array of symptoms, including benign
   tumors called neurofibromas and light brown spots on the skin called
   caf√©-au-lait spots. About half of the affected individuals have
   cognitive disabilities, which typically include problems with spatial
   learning (which affects organization and other abilities) and reading.
   The study appears in the January 16, 2002, electronic edition of
   Nature^1 and was supported in part by the National Institute of
   Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

   In the new study, Dr. Silva, Rui M. Costa, and colleagues studied mice
   with a mutation in the gene for NF1. This gene produces a protein
   called neurofibromin that controls activity of a signaling protein
   called Ras. To investigate whether Ras plays a role in NF1-associated
   learning impairments, the researchers crossed the NF1 mice with mice
   that had another mutation (K-ras) that decreases Ras activity.

   They found that mice with mutations in either NF1 or K-ras had impaired
   performance on a test of spatial learning called the water maze test.
   Mice with both mutations, however, did as well as normal mice on this
   test. This suggests that the learning impairment in the NF1 mice was
   due to an excessive amount of Ras signaling and that this impairment
   can be surmounted by reducing the amount of Ras.

   The scientists also found that they could improve learning in the NF1
   mice using an experimental drug that prevents Ras from carrying out its
   signaling role in cells.

   The researchers also found evidence that explains how the abnormal NF1
   gene leads to learning disabilities. Neurofibromin normally controls
   Ras activity and keeps it in check. Without this control, too much Ras
   signaling occurs. Experiments showed that the abnormal Ras activity
   increases nerve signals that inhibit activity-related changes
   (plasticity) in the synapses between neurons. Researchers believe these
   synaptic changes, called long-term potentiation or LTP, are the basis
   for learning in the brain.

   The finding that drug therapy could reverse the learning impairment in
   adult mice is important because many scientists and physicians have
   thought that NF1-related learning problems are due to abnormal brain
   development, says Dr. Silva. The new study suggests that this may not
   be the case and provides hope for treating the thousands of NF1
   patients worldwide who experience learning problems.

   The drug that reversed the NF1-associated learning impairments in mice
   is already in clinical trials to determine if it can help reduce the
   number of tumors in NF1, Dr. Silva says.

   The researchers were surprised to find that the K-ras mutants, which
   have too little Ras signaling, had learning impairments just like the
   NF1 mutants, which have too much Ras, says Dr. Silva. This finding
   suggests that a specific amount of Ras activity - not too much and not
   too little - is important for learning. "It's like when you have too
   much acceleration or not enough braking - both are bad," Dr. Silva
   says.

   This study is one of the first instances in which researchers have been
   able to reduce the symptoms of a neurological disorder in an animal
   model using their understanding of the molecular interactions that
   cause the disorder, says Dr. Silva. "This is the long-standing promise
   of the human genome project - the cloned genes can lead us to animal
   models, and the animal models to information that can be used in
   designing treatments."

   While these findings are encouraging, the researchers caution that they
   are not the entire story. Scientists need to confirm these findings and
   determine what cell types play a role in these learning impairments.

   However, "we now have something concrete that makes sense, with many
   lines of evidence converging. The hope is to exploit these findings to
   develop strategies to reduce these problems in humans," says Dr. Silva.
   He is now planning human studies of NF1-related learning problems in
   collaboration with a clinical lab at UCLA. Those studies should help
   develop measurements and tools that can be used in testing potential
   treatments.
