   To understand the LANL waste management strategy, one must first have
   an understanding of the types and amounts of waste requiring management
   at LANL, the facilities used to manage these wastes, and the
   organization responsible for the safe and compliant operation of these
   facilities and the ultimate disposition of all existing and future
   wastes at LANL.
   There are seven major waste management facilities or operations used to
   treat, store, retrieve, dispose, or prepare waste for shipment to
   off-site facilities. Each of these seven facilities or operations is
   described in the following paragraphs. All of LANL's Chemical Waste is
   stored and prepared for shipment off-site within Technical Area (TA)-54
   at Area L. This waste is generated at over 700-800 individual locations
   across the entire Laboratory. Annually, LANL generates, manages, and
   ships off-site for treatment and disposal approximately 1,000 cubic
   meters of Chemical Waste that is either hazardous, toxic, chemical,
   medical, infectious, biological, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyl
   (PCB) or other wastes. Asbestos and hazardous wastes make up the major
   portion of these wastes.

   An additional approximately 250 cubic meters of administratively
   controlled and classified waste is disposed of on-site at TA-54 Area J.
   Chemical Waste is characterized and packaged by generators to comply
   with the appropriate waste acceptance criteria (WAC). Once approved for
   pickup from the generator location, waste is collected and transported
   to TA-54 Area J, for asbestos waste, and Area L for all other wastes.
   Asbestos waste is staged at Area J prior to disposal off-site at a
   permitted landfill. All other Chemical Waste is received at Area L
   where it is inspected and then staged prior to off-site disposal.
   Non-radioactive medical waste and PCB contaminated waste is packaged
   and transported to an off-site incinerator for thermal destruction. The
   remaining Chemical Wastes are repackaged as necessary and then shipped
   for treatment or disposal at permitted off-site facilities.
   Liquid LLW is generated at multiple research and production facilities
   across LANL. This waste is collected and treated to reduce radioactive
   contamination to levels that meet the limits specified in applicable
   NPDES permits and DOE Orders. The majority of the Liquid LLW generated
   by LANL facilities is treated at the Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment
   Facility (RLWTF) located at TA-50. This facility processes on average
   4.8 million gallons of liquid influent per year. The facility performs
   chemical and physical separation processes to concentrate radioactive
   constituents in a sludge that is dewatered to 30 percent solids. The
   sludge is solidified and, depending on radionuclide concentration,
   either disposed of as LLW or stored as TRU waste. Activities are
   presently underway to either refurbish or replace the TA-50 facility
   using Best Demonstrated Available Technology.
   LANL generates about 4,000 cubic meters of solid low-level waste (LLW)
   per year from normal operations and disposes of this waste in an
   on-site disposal facility located at TA-54, Area G. No solid LLW is
   presently stored at LANL. With the increase in waste from new programs
   at LANL and from environmental remediation projects it is presently
   projected that the amount of solid LLW may increase to approximately
   5,000 cubic meters per year, requiring disposal during the next several
   years.
   Remaining identified disposal capacity in the presently authorized
   disposal area within Area G is limited and will be exhausted in 3
   years. Studies are underway to develop additional capacity within the
   present area approved for LLW disposal. Additionally, an expansion of
   the area authorized for LLW disposal is being evaluated in the LANL
   Site Wide Environmental Impact Statement being prepared by DOE.
   Waste meeting the Area G WAC is collected from generators, transported
   to Area G, and then disposed of in pits or shafts. The majority of
   waste is placed in disposal pits which vary in size but typically have
   a capacity of several thousand cubic meters. Vertical shafts ranging in
   diameter from one to several meters and a depth of about 20 meters are
   used for the disposal of waste requiring remote handling or containing
   high concentrations of specific radionuclides.
   A compactor has been installed at Area G which is used on some types of
   solid LLW.

   LANL generates approximately 50-75 cubic meters of Mixed LLW annually.
   A total of approximately 500 cubic meters is in permitted storage at
   TA-54 Areas L and G. The Mixed LLW presently being generated and
   already in storage has a variety of physical and chemical forms,
   including de-watered sludges; radioactively contaminated lead and
   miscellaneous organic, inorganic, corrosive, toxic, and reactive
   materials: uranium chips and turnings; and radioactively contaminated
   PCBs. The majority of Mixed LLW in storage requires further
   characterization in order to permit treatment and disposal.
   The LANL Mixed Waste Site Treatment Plan was approved by the State of
   New Mexico October 4, 1995. This plan governs the treatment and
   disposal of LANL's Mixed LLW. In accordance with the Site Waste
   Treatment Plan, commercially available treatment and disposal
   facilities for LANL's Mixed LLW are being identified and used, as are
   mixed LLW capabilities at other DOE sites located outside of New
   Mexico.
   LANL is shipping Mixed LLW to the appropriate commercial and DOE
   facilities once it is sufficiently characterized and shipment approval
   is obtained from DOE. To date shipments of Mixed Waste containing
   scintillation fluids or other organics and some contaminated lead have
   been shipped for off-site treatment or disposal at commercial
   facilities.

   LANL currently generates approximately 100-200 cubic meters of TRU
   waste annually. Presently, more than 8,500 cubic meters of TRU waste is
   in storage at TA-54 Area G, which will be characterized in accordance
   with requirements to allow eventual shipment to the Waste Isolation
   Pilot Plant (WIPP). TRU and Mixed TRU waste generated after 1986 is
   stored on pads in domes meeting the requirements of the RCRA.
   Prior to 1986, TRU and Mixed TRU was stored under plywood, plastic, and
   earthen covers. The TRU and Mixed TRU waste placed in these storage
   units (Pads 1,2, and 4 in Area G) is the subject of a Consent Agreement
   between LANL and the State of New Mexico. Under this agreement, the
   Transuranic Waste Inspectable Storage Project (TWISP) will retrieve the
   waste on Pads 1, 2, and 4; examine, characterize, and repackage it as
   necessary; and place it in inspectable storage.
   The Waste Characterization, Reduction, and Repackaging Facility
   (WCRRF), the Radioactive Materials Research, Operations and
   Demonstration (RAMROD) facility, and the Radioassay and Non-Destructive
   Testing (RANT) facility are the three principal facilities at LANL for
   the characterization and eventual certification of TRU and Mixed TRU.
   The WCRRF, RAMROD, and RANT provide the capabilities and equipment and
   will be the primary locations where retrieved waste is characterized to
   meet the requirements of the LANL Consent Agreement and the WIPP WAC.
   WCRRF and RAMROD are the facilities where the coring of waste drums,
   visual characterization of waste materials, sorting, and size
   reduction, if necessary, will take place. RANT is the location where
   the waste packages will undergo radioassay, radiography, and ultrasonic
   testing; be vented and have head gas samples collected; and eventually
   be certified and loaded into TRUPACT-II packages for transport to WIPP.
