   U.S. Volcano Observatories and the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program

                            Horizontal blue line

   To study active volcanism and warn of impending eruptions in the United
   States, we depend on the scientific study and monitoring of volcanoes
   at five volcano observatories and the USGS Western Region Center in
   Menlo Park, California. Our work also takes us around the world to
   assist other nations prepare for and respond to volcano emergencies
   through the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program. Our strategy is to
   monitor earthquake activity, ground deformation, gas chemistry, and
   other geophysical and hydrologic conditions before, during, and after
   eruptions.

   We use these observations to detect activity leading to an eruption,
   provide real-time emergency information about future and ongoing
   eruptions, identify hazardous areas around active and potentially
   active volcanoes, and improve our understanding of how volcanoes erupt
   and change our environment.

    Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO)

   The Alaska Volcano Observatory has two locations in Anchorage and
   Fairbanks, Alaska. It is supported by the U.S. Geological Survey, the
   Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the
   Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys.


    USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO)

   The USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory is located in Vancouver,
   Washington. It is headquarters for the USGS Volcano Disaster Assistance
   Program, which is also supported by the U.S. Agency for International
   Development's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance.


    USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO)

   The USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory is located in Hawai`i Volcanoes
   National Park on the Big Island of Hawai`i.


    Long Valley Caldera Observatory

   Although not an actual "observatory," the USGS Long Valley Caldera
   Observatory manages the monitoring efforts for the Long Valley Caldera
   from the USGS Western Region Headquarters in Menlo Park, California.


    Yellowstone Volcano Observatory

   The Yellowstone Volcano Observatory is the most recent U.S. volcano
   observatory. The goal of the observatory is to improve the existing
   collaborative study and monitoring of active geologic processes and
   hazards of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field and its caldera. The
   Observatory is supported by the U.S. Geological Survey, University of
   Utah, and the Yellowstone National Park. The park was the world's first
   National Park
   . It contains the largest and most diverse collection of natural
   thermal features in the world.


                         Worldwide Volcanology Sites

   See an excellent reference list of Regional Volcanology Sites,
   including those maintained by the world's volcano observatories. The
   list is provided by the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism
   Program.
