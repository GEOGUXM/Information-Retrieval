   Military Academy Nominations
   [line.jpg]

   The privilege of nominating qualified New Mexicans to the Air Force,
   Army, Naval, and Merchant Marine Academies is one of my most important
   and gratifying responsibilities. This page contains information about
   the nomination and application process.  If your particular question is
   not answered, contact my Santa Fe office at 988-6647 or by e-mail at
   senator_bingaman@bingaman.senate.gov.

   One note:  In addition to contacting us, you will want to contact the
   academy or academies you are interested in.  They can send you a
   catalogue, a detailed explanation of their selection process, and
   useful suggestions for other actions you should take.  Good luck with
   your application!
