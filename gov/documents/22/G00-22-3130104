   Section A.

Purpose and Organization of the IDL Astronomy Library

   A1.  Where can I find out about stars, planets, black holes, galaxies
   etc.?

   Sorry, you've come to the wrong place. The IDL Astronomy Library is a
   collection of low-level software in the commercial language  IDL , and
   is mainly of interest to professional astronomers who already have
   purchased an IDL software license. For general questions about
   astronomy, one good starting point is the list of Web resources
   available at the WEBStars page at Goddard Space Flight Center.

   A2.  I haven't purchased an IDL license -- can I still use the Library?
   Can I use it with PV-WAVE?

   Sorry, the programs in the IDL Astronomy Library will not run without
   an IDL license.   You are welcome to use any of the programs as
   metacode and convert them to your favorite language.

    PV-WAVE  is a commercial programming language with similarities to
   IDL.    In fact, at one time (1990) it was an identical language to
   IDL, but has since evolved separately.       I do not attempt to make
   the programs in the IDL Astronomy Library  compatible with PV-WAVE, but
   since the IDL Astronomy Library has little use of widgets or
   object-oriented programming (see  A7 ), much of the code can probably
   still be converted to PV-WAVE without too much effort.

   A3.  How do I install the IDL Astronomy Library?

   The entire contents of the Library can be loaded from one of two .tar
   files or from a .zip file at the  FTP site .     The astron.dir.tar.gz
   file maintains the procedures in separate topical directories,  whereas
   the  astron.tar.gz file has the same files but with all the procedures
   in a single directory. The astron.zip file has identical contents to
   astron.tar.gz but in .zip format.

   The  procedures in the IDL Astronomy Library need simply be placed in a
   directory included in the IDL !PATH.     This can either be done at
   startup (using the UNIX/VMS system variable IDL_PATH or the
   Windows/Macintosh preferences file) or by simply concatenating the
   directory to the !PATH system variable.      Note that the procedures
   in the IDL Astro Library are not a self-contained "package" but rather
   a collection of low-level procedures to be incorporated with the user's
   own software.

   For historical reasons, many of the IDL Astronomy Library procedures
   use the following three  non-standard system variables.   These must
   first be defined with the  ASTROLIB procedure (or the equivalent DEFSYS
   definitions).
     *   !PRIV - Used in a couple of the database programs.   Needs to be
       set when  modifying a database.
     *   !TEXTOUT - Used in the program TEXTOPEN which is called by the
       database and several other programs.   Programs which use this
       non-standard system variable also allow a keyword TEXTOUT to be
       used instead of the  system variable
     *  !TEXTUNIT - Logical output unit number used by TEXTOPEN

   The procedure ASTROLIB also defines a default ASTRO_DATA data
   directory.       This directory contains a FITS file JPLEPH.405
   containing the JPL DE405 ephemeris, which is used by several routines
   (e.g. JPLEPHINTERP) to compute highly accurate positions and velocities
   of major solar system objects (including the Earth and the Sun).
   However, due to its size, the JPLEPH.405 file is not included in the
   standard .tar and .zip distributions of the IDL Astro Library .
   Thus, the use the JPL procedures the following two steps are required:

    1. FTP the files in http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/data/ to  your
       /data directory
    2. Define the environment variable ASTRO-DATA (and/or edit the
       ASTROLIB procedure) to point to your /data directory

   A4.  Who supports the IDL Astronomy Library?

   The IDL Astronomy Library has been supported by NASA under a small
   grant from the Astrophysics Data Program.   The first grant was awarded
   in 1990 to Wayne Landsman for three years, and the grant was renewed in
   1993 and 1996.    At various times, other people , including Frank
   Varosi, Krishna Venkatakrishna, and Joseph Lyu, have worked part-time
   on the Library.

   At the end of  November 2000, all funding for the IDL Astronomy Library
   ended.      An application to renew support for the IDL Astronomy
   Library was made to the NASA Applied Information Systems Research in
   September 2000 but was not successful.    The Library is currently
   supported by a small amount  of director's discretionary funding from
   Code 600 at Goddard Space Flight Center.  I am currently looking for
   other sources of funding.

   Many of the programs in the IDL Astronomy Library have been contributed
   by the user community.    In particular,  Don Lindler, Craig Markwardt,
   Tom McGlynn,  and Bill Thompson have made significant contributions to
   the Library.

   A5.  Which versions and platforms of IDL are supported by IDL Astronomy
   Library?

   The programs in the IDL Astronomy Library should work in  V5.1 and all
   later versions of IDL.       There is a separate  V4.0 version  of the
   Library that uses parentheses rather than square brackets for array
   indexing, as was required in IDL versions prior to V5.0 (released in
   1997).

   There is a V5.3 directory  which contains modifications of several IDL
   Astronomy Library procedures to use special features introduced in
   V5.3.  The procedures in the V5.3 directory will not work in earlier
   versions of IDL.

   I currently only have access to IDL on Unix (Solaris) and VMS machines,
   though I try to maintain Windows & Mac compatibility.

   A6.    Is there on online help file available for the IDL Astronomy
   Library?

   Each procedure contains a  documentation header.      Unfortunately,
   there is no easy way in IDL to link the documentation for user
   procedures with either the hypertext help or the Acrobat .PDF files
   used for intrinsic procedures.      One way to create help files is to
   use the standard IDL procedure MK_HTML_HELP to create an .html help
   file (or fetch the astron.html  file).       This help file can be
   awkward to use, due to its large size and lack of subcategories.     An
   alternative is to simply use the  one-line description of procedures,
   available at Goddard or in TÃ¼bingen or to mirror one of these sites
   locally.     Users of Emacs can use the excellent help facilities
   incorporated into the IDLWAVE mode.

   A7.   Why are there so few widget and object-oriented procedures in the
   IDL Astronomy Library?

   The emphasis of the IDL Astronomy Library is on low-level algorithms
   for astronomy (including FITS I/O).      The are many excellent Web
   sites for other aspects of IDL programming.   (Probably the three most
   widely used libraries for astronomers are  those of  David Fanning,
   Craig Markwardt,  and  Ray Sterner . )  Historically, widget procedures
   are also more difficult to maintain over different IDL platforms and
   versions.

   A8.  Are there known incompatibilities between the IDL Astronomy
   Library and other IDL Libraries?

      I am aware of the following procedure name conflicts:
    1. DATATYPE() -- This function was originally from the  JHUAPL
       Library  but diverged with the introduction of the new data types
       (e.g. unsigned integers).   The use of DATATYPE() is being phased
       out of the IDL Astronomy Library in favor of SIZE(/TNAME).
    2. TRIM() -- This function for trimming strings is duplicated from
       the  Solarsoft  library.  There is an entirely different  procedure
       named TRIM in the IUE library.   Therefore, while TRIM is kept in
       the IDL Astro Library, it is not required by any other procedure
    3. CONCAT_DIR() -- The version of this function in the  Solarsoft
       library contains some additional VMS-specific capabilities.
    4. FIND_ALL_DIR() -- Users with Windows and V5.2 or earlier should use
       the version in the Solarsoft  library.       The Solarsoft version
       is not duplicated in the Astro Library because it would require
       more than 20 supporting procedures.

   A9. Where can I find IDL software for a particular instrument?

   In general, the IDL Astronomy Library does not contain any
   instrument-specific software.   Check the  Links to other IDL Astronomy
   Sites  for IDL software for a particular instrument.     Please inform
   Wayne Landsman of any additions or corrections to this page.

   The one exception to the "no instrument specific" software for the IDL
   Astronomy Library has been for the WFPC2 (Wide Field/Planetary Camera)
   instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).      The exception is
   made because WFPC2 may be the most widely used astronomical instrument,
   and there is no other site supporting IDL software for it.

   A10.   How is configuration control (version numbers) maintained for
   the IDL Astronomy Library?

   Unfortunately, I do not have the facilities to maintain strict
   configuration control.    Procedures in the FTP site are updated as
   soon as a bug fix or enhancement has been implemented and tested for
   backwards compatibility.  The tar and zip files are updated roughly
   every month.     (Therefore, the ASCII file version of a procedure may
   be up to a month newer than what is found in the tar file.)    Every
   change is recorded in the "Revision History" section  of the
   documentation header, and is also recorded in the  news  file.

   Section B

   IDL Software  in Astronomy

   B1.   What astronomical image display widgets are available within IDL?

   I know of  three  sophisticated image display widgets written in IDL,
   that work with FITS files and recognize the world coordinate systems
   for astronomy.
    1. The  ATV Image Display Tool  is an IDL program written by Aaron
       Barth (CFA) modeled after the popular  SAOImage  image display
       utility.
    2. The object-oriented programs XCTV, XCTV2, XCTVN, XINSPECT,
       XINSPECT2 in  the  bhill  contrib directory of IDL Astronomy
       Library
    3. The program IDP3 (Image Display Paradigm 3) in the  NICMOS
       library

   Other   non-astronomical image display widgets might also be useful.
   The  LOOK widget by Fred Knight is easily extensible for including
   user-supplied code.  The  IMDISP  utility by Liam Gumley has been
   especially recommended for formatting images that look good both on the
   display and on the printer.

   B2.   Are there any IDL widgets for astronomical spectroscopy?

   I  recommend the IDL utilities available at the  FUSE  (Far-Ultraviolet
   Spectroscopic Explorer) software site.    The package contains widgets
   for continuum normalization, multiple Gaussian or Lorentzian fittings,
   and equivalent width measurements.

   B3. What IDL software is available for image deconvolution?

   The IDL astro programs  max_likelihood  and  max_entropy  have no
   method to determine when to stop the iterations,  though there is a
   very old widget interface  deconv_tool  to assist with visualization.
   The NICMOS library includes an interactive tool LUCY for
   Richardson-Lucy deconvolution.    IDL software for image reconstruction
   using the  PIXON  method is available on request. Jongchul Chae used
   IDL maximum entropy code to correct for stray light in solar
   filter-based magnetograph images.     The ANDRIL iterative
   deconvolution algorithm based on maximum likelihood was used for the
   Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT).

   B4. Will there be any updates to the IDLPHOT photometry package?

           The IDLPHOT library was written in 1990 and was based on the
   1987 version of the  DAOPHOT  photometry package.     Thus the code for
   PSF fitting is  awkward to use by modern standards, and for PSF-fitting
   I would recommend one of the modern non-IDL packages such as  DAOPHOT
   II or HSTPhot or DOPHOT .  However, some of the procedures in IDLPHOT
   such as mmm.pro to estimate a sky background, find.pro to locate point
   sources, and aper.pro to perform aperture photometry remain useful and
   easily cannibilized.     While some updates to aper.pro are planned
   (e.g. to recognize NAN values as bad pixels, and accept an error array)
   there are no immediate plans to improve the PSF fitting software.

   Other available IDL photometry packages include the following:
    1. STARFINDER - A PSF-fitting photometry program from Bologna for the
       analysis of well-sampled crowded stellar fields
    2. HIIPHOT - A software package by D. Thilker (NMSU, 2000 AJ, 120,
       3070 ) designed for accurate photometric characterization of H II
       regions.
    3.  CCDPHOT - Marc Buie's CCD Photometry program originally designed
       for solar system objects.
