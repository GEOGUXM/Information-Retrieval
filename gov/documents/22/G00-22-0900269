   Occupational credentials, such as a license or certification, have
   increasingly become a common requirement for many types of civilian
   jobs. Transitioning military personnel can face significant delays in
   employment or underemployment if they do not have the credentials they
   need.

   Because civilian credentialing requirements are typically based on
   traditional means of obtaining education, training, and experience in
   the civilian sector, servicemembers and veterans who received their
   career preparation in the military may have more difficulty obtaining a
   license or certificate than their civilian counterparts.

   To aid servicemembers and veterans in transitioning to the civilian
   workforce, this portion of the web site provides:

     * Answers to Frequently Asked Questions - Information about
       credentialing, including what it is, how it affects servicemembers
       and veterans, and what resources are available to assist them in
       becoming credentialed.
     * Meeting Civilian Credentialing Requirements - For 25 civilian
       occupations most relevant to transitioning military personnel,
       information on whether military training and experience meets
       civilian licensure and certification requirements. For other
       occupations, links to other information sources on licensure and
       certification requirements.

     * Jobs with Standardized Requirements - Information on selected
       occupations that, while not formally credentialed, have
       standardized employment requirements. These include, for example,
       postal service jobs, and a number of federal law enforcement
       positions.
