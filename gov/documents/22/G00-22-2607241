   Spin density wave (SDW) order and fluctuations associated with this low
   temperature phase of quasi one-dimensional conductors, such as
   (TMTSF)[2]PF[6], have been widely investigated for a substantial length
   of time. In part, this is because they reflect the static and dynamic
   properties of the pinned density wave phase and provide a means to
   compare these properties with theoretical models for their origin. One
   NMR measurement of interest is the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate
   1/T[1].

   For the ordered phase of the SDW not far below the SDW transition, it
   is generally agreed that thermally excited phase fluctuations of the
   pinned SDW (phasons) are responsible for 1/T[1]. In this regime, the
   phason fluctuations generate a fluctuating magnetic field whose power
   spectrum is frequency dependent. Since the fluctuation motion of the
   SDW also corresponds to polarization charge fluctuations of the
   condensed electrons that make up the SDW, according to one model,
   1/T[1]is proportional to the sum of the imaginary part of the SDW
   dielectric constant over all wave vectors at the NMR frequency. Thus,
   through measurements of 1/T[1] as a function of frequency, one
   investigates the dynamics of the pinned SDW charge fluctuations on
   different time scales.

   Two other regions of temperature are also of interest in this field...
