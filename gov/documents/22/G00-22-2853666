   UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
   ________________________________________ x In re: Expansion of General
   Order M-143 to x Include the Use of Early Neutral Evaluation x AMENDED
   GENERAL ORDER M-143 and Mediation/Voluntary Arbitration x x M-211
   ________________________________________x Whereas the "Alternative
   Dispute Resolution Act of 1998" found in 28 UCS§651 through §658 and
   Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure (FRBP) 9019 (c) authorize this
   court to adopt an alternative dispute resolution program and a
   voluntary arbitration program and the Board of Judges having agreed
   that the Court Annexed Mediation Program established by Amended General
   Administrative Order M 143 adopted January 18, 1995 and authorized by
   Local Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9019-1 Alternative Dispute
   Resolution should be expanded to include the use of Early Neutral
   Evaluation and Mediation/Voluntary Arbitration; and Whereas the Amended
   General Administrative Order established Rules 1.0 through 8.0 for
   mediation procedures; and Whereas Early Neutral Evaluation procedures
   utilize many mediation techniques, including the choice of an Early
   Neutral Evaluator by the same method contained in Rule 2.0 governing
   the selection of a mediator; and Whereas the court believes that a
   program of Mediation/Voluntary Arbitration may potentially reduce the
   number of disputes needing the attention of the court, thereby allowing
   the court to process remaining matters more efficiently; and Whereas
   the court wishes to encourage and promote, at appropriate stages in
   bankruptcy proceedings, the use of innovative, cost efficient, speedy
   methods of resolving disputes other than adjudication by a presiding
   judge; THEREFORE IT IS ORDERED that the court annexed mediation program
   is henceforth entitled the Court Annexed Alternative Dispute Resolution
   Program and is amended to include Early Neutral Evaluation under the
   same Rules 1.0 through 8.0 established for Mediation under the Amended
   General Administrative Order M-143 filed January 18, 1995. IT IS
   FURTHER ORDERED that the General Administrative Order M-143 is amended
   to include Mediation/Voluntary Arbitration under the following Rules:

   Stipulation of Parties. The court may refer a dispute pending before it
   to mediation, and, upon consent of the parties, to arbitration if and

   voluntary stipulation of the parties, the mediator, if qualified as an
   arbitrator, may hear and arbitrate the dispute. A. Referral to
   Arbitration pursuant to FRBP 9019 (c). Except as provided in

   proceeding, if the matter in controversy is greater than $150,000, the
   issue referred to arbitration is a procedural or non-dispositive issue.

   to final and binding arbitration, the court will retain jurisdiction to
   decide, after presentation of evidence, the adversary proceeding. B.

   the action shall be restored to the docket of the court and treated for
   all purposes as if had not been referred to arbitration. (c) Exclusion
   of Evidence of Arbitration. The court shall not admit at the

   evidence would otherwise be admissible in the court under the Federal
   Rules of Evidence; or (ii) The parties have otherwise stipulated. (3)
   Arbitration awards shall be entered as the judgment of the court after
   the time has expired for requesting a determination de novo. The

   that the judgment shall not be subject to review in any other court by
   appeal or otherwise. (1) Filing and Effect of Arbitration Award. The
   Clerk of the Court shall place under seal the contents of any
   arbitration award made under Rule 9.1 (B) of this Court Annexed
   Alternative Dispute Resolution Program and the contents shall not be
   known to any judge who might be assigned to the matter until the court
   has entered a final judgment in the action or the action has otherwise
   terminated. C. Safeguards in Consent to Voluntary Arbitration. Matters
   referred to mediation where the parties do not reach agreement are
   allowed to proceed to voluntary arbitration by consent expressly
