   A 3-Dimensional rendering of the top of the Planetary Boundary
   Layer(PBL) produced from LASAL derived PBL height measurements. The
   image shows a portion of the PBL top about 6 km wide by 15 km deep. The
   objective of the Boundary Layer Lidar project is to utilize scanning
   backscatter lidar measurements and other instrument data to study the
   structure and dynamics of the lower troposphere. Using aerosols as
   tracers of atmospheric motion, lidar is able to measure the convective
   structure and height of the PBL. A major use of this data is the
   verification and testing of PBL models. In addition, techniques have
   been developed that use the statisical distribution of cumulus cloud
   top height to retrieve the Lifting Condensation Level (LCL)and
   near-surface moisture over the oceans.. This provides a means of
   estimating latent and sensible heat flux over the tropical oceans when
   used in conjunction with surface wind data. Scanning Lidars provide
   data on the three dimensional structure and evolution of the PBL over
   complex terrain, the energy transport of atmospheric gravity waves, and
   the origin, dispersion, and transport of atmospheric aerosols,
   important parameteres in radiative transfer which strongly affects
   global heating and cooling. We activley seek out participation in
   related science investigations and develop collaborations to act as
   advocates for the generation and use of NASA lidar data sets to
   increase the knowledge of PBL processes.
