                      Converting From Paper Securities

                  Eight Reasons Why Book Entry Beats Paper

   Most investors already have converted their Treasury securities from
   paper to book-entry form. Three convenient programs make the switch
   easy: the Smart Exchange campaign; and for stripped bearer securities,
   the BECCS and CUBES initiatives.

   Why have so many people made the conversion to book entry? Here are
   some of the reasons:

     * Book-entry form is the "industry standard" for the marketable
       government securities market.
     * Owners of paper securities cant use customer-friendly
       TreasuryDirect Electronic Services.
     * Paper securities cannot be automatically reinvested.
     * Owners of paper securities cannot receive payments by direct
       deposit.
     * Owners of paper securities do not receive regularly scheduled
       account statements.
     * A paper security cannot be traded as fast or efficiently as a
       book-entry security.
     * Some financial institutions refuse to accept paper securities
       unless the owner indemnifies the bank against loss or theft.
     * After 2016, U.S. Treasury marketable securities in paper form no
       longer will exist.
