   Question: Why must I supply a CISE division for medium and large
   proposals? I thought all divisions participated, and that the
   solicitation went beyond pure-IT proposals.

   Answer: Small proposals will be administered by the respective
   divisions, but medium and large proposals will be administered
   centrally through the ITR Coordinating Group. Since CISE has
   administrative responsibility, only CISE divisions are shown. However,
   all divisions will participate in the review process, and proposals
   will be sorted upon receipt according to their respective research
   areas. For example, if your proposal centers on an ITR Scientific
   Frontiers area, you may select ACIR as the closest CISE division, but
   reviewers of the proposal will include persons representing the
   scientific discipline(s) that the application represents.

   Question: How do I chose an NSF Unit for medium and large pre-proposals
   and full proposals?

   Answer:  For institutions wishing to propose to the Information
   Technology Research initiative in response to NSF 01-149, the following
   method is recommended for selecting the NSF Unit for consideration for
   either preproposals or full proposals:

   First, choose NSF 01-149 Information Technology Research (ITR) from the
   list of program announcements on the cover sheet.  On the screen that
   follows, select the ITR Program first (ITR Small, ITR Medium, or ITR
   Large), then select the NSF Division.  You may note that the division
   list changes according to whether or not you have chosen ITR Small or
   one of the other two ITR programs.

   If you have chosen ITR Small, you may chose any NSF Unit appropriate to
   your proposal for primary consideration.  If you have chosen ITR Medium
   or Large, then you must select one of the NSF Computer and Information
   Science and Engineering (CISE) Directorate Divisions for primary
   consideration of your preproposal or proposal.

   Guideline for selecting an NSF CISE Directorate Division for medium and
   large proposals is: choose the CISE Division according to the ITR Major
   Technical Area that best fits the proposed effort (see Solicitation NSF
   01-149, Section "Program Description"). In general, the following CISE
   Divisions are recommended:

     *

   Software and Hardware Systems, choose primarily to C-CR, the Division
   of Computer-Communications Research, or ANIR, the Division of Advanced
   Networking Infrastructure and Research, or EIA, the Division of
   Experimental and Integrative Activities;
     *

   Augmenting Individuals and Transforming Society, choose IIS, the
   Division of Information and Intelligent Systems, or EIA, the Division
   of Experimental and Integrative Activities;
     *

   Scientific Frontiers and Information Technology, choose ACIR, the
   Division of Advanced Computational Infrastructure and Research, if the
   focus is on applications; IIS if the focus is data, and EIA for biology
   related proposals.

   The proposer may, however, choose any CISE division that seems
   appropriate to them for either the ITR Medium or ITR Large proposals or
   preproposals. This list is provided as only a set of recommended
   choices.

   NOTE:  after the primary CISE division has been selected, you may
   choose to select a secondary organizational unit from all of NSF.  As
   mentioned in the solicitation (Section V.A.), this information will be
   used by NSF in assigning the proposal for review.
