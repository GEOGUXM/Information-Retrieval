    Profile of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve


    SPR Bryan Mound Site
                        -

       The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is the nation's first line of
       defense against an interruption in petroleum supplies. It is an
       emergency supply of crude oil stored in huge underground salt caverns
       along the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico.

       Decisions to withdraw crude oil from the SPR during an energy emergency
       are made by the President under the authorities of the Energy Policy
       and Conservation Act. In the event of an energy emergency, SPR oil
       would be distributed by competitive sale. Although used for emergency
       purposes only once to date (during Operation Desert Storm in 1991), the
       SPR's current size (more than 544 million barrels) and the U.S.
       government's stated policy to withdraw oil early in a potential supply
       emergency make the SPR a significant deterrent to oil import cutoffs
       and a key tool of foreign policy.

       Origins

       The need for a national oil storage reserve has been recognized for at
       least five decades.

       Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes advocated the stockpiling of
       emergency crude oil in 1944. President Truman's Minerals Policy
       Commission proposed a strategic oil supply in 1952. President
       Eisenhower suggested an oil reserve after the 1956 Suez Crisis. The
       Cabinet Task Force on Oil Import Control recommended a similar reserve
       in 1970.

       But few events so dramatically underscored the need for a strategic oil
       reserve as the 1973-74 oil embargo. The cutoff of oil flowing into the
       United States from many Arab nations sent economic shockwaves
       throughout the Nation. In the aftermath of the oil crises, the United
       States established the SPR.

       President Ford set the SPR into motion when he signed the Energy Policy
       and Conservation Act (EPCA) on December 22, 1975. The legislation
       declared it to be U.S. policy to establish a reserve of up to 1 billion
       barrels of petroleum.

       The Gulf of Mexico was a logical choice for oil storage sites. More
       than 500 salt domes are concentrated along the coast. It is the
       location of many U.S. refineries and distribution points for tankers,
       barges and pipelines. In April 1977, the government acquired several
       existing salt caverns to serve as the first storage sites. Construction
       of the first surface facilities began in June 1977.

       On July 21, 1977, the first oil - approximately 412,000 barrels of
       Saudi Arabian light crude - was delivered to the SPR. Fill of the
       Nation's emergency oil reserve had begun.

       Current Status

       Today, the SPR has the capacity to hold 700 million barrels. It is the
       largest emergency oil stockpile in the world.  [Click to open current
       inventory window]. Together, the facilities and crude oil represent
       more than a $20 billion national investment.

       Fill was suspended in FY 1995 to devote budget resources to
       refurbishing the SPR equipment and extending the life of the complex
       through at least the first quarter of the next century. In 1999 fill
       was resumed in a joint initiative between the Departments of Energy and
       the Interior to supply royalty oil from Federal offshore tracts to the
       Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

       The Desert Storm Drawdown

       Stockpiling crude oil in the SPR reduces the nation's vulnerability to
       economic, national security, and foreign policy consequences of
       petroleum supply interruptions. The SPR proved its value in 1991 when a
       partial drawdown, coupled with a coordinated international supply
       response, dampened oil price hikes during the Persian Gulf War.

       On January 16, 1991, coinciding with the international effort to
       counter the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, President Bush ordered the
       first-ever emergency drawdown of the SPR. The Department of Energy
       immediately implemented a drawdown plan to sell 33.75 million barrels
       of crude oil, the United States' portion agreed to by the International
       Energy Agency.

       The drawdown proceeded on schedule and without major complications.
       Between the initial authorization and the final sale, however, world
       oil supplies and prices stabilized, and the United States reduced the
       sales amount to 17.3 million barrels which were sold to 13 companies.

       The Desert Storm drawdown and the price stability that resulted in
       world markets showed the merits of the U.S. policy of announcing its
       intent to draw upon its emergency stockpile early and in large
       quantities should the U.S. oil supply be threatened.

       Program Priorities

       In managing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Program, the Office of
       Fossil Energy's overriding objective is to maintain the readiness of
       the oil stockpile for emergency use at the President's direction.

       From 1993-2000, the Department of Energy's top priority was to ensure
       the continued readiness of the Reserve through at least the year 2025
       by conducting a major life-extension program. This included replacing
       or refurbishing pumps, piping and other key components at the SPR's
       Gulf Coast sites. The program was completed in March 2000 on schedule
       and below original cost estimates.
