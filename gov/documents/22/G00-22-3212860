                                General Uses:

     * Imaging rapidly moving dynamic events.

                          Examples of Applications:

     * Imaging the impact of a projectile in or on a target.
     * Imaging an explosively driven object during acceleration.
     * Observing the mechanics of detonation.

                                Test Samples:

   Samples are virtually any size. Penetration is limited to approximately
                      3 cm of steel or its equivalent.

                                Limitations:

      Contrast and resolution are not as good as that for conventional
       radiography because of the limited radiation available and the
   relatively large focal spot of the sources. It can also be difficult to
                  separate images from multiple exposures.

                         Estimated Evaluation Time:

   Setup requires approximately one 1/2 day and film processing generally
                           takes about 15 minutes.

                                 Principle:

    The radiation source is created by discharging a Marx bank (series of
     capacitors) into a field emission x-ray tube of low impedance. The
        pulse of radiation is approximately 30 nanoseconds long. Fast
    medical-type film, usually with fluorescent intensifying screens, is
          often used to produce images from the low radiation flux.

                                 Equipment:

        Units with peak energies from 150 keV to 1 MeV are available.
   As many as four units can be practically employed to provide multiple,
    progressive exposures of a single, dynamic event. Theroetically, more
                units can be employed if they are available.
