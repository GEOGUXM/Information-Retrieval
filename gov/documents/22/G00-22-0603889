   efficient and environmentally friendly, they aren't considered
   alternative fuel vehicles under Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct)
   regulations. To learn more about vehicles that can help you meet EPAct
   regulations, refer to the light- and heavy-duty alternative fuel
   vehicle section below.
