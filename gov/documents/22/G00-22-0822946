                             Halibut Management

   Pacific halibut is managed by the United States and Canada in a
   bilateral commission known as the International Pacific Halibut
   Commission (IPHC).  Each year, the IPHC sets total allowable catch
   levels for halibut that will be caught in the U.S. and Canadian
   Exclusive Economic Zones in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The IPHC
   refers to U.S. waters off the states of Washington, Oregon, and
   California collectively as "Area 2A."  Regulations for Area 2A are set
   in place by the National Marine Fisheries Service's Northwest Regional
   Office.  Halibut in Area 2A is divided between Tribal and non-Tribal
   fisheries, between commercial and recreational fisheries, and between
   recreational fisheries in different states. The Pacific Fishery
   Management Council describes this halibut catch division each year in a
   Catch Sharing Plan.
