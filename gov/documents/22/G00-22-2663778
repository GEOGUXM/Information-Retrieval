   The STAR (Strategic and Tactical Advocates for Results) Program is a
   major new initiative of the Federal Chief Information Officers (CIO)
   Council and the General Services Administration.

   STAR is a one-week resident seminar program focused on Program and
   Project Management, Leadership, Security, Technology, and Government.
   STAR focuses on tomorrow's government workplace - the highly strategic
   environment where operational functions are outsourced and agency
   business objectives and outcomes are key. STAR emphasizes Clinger-Cohen
   results-based management as well as "information technology as a
   strategic resource."

   STAR has very specific learning objectives. They are:
     * Strategic management skills
     * Strategic planning
     * Business planning
     * Technical infrastructure
     * Management structures
     * Policies and processes
     * Program and project management skills
     * Leadership skills
     * Organizational culture
     * Insight on outsourcing
     * Oversight organizations' functions
     * Technology trends

   Today's work environment is significantly changed. Operational work is
   outsourced. More partners are "at the table." "Stovepipes" are being
   replaced by cooperative partnerships. Strategic thinking and mission
   delivery is the responsibility of all. Information technology is
   changing at an even more rapid pace. Organizational boundaries are
   fading. Customers' expectations (i.e. demands) for information are
   immediate and broad. Security threats are ever present and rising in
   sophistication. Meanwhile, the government official still faces the
   usual challenges of tight budgets, reduced resources, competing
   priorities, and political influences. New knowledge, skills, and
   abilities are essential for today's government executive and manager to
   be effective into the next millennium. The STAR Program addresses these
   new skill requirements.

   Each candidate must be sponsored by an agency executive and hold GS-14,
   GS-15, or field GS-13 position, or be of comparable military rank.
