  This page highlights experiments whose results are now answering questions
  that may have remained a mystery without the help of microgravity. Through
  this web page, you can access the results of NASA research conducted in
  microgravity and learn how the research relates to everyday life.

  In each area of research, you can learn the background of the experiments, who
  conducted the research, and which spaceflights carried the experiment. This
  site also features research photos, links to related web sites, and a listing
  of journal articles on the research.

  Only a portion of the many successful microgravity flight experiments are
  described here, so keep checking this site for new additions to the research
  results page.
