                     The Birthplace of Civil Air Patrol

    New Jersey Wing is the state unit of the Civil Air Patrol, a national
     nonprofit benevolent organization with approximately fifty thousand
   members nationwide. The Civil Air Patrol is the Auxiliary of the United
    States Air Force. New Jersey Wing has approximately one thousand two
   hundred members statewide, consisting of cadet members who are between
    twelve and twenty one years old, and senior members who must be over
   eighteen years old.. Our members come from all walks of life, but most
   have an interest in aviation or the space program and/or enjoy helping
                our cadets grow into the leaders of America.
