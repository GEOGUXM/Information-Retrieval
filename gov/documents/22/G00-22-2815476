                       Welcome to the clickworkers study,

NASA Ames's experiment in volunteer science.

   The site has not been tested with the browser you are using. Crater
   marking only works in DOM-compliant browsers such as Netscape 6 and
   Mozilla, and in IE (Mac or Windows). Try crater classification; it
   should work in almost any browser.

[clickworker-age-map.gif] New science product

   Clickworker crater-marking inputs have been combined into a map of the
   ages of different regions of Mars. It agrees fairly closer with what
   was already known from traditional crater counting.

Whats next for the clickworkers project?

    1. Exciting news for the long term:The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter,
       which launches in August 2005 and reaches Mars in March 2006, will
       be involving clickworkers in its image analysis, and possibly in
       selecting some of the image locations. We may have some clickwork
       for you even before launch, but we dont yet know when.
    2. Short term prospects (2002):
          + The clickworkers pilot study produced some very impressive
            results over the past year.
          + Because of that, we have submitted a proposal to continue and
            expand on this work.
          + Any decision on continued funding wont be made until February
            or March 2002. Our proposal will be peer-reviewed, along with
            others, by a panel of scientists, and NASA Headquarters will
            then decide which ones it should allocate its money to.
          + If its funded, well be looking for gullies, among other
            things, and we may be able to use not only images but also the
            data that Mars Odyssey will soon be sending back. Well also
            be expanding to other worlds beyond Mars.
          + Even if thats not funded, well still be starting something
            new within the new few years. See above, and watch this site
            for another upcoming announcement.

   You might want to visit the site at least once a month -- not only to
   check for news, but so that it remembers how much work you did. (We may
   continue to track this, or we may start the new project with a fresh
   database , but if you dont visit monthly it will definitely forget
   which work you did.)

What can you do right now?

   All the activities are still up and running, although some have already
   served their purpose.
     * The ones that are still likely to be useful are:
          + You can mark never-before-catalogued craters in images
            recently acquired by MGS, which is currently in Mars orbit on
            a mapping mission. Please take the training session to learn
            how to mark craters. Then read the introduction and start
            marking. Note that you may need to set a size limit if the
            images are too big for you or your computer to deal with.
          + We are still interested in seeing how well you clickworkers
            can do on crater classification using the new richer system --
            please see the training material and give it a try.
     * You can still do any of the other activities if you want to. Were
       unlikely to learn anything new from them, but you never know.
          + Craters in the Viking Orbiter Mars Digital Image Mosaic have
            already been marked 40 or 50 times over, more than enough to
            prove the point, but you can do more if you want to. Be sure
            to try the training session.
          + If you like, you can try the old fresh/degraded/ghost
            classification system, but we have plenty of entries already.
          + The honeycomb search failed to turn up any new examples of
            honeycomb terrain, according to Dr. Moore. Perhaps they really
            dont exist. When given the one known example theyve already
            seen (but upside down), 69% of clickworkers identified it as
            honeycomb. The most common false identifications are layered
            deposits in the polar regions being mistaken for honeycomb.
          + You can still try Mars Pathfinder magnet images just for fun.
     * You can still see the old main page with details on the amount of
       data gathered.

What is this site all about?

   There are many scientific tasks that require human perception and
   common sense, but may not require a lot of scientific training.
   Identifying craters on Mars is something almost anyone can do, and
   classifying them by age is only a little harder.

   From November 2000 to September 2001, we ran an experiment that showed
   that public volunteers (clickworkers), many working for a few minutes
   here and there and others choosing work work longer, can do some
   routine science analysis that would normally be done by a scientist or
   graduate student working for months on end. Some of the results are
   available online.

   Theres more to come! Meanwhile, the site is continuing to gather data.

   You can change your background preference and the maximum size of MOC
   image you will accept.
