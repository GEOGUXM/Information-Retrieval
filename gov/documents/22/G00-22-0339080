   Rainbow Bridge - Lake Powell Cross cultural medicine offers unique
   opportunities for service and at the same time it offers individual
   growth for those serving. While new employees of the Navajo Area Indian
   Health Service may have been exposed to cross cultural environs as they
   grew up, during academic training, or previously in their professional
   careers, exposure to diverse peoples only partially prepares one for
   life among the Din√© (the Navajo People). The subtleties of
   interpersonal relationships (which, when understood by health
   professionals make them more successful in caring for patients) are
   particularly important among the Navajo.
