   Implementation Plan for the Lead Center for Microgravity Research
   NASA's Strategic Plan calls for the agency's Biological and Physical
   and Research Enterprise (BPR) to contribute new scientific knowledge by
   studying the effects of low gravity (microgravity) on important
   biological, chemical, and physical processes to improve the quality of
   life on Earth and to advance the presence of humans in space. The
   agency's Microgravity Research Program (MRP) and Space Product
   Development (SPD) program work to further these goals through
   investigations in microgravity. Combined with ground-based microgravity
   research, microgravity investigations in space allow scientists to
   study phenomena and processes that are normally masked by Earth's
   gravity.

   NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) serves as the agency's lead
   center for microgravity research. The center's Microgravity Research
   Program Office (MRPO) manages NASA's microgravity initiatives as
   defined by both the Microgravity Research Division and the Space
   Product Development Division of the Office of Life and Microgravity
   Sciences and Applications at NASA headquarters. The MRPO also oversees
   an integrated program of microgravity research among NASA field centers
   and promotes activities at affiliated Commercial Space Centers.

   The MRP is executed through peer-reviewed science investigations,
   flight- and ground-hardware development, and technical and mission
   support activities. The program supports investigations in the
   scientific disciplines of biotechnology, combustion science, fluid
   physics and transport phenomena, fundamental physics, and materials
   science. It also manages microgravity research support activities,
   which include acceleration measurement, advanced technology development
   and transfer, and the glovebox flight program. The SPD program promotes
   industry participation in NASA's space activities and facilitates the
   use of space for the development of commercial products and services.
   SPD programmatic areas include agribusiness, biotechnology, and
   materials research and development.
