     Accessibility Statement
       _______________________________________________________________

     USDA - ARS is committed to making its web sites accessible to all
     USDA customers and employees. All of the agency web sites are
     undergoing review and redesign as necessary to ensure that they meet
     or exceed the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act
     of 1973.

     Many of our web sites currently meet the Section 508 accessibility
     standards. Furthermore, USDA continues to work on making all web
     sites accessible. Thank you very much for your patience through this
     redesign process. If you have any comments or suggestions for
     improvement, please contact the Web Master of this page.
