   Executive Order 13158 mandates that the U.S. Departments of Commerce
   and the Interior "publish and maintain a list of MPAs that meet the
   definition of MPA for the purposes of this order." The Order further
   defines a Marine Protected Area (MPA) as "any area of the marine
   environment that has been reserved by Federal, State, territorial,
   tribal, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for
   part or all of the natural and cultural resources therein." To provide
   this information, an inventory of existing U.S. marine managed areas
   (MMAs) is being developed. The inventory will be used to inform federal
   agencies of the locations of sites, examine the effectiveness of our
   current system of protected areas, and help determine habitats that are
   in need of improved or additional protection measures. The Inventory
   will require the collection of information in close collaboration with
   agencies at all levels of government (see Seeking Public Comment).

   This section of the Web site will provide access to the Inventory and
   other information on marine managed areas. Presently, it defines terms
   that describe the list and supporting inventory, describes the process
   that is being developed to produce the list, and presents an initial
   and very partial inventory of marine managed areas (see definitions
   below) comprised primarily of federal sites, such as national parks and
   national marine sanctuaries. Additional information will be added as it
   becomes available.

   Definitions of Terms

   The term "marine protected area" is very common in natural resource and
   conservation literature where it has been defined and used in different
   ways. For the purposes of this Web site, marine protected areas are
   defined by the Executive Order, and associated with that definition are
   particular requirements on federal agencies (see How Will the MPA List
   Be Used). Thus, it is very important for sites meeting the definition
   of the Executive Order to be clearly identified.

   To avoid ambiguity and confusion with the more general term, "marine
   protected area," the following terms are defined:
     * MPA List. The formal list of marine areas to be "published and
       maintained" by the Departments of Commerce and the Interior, as
       called for in Executive Order 13158. The MPA List has not been
       developed at this time.
     * MPA List Site. A site that meets the definition for marine
       protected area, as specified in the Executive Order, and is on the
       MPA List (MPA List Site Working Definition and Operational Criteria
       - DRAFT). No MPA List Sites have been identified at this time.

   Many areas of U.S. marine waters receive some level of management
   protection. For this Web site, these areas are defined as Marine
   Managed Areas. The Departments of Commerce and the Interior are
   gathering information on these areas into a database.

   The following definitions apply:
     * Marine Managed Areas (MMA) Inventory. A database of existing U.S.
       sites that meet the definition of MPA in the Executive Order.
       Presently, the inventory contains primarily federal sites, such as
       national parks, wildlife refuges, and sanctuaries.
     * Marine Managed Areas (MMA) Inventory Site. A site in the Marine
       Managed Areas Inventory.

   This section includes direct access to the initial MMA Inventory (see
   Query the Inventory), which is based on submittals from the Departments
   of Commerce and the Interior, and two states.

   Some sites in the MMA inventory will not meet all of the criteria
   necessary for designation as MPA List Sites. The MMA Inventory will
   maintain these sites in the database to provide managers, analysts, and
   other interested parties with additional information that will be
   useful in independent assessments related to the national MPA system.

   How Will the MPA List Be Used?

   This MPA List and larger MMA Inventory will serve three core purposes:
     * Providing Information and Tools for Environmental Assessments. The
       MPA List and Inventory is intended to support independent analyses
       and studies of a wide variety of marine issues by governmental and
       nongovernmental users. These include state and local managers,
       scientists, conservation organizations, industry and user groups,
       other stakeholders, the media, and international organizations
       concerned with regional and global ocean conservation.
     * Designing the National MPA System. The MPA List and additional
       areas in the MMA Inventory will provide the foundation for the
       coming public and private effort to evaluate needs for future
       protection in our oceans. For that reason, the database underlying
       the inventory is being designed to allow objective analyses of the
       nationÂ’s existing protected and managed sites.
     * Avoiding Harm to MPAs. Centralized, easily accessed information on
       the location and conservation purposes of individual MPA List Sites
       will support federal agencies in meeting their obligation under
       Section 5 of the Executive Order, Agency Responsibilities, which
       stipulates: "Each Federal agency whose actions affect the natural
       or cultural resources that are protected by an MPA shall identify
       such actions. To the extent permitted by law and to the maximum
       extent practicable, each Federal agency, in taking such actions,
       shall avoid harm to the natural and cultural resources that are
       protected by an MPA."

   Seeking Public Comment

   Developing a comprehensive MPA List and MMA Inventory is a complex task
   that will take time and resources to complete. However, significant
   work has already been accomplished, and public comment is being sought
   at this time. The Departments of Commerce and the Interior will seek
   public comment on:
     * the operational definition of "marine protected area" that will be
       used to select MPA List Sites (see MPA List Site Working Definition
       and Operational Criteria - DRAFT); and
     * the information that will be gathered for the MPA List (see MPA
       Inventory Database Field Information - DRAFT).

   Information Provided by This Site

   Two information products are presented here:
     * The MMA Inventory. This is a preliminary inventory of sites that
       meet the definition of MPA in the Executive Order. The Inventory is
       under development and currently includes federal and federal/state
       partnership sites, and selected state sites in the Gulf of Maine
       region. Submitting agencies provided an initial screening according
       to the operational criteria comprising the working definition for
       MPAs (see MPA List Site Working Definition and Operational Criteria
       - DRAFT); and
     * Data Tools. These are examples of data tools that draw from this
       preliminary database to illustrate the future uses and analytical
       capabilities of the inventory.

   The four sections highlighted below provide more detailed information
   on how the MPA List and MMA Inventory are being constructed, and
   demonstrate how this information may be presented and accessed through
   this Web site.
     * Building the Inventory describes the draft working definition of
       MPA List Sites, the type of information that will be collected
       about each site to form the database, and the work ahead.
     * Status of the Inventory presents the sites compiled to date,
       organized by level of government.
     * Query the Inventory demonstrates some of the ways in which users
       will be able to retrieve meaningful information and patterns from
       the MPA List and larger MMA Inventory.
     * Selected Locator Maps provides maps showing the location, by
       program type, of many of the sites presently in the MMA Inventory.
