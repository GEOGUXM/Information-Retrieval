   The National Spent Nuclear Fuel (NSNF) Lessons Learned program and this
   home page are provided to promote an open exchange of lessons learned
   information for the benefit of all spent nuclear fuel (SNF)
   professionals. This web site is designed to specialize in SNF
   information and supplements any existing U.S. Department of Energy
   (DOE) and Site lessons learned programs. We invite you to contribute
   your lessons learned to this archive of SNF information and access it
   frequently as a reference source for valuable information. If you have
   questions or comments about the Lessons Learned program or this home
   page, please contact Sheryl Morton by e-mail at slm@inel.gov or by
   phone at 208-526-8247.
