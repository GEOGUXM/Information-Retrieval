Core Library and Data Center

   The Core Library and Data Center at Mercury, Nevada, was established as
   a repository for geologic, hydrologic, and geophysical data and
   materials collected in support of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
   defense and environment programs at the Nevada Test Site (NTS). The
   Core Library is operated by the U.S. Geological Survey and has been
   used as a staging area for many scientific studies throughout the south
   western United States, in addition to NTS.

   The Core Library houses drill-bit cuttings, drill core (both vertical
   and horizontal), geophysical logs, and other rock samples collected
   mostly from NTS. Some samples are from other DOE facilities in New
   Mexico, Mississippi, Colorado, Louisiana, Alaska and other areas in
   Nevada. Currently, the Core Library stores more than 2,000,000 linear
   feet of cores and cuttings.

   Included within the facility is a small reference library with
   approximately 2,500 publications pertaining to the Nevada Test Site and
   surrounding area. Most of the publications were prepared by the U.S.
   Geological Survey in cooperation with the Department of Energy;
   however, some are publications by past and present contractors to DOE.
