   Introduction An MTP is a passive microwave radiometer that measures
   the  thermal emission and absorption from oxygen molecules in the
   atmosphere along the instrument's line of sight, and then uses this
   information to retrieve a vertical profile of temperature by assuming
   horizontal temperature stratification and by using an atmospheric
   microwave opacity model. [In this link, the three altitudes of 0 km, 10
   km, and 20 km are representative of ground based, DC8 and ER2/WB57
   projects. This absorption model is from P.W. Rosenkranz, Ch. 2 and
   Appendix, in Atmospheric Remote Sensing  By Microwave Radiometry, M.A.
   Janssen, Editor, New York : Wiley, 1993. ]. Because any oxygen emission
   is absorbed in proportion to its distance from the radiometer, the
   integrated emission can be represented by a "weighting function" which
   characterizes the weighted mean distance of the emission. In the
   special case where the temperature lapses at a constant rate with
   distance, it is easy to show that the brightness temperature measured
   by the radiometer is exactly equal to the physical temperature at the
   e-folding distance for the absorption. More complicated situations
   require more detailed treatment.

   An MTP generally consists of two assemblies: a sensor unit (SU), which
   receives and detects the signal, and a data unit (DU), which controls
   the SU and records the data. In addition, on some platforms there may
   be a third element, a real-time analysis computer (RAC), which analyzes
   the data to produce temperature profiles and other data products in
   real time. The SU is connected to the DU with power, control, and data
   cables. In addition the DU has interfaces to the aircraft navigation
   data bus and the RAC, if one is present.

   Navigation data is needed so that information such as altitude, pitch
   and roll are available. Aircraft altitude is needed to perform
   retrievals (which are altitude dependent), while pitch and roll are
   needed for controlling the position of a stepper motor which must drive
   a scanning mirror to predetermined elevation angles. Generally, the
   feed horn is nearly normal to the flight direction and the scanning
   mirror is oriented at 45-degrees with respect to receiving feed horn to
   allow viewing from near nadir to near zenith. At each viewing position
   a local oscillator (LO) is sequenced through two or more frequencies.
   Since a double sideband receiver is used, the LO is generally located
   near the "valley" between two spectral lines, so that the upper and
   lower sidebands are located near the spectral line peaks to ensure the
   maximum absorption. This is especially important at high altitudes
   where "transparency" corrections become important if the lines are too
   "thin."

   Because each frequency has a different effective viewing distance, the
   MTP is able to "see" to different distances by changing frequency. In
   addition, because the viewing direction is also varied and because the
   atmospheric opacity is temperature and pressure dependent, different
   effective viewing distances are also achieved through scanning in
   elevation. If the scanning is done so that the applicable altitudes
   (that is, the effective viewing distance times the sine of the
   elevation angle) at different frequencies and elevation angles are the
   same, then inter-frequency calibration can also be done, which improves
   the quality of the retrieved profiles. For a two-frequency radiometer
   with 10 elevation angles, each 15-second observing cycle produces a set
   of 20 brightness temperatures, which are converted by a linear
   retrieval algorithm to a profile of air temperature versus altitude,
   T(z).

   Finally, radiometric calibration is performed using  the outside air
   temperature (OAT) and a heated reference target to determine the
   instrument gain. However, complete calibration of the system to include
   "window corrections" and other effects, requires tedious analysis and
   comparison with radiosondes near the aircraft flight path. This is
   probably the most important single factor contributing to reliable
   calibration. For stable MTPs, like that on the DC8, such calibrations
   appear to be reliable for many years. Such analysis is always performed
   before MTP data are placed on mission archive computers.

   DC8 The JPL DC8 Microwave Temperature Profiler (MTP/DC8) is a passive
   microwave radiometer that measures the natural thermal emission from
   oxygen molecules at three frequencies (55.51, 56.66 and 58.79 GHz). The
   instrument views ten elevation angles between -80 and +80 degrees by
   using a scanning mirror, located behind a microwave window on the
   sensor unit, to change the viewing direction. The sensor unit is
   located in a window just aft of the forward starboard exit door. This
   window has always been considered inaccessible for science instruments
   or inlets because it is immediately behind the Mission Manager's
   console. The sensor fairing is far enough ahead of other useable
   windows that it should not interfere with any future sampler inlets.
   The control and analysis electronics for the MTP are located in the
   Mission Manager's rack. The MTP retrieves profiles of air temperature
   versus altitude, which it displays on a dedicated color LCD display
   beside the Mission Manager's console; a video signal is also available
   for distribution to DADS monitors throughout the aircraft.

  Introduction

   The airborne MTP/ER2 instrument is a passive microwave radiometer that
   measures thermal emission from oxygen molecules along the viewing
   direction. A stepper motor rotates a 45-degree shaped reflector so that
   radiation entering a receiving horn is sequenced through a set of 10
   elevation angles, ranging from +58 to +60 degrees (within a vertical
   plane that is offset l5 degrees in azimuth from the direction of
   flight). At each viewing position a local oscillator is sequenced
   through two frequencies: 56.66 and 58.80 GHz. Each 14-second observing
   cycle produces a set of 20 brightness temperatures, which are converted
   by a linear retrieval algorithm to a profile of air temperature versus
   altitude. Altitude coverage is 15 to 25 km while flying at 19 km. T(z)
   profiles are obtained every 2.9 km along the flight path.

  Science

   T(z) data can be used to derive a "curtain cross-section" of the
   temperature field along the flight path . Regions cold enough to
   condense water vapor, or nitric acid, can be identified (with mixing
   ratio assumptions). The temperature field is also used to derive
   cross-sections of isentrope surface altitudes, which can be used to
   locate mountain waves. "Waviness" of the isentrope surface altitudes
   can also be used to quantify the mesoscale vertical motions of air
   parcels and their associated temperature fluctuations. Temperature
   fluctuations are needed to determine an effective temperature for those
   chemical reactions and solubilities which vary in a strongly non-linear
   manner with temperature. The tropopause altitude can be located along
   the flight path when the aircraft is within about 3 km of the
   tropopause, which often occurs during brief descent/ascents midway in a
   flight.

  History

   The MTP/ER2 was used during the 1987 Airborne Antarctic Ozone
   Experiment, AAOE, the 1989 Airborne Arctic Science Experiment, AASE,
   the 1992 Airborne Arctic Science Experiment, AASE II, and the 1994
   Airborne Southern Hemisphere Ozone Experiment. Measurements for
   Assessing the Effects of Stratospheric Aircraft, ASHOE/MAESA, based in
   New Zealand and Hawaii. AAOE measurements led to the discovery and
   quantitative characterization of mountain waves in the lower
   stratosphere over the Antarctic Peninsula. AASE measurements led to the
   discovery and quantification of an ever-present component of mesoscale
   vertical motions in the lower stratosphere, which has implications for
   polar stratospheric cloud formation and drop size evolution. AASE II
   measurements were used to validate a model for mountain wave production
   (and CAT breakdown), which has implications for momentum flux transfer
   to the stratosphere. ASHOE/MAESA measurements led to the discovery that
   filaments sometimes produce a distortion to the temperature field, and
   this may provide a means for studying filament entrainment and
   transport.

WB57

   MTP will fly for the first time on the NCAR WB57 in March 1998 on the
   WB57 Aerosol Mission (WAM). The sensor unit and data unit are the ER2
   instrument. An old superpod fairing has been modified to allow scanning
   from +70 to -70 degrees. In addition, a real time analysis computer
   (WAC) has been added and DC8 realtime analysis code modified so that
   the back seat scientist can have realtime tropopause altitude guidance.
