   FEDERAL REGISTER . INTRODUCTION The Department of Transportation (DOT)
   issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM), notice 90-10
   published in the Federal Register on March 6, 1990. The notice
   (attached in Appendix D) posed nine questions designed to solicit
   public comments concerning the feasibility of providing accessible
   lavatories in single-aisle aircraft with 200 passenger seats or fewer.
   Current regulations apply only to new production deliveries or
   refurbishment of twin-aigle.aircraft. : .: Few.comments were received
   on'the GPRM: Consequently, DOi' . . established the Aircraft
   Accessibility Federal Advisory ' Committee. The purpose of the
   Committee was to provide guidance to DOT concerning access to
   lavatories on single-aisle aircraft. ,for persons with disabilities,
   including persons who use wheelchairs. Accordingly,- Committee members
   representing airlines, airframe manufacturers, disability advocacy
   groups, professional organizations, aviation safety organizations and
   relevant Federal agencies were appointed (A list of Committee members
   and other participants is provided at Appendix C.) The Committee held
   its first meeting July 29-30, 1992. Additional meetings were held
   September 16-17, December 9-10, and March 31- April 1; 1993. i The
   Committee visited aircraft, reviewed aircraft configuration studies,
   -discussed policy issues-, and reviewed a report defining "Functional
   Categories of Persons with Disabilities and Opera- tional Dimensions
   for Designing Accessible Aircraft Lavatories."l Discussions on spatial
   and physical needs were described by Committee members with
   disabilities, including the importance of related assistive equipment,
   sinks, and other common amenities in the accessible lavatory. Contained
   herein are the comments, findings, and advice of the Committee members
   concerning further rulemaking to implement the Air Carrier Access Act
   of 1986 with respect to accessible lavatories on single-aisle aircraft.
   '"Functional Categories of Persons with Disabilities and Operational
   Dimensions for Designing Accessible Aircraft Lavatories" is the title
   of a document prepared by C. Gerald Warren and Teresa Valois for the
   Paralyzed Veterans of America, National Easter Seal Society, National
   Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the United-Cerebral Palsy Associations,
   Inc. DEFINITION OF- TERMS' A. Assistive Equipment - Physical features
   that are used by passengers with disabilities, including visual and
   hearing impairments, e.g., hand bars, hand grips, platforms, signage,
   and lighting to facilitate their use of the lavatory. Platforms are
   horizontal proj.ections (frequently molded in) from a nearby wall that
   may be used for support in the manner of hand grips or hand rests. B. .
   ., Call Button - .The control switch in the lavatory used to ' ,.
   illuminate the flight attendant call light. . .. . C. Call Light - A
   readily visible light outside of the lavatory ' ' enclosure that can be
   illuminated by the use of the call button in the lavatory to advise a
   flight attendant to assist a passenger. D. Lavatory - A facility
   customarily used by passengers for their hygienic functions and
   appearance needs. E. Lavatory Enclosure - An auxiliary area contiguous
   to a lavatory that'can be separated from the passenger cabin so as to
   provide an extended area for privacy and maneuverabilitzy for
   passengers with disabilities. F. Sink and Amenities - The sink (or wash
   basin) along with a drain control and a faucet assembly to provide hot
   or cold water for washing needs. Amenities typically include toilet
   paper, soap, paper towels, and a vanity mirror. G. Toilet Flush Control
   - A switch that initiates the toilet flushing cycle. H. Transfer - The
   physical movement of a passenger between a passenger. seat, an.on-board
   wheelchair, and/or a lavatory toilet seat. Some-passengers can-perform
   an independent transfer using appropriate handrails, platforms;etc.
   'Others need physical 'assistance from another person to perform a
   dependent transfer. For passengers in the latter category, a variety of
   techniques may be used to lift the passengers clear off one seat, move
   them until they are over the other seat, and then lower the passengers
   into a seated position. A passeng.er's angular change of position is
   expressed in terms of "degrees of transfer," e.g., in a 90 degree
   transfer, a passenger is pivoted through a 90 degree arc. In a zero
   degree or lateral transfer, a passenger transfers laterally from seat
   to seat. It must be noted that there is a wide variety of transfer
   techniques and toileting methods, each with its own spatial
   requirements. The space required for a 90 degree transfer of a 97.5
   percent male with a personal attendant 2 . . who is also a 97.5 percent
   male should accommodate the needs of most other passengers with
   disabilities who use transfer techniques different from those described
   herein, whose method of using the toilet may not require transfer, or
   who use mobility aids. I. Signage - An accessible lavatory provides
   signage for individuals with visual impairments or who are blind. J.
   Warnings - Visual and audible warnings, are needed so that .indjviduals
   with visual. or hearing disabilities.'may be,instructed., . ,- to leave
   the lavatory when necessary. ,a . .' . . . . ' HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL
   FACTORS A. Physical Characteristics of Users - Accessible lavatories,
   while modified for the needs of passengers with disabilities, c a n .
   be used by all passengers. The underlying presumption is that the
   purpose of the design is to make the lavatory accessible to and usable
   by adult passengers who must be transported in an on- board wheelchair
   to reach the lavatory. B. Aircraft Operating Environment - Consistent
   with 14 CFR Part 382.39, a flight attendant will assist the passenger
   in khe use of an on-board wheelchair, and operation of the
   lavatory/enclosure, but not passenger lifting within the lavatory or
   personal hygienic needs. RESPONSE TO ANPRM The Committee accepts as a
   basic principle that people with disabilities are entitled to levels of
   privacy, dignity, and independence equivalent to those afforded all
   passengers of commercial aircraft. The Air Carrier Access Act prohibits
   air carriers from discriminating.on the basis of disability, and these
   factors are,critical to meaningful implementation of the Act: While the
   Committee's-charter was to provide guidance concerning lavatory access
   on single-aisle aircraft with fewer than 200 passenger seats, further
   direction by DOT, as .well as the background of the Committee's
   membership limited the scope of the study to single-aisle aircraft with
   100 or more passenger seats. Given that direction, the work of the
   Committee focused on a series of airframe manufacturer design studies
   which were based on the "Suggested Guidelines for Accessible Lavatories
   in Twin . 3 Aisle Aircraft.'12 It was recognized that significant
   differences exist in the,space available on single aisle aircraft
   versus that available on twin-aisle aircraft. However, it was
   determined that it is possible to design lavatories for single-aisle
   aircraft with 100 or more seats which will accommodate persons with
   disabilities, including people who3use wheelchairs and require a 90
   degree dependent transfer. The Committee's review also revealed that
   the easiest and least ,expensive solutions tended to have.
   the,great-e.st impact. on cabin service and passenger flow, as well as
   limiting the accessibi$ity f . . _- provided to the lavatory.
   (Reference Design Concepts C and'D,- -__ :. Appendix A) G Solutions
   requiring extensive aircraft redesign tended to be more expensive in
   terms, of both revenue loss and manufacturing costs but provided for
   little to no disruption to _ passengers, cabin service, and other crew
   duties. (Reference Design Concepts A and B, Appendix A). These
   solutions also tended to provide the highest degree of accessibility.
   Following is a discussion of the nine issues on which DOT requested
   advice and the Committee's response to those issues, explaining the
   foregoing statements in more detail. Advice on : / 1. The degree to
   which it is possible to design for placement in a narrow-body aircraft
   a lavatory that will accommodate persons with disabilities, including
   those who use wheelchairs. 2. For the various cabin configurations of
   different aircraft types with. fewer than 200 seats, what physical
   layouts are possible to offer passengers at least visual privacy and
   the ability to maneuver in the lavatories? 2"Suggested Guidelines for
   Accessible Lavatories in Twin-Aisle Aircraft" is the title of a
   document prepared by an ad hoc working group comprised of
   representatives from airframe manufacturers airlines, disability
   advocacy groups, and Federal agencies. The Air Transport Association of
   America. maintains administrative control of the document. 3Fokker
   Aircraft representatives noted that dependent transfers are not
   possible in all cases due to space limitations in existing lavatory
   locations on some models of aircraft. 4 ... Comments: Drawing on the
   data in the "Suggested Design Guidelines for Accessible Lavatories in
   Twin-Aisle Aircraft" the Committee requested airframe manufacturers to
   provide layouts for a series of possible designs for different aircraft
   models with seating capacity of 100 to 199 seats. (Ref: Appendix A).
   The Committee reviewed those extensively at the September 16-17, 1992
   meeting of the Advisory Committee. Rather than reviewing detailed
   lavatory des,igns, the Committee focused on the-issue.of floor ., _
   space to ascertain if accessibility were feasible.: The .follow:ing ._
   _ ._ findings presume the use of a compatible'on-2board.wheelchair.- .
   ,-. a. Some aircraft types have structural elements which intrude into
   the cabin, such as the MD80 and Fokker 100 engine bulkhead mounts,
   and/or equipment placements which will limit enlargement of .lavatories
   in existing locations. b. On smaller aircraft, design, weight and
   balance considerations may constrain space availability and location,
   thus limiting the degree. of accessibility. C . Current lavatory
   configurations exist on all aircraft types which, with minor privacy
   improvements, wou.ld provide 180 degree independent transfer
   capability. (Ref. Design Concept D, Appendix A). d. Lavatories can be
   made more accessible by utilizing enclosures, which incorporate entry
   door space, aisle space, and galley work space, to create the
   accessible lavatory. In such cases, the wheelchair within the enclosure
   will project outside the lavatory door for approximately one-half of
   its overall dimension. In some cases, the wheelchair will project into
   enclosed aisle space or areas near exit doors. e. Configurations using
   lavatory enclosures which fully contain the wheelchair may provide
   equivalent privacy. Certain types of enclosures do not provide such
   level of privacy. . Another option would be to widen lavatory door
   openings and use the larger door to form one portion of a privacy
   barrier. This might be done in conjunction with some type of flexible
   barrier. In some aircraft, improvements in providing these types of
   privacy areas can be enhanced by relocating the lavatory door opening
   to another side of the module; thus changing the area to be used from
   an aisle to a doorway area. ' . f. The space required to.accomplish
   accessibility may vary from that provided by the "Twin Aisle
   Guidelines." Such variations may be possible with appropriate placement
   of walls, counter tops, and assistive devices to facilitate the
   transfer process. Variations can be verified by equivalent
   facilitation. ' 5 Advice on:, 3. What physical layouts are possible
   which would provide disabled passengers using an on-board wheelchair
   full maneuvering room inside the lavatory? What layouts would provi-de
   partial accessibility (e.g., a privacy curtain)? 4. Which designs can
   be.accomplished without the loss'of revenue seats?' Which designs can.
   be, accomplished with'only r .' _ :.\ _ - minimal loss of revenue
   seats?' . ._ .' . . Comments: Some accessible lavatory configurations
   can be accomplished without the loss of passenger seats. However,
   achieving full accessib-ility without passenger seat loss more often
   than not will cause loss of other amenities such as galleys and
   closets. A reduction in passenger seat pitch could also result in
   yielding less leg room in coach compartment. Such features represent
   marketing advantages to air carriers and their loss can also translate
   into lost revenue, although a much less tangible and quantifiable loss
   than that due to seat removal. / The more permanent the enclosure, the
   greater the seat or space loss. Designs which use temporary lavatory
   enclosures can usually be accomplished without the loss of seats.
   Designs which do not use temporary lavatory enclosures will cause.a
   loss of passenger seats or other amenities unless a limited transfer
   capability is acceptable. Minimizing the loss of seats in the latter
   case will depend on the type of aircraft and available locations for
   lavatories. The following accessible lavatory design concepts were
   developed as.described in'the comments to questions 1 and 2 and address
   the - potential impact to lavatory maneuvering room and revenue loss
   -with all aircraft models equipped with 100 to 199 seats: (Ref.
   Appendix A.) The conceptual diagrams depicted in Appendix A illustrate
   various.possible means to accommodate wheelchair accessible lavatories
   within different aircraft configurations. Spatial configuration was the
   primary consideration for these designs; other factors such as flight
   attendant access to the cabin jumpseats, emergency equipment (i.e.,
   fire extinguishers, first aid and emergency oxygen), and communication
   systems were not specifically considered. In some designs, access
   between the . b cockpit and the main cabin is restricted when the
   accessible lavatories are in use for short periods of time during the
   cruise phase of the'flight. Therefore, no inferences should be made
   regarding the ultima,te practicality of some of these diagrams.
   However, discussions during the meeting produced a clear understanding
   that a complete aircraft design process can and does account for all of
   these systems as required by applicable FAR Parts 25 and 121. . .

   lavatory.which .allows fu.11 accessibility" .7 - _, 1 _. .
   including-go-degree dependent 'and independent.. - transfers from an
   on-board wheelchair. 'This -' design concept may result in the loss of
   2 first-class or 3 tourist-class passenger seats or 1 significant
   closet/galley unit." No commercially available aircraft lavatory
   configurations meet the spatial requirements of this concept, although
   some conceptual designs do. Design Concept B. Comprises an enlarged
   lavatory with enclosure which allows full accessibility including. 90-
   degree dependent and independent transfers from an on-board wheelchair.
   This design concept .may result in the loss of 3 tourist class
   passenger seats or a minor reduction in closet/galley space.'.No
   commercially available aircraft lavatory configurations meet the
   spatial requirements of this concept. Some proposed designs would meet
   this requirement. 'Diagram in Appendix A incorporating Design Concept A
   show the potential loss of 3 tourist class passenger seats. However,
   since these are conceptual designs only, during discussions on March 31
   and April 1, 1993, some Committee members suggested that the actual
   designs might result in the loss of 5 seats. 'Diagram in Appendix A
   incorporating Design Concept B does not show the potential loss of 3
   tourist class passenger seats, however dialogue during meeting of March
   31 and April 1, 1993, indicates that depending upon the location of the
   toilet, there may be a loss of 3 tourist class passenger seats. 7
   Design Concept C. -Comprises a slightly enlarged lavatory with an
   adjacent enclosure which limits access to no greater than a go-degree
   independent 'transfer from an on-board wheelchair. This design concept
   assumes no loss of passenger seats or closet/galley space. Several
   existing aircraft lavatory configurations, with minor modification, can
   meet the spatial requirements of this concept. This concept
   accommodates fewer persons with disabilities, than A or B .above. __
   ..; ,_ . . ,-, - ,. - .* . ,Design Concept D. Comprises ah existing
   standard size lavatory . with an enclosure which limits access to 180-v
   ' degree independent transfer from the on-board wheelchair. This
   configuration will ' generally prohibit access to wheelchair users who
   cannot stand. This design concept will not result in the loss of any
   passenger seats or closet/galley space. Most existing aircraft lavatory
   configurations, where modified to include the enclosure, can meet ..the
   spatial requirements of this concept. This concept accommodates fewer
   persons with disabilities than A, B, or C above. Some members of the
   Committee who represent persons with disabilities do not consider that
   concepts C and D meet the requirements of an accessible lavatory.
   Advice on: 5. How would such arrangements affect passenger traffic
   within the cabin, flight attendant duties in the galleys., and the
   passenger ease of access to the remaining lavatories? Comments.;. -.
   Configurations which use a self-contained lavatory do not by their very
   nature affect traffic in the cabin or crew activities except for normal
   use of this space for lavatory queuing and entrance, depending on their
   positioning. Configurations involving lavatory enclosures may occupy
   galley space and/or cabin aisle space when in use. These configurations
   may affect normal passenger movement, crew activities, and cabin
   service. Additionally, the aisle between two opposing lavatories may be
   used to create adequate enclosed space for'an accessible lavatory, thus
   eliminating use of the other lavatory by other passengers. 8 VlCP Qn :
   6. How might .such arrangements impair safety, if-at all? Comments: The
   Committee determined in some of the proposed configurations that it is
   possible to achieve accessibility . . without impairing safety. Safetv
   1~ ovev no= ly with 14 CFR Parts a. vice Qn: - I. 7, In small planes,
   where can the on-board wheelchair be stored? Comments: Different styles
   of on-board wheelchairs require different amounts of space. Most
   airlines have selected one chair which best matches their current fleet
   configurations. While not currently a requirement to carry the
   wheelchairs on board single aisle aircraft unless requested by a
   passenger, most carriers have elected to permanently carry them on
   aircraft with 100 or more seats. Most current aircraft configurations
   provide for space in a closet or floor-mounted bin. Space also exists
   in some configurations in overhead bins and under seats. Should these
   areas be removed or reduced in size to accommodate an accessible
   lavatory, available on-board stowage space may become an issue. : 8.
   Downto what size airplanes and for what types can accessible lavatory
   requirements reasonably be imposed? Per DOT instruction: this Committee
   considered aircraft with 100 seats or more based on the certified
   maximum capacity rather than operator-specific configurations. We
   received information on aircraft with fewer than 60 seats, but very
   little on aircraft with 60-99 seats. Much t with f e w e r 1OQ seats. .
   9 9. Should any requirements for accessible lavatories be made a
   function of stage length instead of airplane size, and if so for what
   stage lengths should such requirements be imposed? How would this
   approach alter air carriers' operational flexibility? Cpmments: . -. .-
   Members of the Committee agreed that aircraft size was the ' ...'. _=
   .- .' better parameter since airlines -use the same aircraft fok.a- *_.
   ('. variety of stage lengths. Operational flexibility would be greatly
   impaired by using a stage length criterion. : 1. Installation of an
   accessible lavatory can be achieved on both type certificated aircraft
   (aircraft in production) and new -type design aircraft. New type design
   aircraft, which are aircraft designs not yet certified by FAA, allow
   for a "ground up" systems approach that integrates the lavatory as part
   of the original aircraft layout. A new type design enables engineers to
   maximize the interior cabin space at a lower overall cost to the
   operator. Type certificated aircraft, which are already in production,
   may require extensive and costly design modifications to install an
   accessible lavatory. Production aircraft will require engineering
   feasibility studies to determine the structural and system
   modifications needed for installation of a new lavatory. In some cases,
   installation of an accessible lavatory may adversely affect the
   aircraft's flight characteristics as well as operational and safety
   procedures. : Accordingly, design, operational, and safety-assessments
   must .,be considered:, However, the existing types of aircraft .designs
   may be able to'be optimized by using current lavatory locations and
   the,use of existing space and moveable lavatory enclosures to provide
   an accessible lavatory that affords equivalent privacy. Current
   production aircraft design modifications must be certified by FAA and
   require approximately two years' lead time before the first aircraft is
   delivered to an air carrier. The costs associated with the installation
   of accessible lavatories vary by aircraft type,.size, and the degree of
   accessibility provided. 10 . .Each design concept discussed below has
   different space requirements. In some cases, the design'may lead to
   loss*of seats which can be quantified. -In other cases, the accessible
   lavatory can be accommodated by removing or decreasing the size of a
   storage unit or closet. This will have some effect on service but is
   non-quantifiable. Cost data were provided by air carrier
   representatives and airframe manufacturers. The estimates are based on
   the assumption of a 100 aircraft order. . an Concent A . fully
   contained lavatory allowing 90 degree. . . . dependent and independent
   transfer from anon-board wheelchair '-;.'; - Cost per aircraft =
   $150,000 - Possible loss of 2 F/C passenger or 3 T/C passenger seats
   ($300,000) revenue loss per aircraft or loss of one significant
   closet/galley unit (non-quantifiable) Pesign Concept R lavatory using
   lavatory enclosure allowing 90- degree dependent'and independent
   transfer from an on-board wheelchair. - Cost per aircraft = $170,000 -
   Possible loss of 3 T/C passenger seats ($300,00O)revenue loss per
   aircraft or loss of minor closet/galley space (don- quantifiable)
   Pesian Concept C : lavatory using a lavatory enclosure allowing only
   go-degree independent transfer from an on-board.wheelchair. - Cost per
   aircraft = $.l40,000 - No seat or space loss (no revenue loss per
   aircraft) tQ : lavatory using lavatory enclosure allowing only
   180-degree independent transfer from an.on-board wheelchair - C&t per
   aircraft = $20,000 - No seat.or space loss (no revenue loss per
   aircraft) 2. The Accessibility of a lavatory involves more than the .
   dimensions of the module itself. Use of the space is contingent upon
   the design of the on-board wheelchair. The degree of accessibility aiso
   depends upon the design and placement of grab bars, call buttons, call
   lights, signage, warnings, common lavatory amenities, 'sinks, and flush
   controls contained within the lavatory. . il . Departures from
   particular design concepts.are permitted where the alternate means
   provide substantially equivalent or greater access to, and usability
   of, lavatories or lavatory enclosures. Such alternative means are to
   permit individuals with disabilities to approach, enter, and use a
   lavatory as easily, safely, conveniently, and independently as the
   means described above would permit. Carriers can provide
   accessibility'by demonstrating that an alternative method will result
   in equivalent facilitation. - This demonstration is to. involve a
   statistically valid samp1.e i " _ : *. _ - of individuals with
   disabil.ities.and demonstrate independent : . . .' and assisted use of
   the lavatory: The demonstration is-to be - conducted by people trained
   in research techniques who are familiar with the physical requirements
   .of people with disabilities, including methods of transfer, toileting,
   and use of mobility aids. Any alternative method should be validated by
   a demonstration that provides accessibility. The methodology used.in
   the demonstration should be developed in consultation with individuals
   with training in research techniques who are familiar with the physical
   requirements of persons with disabilities, including methods of
   transfer, toileting, and use of mobility aids. 3. Effective Date of
   Final Rule The Committee agreed that the requirements for accessibility
   should reflect those that currently apply to aircraft with more than
   one aisle. In particular, that new aircraft ordered by a carrier after
   the effective date of the rule or delivered more than 2 years after the
   effective date-shall comply The .Committee believes that Design Concept
   A or B is feasible except in one model of one manufacturer's aircraft.
   Design Concept B would permit only independent transfer in that model
   of aircraft. A different design of-on-board chair might permit aircraft
   accessibility in that aircraft as currently designed. Some members of
   the Committee do not consider that concepts C and D meet the
   requirements of an accessible lavatory. 12 . . . , _ `_ .' I. : . . 4 _

   COMMITTEE JULY 29-30 MEETING WASHINGTON, D.C. SUMMARY MINUTES The
   meeting was called to order by'CoChairmen John Bollinger and Rirke
   Comstock. All members were present. Also present were representatives
   of advocacy groups and publishers. Verbatim transcripts of the meetings
   were taken and will be held at DOT for future reference. Members
   introduced themselves and their affiliations. The Committee was
   graciously welcomed by Assistant Secretary Shane and Don Trilling. The
   work of the Committee was greatly facilitated by the untiring support
   of Ira Laster and other DOT representatives. Prior to the meeting,
   members were provided copies of: 1. The original Federal Register
   notice announcing the formation of the Committee and detailing DOT's
   issues to be addressed; 2. the PVA co-sponsored Warren Report defining
   lavatory space needs for padsengers with disabilities; 3. the draft
   suggested Design Guidelines for twin aisle lavatories for passengers
   with disabilities. Since the Committee membership contains both people
   who were involved in developing the original guidelines above and
   others who were not involved, an extended discussion ensued concerning
   these documents and the issues they addressed. Concerns expressed in
   these discussions were, in many cases, similar to those expressed
   during the development of the original design guidelines document. This
   discussion was lively and productive. It is to the credit of the
   Committee members that the many complexities of this previous work were
   covered so expeditiously. The Committee then moved on to a review of
   the issues presented in the Federal Register. Initially it was felt
   that these could be clustered in some manner to provide a focus for
   work by Committee members. As the discussfon progressed, another
   approach emerged that showed more promise as a course of action to
   ultimately address the DOT issues. This approach could be generally
   described a% looking at real life situations in contemporary aircraft

   FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE DECEMBER 9 AND lo, 1992 DEPARTIYENT OF
   TRANSPORTATION HEADQUARTERS WASHINGTON, D.C. SUMMARY MINUTES The
   Committee met to continue its work towards development of a report for
   the Department of Transportation dealing with accessible toilets on
   single-aisle (narrow-body) aircraft. Attached to these minutes are: a.
   The November 16, 1992, Federal Reuister; Notice b. a list of attendees
   at December 1992 meeting b. a data sheet on smaller single-aisle
   aircraft c. presentation material on Fokker aircraft d. presentation
   material concerning accessible features on United 767-300 and 747-400
   lavatories Members again introduced themelves, followed by Ira Laster's
   discussion of a few "housekeeping" mattera. Robert Ashby briefly
   reviewed the lavatory and other accessibility requirements in DOT's
   exi8ting regulation implementing the Air Carrier Accwrr Act. He pointed
   out that there requirements are to be phased in over a period of time.
   The current chargo to the Advisory Committee involve8 single-aisle
   aircraft with loo-199 passenger seats. Suggestiopa for otherwise
   limiting (if at all) the size or quantity of aircraft to be modified
   included using: a. fircraft seat count (maximum capacity). b. Stage
   length (this wad viewed aa being difficult to measure and aunister).
   B-4 Following considerable discussion of possible approaches for
   addressing the "cut-off 1' matter, the one that seemed to have broadest
   support would be based on the following: a. Seat count (maximum). * b.
   A size cut-off for existing designs i.e., 100 seats. C . A size cut-off
   for new designs that goes further, e.g. 60 seats. d. Compliance
   required on new production aircraft delivered 2 years after the final
   rule is issued, or ordered after the effective date of the final rule.
   Although there was no consensus, a majority of the members appeared to
   support something along the above lines. Such an approach was thought
   likely to be presented in the final report, on the understanding that
   other points of view will also be reflected in it. The Fokker Aircraft
   Company presentation showed the difficulties that the Fokker 100 and 70
   aircraft would have, because any accessible lavatories would be bounded
   by large engine support frames and aft pressure bulkheads, much like
   the MD-80. Also, space that might otherwise be used to expand the
   existing lavatory area for accessibility purposes has been preempted by
   electric equipment. The discussion also emphasized the point that
   smaller commuter aircraft not only have seriously limited lavatory
   spaces, but also have access problems in general, due to the
   limitations created by the FAA Exit Row Rule and constrained space
   overall. The Committee's charter (100 seat lower cut-off), plus the
   limitations mentioned earlier, suggests that further consideration of
   smaller commuter aircraft is beyond the reach of the Committee. DOT
   ~~11, nevertheless, be encouraged to pursue a solution for these
   aircraft. B-6 This agrement, of course, places a heavy responsibility
   on members to provide information, concerns, data, etc., to those
   drafting the report. In particular, comments and data should cover: a.
   Scope of a rule . b. Timing of a rule C . Economic
   consequences/benefits d. Consistency with the twin-aisle rule - e.
   Other issues not cited by DOT f. Manufacturing cycle times g* Impact of
   smaller aircraft size on architectural and material design solutions h.
   Passenger cabin-operational safety issues ,1. Conflicts between safety
   rules and access rules (e.g., exit row rule) At the end of the meeting,
   the Committee again went through the nine questions in the original
   Federal Resister notice. These were repeated in the November 16, 1992,
   Federal Resister notice attached to these minutes. To summarize remarks
   at this point in the meeting: Question: 1. Can be done 2-5. Will be
   presented in final report with discussion, tradeioffs, etc. 6. Not
   negotiable, will be safe. 7. A number of locations, not a problem. 8.
   See earlier discussion in minutes. 9. See earlier discussion in
   minutes. Once again, the untiring and professional support of Ira
   Laster and Nancy Ebersole is gratefully acknowledged. Kirke Comstock

   XINUTES The meeting was called to order by Co-Chairmen John .Bollinger
   and Kirke Cornstock. Most members were present. Also present were
   representatives of advocacy groups and publishers. Verbatim transcripts
   of the meeting discussions were taken and will be held at DOT for
   future reference. PIenbers and guests introduced themselves and
   described their affiliations. The Committee was welcomed by
   representatives of the Secretary's staff. The work of the Committee
   continues to be greatly facilitated by the untiring support of Ira
   Laster and Nancy Ebersole from DOT. A copy of the agenda for the
   meeting is attached. As planned at the August meeting, the Committee
   then proceeded with the agenda and the assignments from the previous
   meeting. 1. Evaluation of "Tvnical" Aircraft for Accessibility:
   Excellent presentations were made by representatives of Airbus, Boeing,
   and McDonnell/Douglas. These were developed per the protocol attached.
   Copies were provided to all Committee members. Aircraft evaluated,
   generically, were A-321, MD-80, B-737-30 and B-727-200. All of these
   presentations showed that, in general, sufficient space existed to
   provide dependent trans- fer capability through the use of a lavatory
   enclosure (without seat loss). These were not detailed design studies
   for specific airlines, and details regarding crew seat placement,
   enclosure,material construction, etc., were not addressed. This was a
   "real estate" evaluation. These presentations generated comment,
   concerns, and questions. These included: a. Will future flight
   attendant direct view requirements compromise accessibility? It was
   agreed that this just becomes another item that must be accounted for
   in the final detailed design. There may be an impact on accessibility,
   seat count, or other factors. b. Airlines may have to accept seat loss
   to meet-a social need. Understood, but designers and airlines will
   continue to struggle mightily to avoid such an outcome. The airframe
   companies were complimented for their good work in developing these
   presentations. 2. On-Board Wheelchairs: We were shown three different
   on-board chairs. Some of them were used for subsequent evaluation of
   aircraft at DCA. While there was no need for Committee to make any
   specific recommendations to the FAA on.this subject, this presentation
   did provide further background for members. B-9 5. "Facilitation"
   Demonstration: mm~ Gerry Warren briefly relrFe**-ed the development of
   spatial requirements in his original PVA report (members have copies).
   He then proceeded to preview a videotape used to record the tests
   (using actual disabled subjects). These tests were conducted on a
   specific lavatory design as an "equivalent facilitation" to show that
   this design is adequate per the Design Guidelines. There was a side
   discussion about whether the Warren report numbers were "minimum" or
   "maximum." This will be resolved independently with Paralyzed Veterans
   of America (sponsors of the Report). 6. New Business: 1. Future meeting
   dates. The following dates were agreed to, for planning purposes: 12/9
   and 12/10/92 3/10 and 3/11/93 6/23 and 6/24/93 8/18 and 8/19/93 It may
   not be necessary to have all of those meetings. 2. Action agenda a.
   Aircraft size "cut off"; b. Feasibility of access to narrow-body
   aircraft; Existing guidelines document; and :: Issues Lavatory
   Enclosure as Defined in Existing Guidelines Document Seat Loss/Cost for
   Different Models of Aircraft Warren Video Committee Final Report
   Outline Discussion then ensued with the following outcome: 1. Aircraft
   size "cut off." Everyone agreed that 100 seats is clearly appropriate
   and that more understanding of aircraft in the 60-99 seat range is
   needed prior to deciding whether 60 seats is a more appropriate "cut
   off." ACTION: Mike Rioux, ATA and Walt Coleman, RAA to obtain data on
   any existing aircraft in the 60-99 seat size and forward to Ira Laster
   for distribution to Committee members. . APPENDIX C ..-- .{-:; APPENDIX
