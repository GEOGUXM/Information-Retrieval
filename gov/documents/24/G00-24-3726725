   Companies by Line of Insurance
          The California Department of Insurance's (CDI) "Companies by
          Line of Insurance" page provides the consumer with a list of
          insurance companies, as shown in the 1999 Market Share Report or
          in alphabetical order, that are licensed in California to sell a
          specific line of insurance.

   Premium Comparisons
          The California Department of Insurance (CDI) surveys the largest
          insurers admitted to transact insurance in California and asks
          them to provide premium comparisons for various lines of
          personal insurance. The results of these surveys are designed to
          assist consumers with comparing the premiums they might be
          charged for insurance from one company versus another.

     Need Help Finding an Agent?
     Here are a few tips to help you locate an agent in your area.

     Check to See if Your Agent or Broker is Licensed
     California Insurance Code Section 1725.5 requires that your agent or
     broker display their license number on business cards, quotations,
     and print advertisements.   This tool allows you to use a license
     number or name to research an individual's licensing status with the
     California Department of Insurance.

     Consumer Alert - Enforcement Actions
     The Department has made enforcement a priority of the Department,
     assessing financial sanctions against insurance companies amounting
     to over $37 million during his first term in office and revoking the
     licenses of nearly 450 brokers, agents and other producers who
     violated state law or Department regulations. While the majority of
     the state's 1,500 licensed insurance companies and 200,000 licensed
     producers are honest, hard-working members of a valuable California
     industry, the bad actors in that group that have been sanctioned by
     the Department are identified below.

   Consumer Complaint Study
          In 1999, the Department's Consumer Hotline handled over 530,000
          calls related to general insurance questions. During this same
          period, over 29,500 complaint files were opened in response to
          mail received and complaint calls taken over the Hotline. As a
          result of these mediation efforts, over $16,300,000 was
          recovered for policyholders.

     Complaint Data)

     California FAIR Plan
     With the voluntary insurance markets presence returning to the
     State of California, insurance companies are slowly entering the
     California insurance market and some policyholders that live in "at
     risk" areas no longer have difficulty securing insurance. As a
     result, the California Department of Insurance issued an Executive
     Order that revises the eligible areas for the California FAIR Plan
     coverage to areas in place prior to the statewide expansion of FAIR
     Plan coverage in 1994. If you have FAIR Plan coverage and you are no
     longer in the FAIR Plan's eligible areas for insurance coverage,
     this page will show you how to secure homeowners and commercial
     insurance.
