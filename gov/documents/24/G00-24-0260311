   NASA's Travel-Accident Insurance is designed to combat the financial
   burden produced by these tragedies. This coverage is tailor-made for
   NASA employees. And because of mass purchasing power, you will pay
   remarkably little for this important protection. Two attractive plans
   are being offered.
   These plans are briefly described on the next page. Pay particular
   attention to Plan II where benefits are extended to cover most
   accidental deaths, including those caused by travel accidents. However,
   for full details please refer to the last page where the risks assumed
   by Alta Health are set forth under the headings "Hazards Insured" and
   "Limitations."
