   Assembly Republican Response to Governor Davis State of the State
   Address-Californias Leadership Crisis

   [coxcolor_mid.jpg] Good evening. Just one year ago, Californians were
   worried about keeping the lights on. Skyrocketing energy bills and
   rolling blackouts threw California into a state of crisis. While the
   electricity crisis continueswe now face another crisis. Your state
   government is more than 12-billion dollars in the hole because we have
   simply been living beyond our means.

   Last year, in a bipartisan effort, our president and congress delivered
   significant tax relief. However, just eight days ago California State
   government hit you with a one-point-two billion-dollar tax increase.
   Three years after Governor Davis took office, state expenditures are up
   37 percent, while the population has grown only five percent.

   In the midst of this three-year spending fury governor Davis ignored
   all of the warning signs and could have avoided the budget crisis, the
   state's infrastructure crisis, and the energy crisis. It appears the
   governor's view of fiscal responsibility is to sign an out of balance
   budget with a tax increase. Governor Davis' solution to transportation
   congestion is to delay until 2008 the requirement to use highway taxes
   for highway construction. Governor Davis' solution to the energy crisis
   is to sign long-term, expensive power contracts obligating Californians
   to pay higher electricity prices for the next 15 to 20 years.

   So here we are. After three years, California State government is more
   than a third larger. Our freeways are clogged, and we're told we can't
   afford to protect our citizens without raising taxes. Governor Davis
   and the democrat-controlled legislature didn't listen to all the
   warning calls.

   In 1999, republicans warned the governor of the pending infrastructure
   crisis-and the governor ignored it. In 2000, it was the energy
   crisis-and the governor ignored it again. And last year, we warned the
   governor of the looming budget crisis-and the governor ignored it.
   Based on the governor's three-year record, I submit to you that this
   state faces a crisis of leadership.

   Howeverif they're willingwe stand ready to work with the governor and
   our democratic colleagues to craft a fiscally responsible blueprint for
   California's future. Thank you and good night.
