                             What's New with Renewal Run


     What's New with Renewal Run will keep you up to date on Renewal Run
     activities. The "new" gif ( [new.gif] ) will be present only if you
    have not visited this page since an event was updated. That is, items
         that are new to you will have the "new" image beside them.
