                         White-Collar Crime Program

   Agents assigned to the FBI's Baltimore Field Office are responsible for
   investigating violations of federal law occurring within the states of
   Maryland and Delaware. This responsibility includes violations falling
   within the White-Collar Crime Program, one of this offices highest
   priorities.

   The FBIs White-Collar Crime Program is the largest and most diverse of
   all FBI criminal programs, which include Organized Crime/Drugs, Violent
   Crimes, and Civil Rights. It is a very dynamic program and is changing
   at a rapid rate due to the globalization of communications, travel,
   business activities, and crime. During fiscal year 1998 (10/1/97 -
   9/30/98), the White-Collar Crime Program used approximately 25% of FBI
   Agent resources and achieved 36% of the FBIs total convictions.

   The FBI defines White-Collar Crime as those illegal acts that are
   characterized by fraud, concealment, or a violation of trust and are
   not dependent upon the application or threat of physical force or
   violence. These acts are committed by individuals and organizations to
   obtain money, property, or services; to avoid the payment or loss of
   money or services; or to secure a personal, political, or business
   advantage.

   In an effort to effectively manage the White-Collar Crime Program, the
   FBI has established four sub-programs, to include:
     * Economic Crimes
     * Financial Institution Fraud
     * Government Fraud
     * Public Corruption

   Economic Crimes primarily involve mail and wire frauds, counterfeit
   negotiable securities, bankruptcy, insurance, computer frauds,
   telemarketing and investment frauds, and other business-related frauds
   directed against both individuals and businesses.

   Financial Institution Fraud investigations primarily involve check
   frauds, loan frauds, embezzlements, misapplications, and bribery
   matters occurring within or against national and international
   financial institutions, such as banks, savings and loans, and credit
   unions.

   Government Fraud investigations focus on fraud, corruption, and
   conflict of interest in all federal agencies and programs. It also
   includes environmental crimes, health care fraud, and anti-trust
   violations.

   Public Corruption initiatives are aimed at combating breaches of public
   trust by federal, state, and local officials and their private sector
   accomplices.

   Rather than assign a particular priority to each of the sub-programs,
   the FBI has identified priority crime problems within the program as a
   whole and uses national initiatives to attack them. The following is a
   list of these identified crime problems:
     * Health Care Fraud
     * Telemarketing Fraud
     * Environmental Crimes
     * Financial Institution Fraud
     * Public Corruption
     * Insurance Fraud
     * Bankruptcy Fraud
     * Securities Fraud
     * Computer Crimes
     * Fraud Against the Government
     * International Frauds/Money Laundering
