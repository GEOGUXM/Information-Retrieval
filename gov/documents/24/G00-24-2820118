Revisions to OSC Regulations on Filing a Complaint or Disclosure

   OSC revised its regulations at 5 CFR Part 1800 on filing complaints and
   disclosures. The final rule was effective December 1, 2000. The revised
   regulation requires the use of Form OSC-11 (see Forms and Publications)
   to file a complaint of prohibited personnel practice or other
   prohibited activity (other than a complaint alleging only a Hatch Act
   violation).
