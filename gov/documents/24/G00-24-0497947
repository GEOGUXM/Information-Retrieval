About This Site

   The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve Web site
   is designed to provide the public with a rich array of information
   about the development and management of this Reserve. This page
   describes the general purposes of the site, summarizes editorial
   policies, and provides brief technical and navigational information.

Purpose and Principles

   The Executive Order authorizing the creation of the Northwestern
   Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, signed on December 4,
   2000 directs that the Secretary of Commerce "in consultation with the
   Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of Hawaii shall develop a
   plan to govern the management of the Reserve." The development of this
   plan will be an important national undertaking, and have profound
   significance in our nation's continuing progress in marine
   conservation. This Web site is a principal medium to provide the public
   with information on the evolution of the management plan including
   advice from the Reserve Council.

   This Web site is primarily targeted to institutions and individuals
   with specific interest in marine conservation and the Northwestern
   Hawaiian Islands Reserve. It is also designed to inform NOAA's partner
   agencies on progress towards the management plan. Other important users
   include marine researchers, educators and students.

   In the months ahead, considerable information will be produced on the
   Reserve. NOAA intends that this Web site be the primary vehicle for
   wide and prompt distribution of this information.

   Browsers. This site is designed to be completely compatible with
   Netscape Navigator (v4.0 and above, recommended) or Microsoft Internet
   Explorer (v4.0 and above, recommended); however, other browsers can
   also be used.

   Access Time. Some pages on this site contain several images. The
   purposes of these images are to provide necessary visual supplements
   for the text (e.g., maps of the reserve preservation areas) and enhance
   the visual appeal of the page. All images have been provided with
   captions that allow those readers who do not load images immediately to
   select specific images for viewing. Pages have been developed to load
   the text first. Some larger images are provided on the page in reduced
   form. The caption provides access to a larger image in a separate page.

   Organization of Pages and Exhibits. Pages are organized in a simple
   linear manner for easy reading and printing. Supplemental material or
   exhibits (Tables, Figures, and Supplementary Text) are numbered
   throughout the page.

   Links. Some links are provided to other Web sites as reference or
   supplemental material. External sites accessed by such links will
   appear in a separate window.

   Fonts and Type Sizes. Times is the default font for this site; 12 point
   is the default size. All browsers allow users to select specific fonts
   and type sizes for display. Some users select large type sizes for ease
   of reading, or specific fonts for personal tastes. The text and layout
   should not be adversely affected by a user's selection of alternative
   fonts and type sizes.

   Printing Pages. This site has been designed to ensure simple printing.
   We recommend printing in portrait format at a scale of 85 to 100%.

   site as downloadable files in Portable Document Format (pdf). These
   files can be viewed on microcomputers equipped with recent versions of
   Adobe Acrobat Reader. Adobe Acrobat Reader can be downloaded for free
   from the site.

   Navigation. Navigation through the site is straightforward. There are
   two levels of hierarchy. The first level is on the left column. The
   second is within the page for either exhibits (see above), page
   markers, or branching pages.
