                         NASA Copyright Notification
     __________________________________________________________________

  GENERAL CONDITIONS:

   NASA images generally are not copyrighted. You may use NASA imagery,
   video and audio material for educational or informational purposes,
   including photo collections, textbooks, public exhibits and Internet
   Web pages. This general permission does not include the NASA insignia
   logo (the blue "meatball" insignia), the NASA logotype (the red "worm"
   logo) and the NASA seal. These images may not be used by persons who
   are not NASA employees or on products (including Web pages) that are
   not NASA sponsored.

   If the NASA material is to be used for commercial purposes, especially
   including advertisements, it must not explicitly or implicitly convey
   NASA's endorsement of commercial goods or services. If a NASA image
   includes an identifiable person, using the image for commercial
   purposes may infringe that person's right of privacy or publicity, and
   permission should be obtained from the person.

  SPECIFIC CONDITIONS:

    1. NASA does not endorse or sponsor any commercial product, service,
       or activity.
    2. The use of the NASA name, initials, any NASA emblems (including the
       NASA Insignia, the NASA Logo and the NASA Seal) which would express
       or imply such endorsement or sponsorship is strictly prohibited.
    3. Use of the NASA name or initials as an identifying symbol by
       organizations other than NASA (such as on foods, packaging,
       containers, signs, or any promotional material) is prohibited.
    4. NASA does permit the use of the NASA Logo and Insignia on novelty
       and souvenir-type items. However, such items may be sold and
       manufactured only after a proposal has been submitted to and
       approved by a representative from the Public Services Division (see
       above information for address, numbers, etc.) in accordance with 14
       CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 1221. Permission is granted
       on a nonexclusive basis as it is not NASA's policy to grant
       exclusive rights to use any of the Agency identities.
    5. No approval for use is authorized by NASA when the use can be
       construed as an endorsement by NASA of a product, service, or
       activity.
    6. NASA emblems should be reproduced only from original reproduction
       proofs, transparencies, or computer files available from NASA
       Headquarters. Please be advised that approval must be granted by
       the Public Services Division (see above information for address,
       numbers, etc.) before any reproduction materials can be obtained.
