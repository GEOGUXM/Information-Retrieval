   How to Reach Us . . .

        PLEASE NOTE:

        * If you have complaints about our agency, use our on-line complaint
          form.
        * If you have complaints with your utility company or problems with
          your utility bill, contact the California Public Utilties
          Commisison's Consumer Services Division. Customers of SMUD or LADWP
          or other municipal utilities will need to call their local utility
          company's ombudsman as the CPUC does not handle those complaints.
