   and weekday social and recreational activities.

   Student Symposium
   The symposium seeks to promote undergraduate and graduate student
   research by providing a forum to experience the art of presenting
   technical research. Participants will develop an understanding of the
   scientific research process and expand their skills and knowledge
   within their academic fields of study. Specifically, the purposes of
   this symposium are to increase awareness of the student research
   achievements; provide models of exemplary research; and to facilitate
   student participation in the national laboratories' scientific and
   engineering communities. The symposium creates a unique environment for
   celebrating and fostering appreciation of the valuable role you play in
   complementing the research experience.
