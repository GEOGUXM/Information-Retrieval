   Implementation Issues for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research
   Most Recent Frequently Asked Questions:
   January 18, 2002
    1. I am a researcher and currently have an active NIH award. The
       scientific knowledge gained from the project funded by this award
       could be expanded if I include human embryonic stem cells in my
       studies. May I use NIH support to include this research?  Answer
    2. Is NIH now approving expenditures for the acquisition and use of
       human embryonic stem cells?  Answer
    3. What is NIH doing to help the sources of eligible human embryonic
       stem cell lines produce and distribute them?  Answer
    4. I am preparing a grant application for the next deadline and have
       not yet finalized a materials transfer agreement with a source of
       the human embryonic stem cells. If I submit my application for this
       deadline, will it undergo review and consideration for
       funding?  Answer
