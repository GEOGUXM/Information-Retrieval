   Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA)4 Designated in 1998, the Milwaukee HIDTA
   is responsible for all of Milwaukee County. ÿ Executive Office for Weed
   and Seed5 There are two Weed and Seed sites found in Milwaukee. Crime
   and Drug-Related Crime6 ÿ In 2000, 44,752 Index crimes and 32,727 other
   crimes were reported to the Milwaukee Police Department. ÿ Many of the
   Milwaukee homicides arose from arguments in which alcohol was often a
   factor. ÿ Homicides also often involve persons who are believed to be
   drug users or dealers, or gang members, or who are engaged in criminal
   behavior such as robbery at the time of the homicide. Murders by
   strangers and unknown offenders often involve drugs or robberies to get
   money for drugs. ÿ During 2000, there were 3,327 adult arrests for drug
   abuse violations. ÿ Most of the Milwaukee drug arrests during 2000 were
   for possession, primarily of marijuana. ÿ Drug sale arrests accounted
   for more than a third of Milwaukee drug arrests. These arrests
   primarily involved the selling of cocaine and opiates. ONDCP

   Driving Intoxicated 9 Liquor Offenses 288 Drugs ÿ Within the Milwaukee
   HIDTA region, powder and crack cocaine, and marijuana represent the
   predominant drug threats. Heroin and methamphetamine have also been
   identified as emerging trends. ÿ Among the drugs distributed within the
   Milwaukee HIDTA region, cocaine remains the drug of choice. ÿ Another
   significant threat includes the increase in domestically grown
   marijuana. While the most common source of marijuana in the region is
   Mexico, local indoor grow operations have risen in popularity. ÿ Heroin
   trafficking and abuse is also increasing. ÿ Law enforcement agencies in
   the HIDTA region have observed the presence of three other drugs in the
   community: Vicodin, a prescription medication; psilocybin (known ONDCP
   Clearinghouse 3 on the street as "shrooms"), and LSD. These three drugs
   are particularly prevalent among teenagers. ÿ Additionally,
   prescription medicine abuse increased 200% between 1997 and 1999. ÿ
   Methamphetamine trafficking and abuse has not reached Milwaukee County
   as a priority concern for law enforcement. Enforcement ÿ Milwaukee
   HIDTA Initiatives include the following:8 * Common Thread Task Force
   Focusing on the North side of the city of Milwaukee, this initiative
   identifies individuals/organizations involved in the import and
   distribution of cocaine. * Heroin Task Force  This initiative focuses
   on the identification, infiltration, disruption, and dismantling of
   heroin drug trafficking organization operations throughout Milwaukee
   County. * Safe & Sound  This anti-drug/anti-crime initiative attacks
   the interrelated problems of drugs, gangs, and guns. ÿ As of October
   31, 2000, there were 2,438 full time law enforcement employees working
   in Milwaukee. 2,013 of these employees were officers, while the
   remainder were civilians.9 Trafficking and Seizures10 ÿ Highway and
   airline trafficking are the primary means of drug importation in the
   Milwaukee area. Using these transportation methods, street gangs and
   other criminal organizations have developed effective distribution
   systems within Milwaukee County. ÿ Drug trafficking organizations in
   the Milwaukee HIDTA area utilize a variety of legitimate and front
   businesses to launder their proceeds. ÿ On the south side of Milwaukee,
   the Hispanic gangs are highly territorial, while large national street
   gangs control trafficking on Milwaukee's north side. These groups
   maintain close ties with similar gangs in Chicago. ÿ Most cocaine
   distribution groups have Mexican-based sources of supply, both inside
   and outside the HIDTA region. Street gangs process crack cocaine within
   the neighborhoods to avoid the heavy penalties for crack importation. ÿ
   Although Chicago remains the most frequently cited source of heroin,
   recent seizures indicate direct shipments, notably South American
   heroin, from source countries. ÿ The Milwaukee area is used as a
   transshipment point for the majority of drug profits garnered in
   Wisconsin. The proceeds are forwarded to source cities via private and
   commercial vehicles, ticketed commercial transportation, or mail
   delivery services. ÿ An increase in purchases of guns and illegal gun
   trafficking has become an integral part of gang drug activity, and the
   availability of weapons is the primary reason for increased gang
   violence. ÿ During 2000, seizures of cocaine and opiates had a street
   value of $580,000. ÿ Seized marijuana during 2000 had a street value of
   $2.4 million. ONDCP Clearinghouse 4 Courts ÿ As of August 8, 2001,
   there were no drug courts operating in Milwaukee. However, there was
   one drug court being planned at that time.11 Consequences of Use ÿ
