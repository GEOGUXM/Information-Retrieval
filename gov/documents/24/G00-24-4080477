What is ISEM?

                                                                        [sm_isem.gif]

   The Information Technology Systems Engineering and Management (ISEM)
   Support Services Task Order is an IT support vehicle awarded to Science
   Applications International Corporation (SAIC).  ISEM is structured as a
   performance based, cost plus award fee task order to provide NASA
   Headquarters with a flexible contract vehicle to support NASAs mission
   and IT objectives.
   While ISEM is a separate and distinct IT support vehicle under the
   direction of Code CI, it is complementary to the Outsourcing Desktop
   Initiative for NASA (ODIN) delivery order.  Together, ODIN and ISEM
   will provide comprehensive IT services at NASA Headquarters.
