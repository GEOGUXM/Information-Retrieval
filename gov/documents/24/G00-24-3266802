   The Office of the State Fire Marshal (SFM) Fire Engineering Division
   administers licensing programs and performs engineering functions
   affecting consumer services and product evaluation, approval and
   listing. The program requires staff with academic training in fire
   protection engineering and other disciplines, as well as technical
   expertise in laboratory testing procedures.

   Principles of fire engineering are also used to reduce or eliminate the
   hazards and risks of wildfire by causing a change in the fire
   environment through: 1) removing or reducing the heat source, 2)
   modifying or reducing the fuels, 3) modifying the act or omission
   allowing the heat source to come into contact with ignitable fuels. The
   proper application of civil, mechanical, electrical, chemical and
   industrial engineering techniques can reduce the number of ignitions
   caused by hazardous conditions or operations. Additionally, the Fire
   Engineering Division combines ignition management and fire hazard and
   risk through fuel modification, vegetation management and hazard
   reduction.
