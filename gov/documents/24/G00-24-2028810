INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AT USAID

                                     >> USAID Home >> Information Technology

      The distribution of information has become a very important aspect of
      global development. USAID has dedicated itself to empowering developing
      countries with the knowledge and technology to not only survive but to
      thrive in the electronic global climate. Here are a number of USAID's
      Information Technology efforts:

                                 AfricaLink
      The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is
   engaged in a number of initiatives to facilitate access to the Internet
      for its colleagues and partners in Africa. One such initiative is
                                AfricaLink.
                              DOT-COM Alliance
    Digital Opportunity through Technology and Communication Partnerships
        (DOT-COM) is a set of three cooperative agreements to promote
    information and communication technology for development. Building on
      the strategies of the African Leland initiative and the worldwide
    Internet for Economic Development Initiative, DOT-COM provides USAID
   missions with a broad set of tools to participate in a global effort to
                         bridge the digital divide.
                          Gemini Application Server
      Gemini is a new application server that is maintained by USAID's
    Internet Data Services. Currently, this server contains web-enabled,
      database driven applications. This server contains the following
   applications: The AfricaLink Project, USAID Employee E-mail Directory,
    the USAID Fax Directory, the USAID Phone Directory and the Office of
                         Procurement's YellowBook.
                       Internet Center for Development
    USAID works around the world in close collaboration with contractors,
      cooperating organizations, and grantees to implement development
     programs. Sharing information in tough environments is a difficult
         task. The Internet Center for Development is here to help.
             Internet for Economic Development (IED) Initiative
      In November 1998, the U.S. Government announced the Internet for
    Economic Development (IED) Initiative to expand access in developing
     countries to the Internet and its applications such as e-commerce,
     distance education, e-governance, tele-medicine, and environmental
       surveillance. Activities are already underway in 21 countries.
                              Leland Initiative
      The Leland Initiative is a five-year, $15 million U.S. government
      effort to extend full Internet connectivity to 20 or more African
    countries. The Leland Initiative builds on existing capacity with the
   ultimate aim of facilitating Internet access throughout each country.
                           Remote Access to AIDNET
    The Remote Access site provides all the information and instructions
     necessary for USAID employees, contractors, and partners to access
      USAID's network from remote locations, such as their homes or an
                         offsite business location.
        South Africa Regional Telecommunications Restructuring (RTR)
      The RTR Program objective is to help ensure that Southern African
     Development Community (SADC) member states realize the significant
   economic and social benefits of a modern information infrastructure and
      have the resources, both technical and financial, to develop it.
