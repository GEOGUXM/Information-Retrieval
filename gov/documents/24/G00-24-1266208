                            Jupiter's Ring System

   Jupiter's ring was discovered by Voyager 1 in a single image that was
   targeted specifically to search for a faint ring system. Subsequently,
   Voyager 2 was reprogrammed to take a more complete set of images. The
   ring is now known to be composed of three major components. The main
   ring is about 7000 km wide and has an abrupt outer boundary 129,130 km
   from the center of the planet. The main ring encompasses the orbits of
   two small moons, Adrastea and Metis, which may act as the source for
   the dust that makes up most of the ring. At its inner edge the main
   ring merges gradually into the halo. The halo is a broad, faint torus
   of material about 20,000 km thick and extending halfway from the main
   ring down to the planet's cloudtops. Just outside the main ring is a
   pair of broad and exceedingly faint gossamer rings, one bounded by the
   moon Amalthea and the other bounded by the moon Thebe.

     A Jupiter "Day" (QuickTime (MOV) format, 2.6 Mbytes)
   Jupiter and its ring system as seen from the surface of the moon Io.
       The ring grows in brightness as Io goes around to the dark side of
       Jupiter because the ring's dust scatters light very efficiently at
       high phase angles. The tiny moons Adrastea and Metis, which are
       embedded within the rings, can also be seen. This was a full motion
       NASA video converted to QuickTime format.
