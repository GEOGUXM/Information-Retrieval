           The mission of the Mesoscale Atmospheric Processes Branch is to
    conduct research to understand the physics and dynamics of atmospheric
        processes through the use of satellite, aircraft and surface-based
   remote sensing observations and computer-based simulations. Development
          of advanced remote sensing instrumentation (primarily lidar) and
     techniques to measure meteorological parameters in the troposphere is
              an important focus. Key areas of investigation are cloud and
            precipitation systems and their environments from the scale of
          individual clouds and thunderstorms through mesoscale convective
   systems and cyclonic storms, and up to the scale of the impact of these
              systems on regional and global climate. The processes of the
     interaction of the atmosphere with the land and ocean surface beneath
   it are also of high priority.   The Branch consists of approximately 70
          people, including 19 civil servants, post-doctoral personnel and
     individuals associated with private companies. 36 Branch members have
       Ph.D.'s and 27 have Master's degrees in the Atmospheric Sciences or
      related fields. Branch research may be broadly categorized into four
                                                                    areas:
     * Precipitation and Convective Systems
     * Modeling and Dynamics
     * Sensor Development
     * Visualization Programs
