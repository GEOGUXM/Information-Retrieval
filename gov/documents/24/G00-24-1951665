                              Welcome to Mac OS
                            Personal Web Sharing

   This page is being served from your Mac OS computer. If you're
   connected to the Internet, you can make it available to everyone in
   your organization, regardless of the browser or the computer they use.

   You'll find sharing files on the Web almost as easy as browsing. Just
   create your pages and drop them into the Web Pages folder. Apple
   Personal Web Sharing will make them available to the person in the next
   cube, the next state, or the network link on another continent.

  Quick Start: Setting Up Personal Web Sharing

   Here's a quick summary of setting up Personal Web Sharing on your
   computer.
    1. Read the "read me" document first. It contains late-breaking
       information about the software.
    2. Install the software, by double-clicking the WebScript icon in the
       Web Sharing folder.
    3. Read the instructions for Apple Personal Web Sharing, in the
       document "Using Personal Web Sharing." These instructions provide
       step-by-step procedures for setup and operation of the software.
       Note: If you want to print the instructions, open the document in
       your browser and print from it to avoid seeing the HTML tags in the
       printed copy.
    4. Make sure you have a valid network connection, properly configured
       for intranet use. (Consult your network administrator or other
       network expert if you need assistance.)
    5. Turn on Mac OS Personal Web Sharing in the Web Sharing control
       panel and note the address that appears next to "My Address" in the
       control panel. (Be sure to copy the address exactly as it appears.
       If you see two addresses, you can use either one.)
    6. Add the content you want to share to your Web Pages folder.
    7. Give your address to the people on your intranet. They can connect
       to your server by loading that address in their browser. (See
       "Using Personal WebSharing.html" for information on limiting access
       to your server or to parts of its content.)

   To make it easy for you to create your own Web pages, we've included
   several sample files and templates with the Personal Web Server. See
   the document "Using Sample FilesTemplates.htm" (in the Sample Files &
   Templates folder) for information about adapting these files for your
   content.

   In addition, you can substitute your own content for the text,
   graphics, and links in this document to create a customized welcome
   page. It's named "Default.html" and is in your Web Pages folder.
