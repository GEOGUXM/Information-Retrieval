   A. Chapter Overview Chapter V provides a description of SFA's
   Modernization Sequencing Plan. The Sequencing Plan is a roadmap for our
   journey from yesterday's way of doing business to the future's target
   architecture. It describes how we'll make changes, when we'll implement
   the changes, and who will benefit from them. Section A, the Chapter
   Overview, provides an explanation of the benefits students, schools,
   financial partners, and employees will receive from modernization once
   the Sequencing Plan is implemented. Section B outlines the related
   Benefits/Outcomes associated with improving each channel's core
   business processes. Section C, the Summary of Modernization Initiatives
   and Projects, begins to describe the overall sequencing approach by
   providing a high level view of initiatives and projects. Section D
   presents SFA's schedule for implementation of future modernization
   activities. Section E outlines the Sequencing Plan for Levels I and II
   by channel. This is a further description of the high level view
   provided in Section C. July 15, 2000 Page V.A-1 How to Navigate through
   This Chapter This chapter is organized in layers, and it drills down
   through the layers into progressively more detail. Here is an example
   of how to navigate through the layers. The Introduction, beginning on
   page V.A-6, gives you a useful overview to set the stage. Start with
   page V.A- 9 and look at Figure V.A-2., Sequencing Plan-High Level View.
   ! It shows we have core business processes (at the top of the
   illustration). One of those is Aid Awareness (at the left side of the
   top bar). To learn more about the Aid Awareness core business process
   and how it can affect you, go to the next layer, Benefits/Outcomes.
   Look at page V.B-1, Figure V.B-1. The left-hand column is headed SFA
   Core Business Processes. Drop down one line and you'll the same process
   Aid Awareness, at the left side of the first row. If you read across
   the row, checking the column headings... ! You'll see by the blackened
   dot under the column "Potential Impacts" that the SFA core business
   process "Aid Awareness" will have a high impact on customer
   satisfaction. ! You'll see from the next column, "Benefit/Outcome,"
   that the results of this core process include educating buyers about
   their options, making sure information is clear, increasing awareness
   to a broader customer group, and providing information via multiple
   distribution channels. * The overall set of SFA activities that we're
   pursuing to deliver these benefits is called "Enhanced Aid Awareness."
   To learn more about the specific things we're doing in this set of SFA
   activities, we need to move to the next layer of detail. Move forward
   to Table V.C-1 on page V.C- 2. The same Enhanced Aid Awareness that was
   at the right side of the previous table under the column headed
   Initiatives, is now again under the column headed "Initiative."
   However, now this same Enhanced Aid Awareness has more information
   about what is included. The column to the right, headed "Projects"
   gives you still more detail about what we're doing for this initiative.
   Move forward to Figure V.D-1 on page V.D-2. At the top of the
   horizontal bar graph (sometimes called a Gantt chart) is that same
   Enhanced Aid Awareness. The bar shows that we're pursuing this
   initiative (which is comprised of many different July 15, 2000 Page
   V.A-2 activities and projects, as you know) during the period January
   2000 through March 2002. Move forward one page, to figure V.D-2 on page
   V.D-3. This chart shows the same initiatives for the Students Channel,
   and there is the same Enhanced Aid Awareness again. But this time, we
   show two sub-activities with two different time lines. We have already
   started reaching Under-Served Market Segments. We're planning to start
   work on a Student Portal with requirement analysis and design in July
   2000 and other work going through the rest of the year. Move forward
   again to Table V.E-1 on page V.E-8. At the top left of the table is
   that same initiative Enhanced Aid Awareness. It occupies the top row of
   the table. Each row details a different project with a different
   description, identifies the business requirements (from Blueprint
   Chapter III) affected by this project, and shows project status. Notice
   that the students.gov Web page, which is a direct outgrowth of Project
   EASI, is already up and running as a first stage of the Online
   Financial Planning Tool which is part of Outreach to Under-Served
   markets. Subsequent tables give more detail and schedules for the next
   two years beyond FY2000. In summary: you can drill down through the
   Sequencing Plan like this to get more details about projects and
   schedules in every area of our enterprise. July 15, 2000 Page V.A-3

   Chapter V July 15, 2000 Page V.A-5 Introduction The technical
   developments and program enhancements on the following pages represent
   the varying speeds of our growth. We are making changes that cut across
   all parts of SFA, and our schedules for change are flexible-some
   results will happen quickly, while others will take a little longer.
   The rate of our modernization effort is planned in convenient,
   manageable chunks to accommodate the education community's capacity to
   handle these changes. To achieve this, we developed the Sequencing
   Plan, which represents projects based on Channel and Enterprise
   priorities and the availability of resources such as budget, talent,
   and management time. This plan also accommodates the overlapping
   schedules of school award years that last 21 months and federal fiscal
   years that have different timelines. This plan will benefit everyone
   who uses SFA services by modernizing them fast enough to meet future
   needs while positioning us to take advantage of future opportunities.
   These planned initiatives and projects are not the only activities that
   drive the organization's performance, nor do they cover all levels of
   modernization. They are components of the overall picture and are not
   meant to represent a comprehensive list. The organization uses the
   performance plan and other budgetary activities to manage all
   initiatives and drive performance improvements. Over time this document
   will reflect a more comprehensive set of modernization initiatives. The
   Sequencing Plan is based on federal fiscal years which run from October
   through September. Most colleges and universities use a fiscal year
   that runs from July through June and refer to it as an award year. For
   this reason the "award year" is typically viewed as the July through
   June fiscal year rather than the federal fiscal year. The relationship
   between the federal fiscal years and the financial aid processing years
   for the period covered by the Modernization Blueprint is shown in
   Figure V.A-2. SFA operates under the federal fiscal year, but its
   services must be delivered for the financial aid award year. The basic
   organizing principle of business requirements is expressed as business
   processes. The business processes are analyzed for process flows and
   information systems that support the process flows. Related development
   and implementation is expressed in program systems. At a finer level of
   detail, there are subprocess flows and subsystems. This is illustrated
   in Figure V.A-1. In this chapter, the implementation of changed
   business processes are expressed as "initiatives" with one or more
   "projects." These broader terms are used to imply that a number of
   activities must occur in addition to system development for successful
   implementation. Because initiatives are the responsibility of a lead
   channel or the CFO or CIO, the initiatives are organized by area of
   responsibility, with projects listed under initiatives. July 15, 2000
   Page V.A-6 Information systems development can be viewed as
   applications, data integration, and interfaces. This alternate
   perspective is shown in Figure V.A-2. Because almost all system
   development implies the control and transfer of funds, system
   development must be coordinated and integrated with financial
   management. This is also shown in the diagram. All system development
   will be done using a specific technical architecture. Projects then
   implement initiatives. The modification, enhancement or development of
   information systems to meet the requirements of the core business
   processes may include applications, data integration, and interfaces.
   Some projects may develop the technical infrastructure and some may
   develop the fiscal management functionality necessary to support the
   applications. The main aspects of the Sequencing Plan - High Level View
   (Figure V.A-2) are: 1. Core Business Processes-Provides improvements to
   SFA's current core business processes to make them function more like
   "best-in-business" organizations. Business process improvements are
   expected to help SFA achieve its goals of increased customer
   satisfaction, lower unit costs, and increased employee satisfaction. 2.
   Interfaces-Provides a common "face" to students, schools, and financial
   partners. This means that the same set of services are available to
   customers whether they are using the Web, a telephone or fax, paper
   forms, or interacting in person. It also means that common standards
   can be applied to all financial aid programs, rather than having
   different interfaces and processes for each aid program. Title IV data
   that resides with our partners can also be made accessible with this
   interface. The interfaces are planned at the very beginning of the
   modernization program. Subsequent changes to the architecture will take
   place "behind the curtain" and will be transparent to the user
   community. 3. Data Integration-Ensures consistency and integrity of the
   data exchanged between SFA and its business partners. Redundancy of
   data within the legacy application is reduced by creating an integrated
   database. Using data networking, the architecture allows an integrated
   view of all student data, whether that data physically resides with one
   of our partners, within a legacy system or in the SFA corporate
   database. 4. Applications-The modernized architecture will consolidate
   similar processes, thereby reducing redundant or multiple application
   for the separate aid programs. The most important functions will be
   implemented first, while modernization of all business processes will
   be completed in years 2 and 3. 5. The Financial Management
   System-Provides comprehensive management of financial data. Due to its
   importance in the modernization effort, it is being planned separately.
   Data and process redundancy is identified and reduced by replacing
   multiple legacy applications with a single financial management July
   15, 2000 Page V.A-7 system based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
   products. By using COTS financial management software, SFA will be able
   to effectively control costs and have a clear understanding of how well
   it is performing. 6. Technical Infrastructure-Provides the tools,
   platforms, and other technical elements necessary to rapidly implement
   the modernized SFA systems. Integration Architecture Services
   technology is a proven way to reuse existing systems and data within a
   new 3-tier architecture, producing modernized benefits on an
   accelerated schedule. The 3-tier architecture allows SFA to
   incrementally reengineer existing legacy systems, dramatically
   improving system response times, without affecting the way students,
   schools, and financial partners work. "Model-Based" development tools
   provide the flexibility to easily adapt the architecture to the
   changing needs of SFA. These tools can automatically generate
   applications based on updated specifications. All of the tools and
   techniques involved in this "acceleration management" approach will
   enable extremely rapid implementation and deployment of the
   modernization architecture. In this chapter currently planned
   initiatives and projects are summarized by Channel and Enterprise and
   may be related to the concept being implemented. Benefits and Outcomes
   of the initiatives are related to the SFA Core Business Processes with
   Potential Impacts identified for the three performance objectives of
   customer satisfaction, reduced unit cost, and employee satisfaction.
   The schedule for initiatives is related to the federal fiscal and
   financial aid award years in Figure V.D-1; similar information for each
   project is displayed in Figures V.D-2 through V.D-7. July 15, 2000 Page

   Level View July 15, 2000 Page V.A-9 Through the Sequencing Plan
   depicted on the following pages, you'll see details about what we are
   doing, when we're doing it, and how you will benefit from our changes.
   Early Benefits Core business processes are being reengineered to make
   SFA more effective and efficient in its mission "To Help Put America
   Through School". These changes will help SFA achieve their objectives
   of increased customer satisfaction, reduced unit cost, and increased
   employee satisfaction. This plan incorporates new, easy-to-use Web
   interfaces that benefit everyone involved with SFA. Behind the scenes,
   new technology will deliver more useful and convenient packages of
   information to those Web interfaces, using existing data in new
   user-specific bundles. Overall, the process reengineering coupled with
   the new technology will improve customer service and reduce unit costs.
   Cuts in Redundancy The Sequencing Plan reduces and retires redundant
   data and systems, "tombstones." The plan involves a series of small
   steps that gradually build impact, and cut waste and inefficiency. By
   the end of School Year 2002-2003, we will have started the process of
   consolidating all systems, reducing data redundancy and transforming or
   retiring old systems. This is illustrated in the subsystem Sequencing
   Plans throughout this section. Rapid Implementation of the New Baseline
   The Sequencing Plan focuses on delivering a new baseline architecture
   over the next two years. This sets the stage for future SFA evolution.
   The two-year period is short enough to eliminate technology
   obsolescence, and positions SFA for rapid changes in technology and
   services to meet future needs as they evolve. Steady Service While We
   Build a New Future Combining new technology with current programs
   ensures uninterrupted service and cost-effective improvements. As a
   first step, ! We're consolidating our systems into a single location.
   This means that later in the sequence of modernization, we'll be able
   to integrate data and bridge between old and new systems more easily. !
   We're changing our migration and transition schedules to better
   accommodate cyclical peaks. ! We're re-using existing software (such as
   CPS) to smooth the evolution of the business process for aid
   application. July 15, 2000 Page V.A-10 ! We'll use pilots to test new
   technologies before production adoption. For example, RFMS and Access
   America have tested alternative business processes for Aid Origination
   and Disbursement, and we will employ the lessons learned as we
   reengineer our processes. Fast Advances With New Technology Using new
   integration applications (Integration Architecture Services) with
   legacy systems will enable the modernization of the information systems
   architecture in three years. Commercially available integration
   applications cut time and cost while providing new value. These new
   integration applications provide a fast and feasible way to combine the
   functions and data of the legacy system with easy, intuitive Web pages.
   The current business processes of Financial Transactions, Loan
   Repayment, Aid Origination and Disbursement, Decision Support, and
   Program Eligibility and Oversight will all be modernized using such
   combinations of new and legacy systems. Support the Goals of the
   Performance-Based Organization Using modern technology and a clearly
   defined set of goals, we will monitor the performance of each of the
   services and of SFA as a whole. Based on the results, continuous
   process improvement initiatives may be identified consistent with the
   goals of the PBO. July 15, 2000 Page V.A-11 This page intentionally

   business processes in each SFA channel will deliver the benefits and
   outcomes shown below. We've assessed each business process for its
   impact on the three SFA performance objectives: increased customer
   satisfaction, reduced unit cost and more employee satisfaction. The
   initiatives planned for each business process, and the benefits and
   outcomes we expect to realize from the initiatives, are summarized in

   Modernization Initiatives and Projects This section depicts a
   high-level view of the modernization Sequencing Plan. The Sequencing
   Plan places initiatives and projects into specific federal fiscal
   years. To better understand the sequence, the initiatives and projects
   are organized by Business Processes. These processes were described in
   Chapter III. Refer to Figure IV.B-1 Integrated SFA Process Model, which
   lists the business processes by channel, performance management, and
   enterprise. Business processes are supported and reengineered by
   initiatives expressed as a series of related projects. Each of the
   projects is placed on a schedule, and the schedule is compared to the
   fiscal years. A summary of the projects is provided in Table V.C-1,
   which shows how business processes lead to initiatives through concepts
   and yield specific projects. The concept identifies how the initiative
   contributes to the business process. The initiative provides a label
   for the active projects. Because the planning process itself is not
   complete, there will be: business processes that are not yet supported
   by initiatives; initiatives that have no projects or are not completely
   supported by the identified projects; and projects with scopes to be
   defined. The Sequencing Plan covers three full federal fiscal years,
   and the results of some projects may be required before the next
   project can be planned or accomplished. As a result, there will always
   be some business processes and initiatives that are not yet fully
   developed into specific projects. This is appropriate for a dynamic
   planning process such as ours. Initiatives, as a collection of
   projects, are scheduled for time periods that include its supporting
   projects. The Gantt chart in Figure V.D-1 identifies the start and end
   dates for each initiative. This chart lists initiatives under the
   organization that owns and benefits from its implementation. Figures
   V.D-2 through V.D-7 provide further details about the projects under
   the initiatives. The bars on these charts show the requirements
   analysis and design phases separately from the development and
   implementation phases. A management decision to continue, hold or
   cancel the project is required between these two phases. These charts
   show the respective fiscal years and the award years, but not the full
   overlapping 21-month financial aid cycle. Table V.C-1 provides a
   framework of concepts, initiatives, and projects. Each area within SFA
   has identified major concepts that are closely aligned to the goals of
   the organization. These concepts drive the key initiatives of the
   Sequencing Plan. For each initiative one or more projects have been
   identified and scheduled over the next two years. July 15, 2000 Page

   modernization efforts to improve our customer service are progressing
   at a rapid pace. SFA is using the Internet as the basis for many of
   these early initiatives. Use of COTS systems enables rapid
   modernization of the financial management systems. Integration
   Architecture Services technology provides a consolidated single student
   account, bringing legacy application data onto a single Web page. It
   also eliminates the need for multiple entry of aid application data for
   different financial aid programs. Concurrent with these initiatives,
   SFA will complete the redesign of its organizational structure. This
   redesign will support the modernized SFA. As discussed in the
   introduction to the Overall Sequencing Plan within Section C,
   initiatives are scheduled for time periods that include its supporting
   projects. The Gantt chart in Figure V.D-1 identifies the start and end
   dates for each initiative. This chart lists initiatives under the
   organization that owns and benefits from its implementation. Figures
   V.D-2 through V.D-7 provide further details about the projects under
   the initiatives. The bars on these charts show the requirements
   analysis and design phases separately from the development and
   implementation phases. A management decision to continue, hold or
   cancel the project is required between these two phases. This is
   represented by the milestone symbol. Some tasks, such as Enterprise IT
   Architecture, consist only of requirement analysis and design. These
   tasks contribute to other tasks and their implementation. These charts
   show the respective fiscal years and the award years, but not the full
   overlapping 21-month financial aid cycle. July 15, 2000 Page V.D-1 2000
