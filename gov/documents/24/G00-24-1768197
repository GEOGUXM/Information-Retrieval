Certificates of Confidentiality
     __________________________________________________________________

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's)

What are Certificates of Confidentiality?

   A Certificate of Confidentiality helps researchers protect the privacy
   of subjects in health research projects against compulsory legal
   demands (e.g., court orders and subpoenas) that seek the names or other
   identifying characteristics of research subjects.

What is the purpose of the certificate?

   The certificate was developed to protect against the involuntary
   release of personally identified research information of a sensitive
   nature sought through any federal, state, or local civil, criminal,
   administrative, legislative, or other proceedings.

   Certificates of Confidentiality were first issued by the U. S.
   Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as a means of enabling
   drug abuse-related research projects where, in the course of the
   research, the study participants may be providing legally incriminating
   or sensitive personal information. The authority was granted under the
   Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Public Law
   No. 91-513, Section 3(a). The protection afforded by Certificates of
   Confidentiality thus made possible research in substance abuse that may
   not have been possible. In 1974, an amendment extended coverage of the
   Certificates to research on "mental health, including research on the
   use and effect of alcohol and other psychoactive drugs." In 1988, the
   law was amended yet again to broaden the use of Certificates to
   safeguard individuals participating in biomedical, behavioral,
   clinical, and other research. The statute, as amended, pertains to a
   broad spectrum of heart, blood vessels, blood, and lungs related
   research projects.

What protection does a certificate afford?

   Investigators can interpose a Certificate to avoid being required to
   release involuntary disclosure of personally identifiable research
   information about individual study participants. Under this statute:

     "The Secretary [of the Department of Health and Human Services] may
     authorize persons engaged in biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or
     other research (including research on mental health, and on the use
     and effect of alcohol and other psychoactive drugs) to protect the
     privacy of individuals who are the subject of such research by
     withholding from all persons not connected with the conduct of such
     research the names or other identifying characteristics of such
     individuals. Persons so authorized to protect the privacy of such
     individuals may not be compelled in any Federal, State, or local
     civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings
     to identify such individuals" (Public Health Service Act 301 (d), 42
     U. S. C. 241 (d), as amended by Public Law No. 100-607, Section 163
     (November 4, 1988)).

   Accordingly, this special privacy protection can be granted only to
   research (i.e., a systematic investigation designed to develop or
   contribute to generalizable knowledge). It is granted only when the
   research is of a sensitive nature where the protection is judged
   necessary to achieve the research objectives.

   Federal funding is not a prerequisite.

What types of projects are eligible for a certificate?

     * A certificate may be appropriate when the research information is
       of a sensitive nature, as determined by the National Institute on
       Drug Abuse (NIDA) Certificate Coordinator and the protection of a
       Certificate is necessary to achieve the research objectives while
       assuring the study participants' confidentiality. Studies gathering
       information which, if disclosed, could reasonably be expected to
       lead to social stigmatization or job or medical/life insurance
       discrimination, would qualify for a Certificate. Projects eligible
       for Certificates must involve the collection of sensitive
       information which, if disclosed, could have adverse legal
       consequences or be damaging to an individual's financial standing,
       reputation, insurability, or employability.
    What projects are NOT eligible for a certificate?
       Projects NOT eligible for a Certificate are:

     * Projects that are not research-based or research-related.
     * Projects which do not collect personally identifiable information.
     * Projects that are not Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviewed and
       approved.
     * Projects collecting information which, if disclosed, is not deemed
       to involve significant harm or damage to the subject.
       How Does One Obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality?
       The issuance of Certificates of Confidentiality is discretionary.
       The Principal Investigator of a specific research project submits
       an application. It includes assurances of compliance with certain
       basic requisites. Since a certificate is generally issued to a
       sponsoring research institution, the application and its
       assurances, must be signed by a faculty member or a senior
       official.
       Ordinarily, a Certificate is issued for a single project (not broad
       groups or classes of projects). However, for cooperative multi-site
       projects, a coordinating center or "lead" institution can apply
       for, and receive a Certificate on behalf of all member
       institutions. However, the lead institution must agree to be sure
       that all participating institutions conform to the Application
       assurances and inform their subjects appropriately about the
       Certificate, its protections, and the circumstances in which
       voluntary disclosures would be made.
       In what situations may data protected by a Certificate be
       disclosed?
       Data that are protected by a Certificate may be disclosed under the
       following circumstances:

     * Voluntary disclosure of information by study participants
       themselves to physicians or other third parties, or authorization
       by study participants of release of information to insurers,
       employers, or other third parties.
     * Voluntary reporting by the investigator of information, such as
       child abuse or threat of other potential violence by the study
       participant to the participant or others, provided such intention
       is specified in the informed consent document.
     * Voluntary compliance by the researcher with reporting requirements
       of other state laws such as knowledge of a communicable disease,
       provided such intention is specified in the informed consent
       document.
     * Release of information by investigators to DHHS as required for
       audits of research records or to the Food and Drug Administration
       (FDA) as required under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
       (21 U. S. C. ยง 301 et seq).

What is the researcher's responsibility to participants in a study for which
a Certificate has been granted?

   The investigator may not represent the issuance of a Certificate to
   potential participants as an endorsement of the research project by
   DHHS or use it in a coercive manner for recruitment of participants.
   The investigator must use the authority of the Certificate to resist
   compulsory disclosure of individually identifiable research data.

   The study participants should be informed that a Certificate is in
   effect, and be given a fair and clear explanation of the protection it
   affords, including the limitations and exceptions. This information may
   be included in the informed consent document or provided to the
   research participant in an additional information page. Please see
   below some suggested wording:

     We have received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National
     Institute on Drug Abuse, which will help us protect your privacy.
     The Certificate protects against the involuntary release of
     information about your participation in this study. The researchers
     involved in this project cannot be forced to disclose your identity
     or your participation in this study in any legal proceedings at the
     federal, state, or local level, regardless of whether they are
     criminal, administrative, or legislative proceedings. However, you
     or the researcher may choose to voluntarily disclose the protected
     information under certain circumstances. For example, if you or your
     guardian requests disclosure of your participation, the researchers
     will provide research data. The Certificate does not protect against
     that voluntary disclosure. Furthermore, federal agencies may review
     our records under limited circumstances, such as a DHHS request for
     information for an audit or program evaluation or an Food and Drug
     Administration request under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act.

     or

     A Certificate of Confidentiality has been obtained from the Federal
     Government for this study to help insure your privacy. This
     Certificate means that the researchers cannot be forced to tell
     people who are not connected with the study, including courts, about
     your participation, without your written consent. If we see [learn]
     something that would immediately endanger you, your child, or
     others, we may discuss it with you, if possible, or seek help.

   Study participants may also be given a copy of the Certificate,
   although this is not necessary if it would impede the research. Study
   participants should be notified that a Certificate has expired if they
   are recruited to the study after the expiration date of the Certificate
   and an extension of the Certificate's coverage has not been granted.

How are Certificates of Confidentiality issued?

   Under the Public Health Service Act and its amendments, the Secretary
   of the DHHS has the authority to grant Certificates of Confidentiality.
   Prior to 1996, Certificates were issued by the Office of the Assistant
   Secretary for Health of DHSS under a delegation of authority from the
   Secretary. Recently, the authority to issue Certificates has been
   delegated to the individual Institutes of NIH. NIDA has accepted this
   authority for NIDA-funded research projects as well as non-funded drug
   abuse related projects.

   Based on an application from the PI of a specific research project, a
   Certificate is granted in the name of that investigator's institution
   for that project. When more than one institution is participating in a
   project, the PI at the lead institution is responsible for applying on
   behalf of all sites, and a single Certificate is issued in which all
   participating sites are listed. For projects in which an investigator
   conducts research information within the United States, a Certificate
   may be issued for the project to the investigator at his domestic
   institution.

   If the research scope of a project covered by a Certificate should
   change substantially, the PI should request an amendment to the
   Certificate; however, the NIDA Certificate Coordinator may require a
   new Certificate depending on the extent of the change in scope. An
   extension of coverage must be requested if the research extends beyond
   the expiration date of the original Certificate, as research
   information collected after the expiration of a Certificate is not
   protected from compelled release.

What is the process for applying to NIDA for a certificate?

   Projects are not eligible for a Certificate unless they have been
   reviewed and approved by an IRB. Investigators must submit an
   application as outlined in Confidentiality Certificate Application
   Instructions which solicits information about the project and the
   investigator, and submit it, along with IRB review documentation and a
   copy of the informed consent/assent forms to be used in the study, to
   the NIDA Certificate Coordinator. Applications must be signed by the
   PI.

   To obtain more information, to submit a completed application, or to
   request an extension or amendment to an existing Certificate, the PI
   should contact:

   Ms. Jacqueline R. Porter
   NIDA Certificate of Confidentiality Coordinator or
   Ms. Sandra Solomon,

   TEL: 301-443-3877
   FAX 301-443-6893
   E-MAIL: oboikess@mail.nih.gov

How are extensions or amendments to existing Certificates obtained?

   Requests for extensions of an expiration date for a Certificate or for
   other amendments should be made two months prior to the needed date.
   These requests should be accompanied by a justification, documentation
   of the most recent IRB approval, and in the case of an extension, the
   new expected completion date for the research project. They should be
   directed to the NIDA Certificate Coordinator at the address above.

Has the legality of Certificates been challenged?

   There have been court challenges to the confidentiality protections
   afforded by a Certificate. In 1973, the Certificate's authority was
   upheld in the New York Court of Appeals.

What should an investigator do if legal action is brought to release
personally identifying information protected by a certificate?

   A Certificate of Confidentiality is a legal defense against a subpoena
   or court order to be used by the researcher to resist disclosure. The
   researcher should seek legal counsel from his or her institution. The
   Office of General Counsel for DHHS is willing to discuss the
   regulations with the researcher's attorney.
