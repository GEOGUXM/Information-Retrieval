Description


   The Partnership for Advancing Technology in Housing (PATH) program is a
   partnership of 12 federal agencies and the housing industry to
   research, develop, demonstrate, and deploy superior housing
   technologies.   Under PATH's direction, NIST is conducting basic and
   applied research to develop methods for predicting the performance and
   service life of building joint sealant.  Researchers at the Institute
   are investigating degradation mechanisms, improving characterization
   methods, and developing mathematical models of the degradation
   processes.  Stochastic models, which are based in reliability theory
   and life-testing analysis, are included in the modeling efforts.
   NIST SPHERE

   NIST SPHERE (Simulated Photodegradation by High Energy Radiant
   Exposure) technology developed and patented by NIST researchers working
   on the Service Life Prediction of Polymer Coatings consortium.

   To help in understanding the mechanisms of degradation and provide data
   for models, sealant materials are characterized using many techniques
   to capture information regarding both chemical and physical
   degradation, including:
     * Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
     * UV/Visible spectroscopy
     * Nanoindentation
     * Mechanical and Rheological testing
     * Thermal analysis

   Researchers at NIST also are developing improved ways to characterize
   atmospheric environments to which these materials are exposed.
   Characterization of environmental parameters that cause degradation is
   needed to link material properties with service life.  The NIST work
   provides a strong scientific and technical basis for standards used by
   industry.  The research is coordinated with voluntary standards
   organizations and trade associations, industry, and other federal
   agencies.
