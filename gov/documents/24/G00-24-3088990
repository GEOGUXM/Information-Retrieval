   through the coordinated efforts of many state, federal, and tribal
   agencies on both sides of the border. The following contains a list of

   U.S. Federal Agencies

     United States Environmental Protection Agency
     EPA is working with Mexico and U.S. state and local governments to
     protect and improve the environment of the U.S./Mexico border area,
     improve our understanding of the border environment, and increase
     cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico in addressing priority
     environmental issues of the two countries, both inside and outside
     the border area.
     The Border XXI program is a binational, interagency program aimed at
     protecting and improving the environment and environmental health
     while fostering sustainable development in the U.S./Mexico border
     area. Objectives which are central to the Border XXI Program include
     public involvement, decentralization of border decision making, and
     increased cooperation between the different governmental agencies
     operating in the border region.
     USEPA provides grants to several Cal/EPA boards and departments,
     including the State Water Resources Control Board, the Integrated
     Waste Management Board, and the Department of Toxic Substances
     Control. The USEPA has played a key role in securing and
     administering funds for environmental infrastructure projects.

   Infrastructure Financing and Certification

     North American Development Bank
     The North American Development Bank (NADBank) and its sister
     institution, the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC),
     were created under the auspices of the North American Free Trade
     Agreement (NAFTA). The NADBank operates under the November 1993
     Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and
     the Government of the United Mexican States Concerning the
     Establishment of a Border Environment Cooperation Commission and a
     North American Development Bank (the "Charter"). Established in San
     Antonio, Texas, the NADB is a bilaterally-funded, international
     organization, in which Mexico and the United States participate as
     equal partners.

     Border Environmental Cooperation Commission
     The functions of BECC are to:
       Work with the affected states and local communities, private
     investors and nongovernmental organizations in developing solutions
     to environmental problems in the region of 62 miles on either side
     of the US/Mexico border.
       Prepare, develop, coordinate, implement and oversee environmental
     infrastructure projects in the border region, including the design,
     site and other technical aspects.
       Assess the technical and financial feasibility and evaluate
     social and economic benefits of environmental infrastructure
     projects.
       Organize, develop and arrange public and private financing for
     projects. BECC will seek to mobilize private capital to the maximum
     extent possible in order to leverage government funding.
       Certify applications for financing to be submitted to the
     NADBank, or other sources that may request such certification.
       Provide technical and financial planning assistance for
     environmental infrastructure projects, giving preference to projects
     involving potable water supply, wastewater treatment, municipal
     solid waste management and other related projects.

   Tribes

   Twenty-six Indian Tribal Nations recognized by the United States are
   within the Border Region. Some of the lands of these Tribal Nations
   extend into Mexico, and the Tribal Nations do not recognize either
   federal border. Many of these nations have existing and emerging
   environmental programs. Cal/EPA seeks to engage Tribal governments in
   its implementation of the Cal/EPA Border Environmental Program.
