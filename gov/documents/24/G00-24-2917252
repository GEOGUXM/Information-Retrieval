                   China Critical Infrastructure Analysis

                                  China Map

   Increasing population, rapid industrialization, and rising affluence in
   the Peoples Republic of China have raised questions about Chinas
   capacity for meeting its long-term food needs and about the impact of a
   potential grain deficit on the world economy. Questions have also been
   raised about the impact of greenhouse gas emissions that are likely to
   be generated as a result of increased economic activity and energy use.

   The China Infrastructure Initiative has consisted of two components.
   The first involved the convening of a panel of agricultural resource
   stakeholders in Beijing, China. This panel used the Vital Issues
   process to begin to establish the context for developing a decision
   support system for managing Chinas critical infrastructures in order
   to promote the sustainable agriculture and rural development. The
   second component of the Initiative has involved a comprehensive
   critical infrastructure analysis of China performed by Sandia National
   Laboratories. This multi-phase analysis has used dynamic simulation to
   address questions about Chinas ability to meet its long-term grain
   requirements and energy needs and to estimate greenhouse gas emissions
   in China likely to result from increased economic activity and energy
   use.

   the Vital Issues Process [vip_icon.gif]

Vital Issues Panel, December 18, 1996, Beijing, China

   A panel of agriculture resource stakeholders convened to establish the
   context for developing a decision support system for Chinas critical
   infrastructures in order to promote sustainable development. The panel
   achieved consensus on the goal to establish a decision information
   system for Chinas sustainable agriculture and rural development that
   is sensitive to geographical variation and technical advances.

   Advanced Computational Capabilities...
   the Silicon Computer                [chip_icon.gif]

   Sandia National Laboratories has undergone a comprehensive critical
   infrastructure analysis of the Peoples Republic of China. Phase I
   consisted of an analysis of the dynamics of water availability and use
   in China, with particular emphasis on the agricultural end-use sector.
   A dynamic water model was developed to simulate the hydrologic
   budgetary processes in five river drainage basins China. The model was
   designed to assess the effects of changes in urban, industrial, and
   agricultural water use requirements on the availability of water in
   each basin and to estimate the water surpluses and/or deficits in China
   through the year 2025. An agronomic model was also developed to
   generate projects of the water required to service Chinas agricultural
   sector and compare Chinas projected grain production with projected
   grain consumption requirements to estimate any grain surplus and/or
   deficit.

   In Phase II, the water and agronomic models developed in Phase I were
   expanded and refined. Two additional dynamic models-energy and
   greenhouse gas-were developed to simulate energy demand and greenhouse
   gas emissions in China through the year 2025. The four models were then
   integrated into a comprehensive critical infrastructure model for all
   of China that would allow for the exchange of information between the
   separate models and capture the overall dynamics of the integrated
   system. The results summarized in these pages are those of Phase II.

   The China Critical Infrastructure Analysis has successfully
   demonstrated a useful approach for modeling critical infrastructures.

   Access to World-Class Experts...
   the Protein Computer          [chat_icon.gif]

   The Protein Computer component of the Decision Support System will
   provide a distributed collaborative environment for decision makers,
   analysts, consultants, and interested stakeholders to share
   information, exchange data, and analyze the model results real time.
   Opportunities will include videoconferencing, simultaneous viewing of
   silicon computer model results, white board teleconferencing of data
   and ideas, file transfer, as well as chat rooms.
