            Scientists Awarded Patent for Coal-Purifying Bacteria
   [lin-bacteria-w.jpg] Pushing the concept of survival of the fittest
                   to the extreme, scientists at the U.S.
                 Department of Energys Brookhaven National
     Laboratory have developed strains of bacteria able to live in harsh
   environments while chowing down on carbon-rich materials such as coal.
   The bacterias digestive action removes potentially harmful pollutants,
                 and could be used to yield more-efficient,
                        cleaner-burning coal. More...
